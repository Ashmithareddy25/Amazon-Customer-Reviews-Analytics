B0000TB01Y|5.0|Since I have not had the pleasure of attending a performance of this new show, I can only judge it from the quality of its score and lyrics as presented on this recording.<br />There are few new scores that sound original and have a style that is all its own; &quot;Wicked&quot; comes the closest.  It is very post-Pippin Stephen Schwartz, but that is definitely not a bad thing.  The score here is wonderful in its ability to tell a story and to develop characters as well as retaining a pop sensibility that reminds us, the listener, that Broadway musicals do not always have to sound like they were written circa 1950 and still be theatrically successful.<br />There are many great songs here, four of which deserve to become musical theatre standards.  The comedic &quot;Popular&quot;, the showstopping &quot;Defying Gravity&quot;, the beautiful lament &quot;I'm Not That Girl&quot;, and the absolutely heartbreaking &quot;For Good&quot; will remain in anthologies long after &quot;Wicked&quot; stops being performed.  There are few songwriters who are able to craft such diverse and tuneful songs, numbers that linger on in your head after a first listen.<br />Of course, there are other great songs as well.  The opening number, &quot;No-one Mourns The Wicked&quot;, is unique in that rather than establishing a few recurring themes, it is made up of a main theme and a number of interesting musical motifs that are unheard later on.  It is successful in giving the audience a good background to the story.  <br />&quot;The Wizard and I&quot; is great for a belter like Idina Menzel.<br />&quot;What Is This Feeling&quot; develops two characters fairly well and is mildly comedic.<br />&quot;Dancing Through Life&quot; is a great song.  It encompasses many different characters and scenes and is something that musicals often lack: a song that tells a story rather than just serving as filler.<br />&quot;As Long As You're Mine&quot; is extremely poppy, catchy, and pretty.  It's the kind of power love ballad that may suit the musical in which it belongs but also works as a radio Top 40 hit.<br />While I haven't seen the show, most of the reviewers who disliked the play did so mainly because of discrepancies with the novel.  This isn't very fair; the musical should be judged on its own, and whether or not it works as a stage production.  Comparing it to the novel is inherently impossible; the two mediums are completely disparate.<br />Still, the score is great.
B000002UAI|5.0|And it would be nice if there was a album released today that was 1/10 as great as this...Eight days a week,Kansas city,Rock and roll music,Words of love, I dont want to spoil the party,and the beautiful I'll follow the sun.
B0000DD7LB|5.0|If you're a fan of pop music, then you are bound to love this album!  It's an eclectic collection of dance music, ranging from the funky and edgy \\"Toxic\\" to the sultry and sexy \\"Breathe on Me\\" &  \\"Touch of My Hand.\\"  There are so many different sounds on this album that you're bound to find something you like.  I highly recommend this cd, and this is coming from someone who had never previously considered purchasing something from Britney.  I've gotta give her credit because this is one brilliant album!!
B00001ODGR|5.0|This DVD is definetly Styx at their best with Dennis Deyoung. Very well produced DVD with excellent sound. Dennis sounds better than ever with Tommy Shaw. This is definetly a Top rock band in the U.S. even still today along with Journey and REO Speedwagon. This Styx concert includes all the great songs form come sail away to renegade. One of the best DVD's Ive seen!<br />Dont hesitate to get this DVD!
0553583182|5.0|I completely agree with the other 5-star reviewers.  Buy this book!<br />I read it once then went back and reread it with a yellow highlighter.  I've tabbed the pages.  I carry it with me and refer to it nearly every day.  I've ordered copies for friends and family.  This book provided the 'light bulb' (Ah ha!) that had previously eluded me.... now, suddenly, finally, I understand.  <br />The book is really all about the science of mind.  The subconscious is your gateway to the universal mind.  The author tells you how to access that power to achieve happiness, health, abundance, etc.  Meditation, self hypnosis, and/or prayer play a part.  He also gives insight into why things don't always work out the way you want them to (relax, forgive, believe).  Some of the examples are pretty goofy but they help make the point.
B00005JMEW|5.0|hey this movie rocks.  It shows that women can fight just as well as the guys can.  I cant wait till this comes out on DVD and I am going to see Kill Bill Vol 2 on April 16th, 2004.  Everyone should see it!  I heard they reveal \\"The Bride's\\" name and everything.  Bill is the last one she goes after and I can't wait to see what Vol 2 is like!  Check it out!
B00007E8V4|5.0|This album as a whole is amazing. Some songs on their own don't entirely make sense, but in the context of the CD and the build and order, they have a very clear meaning. Pretty much the whole CD is politcally centered, but you have to read the lyrics of some of the songs to find it. Heres a little break down:<BR>Chic'N&quot;Stu - Great opener, strong lyrics if you can understand them<BR>Innervision - nothing needs said here, just wow<BR>Bubbles - great, very politically centered song. <BR>Boom - Steal This Album's 'Deer Dance', almost as good as Deer Dance too!<BR>Nuguns - have we payed penance for the Nuguns?<BR>A.D.D. (American Dream Disorder) - pretty much a song with great drumming based around the idea of the government hiding behind a flag trying to mind control its people<BR>Mr. Jack - possible the best song on the cd, a nice slow down, the first real break in the CD<BR>I-E-A-I-A-I-O - If you take the time to listen to the song several times and catch the lyrics, which are real english, you will see this is one very political song, but the chorus is very iteresting anyway...<BR>36 - great quick song, just dont understand why its called 36 when its 46 seconds long.... anyway, anti-media for these 46 seconds.<BR>Pictures - Serj goes crazy with vocals yet again, making some great sounds, guitar great as well. Itll probably take some time for new listeners to figure out the point of this song<BR>Highway Song - starts to introduce the listener into the slower last half of the CD. great lyrics, amazing intrumentals<BR>F*** the System - Abbie Hoffman's (may he RIP) Steal This Book in a nutshell. Listen carefully, he isnt babbling, those are actual words (just like in IEAIAIO)<BR>Ego Brain - Now the CD really slows down, its amazing to see the variety SOAD can put into their songs. More into the album as a whole, and great political message in the lyrics<BR>Thetawaves - dont know why some people consider this a build up for roulette. Great song on its own. amazing instrumentals, and a yet again, great vocals. <BR>Roulette - Acoustic guitar in metal? sounds strangely amazing. Can sound a little garage band when they get singing together in the chorus, but other than that, a very great song<BR>Streamline - Great song, but could have been better placed on the albumn. The album should have finished with roulette, but, this song would probably be better placed right after F*** the System<br />SOAD, I salute you, couldn't have been better (unless marmalade was on this CD). Im surprised to find an album these days with more than 12 songs that still holds together as an album. I am very anxious to see what comes next!
B00004ZAV3|5.0|The soundtrack of the sixties,all on 1 cd.A earlier reviewer sites &quot;From me to you&quot; as being the weakest song on the album.. then how come it held down the number 1 spot for 7 straight weeks on the British charts in the early/mid 1963?
B00000099Y|5.0|Wow. 4 1/2 is not good. This is a great cd with very good tracks. Its like poetry in music something pretty rare these days. Guitar riffs are very catchy. I like all songs even the so called &quot;filler&quot; ones. If you like tool sound off here!
B00005JLKB|5.0|smallville is the ultimate dvd to have in any collection.
0385504209|3.0|About half-way through this book I began to regret the purchase. Dan Brown is overcome by his 'research' and the story never really gels. When an untrained person like me can decipher the anagrams faster than the characters who are experts, there is something very wrong.  Brown doesn't sell the romance angle at all. Finally, he tries to un-do his shots at The Vatican and The Priory with a few apologetic sentences toward the end. With all the hokey rose symbolism rampant throughout the book, I felt surely the culprit would turn out to be Pete Rose.
B000002UDG|4.0|Truth be known, I was actually looking for &quot;Wings Greatest&quot;, which is full of good songs, but out of print. However, &quot;All The Best&quot; includes 10 of the 12 tracks on &quot;Wings Greatest&quot;, plus 7 more songs from &quot;Sir Paul&quot;. So basically, this IS the best of &quot;Wings&quot;, but also has the hits &quot;Ebony And Ivory&quot;, &quot;Listen To What The Man Said&quot;, &quot;Say Say Say&quot;, and more. It's true this is missing a track or two, but great songs like &quot;Band On The Run&quot; and &quot;Another Day&quot; more than make up for it. I also really like &quot;Uncle Albert/Admiral Halsey&quot;. Overall, if you're looking for the best of &quot;Wings/McCartney&quot;, and don't want the 2-disc &quot;Wingspan (hits and history)&quot; collection, this really is &quot;All The Best&quot;.
B00006G8HX|3.0|&quot;Star Trek: The Search for Spock&quot; came in the middle of the golden era of Star Trek films (1979-86, when &quot;Star Trek&quot; ruled at the box office and got critical raves), and it's a fairly well made entry in the long series.  Comparisons between it and its immediate predecessor &quot;The Wrath of Khan&quot; are inevitable- perhaps this is why many fans were disappointed with this entry, because it fails to live up to &quot;The Wrath of Khan&quot; and has many flaws.  However, I have still allowed it into my DVD collection, and there's plenty here for a &quot;Star Trek&quot; fan to like.<br />&quot;The Search for Spock&quot;'s biggest flaw is in its pacing.  The first half hour of the film is very slow and not very interesting, as Kirk debates with others about Vulcan mythology and the current status of Spock's soul.  Hard-core fans will undoubtedly love this stuff, but as a more casual fan I wasn't very excited with it.  Likewise, the movie's final 20 minutes also are very slow and ponderous, with the final scene (I won't give it away) being the only highlight.<br />This pacing problem is a shame, because the film's middle hour is almost on the same caliber as &quot;The Wrath of Khan&quot; was.  There are many tense and involving scenes as the Enterprise flees from a hostile Starfleet and battles evil Klingons on the Genesis planet.<br />Just like the last film, William Shatner's work as Kirk here is very good- he's effective at portraying Kirk's anguish over the loss of Spock, and then his resolve to save his friend no matter what.  Leonard Nimoy's direction is pretty good considering that this was his first major film, and the &quot;Star Trek&quot; regulars show great ease with their roles here.  Christopher Lloyd isn't as good as Richardo Montalban was, but is still effectively menacing as the Klingon Commander.  Merritt Buttrick is improved as Kirk's son, and makes us care about his fate.  Only Robin Curtis as Saavick is horribly miscast- she fails to make us care about her character at all.<br />In conclusion, &quot;The Search for Spock&quot; is an adequate &quot;Star Trek&quot; adventure that will surely please fans, though casual sci-fi fans may not like it as much.  I'd recommend it to anyone who's building a &quot;Star Trek&quot; collection.

0440237688|5.0|Thank you Amazon for recommending this book as I never heard of it.  I read it one sitting and wanted more at the end!<br />The book is a combination of Brave New World and Logan's Run.  People live in a community where everyone is happy and conditioned from birth.

B00005T5YK|5.0|This multichannel DVD-A sounds wonderful.  I listened to it over and over, each time picking up something I hadn't heard before.  Already a classic album, this format lets you crawl inside the music and explore it as if you'd never heard it before.  Get this treat for your multichannel system and your ears will thank you.
0060528737|5.0|Very well written!!  I could not even put it down!!!  It was truly worth my time.
B0000B1OFL|1.0|Either I've overdosed on Hollywood's feverish cannibalism of its past glories or this is just basically a lousy movie. With Mark Wahlberg in the cast, I should have been warned. He contributed mightily to the destruction of the &quot;Planet of the Apes&quot; movie franchise. In this one, he plays his usual cocky, smirking self. Why these movie makers decided to remake an okay action flick from the 70s is a mystery. You'd think that with so many countless movie majors and movie buffs and aspiring screenwriters desperate to see their work on screen, movie moguls would give them a chance--instead of feasting voraciously on past glories. I'm preparing to watch yet another remake--&quot;Texas Chainsaw Massacre&quot;--and I really really hope I'm going to like it because it will have to be damned good to surpass the l973 original. Advice to Mark Wahlberg: stop signing on to remake junk. Get a new agent. Do something fresh and act like you really enjoy what you're doing.
B0000C6E4D|1.0|This is Sarah's worst album. I don't know what happened to her. All the melodies are so boring. Her best album was &quot;Fumbling Towards Ecstasy&quot; by far. And &quot;Surfacing&quot; was okay. Don't buy this CD - it's way too mellow and the songs are really poor!
B00005JLKB|4.0|Now the only problem I really have with smallville is that you pretty much know where it all leads in the end.  Like we all know what eventually happens between Lex and Clark which is semi annoying now seeing as how Lex is such a likeable character in smallville.<br />The cast is great.  Tom Welling makes a perfect Clark Kent.  Kristen Kruek as clark's love intrest is also good although at times her acting is a bit flat.  Then a few minor roles are clarks pals pete and chloe.  But I think the stand out actor here is Michael Rosenbaum who plays Lex Luthor.  It's just hard to beleive that he turns into clark's arch enemy in the future. <br />As for the DVD Set it's pretty basic really.  Some nice extra's but nothing that amazing other than the actual eps.  Of the 13 only 1 episode stands out as being bad, the rest are all quite good.
6301966562|5.0|Since when does a movie have to be flawless to be fully enjoyed.<BR>Sometimes I don't want to think very hard when I'm watching a film. I just want to be entertained, and after all, that's what it's all about isn't it? Electric Dreams (1984) is one of those films that gives you hope for the world. It proves there is sharing and selflessness. Granted, the acting is average, the plot couldn't possibly happen, or could it? That's the beauty of movies! Miles harding is a caring architect who falls for his new neighbor Madeline. Miles is also forgetful and often late for work. So he buys a PC to wake him up and keep him on time. After a freak liquid style accident, his PC begins to have an interest in the same girl? &quot;WHY IN THE WORLD ISN'T ELECTRIC DREAMS AVAILABLE ON DVD?!&quot; If you like the 80's and it's music and just want to be entertained with a magical love story - rent it! I'd say &quot;buy it&quot; but the studio price is still $79.99! The soundtrack alone will give you goosebumps with unreleased gems from Culture Club, Jeff Lynne of ELO, Heaven 17 and Phil Oakey from Human League. I don't know who's holding out but this baby will be sopped up with a biscuit if it hits store shelves in the normal $19-$25 range. Oh, and MGM...? Give us some nice extras on the disc like recent interviews with Lenny VonDohlen and Virginia Madsen, and some long lost outtakes/bloopers and perhaps a &quot;making of&quot; featurette. Oh and present it in widescreen with all those cool audio number ratios! Am I asking too much? I think not. Have you seen some of the movies that have been released to DVD? &quot;Not Worthy!&quot; Get this baby to Amazon.com quick! Cuz you're all just a click away from my $24.99!!! If 200,000 people buy it, that's a cool FIVE MILLION DOLLARS FOR MGM! Yes, FIVE MILLION DOLLARS! Of course more than that will sell. Go to Electric Dreams/DVD and log your e-mail for notification of release. God Bless the 80's! Scotty G.
B00005JKN9|4.0|Gangs of New York is a type of historical movie that does not come about very often. Typically, Hollywood movies tend to idealize America's past (Far And Away, Stagecoach, etc). Gangs of New York presents a very accurate (although unpopular) and unflinching view of New York in the late 1800s.<br />If one watches the History Channel, you'd find that America's large cities were extremely primitive in terms of law and order. Violent outbursts were common, police were corrupt, prostitution and drug abuse was widespread, and the city itself was simply disgusting. <br />So, naturally the only way to portray this pathetic existance is through violence. I have heard a lot of criticism on this subject, but I feel that if the violence portrayed in the film was not disturbing (and due to moviegoer's desentization towards violence, this movie had to be very disturbing indeed) the main point of the movie would not be converyd in an convining manner. Remember- NYC at the time was not a nice or safe place to live, so why should the film try to be?<br />Technically, the film is a mixed bag. The film itself is on two dual-layered DVDs. The video is a rock-solid 2.35:1 anamorphic marvel, with excellent sharpness, detail, and color. Unfortunately, the sound does not fair as well. Aside from some excellent LFE and surround effects at the end, the soundstage is generally restricted to the front three channels. At the least, the dialogue is easy to hear. I didn't notice a huge difference between the Dolby and DTS tracks, so those without DTS recievers won't be missing anything spectacular here.
0440238609|5.0|i don't read sci-fi.  i don't read lord of the rings, nor have i finished the first harry potter book.  i first picked up 'the golden compass' with strong reccommendations from a good friend of mine.  i was reluctant at first, but within the first fifteen pages i was swept up and intrigued by this psuedo-historical fantasy setting.  it's not fantasy.  it's as if one took reality and moved it an inch to the right.  perfect and beautiful.  never before have i so eagerly anticipated the release of a trilogy.  am forever a devoted fan of the 'his dark materials' trilogy.  gorgeous, romantic, and nostalgic somehow.  good god.

B0000AQS0F|5.0|One of the best science fiction television shows since the original series of Star Trek, Firefly is an enigmatic tale of a cowboy like crew in post-war (post-earth) human existence.  There are no creepy aliens that change like bad girls' underwear.  There are no aging actors coming back again and again and taking up all the time in bad dialogue.  Joss Whedon created something wholly different from Buffy &amp; Angel.  FOX canceled the series in their ignorance.

B0000CABBW|5.0|This is not necessarily a &quot;girl power&quot; movie. (That's like saying &quot;Lawrence of Arabia&quot; is a &quot;boy power&quot; movie.) &quot;Girl power&quot; is a corny term. And this is no corny movie. Simply stated, this is a movie about a person who is, at birth, unwanted; who is told &quot;no, you can't do that&quot;; who is mocked and cajoled; but who nonetheless is loved and, through her own drive and compassion, takes on the role of a leader. Anyone can relate to this movie. Yes, it might have an almost unbelievable moment or two near the end, but if your disbelief is even just a little bit suspended, you won't have a problem with it. In fact, you'll be mesmerized. To disagree somewhat with another review, this IS a polished gem -- a near perfect movie. (It just doesn't have the special effects of gadgetry of many Hollywood films. But who needs that, anyway?) A word of advice: You can skip the deleted scenes on the DVD. They don't add much and, if anything, might alter your opinion of one of the characters. The &quot;making of&quot; portions of the DVD are interesting. But again, you can easily miss them -- helping you retain the magic of the movie as a whole.

B00005J6SZ|4.0|Not one of my favourite Madonna albums, HOWEVER, it contains some absolute classics. (as would be expected - this is the album that truly introduced Madonna to the world and created the `Wannabes').<br />As this is a remastered version of the original release of LAV, it does NOT include Into The Groove, which is a shame.  However, most people who want it will have that on The Immaculate Collection.<BR>With 4 huge hits (Material Girl, Like a Virgin, Dress You Up and Angel) some classic Madonna album cuts, Over and Over (later to be remixed on You Can Dance), Stay and a cover of the Rose Royce classic `Love Don't Live Here Anymore' (which was remixed and released as a single many years later to support the `Something to Remember' ballads collection), and the truly beautiful (and still one of Madonna fans most loved ballads) Shoo-Bee-Doo.<br />The remixes are good, essentially extended versions (as the 80's did best!)<br />A classic and historical album!
0451450523|5.0|Along with the rest of the civilized world, my wandering memories often lead me back to two of my favorite childhood movies, \\"The Neverending Story\\" and \\"The Last Unicorn.\\"  Practically all I could remember of the latter was some skull yelling \\"Unicorn! Uuuunicorn!\\"  That image and that voice have left a lingering discomfort in the back of my mind for years.  A while back, I found a little time to investigate Michael Ende's novel, \\"The Neverending Story,\\" and just recently, I managed to come across a copy of \\"The Last Unicorn,\\" and I couldn't help but read it.  In both cases, these novels have more than repayed my childhood memories, giving my adult mind philosophical and literary substance as well as real joy.  Peter S. Beagle's 1968 novel, \\"The Last Unicorn,\\" is much more than a simple fantasy story - though it is rife with magicians, mythical creatures, and all of the customary trappings.  It is even more than a complex fantasy story - somehow Beagle enchants us into a timeless place where nothing seems unusual - \\"The Last Unicorn\\" creates a space for magic in our modern lives.  <br />The novel begins as a unicorn overhears two hunters riding through her wood - the hunters debate whether unicorns exist anymore.  The unicorn begins to wonder if indeed she is the last of her kind, and goes in search of other unicorns.  She is caught sleeping by Mommy Fortuna, owner of the Midnight Carnival, who displays the unicorn for a time alongside a real harpy and a motley bunch of meek, hopeless animals who are made, through Fortuna's magic, to resemble other dangerous mythical beasts for the entertainment of travellers, tourists, and townsfolk.  Schmendrick, a fairly useless magician, and an assistant to the Midnight Carnival, recognizes the unicorn for what she is, and freeing her, they set off together to find the unicorns.  Once they are joined by a woodland dweller named Molly Grue, the company is complete. Their search brings them to the domain of King Haggard, who, along with the demoniacal, but eerily incorporeal Red Bull, seems to have something to do with the disappearance of the unicorns.<br />Though the novel is a quest, there isn't much real movement - the novel moves from the unicorn's wood, over land to Haggard's castle by the sea, which is where almost half of the novel takes place.  The more significant quests here are ones of self-discovery, as the unicorn, Schmendrick, and Prince Lir, King Haggard's heir, must all try to figure out who they are, what they want to be, and how to accomplish their goals without being consumed by existential despair.  Related questions the novel poses include speculations on the nature of the hero, on the metafictional nature of the fairy tale as a genre, and what the difference is between evil and self-interest, between love and hatred.  \\"The Last Unicorn\\" is also a rumination on the nature of interpersonal (or interspecies) relationships, and is in spots as concerned with ecology and the environment as J.R.R. Tolkien's \\"Lord of the Rings.\\"  <br />However, far and away, the most compelling facets of \\"The Last Unicorn\\" for me are Beagle's minor touches, minutiae that some people might miss on a first reading.  Seemingly meaningless conversations, like the one between the hunters which begins the novel, between Captain Cully and his disaffected latter-day Robin Hoods in the forest, or between a 'married' pair of blue jays betray a depth and attention to detail and a real artistry in Beagle's literary workmanship.  They alert us, as certainly as Tolkien's work does, to the fact that we, the novel's readers, live in a prosaic world, divested of magic and enchantments.  Beagle's novel shows that creating, living in, and sustaining a fantasy world can be as much work, and can involve as much pain as our own normal daily lives.  Indeed, one amazing quality of \\"The Last Unicorn\\" is that it hardly differentiates between the normal modern world and that of the fairy tale.  One reviewer mentions that the novel takes place in the Middle Ages - is it at all astonishing then, to hear Cully at one point mention the \\"field-recordings\\" that will one day be made of his oral poetry while he himself eats a taco?  <br />\\"The Last Unicorn\\" has endured for almost 40 years because it manages to imbue things like \\"field-recordings\\" with a kind of magical quality that seems as natural as talking birds and butterflies.  Beagle also reminds us that we are each heroes of our own stories - whether we stick to the literary conventions of genre or not.  The inclusion of subtle anachronisms and metafictional commentaries like these clues us to Beagle's art - the creation of a new kind of fairy tale, one which attempts to make our own world, our own lives, sources of almost limitless wonder and joy, as well as of continuing epic challenges.
B00005JMJ4|5.0|I just loved this movie. If you a real movie lover, you will love it too! The story itself is so simple but at the same time is so complex , at least for the people who are experiencing it. If you have been abroad for quite a long time you MUST see it, Im sure it will put you to think about your own experiences.
0767812166|4.0|OK it's very obviously 80s at some points, but you have to ignore that. I've loved this movie since I was young, and I was quite surprised to find the DVD with extras (which isn't listed on Amazon for some reason). OK, they're not terrific extras - you get for your money, a trailer for Starman (hardly a trailer, there are NO clips of the actual movie - explain that one!), a trailer for Close Encounters Of The Third Kind, Making Of &quot;Starman&quot; featurette, the feature length commentary, and the terrific &quot;All I Have To Do Is Dream&quot; music video, sung by Karen Allen &amp; Jeff Bridges. I loved this video, and as I originally loved the song, even though I'm not old enough to actually remember when it was out, I thought it was well sung, by both. Jeff has a really distinctive voice when it sings - and there's also a rather tender kiss towards the end! (No tongues)<br />It's your typical storyline really, nothing new - girl meets boy, girl hates boy, girl falls in love. How often has that been done? (I've even done it myself!)<br />The chemistry between Jeff &amp; Karen is terrific, and both act the part well - especially Jeff, an alien who doesn't really understand English, and is hilarious in the process - watch out for the scene where he follows Karen into the ladies!<br />It's quite sad at points, as they gradually get to know each other, in the short space of time, or the fact that Jeff feels what the body feels. The ending is nearly one for the tissues.<br />The themes used during the film are fantastic - the tune will be going round and round in your head for ages, so much so that it will drive you crazy when you're trying to sleep.<br />This is a terrific film, definitely worth a special edition in a few years.
B00005J6T0|5.0|This the point where Madonna became critically acclaimed, and it is still a stand out album.  It sold by the bucket loads, and whilst the album only comes with 9 tracks (+ the 2 added remixes on this remastered version), its not hard to see why.<br />Packed with hits such as: Papa don't preach, Open your heart, Live to tell, La Isla Bonita, and True blue, and fan favourites, Love makes the world go round and Where's the party, this album is like a trip down memory lane.  <BR>The best remix here is for La Isla, which uses the gorgeous backing vocals to full effect, and is basicaly an extended version.
B000002H2H|4.0|This is a great album no doubt. The call of ktulu is musically one of the best metal song I have ever heard. fade to black is an absolute classic. maybe missing a little balls though in this one.
6301954947|5.0|This is a superb movie which I was able to obtain as a used VHS on Eb*y. The battle scenes are unforgettable. Christopher Plummer brings Wellington to life, Rod Steiger is an excellent Napoleon, especially compared to the recent unintentionally comic Napoleon of Christian Clavier.<br />It is not available on DVD and is OOP on VHS in America. Amazing when you think of all the unwatchable trash that is available complete with documentaries and multiple commentary tracks. <br />A previous reviewer suggest buying a copy from Amazon.co.uk. I did just that last summer and the DVD arrived surprisingly fast all the way from England. Unfortunately, not only as it region 2, which can be defeated relatively easily, but it also recorded in PAL, the &quot;other&quot; home video standard that is completely incompatible with the NTSC televisons and DVD players that are used in the U.S. There are specialty DVD players that will read both PAL and NTSC DVDs and output a NTSC video signal as well as other much more complicated ways of watching PAL DVDs (buying a PAL DVD player and a PAL television for example) but it is hardly worth spending hundreds of dollars to do so just to watch a few sought after but locally unavailable movies.
B0000069NM|5.0|...including everything else, yeah, it's that good.
B0000DZEE3|5.0|a well-deserved 5 star performance DVD. Camera, visuals, artistic elements and navigation... and the entire concert was wonderful. to put it simply, you get a clear depiction of what artistry and musicianship is all about.
B000002H97|3.0|This album is for those who couldn't handle the early stuff. If you like pop metal then this is the album for you. sure there are some really great songs on this album but what happened to the hardened men of metal? its like metallica almost lost a little soul on this one. good songs are 'sad but true' and 'dont tread on me'. 'Nothing Else Matters' is a song that proves my first point...pop metal.
B000002H70|5.0|The Cure is one of those bands you grow passionate about. And this is of those albums kids name-drop just to say they have credibility.  Just listening to one Cure song isnt enough, because you couldn't understand what The Cure is all about in one song.Disintegration...listening to this album is like taking a trip down memory lane on a grey evening, remembering more than you want to about the sadness in your life. But it seems to be ok, if this is the soundtrack. And I truly believe that is what Robert Smith wanted to accomplish, he wanted to share the same common desparity, for love, loss, whatever it may be. This album is perfectly beautiful. Its probably typical to say this, but Lovesong, is just simple beauty. Without saying much, he says it all. Genuis music laced with beautiful words. Simplicity and complexity at its best.  This isn't your \\"Close to Me\\" Cure, its the cure everyone respects and wants to be part of. And this is why I hold The Cure so highly, and as my all time fav. band.
B0000DZEA1|1.0|--<BR>Reviewer guidelines say to focus on the album content. I'd love to. I agree with most every reviewers love of Howard shore's score for the movie. It's wonderful, rich music that expanded the texture of the movie for me. I also was blown away by 'Into The West' and Annie Lennox' performance. <br />Unfortunately I can't focus on the content since the copy I pre-ordered would not play on my CD player and locked up my PC. I have since returned it as defective. What a disappointment.
0312263120|3.0|Dan Brown scored big time with &quot;The Da Vinci Code&quot;, which was well done.  The exhaust of a huge success like DVC is that the rest of the books that went nowhere come out of the woodwork and into the mainstream. <br />Mr. Brown must have spent a lot of time in his youth figuring out crosswords, WHATZITS, word search, trivia, etc...  As all of his characters thus far (may be unfair to say, as I have only read this book and DVC) have been 'de-coder fanatics.'  Digital Fortress is no exception.  <br />Once you get passed the implausibility of the technical aspects of the story you can focus on the plot, which isn't bad.  Though I would be remiss if I didn't say the plot is far less complicated than the puzzles within the story. I literally figured out the plot 1/3 through.  <br />Therfore I must label &quot;Digital Fortress&quot; predictable, but readable.  A decent effort.
B000002H33|5.0|Forget about the other albums, if you want a real metallica metallica album then this is the one.  Ok the songs are about a year long but that is what makes metallica so great, they can do it without boring your pants off. This album is a true classic.  best songs are master of puppets and damage inc. trust me this is true blue metallica.
B00009V7PJ|4.0|I love me some cher!!!  AY AY Rod just except it man.. there is no jealousy here! atleast on my part. Overshadowing thats in your head. I admit Madonna is perfect in many things, But has made it and ART! even when she NOT perfect.  WHO CARES whos been out longer or whatever, A proven fact is and for the last time ill say it. What chers has done in 40 years, YOU say should listen to cher I see only DRAG QUEEN'S have. Madonna has done it all in 10 years and continues on she may NOT BE PERFECT! so tell me why has madonna sold more 160 million albums alone still  counting. and 88 million singles alone World wide? (from a source at WB) Now thats a DIVA, You cannot answer that can you ? Madonna's success is what MOST female artist today, even the 1 or 2 hit wonders, even males artist have been compared, has hoped or dreamed to REPLICATE Madonna music charts/sales and of course to remain as powerfull at what she does, And theres more to come from madonna. Thats why CHER is launching this Farewell tour cause Cher knows it herself madonna does it better. So there no jealousy here. its all true facts, thats all and you know it. love ya..
0060934913|5.0|I like eating food, not cooking so I wasn't sure about this book. But all of his shows are very interesting so I took a chance.<BR>This is an incredibly good book. There isn't a single page that bored me. It read pretty fast and was a lot of fun. He talks about himself, his childhood, his college years, his cooking years, and everything &amp; everyone inbetween. It was a fantastic book &amp; i'd highly recommend it.
B0000AUHOH|5.0|It is very funny: the best DVD release for a \\"Star Trek\\" movie since \\"The Motion Picture\\" has been given to the worst of the films: \\"Star Trek V - The Final Frontier.\\" The movie has some good moments (outside of the search for God and the mediocre visual effects), and the DVD has some awesome special features to enjoy. I recommend the DVD just for the extras alone!<br />Movie Grade: C+ (3 Stars)<br />DVD Grade: A+ (5 Stars)
B000099T3P|1.0|The first and the second are fun, the last two kind of went off course.  These days paying $16.99+ for these type of movies is unacceptable.  Unless its offered in a 4 pack, I wouldnt waste my money on ANY of these movies, unless they drop the price to $9.99 each.  In that case, buy the first two.<br />NO SPECIAL FEATURES.  Wait for the 4 pack.
B0000020C4|5.0|It's the finest group of Les Mis actors playing the roles in this once-in-a-lifetime event (special mention goes to Ms. Lea Salonga, the perfect Eponine).  If your money allows you to buy only one Les Mis recording, get this one.  This is the best!
B0000DYJM6|5.0|This album is, rest assured, one of the best they have put out to date. I love the way the album takes me back in time and brings me to the same place I was when I was listening to them when I was 12 years old. Your crazy if you don't pick this one up!
B0000CDLA7|4.0|I have only recently just gotten into Dream Theater, so my opinion may not mean much. Though I do believe this is a good CD in its own right.  But it is much different than other releases by this band. It is indeed much heavier and the lyrics aren't as smart as they used to be (No offense to anyone) though lyrics were never their strong point.  It is their instrumentation and technical ability. Something I believe they do well on this CD. The main thing is, that its different from other release, to me this is a good way to prevent becoming stale in their sound.<BR>  So I believe if you already like Dream Theater and you want a harder edge, get it.
B00005JMJ5|5.0|During the first 30 minutes or so I was enjoying the film but not sure how they got so many fine actors to sign on to the piece. As the plot progressed, though, I was further drawn into the movie. Hopkins does a tremendous job in his role and proves his prowess as an actor yet again. The directing and editing are teriffic and the film as a whole interprets you more than you are able to interpret it. Highly recommended!
B00000K3G8|4.0|What is Talking Heads influence on modern music? Their synth squiggles and African percussion and nervous energy hasn't been seen much since 1988. Talking Heads were more creative and more popular than the hallowed Ramones, and yet while everyone in music is off trying to combine the Ramones' three chord madness with the Cars less synthy moments, Talking Heads have been left out of the New Wave craze.<br />Almost every arty hipster in Manhattan can tell you that they love Talking Heads, hell if David Byrne wasn't such a weirdo he would probably be another Lou Reed type father figure to bands rockin' the Bowery. But its prehaps better this way, because anyone who really understood and loved Talking Heads would never immitate them.<br />This is because Talking Heads' mark on pop history extends well past their wonderful music, they proved to the world that strange, arty music could be as thought provoking as it was dancable. Really carrying on the tradition of Bowie's Ziggy Stardust, Talking Heads made music that was arty but not psychadelic or ambient or even white. Now, the Rolling Stones had taken on blues along with the rest of the punk movement, but Talking Heads dared to go past &quot;black music&quot; history and instead they used a heavy dose of urban funk and soul.<br />From 1976 to 1984 Talking Heads seemlessly made their way from being a quirky minimalist band to being a Fela Kuti inspired funk/high-life band untill settling on full fledged funk, while never missing a step or losing their core identity. And thank you Jesus, its all here on this disk!<br />Stop Making Sense is better than any 'best of' that has been or ever will be released. This is the best American band of the 80's in their absolute prime, and this disk is essencial for both the beggining listner and the seasoned fan, as the old version was incomplete and had only a fraction of the tracks found here. Here the listner is presented with all of the faces of the Talking Heads, from Manhattan New Wave, to Mott Haven funk, to Nigerian high-life, all are worth listening to and all should be appreciated.<br />The only reason why this review gives this album 4 stars is a reminder that nothing is substitute for the albums, while highly recomended, for those of you who have never heard the albums in their entirety, use this as a starting point, and go from there.
B00005JMTN|5.0|If you have ever wondered what post-modernism is, go watch this movie. As the movie progresses the son slowly begins to understand that what makes something real is not it's historicity (whether or not it really happened). Reality is rather formed by the stories that the father tells his son. Excellent story and worthy of your time and money!
B000002KZ6|4.0|Talking Heads, the seminal mainstream art band of the 1980's find American funk in its fullest form. David Byrne once said that Speaking in Tongues was an opportunity to make music similar to Remain in Light, but to make it less dense. Well he did accomplish that in a way, except the music contains more Parliament then Fela Kuti, the synths here are much more noticible and the music once again centers itself around Chris Franz heavy 4/4 drumming and uses the complex African percussion as more of an effect than an actual way to keep rythm. This made Speaking in Tongues their pop breakthrough, and their first slip up.<br />The abscence of long time producer, and virtual fifth member takes its toll here, and with the new technology the electronics became shaper, more varying and as a result they lost the organic sound achieved on their Eno assisted albums, especially Remain in Light. Gone are the harsh griding sound of &quot;Life During Wartime&quot;, and in are the George Clintonesque colorful synth squiggles of &quot;Girlfriend is Better&quot;. And thats not the last of George Clinton here, just listen to &quot;Making Flippy Floppy&quot; and then listen to &quot;One Nation Under a Groove&quot; from Clinton's mega-band Funkadelic.<br />But here the Talking Heads lose their edge, they do manage to make their brand of funk unique to them, but here is where their influences outweigh their own unique contributions, its not by mutch but compared to the unique dance mausic they ceated on Remain in Light, this just seems weak, for any other band this album would probably have been their best, but for the Talking Heads it is their first less than brilliant release. But for first time or inexperienced listner, this is a good album to get after Stop Making Sence because it happy and pop oriented, but still contains the much of the inventiveness of earlier releases, plus it has &quot;Burning Down the House&quot; which is the most popular and well known Talking Heads song.<br />The problem I have with this version of the album is that it unfortunatly is simply a copy from the tapes used to record the original material. It hasn't been digitally remastered, and the complete absence of bonus material is a major downside. It is such a mystery to me why the Talking Heads catalogue has been treated so poorly by record companies, but for now its the best we're gonna get.
B0000C9JFO|5.0|I really don't have much to say besides that.  I've been to Barcelona, and the movie made me want to go back and live there as Xavier had.  It was just an enjoyable movie to watch and fall in love with.
B0000DJZA5|3.0|Certainly listenable, but I'm not sure it's as good as the original. I'm a big Beatles fan, but I also enjoy Phil Spector, and frankly, I've always thought he got a bad rap about this album.  (Apparently, John felt this way, too, as Spector produced a Lennon solo album after this one.)<br />It's pretty in a very different way from the first release, but do you need to own both of them?
B000070IXT|4.0|Rented the DVD and loooooved it, not knowing ANYTHING about the game (hey, i'm a 47-yo lady...okayyyyyy???) :-P  Only wish I'd seen it on the BIG silver screen, cuz I know it was awesome!  Now I'm on pins &amp; needles waiting 4 the sequel, and will definitely see it on the BIG screen!  I loved the action, the zombies, the hi-tech gadgetry, all that stuff.  I highly recommend it 2 any sci-fi/horror fans.<br />If any1 already has the Superbilt version, willya let me know if it's worth it?  Just would like a bit more info b4 I buy it.<br />Thanks!
B00004RD54|5.0|i first heard this album (vinyl) when it first came out and memorized every note......after loss of the lp i finally replaced it with this new cd.......man, am i glad i did.......it was a hugh rush then and it blows me away still........there is nothing like these lyrics backed by this band that is short of rock and roll nirvana.......it makes me feel 23 again........don't over-think this whole thing, just buy the cd.......you won't be sorry.......thanks for listening
0380789019|5.0|I originally became involved in Neil Gaiman's fantastical, deeply provoking writings because of a friend, who was completely obsessed with his &quot;Sandman&quot; series, and his work with Terry Pratchett on &quot;Good Omens&quot;.  This was the first solo Neil Gaiman novel I read, and might (possibly) remain my favorite to date.  (But then again, how can one choose?)  Quite simply put, it is a masterwork of dark, &quot;urban&quot; fantasy, in a world with so many mysterious layers that to read it again and again is like peeling the skins off of a never-ending onion: you see a new layer each time.<br />The three primary complaints I've heard about this book is: 1.) It is too morbid and dark.  2.) The characters are never fully developed, and so many are mentioned just &quot;in passing&quot; for no apparent reason.  3.) Gaiman can't get his &quot;point&quot; across.  To be fully prepared for this book, you have to realize three points:  Yes, it is very morbid and dark, but in such a fascinating, occasionally humourous way that it does not make you revile it.  Be prepared for some seriously disturbing imagery, but this only adds to the story.  Secondly, the characters are indeed deeply developed, but do not go in expecting your usual &quot;bad guy&quot; vs. &quot;good guy&quot; arrangement.  The main character, Richard is above all (and here is Gaiman's most brilliant stroke), only a human, with weaknesses and strengths that are so realistic that you feel you know Richard like your best friend.  By far the most realistic &quot;human&quot; portrayal I've ever read, and that's saying something!   Also, all the characters have their &quot;dark&quot; and &quot;light&quot; sides.  The nature of humans everywhere remains the same.  The many characters mentioned only in passing stir up curiousity and a feeling that the world of London Below goes much deeper than just what Mr. Gaiman reveals to us, something that is &quot;passing rare and wonderous&quot; in a book these days.<br />So, you think Gaiman can't get his &quot;point&quot; across, eh?  Well, be prepared for a book in which the author is not TRYING to get a &quot;point&quot; across, thank God.   He's not trying to instill you with his own morals, or a sense of &quot;justice&quot; or make the world seem &quot;black and white&quot;.  For once, (and this is deeply refreshing indeed), a writer is telling a novel not as an allegory, not to inspire great deeds of heroism, but for the simple sake that his head would most likely explode out of sheer creative energy if he didn't.  For the pleasure of telling a tale.  This is not a book that you will put down, determined to good in the world.  This a book you will never put down at all, for once you have read it inevitably images and scenes will spring into your mind at the slightest provocation.  Neil Gaiman is the Salvador Dali of fiction, taking our own world and twisting and shaping and molding it into such a darkly beautiful thing it will haunt you for the rest of your life.   The only things I can compare it to are not other works of fiction, but other works of art entirely: the paintings of Salvador Dali.  The music of Blue Man Group.  The performances and costumes of the Cirque du Soleil.   A brilliant canvas of a novel to inspire and delight readers of all ages, and to come back to every time you feel the need for a little shadow in your life.
B000005YZM|5.0|I am a Brit-Pop / J-Pop fan to the hilt.  My choice for best album ever is Odessey &amp; Oracle.  Better than any single Beatles album, better than Straight Up by Badfinger (their best), better than the Who's concept albums...  You know, its been said in all the other reviews - This is a great album.  Unless, that is, you think Metallica invented music.
0345446798|3.0|I thought that the author provided some useful insight into relationships between dogs and owners, but felt like I was weeding through all of her personal stories in order to get to the info I wanted. I also could have done without having to read example after example of how other species behave similarly or differently from dogs and humans.
B000002UJQ|5.0|I agree with one of the other reviewers in that \\"OK Computer\\" is now getting what all other brilliant albums eventually get--unfair criticisms and accusations of trying to be something it's not. It's happened with almost every revered band or artist out there from The Beatles to Nirvana and definitely on to Radiohead. It just seems that once an album has been critically acclaimed for a few years that it is open ground for random people and other critics to start dissecting it, so that they can be the first to snatch it from it's proverbial pedestal. Why I don't understand is, why?? Why must equally emotional, thoughtful, and beautiful music like Radiohead be subjected to this mindless torture? Why can't we just appreciate it, for god's sake? Is nothing sacred in the world of music?<br />Everyone is entitled to their own opinion, of course, but liking this album does not mean that you are a poser. And not liking it doesn't make you some musical genuis with a revelation. Personally, what is not to like? I didn't need to listen to this album more than once to absolutely make it one of my absolute favorites. I have always been a fan of Thom Yorke's anguished voice and the way the music just somehow takes you to another place. I think this CD definitely has some of the best background instrumentals I have ever heard. Everything just fits together. I can say one thing...\\"OK Computer\\" is in my player now and it has been for months.
B0000C9JFO|5.0|...you prudes who worry about the lead character's supposed lack of scruples. This is a delightful comedy about living abroad and learning about yourself and others. Anyone who has had the experience will recognize some small part of their own growth.
B000002BBY|5.0|&quot;...Morning Glory&quot; has consistently been one of my all-time favorite albums due the fact that it is just 'perfection', to say the least. Each and every song has it's own unique identity while tying the entire album together beautifully. I can see, though, by other reviews and such that this album is beginning it's descent into negative criticisms like so many wonderful CDs have to eventually go through. I don't understand what is wrong with genuinely good music...even if it is catchy or even a so-called &quot;chewy pop confection.&quot; I think that Oasis did it right with this album, and I will continue to stand behind it. I mean, who can deny that &quot;Wonderwall&quot; was one of the best songs of the nineties? Even listening to it now, I never grow tired of Liam's pleading voice and Noel's guitar surrounding it. I wish that I could pick a favorite on the disc, but I really can't. It's just one of those albums that can make you have a new favorite everytime you give it a listen.
B0000025L0|4.0|Few mid 70's \\"jazz-funk-fusion\\" albums can be classed as \\"fun\\" but this is about as close as it gets - superbly played music that keeps its head above the murky waters of self-indulgence that too many other records from this period fall into. The stand-out title track features an insidious bass riff, superb lead guitar and a quite breathtaking two and a half minute bass break that is just about as demanding as it gets without at any point losing the importance of keeping complex playing within a tight melodic structure... simply one of the most technically brilliant and enjoyable jazz-funk recordings ever made. And, the rest of the album continues in the same vein allowing sufficient space for virtuoso playing within consistently satisfying melodic structures. The end result?: deceptively laid-back music that stands the test of time precisely because of its controlled combination of complexity and melody.
B0000AOV85|4.0|Pink Floyd's \\"Dark Side of the Moon\\" is a favorite rock album, with tracks like Breathe and Money ... this DVD is an excellent behind the scenes look at the mixing of, and alternate audio/acoustic versions of, some of the favorites from the album.
0553208845|4.0|Siddhartha is a coming of age story of sorts.  The main character Siddhartha is trying to find his way to enlightenment.  He is very smart and learns all that he can from the Brahmin(priests).  His father is a Brahmin and expects Siddhartha to follow in those steps as well.  Siddhartha sees that he has learned all that he can from the Brahmin and sets out for more knowledge.  This pattern is repeated.<br />  This book is a great introduction to Indian Religion and Buddhism.  It takes place during the years of the Buddha, and the Buddha makes an appearance in the novel as one of Siddhartha's teachers.  This journey to one man's enlightenment will make you question all you think you know and appreciate most of what you take for granted.  I can see why monks devote their whole lives to contemplating their existance.  One would have to, to understand all of the subtle nuances of eastern religions.<br />  This book will not brainwash anyone into Buddhism, if anything the complexities expressed in this novel will turn them off to Buddhism. There is no violence in this book, but there are some sexual themes.  High School age and above should enjoy reading this novel.  Parents, if you child reads this book, read it as well and discuss it with them.  This book having religious themes may raise questions.  Questions you should answer not a public school teacher.

0446310786|4.0|It was in a small town in the South, in 1930's. The story is full of interesting, lovable characters. The narrator is Scout a bright, bold, young girl who lived with her older brother Jem and their lawyer father, Atticus.<br />Respectable Atticus was a gentleman who raised the two children with the help from Calpurina, the day cook. Against some of the prevalent social senses, he taught them the principles and values he lived by. <br />With Dill around during the summer, things were more interesting. They had the hermit neighbor who remained the mysterious subject of the children's acts of curiosity. Their interaction with other neighbors like Ms Maudie and Mrs Dubose was always capped with lessons to learn.<br />And there was a case of a black man Atticus defended against the charge of raping a white girl.  Atticus' integrity and the people's classic prejudices were demonstrated in events related to the case.<br />The storyline and language are awesome. Narrations by children are always interesting in the way curiosity, frankness, and innocence do. And the book is full with values we adults could always relearn. No wonder it is such a classic!
B000089CJI|3.0|I went out and bought this album, anticipating that it would be a fantastic album.  However, I was disappointed by the actual content.  Uninspired vocals, bubble-gummy pop synth lines, and pretty sappy lyrics, this band (is it a guy and a girl?) was not exactly what I was hoping for.  The songs seem to drag on &amp; re-use material from just a couple of tracks before.  I had first heard the band on a Sundance movie trailer and thought that they sounded pretty cool and laid back - but after buying the record, it seemed that they were too laid back &amp; the mere 10 tracks were too much.  They have potential, but it isn't really being used.
B000001FI7|2.0|I can't stop laughing at the reviews that condemn this album,  because they're so darn precise to me. As I recall, one reviewer wrote, and I quote:&quot;After giving this album a few listens, I'm gonna sale this piece of junk&quot;. Had me laughing to tears for about 10 minutes. You've hit the spot, boy! However, I also laugh at all the reviewers who praise this album, for I feel pity for them. Just a bunch of trend followers who can't tell the difference between good music and, um, trends.<br />Of course there are a couple of good songs, literally speaking, referring to &quot;Roads&quot; and &quot;Glory Box&quot;, the reasons why this album got 2 stars instead of one. But as a music fan with an open mind, I've heard much better than this, such as Soulstice's &quot;Illusion&quot; just to name a solid example. As an advice to all you people reading this, don't be a dummy: download this before buying, like I did. Then you decide. Good Luck...
B000007489|5.0|This is the one that started it all folks!  These crazy angelinos not only played great hardcore punk rock on this one, but also helped invent speed/thrash metal with the blazing guitar solos they threw in!  Being a punk rock fan I realize a lot of others like me don't enjoy S.T.'s later releases, but even when they crossed over to full on metal I enjoyed that too.  Now they're in their millionth incarnation, but I honestly haven't heard much of their stuff after art of rebellion.  Hardcore Punk, thrash metal, even a little funk metal... S.T. was at all these places before or at the same time as anyone else, they are truly an influential, yet criminally underrated and overlooked band!  And this is the CLASSIC that started it all! For old school punk AND 80's thrash metal fans this one's essential!
0156027321|4.0|I am a non-religious, non-spiritual person, despite the religious theme of this book I still found it a gripping and intriguing page turner. I found the first part a little slow but the second part which made up the bulk of the novel, the story of the shipwreck and survival on the lifeboat, was absolutely fascinating. [Possible Spoiler] I did however think &quot;What the hell???&quot; when I hit the part about him coming across the other guy in another lifeboat who like Pi had also gone blind. At first I thought this must be Pi dreaming or hallucinating but when no such explanation was offered I was left wondering what is the explanation for this unbelievable coincidence (was he the French cook from the ship?). Then of course the carnivorous island was a bizarre tale but yet fascinating (like something out of the 'Twilight Zone'). The third and final part begs more questions - which story was the real one? Is the better story the 'real' one? The author does seem to be pushing that point of view with his &quot;And so it goes with God&quot; line.
1558216847|5.0|This is one of the best non-fiction books I've ever read.  It's so incredible that anyone could live through an ordeal like this.  <br />Read to know what horrors people are capable of - and what fantastic acts men can push their bodies and minds to achieve.
B000002NAK|4.0|I've watched the movie so many times over the years, so when I got the soundtrack I was a little disappointed. I understand that they had to re-record the songs for sound quality, but Madonna, Jonathan, and Antonio could have tried harder to make certain songs sound like they did on the screen. For a person who's heard the same thing over and over and expected the same thing on the soundtrack, it was very disconcerting. It pulls me out of being swept up in the marvelous orchestration and lyrics and gives me the &quot;nails on the chalkboard&quot; feeling.<br />I still recommend the soundtrack, but just be aware that it's not exactly what you're used to...
B0000C6E4D|5.0|I was glad to hear Sarah once again after her hiatus of five plus years. I sometimes buy an album for one or two songs contained within the album as I'm sure others do as well. I remember listening to Surfacing in cassette format over and over again. I really enjoyed that album. Afterglow has some real good cuts on it as did Surfacing. However, what I did especially appreciate was, on Afterglow you can listen to and really enjoy every cut on this album! Perhaps as I age (along with others of my generation)I want the entire album to be listenable. Afterglow provides this listening pleasure! I particularly enjoyed the &quot;Time&quot; cut. The tempo and wording were excellant! Good Job Sarah! Two thumbs up!
0792151712|1.0|From the very begining I cannot to see Leo drowing down into the deep frozen and blue sea. Not to mention the old lady who instead thinking of her big grandaughter welfare thrown away a million dollars necklace.And what about the lack of respect of Leo and Kate running  into the engine room, playing while all those poor sailors are working hard?  If I were the car's owner where the disgusting love scene happens I will be happy that the Titanic remained under the water.<br />About Leo's paintings. NO COMMENTS.<br />Guess what music was listening Titanic's Captain before he crashed into the iceberg....,that's right!!! Celine Dion &amp; the Royal Mantovanian Orchestra!!!!!<BR>If you really like Titanic's Story, you can't miss the film with Clifton Webb, simply marvelous.
B00005QDW1|4.0|Well first things first No Doubt are one of the most successful bands around and I guess that they are rock steady but people have been comparing old and new no doubt! well get this there aint no old are new im sick saying all their old stuff is better, fair enuff i agree tragic kingdom was class and return of saturn was ok :S but im glad that when rock steady came out they offered a new range of music.

B00003CX95|2.0|What would you think if your boyfriend, on a saturday night takes you to the only mountain in Scotland (Ben Nevis), and began to speak to you in Latin? Any normal girl will leave him right there. But I do not want to be very hard . My strongest objection is that for a poor Scot, who lives in a hut, go to Rome, and speak fluently three languages is too much.<BR>William Wallace was not a poor peasant as depicted in the film. No peasant in the XIIth century could afford that culture. So if Mr. Gibson wanted to make an accurately Historic film he should have done a better research. <BR>But on the other hand we have Patrick Macgoohan. Wonderful actor who plays a real, believeable Edward . And the supproting characters are well done. But you do not need to make up History to make it appealing. The story of Wallace was good enough by itself, and romantic enough by itself.<br />Mr. Gibson shows he is a competent director for crowded scenes, not so good for intimate ones. The music is nice and costumes too. But it is a film who grows old every year.
B00003CXWV|5.0|Johnny Depp posesses an eclecticism and versatility so effortless that it's almost scary. His riveting turn as Cocaine Traffiker George Jung is one of many reasons to see this movie. The story of how he rises to the top of the drug game starting in the late 60's is told in a very clear, direct and colorful manner with great support from Ray Liotta, Paul Reubens, Franka Potente and Penelope Cruz. While the ending still seems a bit too cloying for me, nearly every frame leading up to the climax is American Cinema at it's best. Of Special Note: the costume design covering 3 decades of fashion, including the outlandish 70's is note perfect and easily adds to the texture and realism of the film without seeming cartoonish or flagrant. Give &quot;Blow&quot; a look, it's vastly entertaining.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|The Firefly DVD set is perfect. In it's short tenure, Firefly gained an enormous following of loyal fans. Fox showed a lack of faith in what could've easily been their next huge money maker akin to the success of the X-Files. They cancelled the show after less than half a season.<br />This DVD collects the 11 aired, and 3 unaired episodes, into one boxed set. The quality is excellent, and I especially appreciate the slimline cases for each DVD. It makes taking one with you easy, while keeping the overall size of the box set relatively slender. The extras, like the gag reel and Adam Baldwin's rendition of the Hero of Canton, all demonstrate how this show was loved by it's creators and participants as much as by viewers.<br />The real star of the set is the show. The unaired episodes are as good as the ones that aired, and each one makes you wish there were more. Few shows have such a magical blend of characters, from the alluring Companion, to the amoral Jayne, to the pilot who plays with dinosaurs, to the brother/sister team like a modern Laertes trying to save Ophelia. Each character brings a special charm and depth that could've been explored for many years to come. Exploring the mystery of the preacher who is not what he seems is enough to fuel Firefly for at least 3 years.<br />If you've not seen Firefly, buy the set and enjoy, but expect to be left wanting more.
B00003CXBH|5.0|for some reason this movie has recieved mainly bad reviews from critics.  i've seen it many times, and it remains one of my favorites.  it is beautiful, haunting, and powerful.  it explores the hypocrisy of the catholic church and of the colonial governments.  while the personal struggle of the priests are at the forefront, the story of the guarani remains one that is somehow both unique and universal.  it brings me to tears every time.
B00008K7AM|3.0|This is another in the series of Rob Schneider movies in which he is placed in inappropriate or impossible situations, and reacts. Consider this to be the Devil's Spawn of the 'Freaky Friday' genre. Petty thief Rob changes places with 'Jessica', the prettiest girl in school via some magical earrings, and hilarity ensues. Well, that's the theory, anyhow. Truth be told, there are some amusing and a couple of quite funny moments in the film, but overall it's pretty formulaic.<br />I have two favorite subplots.  My favorite involves Rob (well his body with Jessica inside) becoming a gardener for Jessica's father. In this ruse, he is transformed into 'Taquito', and sports a very bad Mexican accent. They go through some ritual male bonding exercises (talking about women, playing basketball, etc.) and eventually Rob is able to save his marriage by resisting having an affair with Jessica's mother, in which Rob has the best line in the entire film when he says, while brushing off her clumsy pass: \\"This is so wrong in at least five different ways.\\" I don't know why, but that really did amuse me. In the end, Rob says the right things to both parents and their love life is reborn!<br />My other favorite subplot is a bit more base, but basically involves Jessica learn to use a male body. This comes to a peak when she (in Rob's body, of course) tries to learn to use a urinal with the help of an elderly bathroom assistant. It's a very visual piece of shtick, but it was funny, in a base, teenage sort of way.<br />In the end they get the two lead characters back together and the movie's only bout of special effects gives us the Jessica to Rob pole dancing transmogrification.<br />This movie is very much a cookie cutter formula comedy, but it actually has a few moments of amusement to be seen. On balance, it's an OK way to pass the time if you don't want any heavy thinking involved, and it's WAY better than 'Corky Romano'!
B0000AUHOH|3.0|If only they would have gone with Shatner's original story treatment, where the Enterprise journeys to H-E-double-hockey-sticks and Kirk gets in a fist fight with Beelzebub, kicking ol' Scratch's horn-tailed keester, of course. Can you say camp classic, kids?
B000002H6C|5.0|Metallica made 3 masterpieces back-to-back: Ride the Lightning, Master of Puppets and ...And Justice for all.<br />The rest, with the exception of Kill'em all, is just nothing compared to these three great pieces of Metal.<br />Specially ...And Justice for all proves that Metallica's era as metal genius was over.<br />As a testament to what they proved to be, Metallica delivers both fast and heavy tunes with very complex harmonies making it very close to a progressive band with real power metal backing it up.<br />All lyrics are excellent and the music just blows you away from the brutal speed metal in Blackened to the semi-ballad intro of One. Harvester of Sorrow, ...And Justice for All, Dyer's Eve are all masterpieces on its own.<br />From a time when Kirk used to play solos (marvelous ones), Lars used to bang drums as fast as a Formula 1 car, Jason started composing and reaping guitar-like notes from his bass and Jaymz used to roar both with throat and axe...<br />Whatever happened to these guys?<br />This one along with the other 3 aforementioned albums, are must-have for all metalheads around the world. If you don't have it yet, what are you waiting for?
0783226888|4.0|Best:<br />1) Bruce Willis was very cool as the aloof assassin, as was Richard Gere in the non-standard role the Irish ex-IRA soldier tracking him.<BR>2) Many scenes were suspensful and exciting - especially the ending. There's also a twist about who the assassin is really targeting.<BR>3) The specially-built hardware the &quot;Jackal&quot; used was extremely radical and watching him practice was quite a sight.<BR>4) There's a director commentary track, interviews and a behind-the-scenes feature.<br />Worst:<br />1) It falls short of being a worthy remake of &quot;The Day of the Jackal&quot; (but it delivers on simply being a good movie that uses the same premise).<br />Recommendation:<br />If you like movies that are mostly suspense, then you'll probably like this cat-and-mouse thriller. The action scenes, although brief, are pretty intense. Get this one and enjoy seeing the ever-joking Jack Black getting his just deserts - over and over again (ha).
0060920084|4.0|Bryson's travel books, of which I've read several, don't require you to actually travel for enjoyment.  I'm fairly certain this is the first of his travel adventures put into novel form, and although not as enjoyable as his later commentary on the U.S. (I'm A Stranger Here Myself) it's quite funny nonetheless.  Buy it, read it, and then read his later works.  You'll get a kick out of it.<br />For what it's worth, I gave it 4 stars because it's a very funny book -- but if my review does not sound like a typical four star review, that's because his later works deserve 6 stars on the five star scale.
0156027321|4.0|When I started reading this book, I really liked it.  It was very enjoyable, but It said that when I was done, I'd believe in God.  This story didn't change my mind.  How can he believe in God with what happened to his parents?
076790382X|5.0|This book nails us -- simply put.  After buying it, I took it to the gym for light reading while doing cardio exercise, and I have to say, I probably put on five pounds during that period.  I simply could not stay on the stairmaster long enough because I was laughing so hard.  It's one of those books you take with you everywhere you go, and read even while you're walking to and from places.<br />Enjoy.  I sure did.
B00008WG3U|1.0|THIS ALBUM SUCKS SO BAD. RATING THIS CD IS ACTUALLY NOT ACCURATE BECAUSE IT DOESNT EVEN DESERVE 1 STAR. THIS LIBERAL PROPAGANDA NONSENSE SHOULD BE BURNED AND EVERYONE NEEDS TO BE WARNED!
0385504209|2.0|The Da Vinci Code is a real page-turner, in spite of its adjective-laden, high-school-creative-writing-class style, and I can see why its pseudo-religious goddess-worshipping \\"historical\\" background would be appealing to college students and others who seek justification for promiscuity and are unaware of the truths of history. There are a couple of thought-provoking nuggets hidden in the background, but they will probably be overlooked by most readers, either because they lack an understanding of early Jewish and Christian beliefs or because they are just caught up in an exciting story. The whole idea of a harmonious, goddess-loving, Nature-worshipping society existing before the formation of the Catholic Evil Empire is just ridiculous. Though some ancient philosophers did have ideas about \\"holy unions\\" and the sacredness of female procreative powers, and there were indeed active fertility cults throughout the ancient world (and a few today, though I think they mainly capitalize on the sexual aspects) the generally poor status and treatment of women in virtually every ancient society is proof enough that these beliefs were not widely held nor practiced. I imagine that Mr. Brown was not seriously presenting a world-view in his novel, but I fear that many will try to create one from some of his \\"facts.\\"<br />Also distracting for me was the predictability of the plot - I knew who \\"The Teacher\\" was almost from the moment his named alter-ego was presented, and the many riddles and passwords were easy to figure out - and the ludicrous pacing. The implications for the future of the protagonists was annoyingly Hollywood-ized. True love in less than 24 hours, only in a Hollywood novel. The epilogue was also a laugh, though it did make me long to see Paris and the Louvre once again.<br />I can't believe there's enough here to make an even remotely believable movie out of, but then again, what is popcorn for?
0385507755|5.0|When I read the first page, I was taken aback by his way of writing. It's definitely not conventional, and he would deserve punishment from a grammar teacher. That being said, I think his way of writing contributed to the effectiveness of this book. The fact that he could be so brutally honest, knowing that everyone in the country was going to read his story, is mind-blowing. I've already recommended this book to all of my friends, and despite other reviews that you may read that put this book down, IGNORE them. Buy it. Read it. You may even want to read it twice. It's the kind of book that's so good, you don't want it to end. Honestly, I cried more than a few times. Awesome!!
B000002H97|5.0|Adernilane rush .Amped, Fear,Love,Hate <br />These all describe this album<BR>it is literlaraly one of the best albums of all time<BR>get this album it is seriously amazing great guitars great drum and cutting vocals and big bass. Get this
B000001DTM|5.0|This was one of the first albums I bought, on tape, right when it came out in the early 90s. I was a teen and just getting into music. Having not much to compare it to at the time, I found it interesting, slightly inaccesible but powerful at the same time. Other albums I bought around that time were &quot;Kerosene Hat&quot; by Cracker, Pearl Jam's &quot;Ten,&quot; and the soundtrack to the movie &quot;Singles&quot;- all early mainstream alternative rock.<br />Well, my tastes in music changed and in a few years I gave this tape to a friend as I had lost interest. By that time, U2 was old news for me. I didn't come back to it for years. In the interim I had been listening to everything from punk rock to jam rock, along with Jazz and Blues, even some modern classical.  But when a friend lent me this on CD a couple years ago, I was impressed by the quality of the music here.<br />I view this as being a transition into a new area for the band, somewhat like Sgt. Pepper's was for the Beatles (my friend who lent it to me said the same thing- in case he reads this, no I am not stealing your idea, man!).  Instead of allowing themselves to get trapped and pigeonholed, the members radically shifted gears and picked up on some non-rock musical trends unlike anyone else at the time. But beneath all that is still that edgy stadium rock sound, the one that made them so unique to begin with. They are great songwriters and it shows here, everywhere. &quot;Trying to Throw your Arms Around the World&quot; is my favorite, for its lyrics and the peacefulness of the music. But that's just me.<br />Whenever I hear this, I think back to 1992 when I was in high school and just getting into music. It's been a good decade, more, since that time, but the music has really held its own. And that's really saying something.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I love this show,perhaps more than any show in recent memory.<BR>when i first saw the horridly misleading (&quot;intersteller hooker and a girl in a box&quot;??!!) promos i knew that this was going to be another brilliant but cancelled show,i hate it when i am right.Firefly is pure magic.plain and simple.the chemistry of the cast alone is justification enough to make the purchase of this set,but throw in cleaver plots,smart writing and dialog that you really feel...it adds up to F*X doing what they do best...more 'reality' Go-Se in place of the good stuff.Browncoats Unite.<BR>Keep Flying
B0000CNY27|5.0|PICTURE QUALITY (5/5 STARS)<BR>UNBELIEFABLE!!! Looks like all-new!! The new transfer is so much sharper and more detailed than the previous one, I am impressed!<br />SOUND QUALITY (4/5 STARS)<BR>The NEW Dolby Digital 5.1 remix is great: clearer voices and extraordinary surround effects, but without a good surround system you might overhear some dialogue which was specially isolated to a define channel. In some scenes (i.e. broadway scene) the effects are significantly louder than the music on the previous release. Although this release lacks an original mono-track in English, it features a Frensh mono track.<br />EXTRAS (4/5 STARS)<BR>THE CUT BANK ROBBERY SCENE (only on the second special features disc, without an an option to view the whole film with this several minutes long scene), featurettes (with commentaries), photo galleries, traisers, teasers.<br />SPECIAL/UNIQUE ON THIS DVD RELEASE:<BR>- anamorphic Widescreen<BR>- NEW Dolby Digital 5.1 remix<BR>- deleted bank robbery scene<br />COMMENT:<br />This is a great movie and deserves this new great treatment! Isaac Hayes is great in the role of the Duke of New York and Kurt Russel is even more superb in the role of Snake Plissken! The cut bank robbery scene is very cool (with commentary!) and the quality is typically pretty descent but introduces some new great music in these scenes that never appears again in the movie! For fans of the great Carpenter score there is another good bite: the menues feature also some new music (I figure it is specially recorded for this release). For all Plissken fans there is a little comic book included and a note for an upcoming computer game?! Let's see what is comming next... \\"Escape From Washington\\"? CHEERS
068487217X|3.0|Angela's Ashes, by Frank McCourt, is the story of an Irish Cathloic boy born in the United States who learns to adapt to the poverty stricken town of Limerick. Frank vividly recaps the disturbing events of his childhood, while keeping the reader hopeful right up to the last page. Although Frank has to take on the man of the house role, while his father drinks himself stupid, his determined will to survive pervails. This memoir is narrated in the first person by a young Frank who uses blunt language and childish syntax. After reading this book you will feel like you can overcome any obstacle you experience with a smile on your face.
B00000K19E|2.0|I'm sick and tired of people being so hung-up on firsts. Check out ANY music artist, and people will ALWAYS tell you that their first album was their best. It's the same thing with movies, and, quite frankly, with &quot;The Matrix&quot;, they're totally wrong.<br />I loved this movie when it first came out. It was undeniably creative, had great special effects, and really revolutionized the way action films would be looked at from then on. Then, &quot;The Matrix Reloaded&quot; hit the screens. After watching all the brand new, ultra-cool stunts, taking time to think over the philosophies, and trying to take in all the aspects of its massive scale, I can safely tell you that it makes this film look rather lame.<br />Sure, the lobby shootout and the battle in the subway station are excellent, but when compared to &quot;Reloaded&quot;'s burly brawl, freeway chase, and chateau death match, I just can't put the original on a pedestal. &quot;Revolutions&quot; with its truly epic battle for Zion (which set a benchmark in digital animation), and final showdown even further this film's mediocrity.<br />&quot;The Matrix&quot; has never been a series people came to for its writing or acting, and this one is no exception. Keanu Reeves is dry in his delivery, but makes up for it with all the coolness of his trench coat and sunglasses. The philosophical points and views expressed in the sequels are almost totally absent in the original, with the concept of a matrix of control constantly taking center stage during the dialogue scenes. Since Neo doesn't fully become 'The One' until the last minutes of the film, you won't be seeing very much of his lightning quick Kung-Fu either, and, to me, that removes a lot of this film's excitement.<br />It's safe to say that &quot;The Matrix&quot; is a good movie, but if you want something that will blow you away both mentally and visually, check out either of the two sequels instead.
B000000YBQ|5.0|That was an album title, and still holds at the center. Scotty La Faro was an insupportable loss, and so, too was Bill. Who ever heard a bad lick from either of them? But, this album is about the best. Bill Evans recorded a lot, but Scotty's legacy is so fragmentary. Another good side he made was the one with Hampton Hawes and Harold Land.
B00000I0XW|5.0|Her rendition of Chanson D'Enfance is wonderfull.  <BR>While her version of Don't Cry for me Argentina lacks the bite necessary to listen to it in the context of the play, it is much better as a stand alone song than the original version with Elaine Paige.  Sarah sings the song rather than the part.<BR>Her delivery of Another Suitcase in Another Hall is just incredible. I can accept the reduction in the marimba part just for her delivery of the opening to each verse.  That song alone is worth the money. <BR>Otherwise it is quite good.  The only song that I feel is anything but strong would be her rendition of Memory.
0316666343|3.0|A good enough read, but the ending left (for me) much to be desired.  I felt it was sort of a cop out, actually.  Know exactly how I would have rewritten it.  Still, good to read, and yes, it did grip your attention from the start.  Although I wasn't exactly pleased with the ending, I hope there will be more from this author.  She has the power and skill to write many a good book.
0375432302|2.0|I had such high expectations. Really I did. But the plot was ridiculous (yet I guessed most of the twists long before they came anyway), much of the &quot;research&quot; was sloppy, the premise was ill-defended, and the characters were absurd, absolutely and totally absurd.<br />Sorry, but it's true. Maybe I've just read too many mysteries.<br />I know it's fiction, but even in fiction, people are supposed to act like people. And while disbelief can be suspended, readers shouldn't have to suspend all logic as well -- particularly in a mystery, for goodness' sake. And that's what this silly book requires one to do.<br />I don't know much about the Knights Templar, but I have to think that this book is a complete and total disservice to them. And to Paganism and the Catholic Church, for that matter. It did make me want to find out more (particularly about the Knights), but mainly because I feel a near-obligation to correct the vast amount of misinformation that I undoubtedly picked up from this book.<br />My advice is: Don't waste your time.
0671027344|5.0|I'm someone who usually doesn't read outside of school...only two or three times including this one. I opened this book up after practice one day and sat there...and read and read and read. I stopped to finish homework...and picked it up again at night and the next day i carried it around school with me and read whenever we had about 3 minutes left in class or finished a test or something of the sort...haha and yeah and then i went home and had one more part left and i finished it...i could read it about 50 times and i dont think i would get tired of it. Most of charlie's feelings in the book can be related to by anyone. On the first page...this is my favorite part 'I just need to know that someone out there listens and understands...' at times, everyone can relate to that...please read this... I also agree with the review for the losers' club by richard perez. another weird book I couldn't put down.
B0000E6XH3|5.0|This is probably the best film I have seen this year so far. The way the film has no dialogue, and just lets the wonderful music of Daft Punk tell the story is so excellent. It can seem a little cheesy at times, but all the while you are still dazzled by the music, and you'll never turn away from the story line.
0802130208|5.0|Toole's book is an ambitious work of comedy, highlighted by one of the most memorable literary creations ever, Ignatius J. Reilly.<br />Reilly is an unforgettable character, a self-described anachronism who dresses in a plaid flannel shirt and a green hunter's cap, all the while bemoaning the loss of \\"taste and decency\\" in modern times, equating the breakdown of the Medieval system with the ascendancy of chaos and lunacy. He fills notebooks with vitriol detailing his contempt for the regular dregs of society, imbibes and belches up countless bottles of Dr. Nut, and likens his mother to an adolescent floozy. A portly man, he lounges, eats, and farts constantly, his sedentary life interrupted only by a need to find a job.<br />Reilly's escapades as a working man who never works are simply hilarious. His first job is at a pants factory, where he files away papers by throwing them in the garbage, ignores his boss, and befriends an elderly senile employee named Miss Trixie. After being fired for planning an uprising in the warehouse, Reilly finds a job that is perfect for him--pushing a hot dog cart through downtown New Orleans, dressed in a pirate's costume. When his hot dog cart is stolen, Ignatius smartly quips, \\"The human desire for food and sex is relatively equal. If there are armed rapes, why should there not be armed hot dog thefts?\\"<br />While the character of Ignatius Reilly is undoubtedly exaggerated and perhaps even absurd, Toole uses Reilly to render his indictment of contemporary society, the novel becoming a vehicle in which hoi polloi are relegated to the role of the dunce, forever confined to a world of indecency. Ignatius is the unconventional hero, tragically confined to the fringes of society.<br />The great tragedy of the novel, however, is author John Kennedy Toole's inability to heed the advice of his own protagonist. In troubling times, Ignatius Reilly, ever devoted to medieval philosophy, would have reminded Toole of Boethius's rota fortunae. Wait long enough and the wheel of fortune will turn your way. Tragically, in his depths of despair, Toole ended his own life, unable to wait for that final turn. Along with this novel, I'd like to recommend another quick Amazon pick: The Losers' Club by Richard Perez
B000005J56|5.0|Even as a relative new acquaintance to Cuban music, it was not hard to hear the sheer genius and power of the sounds, the music and the experience. This group of musicians have very touching stories in every sense, how they strived to achieve excellence in utter poverty, how fate brought them together, how most of the world almost missed noticing the contribution of these artists to the music of the 20th Century. Despite their struggles, the music that you will hear on in this collection is in as pristine as mountain snow, in its own sense. A wonderful blend of Salsa and Mambo and Jazz and blues - will appeal equally to all audiences.
B0000E5PEE|5.0|I listened this album over and over. I really loved all the songs, one of my favorites is &quot;Cinema Paradiso&quot;, is absolutly beautiful. The voice of Dulce Pontes I think is one of the bigest voices. I really enjoyed this album, i hope you will enjoy this like me.

B0000025WQ|4.0|Before becoming another 80s solo pop star, Cyndi Lauper was in a band named BLUE ANGEL. Nobody ever knew who she was.

This album shows that Cyndi was off to a fresh start. <br />MONEY CHANGES EVERYTHING<BR>  The second single from the album. Awesome song.<br />GIRLS JUST WANT TO HAVE FUN<BR>  The first single from the album. This song definitely defines Cyndi's sound and image.

I hate Prince.<br />TIME AFTER TIME<BR>  The third single from the album. Although a great song, I'm kind of tired of hearing it.<br />SHE BOP<BR>  The fourth single from the album. I've always liked this song. When I first heard what the song was really about, my mouth dropped. The song is about female masturbation. I can't believe that the critic didn't bother Cyndi on this one. If Madonna had done it, they would have harrassed her. <br />ALL THROUGH THE NIGHT<BR>  The fifth and final single from the album. This song is one of my favorites. I heard the live version of this and I wasn't all that impressed, but this song is one of her best.<br />WITNESS<BR>  Okay.<br />I'LL KISS YOU<BR>  Not bad.<br />HE'S SO UNUSUAL<BR>  Pretty funny.<br />YEAH YEAH<BR>  Okay.<br />    The album isn't as good as her third, which would be A NIGHT TO REMEMBER, but this one is still worth the money.
B00005QCYC|4.0|I think the first two Jurassic Park movies were excellent and nicely planned out but as far as the third one goes I think it is just plain junk and was most likely made in a hurry.<br />The third one appears to not be very planned out. I'd hate to see a 4th one come out. Jurassic Park is one of those movies that should have stopped after second one.<br />I gave it a 4 only because of the first two.  <br />I don't suggest any one watching 3rd one if a Jurassic Park fan,because what a disappointment it was.
B00005JLSE|5.0|This DVD is a hoot, even after repeated viewings.  Seeing Richard Gere in a musical would be, by itself, worth the price, but then throw in Queen Latifa in a stellar performance, and this DVD pretty  much pays for itself.
B0000VAFO0|4.0|Underworld is an ambitious movie, but to appreciate it one needs to understand that it is the first installment in a trilogy.  Also, and this is important, Underworld tells a story.  I suspect that this will be a better story when all three parts of the trilogy are filmed and can be viewed in one sitting.<br />Perhaps a third of Underworld's two hours is no-holds-barred battle between Lycans and vampires, waged sometimes with stylish modern weaponry, sometimes with tooth and claw.  The remainder is exposition, back-story, character interaction and plot movement.  As a storytelling vehicle, conflicts rage on many levels through the film: a conflict between elder and younger vampires in the Covens; a conflict between Lycans and vampires; Selene's inner conflict as she reconciles her ages-old hatred of Lycans with her feelings for an innocent newly introduced to the Lycan-vampire blood feud and her unquestioning loyalty to a vampire Elder who had been like a father to her for centuries...<br />As a stand-alone film, Underworld is not perfect, but it is trying to do a lot in two hours: give us the back-story of the ancient feud between Lycans and Vampires; introduce us to the vampire Covens and the Elders &lt;Michael, Amelia, Viktor&gt;; introduce Selene and the Death-dealers, give us a glimpse into the Lycan culture; introduce us to Michael Corvin and Selene and Kraven and other notables; illustrate their strengths and weaknesses...<br />It succeeds in several interesting ways.  There is a point in the film where our understanding of who and what the principals are, our understanding of what motivates them, shifts.  This is the sort of thing that many who went to see the film will hate.  It's time spent away from the flash of claws and baring of teeth.  It is, though, very satisfying from a storytelling and character perspective.  It enhances Underworld's replay value, makes a second or third watching of the movie more interesting because characters we know from the first hour are more fully developed by the end of the film, and more interesting for it.<br />Underworld doesn't throw one side at another until one side 'wins'.  Underworld is several stories: a love story, yes, but more than that it is several characters' efforts to resolve an ancient conflict between Lycans and vampires, each in their own way.  We begin the film with Selene and her Death Dealer comrades looking down on their prey, each single-mindedly dedicated to hunting the Lycans down, one by one, until the last.  By the end of the film, Underworld has given us a glimpse into the true nature of the conflict and the true character of its principals.<br />In sum, what weakens the first film is what may make the trilogy interesting.  If Underworld had been non-stop battle, a second and third movie would feel more like installments in a franchise and less like what I think they will be: the middle and end-point in a six or seven hour story.<br />Final note: Casting was quite good with each character (Beckinsale's Selene, Speedman's Michael, Viktor, Lucian, et. al.) delivering a performance that matched their character nicely.  Special effects were also quite good.  The sound track tried a little too hard at points to give the film an edge, didn't always sync up.  Overall though, high marks.
B00004SU5J|4.0|Quite simply, Tourist is a quintessential album to own for those interested in Europe's developing jazz and house scene.  Artist Ludovic Navarre fuses blues and jazz instrumentation and improvisational ideas with house beats and loops while adding a distinctly European folk feel to his music.  The songs on this album span a wide breadth of influence, from US jazz and house to Latin beats and goes across the Atlantic to the Cafes of France for the ambience.  Perfect for mixing.  Always lively without being overbearing, this CD is a perfect addition to anyone's library and a necessary one for afficionados of the genre.
B00005R24G|5.0|The idea of a movie with only two actors in it may not sound overly exciting, but when you watch \\"Sleuth\\" for the first time, you realize that it couldn't have worked any other way. For many years, \\"Sleuth\\" has been one of my favorite movies, and remains so to this day. It is cleverly written and superbly acted by both Michael Caine (my all time favorite actor) and Sir Laurence Olivier.<br />The tag line \\"Think of the perfect crime...then go one step further\\" describes exactly what the movie is all about. Olivier plays Andrew Wyke, an eccentric and revered mystery writer invites Milo Tindle (Caine) over to his mansion over a weekend in order to discuss the terms of his affair with his wife. Wyke is known as a lover of toys, games, and deviously cunning games of trickery that he plays on people. Wyke has known for some time that Tindle has been having an affair with his wife, and that he intends to marry her. Wyke sees an opportunity to unload his wife, without the possibility of her coming back and getting deeper into his pocketbook. Knowing him to be broke, Wyke proposes to Tindle a robbery scheme that will solve both of their problems. Things got a bit awry. What happens next would be criminal to give away, but it is one of the most brilliantly crafted farces I have ever seen in a movie.<br />\\"Sleuth\\" was adapted from the stage play by Anthony Shaffer, and it plays out very much like the play itself. There is one setting, two actors, and lots of dialogue. It works very well, because it wasn't overdone in production. I cannot see how this could have worked with a more elaborate setting or cast. What carries the movie are the performances by Caine and Olivier, which ranks among their personal best (and picking ones from such distinguished careers is hard). Their interaction between each other is riveting, since their characters are so cunning. \\"Sleuth\\" was made in 1971, and 30 years on, every aspect of the movie has aged well. It is one of those movies that makes time stand still, and you are unaware that 2 hours has gone by at the end of it. That is the token of a great movie.<br />The Anchor Bay DVD boasts the best transfer and sound quality of \\"Sleuth\\" so far, though the previous versions were also very good (including the VHS, which is rare for older movies). The main supplement is the 20 minute featurette \\"A Sleuthian Journey with Anthony Shaffer\\", in which the famous playwright is interviewed on his experiences with the play, the making of the movie, and his interactions with the filmmakers. He is jovial and gives plenty of fun anecdotes throughout the interview. Aside from that, there are talent bios and the usual trailers and TV spots. Considering the age and modest budget, not much in the way of extras should be expected.<br />\\"Sleuth\\" is a rare movie that I can watch over and over again, and I am pleased to see that Anchor Bay did justice to the movie with this excellent (and modestly priced) DVD. An easy purchase for any movie fan.ime stand still, and you are unaware that 2 hours has gone by at the end of it.

0743243307|4.0|A peek at a Bangaladeshi female immigrant's experience in the big wide world of London is what Ali provides us readers in Brick Lane. Raised as the docile and obedient daughter, Nazneen accepts an arranged marriage to an old man who takes her from Bangladesh to a Bangladeshi community in London. There, for the first time, she comes in contact with (or at least observes) the freedoms of Western women in The Land of Opportunity. Within the tight Bangaladeshi community, author Ali gives us all degrees of the immigrant experience through Nazneen's eyes. This unsparing look into a world of suppression that few of us can imagine is very gracefully rendered.
0385507755|5.0|One of the most compelling novels I've read.  The author grips you from the first sentence and won't let you go. &quot;A Million Little Pieces&quot; stays with you long after you finished reading the last sentece.  You feel every emotion of the author as he shares his innermost thoughts and fears.  You are taken along a  painful, honest, scary, loving, vulnerable and courageous journey. I cried and laughed.  It was a rollercoaster of emotions.  This is a must read for everyone.  This is not a book merely for the addict or recovering addict.  Everyone will come away from reading this book a more compassionate person with a greater understanding of the human soul and our own vulnerability thanks to the honesty of James Frey.  I look forward reading more of Mr. Frey's work.
B00005JLSE|5.0|Hot damn, what a great movie! Even my 88yo mother, who was weaned on the musicals of the 40s, loved this movie. It made her think of Rogers/Astair, Charisse/Kelly, etc. Chicago, an adaptation of the 1975 musical about a frisky murderess, is set in the 20's era of Jazz with all the Mafia overtones, the tabloid sensationalism, and the wonderful music of the era. <BR>Renee Zellweger and Catherine Zeta-Jones, yeah, we figured they could probably lay the moves onto a good dance routine, but who knew Richard Gere could dance? Not just dance, mind you, but REALLY dance. He's usually oh so coooool, but here he shows an entirely new side, and it works. Oh baby, does it work. No dubbing. They all did their own singing and dancing, and it's terrific. Don't miss it.
0670880728|5.0|I loved this book! If you are (or were) single and nearing the dreaded age of 30, you must read this book! Helen does a great job of capturing what it is like to be single and the harrasment that comes from family and married friends. Always trying to set you up, pointing out men, &quot;casually&quot; placing you with a male guest at a party... Bridget always seems to have bad things happen to her... she's late for meetings at work, burns food when she tries to cook, lots of one time dates, no cards on valentines day, etc. The diary blurbs are hilarious as like many women, Bridget weighs herself, counts calories, number of drinks and cigarettes. I am also in the middle of Edge of Reason and it is every bit as funny!
0375703861|5.0|That Zadie Smith was only 23 when White Teeth was published amazes me as much as the youth of Matt Damon and Ben Afleck when they wrote Good Will Hunting.<BR>How can she write a sprawling epic of immigrants, mixed-race, mixed-religion, class-based, exploration of society novel that begins with the youth of one generation and ends with the maturation of the next generation - at her age, I mean? At 23, I was so clueless that I was dangerous. Not Zadie Smith, no sirree. <BR>I'm not even going to try to name the multiple characters and their roles. Just read this book, and then keep an eye on the author. She's no flash in the pan.
0808514121|5.0|Excellent book. The characters are SOOO well developed and the insight into the human mind so profound that I will have a hard time picking up a typical murder mystery again.  I spent much time pondering some of the magical paragraphs and exhalting in the fantastic ending.  It is great after reading the \\"Da Vinci Code\\" since it also considers the true origins of parts of the Bible.  This is a great read and a great book club selection.
0790738139|5.0|I keep getting this confused, when people are talking about it, with Chinatown - and no wonder. The similarities are striking, but the biggest is that both movies are terrific.<BR>LA Confidential is a gritty tale of scandal, betrayal, corruption, and that essential ingredient: sex. <BR>Incredibly well-acted roles by a host of actors: Kim Basinger, Russell Crowe, Buy Pearce, the inimitable Kevin Spacey, Danny DeVito - and that only scratches the surface.<BR>Plenty of reviews go on and on about this movie - and for good reason. However, I'd like to avoid being repetitions and will just add my vote to the others:<BR>GO RENT IT. Now.
B00004XOWM|1.0|All of you haters need to stop listening to Britney Spears and stick it up your YEAH! Stick it up your YEAH! You are just mad cause he did all for the nookie.<br />You can't handle real hard core. Durst says the F word a lot. The first song is a lotta 'F this, f that!'<br />Ok guys, listen to the lyrics of &quot;Getcha Groove On&quot; and &quot;Rollin'.&quot; Then watch the videos. In the near future, we will be laughing at this pathetic poop in the same way we make fun of Vanilla Ice now.<br />I'll admit I can't stand Limp Bizkit from the moment they came out, BUT, I assure you, this is far worst than their earlier work. I've listened to just about everything they put out because I used to have cruel roommates. Don't buy this album, and go find something good better that isn't rigged on TRL. I think Nu Metal stinks in general, but I'd bet you'll find something much better (or real hardcore) if you look more towards the underground and independant bands.
0140059156|5.0|This book is not written in accordance with current literary tastes.  It is descriptive to the point where it is florid sometimes; the writer's politics and elitism can easily offend(he is thoughtlessly snobbish towards characters such as Hooper); and he is describing a vanished world that can be difficult to understand--the sort of aristocrats he describes do not exist anymore and maybe they shouldn't exist (one could reasonably call them parasites).  However, the same things could be said about many of the novels that are most worth reading (think of novels from nineteenth century Russia for example).  The sensitive reader will soon realize that Waugh is talking about the human condition in this book and showing the necessity of faith, as all that they have materially cannot satisfy these people.  They still have a void that can only be filled by God and God pulls them, no matter how much they try to run away from this fact.  These are real human beings who are involved in definite sins such as adultery; homosexuality (though it is unclear whether Sebastian and Charles have a physical relationship, the homoerotic undertones in their relationship are very strong, and there are several other openly homosexual characters);alcoholism runs rampant; the narrator has the sin of pride.  However, God has grace to handle all of it, and Waugh brilliantly uses Dante's philosophy of human love (including the sinful love such as the adultery and that with the homoerotic element) leading human beings towards the divine love which it is a mirror of.  He will make you uncomfortable and challenge your late twentieth/early twenty-first century ideas of moral relativism as he is very uncompromising about what is right and what is wrong and believes in such unstylish things as 'sin', 'redemption', 'duty' and 'sacrifice'.  However, he NEVER preaches. The depiction of Sebastian in his later years is one of the most moving things, I think, in all literature, as he describes the destruction of his beauty and his grace in the alcoholism, shows what a total wreck he has made of his life by worldly standards, and yet lets you feel that he has achieved something else with his pain, which is the salvation of his soul.  And so there is hope for Julia, for Charles and for all of the other extremely flawed people in this novel.  In a world that seems to be dying (one of the best things about the book is its depiction of the world at war).<br />Maybe some of us could use some of this message in a world in which so many more people, not just the 'aristocrats' but also the 'Hoopers' of the world (at least in Europe and America) have so much financially, and are spiritually so miserable.  And don't even realise that our disease is spiritual, or if we do, try to salve it with easy, patched-together counterfeits of religion that can do nothing for us, like people taking pleasant-tasting placebos instead of real medicine.on of his beauty and his grace in the alcoholism, shows what a total wreck he has made of his life by worldly standards, and yet lets you feel that he has achieved something else with his pain, which is the salvation of his soul.

B00009KO08|5.0|This review applies only to the Canadian DVDs released by TVA films. Do not buy them. They're vastly inferior to the American DVD from Universal. <br />I bought the 2 Disc version because the extra features seemed to be more extensive than the American disc. This is not the case. The American release simply has one two-sided disc instead of the Camnadian's two one-sided ones. There is an additional trailer or two on the Canadian release, that's it. <br />However, the negatives are much more important. First, the main bonus feature on both the TVA and Universal DVDs is a 40 minute documentary about the making of the film. It's informative and intelligently made. <br />However, the TVA disc has French subtitles which cannot be removed. I understand the market for this in Quebec, but for English speakers this is infuriating as you try to watch.<br />Worse, the transfer of the film is markedly less sharp than the Universal disc. I rented the Universal disc and compared them side by side. I took captures on my computer and compared them frame for frame. There's no contest -- the Universal disc has a much sharper, clearer transfer.<br />Also, the TVA transfer has a noticable flicker to it, which seems to have been caused by using a European PAL transfer from which to make the discs. Since PAL uses a different frame rate, the frames don't match up to this NTSC disc and cause frames that are half one image and half the image from the next shot.<br />Avoid at all costs. I ended up wasting money on a Canadian set only to sell it used and finally pick up the American disc.
B00003CWN3|5.0|This is a very important movie and I recommend it to anyone (over 18 only because of the violence and sexuality).<br />The true story of Teena Brandon, \\"Boys Don't Cry\\" will make you sick, sad, and intrigued at the same time.  Having grown up in a small rural town full of tunnel-visioned people, I can relate with the movie from the stand point of being different and sticking out like a sore thumb.<br />Yes, this film has been \\"Hollywood-ized\\", but the true story it is based upon has been told without apology or disclaimer. Because it is an independent film, it doesn't have the big-budget look, and it really doesn't need it.  The story gets told honestly, and with a story like this, it wouldn't have been right any other way.<br />Hillary Swank deserved her Oscar for this, and you will believe her portrayal of a woman trying her darndest to be a guy.  Many times, I forgot that she was a woman, but not in a campy, impersonator-type way.  She looks like a young, baby-faced boy/man, and has the mannerisms, look, and lingo down.<br />This is a tragic tale and Teena Brandon was definitely a messed-up individual, however, her gender-identity really takes a back seat to her up-bringing, her choice of friends, her habitual lying, and troubles with the law.  Because of the combination, she is ignored by her family and the legal-system; the two entities anyone should be been able to count on.  In the end, these are the things that kill her - the two morons who pull the trigger are just the vehicle.  Still, you will end up hating the killers and see their backwards, red-necked male-macho baloney for what it is way before the movie heats up.<br />This is more than just a transgender movie, it is a complex tale that includes a cast of characters you have probably known once or twice in your life.  And that, hopefully, will make you think about and compel you to see this movie more than once.  It's message deserves that you do.
B00005JLEX|5.0|Everyone is on to why Seinfeld has not been released on DVD.  They want people to beg for it and judging from some of the letters posted on this site...WE ARE THERE !!! I moved from Texas in 2001 to Germany with my family while my husband is serving with the army. In a state of panic, I began taping the Seinfeld syndicated shows that were on the Fox network everynight at 10:30.  I was able to fill about 6 VHS tapes, capturing 12 episodes on each tape. Well, I'm here to tell you those tapes have kept us sane.  We have some tracking problems but we are still watching them and have even come to love the commercials. We sing along with them instead of fast forwarding in order to preserve the tapes. Jerry we are begging. Give us clear clean Seinfeld without commercials to watch over and over again.  <BR>In conclusion, Seinfeld is the best sitcom ever to grace the TV screen. LET'S DO IT PEOPLE!  Katie C.
0345423496|3.0|The most wonderful thing about 2001 was that there was so much we didn't know.  It blew my mind.  I enjoyed not knowing so much.  In 2010, he didn't answer questions, he just continued the leagacy, also making it a great book (not quite as good as 2001 but still very good).  In 2061, only few more questions were answered, making it okay but not great.  But now... in 3001, Clarke has revealed the answers to these questions, almost ruining the classic 2001.  Also, the fact that Frank Poole is still alive makes HAL seem less evil, which kind of defeats the point if you ask me.  2001 was great because we didn't know what the monoliths were, we didn't know who made them, and we didn't know about the future of David Bowman.<BR>   However, in 3001, all these questions are given answers.  In my opinion... I ENJOYED NOT KNOWING!
B00005JKJA|2.0|Rating this movie was tough.  2 stars doesn't do justice to David Lynch's masterful use of the camera to capture the color, tone &amp; brooding atmosphere of a Los Angeles that is at once shiny &amp; sinister.  In exposing the supernatural in the midst of the ordinary, a Lynch film is similar to a Stephen King book--the audience approaches both holding its breath, waiting for a Bogeyman to jump out and spook us--we know that what we see at first on the sunny surface will not be all we get.  In this film we do get an actual Bogeyman that resides behind a diner Dumpster no less.  And therein lies the problem<br />If this film is evaluated on its mastery of film techniques, it's worth 4 stars.  If it's evaluated on the basis of coherent narrative and plot of any kind, Lynch flunks.  Maybe it's a uniquely American weakness to demand that our films make sense, have something called 'a storyline', and if that's a weakness, it's one I don't apologize for.  The film starts promisingly--a beautiful young woman being threatened at gunpoint (and we know from her sultry looks that she's not a Good Girl) is saved from certain death when her captors are killed in a car crash.  Stunned &amp; suffering from a head injury, she wanders away from the wreckage, spends the night behind some bushes, and sneaks into a stranger's apartment.  She's obviously hiding out, but from what?  Enter Betty, a fresh-faced blonde ingenue just off the plane from Ontario, ready for her big break in Hollywood.  She's staying in her aunt's empty apartment, the same apartment as fate would have it, that our mysterious accident victim has wandered into.  Betty is startled to find an unexpected visitor in her aunt's shower, a visitor that has amnesia and a handbag stuffed full of 100 dollar bills.  The two women forge a shaky friendship based on a mutual desire to determine the dark beauty's identity.  That's an intriguing beginning, but any semblance at a coherent narrative goes off the rails at this pointas Lynch seemingly pulls out every trick and device he learned at directing school, some of which serve his movie and some of which only serve to leave his audience completely bewildered.  The more lost I felt, the madder I got, because suspension of disbelief only works if the movie reality follows its own logic structure.  There is neither logic nor structure here.  After 2 hours and 27 minutes of Lynch's cinematic wanking, I had the distinct impression that he's laughing at his audience for being chumps enough to sit through this pyschic spew dressed up in the clothes of 'High Art'.
068484267X|4.0|Frank McCourt's bibliography sends you on a trip through the stuggles and hardships of living in Ireland during the 1940's. Although McCourt's life is difficult, he persevers through it all and returns to America, where he was born. His life begins in New York in a small apartment with younger siblings, Frank being the oldest. From the moment he is born, life is a struggle. Food and money are always short in the McCourt household due to an alcoholic father. Yelling and drunken scenes further pollute the desolate life. Starvation kills Frank's family one by one because his father cannot get a job and when he does get jobs he is immediately fired due to drinking. The family decides to move back to Ireland, beleiving that jobs are more available, but things actually become worse. Although they move continents, his father still has a drinking problem and his mother and father both develop a smoking problem.Jobs are not readily available and Mr.McCourt cannot seem to keep one. Money that should go to food from charitiesis used for liquor and cigarettes, which leads to more death. Mrs.McCourt's family outcasts the Americanized family and doesn't help much, putting the blame on Angela for marrying a north Irish man and moving to America at age 18 in search of a better life than he has ultimately lived. In conclusion, i enjoyed the book but was greatly saddened by the explicit detail of depression that grows from poverty and neglect.
B000089RVR|2.0|I really love Dido's &quot;No Angel&quot; CD, but unfortunately &quot;Life For Rent&quot; fails to live up to the standards set by &quot;No Angel&quot;.  In my oppinion the tracks all blend together, and are pritty boring sounding.  I dont really hear much of the passion in Dido's voice like we hear in 'Here with me' on &quot;No Angel&quot;.  &quot;White Flag&quot; IS a good song, as is &quot;See The Sun&quot;, besides these two tracks, the rest is fall asleep to music - nothing really special to say the least.  <BR>  If you like what you have heared on the radio by Dido, your probably best to get &quot;No Angel&quot;.  If your looking for slow background music &quot;Life For Rent&quot; is perfect!  If you want to listen to a great female artist try &quot;Liz Phair&quot; by Liz Phair, much better :-)
B0000C7PQK|4.0|okay, first of all in order to listen to this cd you must forget about other past enigma albums you have heard. this album is definitely a voyage and very, very diffrent. you will only hear a few things that will remind you of old enigma.  a. the classic opening, and b. sadeness (sandra whisper).  this was an in-store play in my place of employment. i got them to play this from sept. to january. (excluding nov. and dec. for holiday music) i personally love this cd. i like the more electronica vibe in the first song, all the way to the haunting piece in the very end of following the sun.   my personal favorites are from east to west, voyageur, boum-boum, the piano, look of today, and my absolute favorite-following the sun.   very diffrent music, but still just as awesome. the only thing i have to say i didn't like is the voice altering (i think vocoder(spelt wrong i think) machine that was used for much of cretu's voice. it detracted to what i believe could have been an even more powerful record. so in conclusion die hard fans of old enigma may not like this album, but people like me , who are open to change of style, will like this cd more.
B00005JMTN|4.0|Tim Burton's \\"Big Fish\\" is one of the more interesting movie going experiences I have had in some time.  The movie is well casted and acted, with the pacing and direction perfect.  Don't look for a complex storyline or big plot twist, because this movie really does not have much of a plot.  What it does have is a lot of heart, and characters you will enjoy spending 2 hours with.<br />Edward Bloom(Albert Finney) is dying.  As his son Will(Billy Crudup)comes to visit, Edward recalls lots of stories from his youth, about how he met his wife, his son's birth, different experiences he had, jobs he held, and so on.  Edward as a young man is played by Ewan McGregor.  His son has heard it all before and is upset because it is all make believe.  He hates that his father continues to fabricate these lies.<br />But the stories are magical and captivating.  Will's wife soon falls under the spell as she hears the stories Will has endured his whole life.  Every fisherman can tell a story about the \\"big one\\" that got away, hence the title of the movie.  The end of the film is not so much a development of the plot as it is a confirmation of it.  We suspected what we see, and we are happy with it.  James Thurber would have been proud.
0780631684|3.0|What really made me rate this movie lower was the continual use of the F word.  That is not at all necessary in making the movie work.  It was a good movie, though.  The type that keeps you on your feet.  It is nice to see movies that don't rely on anything sexual in their plot.
B00005JM4Z|2.0|There was a lot more street racing in this, but it sucked. Suki? Who thought of that genius character. She seemed so bad at acting. Maybe it was because her dialogue sucked! This whole movie is bland though. When you hate the characters, you hate the movie. I hated the characters, and you will too.
B0000AXE8I|3.0|I really enjoyed this movie, except for one very long scene.  I didn't appreciate the long, elaborate sex scene with the wild party with naked women.  Why, oh why, do movies always have to add these in?  It can ruin a good story.
B00005JLSE|1.0|I really found this movie bland. A girl aspires to be a broad-way baby. Terrific. I don't care about your problems though. She shoots a guy and ends up in prison.<br />The movie is a musical. This musical had me annoyed at every minute. How hard is it to stay down and not break out into a song every minute. Sit down, and stop singing. Give me a three second break.<br />I bet there are a few people getting ready to &quot;thumbs down&quot; my review. &quot;I liked that one song where they sang!&quot; No. If you hate musicals pass this up. There's no action. Also, the only comedy in the movie is the lack of sitting down for three seconds and not singing. Sit down. One second of not singing please. Get over the songs.
6305428220|4.0|This movie is enjoyable to watch.  It isn't very scary, but you can still sit down and enjoy watching it every now and then.
B00003CXTG|1.0|Once again, Hollywood has taken a day of importance and trashed it. The love story lasts the first hour of the movie. During that time there is no action.<br />The action scene for 45 minutes is alright. Theres few people with blood on them. The bombs look alright but seem to fall under the category of mediocre. Everything looks shameful. The only tragic thing is the music, which is depressing. They didn't show the real way it happened. It was violent and brutal.<br />The real thing that got to me was the way they tried to make everything dramatic. Cuba shoots down a plane. He cheers wildly. Theres still 137 other planes dude. Then the boys get their planes and shoot down 7 japanese planes. Are we suppose to be impressed? It took them 30 minutes just to get in the air. Pearl Harbor is a day of rememberance. I guess the battle scenes are okay. The problem is the love story.<br />3 hour movie. 2 hours are love story. 2 hours. 2 hours. 2 hours. Say that to yourself. This is Pearl Harbor, not love connection. I don't care if two guys love the same girl, find a different movie to put that garbage in. Pearl Harbor is about the men who died in their boats, not how a guy and a girl smooched. Save your money. The worst is the ending. Instead of actually showing you what happens they flash an American flag and a dude talks. Then they proceed into another overly-dramatic segment where we see a girl narrarate the story. It wasn't moving at all. 0 stars. O im sorry, due to Amazon I must at least give it 1.
0385504209|5.0|I don't usually &quot;do&quot; fiction.  But this book was amazing.  The plot is allways expanding, the research is allways interesting, and the ending is superb.  Now, i do take issue with some of it... Brown included a whole of real research in the novel, but it is mixed in with superstitious conspiracy theories and observations by main characters that look too deep into things.  This could lead to a reader of the novel to blow up the signifigance of certain things.<br />For those who will read the book, please remember this:  Not many researchers beleive Mary Magdalene was married to Jesus, The man sitting next to Jesus in DaVinci's last supper doesn't look like a woman, and there is no evidence that the search for the Holy Grail was the search for the womb of Mary Magdalene, the bloodline of Jesus Christ.<br />All in All, however, this is an amazing Novel and the only one I will probably ever read.  It's back to non-fiction for me.
B00000J7J4|4.0|If you want classic Santana, this ain't it.  Some of the reviews complain about that, but hey folks, time moves on!  Teaming with well written and &quot;Smooth&quot; artists of the current rock scene, Carlos has crafted an eminently enjoyable CD.  Yeah, a few lines may seem hokey, but this has the precision feel of an older Steely Dan album combined with a little latin taste (it is NOT Tito Puente kind of latin) and an array of talent.  I like his old stuff, I like this too.  You probably will as well!
0316921173|1.0|I'll quickly get to the point, which is something that Wallace himself is incapable of: utter crap! Now just imagine how many trees could have been saved at the expense of this man's career...
0743455967|5.0|This book is an autobiography and instruction manual all rolled into one.  In his usual easy style, King tells his story and you just have to listen.  I wasn't sure what to expect when I got this book.  I've always been a fan of his work but never knew much about him.  He does a good job tying himself in with his craft.
B0000CE742|5.0|Difficult to believe, but Cher has just celebrated her 40th birthday in music with an extraordinary hit collection. The last official compilations were on one CD only, but Cher's great talent could not be contained in such a little space. \\"The very best of Cher (2 cd set)\\" is the most complete official compilation up till now. <BR>Cher has passed through four decades of the international music panorama, and that's a real record! Innocent, sexy, sophisticated, she has been able to constantly change in time and become one of the last real divas, who can always surprise us without any vulgarity but with a great sense of humor.    <br />In these cds (more than 2 hours of music), we can rediscover the songs of the beginnings in the 60es, with Sonny Bono (\\"I got you Babe\\", \\"The best goes on\\" and \\"Baby don't go\\"), the ones that marked her solo-debut in the 70es (\\"Gypsies, tramps and thieves\\", \\"Half-breed\\", \\"Dark lady\\" and \\"Take me home\\"); we can then enjoy the songs of her brilliant return to the scenes in the late 80es (\\"I found someone\\", \\"If I could turn back time\\" and \\"Just like Jesse James\\") up to the ones of the 90es (\\"The shoop shoop song\\", \\"Love and understanding\\" and \\"One by one\\"). We finally come to the planetary hit \\"Believe\\", that gave back to Cher the role of the great interpreter that she deserves. \\"Believe\\" is the best selling album of her solo career. Thanks to this dance ballad she conquered the hearts of a new generation of admirers, fascinated by her charisma.   <BR>In the collection we can also find the songs of the dance turning point (\\"Strong enough\\", \\"All or nothing\\"), some of the recent hits contained in the last album \\"Living proof\\" (\\"The music's no good without you\\", \\"Song for the lonely\\" and \\"A different kind of love song\\") and some extra-tracks that did not get the same success of the most famous songs, but are interesting anyway (\\"Rudy\\", \\"Bad love\\", \\"Più che puoi\\" with Eros Ramazzotti, \\"All I never need is you\\" - Sonny and Cher - and \\"Born withthe hunger\\", from the album \\"Not commercial\\", released for internet sale only). <br />Cher is not only a singer, an actress or a soubrette...she is all these things with the addition of a secret ingredient that nobody has been able to identify yet.<BR>For the historical fans, this collection represents a synthesis of a boisterous career and for the new ones the perfect starting point to appreciate this fantastic woman.<br />Incredible Cher!
B000002UJQ|5.0|-OK Computer by Radiohead<BR>-Capitol<BR>-Explicit: No<BR>-Best Song: No Surprises<BR>-Worst Song: Let Down<br />This, right here, might just be the greatest record ever created. Yes, that's right. In my personal opinion, it is better than Pet Sounds. Better than Nevermind. Even, perhaps, better than Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band. And that's pretty amazing. A concept album painting a bleak, machinated future, it takes us from the opening rocker &quot;Airbag&quot; through the epic &quot;Paranoid Android&quot;, the spacey &quot;Subterranean Homesick Alien&quot;, the haunting interlude &quot;Fitter Happier&quot; and the lovely &quot;No Surprises&quot;, each with their own little stories to tell. Radiohead are never afraid of experimentation. Just listen to &quot;Paranoid Android&quot; and see the amount of changes it goes through before the 6 minute timeframe is up. The singles, with the possible exception of Let Down, are flawless. And originality shines through it all. While occationally evocative of Pink Floyd, Radiohead have trouble sounding even like themselves at times. And then there's &quot;Fitter Happier&quot;. &quot;Fitter Happier&quot; is, essentially, a computer generated voice speaking an absolutely memorable but strangely discomforting monologue, accompanied only by a faint piano. It's something only for you to hear. The lyrics are at their best. Go to [...] and see for yourself. Overall, OK Computer is a flawless masterpiece that deserves to be the crown jewel of your CD collection. Don't miss out on it. And when you get it, listen to it all the way. No skipping allowed.<br />Final Grade: A+
B000003TAW|5.0|This is the first review I've written and I usually don't &quot;post&quot; my opinions unless I feel strongly about something.<BR>I love this cd! I came upon it about five years too late from a former friend's older brother. It's now my favorite cd in the whole wide world and I honestly could not live without the song, &quot;Say It Aint So&quot; (track 7). As many other reviews have stated, this album has something the others lack. It's not necessarily &quot;raw&quot; or &quot;fresher&quot; (it is, but not completely)... I believe that it has a certain sincerity that the other don't have.
B00004ZAV3|4.0|-1 by The Beatles<BR>-Capitol<BR>-Explicit: No<BR>-Best Song: The Long And Winding Road<BR>-Worst Song: From Me To You<br />This was my introduction to The Beatles. I kid you not. And back then, there really wasn't anything wrong with it. As an introduction, it's spectacular. A \\"Beatles For Dummies\\" on record format. However, I do have a problem with it. There are many important songs missing. A double album would have been better. Where are \\"Strawberry Fields Forever\\", \\"Please Please Me\\", \\"A Day In The Life\\", \\"Tommorow Never Knows\\", \\"Happiness Is A Warm Gun\\", \\"Across The Universe\\", \\"I Am The Walrus\\", \\"Norwegian Wood\\"... Now you begin to get my point. While absolutely inferior in quality to the Blue Album, this is the best you can do to introduce newbies to the great musical genius of The Beatles.<br />Final Grade: A-
B0000DCYVT|2.0|Sooner or later, it would have to happen...Teen sensations Jim and Michelle are finally going to get married in this third episode of the \\"American Pie\\" series. Like the first two movies, this one is an average comedy with some funny characters who can make for the lack of a decent and creative plot. The jokes haven`t changed, going from predictable slapstick to utterly childish stuff, and for the most part the laughs are forced as they deal with trivial, unsurprising situations. Even though Jim is the one who`s getting married, Stifler seems to be the central character here, getting all the attention and acting in a particularly annoying way. But I knew what to expect anyway, so this isn`t much of a disappointment, although it`s probably the worst movie of the series. Still, it`s a passable flick to watch with some friends and laugh once or twice. It isn`t supposed to me more than that, anyway.
B00005A46T|2.0|Reading all the reviews on here makes me laugh. Everyone seems to think this is a heavy album, well, maybe compared to Celine Dion it might be. But, if you like tough music without wussy \\"singing\\" parts, or parts in the middle of the song where they wuss out and use dumb sound effects, then check out Soilent Green. Maybe next time if Slipknot wrote an album that was heavy ALL the way through instead of just once and a while, I could've given it 5 stars.
B00008EYA5|4.0|This is a good movie. The action is incredible and pretty constant. There isn't one boring moment in this movie it keeps you interested the whole way through. The cast is tight. Sam Jackson, colin farrell,Michelle Rodriguez ,( a beefed up and looking damn good at 40) LL Cool J , Jermey Renner. This movie is a must for action movie fans.
1565112318|4.0|This isn't the first Neil Gaiman I've read, having also listened to the author himself read an unabridged version of 'Coraline,' and having read in print 'Good Omens.' I like his urban fantasy (dark usually) style quite a bit. <BR> <BR>This story follows Richard, a fella who lives a rather normal life in a rather normal part of London, and who, out with a girl you'd rather he not live a normal life with, bumps into a small young woman who basically falls at his feet, beaten and bloody. Richard, being the nice guy, picks her up and helps her recover.<BR> <BR>You know that adage about no good deed going unpunished? Woah.<BR> <BR>Richard ends up running from two demonic sorts, after the girl, into 'London Below,' with the added bonus of that place sucking his above-London life into some sort of void, where no one can remember him. Before he's done, he'll suffer, try to find the girl, suffer, try to rescue the girl, suffer, meet an angel, and suffer. And there's some suffering, too.<BR> <BR>As always, Neil Gaiman's villains, and his heroes, have a fantastic depth to them, and the other characters are shifty and confusing enough that you can't quite figure out anyone's motives. It's a great story to listen to - and even though it was abridged, the sound effects and reading voice really added a great deal of tone to the story. I'm a little bit tempted to go find this unabriged and/or in print.  The world itself is easy to slip into, deep and dark and just wonderfully full of shadowy danger.  <BR> <BR>I think I need to find more Gaiman, regardless.<BR> <BR>'Nathan
B000003C5C|5.0|It's rare that among 20 reviews at amazon.com there's a united positive opinion resulting in 4,9 average rating.<br />Everything that there is about american death-metal, is present on this record. No filler, no stupid songs, no boring parts. Just excellent energetic violent death, superbly played.<br />This record is worth several dozens of records issued by Death's not-so-talanted competitors. Buy it, or your life is spent pointlessly :)
B00000DHRZ|5.0|This is a very good example of Offspring's newer stuff, they've turned pop-punk ever since 1996. But it still doesn't disappoint me, they seem to go with flow, as we got into the new millenium, they sounded much more well-polished on the album.<BR>Standout tracks on the record include &quot;The Kids Aren't Alright&quot;, &quot;She's Got Issues&quot; and &quot;Staring At The Sun&quot;, even so, all the songs deliver a high payload of pop-punk energy and really has your head shaking back and forth to the beat. More unique songs include &quot;Why Don't You Get A Job?&quot;, it features a country-rock style of the Offspring and much more melodic. Although a few tracks such as &quot;No Brakes&quot; and &quot;Americana&quot; didn't catch my attention, they still define what pop-punk should be. The intro for &quot;Pay The Man&quot; was far too long for my liking, so it usually results in listeners skipping that track.<br />Well, this is the new Offspring. It depends whether you like the newer Offspring more or the older Offspring, because &quot;Ignition&quot; &quot;Smash&quot;(older albums) sound really different from &quot;Americana&quot; and &quot;Conspiracy Of One&quot;(newer albums). If you liked the older ones, then this isn't the album for you. If you did like the newer ones, then this is the album for you/
B000000H40|4.0|D*mn, this was brutal back in 1990! What still strikes me about this record is John Tardy's low powerful gutteral growl. You just have to hear that.<br />On successive listens other pieces of quality will begin to appear, like the playing of legendary death-metal guitarist James Murphy, or tight and inventive drumming (if I'm not mistaken, that's John's brother Donald behind the kits). The hardest thing about this album is telling where the track ends and the next one starts.<br />Few bands from Florida managed to put out a better death album. While I still think the succeeding Obituary's &quot;The End Complete&quot; is way better record.
B00005JLSE|5.0|I am writing this review for ME.  The problem as I read all of these reader reviews is really to know WHO SHOULD I BELIEVE ?  Some reviews say it is terrible!  Some are lukewarm... Some say it is great...<br /><br />I think there are people that hate musicals, and then they write a review about a great musical and slash it to pieces. I know people who hate Beethoven and hate Mozart, and I have to dismiss as irrelevant a review about the 9th Symphony written by somebody who hates classical music.<br /><br />So, writing about musicals, I can only believe somebody who loves musicals... and of course, that somebody is ME!  I love musicals.  I am my best musical critic, for me, because I really KNOW musicals!  I know which musicals I didn't like so much (Miss Saigon, Candide...) and which musicals I loved (Phantom of the Opera, My Fair Lady, Beauty and the Beast, King and I, Man of La Mancha, Fiddler on the Roof... Joseph...).  I have seen everything great, ten times or more, including The King and I, Man of La Mancha, Cats, Fiddler on the Roof, Evita, etc.... even Show Boat, The Mikado, Pirates of Penzance, Mary Poppins, etc....<br /><br />I mean... I REALLY KNOW and LOVE MUSICALS!  That having been said...<br /><br />After having seen Chicago on a big screen 3 or 4  times, maybe more... the verdict is: Chicago is Fabulous!  It is right up there with the best of them.  The songs are great, catchy, really excellent... The dancing is great, the singing is great, the coreography is beautiful... The actors are superb... Queen Latiffa, Richard Gere, Catherine Zeta Jones and Renee Zellweger are all so PERFECT for their parts... Catherine Zeta Jones won an Oscar for her role, and Richard Gere deserved to win an Oscar for his role (but he wins a long applause, from me.)  He actually SINGS his own songs. He is PERFECT for the part.<br /><br />And Catherine Zeta Jones... Wow!  SHE IS WONDERFUL!  Not only is she BEAUTIFUL, but she is TALENTED!  She REALLY DANCES... not just dances, she transcends into Jazz!  I was hooked on the music of Chicago for weeks...<br /><br />I love the tunes, the coreography... I love Chicago... it is without a doubt in the same league as the best musicals ever... by that I mean it is in the same league as the best of Rodgers and Hammerstein, Gilbert and Sullivan,  Andrew Lloyd Weber, etc.<br /><br />And now I write this for others: Buy this DVD!  This is really a bargain.  You only pay for it once, and you will have it and be able to see it many times and enjoy it for the rest of your life.<br /><br />P.S.: I bought the DVD... I have watched it many times, and each time I like it more... I know I will enjoy it many times more.
B0000013GT|5.0|I love this CD. I only bought it because it was a discounted price and it is one of the best albums I have ever heard. The beats are chillin', the lyrics are good, and it is the perfect album to listen to over and over. The Run-DMC style rapping on Wheels of Steel, the chorus and beat on Jazzy Belle, Dre's verses on Babylon... the list goes on.<BR>This is, by far, the greatest OutKast album, and close to my favourite album. BUY IT!
B00005JMTN|2.0|\\"Big Fish\\" is a chick flick about male characters.  Many will find this mixture of tall tale and reality, strangely unsatisfying in spite of competent acting performances turned in by Albert Finney, Billy Crudup, and Ewan McGregor.  The women are relegated to very minor roles and their characters are barely fleshed out.<br /><br />  The story of Edward Bloom, a \\"social person\\", and a storyteller who embellishes the truth at every turn.  The movie revolves around a series of flashbacks, some believable, others fantastical.  Bloom's son struggles to find the real man behind his father's ever-changing smokescreens; he wants to connect with his father while there is still time, before Bloom's terminal illness claims him.<br /><br />  \\"Big Fish\\" will doubtless fall into the \\"love it or hate it\\" category.  This reviewer did not find a great deal to love.
B000000WJZ|5.0|I will admit I am biased.  My fav band is SP although I'm not obsessed ;)  There will never be another band like these people.  Also get Siamese Dream if you don't have it!
0375751513|1.0|which is a waste of paper.  What makes me say that?  Could it be that the sins are too vague or too outdated?  No, I judged this book based on my enjoyment or lack of enjoyment in reading it.  Wit without substance, characters without passion, dialogue without reason.  I found myself reading other books just so I had an excuse not to continue reading this one.  In the end all I can say to truly show how I feel about this novel is that this book BORED me.  177 pages of art that is 'quite useless'.  The only reason I finished was because I hate to start a book then walk away and also I wanted to do review (and to do a review without finishing the book is unfair).
B0000035E7|1.0|This first attempt from Cobain and the gang is horrible. Raw, tuneless, amelodic, endlessly repetitive grunge trash. (&quot;Negative Creep&quot; is a perfect example. Hey, let's scream &quot;Johnny's little girl ain't a girl no more&quot; about ten zillion times, and call it a song.)<br />I actually like some of Nirvana's later stuff. But all in all, the grunge movement was a bust. Thank God it's all but gone now. It sure wore out its welcome fast. Now, back to constructing actual melodies and harmonies, OK?
B000001ESJ|2.0|One of the great unsolved mysteries of rock: how can the same album contain a song as great as \\"Xanadu\\" and a song as bad as \\"Cygnus X-1?\\"<br />\\"Xanadu\\" is indeed a brilliant composition: classically constructed and confidently played, it's my choice for Rush's best epic song ever (even ahead of \\"2112\\").  Drummer Neil Peart's lyrics paint an exquisite portrait of Kubla Khan's pleasure palace (with significant borrowing from Samuel Taylor Coleridge);  Geddy Lee manages to control his still-maturing voice enough to convincingly deliver the melody.  The band segues seamlessly from one unforgettable riff to another, with dramatic synthesizer parts stragetically sprinkled throughout.  It's 11 minutes of pure prog rock bliss; once it's over, you'll wonder where the time went.<br />The album contains another authentic Rush classic, \\"Closer to the Heart,\\"  a lovely 3-minute ballad that foreshadows the band's eventual trend towards shorter and more concise songwriting.<br />But the rest of this stuff!  After repeated listenings, I still cannot determine why \\"A Farewell to Kings\\" is so revered by hardcore Rush fans.  The longer tracks are as undisciplined and unfocused as \\"Xanadu\\" is tasteful and tight.  The most egregious example is \\"Cygnus X-1,\\" with shrill, screechly vocals by Lee and interminable, self-indulgent riffing by all three members.  Rush fans are going to kill me for saying this, but this track actually sounds worse to me with each listen.<br />\\"A Farewell to Kings\\" captures an extremely talented and ambitious band in a transitional phase, still unable to channel their virtuosity for the length of an entire album.  The record is definitely worth owning for \\"Xanadu\\" and \\"Closer to the Heart;\\" just watch out for the rest of the songs!
1400031362|5.0|This is the third book I've read in Mr. Smith's series about Botswana and, in my opinion, it's the best so far.  His writing style is beautiful, with great descriptions that take the imagination soaring.  I especially like the character development of Mme. Makutsi, newly promoted to Acting Manager of the garage as well as the detective agency.  She truly shines.  <BR>Highly recommended.
B00006SFBD|5.0|\\"Wreath\\" is an immediately attention-getting album opener.  Spanning over eleven minutes long, it is one of the heaviest tracks here.  There are whole sections of amazing melodies that brood in dark heaviness, UNBELIEVABLE death metal vocals from Mikael Åkerfeldt, and a great showcase for Martin Lopez's drumming.  A few greats solo in there...  In the middle of the song, the sound breaks down to a bongo-percussion with an almost folkish feel to it before the heaviness returns with a sizzling solo, after which are a few verses of growls alternating with luminescent singing...and then it gets quiet again, then heavy.  So complex, so perfect, so BRILLIANT!  <br />\\"Deliverance\\" - Starting off with melodic thrashes of heaviness and growling, the song quickly breaks in a wonderful transition into one of the most haunting and unbelievable experiences you'll ever hear in music, as acoustic guitars and leads drift up from the fading murk, and then Mikael begins singing.  \\"Walk with me...you'll never leave...wait to see...your spirit free...\\"  Then there is a quick burst of heaviness, and it breaks back into the beautiful gloom: \\"Tell me how...your heart's in need...as I drown...you in the sea.\\"  And then it returns to the heaviness.  There are so many sections of alternating beauty and alien evil throughout this song, it is as good as Opeth gets.  The lyrics seem to tell the tale of a man who finds out that his lover is pregnant (\\"Received no warning/ From nothing to a lifecode\\") and ends up drowning her...and soon it begins to dawn on him that he will not escape his deliverance: \\"Deliverance...thrown back at me...deliverance...laughing at me.\\"  Finally, it's almost 14 minutes long, with the last four minutes or so of amazing rounds of heavy beats with an amazing flourish.  This gets repeated about four times...a fantastic, powerful outro to a fantastic, powerful song.<br />\\"A Fair Judgment\\" starts off with a slow, melancholic piano intro, leading into a similarly-paced round of acoustic and electric guitar harmonies, with Mikael's haunting singing.  There are no death metal growls here; and while there are sections of great, sweeping heavier guitars at times, this song is far from heavy in all.  Great drumming from Martin Lopez, I might add.  About four minutes into the song, after a faded heavy section, is a great classical-sounding guitar, with a sort of fuzzy sound that gives an Autumnal feel, before resuming with more of the slow-paced harmonies and vocals, which continue for a few more minutes until we have a vocal solo over piano from Mikael, repeating the opening lines: \\"Losing sleep...in too deep...fading sun...what have I done...come so close...to what I need most...nothing left...\\" and then silence as he breathes: \\"Here...,\\" and then final, powerful, bleak metal riffs come in, fading slowly out.<br />\\"For Absent Friend\\" is the shortest track on this album (e.g. the only one under 10 minutes!), clocking in at a brief 2:17, but it is so perfectly placed, a nice little instrumental breather from the uber-heaviness and emotions of the other songs.  The little guitar leads over the carefully acoustic pickings are simply marvelous.  And then...<br />...THE BEAST RUMBLES OUT FROM HELL!  The next song, \\"Master's Apprentices,\\" is arguably the heaviest track on this entire album.  Featuring a pounding rhythm for the majority of the song, the guitars hammer down like a violent flurry of thunder and lightning, with frightening growls from Mikael.  In fact, although the jagged riffs are separated at times by brief but heavy melodies, the really beautiful stuff in this song doesn't start until over halfway into it, when Mikael's singing voice shines through like light at the end of a deep, long-forgotten tunnel, but this is quickly buried again by the death metal growls...there is a building melody, however - a brief solo that echoes out in a spacey manner - and the heaviness returns, building...and Mikael's singing returns, and - the heaviness just STOPS, and an unearthly transition into acoustic guitar strumming and more singing begins, carrying the listener into a blissful purgatory of swirling melancholy.  There is just nothing else that matches this transition, in any song, anywhere.  And in this peaceful (but sad) time, the vocals ring in harmonized, angelic tones, sucking the listener into an almost siren-like manner until - \\"PLUNGING INTO THE DEEPEST VOID DEPARTED SHELL LEFT DRAINED BEHIND!\\" the death vocals and eaviness return with a shebang, and quickly slay the light and beauty of just a moment before, and the song goes out in a beautiful, fading outro of mildly distorted guitars and solid percussions.  Ten and a half minutes of unrivaled progressive rock.<br />\\"By the Pain I See in Others\\" starts off with a blurry sound, almost like something visible just beneath an icy pond.  This something is an obviously fast-paced and heavy rhythm, and it immediately smashes up through that ice like a giant fist and gallops away, until a sudden transition to acoustic folk guitars and some ambient sounds blur in, with that same icy image as death metal vocals growl from beneath.  Then the song gets heavy again, continuing the growls, but quickly switches to a \\"Fair Judgment\\" kind of sweeping, melodic, but heavy guitars and a few terrific solos.  This whole cycle repeats again, and then fades into a synthesized sound that comes straight from a theme park or circus, and the vocals come in with such despair.  Icy keyboards flow in slowly over this, until it all stops, and a wall of heavy guitars and acoustic folk come in, before switching over to full heaviness and melody.  There are more of these eclectic - yet brilliant - transitions between heaviness and folk, and it is just best that you hear it for yourself.  And be sure to listen to what follows as a hidden track at around 12:00 into the song...it is something else entirely, and a great end to a great album.
B00009V8Z9|4.0|I think i will download this cd because i dont feel like paying for it but when its all said and done this cd it great
B0000VAFO0|3.0|Note: This is not an oscar worthy movie nor are the performances worthy of any golden globe. No way. No how. <br />Ok with that out of the way, what we do have here is an AWESOME KICK BUTT vampire vs werewolf flick that *yes steals from others* but don't all hollywood writers, producers and directors take a little bit from each other? So don't whine and complain. Kate Beckinsale as Selene was the perfect choice (even though she says no more than hmmm 20 sum words the whole movie) and Scott Speedsman is also perfectly cast as the poor smuck who gets bitten by one of the Leiken. The sets, the costumes, and the music (all in errie and bass thumping 5.1 dolby digital - DTS would've even been better - but thats ok) Overall regardless of a somewhat not really there story and very little dialogue this movie I highly recommend to anyone who enjoys a good popcorn movie that KICKS BUTT and will give your home theater system a serious work out! <br />THREE AND HALF STARS OUT OF FIVE!!
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I'm a Joss Whedon fan, and pre-ordered this long before its release.  I didn't think I could go wrong with Joss, despite it being cancelled in the US (and never having seen the screened episodes, being from Australia), and I was right. From the beginning, the production values and acting talent are of the highest quality.  However I almost dropped the rating back to 4 stars, because of a few relatively &quot;slow&quot; episodes where characters were being established, or too much time was spent on &quot;guns and horses&quot;, or where an episode's plot seemed too derivative of other old tv and movie cliches.  But then I realised I was being unduly harsh, judging Firefly against the impossibly high standards of Buffy.  Firefly fails to be as &quot;funny&quot; as Buffy often was, but gains ground for some of its audience by being more adult and much more morally ambiguous. On any objective measure, this show is easily in the top 10% and therefore a worthy &quot;5 stars&quot;.  I suspect the critics of this show didn't bother to see past a few of those cliches to perceive the strength of early character development and overall story arcs being established.  The seeds of several such arcs are clear and bulging with potential and it is frustrating to think that we may never see the fuller realisation of those ideas.  Although I understand a film is rumoured, and if the DVD release is successful then who knows.
B000069CWE|5.0|Oh my God, Linkin Park has done the impossible. They have made a good remix album. It's still not quite as good as the original but is not far off. The Cure for the Itch remix is absolutely amazing. Other good tracks are Points of Authority, Pushing Me Away, and especially My December.
B0000A98ZP|5.0|\\"The Breakfast Club\\" is on of the few brat-pack movies that really depict high school life. I love it for that, you meet stoners and weirdos and criminals and geeks and jocks and and and.... the list could go on for ever on how this film depicts each cliche. I love all of the actors, how each of them really get into the character and how they depict them (boy! I'm sure using the word depict alot today arent I?) This is a great movie for young people. I love it so much.<br />Five Kids are stuck in a painful saturday detention, a criminal, a jock, a geek, a prom queen and a weirdo gothic girl. As the day goes on they discuss controversal issues, such as sex before marrige, crime, drugs and politics and eithical stuff. When the day begins they hate each other don't trust each other and stereotype each other. But as the day goes on they talk and learn their strengths differences and rights and wrongs and they all change each others lives. There is a mean detention teacher that harasses them and is very cruel yet they stay strong.<br />The brat-pack kids were never expected to make a movie as good as this is. I was impressed, I'm a huge movie watched and I thought this was going to be just you know, swear drugs and bathroom humor. But it isn't its real life in real scenarios. There is strong language and drug content. So keep it away from the little ones. Perfect for anyone in high school. And look at the quote at the beginning of the movie
B00008H2LB|5.0|Wow. I never thought I'd like Linkin Park. But I went out and bought this CD anyways and I was amazed. Since then I've went out and bought Hybrid Theory and Reanimation.<br />Don't Stay (8/10) Probably my least favorite song on the CD. But it is still very good. <br />Somewhere I Belong (9/10) I never listened to this song at the beginning because it was so overplayed. But it grew on me and now I listen to it all the time.<br />Lying From You (9.5/10) A very polished song. Everything seems to go together.<br />Hit The Floor (9.5/10) The hardest song on the album but one of the best.<br />Easier To Run (8.5/10) Not one of my favorites but still great.<br />Faint (10/10) The reason I bought this CD. It very fast paced and is great to listen to in any mood.<br />Figure.09 (9.5/10) One of the better sounding tracks on the CD.<br />Breaking The Habit (9/10) A very diffrent sound from LP but it fits in well with the rest of the CD.<br />From The Inside (9/10) A great chorus and a great overall song.<br />Nobody's Listening (9/10) Another different sound from Linkin Park that ends up completing the CD.<br />Session (9.5/10) I can't believe so many people don't like this song. Definately one of my favs from the CD.<br />Numb (9/10) A great way to finish the album. It's a simple song but still good.
0385484518|5.0|&quot;Well Mitch, I want to talk to you about dying&quot; <br />This depressing/ happy story about a man who had graduated college and mindlessly driving around in his life not really happy but wanting something more, meets up with an ex-professor who is dying. I was very lost in my life and going through a difficult time when I read this. This book brought me up to spirits and trying to look at life in a new way. This book is for anyone that is willing to understand it, because younger audiences would not understand it at all because it discusses adult issues that you face. Nothing deathly inappropiate but just painful topics. <br />Mitch is graduating from college, and he is sad to leave his old professor Morrie. Morrie is a teacher, a goof, an senior aged kid and most of all a caring friend. Morrie tells Mitch not to be afraid to come visit him. That Mitch is a great guy with great potential. So Mitch says he will visit him and thanks for the compliments. Mitchgoes on wit his life and forgets about Morrie. He goes through numerous amounts of jobs. Gets a wife and just goes on, he seems empty, like somethings missing. Like he needs to do something with his life.<br />Meanwhile with Morrie, Morrie went on with life as well. But he has a disease thats killing him (I think it's cancer). So Morrie is trying to make due with the time he has left. He starts talking and preaching about life and how you should live life to the fullest. So he goes on a talk show, and coinceidently Mitch happened to be watching.<br />Mitch goes to his old professor and talks to him about how he is, whats happened since college. Then Morrie says I want to meet with once a week and talk about dying and life. So they decided to meet on tuesdays, they are both free on tuesdays. So their adventure begins with discovering the mysteries of life and death and just talking about stuff.<br />This book is enchanting, I loved it sooo much I read it again. I
B000002JSP|5.0|In Through the Outdoor is by far Led Zeppelin's most underrated album.  Fans of their earlier, riff driven masterpieces scoff at this release.  Although not many will go as far as calling it a down and out failure, many Led Zeppelin fans view is as a mediocre &quot;3 star&quot; release with not much to it.  I feel, however, that along with every other studio release, In Through the Outdoor deserves a five star rating... it is a great album.  It is still played repeatedly in my household, and I own it in LP, cassette and CD!  I admire Led Zeppelin for venturing into different directions.  In my opinion, they managed to grow in this album without sacrifycing the musical integrity of the material (unlike old farts like Aerosmith who have kept churning out crap after crap after a glorious 70's run).  If this album had been a rehash of their earlier stuff then I would have been dissapointed.  &quot;In the Evening&quot;, &quot;Fool in the Rain&quot; and &quot;All of my Love&quot; have their place amongst earlier classics. <BR>I had another friend who is a big Zeppelin fan admit to me recently that this is actually one of his favorite albums too.  For the longest times he resisted this album... dismissing it as the inferior output of an aging band.  However, over time, he says the music took him in.  It sounds nothing like Led Zeppelin too... but then again, Abbey Road sounded nothing like Meet the Beatles.
0792163710|5.0|Opening scene of the Tetons (which are a backdrop for the entire movie), a quail call and the deer in the garden have a resounding peace about them.  This movie has a personal touch that shows what a farmer might face in a West that was built around cattle.<BR>Joey's run and cry of Shane come back still brings back memories of the first time I saw the movie and as a 5 year old stood in the theater and started crying Shane come back at the top of my lungs.<BR>Jack Palance is the ultimate bad guy and Alan Ladd the handsome hero.  A a true good vs evil flick.
0345452577|3.0|Dr. Jeremy Carrier is a new character, perhaps a rework of Alex Delaware, before he had &quot;been there; done that.&quot;  He's young, idealistic and fairly inexperienced.  He's an orphan who got through school on scholarships against all odds.  His first real love is brutally murdered and at the beginning of the story he is trying to find his way after being suspected of having killed her.  A mystery doctor on staff at his hospital, Dr. Arthur Chess, drops into his life along with mysterious tips or clues leading him to look for Jocelyn's killer.  The story is slow and hard to follow.  The suspense finally picks up about half way through the book, and it's worth finishing.<br />Now that we have met Dr. Carrier, perhaps his next adventure will be a little more suspenseful and intense.
B00008OLIC|4.0|Motley had plenty of good pop/metal songs in the 80's. However, as with many bands, their studio albums were often cluttered with filler. Not so here.<br />In the late '80s, the band was going through its most destructive period - hard partying, drugs, girls - and it was beginning to catch up with them and endanger their lives, particularly Nikki Sixx, who literally came back from death after a drug incident. Finally, in 1989, they sobered up and it paid off, they also released their easily greatest album.<br />TNT -- The opener (with ER sounds and drums) is just a short lead in to the hit title track. A story of a druggie they call &quot;Dr Feelgood,&quot; this gutsy metal anthem amazingly made the Pop charts. And deservingly so.<br />Slice of Your Pie -- Slower, slightly bluesy hard rock with dirty lyrics. Not the best song, but far from bad.<br />Rattlesnake Shake -- Not to be confused with the Skid Row song of the same year. A more typical sounding uptempo hair metal anthem, but still great. Has a teeny bit of horn usage to make it unique.<br />Kickstart My Heart -- One of the best metal anthems ever. A tune about hard living (and possibly a bit autobiographical from Nikki's afforementioned story) with a slight pop tinge. If this doesn't get you pumped up, nothing will. Reminds me of Sammy Hagar's &quot;One Way to Rock.&quot;<br />Without You -- The mid tempo hit power ballad. A bit emotional and slower, but not the best hard rock ballad of this genre. Still good, it just feels a little lacking in some way.<br />Same Old Situation -- A supremely catchy, fun, anthemic minor hit. One of my favorites from them. Vince Neil recounts an, umm, 'female romance' involving two girls. No one who is even remotely a fan of hard rock should pass this song up.<br />Sticky Sweet -- Again, a turn toward the dirty blues/metal of &quot;Slice of Your Pie,&quot; but a little more uptempo and louder.<br />She Goes Down -- Another really dirty hair metal anthem. Very underrated.<br />Don't Go Away Mad, Just Go Away -- Here is my favorite on the album, and maybe from the band. Period. A hard edged, melodic anthem with a slight power ballad tinge, about just what it says. Very funny, too.<br />Time For Change -- An extremely underrated power ballad. The lyrics about poverty and kids in the street, are surprisingly touching. Even though Motley is a party band, this melodic tune proves they can be serious without sounding forced. A bit softer than the rest of the album, but it still rocks.<br />NEW TRACK.<br />Get it For Free -- This previously unreleased track is again a slightly bluesy anthem, which is a great addition, but doesn't top the original songs. It sounds a little more like something off the &quot;Girls&quot; album.<br />Basically, I always thought MC was a little heavier than your average hair band, and was a cross of more poppish bands like Poison and the rougher, heavy sounds of Guns &amp; Roses or Metallica. They were closest to Skid Row, or 80's Aerosmith. This album is a little more broad than you might expect, though.Don't Go Away Mad, Just Go Away -- Here is my favorite on the album, and maybe from the band. Period.

0375432302|1.0|I'm extremely surprised that such a mediocre (meaning BAD) writer as Dan Brown can have this type of publicity. Besides the fact that the story is full of clich&eacute;s and it basically does not make sense, Mr. Brown simply has no idea of how to write anything, let alone a book. I would strongly suggest him to read, I don't know, Borges, Umberto Eco, but the mere notion of having these authors associated with Brown is ridiculous. He should definitely find another line of work. This is one of the worst books I have read in my life.
0440178002|5.0|Shogun, by James Clavell, in my opinion is one of the greatest novels ever written.  All of the characters play an intricate part in this story, whether their piece of the plot is big or small.  There are several things that set Shogun apart from other novels, with the most intriguing being unpredictability.  You never know what will happen next, or who the bad guy really is.  It has a marvelous plot with one action-packed sequence following another.<br />One of the only weak points in Shogun is the abrupt ending.  It ends with man plot lines left unfinished, the aftermath of the book could be explained better; and if these were different, it would make the story more complete to the reader when they finish reading.  A paragraph at the end summarizes the fate of all the characters, it's not enough.  Another 1,000 pages could easily have been devoted to the &quot;aftermath.&quot;<br />The book is so absorbing that you just can't put it down, and you have a desire to finish it because you want to know what's going to happen next, but it's usually not what you think will happen.<br />Before I was even done with the first 100 pages, I was engrossed, completely.  I learned to love some characters and hate others.  Clavell's style of writing is unique and sometimes confusing, but he usually explained his ideas later in the book in greater detail.<br />The book is great, although it contains some themes that are rather mature, so I wouldn't recommend it to younger readers.
B0000029DD|5.0|OMG, one of the great tragedies of American Culture is the all-too early death of Jeff Buckley.  This is the perfect album to help you relax and get into a more introspective frame of mind after an exhausting day at Walt Disney World.  I can't listen to it while I'm driving because sometimes it makes me cry and then I can't see the road.<br />I personally hold myself responsible for his death because maybe, just maybe if I had called him to tell him how much I love him he wouldn't have had so much to drink that tragic night in his boat.
0783225792|4.0|&quot;Casino&quot; features much of the same cast as the excellent film &quot;Goodfellas&quot; with Joe Pesci and Robert DeNiro returning as gangsters, this time in Las Vegas.  This is the story of a mob-fronted casino boss and the local Mafia enforcer in Vegas.  The film truly takes us inside the seamier side of 1960s Las Vegas, which at that time was more or less openly controlled by the Midwestern mob bosses.  The film is practically a psueudo-documentary about how the mob ran Vegas.<br />Pesci and DeNiro turn in fine performances as enforcer and casino boss respectively.  James Woods does his customary excellent job as the worthless dissolute, but controlling boyfriend of De Niro's wife, Ginger.  The standout, however, is Sharon Stone as Ginger.  She literally becomes the role, and ultimately dominates the latter portion of the film.<br />The storyline is brisk, and the explanation of the workings of the Vegas mob are very interesting.  The film shows the ultimate pointlessness and wanton violence of the mob culture, as all of the major players ultimately come to bad ends.  The film never takes itself too seriously, and there are many absolutely hilarious parts to the film.  The sub-plot dealing with De Niro's attempt to get a casino license from the local Vegas good-old-boys is really funny.<br />Minor criticisms.  First of all, the film involves 'way more swearing than is necessary.  Yes, I have no doubt that mobsters really do talk this way, using the F-word every third word, as Pesci does throughout the film.  But it probably would have been OK to clean this up anyway--I think that to have done so would have added to, rather than detracted from, the movie's impact.  The violence throughout the film is such that it is not suitable for young kids.<br />Basically an excellent adult film that retains the viewer's interest, tells an interesting story, and features very fine performances by the cast.  Recommended for what it is.
B00006FDCD|5.0|Yes It is very different than the novel, but you can't compare the two.  One is aiming for the Movie viewers and  the other to the avid reader.  Good theme but a made for TV film so there's some cheesy Parts.  From a Movie Director to you, Enjoy!
B000002GQG|5.0|It was 1984 when I had my first stance in the US. I was quite young and troubled and very anxious to discover new things. I met my stepcousin who was a much more experienced musician than I was at that time and after breaking some initial ice with some friendly smoke we started sharing music and information about our fave bands.<BR>Among the stuff he showed one album made a major mark on my music approach, conception and taste and eventually came to be a lifetime influence: \\"In Search of the Lost Chord\\".<BR>This was a very explicit conceptual album with a clear beginning and a clear end and the inherent adventures in between.<BR>The almost perfect beauty of the arrangements, the touching melodies and the excellence of the production really caught my soul and that factory tape from my cousin remained inside my walkman for weeks.<BR>Voices in the Sky, The Actor, The Best Way to Travel, Visions of Paradise were for me true highlights of this production followed closely by the composition tricks of House of Four Doors and each room content, Legend of a Mind, Ride My SeeSaw and OM. <BR>The only one I was not too keen about at that time was the jumpy Dr. Livingstone I Presume which I purposedly cancelled from the tape to tape copy I made for my use.<BR>As me and my friends were really into the 77 punk thing among other classic and heavy stuff and avant garde/industrial bands,every once in a while I use to get a hard time from them because of this record that was found too cheesy or too much of a \\"softie\\" to their standards, I never gave a damm thing about it. <BR>To me it was and still is a great, great album.<BR>Some years later my tape was totally worn out and I gladly discovered a vinyl which was in very poor condition inside of a vault. I did my best to restore it, then record it on tape and eventually my loyalty to this record was fully rewarded when some time later I found a remastered gold cd edition at a ridiculous price in a clearance bin. The guy at the store could not believe it as well.<BR>This one of the records that I would look to replace right away in case of loosing it and if you are into collecting concept/trip albums this is a must to have, listen to it and tell me later.
0385720920|5.0|This is definitely my favorite book by palahniuk so far. It beats out \\"Invisible Monsters\\" because of its ending. There is nothing to cure the aluminum aftertaste of the modern day void like a new book by Mr. Palahniuk. His quirky characters are easy to fall in love with and his way of telling a story makes you think: How does he know all this stuff? a plus is his incredible perversive mind that plays with the reader and make you choke with suprise halfway through the book. Love his stories about sexual addiction support groups
0375432302|1.0|(1)If your Roman Catholic like I am, DON'T read this book. If your a devout Christian like I am,DON'T read this book. This book in its entirety is anti-Christian, anti-pope,and a &quot;twisted&quot; history in it. Dan Brown,whose name sounds like a hundred bells ringing, writes a &quot;true-false&quot; book; he has some truth about some of the things in this book but, he puts some &quot;made-up&quot; things in there too.<br />(2)The plot itself is wrong also. The clymax comes right after the first two pages and stays there for eight more pages.<br />It is a shame the a newley discoverd author (Dan Brown) would makes such a false book.<br />P.S. The star I put for the rating is for the publishers. I work for them.

B0000AXE8I|4.0|When i saw the first matrix my mind was blown away. So i knew i had to see the second one.It has great special affects and the scene on the highway will keep you at the edge of your seat.This movie is about saving the last of human kind so it is not exactly always on Neo but he does play a huge role in this movie as the last. The only thing about this movie i dislike is that Neo is alpowerful and no one can beat him. Unlike the first and third where smith is stronger. Personally this is my least favorite of the trilogy but it is still a great movie.(Revolutions is my favorite and the original is second). But thats just my opinion. To see what yours is you'll just have to see the movie.
0812550706|5.0|I came across this book in the Middle Eastern desert during Operation Iraqi Freedom.  This book was on the Untied States Marine Corps Commandant's Reading List and handed to me by my lieutenant.  During lulls in operations, I would read this book.  It kept me hooked, so much so that I carried it in my cargo pocket every where I went. The concept was fresh, the characters interesting, to the point I wish I wrote it myself.  The only problem I had with the book was the ending which I didn't too much like, but it's still a good read.  Upon completion, I did the Marine thing and passed it to one of my young non-comissioned officers to read.  I am looking forward to learning more about the character Bean in Ender's Shadow!!  Get this book, you won't be disappointed.
0385504209|3.0|I have mixed feelings about this book.  None of the \\"revelations\\" are new, but I enjoyed the story and found it to be a page-turner.  The one thing that sticks in my craw is that Brown has equated the possible marriage of Jesus with sex cults and pagan worship.  This doesn't fly, in my opinion.  I have no qualms about accepting a married Jesus, but nothing points to his own carrying on of ancient sex rituals and the like.  It seems Brown was attempting to tie in too many things.
B00009V7P8|5.0|Unlike some contributors, I don't believe Damien changes the world, or walks on water, or has the cure for cancer in his back pocket, but - and it's a big, emphatic, joyous 'but' - I've listened to this CD more than any other over the past 12 months and every time I listen, I'm not just impressed but, you know, moved. I was on holiday, listening on my Walkman, lying by the pool, and one harmony between Damien and Lisa - the bit where they both sing 'time, always time' on Older Chests - rather unexpectedly, even after about 50 listens, literally stirred every cell in my body. The whole album is quietly, evocatively, insidiously magical and wondrous. I'm Irish, and in a sense that usually turns me against, rather than onto, local heroes (small countries tend to overhype modest talents) but Damien transcends all that. His music connects immediately, seduces effortlessly and, at a primeval level, just makes me want to exult in the joys, and pitfalls, of everday life. It's not usually my type of music, but it has become an essential, almost daily, listen. It's languidly beautiful, achingly emotional, endlessly rewarding - take a tip, buy it.

B0000DJZA5|5.0|Let It Be and The Long And Winding Road are superior in this version! The album reflects the studio scenes depicted in the original album.

0385484518|5.0|What can I say about this book that hasn't been said before? After reading Albom's Five People You Meet in Heaven a friend gave me his Tuesday's With Morrie. It was truly life-changing! When experiencing suffering firsthand or seeing a loved one suffer we begin to learn lessons that would otherwise go unlearned i.e. that life is so much more than food, clothing, appearance, sex, entertainment, sports, health, intelligence, money, houses, cars, degrees, jobs, status, etc. Most, if not all of these supposed `necessities', as Albom reiterates are nothing more than pure distractions like Solomon once said `All is vanity' (Eccl. 1:2). This obsession with hedonism and materialism in our Western world never has and never will bring satisfaction. It will only steal and waste our valuable time like waves tossing with every wind that could be better spent with loved ones and more importantly with God. Jesus once said `It is more blessed to give than to receive' (Acts 20:35) and Morrie declares likewise. Give what you can to others of yourself and time, to your spouse, children, family, friends, church, community etc. for indeed a man's no fool who gives what he can never keep to gain what he can never lose! I've learned from this book that life is not about getting all one can out of others, far from it! Life is about giving one's all for others. And I guess that unless we learn some of the valuable lessons Morrie emphasised in his last days and begin to really live life as He meant it to be lived and not misuse or abuse it or take it for granted it may require God to give us all a good shaking up.
B00005JMEW|5.0|Okay, there is absolutely no need to tell any more about Vol. 1's plot unless you've just jumped down here without looking at the top reviews. Anyway, Tarantino's most recent BIG project was Kill Bill, a two-hour epic of blood and hate. From the opening credits to the final cliffhanger, this flick has Tarantino written all over Uma Thurman's triangularly shaped forehead. He's resurrected his trademarks like the jumpy time sequence, very deep morals found only between the lines, crime bosses, that kooky dialogue we've all come to know and love, and even some newer tricks have come out of his sleeve like the amazing anime sequence and homage to even more obscure film genres we've never heard of. <br />There is, of course the issue of violence and gore associated with this film. Anybody who can laugh at Monty Python's infamous Black Knight scene can cope with it but even still will be shaking their heads in a mix of emotions somewhere between sheer horror and pure hilarity. One scene within the climactic battle scene was even purposely put into black and white in order to keep an R rating. Overseas in countries used to that level of ferocious death, like Japan in particular, it was shown in full bloody color, while if seen over here by our children's minds the entire project would've had an NC-17. It's truly a shame when true art can't be expressed to the world in its full glory (or whatever you'd personally want to call it). Another problem about the film is the cutoff in the middle of the script. Howard Stern said that he would've loved to see it in its complete four-hour length, and even though salivating can be good I'm a little tired of waiting after this many months. <br />Still, despite the little concerns, this is a fantastic movie. And yet, there is a certain magic about it that's almost impossible to explain. From the deep benevolent yearning to pick up The Bride and cuddle her with her bloody teeth, to the way you can truly relate to those times when hate has surged through your body like a powder keg as it does hers, you can feel this movie. Not in a Braveheart sort of way with naught but bagpipes to carry the emotion, but in a true and real way. Uma Thurman's already been nominated for a Golden Globe in this. Hopefully she'll win and when the next installment (which will completely outdo the first, I already cheated and looked at the screenplay) comes around I'll be the first in the theater for the midnight showing. And oh yeah, buy the DVD.
B0000026UV|4.0|I've been a fan of both Mark Knopfler and Chet Atkins for quite some time and when I saw this album, I bought it. It's a great album and the music is very much Chet Atkins-style. My biggest complaint about the album, though, is that the first song was mixed very badly: the drums were too loud and the vocals were not loud enough. The song has a strikingly similar sound to &quot;Walk of Life&quot; too. My only other complaint is that it only has 10 tracks on it. Other than that, it's a superb album and I would recommend it to anyone who is a MK or Chet Atkins fan.
B000002KFJ|5.0|I am a huge Iron Maiden fan, and I am into &quot;classic&quot; metal (my defintion: Dio,Sabbath,Maiden, early Metallica) amongst other styles of music.  I used to avoid this particular album for what ever reason.  I love Sabbath Bloody Sabbath and Black Sabbath, but just could not get into this one.  Well Oz Fest came my way and rekindled my taste for heavy sludge.  So, back to the Cd shelf I went and randomly pulled Sabotage out.  Wow!!! It hit me like a ton of bricks (sorry for the cliche').  Maybe time was all I needed to absorb this metal masterpiece (much like Maiden's X-Factor album).  That said, it is my favorite Black Sabbath album and when friends tell me they think Paranoid is the best I tell them to pick up Sabotage.  So for those of you who don't like it, put it on the shelf and pull it out in a month or two when your ready, and you'll see how much you love this album.
B00006879E|5.0|I first heard this CD from my boyfriend and I immediately loved it. Every song combines so many artistic, musical elements. It's upbeat but still has that rock edge to it. The lead singer, Adam Levine, has a very captivating voice, and it combines perfectly with the groove-based guitar melodies. The CD includes slower ballads as well as in-your-face rock tunes. The diversity is great, and the band still manages to keep their style throughout the whole album. This band has quickly become one of my favorites!
0780020685|5.0|Why is this film so great? What sets it apart from those countless other &quot;classic&quot; samurai flicks involving feudal japan and its daimyo's and geisha? Many things. First off, it is directed by Akira Kurosawa, one of the directors hailed by Lucas, Spielberg and others as inspiration for their films (Star Wars being one). The story begins. We see a village distraught because it is being marauded by a band of savage bandits. Destruction seems to be coming. The village's only chance is to have samurai protect it. But that's a slim chance. <br />Until a man is seen shaving his head, posing as a preist to save a hostage victim from a crazed bandit hiding in a shed. Many think this was the beginning of the &quot;scene&quot; in which has nothing to do with the later plot. I wouldn't doubt it. This man is taken as the Samurai leader. And agrees to protect the village. For rice.<br />Heres where some turn away from this film. Some wonder why a samurai would protect a village with little to no pay. Here's where some knowledge of Japan must be known. Samurai will take any job, it is their nature. It seems to be almost masochistic as the bandits keep attacking after repeatedly losing men towards the end of the film.<br />Why is this film rated with only four and a half stars? It is, I feel the best movie of all time. Many critics, including Roger Ebert, agree. <br />So, what is it you say? Why is the movie so special? I think it is the characters that set it apart. This movie shows the most brilliant character development I have ever seen in a film. Every perfomance is memorable. Especially Toshiro Mifune's, playing as the lazy-romantic Kikuchiyo. TAkashi Shimura's performance as the group's leader is also very memorable. <br />The audience feels a certain euphoria when watching the characters. They laugh and cry all at the appropriate times. They scream with the intensity we all know. The hate you feel when protecting some thing you care for. I would argue that this movie shows the best acting in a film since films have been around. Its so amazing, so astounding, that one feels they are there, and despite the film being in black and white, can feel the colors of life through the characters..<br />Its really indescribable how touching the movie is. Some have called it sadistic, but it brings about a really good moral. A lesson. That some things must move on, and the hero's aren't always the one's that save the day...<br />My rating: 5 stars. Best film ever made.
0385504209|3.0|The Da Vinci Code is a good story. If it had been better written it could have been a great book. However, to my mind, the author took a deep subject and glossed over so much interesting material, it felt as though he were writing a screen play. I could almost see Harrison Ford reprising his Nevada Jones role with a shallow, red headed bimbo instead of a blond one. That isn't fair to the female character who is, of course, brilliant as well as beautiful. Since the book is all about the female as a religious power it seemed a poor way to treat the female protagonist.<br />  It really is a good story. The author has taken an arcane subject with numerous dimensions and woven a good tale. He has a good imagination. Unfortunately, he is not a good enough writer to turn his good story into a great book. His characters are flat and pretty much the usual fare. It could have been a Harry Potter, Lord of the Rings, probably much better. These books use a lot of the same imagery and historical/mystical metaphor. Nicolas Flamel, who invented the Philosophers Stone in Harry Potter, turns out to have been a one time Grand Master of the Knights Templar or Priory of Sion from 1398-1418. Other Grand Masters were Botticelli, Da Vinci and Isaac Newton.<br />  I was disappointed, after all the hype, but what else is new? Dan Brown turned a fascinating subject into a glossy bit of frippery and left an ending that is clearly designed to allow for a sequel.
B000069CWE|5.0|Linkin Park's \\"Reanimation\\" is a remarkable CD. Many people I know said they wouldn't buy it because they assumed it was just a collection of extended, watered-down versions of their originals. Untrue. Each song is completely unique from it's parent, often times barely resembling it. With each song they took it to the next level, sometimes rerecording/rewriting the entire vocal or rap section to make it different from the original. \\"Pushing Me Away\\" comes to mind as a great example of this. So there's the first thing - this is not just a pale reflection of \\"Hybrid Theory\\"; it's completely fresh takes on the songs, including some previously unreleased cuts only available to LP fan club members.<br />Although they used a dozen different producers throughout the CD it has an amazing continuity to it. The same melodic string and piano motifs appear throughout each recording, connecting it in a surreal way. There is only one production that seems out of place to me, and it's on the worst possible song - \\"In The End.\\" This was their biggest hit from \\"Hybrid Theory\\" and fans were expecting more out of it than any other cut on the record (at least I was). They destroyed it. The producers gave the song a shuffle feel and laced it with the \\"yo-yo-yo\\" street thing, rather than the more rapcore attitudes that permeate the rest of \\"Reanimation.\\" Terrible.<br />Fortunately, though, the rest of the CD shines. This may be the first record, with the exception of \\"Hybrid Theory,\\" that utilizes the newest technology for the good of music, not for the worse of it. Here's a brief explanation. <br />Music is done entirely on computers today. There is no more tape. Only hard drives. We can now work with music in a similar way that a writer works with a word processor - just cut and paste. The result has been the demise of music. We now have tools of unbelievable power, undreamt of only ten years ago, yet the quality of music has steadily gotten worse. Why? Because the tools are so powerful and simplified that unqualified musicians can now use them. Performances can always be \\"fixed later\\" so a good performance doesn't really matter anymore. The vocals can be tuned, the drums can be put in time - not need to waste precious studio time on perfectionism. That's if you're lucky enough to be in a studio. Most of these systems are in the producer's house, which brings us to the second reason for demise - location. We no longer need 84 channel consoles and racks upon racks of outboard gear. It's all in the computer. Anyway, I'm going off a little too much. The point is, music quality is declining because enormous power is now in the hands of people who aren't qualified to have it.<br />Linkin Park, however, has used this power for good. They've managed to use it to produce new sounds we've never heard before and to overall improve the quality of their sounds. On \\"Reanimation\\" the editing is used as an instrument as much as anything else.<br />Make sure to stick with every song because they often turn midway through into some new, amazing section. Track 7 comes to mind as a production with a less interesting first half that ends up providing the best moment on the album in the outro. If you liked \\"Hybrid Theory\\" I can't imagine you wouldn't love \\"Reanimation.\\"
B00007BH3Y|5.0|I watched this movie and instantly fell in love with the music.  I just had to purchase the soundtrack.  This music is so soothing, yet sad, and even joyful at times.  I listen to it when I'm working and it sort of takes my mind off all the stress of the day.  I could listen to it over and over.  Very good selection for those of you who greatly appreciate the sounds of classical music.
B0000VAFO0|4.0|The movie is actually better then I thought it would be and that is saying a lot. A movie consisitng of actual plot devices and characterization as well as characters that actually posess an IQ higher than 10, I must say that I am relieved. However the movie does have its draw backs. It tends to get the Romeo and Juliet/Ethan Frome feel and the clothes and weapons are Matrix rip offs. Otherwise the movie is excellent. With real dialoge, a plot, twists and turns, as well an opening for a sequel the movie is given four stars.
B000002B1M|5.0|With only his second formal contribution to the rap scene, Nasir manages to vividly recreate the world of gangsters and murders, the political arena of his age, as well as a world of hope, and all in one tidy bundle of ill rhymes, an incredible vocabulary and a deeply analytical intellect. His unique flow calls for nothing more than admiration, respect no doubt, and has sparked an endless trail of 'wannabe' rappers attempting carbon copies of his inimitable material. Illmatic blazed, sparkled, shimmered, and shocked when it first appeared. General opinion has it that no future Nas production could possibly have reproduced that debut effort. But indeed every Nas release since 1995 has superceded its antecedent. Illmatic is no more than an introduction, an hors d'ouevre to the unparalleled talent Nas displays. It Was Written, I Am...,Nastradamus, Stillmatic, The Lost Tapes, God's Son - each is a masterpiece in its own right and the succession of titles shows an evolution of style, form, production and certainly of wisdom. Each boasts Nas at his best - the best of his kind, the best of his age, the best to ever grace the hip hop field.
B000089RVR|2.0|Having an epically successful debut is always good, but is extremely stressful when the artist comes around to record another album. This is the case for Dido, who almost disappeared into the discount bins with her debut album, until Eminem sampled her song on \\"Stan\\" and launched her into multi-platinum status, so much so that No Angel became the best selling album for a British female artist ever, which is a big feat considering the fact that Britain is home to many legendry divas such as Annie Lennox.<br />No Angel catered to an era thriving for the chill-out mood turning clubs into lounges.  Hits such as \\"Here With Me\\" and \\"Thank You\\" have become staples of this decade. This sophomore effort, Life For Rent, is the ultimate test that will determine if Dido has the stuff of a legend.<br />Life For Rent opens with the single \\"White Flag,\\" which has already become a video favorite, featuring David Boreanaz, of Angel fame, as her love interest. The song meanders between average and bland.<br />The album is no exception as other tracks drift into acoustic mildness and low-tempo dreariness, like the very indifferent \\"See You When You're 40\\" and the aptly titled \\"Stoned.\\"<br />The only highlights of this full-lengther are the optimistic \\"Sand In My Shoes\\" and the tasty closer \\"See The Sun.\\"<br />Life For Rent starts with a determination to create melodic mysticism but ends up delivering middle-of-the road dullness.
B000001F95|5.0|How good is this soundtrack by Mark Knopfler?  Well, the movie (and it was a good little movie) came and went 19 (!) years ago, yet the CD continues to play over and over again here in my home.  It's a beautiful, haunting set of instrumentation and melody, combining Knopfler's outstanding musical talents with his study of traditional Irish music.  The result:  hours and hours of re-listenable, never-tiring pleasure for your ears.<br />Even if you've never heard of the film, this is a soundtrack well worth picking up.
B00005RFAI|2.0|Pink is getting blonder. Evidently the bleach washed out some of her pizzazz. She returns with her second album &quot;Missundaztood,&quot; which falls victim to the sophomoric slump.<br />Breaking into the scene with her attitude-driven man-chiding hit &quot;There You Go,&quot; Pink seemed to have the goods - a punky persona with pop hits. However, after enough exposure Pink comes off as more of a spoiled brat rather than a rebel with a cause.<br />&quot;Missundaztood&quot; contains the faceless, bland &quot;Get The Party Started,&quot; a song that proves that you don't have to be creative or even talented to please radio.<br />The new release strays from her debut in the sense that there is less bitchiness and more popstar dilemma. She expresses her battle with narcissism on &quot;Don't Let Me Get Me&quot; or attempts to seek insight in &quot;Family Portrait.&quot;<br />There is a noticeable shift in style from throw down beats to rockier moods - most probably because 4 Non-Blonde Linda Perry contributed to the penning of 8 of the 14 tracks including the catchy, yet directionless &quot;Missundaztood&quot; and &quot;Respect.&quot; Perry is also featured on the song &quot;Lonely Girl.&quot;<br />Pink meanders into manufactured rock in all the wrong directions. First with the road-trippy &quot;Just Like A Pill&quot; and secondly on the sorry &quot;18 Wheeler.&quot; Her lyrical abilities are not the sharpest. Even compared to her debut, this release falls short in the lyrical aspect.<br />The mayhem does not stop, especially when Pink duets with rock god Steven Tyler on the soulish &quot;Misery&quot; - if it had soul in the beginning, it lost it towards the end.<br />The only track that has clever arrangements is the slow-tempo &quot;Dear Diary.&quot; It floats without over-production.<br />&quot;Numb&quot; is a track that is heavy on rock arrangements, probably too heavy for a pop offering.<br />The album closes with &quot;My Vietnam.&quot; A song about what her father taught her and how she relates to it - an aim at integrity that falls without reaching the point.<br />Being the TRL bunny that she is, Pink doesn't really have to work all that hard to watch obnoxious teenagers scream her name on TV. She has the image, a powerhouse for a record company behind her and a pop star attitude. She is definitely not as fascinating as the other girls.<br />Pink can't dance like Britney, sing like Christina or be as charismatic as Nelly Furtado. Out of all the newcomers out there, Pink faces stiff competition. &quot;Missandaztood&quot; won't be helping her win the race.er taught her and how she relates to it - an aim at integrity that falls without reaching the point.<br />Being the TRL bunny that she is, Pink doesn't really have to work all that hard to watch obnoxious teenagers scream her name on TV.

B00005JMCN|5.0|I got this DVD because my family was wanting to see the movie.  I am not interested much in Horse Racing and the story of Seabiscuit just didn't grab me.  <br />I am so glad we got the movie.  This is wonderful.  It's a tad on the sappy side as far as the actual story telling goes, but that doesn't interfere at all with the movie at all.  The performances by all characters is superb and the photograph is awesome.  The director has some very interesting style when it comes to explaining plot lines just with the camera.  Very nicely done.<br />I have always been a Jeff Bridges fan and he comes through like always.  The same can be said of all the actors.  <br />I have to say that all of my family were in agreement.  The show was highly entertaining from start to finish.
B00008S2VG|5.0|Madonna returns, as she always does so shrewdly, with &quot;American Life.&quot; This time around she is more political and more self-conscious. But if you thought &quot;Ray Of Light&quot; was too experimental than you are in for a ride. While &quot;Music&quot; was a fluffier and poppier album, &quot;American Life&quot; makes Bjork sound MOR. The first single with its controversial pulled video starts the album with a boost and a confident mark.<br />But then you are treated with the best track on the album titled &quot;Hollywood,&quot; a song about superficiality and the other head of glitz and glam. Mirwais, Madonna's co-producer on this album, masterminded the sometimes acoustic sounding ambiance of the album detailed in &quot;Nothing Fails&quot; and &quot;X-Static Process.&quot; However, this heavily electronic release contains a folk aspect - almost inventing a new genre. This electro-folk sound is not an ordinary one, it is confusing in its melody, yet satisfactory as a whole. Remember the first time you heard the intro of &quot;Don't Tell Me,&quot; and you thought your CD was scratched but then you grew to love that song? Yeah, that kind of sound.<br />&quot;Love Profusion&quot; seems to be single-ready and this album also contains the James Bond theme song &quot;Die Another Day.&quot;<br />&quot;American Life&quot; is a genuine article of music. Speaking of the mainstream, there is nothing like it out there, unless you think of what Jewel would yodel up after a couple of electric shocks. This might be another &quot;Erotica&quot; - an album that is beautifully crafted but fails to achieve hige commercial success because of its rawer and edgier approach. Great art was never appreciated by the masses, anyway. Furthermore, this time around she is less of a lover and more of a fighter. &quot;American Life&quot; sees the modern-day goddess question her own spirituality, tackled issues of familial relations - as in the deliciously unique &quot;Mother And Father&quot; - and dissect life and celebrity. All of Madonna's recent releases have been about her self-discovery. This is an album that records the evolution of a legend.ot; - and dissect life and celebrity.

B000002JPA|2.0|After reading most of these reviews, I decided that the view of a non-fan might be more helpful to those who are not already familiar with this band.<BR>I was introduced to Dream Theater by an ex-girlfriend who, like the band, is classicaly trained herself. <BR>As she would play particular tracks of various records, she would explain to me why certain solos or certain arrangements were particularly amazing. But with every listen, I would just get frustrated at the overall blandness of the music.<br />There is no doubt that these musicians are virtuoso players. With the exception of their lead singer, whose singing style I find forced and reminiscent of 80's big hair hard rock, I have great respect for these guys as technicians. One listen of just about any one of their songs is ample proof of their note mastery.<BR>Ultimately, though, the sum of their parts is far less than the whole. <BR>Listen to each instrument individually and you're left with your mouth open. But as songs, they just don't click; they lack the cohesion and feeling that make a song work as a song, and not as a technical exercise with lyrics. It sounds like each instrumentalist is just trying to one-up each other, with more speed more notes and more scales. Czerny would be proud.<BR>It's not that their music is awful, there are a couple of songs here and there that I liked. But not enough to ever buy any of their records. Their music lacks feeling and soul.<BR>For those of you into prog-rock, you've probably already heard of Dream Theater and are familiar with their music. If you are an academic looking for obscure arrangements, this might work for you as well.<BR>But for people who are not fans if this type music, want something to simply listen to and are wondering whether or not to buy, I would advice you to sample a few tracks before you go and buy one of their albums. Who knows you may end up appreciating their music.<BR>I tried hard to like them, but never did no matter how often I tried.<BR>Speed doesn't necessarily make for great music, one only needs to listen to the great blues guitarists to see that. Or if you insist, check out some classical guitar to hear technical virtuosos playing with feeling.<BR>This group will never be timeless.

B00006LLLN|5.0|AKUS Live :Alison Krauss, Jerry Douglas, Dan Tyminski, Ron Block and Barry Bales shed a ray of hope for us all in this new release. A visionary band in many ways. The driving backbeat energy of \\"Choctaw Hayride\\" reminds me of a futuristic Bluegrass train pulling me along for a wild ride. Ron's Faraway land is prophetic in its vision and simplicity. \\"The Boy who wouldn't Hoe Corn\\" makes a statement of what the Bluegrass tradition is all about and its ability to speak in many ways. \\"Tiny Broken Heart\\" is a new favorite of mine and how once again bluegrass tradition can make a statement for today's world. \\"Bright and Sunny South\\" says it all with Dan's vocal clarity in all its best. Alison's vocals on \\"Stay\\" speak directly to you as a long lost friend would. All in all, their ability to mix vision, bluegrass backbeat and energy is what makes them trully special among today's bands. Highly recommended...Five BIG stars.
B00005OM4N|3.0|She is living the American dream. Born in Hicksville, Britney Spears became a member of the Mickey Mouse club, had a skyrocketing pop career and is in love with one of the most eligible bachelors in the world - of course she is the center of hatred.<br />However, is that to say that Britney is an overshadowed talent? Yes and no.<br />\\"Britney\\" opens with her most recent smash \\"I'm A Slave 4 U,\\" which is the catchiest the diva-in-training has ever been. However, the mastermind behind the throw-down beats of the sexy track is none other than the Neptunes, who are responsible for artist Kelis' impressive debut effort. Merging Britney's rather ailing vocal range with R&B pop songs is, surprisingly, not a failure.<br />The Neptunes also produce another standout track on the album - \\"Boys.\\" This song has a convertible-cruisy feel. Of course the lyrics are a nursery rhyme gone wrong, yet the urban beats make it deliciously edible, if not the highlight.<br />Then you get to the part were Britney attempts to replicate other artist's songs. \\"Anticipating\\" sounds like a drunken-karaoke version of Janet Jackson's overplayed \\"All For You.\\"<br />Later on, Britney steals a rap bass line for \\"Bombastic Love.\\" But the complete disgust comes when she covers Joan Jett and the Blackhearts' \\"I Love Rock 'n' Roll.\\" The result is a sorry attempt at credibility. You need true attitude to carry that tune. She should've learned that from her last album when she turned the Rolling Stones' racy \\"Satisfaction\\" into pure and utter sleaze. Don't mess with the classics, lil' Brit.<br />Spears, who proudly boasts about her partial writing credits on this release, sings about the tumultuous life of being a poor little 19-year-old billionaire.<br />\\"Overprotected\\" is her way of stealing the car when her parents aren't around and \\"Lonely\\" is her plea on being a hormonal teenager - not exactly Alanis when it comes to penning numbers. Still, the sound is danceable.<br />All this comes to an end when Britney leaves the schmaltzy pop tunes that she does best and meanders into gross ballads to show that although shallow, she is deep.<br />\\"I'm Not A Girl, Not Yet A Woman,\\" the next single, works better than putting your finger down your throat. Britney is the queen of sap. Her crooning is even worse than on \\"Lucky\\" and \\"Sometimes\\" combined.<br />I do not expect her to burst into something as consequential as Joni Mitchell's \\"Big Yellow Taxi,\\" but with all the green she makes selling pre-schoolers T-shirts and posters, she could've at least paid for an actual lyricist's assistance. But that does not seem to be her priority.<br />\\"Britney\\" is saved when she returns to upbeat with the skip-hop of \\"That's Where You Take Me\\" and the staccato \\"What It's Like To Be Me,\\" a song co-written with her boyfriend Justin Timberlake.<br />There is an extra serving of R&B on this one, without the soul. The good thing about Britney is that although she sticks to the most generic pop templates, she can bust a move that will give a rather average dance song a facelift.<br />This album is like other Britney albums - it has infectious dance uppers and dreadful downers. She is not a good vocalist or a gifted songwriter. Her talent is in her dancing, which is why most her songs make sense only after you see the video clip.<br />You might not want to listen to \\"Britney\\" after a long hard day at work, but fortunately you can always dance to it.Britney leaves the schmaltzy pop tunes that she does best and meanders into gross ballads to show that although shallow, she is deep. <br />\\"I'm Not A Girl, Not Yet A Woman,\\" the next single, works better than putting your finger down your throat.

B0000E1ALR|3.0|In life there are letters and postcards. For those who have ignored Springsteen letters (full albums) he offers the casual fans these postcards from his career. As a seasoned veteran from the wars of rock superstardom, Bruce has traveled both near and far and has amassed quite a war chest of postcards. The Essentials Collection of these \\"greetings\\" are presented here in a handy 3 CD set for both casuals and hardcore fans alike. Of course the dedicated tramps that have been reading his letters for 30 years now will mostly be interested in the bonus CD of rare oddities from the road. The others will have to settle for mere glimpses to the mans greatness by mulling over his more popular hits and misses from a legendary career. What cannot be overlooked is that part of his greatness is the completeness and coherence of his individual albums. Extrapolating songs from a greater work of significant artistic value renders this set of \\"essential\\" tracks as being out of context. In short, his complete albums are far more enjoyable than a greatest hits compilation. As a life long fan I can only hope these snippets of songs will lead the casual fan to his complete works. Having said that I'm more than perplexed over the bonus CD for the lifers that make up the lions share of his fan base. Clocking in at a paltry 47 minutes I have to wonder if the real tramps have been well served for their years of dedication. Some have expressed anger towards any criticism of Bruce so I'm sure to raise an eyebrow or two but please have an open mind. There is such a thing in life called \\"being taken for granted\\" and I believe the sub par characteristics of this and the Barcelona DVD may put the hard cores in the unfamiliar territory of \\"being taken for granted\\" by Bruce. Some have expressed that he doesn't owe us a thing and that we should be grateful for anything he chooses to release. I can't imagine that position in any other aspect of life so why should it be deployed here after paying goodmoney for these releases. For the money paid we are owed a professional product. The problems here are well documented so I won't review them but I take issue with Bruce fans that find it reprehensible for fans who are objective and honest towards his projects that are not of the highest quality.
B00006JJ1O|3.0|You thought Britney Spears was scandalous in a schoolgirl uniform? Then you're in for a ride. How about two Russian girls in school uniforms making out in the rain, which happens to wet their shirts to transparency?<br />Well, that is what the new East European duo t.A.T.u.'s new video looks like. The song \\"All That She Wants,\\" from their album \\"200 km/h in the Wrong Lane,\\" is conquering the charts and they are quickly becoming a new sensation.<br />Their hit song is as catchy as something Ace of Base would have released mid-'90s, but the technique here is the marketing master plan that makes those two girls noticeable, brought to you by the same record label that aided the rise of Eminem.<br />Many questions come into mind about this Russian duo -- are they porn stars who got a contract? Professional lesbians?<br />Neither Lena Katina nor Julia Volkova has any lyrical or music credits on the album, so basically they are Celine Dion -- without the voice, but much cuter. Plus this seems to be a rushed album, since there are only eight tracks and then some Russian versions and remixes, plus the scandalous video.<br />Regardless of what you might think of t.A.T.u., the album does carry some gems. They are poppy but edgy, much like their run from the closet \\"Not Gonna Get Us\\" and their redundant yet striking single \\"All The Things She Said.\\"<br />The album is always exciting and new and never leaves you bored. \\"Show Me Love\\" has a wonderful melody and \\"Malchik Gay\\" is just plain catchy. The accents can be a hassle, &aacute; la Paulina Rubio.<br />\\"200 km/h in the Wrong Lane\\" touches on dim balladry with \\"30 Minutes\\" and gets an attitude with \\"How Soon is Now.\\" It then moves to a swinging tale in \\"Clowns (Can You See Me Now?).\\" But then the short set closes with \\"Stars,\\" leaving the listener wanting more.<br />It's hard to give props to t.A.T.u. because they are an image rather than artists -- then again, who isn't these days?<br />Marketing scheme aside, this album has enough spirit to keep them from having just one novelty hit.ugh spirit to keep them from having just one novelty hit.
B000000HHF|5.0|This album (yes I said album!I'm from the old school)is a definitive classic.  Anyone who says they were distracted by the skits have easily missed out on history. They were the innovators.  No one had skits before De La! Now they are almost a prerequisite for making a tight CD (alright, I give in to technology; I download 8 hours of music a day!!) They took sampling to another level.  To this day I still don't know what sample they used for Plug Tunin and I am a beat miner and sample junkie.  I saw the beginning of hip hop and I a &quot;head&quot; till I leave this Earth and De La with always have a place at the big table with this release. &quot;Me, Myself and I&quot; was the commercial hit and if its all you know off this album its time to go back to school.  That's like rooting for who's ever winning in sports; you're not a real fan.  Holla...
B00006ZCFH|3.0|Erykah Badu is a pioneer in pop culture. She single-handedly pulled an underground genre from the smoky bars right to the mainstream. Neosoul is a smooth blend of soul with an earthier, not so manufactured feel. Badu's debut album Baduizm, which embodies that kind of soul, received critical acclaim and paved the way for many talented artists such as the sultry-voiced soultress Jill Scott and acoustic queen India Arie. Badiuzm won several Grammies and drew comparison to greats such as Ella Fitzgerald and Billie Holiday. Mama's Gun, Badu's sophomore effort, showcased her lyrical prowess and embarked her on an extensive world tour from which this record developed. Worldwide Underground is called an EP (short for Extended Play), a term used to describe a record that does not have enough tracks to be an album, but is too diverse to be a single. This time around Badu lays tracks that are edgier and less radio-ready. This is demonstrated with the overwhelmingly abstract &quot;I Want You,&quot; which is ten-plus minutes long, and the live-jargon of &quot;Woo.&quot; The real treats in the EP are the nostalgic &quot;Black In The Day (Puff),&quot; a collaboration with Lenny Kravitz and a cover version that tackles issues of racism and crime by the name of &quot;The Grind.&quot; However, the highlight of Underground is &quot;Danger.&quot; This track fuses melodic fury with a catchy chorus. Other tracks fall flat, such as the lousy remix of &quot;Love Of My Life&quot; featuring Queen Latifah and Angie Stone and &quot;Think Twice.&quot; Underground is a brief thirst quencher, however, listeners not accustomed to Badu will find it hard to digest. This album is too experimental and is only recommended to avid fans of the genre.
0553573403|5.0|i have to say that i enjoyed this book.<br />extremely.<br />i don't know why i did; usually i am not the type of person to praise books all that much...<br />but for some odd reason this series gave me a reason (finally) to stay up past 12:00 reading. :)<br />maybe it's the intriguing characters, how they cross paths so intricately, how they trade insults and lies, how they deceive each other and yet remain so loyal<br />maybe it's the storyline. this plot is one of the most de-stereotypical (is that a word?) ones i have read in ages. people might protest that breaking the stereotypes of modern day fantasy is too arrogant of a gesture or such and such, but i fail to agree. i think it is very dauntless, on the other hand.<br />or perhaps it's simply the writing style. when you read it you know that this epic series is done by a master of fantasy. not one of those pretenders who copy from others.<br />basically, what i am trying to say is that if ever someone asks me who is the best author in the fantasy-fiction/sci-fi genre, one name would appear in my mind. one only.<br />i'm not saying that this man is perfect. because he's not. there's even occasional flaws and inconsistencies in the writing. but what i am saying is this. one should not de-rank (is that a word?) a novel just because it is &quot;too explicit&quot; or too graphic--one must realize this is NOT a book for children. this is not for the faint of heart, as someone once said.<br />the real world, i think, is even more cruel that what GRRM depicts in his song of ice and fire series.<br />anyone, this is highly recommended.<br />very interesting...
B00006CXXU|5.0|Call her a slut or call her superficial. For now, let's just call her stellar. Christina Aguilera has just unleashed her new album titled \\"Stripped,\\" but that is not the end of it. This album has enough songs to keep us listening for a while.<br />\\"Dirrty\\" caused a controversy all over the world with its raunchy video and a scantily-clad Aguilera humping everything in sight. Everyone seems to be ready to label her a slut or whore, but so what? She can do whatever she pleases and if she decides to throw her clothes off - just like she did for the Rolling Stone magazine cover - why can't she do it?<br />The naysayers will find the answer to every single question on the feminist anthem \\"Can't Hold Us Down\\" suitably featuring the one and only Lil' Kim, where Aguilera sings with her sharp voice celebrating sexual liberation, \\"You're just a little boy. . .you must talk so big to make up for smaller things.\\" Who is she singing to, Eminem or Fred Durst? Whoever it is, I am sure the lyrics apply to both. Then she walks away and goes into \\"Fighter,\\" a rock song about survival while under scrutiny.<br />\\"Stripped\\" is so interesting in the sense that it incorporates many different genres of music, yet is not choppy. The scrumptious Latin-beat \\"Infatuation\\" rules and then \\"Love Me 4 Me\\" comes in jamming like Jill Scott. Then, our hearts are stolen by Aguilera's dominant voice with \\"Beautiful\\" - a positive ballad.<br />Out of nowhere, Aguilera comes on hard with \\"Make Over\\" where she starts out like the Sugababes but then turns into a full-fledged pre-Hollywood angry Courtney Love. All of this shifting, however, does not harm the record as a whole.<br />Unlike her counterpart, Britney, Aguilera's record is actually soulful. This is a complete entity, rather than a collection of singles and would-bes. And also, instead of wearing her thong over her jeans, Aguilera just wears her red undies with chaps attached to them.<br />The highlights of the album are two tracks. First, the Alicia Keys penned and arranged \\"Impossible,\\" which is reminiscent of Aretha Franklin - a beautiful urban ballad. The other highlight is a carefully crafted track about sexual encounters with no strings attached titled \\"Get Mine Get Yours.\\" This song has a hook like they don't make them nowadays.<br />\\"Stripped\\" then takes a turn into the dark with the Jewel-sounding \\"I'm OK,\\" where she tackles her father's violent abuse of her mother in an almost acoustic setting. A magnificent effort.<br />This album is proof that Christina Aguilera is here to stay for a long time. At times, while listening to this record, she sounds really close to, dare I say, a young Mariah Carey.<br />If you are expecting another album that sounds like her debut, you are in for a shock. \\"Stripped\\" is a departure for the better from the debut and reveals Aguilera as an iridescent talent.cia Keys penned and arranged \\"Impossible,\\" which is reminiscent of Aretha Franklin - a beautiful urban ballad.

B000002VE7|5.0|Although a fine album, the Alan Parsons Project's 1984 release, &quot;Vulture Culture,&quot; with it's pop-oriented sound, had many Project fans worried that the veteran studio group had gotten too soft in their musical approach. So, Project leaders Alan Parsons &amp; Eric Woolfson decided that the follow-up disc, 1985's &quot;Stereotomy,&quot; would be a tougher-sounding Project album, for which many fans breathed a sigh of relief. This is a powerful, punchy, mostly hard-rocking Project album, and one of their best. The title track is an awesome, classic Project rocker, which segues quite well into the fun, upbeat &quot;Beaujolais.&quot; Next up is the terrific, ambient-rock instrumental, &quot;Urbania,&quot; and then, the Project turn the volume down a bit for one of their all-time greatest ballads, &quot;Limelight,&quot; beautifully sung by the one-and-only Gary Brooker of Procol Harum. &quot;In The Real World&quot; is a cool pop-rocker, and the pumped-up instrumental &quot;Where's The Walrus?&quot; is absolutely electric. &quot;Light Of The World&quot; is a gorgeous song, a true Project buried treasure. Finally, there's the brief, atmospheric &quot;Chinese Whispers,&quot; and the grand finale, &quot;Stereotomy Two,&quot; with the group charging for home with guns blazing. The album is outstanding from beginning to end, with first-rate songs &amp; instrumentals, incredible, energetic musicianship &amp; production, and great lead vocals by John Miles, Chris Rainbow, Gary Brooker and Graham Dye. Quite simply, &quot;Stereotomy&quot; rocks. The Alan Parsons Project's album sales may have been in decline by this point, but &quot;Stereotomy&quot; certainly remains one of the group's very best releases. Pick it up and crank it up!
B00005Q66T|4.0|All hail the queen! The one and only Madonna is back. After impressing us for an era she is back pointing her cone-bras at all the hits she delivered over a rather ailing pop decade - the '90s.<br />Eleven years after releasing her first greatest hits \\"The Immaculate Collection,\\" (Madonna, the immaculate conception - get it?) the \\"boytoy\\" girl is back with a catalogue of memorable tunes electronically titled \\"GHV2\\" - short for \\"Greatest Hits Volume Two.\\"<br />Why is Madonna such an icon, you ask? Well consider this.<br />First, without her, Britney, Christina and Jessica would be either sticking their fingers down their throats in hopes of making it in the modeling career or calling you up in the morning to tell you about a MasterCard that will save you money. However, unlike her imposters, who take pride in their untouched hymens, Madonna boldly stated, \\"Losing my virginity? I thought of it as a career move.\\"<br />Second, she is the ultimate trendsetter. Designers from Dolce & Gabbana to Stella McCartney follow her every move. How do you think the jean jacket resurfaced - from Three's Company reruns? What about the whole henna trend?<br />Third, she is the ultimate rebel. When the pope asked to meet her to chat about the \\"lewd\\" concert performance she was bringing to Italy, Madonna suggested he stand in line and buy tickets like the rest of the fans.<br />Moreover, during her Blonde Ambition tour, Madonna went on with her masturbatory antics onstage despite the threat from Canadian police to arrest her.<br />Madonna also angered many pious heads with her unashamed vocalization of her two abortions, and her video \\"Like A Prayer\\" was considered sacrilegious. She is a woman who is not afraid to exude her sexuality - whether it was with her former husband Sean Penn, a fling like Vanilla Ice or a brief stint with lesbian comic Sandra Bernard.<br />Fourth, she always reinvents herself. From disco diva to emotional balladeer, virgin to sex kitten, youngster to mother of Lola and Rocco, the first from her fitness trainer Carlos Leon and the latter from her current husband Guy Ritchie director of gangster movies like \\"Snatch\\" and Madonna's next movie \\"Love, Sex, Drugs & Money.\\" Wherever she is, she is bound to explore where she is not.<br />Fifth and finally, her pop music is delicious. Whether it is her first hit song \\"Holiday\\" or the current dance No. 1 hit \\"Impressive Instant.\\"<br />Unlike many stars, the ethereal girl developed a persona unlike any other, not afraid to break any rules as long as she broke them with style. The gay icon has even refused an offer to appear on Divas Live. Who needs to be on that show when you are it?<br />\\"GHV2\\" picks up where \\"The Immaculate Collection\\" stopped. Including such hits from the sex era, with \\"Erotica\\" and \\"Deeper And Deeper.\\"<br />When she released her pornographic book coffee table book aptly titled \\"Sex,\\" she also released her unapologetic cat-suit anthem \\"Human Nature.\\"<br />\\"GHV2\\" also includes her spiritual finger-symbol Madonna. The thumping \\"Ray Of Light,\\" the airy \\"Frozen,\\" the dark \\"Drowned World / Substitute For Love\\" and the incomparable ballad \\"The Power Of Goodbye\\" - all of which are partly the work of English mastermind William Orbit.<br />\\"Secret\\" and \\"Take A Bow\\" shine like pearls of a mellow girl. Yet, recent hits like the guitar-lead \\"Don't Tell Me,\\" and the gender-bending \\"What It Feels Like For A Girl\\" make for an upper atmosphere.<br />Furthermore, the theme song to \\"Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me,\\" \\"Beautiful Stranger\\" is thrown in as a cheerful booster.<br />\\"Bedtime Stories,\\" a collaboration with Bj&ouml;rk and Nellee Hopper, reminds us of Madonna's hallucinating time of experimentation and is a tasty treat.<br />Ironically, \\"Don't Cry For Me Argentina,\\" the theme from \\"Evita\\" is the only cover version included, whereas the sexy \\"Fever\\" and Madonna's remake of Don McLean's \\"American Pie\\" do not appear on this album. Furthermore, \\"Bad Girl\\" seems to have faded into oblivion and \\"Nothing Really Matters\\" is nowhere to be found.The album closes with the club anthem \\"Music.\\"<br />\\"GHV2\\" a record of where she has been and a sign of where she is going. The release also coincides with The Drowned World Tour Video/DVD - rumored to be her last tour. This collection is proof that she is still the queen.have faded into oblivion and \\"Nothing Really Matters\\" is nowhere to be found.The album closes with the club anthem \\"Music.\\"<br />\\"GHV2\\" a record of where she has been and a sign of where she is going.

0064407667|1.0|I am a writer and I can tell you that this series is not a good one for kids.  Kids need to be taught that through hard work and dedication, happy endings are usually to follow.  I don't understand what this series of childrens books is wanting to teach.  Books are meant to teach lessons, such as life lessons and morals.  This series of childrens books teaches that no matter how hard you try, you will always fail.
B00008PX8P|5.0|I first saw TSRTS in 1984 when I was 12 & I instantly became a fan for life. Four years later I started collecting bootlegs & I got a poor video copy of RAH 1970 & I could not believe that this concert was never released officially. Despite the terrible, and I mean terrible, sound & picture you could tell that this band was on fire. Fifteen years later & few morsels of poor copies of \\"Danish TV\\", \\"Supershow\\", \\"Tous En Scene\\", \\"Knebworth 8/11/79\\", & \\"Kashmir\\" & \\"Ten Years Gone\\" from Knebworth 8/4/79 on MTV, my prayers were finally answered; an official visual release from Zeppelin. I truly thought I'd die before that day happend.<br />The RAH show is phenomenal! Fans & former naysayer's are finally getting to see what I've known for years; that these guys were everything that rock music should & could be. There were even a few surprises from RAH I hadn't seen before, like the awesome version of \\"How Many More Times\\", a blistering \\"Bring It On Home\\", & a very lyrical version of \\"What Is...\\". The highlight for me then & now are the totally punk (yeah, you heard me, I said \\"punk\\") versions of Eddie Cochran's \\"C'mon Everybody\\" & \\"Something Else\\". This ain't your \\"Hobbit\\" Zeppelin but the true ass-kicking band that they were. It's worth the price alone.<br />The MSG 73' section is great too. I never cared for live versions of \\"Misty Mountain Hop\\" but the DVD has changed my mind. The remixing has done wonders to the bootleg copies I've heard of \\"MMH\\" through the years. I love the new \\"Since I've Been Loving You\\", the visuals are so much better then on TSRTS. \\"The Ocean\\"... the best surprise on the DVD. If you ever wondered why they never reformed after Bonham's death, here's your answer. The interplay between Bonham & Page is as tight as a vice & as loose as a goose. Even the Bonzo introduction of \\"We've done 4 already but now...\\" is priceless.<br />Earl's Court is great too. I love the acoustic set. Jones really shines on mandolin during \\"...California\\" & \\"That's The Way\\"; & \\"Bron-Yr-Aur Stomp\\" is pure fun. Surprisingly, I even really liked \\"Stairway...\\" no matter how jaded countless listens have made me(though I will always be partial to TSRTS version).<br />A real treat is the Knebworth section. I've always heard it was awful which is not the case at all. If you're a bigger fan of the 30 plus minutes versions of \\"Dazed & Confused\\" from the early days I can see where a fan might be disappointed, but if you like \\"songs\\" as opposed\\" to \\"jams\\" hopefully you won't be. A few of the songs in this section I often thought sounded weak live are absolutely fantastic! \\"Sick Again\\" totally rocks, \\"In The Evening\\" no longer has such a dominant cheesy 80's keyboard sound like on audio bootlegs, & \\"Achilles...\\" is frickin' AWESOME!!! Page is sloppy as all hell but he pours everything he has into it. Remember this is rock music metalhead guitar freaks, if you want exact precision listen to Segovia or Malmsteen. Even my older punk rock friends from the 70's now even admit how great they were after watching \\"Achilles...\\" in all it's sweaty glory. If it can change a few Sex Pistols & Iggy Pop fans minds then it truly does go across all boards. The true treat though is the revamped \\"Whole Lotta Love\\". There are 3 different riffs in this version on the same theme. The last one sounds like Black Sabbath's Toni Iommi meets The Sex Pistols Steve Jones, truly heavy,dirty, & slinky. I prefer it even to the RAH version. And they were considered \\"irrelevant\\" at this point? Plllleeeeeaaaaaasssssseeeeee.....<br />The extras are great too, particularly the Page & Plant press conference & the brief Bonham interview in Australia.<BR>All in all it was truly worth the wait & I have nothing but praise.... but I'm still hungry for more, & after viewing it you will be too... in a good way. Enjoy!
B0000640SA|4.0|The movie begins with a bang (literally and figuratively), and the viewer is immediately sucked in to the story, which, for the most part, works its way backwards in small segments, giving the viewer brief moments of continuity so that the viewer has some sense of chronology in this tale told in reverse.<br />This was my first experience with Guy Pearce in a leading role, and he was impressive, accurately portraying Leonard Shelby's sense of hopeful but frustrated determination to overcome his short-term memory loss.  Unlike Dory in Finding Nemo, however, Shelby's condition is not used for comic relief.  Instead, the story weaves its way in and out of Shelby's in-the-moment sense of reality, bringing him into contact with a variety of interesting characters, most of whom viciously manipulate him.<br />Joe Pantoliano and Carrie-Ann Moss (of Matrix fame) both play supporting roles, as does CSI/ER veteran Jorja Fox.  But the story primarily focuses on Pearce's Shelby, and his desperate attempts to find his wife's killer...and himself.<br />Although I have only watched it once, it would probably be as interesting to view again now that I know what to look for.  Not sure I would want to own it, but a very interesting story that compels you to follow it to completion.
B0000DD7LC|5.0|This is a wonderful sophomore CD from Alicia Keys. I'm glad to see artists with unique talent do well. This CD is not boring. Alicia is showcasing her real talent. The Diary of Alicia Keys is superior to its predecessor, and I can say that with confidence. We finally get to hear what Alicia is all about.<br />This CD had a lot of different flavors: pure soul, classical, jazz, hip-hip. It's a great mixture that is well blended. It's refreshing to walk away from a CD being moved, inspired, and in awe.<br />I'm 30 years old, and I absolutely LOVE this CD!!!
B0000DD7LB|4.0|Being a sort of fan of Britney but never buying a full album from her because they were really unbalanced and bad. Being really aware that she is this marketing machine. Being aware that she is Britney Spears... I still love it. It's perhaps over produced and her vocals are almost non-excistant but it's a good party CD. It's good for a workout, it's good when you wanna feel really good about yourself. It gives me a lil kick. It would need a tad of editing and removing of such songs as &quot;the hook up&quot; and &quot;showdown&quot; (those should have been B sides of singles, if even that). Othervise I am happy with it.. Now if she could behave in her private life and consentrate on the music that she is against...
6302150930|5.0|I have seen this movie when it came out. I have seen it several times since then. I hadn't watched it for many years now because I knew that it could happen to anyone even more so today. I went into a trend of watching only &quot;upbeat&quot; movies. I now, with age, realized that this is an UPBEAT movie if you watch it with wisdom and not with snob. If you are arrogant enough to think that Polanski just shoots films that reminds him of Tate and Manson then you don't know enough about Polanski or just don't want to accept that &quot;things&quot; can get so wrong that you don't prepare for it with humor, passion, and love for yourself and others. In every homeless person's life there is a Tess story. If you wish to think in religious terms this is the Story of Job. Anybody is just an illness, a disaster away from Tess: Once it happens you will see how dignity is the only way out BUT you must get on your feet again BEFORE society chastises you as a bum.
B000099T2L|2.0|She is better off alone for sure but what happened?<br />There are the hits: \\"crazy in love\\" and \\"work it out\\" and of course \\"baby boy\\" (which never struck a nerve with me until the overly sexed up video), but this album is just desperate and forced. Songs like \\"Signs (Feat. Missy Elliott)\\" numerous other tracks on this album begin with interesting ideas and sounds but lack to keep the interest after 30 seconds. Lyrics are naive and silly and don't add up to the other incridients on the album.
B00005JMTN|4.0|The tension between Reality and Fantasy, Truth and Lies has always held a particular fascination for Tim Burton: \\"Edward Scissorhands,\\" \\"Batman\\" for example and now, \\"Big Fish.\\"<br />In \\"Big Fish\\" though, Burton is after something more common to all of us, more human than a man with wings or a boy with scissors instead of hands, he's after the most enduring and difficult of all relationships a man will have in his life...his relationship with his father.<br />Ed Bloom (Ewan McGregor as the young, Albert Finney as the old) is a dreamer, a storyteller and at times a buffoon who has managed his relationship with his son, Will (Billy Crudup) by telling fascinating and wondrous tales instead of being honest and straightforward. Is Ed avoiding the truth or merely embellishing it? And by doing so is he attempting to teach Will something more real and enduring than the factual retelling of the truth?<br />The acting here is first rate, though McGregor seems to be building a career based on the same gee-whiz note of late. What happened to the alternative McGregor of  \\"Velvet Goldmine\\" and \\"Trainspotting?\\" Jessica Lange, in her role as Ed's wife and Will's mother, is glorious: she is the repository of all that is good, truthful and faithful...she is our dream mother and wife.<br />\\"Big Fish\\" loses steam in the middle section and could be cut by about 10 minutes but the final scenes bring everything back in focus and the last scene between Ed and Will is a doozy: cathartic and emotionally available.
B0000DJZA5|3.0|Listening the the CD I must agree I was a bit dissapointed, too. Instead of Let It Be... Naked the proper title would have been Get Back...Naked because Get Back was the original title of the project. The cover is terrible. Instead of being a positive album it looks so negative. They should have released the entire studio versions in one CD and the full rooftop concert in the second CD (I was certainly expecting something like that, but...). I must admit the sound of the songs are really fantastic (For You Blue, Two Of Us, Across The Universe for example) but was a bit dissapointed with some of the songs (the finale of Get Back is missing, Don't Let Me Down is an inferior version, the mix at the end of I've Got A Feeling doesn't sound well). Let's hope that some day they will release the album as it was originally intended to be in January 1969.
B00008BXJF|4.0|This is the first I've explored of KING CRIMSON, and I'm decently impressed.  Great musicianship is what THE POWER TO BELIEVE is all about.  A sweeping disc filled with rich instrumentation and melodious vocals that is a great late night headphone trip.  A good addition to any hard alternative rock collection for those who like thier music deep and complex.
B0000DJZA5|1.0|>As for \\"The Long and Winding Road\\"--c'mon, folks, it's a piece of schmaltz to begin with, and so is \\"Let It Be\\" (with an extra dose of Mariolatry). It's top-quality schmaltz, I should say, written by a real pro. But when you lean too hard on stuff like this--which is what Phil Spector did when he added the choirs and strings--it turns into something worse: kitsch. <br />Well, I think this is a reasonable assessment. The Phil Spector version of Road is certainly imperfect. On the other hand, if phrases like \\"the wild and windy night\\" are not quite kitsch, they are awfully close. So Phil Spector had his work cut out for him; you're asking him to be true to the hyper-schmaltziness, maybe not-quite-kitschiness, of the song without ever crossing over into more-or-less real kitsch: a tall order. I'll tell you what, though: Sometimes I LIKE kitsch. Sometimes, for me, something very like Phil Spector's version of Road just hits the spot. In any case:<br />>So I prefer the stripped-down versions.<br />This is where we part company. The real (as far as I can tell) stripped-down version we find on \\"Anthology\\" is innocuous, but it's got gaping holes. It really, really needs SOMETHING. On the other hand, the version we find on Naked (I have trouble calling this one \\"stripped-down\\" because it seems so obviously doctored), is just...how can I put this dispassionately? I can't....It's just hideous. That instrumental solo (I can't even tell what instrument it's supposed to be)! That electric guitar! HELP!
B00005JLRT|3.0|I am NOT a Trekkie.  Being merely a fan of TNG, I found this entry in the series dissapointing especially if this be the last TNG film.  STAR TREK-NEMESIS has the plotting of an average episode.  Aside from one great effect (DATA's jump through space), the story was not engaging enough to be the journey's end.  It would've been nice to see something as clever and creative as the ALL GOOD THINGS episode to cap off the best entry in the STAR TREK universe (yes, the best-better than the original series).  Go back and watch INSURECTION again, it's really a great flick and would have been a great segway into the final chapter of TNG if only that final chapter was as compeling as the better moments in a great series of shows and movies.  Too bad, would've been nice to see a couple more adventures from PICARD's crew, guess we're all stuck with the average STAR TREK-NEMESIS.
B000002UAR|3.0|Despite the herd mentality and polls that hold out this album as a watershed, it falls into the middle of the pack.  There are many better Beatle albums as well as better albums by other artists.  There are some good songs, notably Taxman, and some songs that take away from the album's appeal such as Yellow Submarine.<br />3 stars, as in average.
0452282152|5.0|Johannes Vermeer is one of the most appraised and complete painters of all time. His ending in poverty and short life add to that aura of mistery and curiosity that envolves names like Michelangelo, Mozart and such. The name of the book is also the name of one of the most famous paintings by the XVIIth century, wich is considered the \\"Dutch Monalisa\\". If you have never seen this painting, just look at the cover of the book. Who is that girl? Like DaVinci's Monalisa, no one knows who was the model to Vermeer's almost mystic portrait. That's what author Tracy Chevalier imagines in her story.<br />\\"Girl with a pearl earring\\" is the tale, told in first person, of Griet, the suddenly impoverished girl who spent more than two years as a maid in the Vermeer's household. Griet's arrival is seen with suspicions from the beginning, because she's a protestant, not a catholic like the Vermeers. Four daughters, the wife, the mother-in-law, and an older maid, everybody dislikes the new girl, with the exception of Johannes himseld, a quiet, withdrawn yet intense man; but, with her simple and straightforward way, Griet, little by little, becomes one of the most important people in the house. Read the book and you'll know why.<br />Chevalier's book is, in fact, almost like a Vermeer painting: behind the apparent simplicity lies technic, perception and study. I've seen a few people complain that this book has no plot, no climax, it's dull, etc. Well, my advice is to this people is: stick to your shallow thrillers and gun-fight books. \\"Girl with a pearl earring\\" is a book made for people able to appreciate it. Just like a painting, but moving through your mind.<br />Grade 9.0/10

0743455967|5.0|Up front, I have to admit that I'm neither a dyed in the wool Stephen King fan nor am I an aspiring young writer.  For these reasons, I'm not even sure why I read his _ON WRITING_.  However, I did read it, and I'm glad that I did.<br />The section devoted to his youthful experiences hit close to home for me.  Since I feel as if I shared a lot of his childhood angst,  I found this mini-bio appealing.   <br />I believe that _ON WRITING_ can't quite be looked at as two separate books in the way that many reviewers, both editorial and contributing, feel that it is.  It seems to me that the craftsmanship portion of the book is a logical follow on to the life experiences covered in the first section.  I also feel that the third section of the book, which discusses his almost fatal accident and his period of convalescence, is an integral part of the whole narrative.  By this, I mean that coping with his painful recovery helped him over his \\"writer's block\\" and that forcing himself to write again aided his recovery.  <br />_ON WRITING_ also contains a lot of information that you just don't find in most books about the nuts and bolts of writing.  An example of this is his \\"composite\\" unpublished writer who recognizes the need of an agent and goes about preparing to find one the right way, i.e. first by writing, submitting, and getting, as would be expected, a lot of rejection slips -- then by not getting discouraged by these rejections and continuing to write and submit his stories -- by recognizing the importance to a beginner of the \\"little magazines\\" -- by continuing to submit, taking note of the comments on some rejection slips, and eventually getting a few acceptances  -- then by parlaying these acceptances into items on a resume and using this resume to obtain a good agent.  The details of how this might be done make the book valuable, even if you were to get nothing else out of it.  <br />You will, however, get other things out of it.  For instance, you'll find that adverb is a \\"dirty word,\\" and that adverbs should almost always be avoided.  King also reminds us that sentence structure, paragraphing, good grammar and proper punctuation are valuable tools, as are neatness, professionalism of approach, and, something he learned from an early rejection, staples are no-no's.  Oh, yes, there's also the \\"10% rule\\" that you'll find interesting and valuable<br />I could go on, but King is one heck of a lot better at expressing these and other ideas than I'll ever be, so I really would advise the early-career writer to read _ON WRITING_ by Stephen King.<br />Since I'm not one of the writing hopefuls for whom the book was written, I won't worry too much if this review violates a half dozen or so of the guidelines for good writing, although I have attempted to do a competent writing job.  (Also see his discussion of \\"Hacks\\" vs. \\"Competent Writers\\" vs. \\"Good Writers.\\"  It's another concept that I have not seen elsewhere.
B000084T18|3.0|I'm not at all surprised that this album has been such a huge hit - the beats and songs are way above average and, most rare for a rap album, it's solid all the way through. However, 50 is a garbage lyricist. His stuff rhymes, and his lines about street violence and wealth are notable for their veracity, but that's really about it. There are no quotable bursts of wordplay on the entire CD. 50 should take some of his millions and slide some Llyod Banks's way in exchange for his rhyme book.
B00005JKC3|1.0|I knew this would be bad.  I saw a preview for it and was so amazed that they were making a hulk movie because i loved the Bill Bixby and Lou Ferrigno one, but then, i looked at screenshots online and saw that the hulk was poorly computerized and cheesy.  Then, after seeing Spider Man, I knew that this would be another Marvel masterpiece down in the dumps.  I hated every aspect of both movies.  The only Marvel-based movies that i can say I enjoyed was X-men, X2, and all the old movies (Batman, Superman...).  Whoever made those movies can teach the people who made this crap a few things.
B0000AXE8I|3.0|Highlights: special-effects; style<BR>Lowpoints: plot; acting<BR> <BR>Conclusion: It's as simple as it gets - I found the original Matrix way too overrated (Tarkovsky exploited those themes visually long before the Wachowskis), but also way above average in terms of Hollywood fare. The second part is just the same for me - good special effects (just fun to watch, rather fake-looking actually, except the 40-minute race and Neo flying), good style, bad plot (been there, done that) and wooden acting. Fishburne runs through the religious routine as Morpheus, Carrie-Ann Moss is blank and a tool for wires as Trinity, and Neo is wandering from one plot point to the other like a puppet. <BR> Hell, this is all right though, maybe too pretentious and long, but definitely worth $10. Just to see the rest of the world catch on and be disappointed. <BR> The Matrix really isn't that special, people. Watch Wachowski's earlier 'Bound' instead, now THAT'S original.
0385504209|5.0|As previously mentioned, &quot;The Da Vinci Code&quot; is not your typical &quot;Who done it?&quot; novel. Well researched and expertly written, the book presents an age-old religious secret under the guise of a tantalizing mystery. Definitely not an easy book to put down, the twists and turns wind you toward the solution, which is not as easy to figure out as some reviewers will have you believe. Of course, that is a relative statement. ;)<br />I highly recommend this work to anyone wishing to take an exciting journey through the pages of a book, which will exercise also their mind.<br />I might also recommend &quot;Angels &amp; Demons,&quot; the first of Mr. Brown's books to feature Robert Langdon.<br />&quot;Tight Lines!&quot;<br />~..~..~.. &gt;&lt;((((*&gt;

0385504209|5.0|Couldn't put this book down - the author uses little known historical theories to create a compelling story that excites from beginning to end.  He successfully crafts a riveting thriller, and makes the reader consider history, art, and religion in new ways.  But this book is not to be taken as fact; it is a novel, and those who critize it for being too outlandish or historically inaccurate are missing the point.  This is brilliant work, and definitely worth reading.

B000001ESF|5.0|Anyone who knows RUSH history knows how critical this album was for the trio. Back in 1975 following disapointing sales of &quot;Cares of Steel&quot;, their worst comercial venture yet, 2112 was a make or break venture for the band. Many people close to the band knew that if sales didn't improve, the strategy was to release one last live album, &amp; call it quits. Their solution was to present a rock opus that was just as much aggressive as it was intriguing. The result - Let's just say this was &quot;the break out album&quot; for RUSH. RUSH not only proved they were a force to reckoned with in Europe, Canada, &amp; the USA, but as record sales soared for the first time in their career, it gave the band a new sense of hope for the future. 2112 is without a doubt the best &quot;first phase&quot; RUSH album. If someone approcahed my as asked what are the top 3 RUSH albums - I would respond - 2112(1st Phase), Moving Pictures(2nd Phase) Grace Under Pressure (Final Phase).<BR>2112 is a must!!!!!!!!!! even if you are not a dedicated fan.<br />Cyrus Rhodes<BR>rhodesm@charter.net

B00006RINF|5.0|The combination of Cristina Scabbia's harmonic vocals along with the amazing skills on guitar's and drums make Comalies to be one of the best cd's of the year.  Every single song on the cd is original in it's words and in the melody.  The cover design is simple but cool, the songs on the cd are anything but simple though, they are complex in their meanings.  I am wondering how many other kick ass bands Italy has hidden away waiting to be released into the rock world.  If they are anything like Lacuna Coil, then I cannot wait.
B000092ZYX|4.0|A lot has been made of this album being a return to Radiohead's guitar roots. Personally, I enjoyed the detours they took with Kid A and Amnesiac. The restlessness of the band during that period produced some of their best work. In particular, the beauty of Kid A was in finding those moments when vulnerability and humanity would poke through the electronic (some would say distant) veneer of the music. Such moments came when Thom Yorke screamed \\"what was that you tried to say\\" on \\"Everything In Its Right Place\\"; during his refrains of \\"ahhhhs\\" toward the end of \\"How To Disappear Completely\\"; and his wail of \\"cut the kids in half\\" on \\"Morning Bell\\". For me, these and other moments (such as Amnesiac's sublime \\"Pyramid Song\\", with its uplifting refrain of \\"there was nothing to fear, nothing to doubt\\") dispel the notion of Radiohead's music as cold or depressing.<br />That said, it is an absolute joy to listen to Hail to the Thief and hear Thom Yorke let the soul back into his voice. After one listen, I'm even tempted to refer to this as Radiohead's soul and funk album (but I won't). Simply put, the return of guitars, human drumming and Yorke's soulful crooning do all hark back to Bends-era Radiohead, but (thankfully) they have not completely abandoned the electronic affects of their two most recent albums. <br />The album opens with the cutting \\"2 + 2 = 5\\". A song about the perils of apathy, it resonates powerfully for those trying to endure life under Emperor Bush. That track leads into the sparse, bluesy, haunting \\"Sit down, Stand up\\". It's on this song that Yorke's vocals take the first of many soulful turns on Hail (most notably in the refrain \\"we can wipe you out any time\\"). These two songs make up what is perhaps the most harrowing opening sequence of any Radiohead album. So, in typical Radiohead fashion, they include the lullaby of \\"Sail to the Moon\\" to temper the doomy intro. Harking back to \\"Street Spirit\\" and \\"Pyramid Song\\", \\"Sail\\" is one of this album's brightest, most familiar moments.<br />Colin Greenwood's bass makes a triumphant return on the seething, funky \\"Backdrifts\\". When I first heard the album, I wanted this song to go on forever. It's one of the sleekest, most effective songs they've ever done, and definitely a highlight of this album. Acoustic guitar heralds the beginning of \\"Go to Sleep\\" via a riff that would do R.E.M. proud. Here we find Radiohead in the fine three-guitar form so many of us fell in love with on The Bends. Elsewhere, an edgy riff and TY's jagged vocal delivery haunt \\"Where I End &amp; You Begin\\"; and \\"We Suck Young Blood\\" might be the best song ever written about Hollywood's penchant for chewing up and spitting out \\"the next big thing\\".<br />On its face, \\"I will\\" is a very sad song, but I take comfort in TY's warm vocal and in the image of a father protecting his children (even if he is hunkering down with them in a bunker to avoid the apocalypse). &quot;The Gloaming&quot; is perhaps the album's gloomiest track, yet it's not defeatist in that it's narrator is defiantly hopeful. And leadoff single &quot;There There&quot;, with its tribal drumming and catchy refrains of &quot;why so green and lonely/heaven sent you to me&quot; and &quot;we are accidents waiting to happen&quot; offers perhaps the best introduction to the album as it combines the best aspects of their previous work in a forward-looking way.<br />What appears on Hail to the Thief, then is a compromise-a middle ground, if you will-of two prominent extremes of the band's sound (guitar-led rock and electronic experimentation). The slow tone poems of Kid A are gone. In their place, are more traditional songs, some of which even contain humor (\\"A Punchup at a Wedding\\", \\"Myxomatosis\\" and \\"A Wolf at the Door\\"). Most importantly, they sound confident and comfortable in their own skin; less like they have something to prove.
B00005JMCN|5.0|This was definitely one of the better movies of the summer.  In a season full of big-budget duds, Seabiscuit was able to live up to its own theme and become the dark horse high-grossing film among those all-too-often dumbed down three months of cinema.    I think most know the story.  But for those who don't, it is about a \\"horse that's too small, a jockey that's too big and and trainer that's too old,\\" as Jeff Bridges stated within the film.  It is not only about the horse himself and how it prevails, winning race after race.  It also concerns the three men (played by Jeff Bridges, Chris Cooper and Tobey McGuire) whose lives are changed by the tiny little animal that seems relentless in its victory.    This story may sound very inspiring, and that it is.  But what I found depressing is that the original story of Seabiscuit contained many more hardships and tough times than Gary Ross' period piece actually portrayed.  It is as if DreamWorks was afraid that the dark subject matter would hinder sales.  I tell you one thing, when movie companies think too much about the audience (whose standards aren't that high considering most think of cinema as a means of entertainment rather than art) it angers me, because loss of artistic integrity become inevitable.    Luckily, most of the film was well-performed, namely by Jeff Bridges, who remains one of our nation's best actors.  It was unfortunate that the wonderful Chris Cooper was given an interesting role without much to do or express.  I wish more depth had been written into his characacter.    Although this is my second review of this particular film and I said it did improve with additional viewing (I stand by that statement), I gave it three stars rather than my previous four because there was nothing ground-breaking about Seabiscuit.  I began to realize how common it was thanks to the lack of realistic portrayals of the three men's lives, particularly Red's (Tobey McGuire).  I don't expect many to take the film as seriously as I do, so I reassure you that Seabiscuit is a film most will enjoy and be moved by to full extent.

0679720200|5.0|.<BR>In the story of the Stranger, one finds the lead character, Meursault lacking creativity and of passions within oneself, of the depth of conflict that burns in one's center that moves with chaos and value-positing; none of this can be found in Meursault. He is matter of fact in everything. True, his acceptance and passionless being allows him to under go his ordeal in subdued emotion and unenthusiastic plight, yet this groundlessness and existential being does not excite in living, but simply goes along in existing. <br />Even in Meursault's act of killing, there lacks any real passionate fervor. His pulling of the trigger was just that; an easy act of the finger and no real understanding, that is, no depth in comprehension of the act itself, but merely a nonchalant action that seems to have been the best alternative of action at the time of occurrence. And yet, the lack of alternative actions is the problem. <br />In each and every situation in Meursault's life, from the death of his mother to his sexual relationship to his befriending his neighbors, all is performed as a cog in a machine. As each piano key is hit, only to be in succession of what is already programmed on the sheet roll of music. The \\"last man\\" mentality of the Lockean view of self-preservation dominates Meursault's life as the bourgeois in existential nothingness and mediocre existence. <br />Should Meursault suffer as he did for his actions? Were they really so evil? Were his actions simply the result of being in the wrong place at the wrong time, or in this case, befriending the wrong person who caused these thugs to appear for Meursault to confront? If life can be reduced to existence over conflict then certainly Meursault could be pardoned.  But the one must ask if Meursault's action, the act of murder, not of self defense, can ever be excused, simply for the fact that the man who committed such did so from a lack of inner conflict and passion, from an act that simply called to be for themoment it presided in.<br />The answer to Camus' Meursault comes from our view of subjectivity or objectivity. The Stranger places us in the former as we are personally involved as we read the story from the inside view and thus we side with Meursault. Yet when we are able to detach ourselves and look objectively, we gain a higher perspective and thus a different viewpoint.<br />Robert Shattuck, from his book Forbidden Knowledge, remarks on The Stranger with the following point, that knowledge can be double bound; subjective or objective;:<br />\\"The closer one approaches to an event or to a person, the less securely one seems to know it. The trees obscure the forest. The more one knows, the less one knows. Perception itself requires a certain distance. Empathy hides more than it reveals.\\" p. 162 <br />Our closeness brings empathy, which distorts our power of observation and obscures the facts. That appears to be the case in Camus' The Stranger.

B0000CEB4V|5.0|Wow, I don't think anyone could ask for more in a concert video than this. I had never heard of this DVD before I just ran into it by accident, and the only negative thing I can say is that more effort whould have gone into its marketing. Disc 1 is the full-length concert film which includes a very long section of Indian music. I suppose this won't be every Westerner's cup of tea, but I would encourage all viewers to at least give it a chance. I myself was totally transfixed by the Indian music, performed on sitar by Ravi Shankar's daughter, who also directs a large Indian orchestra in a lengthy symphonic-style piece.<br />The second part of the concert consists of tribute performances of George Harrison's music by rock artists, including Eric Clapton. There is really not a bad song in the bunch, and both the video and surround audio are great.

B00012QM8G|4.0|This film is worthy of great praise for many reasons, though I have called it \\"almost great\\", and I stand by that.  The film is vastly important - in spite of Steven Spielberg's nerve finally giving out in the last few minutes as he went for a dash of melodrama (Liam Neeson's Oskar Schindler weeping about his not sacrificing his car or his Nazi pin to save \\"just one more\\").  It's a long reverberating gong at the end of an otherwise stirring piece of symphonic music.  What came before was so emotionally wrenching that it rendered the scene absolutely pointless. Though I'm certain this was not the intent, it actually seemed to me self-pitying.  Schindler, by that time, should have been way beyond such a state.  There was nothing left to do, dramatically speaking, but drive off in silence.<br />Until that scene (a couple of small bits aside), Spielberg had resisted the temptation to \\"dramatize\\" and simply reported his story in an almost journalistic way, without flinching or stylizing it beyond the canny choice of shooting in black and white.  The burst of actorish speechifying served to jolt us out of the immersive sense of hyper-realism and remind us that it was, after all, a movie.<br />But, in the larger context, that is a minor point.  What the film did successfully - and what nearly makes it a masterpiece - is vividly bring to life the most shameful event of the 20th century: the cold, systematic murder of six million people because of their ethnic and religious origin.  It's an obscenity that such a thing ever happened, and the film makes that so clear that - for literally days after I saw it - I could not get that number out of my head: six million.  The immensity of the Holocaust is almost unbearable, and if history books don't spell that out well enough, then films that tackle the subject need to.  Schindler's List does so - with great passion and skill.<br />Some people have described the film as \\"uplifting\\".  That it tries to be is its other flaw.  Make no mistake: what the real Oskar Schindler did was an act of unalloyed heroism.  He deserves to be celebrated for that.  But no one should leave this film feeling good, because his heroism should never have been necessary.<br />Kurt Vonnegut wrote a great novel, in part autobiographical, that  centered on the firebombing of Dresden.  While no one could sanely accuse him of sympathizing with the Nazis, his book \\"Slaughterhouse-Five\\" succeeds in telling us something that we should never forget: while the fires that consumed Dresden may have contributed to ending the war and saving many lives, and while it may have even been necessary to incenerate tens of thousands of women and children in the process, the act itself is no less horrifying and barbaric.  By the same token, the many acts of bravery and compassion on the part of military and civilian personnel alike (Schindler was not alone in saving lives), do nothing to mitigate the fact that World War II should never have happened in the first place.  By treating war - ANY war - as an opportunity to celebrate our redemptive qualities, we run the risk of romanticising our destructive, evil qualities as well.  To put it brutally, what Oskar Schindler did is what any human being should have done, anyway, given the circumstances.<br />That more people did not is what we should really take from this film.no mistake: what the real Oskar Schindler did was an act of unalloyed heroism.

0792844793|2.0|To make a long story short-this movie is not a masterpiece, calling it that would be laughable.This is a mediocre film at best.There is nothing shocking or controversial or boundary breaking about it, as has been said.Truth to be told the film starts out intriguingly and you're actually thinking this is going to be a great movie, it is a little strange, but nevertheless convincing and even fascinating.This keeps up for about ten minutes, and then the film becomes a typical mystery with nothing new to offer.IN fact,only thanks to Dennis Hopper's convincing role as drug-addicted maniac Frank Booth, did I keep watching this.None of the other performances were convincing,and Isabella Rossellini was just pathetically laughable,her portrayl was completely overblown, and overacted.I know I'm going to get about 30 negative votes for this, but I could care less.One of the most unjustly overrated films of all time.Not to mention the ending was like something out of a Lifetime movie,yes that predictable and unnafecting.And I guess,if you're really bored one Saturday night you could rent this movie for mild distraction.That's all I got from it.See Mulholland DR. instead
B000062XM3|5.0|Edward Norton's character \\"Jack\\" lives a lackluster, dreary 9 to 5 job in a cubicle typical of corporate America today.  Jack can't sleep, ends up going to group help meetings, faking any type of condition to get a release, in the form of a good cry.  He meets another fraud in Marla Singer (Helena Bonham Carter) and it ruins it for him.  They agree to split the meetings so they don't have to see each other.  Then, on the way back on a business flight, he meets Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt).  Jack gets Tyler's business card and when Jack finds his apartment has been blown to pieces, he calls Tyler.  They end up meeting for drinks and then at Tyler's request having a fight.  They bond and Jack is invited to live with Tyler.<BR> Tyler lives in an abandoned house, a real dump.  Things start happening that affect Jack profoundly.  The fighting eventually builds into a cult following and becomes Fight Club.  The common line is \\"we are a generation of men raised by women.\\"  Profound statements by Tyler seem to flow like a river. Jack has a meeting with the boss due to Jacks failing performance at work and the resulting scene is one of my favorites.  The Club turns into a rowdy group, causing chaos across the city. Fight Club grows and eventually moves to other cities.  <BR> Tyler ends up with Marla after a plead for help during a suicide attempt, Jack hates her.  Tyler starts \\"Project Mayhem\\" without Jack's knowledge and the extremes that this action is leading to are more than Jack wants to deal with.  The ending is a big twist and begs one to see the movie again to see where the twist should have been a known during the movie.<BR>        The fascinating cinematography, the rapid pace, the plot development and the unbelievable acting just cannot be fully appreciated in one viewing, making this one of my most watched DVDs.  Edward Norton's narration is perfect and I watch the movie to listen to his narration as much as anything else.  Brad Pitt has the ability to portray the Alpha male to a tee and his personal style exemplifies Tyler Durden.
B00005JKJA|5.0|I wish I could whole-heartedely reccomend this film to everyone,but the truth is,if you like standard films which lay out all the facts on the table,then this film is just not for you.You don't have to be some major intellectual to take this film in either(I'm 14), you just need patience and an open mind.If you have those things in check,and don't mind movies that are both challenging and wacky, see this.First of all, I'll just say that Mulholland Dr. is absolutely beautiful,beautifully filmed,presented,has some beautiful musical moments and for those sensory images alone is worth a viewing. I don't want to give away a whole lot, because I'd like for you to see for yourself.Mulholland drive is honestly one of the best films I've ever seen.Because while I don't get what the director is trying to portray through each and every single detail, I get what he is trying to show.He,thorough a series of loose ends(scenes)portrays two worlds.One is filled with hope and beauty and light, while the other is dark,and cold,and contemptuous.And that is why I love this movie so much, because it plays out exactly like what it is trying to portray-on the surface Mulholland Drive seems like a highly,stylistic glossy product, but underneath the gloss, there lies warmth,emotion,and drowned hope.Stunning, and the ending was just perfect.
B0000584V3|5.0|OK, repeat after me:<BR>I will listen to Opeth.<BR>I will listen all the way to the end of the song.<BR>I will not skip tracks.<BR>I will listen to the whole thing.<br />That's what it takes to truly understand the near-flawless majesty of Opeth's music. With most of the songs clocking in at over 10 minutes, there's no question that this album is not for the faint of heart.  It can take a couple listens until you &quot;get it&quot;, but when you do, I promise Blackwater Park will change your entire perspective on metal.  The album is crushingly heavy, breathtakingly beautiful, and hauntingly dark the whole way through; songs like &quot;Bleak&quot; and &quot;Blackwater Park&quot; seamlessly drift from snarling, molten-metal assaults to airy, sometimes jazzy acoustic passages. The guitars and bass are head-shakingly virtuosic and perfectly intertwined, the drumming is flawless, and yes, Mikael Akerfeldt can sing pretty damn well when he wants to! Blackwater Park is a masterpiece.
B0000CFW87|5.0|I like the songs on this CD even more than I did his first album.  And I especially like the DVD that's included - it lets you see how his album was made and gives you a little more insight to the music and the guy himself.  I love his voice!  I'll happily sit in traffic as long as I have this CD in my car!
B000002KIE|5.0|Let me be quite clear - I don't listen to that much punk. I listen to Ramones, Dead Kennedys, Minor Threat, this one CD by these guys, Black Flag, and the Clash. Basically your essentials. So, within my limited experience of punk music in general, I'd say this is very good, very great. Sure, there are clunkers like &quot;No Feelings&quot; and &quot;Sub-Mission&quot; (ouuuch). But you can't deny &quot;God Save The Queen&quot; because of punk ethics or whatever - it's just a really great song. Same with &quot;Holidays In The Sun&quot; and &quot;EMI&quot; (surely one of the great record label rants ever). So, even though they were manufactured, it is a great CD. I know this is gonna sound really weird, but I just love the basslines and the bass sound on this CD.

B000001IQH|5.0|I have to admit that I am mostly a fan of first generation Brit Punk and other late 70's bands.  My favorite of all time being the Clash.  I had heard my friends say good things about the album but I was wary about picking it up because I didn't want to be dissapointed.  By dissaointed, I mean I didn't want to hear anything that sounded like Blink 182, Good Charlotte, or some other crappy, &quot;punk&quot; band.  I have to say I made a great choice buying this album.  It rings with the vitality and energy that made punk music so great in the first place.  Combine that with distinctive vocals, biting guitars and smart lyrics and you have a winner.  This album is proof that punk still lives.  In fact, I liked this album so much i've already gone and bought Go For It, which may even be better.  Any fans of punk music should definitely purchase this album, you will not be dissapointed, you may actually find a new favorite.
B0000AZJXQ|4.0|This is not one of those cds that you really inhale the first time you listen to it. So after listening to it one time i stashed it away and didn't try it again till about a month later. Just thinking of all the time I spent not listening to this is depressing. heh heh. It's actually a very good cd. With songs like &quot;noose&quot; that attack these stupid buttholes that call themselves born again and suddenly they're releaved of any evil that they have done. Just all around great smart, rocking music. Still keep in mind though that even with Maynard singing that this is very diffrent music from Tool. So if thats all your after this may not be your album.
B00005JM02|5.0|Since there are countless reviews about this film, I won't say how great it is, but provide my review solely for the DVD.<br />The DVD is loaded with special features, including the wide screen and full screen versions, so you don't have to worry about which disc to buy.  It also includes an \\"Aquarium Vision\\" feature that is just a virtual aquarium for those lacking a real one.  I found it really relaxing to sleep to.  The making of featurette and commentary is one of the best I have seen for any movie. You don't realize how difficult it is to do something seemingly simple, like animate water or create shadows underwater until you listen to the director.  The DVD also includes a look at the culture of Pixar Studios and the hundreds of people that worked on the film, which I found pretty interesting. Disc one is really more geared to adults than children.<br />The sound quality and picture is amazing.  Whenever a film is transferred from widescreen to full screen format, it is accomplished by cutting off the sides of the picture so that it fills up the entire screen.  Pixar actually added new animation to the film for the full screen format, so not only do you not have to worry about the picture being cut, but you are actually getting new footage.<br />if you purchase the DVD, not only are you getting a great movie, but the bonus features will keep you entertained for hours after Nemo and Marlin have swum away.
B00006F7S4|4.0|I won't go over how serene, or what a bummer this album is as there's about 200 or so reviewers that will say the same. What I will say is that Nigel Goodrich and Beck teamed up to create another great album. It's really a mellow album with the synths and strings adding a nice technicolor touch. If you liked Mutations then this is the album for you. If you didn't like Mutations and are more of an Odelay fan I'd say give this one a chance as it's got a nice serene feel to it that may really appeal to you.
B0000DD7LB|3.0|Depends on which Britney you like--the bubble gum Britney of Hit Me Baby One More Time, or the Ghetto Hoochie of the current Britney. All the songs are done quite well, with the exception of her collaboration with Madonna. That song sounds like a broken Casio beat box.
B00006M183|5.0|This osn't my favorite Pearl Jam cd, behind Yield and Binaural. Matbe even Vitalogy. So right there you can see if you are a fan of Ten and Vs. or like the &quot;harder stuff&quot; then I don't know how much use I am of yours. I am a big fan of &quot;grunge&quot; though, Soundgarden, AIC, Screaming Trees, STP etc. One reason I believe Ten isn't as good as it was in my mind is the radio and whatnot. Practically every song on there got played over and over. I can't listen to 'Even Flow' anymore. But this cd has it's highs and some stuff that isn't all that great. My favorites on the cd are- 'Can't Keep', 'Save You', 'LBC','I am Mine', and 'Thumbing My Way.' those aren't the only ones but probably my top 5. I read some of these reviews and a lot were saying how bad it is, and how bad Binaural is. So i just decided to write a review, and it isn't really like Ten or Vs. at all. So if you are real big on those albums you might like this album you might not. I'm sure you've probably heard 'I am Mine' and 'Cropduster' maybe a few others, and if you like those then you'll probably like the cd. Not to say it is repetitive or anything, cause the songs don't sound the same, but they're kind of similar in a few ways i suppose. I don't give this a 5 star, more of a 4.5 or so, but i rounded it up.
0142000663|4.0|The Grapes of Wrath was written by John Steinbeck.  It basically describes the tragedy of the Oklahoma sandstorms.  The first section of the book is nothing more than a very detailed chapter, describing the sandstorms and the lives of the people living in Oklahoma at this period of time.  Steinbeck does a great job at describing the miserable life of these people.  I thought this was an essential part of the book because it set the mood of the book.  It showed the reader, right away, what was going on in the world, and how horrible it was, before he gets into the characters of the story.<br /> During this horrible time, a family decides to leave Oklahoma like every other family was.  They decide to travel to California in search for some fortune from the Gold Rush.  Their trip is very long and harsh.  They all travel across the country with a carriage and a couple of horses.  They experience a lot of hardships on their journey.  Close to the end of their trip a family member dies because of a disease in their foot.  When the family finally gets to California they are expecting an easy life and they are expecting happiness but all they find is more poverty, like in Oklahoma.  Nothing was different.<br /> This is the part of the book when I finally realized the family's pain.  I finally started to feel really bad for them.  This is a huge reason why I loved this book.  Towards the end of the book I had serious feelings for the characters.  It amazed me.<br /> The Grapes of Wrath doesn't have a very complex plot.  It actually doesn't have much of a plot at all.  It simply follows a family through a period of their life.
B0000DD7LB|5.0|This has to be the best pop CD produced in a long time!!  Every song is brilliant and offers something different to the listener.  Highlights are 'Breathe on Me,'  'Toxic,' &amp;  'Touch of My Hand.'  Don't hesitate to buy this CD, I guarantee you won't regret it!!
B0000CEB4V|5.0|Visually beautiful, musically satisfying. You couldn't spend your hard earned money on a better music DVD. I watch it all the time.

B00005JLYW|3.0|A film by McG<br />I started watching this movie with the expectation that I would absolutely hate it.  I had enjoyed the first \\"Charlie's Angels\\" movie, but the overwhelming number of negative reviews for \\"Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle\\" dropped my expectations to zero.  I didn't hate the movie, but I can't say that I really liked it either.  The content of the movie was about what you would expect.<br />The three angels, Natalie (Cameron Diaz), Dylan (Drew Barrymore) and Alex (Lucy Liu) are back and are still working for Charlie.  This time they are involved on a case that involves the FBI's list of everyone in the Witness Protection Program.  There are two rings, that when brought together, contain the codes to reveal the entire list.  This is very dangerous information to let fall into the wrong hands.  Naturally, it does.  The angels are trying to reclaim the rings and stop the bad guy.  They are given their missions from Charlie, relayed through Bosley (Bernie Mac).  You might remember that Bill Murray was Bosley in the first movie.  This Bosley is the step brother of Bill Murray's character.<br />When the first movie came out, it was silly, but it was also fresh.  \\"Charlie's Angels\\" did not take itself seriously, and it was a lot of fun to watch.  The fight/action scenes in the first gave us \\"Matrix\\" like effects, but it was done well enough, and appropriately enough, that it worked in the context of the movie.  This time around the Matrix-effect is used far too often, sometimes at inappropriate times, and it is used in such a way that the angels would give Neo and Trinity a run for their money.  We accept that the angels can do things that they shouldn't be able to physically do...but \\"Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle\\" stretches credulity a bit too thin.<br />There are some things that work in this movie.  The relationship between the three angels is a major selling point for the movie.  It seems like they are honestly friends, and it plays very well.  The character of Madison Lee (Demi Moore) is another strong point for the movie.  Madison is a former angel, one who left Charlie's employ but still bears a grudge.  Madison was the most interesting character in the movie, despite her lack of screen time.  The other interesting character was the returning Thin Man (Crispin Glover), but he wasn't really given anything to do.  Just when it looked like his character might develop, he was off the screen again.<br />The bottom line is that this is a fast-paced, silly action movie.  I didn't think it was very good, but at least I wasn't checking the clock every 5 minutes.  That's really the best I can say for it.  It was dumb, but it wasn't boring.  \\"Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle\\" will never be confused with a good movie, but it isn't the worst movie of the year, either.he character of Madison Lee (Demi Moore) is another strong point for the movie.

B00009V8Z9|5.0|This great new artist has star writing all over him. The lyrics are from the heart and his voice well it speaks for itself. I first heard him on &quot;One Tree Hill&quot; his song &quot;I don't want to be&quot; is the theme after that I was hooked. He has been compared to John Mayer but in my mind he his a much better voice. This is a must have for your cd collection. You will not be sorry you bought this one. Thanks
B000002UJQ|5.0|I must have bought these CD's out of order. I went out on a whim, and bought Hail to the Thief without having ever heard Radiohead before. That CD blew me away. I needed more Radiohead, stat. Luckily, I had a friend who was a closet Radiohead fan, but only owned Kid A. After listening to that, I was thrown for a loop. These CD's are all so different that I wanted to know what Radiohead's &quot;sound&quot; was. Do they even have a signature sound? After buying OK Computer, I would have to say no. But if asked what their sound was, I would definately point someone towards OK Computer before Kid A or The Bends. <br />OK Computer mixes Hail to the Thief/The Bends' sound (a more rock-tinged sound) with the strange, electronica ambience of Kid A. OKC keeps rock fans satisfied with great songs like &quot;Electioneering&quot; or even &quot;Paranoid Android,&quot; but hints at Kid A with &quot;No Surprises&quot; (An amazing song that sounds slightly upbeat at first, but after repeat listens, grows colder when listening to the lyrics about people living and dying without change or surprise in their life) and &quot;Climbing Up the Walls&quot; (One of my favorite songs of all time, it gives you the most paranoid, claustrophobic feeling sound with incredible lyrics to match). &quot;Let Down&quot; tries too hard to be catchy, but the lyrics are great. &quot;Airbag&quot; is a great opening song to grab you from the start, but serves only to set up for &quot;Paranoid Android,&quot; a 6 minute and 23 second assault of clashing musical styles that is gripping from the start. &quot;Subterranian Homesick Alien&quot; borders on being slightly too wafty at times, but stays strong with it's lyrics and pure atmosphere. &quot;Fitter Happier&quot; is great at first, but you can really only enjoy it a few times. &quot;Karma Police&quot; has got a great guitar section, but the piano is what kept me coming back. The CD ends on a low point for me, which is disappointing. &quot;Lucky&quot; is anOK song, but &quot;The Tourist&quot; completely bores me, and so the CD usually ends at &quot;No Surprises&quot; for me. <br />Many have said that this CD is too dark or soft compared to previous Radiohead outings, but after listening to Kid A, I think this CD strikes the perfect balance. Buy this CD first and see whether you like the slower, darker songs (For this, buy Kid A or Amnesiac), or the quicker rock songs (Buy The Bends or maybe even Hail to the Thief). Either way, you'll love THIS great CD.
B00005UKE0|5.0|This is the most beautiful album from George in his solo career.<BR>I feel George sings to both Beatles' end and to his new solo career and so some songs sounds sad while others are full of hope.<BR>I love specially these songs: Isn't It a Pity?, My Sweet Lord, Let It Roll, Apple Scruffs, Beware of Darkness, What is Life, All Things Must Pass,Behind That Locked Door,Run of the Mill,I dig Love,I'd Have You Anytime,Awaiting On The Wall, Art of Dying and Hear Me Lord. Isn't that enough? Many beautiful songs and just one album. I really recommend You buy it. You won't regret it. I would like not only give five stars but ten millions of stars to this George album.
B000099T2L|5.0|This album is d*mn good from the first to the last track.  Anyone who says otherwise is just HATIN' There is no doubt that this Houston native is very talented and it shows in her work. She proves here that she can't be put in a box she is very versatile.  I say keep up the good work and shake them haters off!!
B00005JMJ4|2.0|I found it difficult to identify with these rich, spoiled and oh so depressed characters. Movie relied too much on cheap gags at the expense of the Japanese. I found it hard to find redeeming qualities here. At least Wong Kar Wai's movies are beautiful to look at and have great soundtracks...
B00005JLEU|4.0|First of i would join the ongoing hordes of fans that will tell you this is a MUST HAVE film. You will no doubt have heard how utterly beautiful this is,that its a delightful story and you will marvel at the small tiny details that,on most animation films wouldnt have been added or even thought about, you WILL watch this over and over and notice more and more.<BR> I cannot rave about this film enough BUT...and heres the kick, it HAS been ruined by Disneys awful western dubbing-im sorry but it has! Disney/Pixar may rave about how they painfully tried to keep it true to Miyu's eastern version but thats the point IT IS AN EASTERN FILM!!its full of Asian characters and culture it should never have been dubbed. <BR> So i implore you,beg you,plead with you to watch this in THE BEAUTIFUL LANGUAGE IT WAS ORIGINALLY WRITTEN IN with the subtitles that way you will really appreciate the wonderful world of Spirited Away.
B00000JY1X|1.0|If this ever gets filed under&quot;rock&quot; anywhere, then rock truly is dead. Soulless genre-hopping from people who should probably stick to their IT jobs and not bother the rest of us. Other sensitive cubicle bound souls with no experience of life may appreciate it. Fake country, fake soul. The guy does a passable impression of Phil Oakey, but that's as generous as I'm going to get. After all, he's probably aiming for Leonard Cohen or Johnny Cash, and missing. Mind you, the title is so clever, eh? 69! Snigger, snigger.... If ever there was going to be an uprising against digital home recording equipment, this is the group/guy who'll trigger it.
B00007M5CO|4.0|This is not dancing music, so much as it is relaxed music. It doesn't purport itself as some new club-ready album, but as a new way to enjoy this type of music. It is an equal blend of tango and trance, quite nice for driving. I find some of the end to be sort of repetitive or perhaps a better way to put it is indistinct. It is an album worth having if you enjoy tango music and wouldn't be put off by it not being in its full intensity. This is the latin album I listen to on long winter drives.
B00008NRLX|5.0|One of Amazon's most helpful (and fun) features is the &quot;Customers who shopped for this item also shopped for these items&quot; section usually found in the middle of the screen of each item you view. This is an invitation to serendipity! If you are adventurous, you can click and find treasures you would otherwise probably never discover. This is how I found this cd.<br />Having no prior background of The Jayhawks, my review is not a comparison of their previous work, it focuses strictly on this cd. This is a beautiful piece of work. The style is hard to pigeonhole, but I would describe it as a combination of countrified-folk-rock. The songs are lyrically simple/basic, but the instrumentation has such a variety of sonic layers and the melodies are so classic that when combined, they become a feast for your soul. This really is rainy day music. The first time I listened to it was at work and I noted to myself &quot;This would be great rainy day music&quot; and then I realized that was the title! It is also great driving music, particularly when it is late at night and you are driving a minivan full of sleeping kids who are exhausted after a big day at Disneyland. This cd has provided a soundtrack for my contented moments, as well as my sullen moments. It's pleasant and unobtrusive. While I enjoy the cd as a whole, my favorite songs are &quot;Stumbling Through The Dark&quot;, &quot;Tailspin&quot;, &quot;All the Right Reasons&quot; and &quot;Save it For a Rainy Day&quot;. Get the Limited Edition w/Bonus CD if you can, so you can have six more tracks (some acoustic versions).<br />I suspect Ethan Johns' contributions, as &quot;Produced, Engineered, and Mixed by&quot; and instrumentally, are a big factor in the ultimate sound of this cd, so I am now going to skip along that tangent and find other Ethan Johns' productions, as well as devour other The Jayhawks works. All because I was willing to take a gamble with Amazon's recommendations. This cd will be a favorite inmy collection for a very long time.
0316666343|4.0|Sebold's novel The Lovely Bones is interesting and full of tragedy. It is about Susie, the main character, who is murdered by her neighbour. After her death she narrates her story from heaven.<br />She observes her family circle which has been broken:<BR>The mother leaves the family and falls in love with the inspector who investigates the neighbour, but the father also cannot move beyond the loss of his daughter.<br />We read the book in the 11th grade in Germany and we really enjoyed it. It is appropriate for school, because we could work with it for a long time. Furthermore, it is easy to read and to understand.<BR> <BR>Sebold presents a story which is full of sadness but she also includes irony e.g. by describing the way Mr. Harvey dies. She also depicts the characters' development who grow up and learn to live with Susie's death. <BR>You have to imagine and feel the story to understand the unusual atmosphere in the novel, but this book is not for everybody.
B00006RU5B|5.0|Deep, spiritual and insightful lyrics.  <BR>Passionate and well-blended music.<BR>What can I say?  I love it.  I get a headache every time, but I can't stop rockin to it.  Not recommended if you suffer from migraines (I do).   I heard it once in a friends car and I couldn't get enough of it.  My only problem is that the endings come a little fast for my tastes.
B0000CAQ27|5.0|The first Pink album I heard was \\"Missundaztood,\\" and I enjoyed it so much that I wondered how she could outdo herself in the future.<br />\\"Outdo\\" may not be the word I would use in \\"Try This,\\" because I find myself resisting comparisons between the two albums. Both are so hot, but so different from one another that if it weren't for Pink's unmistakable voice, I would imagine two very different works by two very different artists. <br />While none of the songs on \\"Try This\\" are remotely harrowing as \\"Family Portrait,\\" the over all mood of the CD is much angrier, much darker, yet oddly enough...I could listen to this album three times straight without finding myself feeling hollow and wrecked in that \\"Pink Floyd - The Final Cut\\" sort of way. There is enough energy and fight in songs like \\"Last To Know,\\" \\"Walk Away,\\" and \\"Waiting For Love.\\"<br />I liked \\"Walk Away\\" because it's really cool to hear music about a broken heart that has a future---not some giddy \\"That Was Yesterday\\" tune by Foreigner--- but a broken heart that still hurts, but is angry enough to give her ex the finger, and stomp through the misery toward an optimistic future.<br />Which brings me to the heading of my review --- entertainment has always had shock value. From the past underground folks like GG Allin, to Johny Lydon, to all the present day musicians and sportsters who boast that they do everything \\"EXTREME!\\" with lots of \\"explicit lyrics\\" chucked in. I usually listen/watch these thinking \\"Okay, I'm shocked, my eyebrows are raised, what's new?\\" <br />But from the very first, when I heard Pink upchuck foul-mouthed cursings, it was one of those rare occasions where I felt like the wicked lyrics really meant something. \\"God Is a DJ\\" has this awesome lyrical rise of conflicted feelings for family members, topped off with a brutal \\"Lover, hey ---- you!\\" WHY does this song work so well? Part lyrics, but mostly Pink's delivery. She spits out anguish and retribution like nobody else. WHATTA GAL!<br />Lastly, when listening to \\"Last To Know,\\" it dawned on me why I like Pink so much all in all. It's another seething tune bout a pop singer jilted by her guy after leaving him complimentary tickets to her gig. She's not strutting \\"I'm a pop Diva,\\" nor is she trying sell herself off as \\"Your everyday middle-American working gal who understands the common man.\\" Nope--- her tunes are about Pink, pop singer who can rant, get hurt, kick back, get angry, get a busted heart--- but she's still a singer who's got the power, who loves her offbeat life; in some aspects like an everyday Jane, in some ways up in the clouds, but always very much her own person--- only one PINK! Sorry if my adoring her comes off as corny, but I have become a proud mark for Pink!

B00005JLCE|5.0|I had read alot of mixed reviews about this movie and i think when this sort of thing happens, you need to watch the movie yourself and let you be the judge. I hired it from my local video store (because it is unavailable to buy :-( ) and i was really quite pleased with it. It really is just a light hearted comedy and Madonna plays a great part. Admitedly, her voice is a little annoying at the start but you get used to it after about 10 minutes. <BR>I fear that this movie is going to be forgotten and swept under the carpet just like some of her other unsucessful movies. Peerhaps warner brothers should think of all the money they would make if they did release this as a DVD and VHS! There are millions of Madonna fans who would do any thing to get a hold of it and wouuld pay almost any price!<BR>but any way this is an overlooked gem and its the sort of movie you jus have to sit back and watch. It doesnt require a whole lot of thinking and its just a nice little film. Dont listen to what the nasty critics said...they will do anything to bring down someone as successfull as Madonna! <BR>In conclusion a great movie! I look forward to see the DVD release!
B00008S2VG|4.0|I bought this album the day it was released back in April and have listened to it over 100 times at least.  I really enjoy the fact that It sounds so different from Madonna's previous work. <BR>Some Highlights include Nothing Fails, Easy Ride, Intervention, and Nobody Know Me.  The lead single American Life is an offbeat choice and a rather intelligent commentary on Madonna's place in the land of celebrity.  Die Another Day feels a little out of place because it was released 6 months before the rest of the album.<BR>The Four stars instead of Five is only because the album just didn't hit me as hard and wasn't as compelling as Ray of Light, Like a Prayer, or Erotica.  Though amazing, American Life is not as entracing as those three.<BR>Keep putting work like this out MAdonna, I'll keep buying!
B00006G8LB|5.0|It took many years to get this project done and it certainly delivers as not only a great super hero story but a great film in general that has something to please all movie-goers.  From Peter's relationships with his Uncle and Aunt, his persuit of Mary Jane, and the valuable lesson he learns when he abuses his powers (with great power comes great responsibility).<br />The special effects were amazing and the choice of the Green Goblin as the tortured Norman Osbourn was perfect.  Whatever you do, don't miss this one.  Really worth owning on DVD!
B0000C6E4D|3.0|What's changed:<BR>- Lyrics.  Far from her insightful, talented writing in the past, these songs are fairly trite and shallow.  They sound like...well, every other pop song on the radio.  Been there, done that.  Next?<BR>- Music.  Each song seems to sound just like the next.  There's none of the contrast found on previous albums.  <br />What hasn't changed:<BR>- Sarah's voice: She is still an amazingly gifted singer, with the same haunting voice.  I think she could sing a credit card bill and still sound good.<br />So, is it worth it?  The first time I listened to the CD, I was disappointed.  I actually found myself getting bored.  Not a good sign.<br />With that said, I still like the album.   It's not a bad CD, it's just not all that good.  It makes wonderful background music for work, etc.  The melodies, while not terribly interesting, are pretty, and Sarah's voice is...well, her voice.  ;-)  <br />Pick it up, but know what to expect.  This isn't classic, passionate Sarah.  This is, um, piano bar Sarah.  But still Sarah.  Always good.
B0000DD7LB|1.0|This girls music is an ofense for everyone! This album sounds just the same as the last 3 or 4...The worst part of it is that Madonna accepted singin with her, it seems she lost her mind and is leaving her crown someone doesnt deserve it. A total shame, and a total money waste. This girl is just made out of marketing and dumb scandals.<BR>I woul call this thing &quot;trash music&quot; or &quot;waste-of-time-money-album.<BR>Down with &quot;Bitchney Spears&quot;
B00005U18E|5.0|Rene Zellweger gained a few pounds and added a British accent for this role and she looks great!  Very enjoyable film about a woman who is thrust into some bad relationships, including one with her boss he seems to have no respect for her.<br />Her friends are great.  This movie has one of the best ending sequences of any film in recent memory!
B0000640SA|4.0|The movie is great, but the special features disc is the most obnoxious exercise I've ever done.  I navigated the mock psychiatric test for about an hour and only found two lame special features.  What a waste of time.  So if you're buying the limited edition for the special features, beware that you may never actually find them.
B0000DD7LB|5.0|i love the album. its much better then the others. my favorits tracks are: toxic , me agains the music , breve girl , and me againt the music in remix version. its a an album that keeps you up and ask you for dance. by it brit worthed.<br />ps: i love the new video of brit TOXIC best video yet.<BR>thanks for reed
B000001FS3|5.0|Ok.  I first heard this CD when I \\"borrowed\\" it from my dad many years ago.  I later bought my own.  In short, it is the best album that the world could have been blessed with.  The only word to describe this album is one made up by comedian Will Ferrel...and that word is...SCRUMTRALESCENT!  I read one terribly negative review and came to the conclusion that that person was deprived of any good childhood memories way back when.  I could go through each of the tracks and express their brilliance, but you just have to listen to it for yourself...please...go now...do yourself a favor.

B00005YW4H|4.0|Being the number one best selling cd I have no idea what to say that the other reviews haven't covered yet. Norah must be doing something right that others have not done. Her music is something original, something new on the already mainstreamed radio. When I fist herd her I fell in love with her voice. In a way she has the same style as Bob Dylan. They both have a way to calm you down.  It took me awhile to finally buy this. I'm not much of a jazz fan (I tend to like rock). Nara is one of the rare people that can cross over in to any genera. No matter what taste you have, country, rock, folk. You will love Norah.
6305161879|5.0|This is one of the funniest movies of the eighties and it is the last true hurrah for Monty Python.  John Cleese (who must have been about fifty at the time) wrote the script himself.  It is filled with great little catch-phrases: \\"It's K-k-ken coming to k-k-kill me!\\" and \\"Oh, do shut up, Porsche.\\" <br />It is basically a story of culture clash between modern England and America.  Cleese is voicing off about what is wrong with British culture.  Jamie Lee Curtis proves again here that she is a great comedic actress.  Kevin Kline deservedly won an Oscar for his performance.  (The two of them have the greatest love-making scene ever filmed!)<br />The DVD has no extras on it, but the movie itself makes it a definite must-have.  The transfer looks great and London never looked better.
B00009TB5G|5.0|\\"The Two Towers\\" extended edition surpassed all of my expectations.  It amazes me about the criticism I hear from fellow Tolkien fans. I think that people need to remember two things before they invest so much time into this movie:  a.) transitioning a story from novel to the screen is an arduous task, which rarely ends up doing justice to the original work and b.) when dealing with a trilogy, the middle chapter seems to always get the blunt of critic abuse.  The thing to remember is, that \\"Two Towers\\" is astonishing from all parts:  the story sticks with the novel, all the major characters are represented, the special effects seem all too realistic and the film makers go into each character's personality without loosing the focus of the action.  Of course, scenes had to be added after the theatrical release, because of the length, but sometimes, the smallest overlooked dialogues can really flesh out a character and make him/her worth cheering for.  I personally felt that Gimli, the dwarf, was overlooked in the first movie, but I was excited to really see him develop as into this personal character, who was powerful and secretly sensitive to his comrades.<br />I don't think this movie was \\"sloppy\\" at all!  A lot of viewers, especially the younger generations, haven't read through the books yet.  Well, if anything, Tolkien certainly mastered the art of creating a world and giving it its: mythology, history and politics.  One could even go so far as to say that he wrote an alternative history in comparison to both the World Wars.  This, of course, makes reading through the volumes of writing as much a chore as an enjoyable magical experience.  Its translation to screen however, is just short of a miracle.  One can watch this and have a decent concept of what's going on, who the characters are and where everyone is going - without having read the books and not being too familiar with \\"The Fellowship of the Ring\\" movie.  The several different story lines are all well explained and well developed. <br />As with the added scenes, if you didn't see the original theatrical release, you really couldn't tell where the new additions were put in.  In other movies, those transitions seemed awkward and you kind of wish they had just left them out.  It's the small details that really pack in a little humor and character bonds that help keep us invested in this war-torn epic.  The character of Golem was portrayed beautifully - as if great minds like Steven King and H.P. Lovecraft were called in for advice.  His mental instability really adds chilled and spooky premonitions on the viewers.  Also, we get a chance to invest in the humorous competitive friendship between the elf, Legolas, and the dwarf, Gimli.   <br />The middle chapter shouldn't be a let-down.  It should cherished along with the brave opening in \\"Fellowship\\" and will certainly carry us through to the ultimate conclusions of \\"Return of the King.\\"  There's no need to trash such fabulous efforts and ingenuity.  Sit down and enjoy!
B000059XUI|1.0|This is one of the best of the Superman films.  In fact, I'd put it on a par with the original.  Superman faces the twin conflicts of his love interest with Lois, and a trio of super-crooks who have escaped Krypton and are released from their prison by Earthly weapons.  It is therefore unfortunate that this DVD has been put out without care or interest.  Not only is the picture untidy, but I now have two versions of this DVD, and neither work properly.  In both cases, the screen kept freezing and jumping several minutes.  I then get an error message saying the DVD player can't read the DVD.  Do yourself a favour a buy this on cassette.
B0000DD7LC|1.0|Let's keep it simple and just say this album is extremely booring. <BR>Mediocre songs, repetitive, none of which held my interest at all.
068484267X|4.0|It's a miracle Frank McCourt survived all the tragedies of his upbringings to compose the story, Angela's Ashes. The memoir of his oppressed childhood demonstrated that life should not be taken for granted, the negligible things deserve appreciation. The story was vividly written making the reader able to emotionally feel the experiences of his misfortunate childhood. Born in Brooklyn he was the eldest of seven children, though only four reached the age of three. As the family moves from New York to Ireland in hopes of a more prosperous future the situations continually deteriorate. Living off the dole with random employment the family has just enough to barely stay alive. Poverty drives Angela to accept charity from the Saint Vincent De Paul Society while Malachy's addictive drinking habit nearly destroys the McCourt's. Frank related illnesses that occurred on his first communion and confirmation as bad omens and he hated carrying the sins of life upon his shoulders. This brought him to the assumption that the worse scenario of life was being brought up as an Irish Catholic boy. In Conclusion, Angela's Ashes was a realistic recollection of what life in Ireland was like for the poverty stricken population in the 1940's.  It was a well written book yet very depressing to read how anyone could have survived under these conditions.
B000002IST|5.0|I ofen hear bad things about this record, why? Let's just get one thing out of the way, SO WHAT GENESIS WENT MORE COMMERCIAL! It is still Genesis, the voice, the instrumental power, the epic songs, the melodies, the arrangments, but just because there not as far-out as the earlier stuff does not make it any worse, in fact newer Genesis had some very dark moments (see: 'Mama', a song about a teenage boy who wants to have sex with a prostitute he thinks is his mother, 'Tonight, Tonight, Tonight', a song about a herion addict despartly trying to find his dealer as he craves his drugs and 'Dodo/Lurker', the most surreal, sick and crazy song of the 1978-1994 period. <br /> All the above are all dark, brooding, disturbing and powerful songs, there all long ('Mama' 6:37, 'Tonight, Tonight, Tonight' 8:47 and 'Dodo/Lurker' 7:33) all have instrumental sections and are all pretty weird (just listen to how sick Collins sounds on 'Mama', espesscialy the line 'Can't you feel my heart'). So onto 'We Can't Dance', the last album with Phil Collins as vocalist/drummer. From 1980 on all the Genesis/Collins albums had a thematic sound, for exmample 'Duke' gave the image of snowy trees and leaves falling in the autum, 'Genesis' gives the image of a dark, steamy, industrial city and 'Invisible Touch' a dystopian future. 'We Can't Dance' is an album of lost love, innocence, time and people. Their is a strong sense of grief throught the album. <br /> From the opening 'No Son Of Mine' to the broken-hearted 'Since I Lost You' you get the feeling of grief and tradgedy. The veriation on the album spans from melodic, powerful rockers ('No Son Of Mine', 'Way Of The World) to gentle, regretfilled ballads ('Never A Time', 'Hold On My Heart, 'Since I Lost You') to the darker, epic, more like Genesis of old ('Driving The Last Spike', 'Dreaming While You Sleep', Fading Lights'. In 'Dreaming While You Sleep' (one of the best things the band has done) a man tries to come to terms with his guilt after he runs over a women on the rainy roads, lines like: 'In and out of darkness, In and out of sleep, Trying to keep my hands upon the wheel, Never saw the corner in the driving rain, I never saw her step into the street...' <br /> In short 'We Can't Dance' is, with the truely classic 'Abacab' the best Genesis album from the 1978-1994 period, Phil Collins, Tony Banks and Mike Rutherford again prove they are the best trio in music history...
0064407667|5.0|For a couple of years I have been hearing about a series of Young Adult books written by Lemony Snicket.  It wasn't until I taught a 7th grade Language Arts class this year that I was introduced to the first book when one of my students encouraged me to begin reading this series by lending me the first book, The Bad Beginning.  I felt compelled to read it immediately and was happy to tell both this student and others, including teachers how much I loved the first book and couldn't wait to continue reading the series. And having just finished Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, I did marvel at how children's and young adult books have changed over the years.  Gone are some of the very sweet stories I was used to and found them replaced with child wizards filled with angst and a group of siblings coping with being orphans as well as villains and terrible events in their young lives.<br />The blurb on the back of The Bad Beginning warns readers that the book they are holding is extremely unpleasant.  Readers are also warned that the book will reveal an unhappy tale about three very unlucky children, known as the Baudelaires.  And a sorry tale this book does tell although the reader is rooting that these children will overcome whatever befalls them.  It is a credit to the author that despite the unhappy events described there is a sense of fun and some very quick thinking on the parts of the children.<br />I did find this a fast and most enjoyable read. Particularly clever was the author's explanation of words and emotions that most children would not know.  Some of the explanations found me even laughing despite the serious nature of the Baudelaire children's dilemmas. I also marveled at how Lemony Snicket so easily puts you right into these children's world. And I particularly loved the character of each child and their own inventiveness for getting them out of trouble. And the villainous Count Olaf who quickly becomes the children's nemesis is just devilish enough to entice you to continue reading.<br />I recently finished the last book so far in the series, The Slippery Slope, and am now eagerly waiting for the next book to be published.  And as if that wasn't enough I have just learned that a movie from this series with Jude Law as Lemony Snicket and Jim Carrey as Count Olaf will be coming to the silver screen shortly.  Like other treasured series that children and adults alike can look forward to and remember, I predict the series of unfortunate events will have a long and happy future.to entice you to continue reading.<br />I recently finished the last book so far in the series, The Slippery Slope, and am now eagerly waiting for the next book to be published.

B00008H2LB|5.0|Linkin Park has done it again.They have created another great cd.It doesnt matter what these anti LP people think,linkin park is awesome
B000002B30|5.0|I am quite aware that this album takes its fair share of flack from critics and fans for not including some quintessential favorites, but I don't agree. First of all, this is not titled \\"The Best Of...\\", so it seems perfectly fine that Bruce opted not to include earlier works such as the always amazing crowd-pleaser \\"Rosalita\\" or \\"Blinded By the Light\\" or \\"Spirit in the Night\\" or....I could go on. The songs on this album are his greatest HITS (being the most important word), though, so work on his pre-\\"Born to Run\\" albums would not honestly make the cut. While they were two great albums, they did not provide sales to warrant anything close to a greatest hit inclusion. I also think that the songs chosen to be on this record mold perfectly together in a showcase of an overall summary of Bruce's work over the years. It flows in a way that it couldn't possibly with additional songs added in. If someone is just looking for a sample of the flavor that is Bruce, I think that this record is perfect for them. Anyone who wants to find out the true mastery behind the man with the Levis backside will, and they will discover the gems on his other records.<br />That being said, I do have a special attachment to this record because I was a first-time fan once, too, and this album was all that I had. I was ten years old when this came out and it truly opened up the door for me, so I could never write it off as being anything less than a masterpiece. This album was the sole reason that I bought my next and the next and the next until my CD collection had clearly been taken over by Bruce. And I look at this record as being that great stepping stone for someone else, not as a disappointment. I mean, we are his fans...how can we complain about \\"Greatest Hits\\" when we all probably own every other album anyway? We all have our individual \\"greatest hits\\" and most likely CD burners by now, so we should create our own disc instead of tearing his down.
B000089RVX|4.0|I agree with Very Overrated.It is not  a new genre.jUst a cool band with a different type of singer.I still like the Cd though.It is very interesting.
0385504209|1.0|As an occasional fan of the &quot;thriller&quot; genre and an avid reader, I was looking forward to reading this much-publicized book.  I was severely disappointed.  While some of the background information regarding early Christians and alternate gospels is interesting, it cannot begin to make up for the poorly paced and developed plot and the cardboard characters.  Even by the standards of mystery and thriller writing (admittedly not as high as the standards for the literary novel), this novel is badly written. Such popular novelists as John Grisham, Stephen King and countless other mystery and thriller writers are much better writers than Dan Brown. It is a sad comment on the level of expectation of the reading public that so many readers consider this novel well-written.
B000069CWE|5.0|Anything that Linkin park  makes is completley awesome.Some people *cough* to be remained nameless can't seem to tell the difference between songs.Reanimation is not a Hybrid Theorey Part.2 neither is Faceless by Godsmack.Somepeople cant understand the difference between genres. I love Reanimation because it is a different genre than Hybrid Theorey but the same songs.
B00005JM02|4.0|I was taking a nap the other day while my master was watching this. Pretty soon the movie had my undivided attention. I know it was a cartoon and all, but the underwater world is a world that dogs just don't get to see. The movie was so well done and looked so realistic (I am assuming anyway) that I almost couldn't follow the story, but the story was great anyway. If the folks at the Pixar studios ever do a story about dogs, you can bet I'll see it (I just wish theaters would let dogs in so I don't have to wait until they come out on video).
B0000027RL|2.0|its pretty cool but nirvanas better
B00008DDSC|4.0|This movie just FLOORED me! I am a big James Spader fan and Maggie Gyllenhaal (Mona Lisa Smile) gives a<br />  wonderful first starring performance... A young girl that has many life problems, wants someone to love her despite the fact and will stop AT NOTHING, even shaming & degradation doled out by her sad sack of a boss to get him to PAY ATTENTION to HER...  If you are looking for a real eye-opening, erotic, fetish FILLED movie, (without the usual gratuitous skin shots) then this is the movie for you.  Highly recommended as the whole ensemble turned in fine, fine performances. SMACK!
B000002J1S|5.0|For fans of Peter Gabriel, it is obvious &quot;The Lamb&quot; represents the end of the road in terms of being a member of a group. Compared to previous Genesis albums it is apparent he is reaching out beyond the stereotypical, of that era, let's pump out an album each year and take the cash mentality. Subsequent solo albums and success, especially &quot;So, Us and Up&quot; exemplify the desire on Gabriel's part to create and explore music for music's sake. As such the Lamb requires some listening before one can accommodate it. Like all great music, Beethoven's Symphonies, Tchaikovsky's Ballets for example, this album does not instantly appeal, however, once appreciated it lasts!
B00005ATQH|5.0|Kubrick's masterpiece of 1962 with James Mason &amp; Shelley Winters. It far surpasses in every way the 1998 remake (although I loved Jeremy Iron's portrayal of Humbert). Sometimes the imagination is more graphic &amp; shocking than what is able to be filmed (especially in 1962!).<br />Plus, the B&amp;W lends itself well to Nabokov's novel... Read the book!  It is MOST EXCELLENT also!
B0000DCGT0|5.0|I did not want to watch this movie.  I mean an old story about some horse?  Didn't sound like my kind of movie.  But it was a family gathering and I would have been considered rude if I had left, so I stayed and reluctantly started watching.  <br />WOW...I am so glad that I did.  This story of a heartbroken (rich) father, an excentric horse trainer, a lonely but persistent jockey and Seabiscuit (the little horse that could), will break your heart first and then raise your spirits!  Even if you don't consider yourself a history buff, and you don't like horses, by the end of this movie you will be at the edge of your seat yelling &quot;GO SEABISCUIT GO!!!&quot;  I don't know quite how they did it, but this movie will reel you in.  <br />Perhaps it is Tobey Maguire and his beautiful smile and incredible acting.  He makes you feel lonely, and hurt and skeptical, but then courageous and hopeful and brave!<BR>Or maybe it's the way Jeff Bridges plays the heartfelt, nice &quot;father figure&quot; who never gives up on Seabiscuit or Maguire.  Whatever it is , it works.  <br />Watch this movie, you will love it!
0679428895|3.0|Painstaking historical research brought to life in novel form. The main character is an engineer called in to repair an aqueduct.<br />Stuff about volcanic eruptions and decadent Romans vomitting at feasts so they can stuff themselves again -- this was obviously before the Atkins Diet! The point of this seems to be poetic irony -- the Romans 'erupt' then are erupted on! And, furthermore, since they're so decadent to just use food hedonistically, they are clearly guilty of the classical sin of hubris, so the eruption is supposed to be a kind of divine retribution, giving this blind act of natural violence some moral dimension. These are the literary fireworks that Harris has clumsily tried to embed in the text.<br />In a nutshell this is regurgitated, pre-chewed history for the easy consumption of those who haven't quite developed their own historical molars.
B00009M6VJ|5.0|Anyone who gives this movie less than 4 stars must have watched a different movie than I did.  I found this movie to be incredibly powerful.  I feel for David Gale from the very beginning when a manipulative student accuses him of rape and gets him fired.  He is a death penalty abolitionist (DPA) who feels extremely devoted to his cause.  Through a twist of scary coincidences his DPA partner ends up raped and killed in a horrible way, and he ends up the accused.  Put on deathrow, he will not talk to anyone in the press about it until 5 days before his execution.  Bitsy Bloom is then allowed the priviledged interview and led on a wild race against time to find out what really happened and prevent the execution.  If you feel things deeply this movie will make you cry. <br />WATCH THIS INCREDIBLE MOVIE!
B0000C6E4D|1.0|This album is a big disappointment.  I'm a real fan of Sarah, and have been for years.  Afterglow is boring, directionless, and self abosorbed.
B0000TB03W|5.0|If your one of the poor souls who can,t get to her tour this time around, don,t miss this chance to see the most talented singer songwriter out there today. This DVD has all the energy and excitement of the tour itself, no Shania fan should be without a copy! Shania just keeps going &quot;UP&quot;!
B000000WCV|5.0|Whaaa!!! Yeah!!!<br />Homework is all good. Homework is mostly Techno, but even those who hate Techno will like Homework because it is catchy and revolutionary as other reviewers have already reported. Homework actually made Techno mainstream for awhile and the beats will have you up and dancing around in no time.<br />To be honest I flung their other album Discovery out the window. I was totally disappointed that they had gone for 70s retro music instead of sticking to what they do best - catchy techno tunes that evolve the industry, however people might like that other one but I certainly did not.<br />Homework is probably one of the all time great Techno albums if not the greatest techno album of all time. It can easily sit beside Paul Oakenfold's Traceport as the best electronica/trance/techno/dance album out there but Oakenfold would probably be second best because he was just a DJ and these boys cooked up their own tracks.<br />In fact Homework stands out in a world of its own. It is almost like a compilation of all the best techno tunes but is in fact all original tunes from a very original duo.<br />This is a must for any collection. Even classical music listeners will throw this one on for the sheer originality of it all. Yes, Beethoven and Mozart would be proud!
B0000CFW87|5.0|I have been a Groban fan since I saw his performance of &quot;To Where You Are&quot; on Ally McBeal.  I went out and immediately bought the fist album, loved it and purchaced the In Concert DVD/CD when it became available.<BR>When I found out that the second album, &quot;Closer&quot; was due for release I marked my calendar!  I WAS NOT disappointed.  Groban's second effort has everything that the first album had and more.  I really can't say that I have any particular favorite songs, because the whole album is incredible.  <BR>Groban's voice is excellent at portraying a vast array of emotion in this album.  The songs &quot;When You Say You Love Me&quot; and &quot;Broken Vow&quot; are of particular note, while &quot;Never Let Go&quot; gives Josh a nudge in a new direction, which shows wonderful artistic growth.  All I can say is, BUY THE ALBUM, listen to it and prepare for something simply amazing...Trust me it doesn't get any better than this...until the third album of course!
B000059MEK|3.0|This is NOT in the least bit like &quot;Homework&quot;. It is almost devoid of any of the Techno that &quot;Homework&quot; had to offer. &quot;Homework&quot; is an ace album that is virtually flawless.<br />Here Daft Punk have decided on a 70s Disco revamp. If that is your thing then you will love it, but this is NOTHING like &quot;Homework&quot;. You have been warned. Many people who like Daft Punk hate this album through and through because it is just so 70s Disco and not Techno orientated at all. It did not deliver on what I expected from the team who brought us &quot;Homework&quot;. Just check out the variation in tunes by listening to it here on Amazon and you will see exactly what I mean.<br />I give it three stars for the fans of 70s retro music but for me this was a 1 star album, seriously.
B000000XBE|5.0|this album is the best in this world for a man like me. i spend so mucht time on road and this album was my best friend in intro the years. i lost it(the album),and i miss it.
B00005JM0B|2.0|T3 was a mockary of the other terminater movies.  this story is on a serous subjuct, and the other movies show this though the darkness of the movies, yet t3 is full of bad jokes. At least the did give a decent explanation as to why the could happen, though why would they send such an outdated version of the terminatior back?  basically the movie was just arnold's poor attempt to renew a dying career, hopefully he does better as governor
0446530891|4.0|I have not read many books...yet, but I totally enjoyed <BR>\\"Split Second\\".  It first started out with immediate action. Then the paced slowed a bit building up a plot of deception and mystery. I liked how the two separate stories joined together keeping me on edge. I was hooked by the last third of the book. I would recommend it for new readers!
0385504209|5.0|I have so far read 4 of Dan Brown's books (Angel & Demons, DaVinci Code, Deception Point & Digital Fortress) and three features of his writings stand out. First, audacious plotlines; Brown does not believe in small measures but goes out on a limb-  heck, this guy re-defines audacity! The plotlines are way over the top but have just that crucial amount of credibility to draw in a reader, even when he knows it is fiction. Second, the pace is mercilessly quick; the entire plot of the book plays out over a few days at most. Last but for me the best of all, his books have a wealth of esoteric information that one would not normally read about. I found myself enthralled by a never ending series of factoids that had me rushing to the Internet for explanation or elaboration. I like books that teach me something new, or even give me a new perspective on something I already know, and Dan Brown manages this easily.<br />DaVinci Code for my money is his best effort till date and it features all the above 3 characteristics. The mysterious death (and its perplexing manner) of a respected Louvre curator sets symbologist Robert Langdon and cryptographer Sophie Neveu (also the curator's granddaughter) on a quest whose twists and turns are guided by a series of cryptic clues. To reach their journey's quest, Langdon and Neveu have to solve the puzzles using history, language and ingenuity, while hard on their heels follows the killer, a misguided monk. I was totally enthralled in the cracking of the various codes, spiced up by Brown's customary dose of history and intrigue, art and artists.<br />I found the book absolutely fascinating. There have been complains that the book is anti-Catholic and about the accuracy of Brown's research. I am not qualified to comment on the research accuracy and while the Catholic Church does not exactly come off smelling of roses, well, this is classified as a work of fiction after all. Don't take it too seriously people, lighten up! This is not a research thesis but a novel. If it sets you thinking, fine, but mainly, it is an entertaining read with lots of interesting information, much (though not all of it) true.  Highly recommended.earch thesis but a novel.

B00005JLWN|4.0|The hype on both sides of the movie reviews (those who love it and those who hate it) are simply untrue.  No, this movie is NOT better than the Matrix, and nor do its gun scenes at the end put the Matrix police lobby gunfight to shame.  Yes, it IS a really good movie that has a great cast, a interesting story and a rockin ending.  This movie only cost between 20 to 30 million to make, but it does NOT have a B-movie feel to it. <br />Equilibrium takes place in the future, in which a totolitarian regime as banned sensing and feelings (everyone takes a daily feeling inhibitor) as a method for controlling conflict. Christian Bale truly steals the show in his role as the cleric John Peterson (basically a death dealer for the regime) who starts to doubt the system, but there are fine performances by Sean Bean, Angus MacFadyen and Taye Diggs.<br />The tension in Equilibrium increases as the movie progresses. The front end of Equilibrium almost has a Gattaca-like feel to it, while the back-end has some serious butt kicking, along with some Total Recall-like shockers.   I give it a solid 4 out of 5 stars.
B00005OAIE|4.0|I havent heard all of this cd, but what I have heard is pretty good. I admit, that i think its a little to teeny-bopper, poppish for my taste, but one thing made me take a more respectful look at John Mayer. I saw him on Austin City Limits with Buddy Guy and with Stevie Ray Vaughan's old band Double Trouble. He tore into some blues on that show. I was in awe. I never knew SRV was his main influence in music. Just for that, I give him 4 stars, just because of the blues influence alone....
B0000VAFO0|4.0|the movie is good popcorn entertainment.  the acting is mostly subpar, the storyline somewhat convoluted, and action too sparse.  there is no chemistry between kate and scott so there IS no love story aspect.  it IS a rip from the matrix, blade, the crow and a tad from the romeo & juliet concept.  the best part of the movie was kate's handling of action and guns (and, ouf course, better trinity and could even fill the shoes of aeon flux's main female.  weird watching a film knowing that in reality during filming she left sheen (lead lycan), whom she has a kid with, the suit).  she is extremely photogenic and would have made a and started dating the director.  humph, hollywood.  anywho, if you turn off your brain a little this will be a fair movie to watch.
B0000CABJ1|4.0|I love Donna Summer. Think her disco hits have been compiled to the extreme.  Check out her 80s hits like &quot;All Systems Go&quot;, &quot;There Goes My Baby&quot;, &quot;Supernatural Love&quot;, &quot;Cats Without Claws&quot;, &quot;Dinner with Gerwin&quot; and more. Her 80s music were more Flashdance-like. Hope WEA company would look into her 80s anthology someday.
B00008ADPF|4.0|I enjoy listening to Nickelback and think Chad Kroeger has that impactful, yet passionate voice that I never get tired of listening to.  My only problem is that when he takes that voice to an obnoxious, faster paced rock sound it starts to lose its luster - and this album shows that.  <br />I still think &quot;Someday&quot; is a truly great song and I bet that after radio stations stop playing it every hour, you will have an even deeper appreciation for the song.  It's a truly beautiful song.  I only wish more songs on Long Road reflected that emotion.  Too may fast-paced rock tracks here.  Not that I'm opposed to that type of sound, but I expect something more passionate from Nickelback.  <br />It's a decent record to have in your collection but if you own other Nickelback albums you will enjoy those more.
B00006690G|5.0|I am such an Eminem fan.  This CD is the greatest.  He is the best in the game and the best lyricist out there.  Me being an Eminem fan, I take as much critism at school as he does, but I don't care.  All I ever hear is &quot;Eminem sucks.&quot; He doesn't suck! He is very talented.  This CD proves it all.  He didn't rip off an Aerosmith sample.  The chorus totally goes with the song.  It's the same with Dido's chorus.  Cleaning out my Closet is also a great song.  I think that white rappers are going to be huge within fifty years.  I think they will take over the hip hop community because they are so much better at it, and you can understand what they are saying.  So, if you love Eminem, buy this CD and don't forget to download his new song We are Americans.
B000089RVX|3.0|I'll agree with most that this album is catchy, haunting, and has a moody vibe you won't find on most records except Type-O-Negative.  The one thing this album REALLY lacks is diversity.  I love Amy Lee's voice but I feel this album only captures a very small part of her capabilities.  It feels a bit &quot;packaged&quot; and most of the songs give off the same exact vibe which incidently gets old very quickly.  By the time I was done listening I felt like these guys got together for two weeks, wrote a bunch of songs, and instantly released an album quicker than you can say &quot;Wake me up inside!&quot;.  <br />It's not a bad album to have in your collection, but I don't think Evanescence is quite deserving of 5 Grammy nominations including album of the year.  I think most of us can think of several artists in the rock genre who released better albums than this throughout 2003. Then again, I know the Grammy's love bands like this because it's in &quot;the safe zone&quot;.  I only wish Amy Lee and the rest of the band would have ventured beyond performing all songs in the same key.  It wears on me quickly.

0060512806|5.0|This is probably the best book I have ever read. Even better, everyone I know who has read it has loved it. What more can I say? <br />Well, how about this: Cryptonomicon works on every level-from the broad, intricately-connected pallet of characters, to the playful use of language, to the perfect melding of documented history and dramatic action. You'll trot the globe, laugh so hard you have to stop reading, and probably look up a dozen words before you're done.
B000000WA2|5.0|With an aural depth only hinted at in prior releases ( and sadly subsequent ones), Blur took the themes of modern life is rubbish and parklife and gave them a darker edge.  All the while the hooks shimmer with a pop perfection that is rare in contemporary music.  This album is for Blur what Abbey Road is to the Beatles.  Perhaps not the best batch of songs they ever wrote (although not far behind Parklife in that regard) it is their most polished production.  Dated?  I think not.  This album stands the test of time which is what separates art from trendy fluff.  The pacing and flow are impecable with the right number of rockers, midtempo popsongs, and slow ballads.  The sounds are varied and original.  Blur has always had a knack for amalgamating their infuences into something fresh and original with a classic feel.  The Beatles are in there as is Bowie, Kinks, XTC and lots of others.  In the end it is Blur. A great album from a once great band.  I wish they could make another one this good.
0761536434|5.0|This book I read the summer before going to school to study video game programming and design.  I loved the fact that it chronicles the card games and peg board games which led to the invention of the Pinball machine (a modification of the pegboard machine made illegal due to it's ties to the mob in NYC, with flippers it is no longer a game of chance)<br />Speaking about it with one of my professors, a producer at Xbox, he said that it was an okay book, but is the product of the whole &quot;the victors are the ones who get to write the history books&quot;  - in other words, he thinks it is told from a one-sided point of view, the side of the manufacturers who did well.<br />I think it is a dynamite book regardless.

B000003TA4|1.0|I know most people will never agree with me, but \\"Nevermind\\" is responsible for my mistaken idea for so many years that what was classified as \\"alternative\\" basically is violent loud noise with equally violent lyrics if one can comprehend them.<br /><br />The record, overplayed on radio ever since its release was supposed to signal the end of the 80s, an era whose commercial music I absorbed for a number of years as completely as possible. Though critics' constant derision of commercial music of the 1980s does have some truth to say the least because so little (many would say NONE) of it has stood the test of time, this does not mean \\"Nevermind\\" is made any more worthy.<br /><br />The whole record, to my perhaps insensitive ears, was just a melody-free feast of guitar noise that really had little meaning even in the softer passages, which really disguise what the songs turned into during their tuneless choruses. The muted \\"Come As You Are\\" really was overblown stadium rock under another name, with Kurt's emotion really hiding his distaste for some sort of feeling towards those he refers to. \\"Smells Like Teen Spirit\\" was even worse, basically soulding like a slower version of hair metal like Poison even if Kurt's wanted his lyrics to be completely different. The verse-chorus structure was exactly the same as that of a power ballad like Heart's \\"What About Love\\" - only more amplified and detuned.<br /><br />Whilst the line (actually not the real lyric, but I heard it that way for years) \\"I kill you/What's that gonna change??\\" suggests that Cobain was so nihilistic he cares about nothing and nobody. The lyrics of the other songs are in many ways quite similar even in their correct versions, whilst there was never really anything distinctive about the music.<br /><br />If you really want to see some inventive, tuneful music from the 1990s, try Portishead's [[ASIN:B00000DLV1 PNYC]] or Laika's [[ASIN:B000006AZG Silver Apples Of The Moon]]. Alternatively, go to the roots and discover Laura Nyro or Sandy Denny-era Fairport Convention for a different ideal of rock music: dramatic expression and intense melody and true intimacy that makes you think about how the people in these songs really feel.Denny-era Fairport Convention for a different ideal of rock music: dramatic expression and intense melody and true intimacy that makes you think about how the people in these songs really feel.

0316666343|4.0|We read this novel in our English class in Germany. It was a little difficult to understand in English, but we found The Lovely Bones by Alice Sebold to be a sad and funny book at the same time. The beginning is also the beginning of the plot. Susie, who is narrating the whole story from heaven, is killed by her neighbour Mr Harvey. Susie uses very sensitive words to describe her familys feelings. There is no suspense but the story is so gripping that you cannot stop reading it, because so many things happen simultaneously. <BR>First, Susies death breaks the whole family. The mother escapes from her sadness and begins an affair. The father sinks in his loneliness, but there are very intersting developments, like her sister Lindseys relationships, and in the end they are all together and have accepted their loss. The story is very realistic except for the narrative perspective and it is free of irony except for Mr Harveys death.<BR>Sebold presents a story which is full of sadness, tragedy but also teeming with warmth and freedom. Alice Sebold wrote a fantastic book in which death is depicted in a tragic but also in a comforting way.
0380789035|5.0|I'm not usually a fan of urban fantasy but Neil Gaiman is changing my mind.  NEVERWHERE is very good, too, BTW.  This one is darker but more tightly written.  One minute it's hilarious, the next it's gross, the next it's unbearably sad.  The characters are wonderfully drawn.  The basic concept of the old gods living among us is really well done-- imagine the god of thunder committing suicide from depression, the father of all the gods as a con man.  Gaiman has obviously done his research; the details about the various gods add richness to an already rich story.  I'm putting up every thumb I have.
B00004XQ83|3.0|I have to say I was dissapointed with this CD. Although a few songs are worth my time, the rest just weren't my style. <br />If you're a fan of bluegrass, I HIGHLY recommend you get the Cold Mountain soundtrack and/or something by Alison Krauss instead of this.
B0000020C4|5.0|Fine performances one after the other, from the biggest stars of this wonderful, long-running musical.  What a treat!
B0000069NM|5.0|An easy listen all the way through- a friend once described it as something like sophisticated funky bachelor-pad music and that's not so wrong. There's a lot of subtlety that will grow on you, trust me, it's addictive and fun. Great for driving, chillin at home, sitting and thinking. It's feels less forced than some of Sco's later &quot;Jam&quot; efforts and MMW doesn't head for outer space here so it's a decent intro to their sound for the uninitiated. Flawless.
B00005JMF6|5.0|I was thrilled with this spectacular and intellectual horror film.  The scary scenes are along the same lines as those in \\"The Sixth Sense\\" but much scarier than any that are in that movie.  Halle Berry gives an excellent performance.  This is a smart scary movie which is hard to come by.  It has many twists and although I predicted the outcome right at the end, I was still very satisfied and wouldn't mind watching this film again and again.  It scared me and I'm a tough one to frighten.
B00000258J|5.0|Muddy Waters sounds looser here than I've ever heard him. This sounds like some friends getting together for a jam session at someone's home, with dialogue around some of the tracks, spontaneous-sounding vocal contributions from some of the musicians, and just a general laid-back feel. It's loud and raw, great jamming all around, and shows us that not only the young make great music. Waters IS the blues, and this is THE blues record. See if you can find it on vinyl if you're of that persuasion (I liek some thinsg better that way), otherwise it's damn cheap on CD. My local indie record shop was selling it for $8, and amazon's price is great too. Any price would be good for this one. Roll on, Muddy, wherever you are.
B000002G23|5.0|Now this is what a boxed set is supposed to be - everything in one place, good sound, nice packaging, and worthwhile extras - a set no one will ever feel bad investing in.<br />At the time of its release, _MIAB_ was an essential purchase for Police fans even if they had the albums on cd, because the sound was such a vast improvement. One could argue that its value has diminished somewhat since then, with the individual albums having been remastered, not once, but twice (no, I don't know why). But there is enough else here that this is still the best way to experience the group on cd (not to mention it's a significant price break). The booklet is loaded with information, nice glossy color photos, and an essay that doesn't sugarcoat anything. And let's not forget the extra tracks - &quot;Fallout&quot;, &quot;I Burn For You&quot;, &quot;Once Upon a Daydream&quot;, and Andy Summers' wonderfully deranged &quot;Friends&quot; are all essential additions to the Police catalog. If their greatest hits album isn't enough for you, you should consider shaking out your piggy bank and getting this set.
B00000099Y|5.0|Tool's &quot;Ænima&quot; is the album which gained them the recognition and respect as the top innovators of Art Rock today. One cannot fathom the significance of this amazing disc when juxtaposed against the present world of boring commercial acts. This was my first acquaintance to the phenomenon that is Tool, and I recommend to the newbies this particular album as an introduction as well.<br />The lineup of Tool consists of easily one of the most talented groups of musicians today. Ænima would be the first album featuring bassist Justin Chancellor, and after just a few listens, it's palpable to detect the natural chemistry among the members. Adam Jones is a very skilled guitarist, ranked at #75 in Rolling Stone's &quot;Top 100 Guitarists&quot;. However, the epitome of talent in this band lies in the drummer Danny Carey and the front man Maynard James Keenan. Carey has one of the most innovative drumming time signatures in present rock, which is actually shown more in depth on their later release \\"Lateralus\\".  And of course, Maynard possesses the best voice in the music business today. His vocals can be ethereal yet harsh, and range greatly from a whisper to a roar. The amount of skill in this band is simply undeniable.<br />However, there is only one small flaw in this album, the amount of filler. \\"Useful Idiot\\" consists purely of static and following track 5, one will notice that the actual songs are always one track away with some filler in between. Although \\"Message To Harry Manback\\" had a beautiful piano melody, other tracks such as \\"Cesaro Summability\\" and \\"Ions\\" could have been better off removed. \\"Intermission\\" is a unique little track featuring \\"Jimmy\\" played on an organ. But the most interesting interlude is \\"Die Eier Von Satan\\". Upon first listen, one may conclude that this is a Nazi rally when actually, the narrator is simply describing a deviled eggs recipe. This shows that the guys in Tool also have a sense of humor.<br />The first single \\"Stinkfist\\", was the song which gained them the most commercial success back in 1996. Although the lyrical content is incredibly explicit, the guitar hooks are just too mesmerizing to ignore. However, the album's highest points are in \\"H\\", \\"46&amp;2\\" and \\"Push It\\". These three songs exhibit Tool's skills in greater depth than others. \\"H\\" is a chilling, beautiful almost ballad-like song that captures the feelings of a dysfunctional relationship. Even though lyrically \\"46&amp;2\\" is perhaps the most complex, musically, it's more alluring and straight forward than the rest. The album hits its climax in \\"Pushit\\", an immense epic journey that will easily take one's breath away. Furthermore, an even extended version of \\"Pushit\\" is in the last song, \\"Third Eye\\". This is the hardest song to digest in this album, but when one finally endures it, the rewards will make it all worthwhile. <br />Although the production can initially be labeled as \\"muddy\\", one will eventually come to understand that it plays a big role in the overall atmosphere. The best suggestion for new fans is to be patient. Music like this with a plethora of different layers takes time. Tool's \\"Ænima\\" is undisputedly one of the most essential albums to own and proved it could withstand the endurance of time.
B00005JM02|5.0|This movie is so cute! It is touching, funny and entertaining all at the same time. Adults and children can all equally enjoy this film. <br />GET THIS FILM, it is really good!
0060278250|4.0|Even though I no longer fall in the catagory of young adult, I loved this trilogy. It's dark and facinating and the library that Nix created, one where librarians carry emergancy whistles and swords, just an awesome idea. Nobody thinks of libraries as dangerous places.<br />Abhorsen picks up right where lirael stops (rather abruptly, I might add. Drove me nuts waiting for Abhorsen)and brings the story to a satisfactory conclusion. My favorite was Lirael, the Disreputable Dog was wonderful, and Mogget, well, I'll never look at my cat the same way again, and maybe it's just as well she can't talk.  Every book was well written and original. I would definitly recommend these books to ANYONE who likes fantasy. Be sure to read them in order, you might be a bit confused if you don't.
B00005JMCN|5.0|Look, everyone.  Don't believe the negative reviews for a second.  This is a terrific, albeit imperfect film.   The cinematography is breathtaking at times, and the soundtrack by Randy Newman is inspiring.  Jeff Bridges is convincing as are Chris Cooper, Tobey MaGuire, and William Macy. Oh, and the horse that plays Seabiscuit is pretty darned good too.
B00005JMF6|3.0|The story is \\"Gothika\\" is just silly. I know that movies are not real life, but the story in this movie was just plain dumb. The best part about the movie were the preformances, which to tell to the truth saved the movie. Yes, the movie was scary. There was at least two parts in this movie that made me actually jump, but sometimes just a couple of jumps can not make a movie be good. I had those other critics that judge a movie because it is stupid and does not focus on story and just the power to scare people. But I really think that was what this movie did. I guessed the ending before it happened, and during the scene where we learn about the ending, it was made pretty clear what was about to happen. I only wish that mabye they could have made the ending a little more of a surprise. <br />Halle Barry was the star of \\"Gothika.\\" In it she works at a prison for women. She is currently working to help Chloe who murdered her stepfather, and claims that she was raped by The Devil. One night she says goodbye to her husband/boss Doug, and is walked to her car by co-worker Pete. On the way home she learns from Sherrif Bob that the road ahead of her is closed, and while taking a detour home by passing a bridge, she sees this young girl standing in the middle of the road. She gets out of the car, and the young girl goes on fire, and Miranda blanks out. <br />Three Days Later...<br />Miranda wakes up in the very prision that she works in. Only she is an inmate. She talks to Pete and finds out that she has been accused of brutally murdering Doug. She has no clue what happened after the problem on the bridge and nobody believes what happened including her now fellow inmate Chloe, because everybody thinks that she is crazy. Everything that she did to the people that she studied is no happening to her. Miranda is getting a taste of her own medicine. One night however she wakes up and finds a creepy message being written on the fog on the glass of her cell.<br />\\"NOT ALONE!\\"<br />Miranda gets scared, and when the girl from the bridge begins appearing in the prison cell and beating her up, Miranda  knows that she must escape the prison cell and find out what is going on, only what she finds out she might never want to know because it affects her in two ways...on an emotional level and on a very very personal level.<br />\\"Gothika,\\" was a scary movie, yes. But sometimes just being scared in a horror movie doesn't work out. You have to be interested. I hate horror movies where you know what is going to happen. That was the problem with \\"28 Days Later,\\" it was veyr predictable. I really liked horror films this year like \\"Darkness Falls,\\" because I never saw anything like that before. \\"Gothika,\\" was very much like \\"Dreamcatcher.\\" I only gave \\"Dreamcatcher,\\" two stars but that also had a cheap storyline. I wish they would make more horror movies instead of focusing on being scared every three seconds. Horror movies can also have a great storyline, which is what \\"Gothika\\" doesn't have. I liekd it, but it could have been alot better than the final product was.<br />ENJOY!<br />Rated R for violence, brief language and nudity.
B000002C1V|1.0|It actually s#cks much better than a Hoover.  Anybody who rates this album with 5 stars either needs serious consultation with a Psychologist, or consider it a soundtrack album to an imaginary movie called &quot;Suicidal Tendencies&quot;.  The Final Cut is the worst album by anybody at any time.  It is dreary, drab, gloomy, depressing, morose, creatively desolate (to say the least), which are the best compliments I can think of.  It is made up mostly of throw away tracks not included on The Wall - legitimate since its imaginative, insightful value is right up there with flushing a loaded toilet.  It wasn't Pink Floyd, it was Roger Waters, who had assumed control of the band in the joyous method of coup d'etat.  It was a painfully obvious love affair with Ego.  Is there a better way to sell one's personal creation (even if it's musical sludge) than with the name Pink Floyd on it?  Would anybody have rated this album 5 stars if it was by an unknown band called &quot;Chucker and the Upchuckers&quot;?  At the time, if I were with Pink Floyd, I would have presented Mr. Waters with 2 options: either take a very long walk on a short pier, or go to the nearest highway, turn left, and never come back.
0452282152|5.0|Griet is a teenage girl living in the 17th century city of Delft Holland.  Her father can no longer work as a tile maker because he lost his sight and the family is in need of money.  So they find Griet employment as a live-in servant in Vermeer's household.  The scenes are short.  The characters are not deep and the town is narrowly depicted through Griet's life of laundry, shopping and cleaning.  <br />The only luminous part of Griet's day is cleaning Vermeer's painting studio.  She must clean, but take care to place every item back precisely where it was.  Griet doesn't mind.  She has had practice cleaning and replacing items in their exact place for her blind father.  But most importantly, she gets an opportunity to look at what Vermeer is painting.  As time goes on, she eventually assists Vermeer with the preparation of paint colors and the more time she spends with him, the more she comes to admire and long for Vermeer and the imaginary world he creates on canvas. <br />In the real world, Griet's family struggles. Her younger sister becomes ill, her brother toils as a tile maker's apprentice, and her parents scarcely make do. The butcher's son is courting Griet and a future as his wife is a realistic match and an improvement from her current situation for both her and her family; a butcher's son would ensure that they do not go hungry. <br />Vermeer produces several paintings in this novel including a portrait of Griet wearing a pearl earring. I recommend being able to take a look at the artworks mentioned in the book. I found myself referring to the 2 on the cover and I looked at the Procuress and others when I was reading about them. The entire book is unsurprising in plot and character, but satisfying nonetheless. It felt as if only the necessary details were left in the novel crafting a sparse and finely formed story that I easily enjoyed. I will certainly be reading more of Tracy Chevalier.

This CD is very different from Odelay, being more sad and mellow.

B00005QZWI|5.0|This is the best soundtrack since the Original Star Wars Trilogy!  Howard Shore weaves the main theme of the movie throughout several songs and provides one of the more intelligent scores in years.  Ignore those that have said the main theme is not on this disc, I think they were confused as to what the main theme actually is.  The theme is in about 6 songs.  Even a non-fan can pick that out!  Make sure to buy this CD...it is incredible.
B0000C7PSW|5.0|I don't know what it is about this perfectly crafted album but it sure is addicting. I feel like I go through withdrawals if I am not listening to Want One.  The album is truly epic in scope. And typical of Rufus, there are songs that fall into different genres. There is Cabaret (Natasha, Dinner at Eight), Baroque (Vibrate), Classic Rock (Go Or Go Ahead), Tin Pan (14th Street), Rock Opera (Beautiful Child) and a lot that are genre-bending.<br />Want One is different compared to Rufus' first two records. While his debut and Poses were quirky and different, they were not as imposing and in your face as this one. Let's be blunt, this album hits you hard when you first listen to it but the shock lessens overtime.  This is the top album of 2003 as far as I'm concerned.
068484267X|5.0|Frank McCourts ANGELA'S ASHES relays the adolescent hardships of a poverty-stricken life. This novel serves to portray the aggravation of an alcoholic father who spends the little money the family has on alcohol, and ultimately leaves the family completely penniless. An underlying idea of the novel shows the satiric view of the Roman Catholic Church in which McCourt was raised. Throughout McCourt's lifelong struggle to save enough money to return to America, he faces many and is confronted with many problems in his everyday life. The novel brings to life the inhumanity of the life lived in poverty, with the natrual regularity of death and disease, and the despair of having to steal for food to live. McCourt adequately relates his views of the difference between classes, his view of pompous Irish schoolmasters, and his idealistic view of America. This is a heartening yet sometimes depressing read that allows the reader to relate to the overall strife of human existence, and shows the extraordinary will to succeed of a young boy trying to overcome his circumstances with dignity and character. McCourt's novel is inspiring, though-provoking, and heart-felt.  This novel is a must-read. It is a literary jewel.
B0000CEB4V|5.0|I bought this DVD as a Christmas gift for my husband. With our two college-aged daughters home for the holidays we all watched it and were enraptured by it! I can't say enough for the fabulous music, the wonderful performances, and the bittersweet joy that is encompassed by this DVD. We watched the 2nd disc, the actual concert, everyday for 14 days!! The section &quot;George's Band,&quot; is absolutely the best music I've heard! The mix of artists and music is visually rich, and the sound of 3 drumsets, an orchestra, and many guitars is overwhelming! Definitely buy this DVD, watch the 2nd disc first, and I promise you will love it!
B000002IAZ|4.0|In Superman's Bizarro World everything is reversed.  So it was with Buffalo Springfield.  While some refer to this band as a 'supergroup', such as Blind Faith, they were really a collection of emerging artists who, instead of coming together in their prime, broke apart to establish their true claims to fame.  This is the band where Stephen Stills and Neil Young, and to a lesser degree Richie Furay and Jim Messina (who together later founded Poco), honed their artistic styles, and rather tentatively dipped their toes into the waters of stardom.  Ironically, it was Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young, featuring two members of Buffalo Springfield, that eventually became the quintessential 'supergroup'.<br />Buffalo Springfield are often characterized as a pioneering 'country-rock' band, and while they certainly helped develop that genre, they were much more.  Stills and Young were never awkward about delving into inspired rock and roll, and Richie Furay and Jim Messina contributed a soft-rock alternative, so the band had a very diversified feel.  The 'Retrospective' collection does a good job of exploring these territories, although it unjustifiably focuses too much attention on Young's experimental psychedelia ('Broken Arrow' and 'Expecting To Fly') which is marginal at best.  A serious omission is made in selecting these numbers as opposed to Stills' fine composition 'Questions' from the 'Last Time Around' LP.  <br />Stills and Young do all the songwriting on this compilation, with the exception of Furay's 'Kind Woman', which sounds more like a laid-back Eagles composition than most laid-back Eagles compositions.  Stills and Young both offer a trio of classics, opening with the biggest and only hit the band ever had, the youth protest anthem 'For What It's Worth', which rose to number 7 on the national charts in 1967.  The song is still a real treat, especially in the stereo version offered on this CD, which separates out the vocal harmonies nicely.  When the song was released as a single, it included \\"(Stop, Hey What's That Sound)\\" after the title, since the words \\"for what it's worth\\" appear nowhere in the lyrics.  Without the parenthetical documentation, many would not have associated the title with the song.<br />Still's other standout contributions are 'Bluebird' and 'Rock and Roll Woman'.  Together with 'Questions', 'Bluebird' represents the best of Stills work with Buffalo Springfield.  The song is a tapestry of electric and acoustic guitar virtuosity, with the lyrics woven seamlessly throughout.  It segues unpredictably into a banjo coda for a melencholy concluding verse. It is highly representative of all the best work Stills has produced.  'Rock and Roll Woman', for some reason, always impressed me as a precursor to 'Suite: Judy Blue Eyes', and I've often wondered if Judy Collins, who inspired 'Suite: Judy...', also inspired 'Rock and Roll Woman'. It's another gem, only slightly less dazzling than 'Bluebird'.<br />Young's contributions are impressive as well, and a foreshadowing of where he was bound as a solo artist.  'For What It's Worth' is followed by the driving guitar strains of 'Mr. Soul', which had every right to be a Top 40 hit.  Young also contributes the orchestrated ballad 'On the Way Home', and the timeless 'I Am a Child', which has only gained credibility and an auditory patina over the decades.<br />The remainder of 'The Best of Buffalo Springfield' (a name reportedly lifted from the back of a parked steamroller) consists of lesser fare.  Stills 'Sit Down, I Think I Love You', and 'Go and Say Goodbye', though featuring pleasant vocals, offer only rudimentary melodies and lyrics.  Despite its shortcomings, 'Sit Down...' does feature all three of the Springfield's guitarists (Stills, Young, and Furay) weaving a nicely wound melodic bridge, and the interesting use of the word 'you' as a hinge between two verses (check it out!).  Young's 'Nowadays Clancy Can't Even Sing' is similarly a cut below the capabilitieshe would later exhibit in a stream of songwriting prowess which continues strong today.<br />For myself, this collection and the CD 'Last Time Around' are essential componants of a Stephen Stills collection.  Unless you are of a mind to purchase the Buffalo Springfield box set, which is a bit more than I was personally looking for, both CD's are necessary to collect the best of Stills' early work.  As a bonus the fine Neil Young selections make the entire collection a very pleasant listen.  Since we are generally inundated with these artists later works, hearing them in their genesis is an ear opening experience.
0783222955|5.0|Every so often, as surely as night follows day, a film comes along that manages to transport us from our everyday lives and into a time and place that is recalled through memories of better and in a reversal of fortunes, turbulent times. To Kill A Mockingbird is such a film.<br />In a Pulitzer Prize winning novel by Harper Lee, the small town of Macomb, Alabama is portrayed in the summer of 1932, during the deepest depression that the United States had ever experienced. Over the course of the next year and a half, events will burrow inside this sleepy southern town and the lives of its residents will be transported by actions, ideas, perceptions and convictions that will influence one and all in ways that will ring true for years to come.<br />Atticus Finch (Gregory Peck) is a lawyer and widower, raising two small children, Scout (Mary Badham) and her older brother Jem (Phillip Alford). Into their lives enters a visitor, Dill (John Megna) from Meridian, Mississippi, come to spend two weeks with his Aunt Stephanie (Alice Ghostley). Macomb is a town with nothing to do and if there were, no money to spend on it. The stage is being set for a life shattering episode that will not go quietly into that good night. <br />Childhood holds its fascinations, its myths, its coming of age and through the eyes of the three children, the audience is allowed to peer into the adult world around them as perceived through the minds and souls of innocence that will be all too easily shattered as time whistles down the track. One of the stories woven so masterfully within its covers is the local urban legend of bogeyman, Boo Radley (Robert Duval), who lives on the same block as the Finch family. In a narration, rather like playing telephone, his persona takes on all the familiar attributes of a raving lunatic, a monster out for blood. His aura becomes the end all for Scout, Jem and Dill as they seek to master the mystery surrounding Boo and the ability to live to tell the tale!<br />Intothis world of innocence, a shattering crescendo of complexity wraps itself in the lives of the townspeople in the form of an alleged rape of a white woman, Mayella Violet Ewell (Collin Wilcox) by a black man, Tom Robinson (Brock Peters). Atticus Finch is called upon to act as counsel for Robinson and in doing so, the stage has been set for a dance with race relations and the exemplary lengths that are gone to in order to allow justice to prevail in the face of malcontent.<br />The performances throughout To Kill A Mockingbird are stunning. Gregory Peck, as the gentleman lawyer, mired in small town attitudes and thoughts that were so representational in the southern gothic sphere, has collected and held a restrained order to his character, and in the process, he has allowed us all to be on the receiving end of hate as conveyed through the actions of small minds and small people. The children, especially Mary Badham, are siblings of more than a movie making venture. They show the absence of preconceived notions, and the guile of beings before the actions of adults can render their world as lost and gone with the shedding of time.<br />James Anderson as Tom Ewell is the complete representation of oily slime as Mayella's father. He embodies all of the hate and prejudice that continues to be harboured to this day in the souls of those who would attempt to wield their vision of the way things should and ought to be. He has a foul baseness that lingers like a bad rash as he attempts to invoke his arguments through drunken bullying and hatred. Collin Willcox as Mayella is excruciatingly convincing as the bored, housebound white woman who tries to tempt Tom Robinson into kissing her and through her actions sets in motion a rollercoaster of tragedy to come. Her speech to the assembled courtroom is superb and as the audience, you feel her anger and resentment at having to be put in such a position, having to lie to save face and what little position she has in the town. BrockPeters as the aforementioned Robinson is equally sure in the allotted time he spends on the screen. There is a noble demeanor to his bearing, and yet we are aware of the restrictions that blacks were held to in their relationships with whites at the time.<br />Robert Mulligan, the director and Horton Foote, the screenwriter, have presented us with a look into our pasts and faithfully etched a portrait of quiet and artfully rendered proportions that draw us into the canvas and the lives of those assembled. We have walked a mile in their shoes and been under their skin. Foote worried about being able to do justice to Lee's novel, but he worried for nothing. He has completely evoked an era that now rests behind clouds of dust, blown by the winds of time into oblivion.<br />The cinematography by Russell Harlan and the set decoration by Oliver Emert carry us back through the courtesy of black and white to a depiction seen only in old photographs and clouding memories of those who lived in those precarious times. Black and white films seem to have had a curse thrust upon them by the younger generation today, as boring and tedious, but through the courtesies extended by Harlan and Emert, we are richer for those perceptions that would harken back throughout the pages of history.<br />Elmer Bernstein's film score carries us like an old friend and helps us to make our acquaintances with the characters held within this framework. He has achieved much with a simple theme and persuades us that said simplicity is fulfilled with less rather than more.<br />To Kill A Mockingbird is beautifully haunting and having been made in the 60's, at the height of the Civil Rights movement, it garners our attention to stop and take the time to truly 'see' what the human race is all about and what it can and should be, if taken over the bumps in the road and onto a path of sincere honesty and purpose. No special effects were needed, no huge Hollywood budget, no splashing of a story that had ahappy ending for everyone involved. It is an open book into the realities of a world tilting temporarily off its axis, and being brought back on track through the goodness that sits in the hearts, minds and souls of mankind, if given half a chance.<br />See it and be amazed at what real moviemaking is all about.
B00006CXXU|5.0|I don't really have alot to say like most of you, but what I do have to say is very important. This is the Christina I have been waiting for. This is by far the best CD Christina has ever made and possibly will ever make....and it is the best CD I have listened to by any Female Artist! The CD is very moody...Some songs dominating against men, some emotional. <br />Christina's voice and the way she sings her songs is the reason I think she is by far the best female artist I can think of.
B00001ZWBQ|5.0|This video is very much like the album of the same name. I have given details of this concert for the album(see the ONE NIGHT ONLY CD). However,the playing time of this video is just a bit longer than the album itself. I remember from the concert,not the album,that at one point,Maurice introduced the band. One participant was Barry Gibb's son Stephen. This is one of a handful of concerts that was both seen and heard by those who were or were not in attendance at Las Vegas,Nevada's MGM Grand Hotel and Casino on November 14,1997. The Gibbs were promoting the STILL WATERS album released six months earlier. Too bad there was no video version of HERE AT LAST,the Gibbs' first live set,recorded in 1976.
076790592X|5.0|This year for my seventh grade Language Arts class, we were supposed to choose a book and then critique it.  I chose Tuesdays With Morrie after selecting it from a dusty bookshelf in my brother's room.  Personally, I loved the book; it had a deeper meaning of life that i had never considered before.  Some of my favorite quotes from the book have stuck with me like the one, \\"Love eachother or perish,\\"  The book is about a former college student, and his favorite professor.  It all begins sixteen years after graduation when Mitch Albom finds himself watching his beloved college instructor on Nightling with Ted Koppel.  Morrie has become a victum of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), also known as Lou Gehrig's disease, leaving his body withered and sagging.  Mitch visits Morrie one day and what starts as a reunion of old friends turns into the project of a lifetime.  Now, I don't want to spoil anything, but the lessons that Morrie teaches to Mitch on their Tuesdays together will stay with him all of his life.  I would recommend this book to anyone.  If you are looking for enlightenment, deep thinking, and a true story, you've come to the right book.  On a scale from one to ten, i would give Tuesdays With Morrie a nine and a half.
B000002NBY|4.0|GRACELAND is Paul Simon's fourth album since he signed with Warner Bros. records. The WB predecessors are the soundtrack to the 1980 movie ONE TRICK PONY,which he starred in,THE CONCERT IN CENTRAL PARK with Art Garfunkel and HEARTS AND BONES. Of course,in Simon's personally penned title track,he sings about the late great Elvis Presley's Memphis,Tennessee mansion. It was recycled for the LP version of the follow-up compilation,NEGOTIATIONS AND LOVE SONGS 1971-1986(the CD and cassette does not have it). Also recycled for the compilation were the megahit YOU CAN CALL ME AL and DIAMONDS ON THE SOLES OF HER SHOES. Simon's interest in African culture and music inpired UNDER AFRICAN SKIES,a duet with Linda Ronstadt,and HOMELESS. There's also the cajun-flavored THAT WAS YOUR MOTHER,GUMBOOTS and ALL AROUND THE WORLD OR THE MYTH OF FINGERPRINTS. All the other songs are good. This album won Simon a few Grammys in 1987.
0393317552|3.0|I liked the book but it took to broad of an approach to looking at the role disease, location and food on society.  I would suggest Plagues and People by William H. McNeil as a suppliment/replacement for his chapters on the role of disease on society and on horizontal vs vertical migration
B000001EYW|5.0|STILL WATERS was the last all-original album recorded by the Bee Gees in the 20th century. It was released on May 6,1997 as was MIDDLE OF NOWHERE by another brother act,Hanson. ALONE opens this album. The same song opened the live follow-up ONE NIGHT ONLY with a preceding introduction which was an excerpt of YOU SHOULD BE DANCING. The title track was expanded to STILL WATERS RUN DEEP. CLOSER THAN CLOSE features the now-deceased Maurice Gibb's lead vocal,also heard on ONE NIGHT ONLY. All the other songs are very good. By this time the Bee Gees had one or two websites of their own,the addresses given in the CD and cassette booklet. This is also the last album released on Polydor,the same label that re-released the Gibbs' albums originally released on the defunct RSO(Robert Stigwood Organization) label,including the soundtracks to &quot;Grease&quot;,&quot;Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band&quot;,&quot;Saturday Night Fever&quot; and &quot;Staying Alive&quot;.
B00008H2LB|5.0|I'm a huge fan of any Linkin Park cd so you could say im biased but this cd is great along with Hybrid Theory. It's a great follow-up to Hybrid Theory and everyone who enjoys rock and Linkin Park should buy this cd now!!!
B00006IU73|5.0|I got my hands on this CD right after it came out.  I am a huge PT fan and have been for quite some time, but believe it or not, I could not find this CD in my local record shop! If people in America only knew what PT does to you when you listen to one of their recordings--WOW!  I mean, I love Pink Floyd with a passion, but PT is now in my CD player on a more routine basis. It is now time to shut down your computer, go to the store and get this CD. If it is not in stock, scream at the manager and demand overnight shipping! I'm serious....power down and get in your car....BYE!
B000089RVX|4.0|Evanescence at first took on the Christian band scene and I do not know why they chose so but I am certainly glad they did.  Not only does this cd reach into your soul and amaze you with the ability they have of relating themselves to you.  Yes, some of these songs you can only relate to if you have been depressed before but im sure everyone has been depressed at one time or another. All in all this cd is touching with songs like &quot;My Immortal&quot; but also has a rock kind of feel to it with songs like &quot;Bring Me To Life&quot; and &quot;Going Under&quot; and with songs with a mixture of both such as &quot;Everybody's Fool&quot;. I strongly suggest everyone listen to this cd and give them a chance before judging them by the way they look on the cd.
B00008PW2D|4.0|I think that the 5th season was very well done.  Ok, so there wasn't as much sex, oh no!  I was disapointed that there were only two discs, but they were very well done.  The episodes were not always easy to watch, but they were very realistic and well done.  Major props to HBO as always.
B00004Z459|5.0|I love this cd with a passion! Linkin Park shows how rock is these days without all of the cussing that many other groups feel they have to use. Linkin Park is an awesome group who has always been able to pull through times of no music with great cds and always leave us waiting for more. I think this cd is fabulous and everyone that I have told to listen to this cd has never regretted it. I suggest everyone buy this cd or at least listen to it before you make judgments about the band.
B000063DI9|4.0|It has been interesting to read the disparity of opinions held about this album.  I bought this CD when it was released and have always enjoyed listening to it, but for some reason I have not yet familiarized myself with this band's other work.  Thus, I can't put this particular album in any context when it comes to the history and evolution of Iron Maiden.  All I can do is to comment on my own appreciation of each of the eight songs collected here in and of themselves.  By my count, there are five really good songs and three absolutely great songs on this album; you won't have to go reaching across the dash to find the Next Track button when you have this CD rocking you down the road.  My favorite has always been Can I Play With Madness. The band jumps right out at you from the very start with an a cappella delivery of the question at hand before proceeding with the heavy rock instrumentation.  The lyrics are quite catchy, and the idea of playing with madness is not a novel concept to my somewhat abnormal mind.  Infinite Dreams may really be the most impressive track here, however.  The words of this song really carry a deep if not philosophical meaning, as the subject at hand deals with life's ultimate meaning.  Seventh Son of a Seventh Son is the third true standout track on the album; it is a lengthy musical tour de force that conveys the image of the ultimate archetypal battle between good and evil, helped immeasurably by a segment in which the lead singer speaks as if he is reading from some ancient tome of sinister origins.  <br />The remaining five songs, as I said, are all keepers as well.  Moonchild gets the album off to a terrific start, giving us none other than Lucifer himself making threats of Biblical proportions while conjuring up the musical accompaniment of screaming mandrakes.  The Evil That Men Do has the listener balancing on that razor's edge and taunted by the inevitable truth that the evil that men do lives on and on.  The Prophecy warms thecockles of evil's black heart, while The Clairvoyant's metaphysically potent chorus takes the listener to a plateau inhabited only by the most psychically formidable (or disturbed) of minds.  Only the Good Die Young is probably the weakest song on the album, but its seemingly endless refrain that only the good die young while the evil seem to live forever stays with you as you go out to interact with the denizens of an increasingly bewildering world.  I don't know where the music on this album stands in terms of Iron Maiden's formidable musical discography, but I do know that these eight tracks are certainly most agreeable to my dark soul.
B0000B3FCX|5.0|This cd is one of the best I've ever heard.  It's a classic with all rock songs..I'll admit one or two are a little scary if you actually listen and comprehend the lyrics but it is none-the-less a great cd! This band does a great mix of rock and punk in a way and makes a great cd to listen to anytime anywhere.  I love the cd and recommend it to everyone!
B00005JL3A|5.0|Resident Evil is a stylish ride, a battle between the festering evil let loose inside the Hive, a high-security Umbrella Corporation research facility; the Hive's system defenses; and the few, the unlucky few, the terminally unhappy few trapped in the Hive who need to go in to discover what has gone wrong and then find a way out...<br />I can't attest to its faithfulness in translating the video game franchise to film.  It does succeed in being attractive, stylish.  Michelle Rodriguez (seen on the cover next to Jovovich) rocked, giving one of those performances that will make you remember her name and look for her elsewhere.  Milla Jovovich delivered, refashioning herself again so that she looked nothing like she did in The Messenger or Fifth Element, balancing her character's vulnerability with ferocity and sex appeal.  The male characters were, for the most part, short-lived and forgettable.  Not that they gave poor performances, just that they were (mostly) supporting roles that doubled as h'ors-douvres.<br />The special effects were good.  The computer controlling the Hive 's defenses -- The Red Queen, seen in the trailer -- made a good character in the movie.  Resident Evil made good use of the state of the art for 2002-3.  The music melted into the movie, adding to the action sequences without otherwise interrupting the flow.  Action sequences were nicely choreographed.<br />Resident Evil works.  It goes up, it goes down, it goes around and around and comes out ... and then you see the trailer for the next installment (the cosmetic ad) and you line up for the ride all over again.
B0000CFW87|5.0|Josh Groban's new album is indescribable.  Listening to him not only takes my breath away, but leads me to another world where I can just forget about everything else and listen to his amazing powerful voice. It relaxes me.  I have never come across such a beautiful artist.  His last album was extraordinary, too.  Unfortunately, all his concerts are sold out, but I'm sure it would be an awesome experience.
B00003CX8T|5.0|First, the good news.  \\"Aladdin\\" is scheduled to be the next in the Disney Platinum Series of deluxe DVD packages, and will be released in October 2004 (I'm getting my info from the packaging of \\"The Lion King\\").<br />Now, the better news - having seen this charming movie on many occasions, I know it will be well worth the wait - especially with a decent Dolby 5.1 mix.
B000005Z0G|5.0|This album is completly astonishing.<br />The best intro song to a album i heard, &quot;Holler if you hear me&quot; is what rap should be, not any odd rapper could flow to this song, Eminem has a fast rap speech, but i still couldnt see him doing any good behind this, and 50cent doenst come near, &quot;Point a finger&quot; is very good, the amaizingly structured rhymes go perfectly with the beat, love that song, Last words has a brilliant beat, i think cypress hill got influance from this one. &quot;PEEP game&quot; is a hhhheavvy track, the lyrics arnt that strong, it just sound amaizing when he first goes &quot;Goody, goody, gundrops n**ga get your hoody.....&quot; keep your head up is one of the best songs ever made lol, but it doesnt suit the album, the rest of the album is fast paste, dissin and this one is slow and incurriging to gals, &quot;I get around&quot; is very very very good the tune. the rappin, digital underground, everything its just a amaizin track, &quot;PAPAZ SONG&quot; is a truelly stunning track, the lyrics are sad, true and quility, the last song i dont like, dunnoy 4.8/5 then :P. reccomend this 2 all
B000003C2U|5.0|Well, I couldn't say since I only have Sound of perseverance along with Human, but i'm making it a priority to get the rest!<br />Wow...that's really all you can say after listening to Human. Especially with the line up, Chuck Schuldiner-Songwriter,vocals,lead/rhythm guitar,Steve DiGiorgio-fretless bass,Paul Masvidal-lead/rhythm guitar,and finally Sean Reinert-drums (the last two being ex-Cynic members). This is one of the best line ups in metal that i've ever seen!! All being gods at their instruements. Chuck is such an amazing songwriter(this being his first that he wrote all of) both heavy,melodic,catchy,intricate,and just plain brilliant!! Not one bad song is on Human, but i'd say flattening of emotions is the best though. this is a definetely a must have...words do no justice...<br />R.I.P. Chuck-you still live through your music!!!
B000001Y16|5.0|This album is brilliant. &quot;2 liv n die in la&quot; is the best song he has ever written, completly beutauful. This album is more or less perfect, but there is one thing missing, DR DRE, i hate to hear 2pac diss him, when he made one of the best beats for him (cali love), the best are very good, but i think one dre beat would of made this gold.<br />all the songs are good in there own way, cant be bummed to write bout em
B000002GK1|5.0|The greatest Soundgarden album ever, in my opinion.  Every song is just full of great impactful instrumental manipulation.  It's an obvious must for any Soundgarden fan, as well as grundge fan.
B0000DD7LC|5.0|Alicia Keys is the best entertainer out here lyrically, vocally, and her piano skills.  She is a beast at what she does and her first and second CD's were good... i enjjoyed both of them. But to like her origanl style of music you have to have class and have to also like jazz music. If you have neither then you wont like her.  The girl is good.
B0000CEB4V|3.0|Having read other reviews that gave 5 stars, I didn't realize how many Indian music buffs there existed in America. Otherwise, it would be impossible to give 5 star rating. I naturally started with Disc 1, which presents the entire show as it proceeded,,, only having to put up with Indian music for the first one hour. I knew George was really into it, but not his fans for the most part. Disc 1 also contains some non-Beatles/Harrison music by Monty Python and Tom Hanks, which I see no connections with Harrison. Nonetheless, it was a pleasant surprise to see now aged Billy Preston, hammond organ player who participated in the Get Back session when he was much skinnier. With Billy, Ringo Starr and Paul McCartney's presence, I would have loved to hear them play Get Back, though they didn't. It would have been a good tribute song to George.<BR>My advice is to start with Disc 2, which is much better edited for those who are only interested in Harrison's tunes. Then you might be better prepared for Disc 1.
0385504209|5.0|This book was captivating.  I couldn't put it down.  I have always been a fan of art, and historical fact and religious misgivings...and this book delivers all of this and more.  The secrets uncovered are startling because this could all be true.  The chapters are short and well placed events keep you intrigued.  In fact, as soon as a finished The DaVinci Code, I ran out to get the other book with the same character, Angels and Demons.  It is just as good!  So never fear, even when you get sad that there is no more DaVinci Code to read, Dan Brown will give you more opportunities to envelope yourself in the chaos that is his artistry.  GET THIS BOOK!!! You will not regret it.
B00009V7P8|5.0|This album is absolutely amazing.  I have been listening to it for three months now and I'm still nowhere near being tired of it.<BR>My favortie song from this album changes on a daily basis, depending on what mood I am in.  However, I would have to say that my favorite songs at the moment are &quot;Cannonball&quot; and &quot;I Remember&quot;.<BR>This is the best album that I have bought in years, a must have.

1573226521|5.0|I had chosen this novel for a school project with some early scepticism. After reading only a few dozen pages I was hooked.  This book is fast paced and always twisting the projected outcome.  Please don not base this book on the movie, for it is much better. <br />I would reccomend this book to all readers looking for an interesting adventure.
B000003C2S|5.0|Death never produced two records sounding the same. Here we have the 3rd album by this inventive band from Florida. It's their last performed in traditional old-school death-metal style (the successors moved towards technical and progressive death). It has lost some of the uncontrolled fury of the 1st record by Death, but instead shows Chuck Schuldiner's growth as a musician, composer, lyricist and his understanding of himself as an influential person.<BR>As has become standard for Death, the musicianship is top-notch. The vocals are Chuck's original higher-pitched growl, now Death's trade-mark.<br />I think that of dozens of death-metal bands all over the world, there are a scarce several worth getting acquainted to. And there are really few, that deserve listening to all their records. Chuck Schuldiner's Death is an eternal #1 on any death-metal list.
B000069AUI|1.0|bland, boring music. they are now cashing in selling their junk to tv commercials cause they know the end is near.
B000003TA4|5.0|Why did I bother to write this review? It could only make sense if it was 1000th. Perhaps, I should have waited a couple of days.<br />Anyway, I won't go deep into describing music on this records, because if you've spent the recent decade not in caves of Tibet, then you perfectly know what Nirvana's interpretation of grunge is.<BR>But what makes sense for me is stating that this record is a perfect example of how well the sincere emotion, depth, and passion can substitute instrumental perfection and compositional intricacies. It's as simple as rock'n'roll can be - drums, bass, guitar and voice. But it manages to touch something deep in your soul and leaves you thinking about this record, remembering it, knowing it to the note after 13 years of listening to it.<br />This is one of music's finest hours. Stop bashing Kurt for his popularity with teenagers. That was not his intention, I think. Just listen to the record and try to wear shoes of a very emotional musician.

B000002LQR|5.0|This is not exactly treading new grounds, since by the time this record was released, the funk-metal movement had been already developing for some years. But this is funk-metal done right. No flaws, no filler, no nonsence. Just track after track of quality, and very diverse material. Sometimes mellow, sometimes fast, funny or sad, this album takes you on a funky ride. Band-members are highly proficient with their instruments, too. Especially Flea's bass is memorable. And Kiedis' vocals add that special easily recognizable touch to the music.<br />Essential in any collection.
0062502182|5.0|Paulo Coelho's The Alchemist is a personal favorite of mine. By using a simple fable and compelling story, Coelho effectively forwards his evocative philosophies on life and living.  To cast his books as too simplistic or not practical is to totally miss the point of the work. I think that there is a reason I, as a 16 year old, and all my friends have enjoyed the book.  We are still young enough and malleable enough to appreciate the beauty and power of Coelho's prose and message in such a simple parable.  So if you are the type of person who despises the busy-bodied, goal oriented society we live in and yearn for the simplicity of bygone era, or you just need three hours of compelling, life changing philosophy, I recommend you pick up a mug of hot chocolate and curl up with The Alchemist.
0345440900|2.0|If you read this book, don't take it too seriously. i am a first time mom and I read this book just before i had my baby. I thought it was great untill my baby was born. The author wants you to put your child on an EASY( Eat, Activity, Sleep, Your time) routine but I didn't want to put her on a routine right away, I wanted to cuddle my child and let her sleep on my chest and have her sleep in my bed and hold her all the time and feed her when she wanted it. I was enjoying my baby. When my child was about 1 week old, I figured I should get started on the routine. The author suggests that you should keep track on paper every time your child eats and sleeps and for how long. I did this for one day and it was the worst day of my life. I got so upset because she was feeding for 20 min, sleeping for 15 min, eating for 10 min, sleeping for an hour. She was in no way following the eat every 2 hour routine the author states you should follow. She says that if it hasn't been 2 hours, your kid shouldn't be hungary. I was devestated because i felt like i was doing something wrong and my life would forever be ruined because my child would only fall asleep after eating and she would wake up when i put her down. The author basically states that you should never rock or cuddle your child to sleep cause if you, they'll never be able to learn to sleep on thier own. Infants want and NEED to be held. They have been inside you for 9 months, they are used to being close to you. My child would not stay sleeping unless i was holding her and this book made me feel like that was wrong. I said screw this book, i am doing my own thing and after a couple weeks, my child was able to stay sleeping when I put her down. The good part of the book is how she says to treat your child with respect, use it's name, explain what you are doing to them and be gentle. I also like the part about bathing and infant massage.
031286504X|5.0|This awesome book spawned the entire end-of-the-world by undead genre, it is without a doubt a _must_read_.  It's short, but a fun read.  The loneliness of the main character is very tangible and his situation is rather scary.  What I loved most about the book is the subtle commentary on those in power write history and how under one set of social rules you may seem like a hero while another set you are nothing more than a monster yourself.
B0000TB01Y|5.0|ok, that's a strong statement, but this show was beyond words.  Idina and Kristin gave two of the best performances I've ever seen, and the score and lyrics are Schwartz at his best.  Just listen to Defying Gravity and you'll know what I mean.
B00004BZ16|4.0|I got Sandinista! today, I loistened to it as soon as I got it home. All I can say is ouch, my head hurts. I tried to pretend my skip button wasn't there, but couldn't help it. If I force myself to like it I will, it worked with Combat Rock. Well now I am listening to the The Clash's early stuff. What a contrast!! SO if you think London Calling is too out there, THIS IS NOT FOR YOU!!!! If you like one type of music don't bother, you'll listen to maybe 4 or 5 tracks. If you like the reggae punk pop disco hip-hop rap dub what ever else Jonesy and Strummer wanted to through in, you'll love this album.
B00005A1PR|4.0|I wouldn't really call this album &quot;acoustic&quot; it's more perfect Stevie Wonder style R&amp;B mixed with an acoustic tone. The album came out at the right time, just when young talented singer-song writers were lacking. India.Arie came out with her daringly different debut single and album. <br />Just from &quot;Intro&quot;, &quot;Interlude&quot; and &quot;Outro&quot; you can tell there's something special here: a simple acoustic melody with a mellow honest voice that's ever so blissful to hear. <br />Her first single, &quot;Video&quot; is a daringly different R&amp;B ode to self-love, which maintains calmness and confidence. A very special and inspirational uplifting classic that incorporates some high-thinking and daring lyrics. <br />&quot;Don't want your silicon/I prefer my own&quot; <br />&quot;Brown Skin&quot; has a harder beat and is also very experimental/different. It reminds me of hot chocolate dripping. &quot;Strength, Courage &amp; Wisdom&quot; displays a God-ly India, and has a humble message, which though not said is about Jesus. &quot;Nature&quot; with its irresistible melody and instruments also includes a message about God, and is very logical and philosophical. <br />Though the record does at times fall into mediocrity on &quot;Always In My Head&quot; (even with her amazing vocals in the chorus), &quot;I See God In You&quot; (even with its rhyming poetry) and &quot;Part Of My Life&quot; (all three have good themes, lyrics and music). It bounces back with songs like the mellow, honest and real &quot;Ready 4 Love&quot;. You can feel India's emotions and frustrations and desires. &quot;Promises&quot; and &quot;Back To The Middle&quot; with their unique character examples. And off-course the Stevie Wonder dedication, I'm kind of surprised she didn't use an excerpt of the bridge on &quot;Pastime Paradise&quot; like fellow Motown/Neo-Soul artist Erykah Badu. Guess both of them are originals. <br />With this credible and unique debut, India.Arie will always be one of my favorite artists, also partly because she is humble, calm and honest. She is a high-thinker, godly and spiritual but doesn't comprise that pride. Though India.Arie has been recognized for her talent, she still is overlooked. Because she is about the entire album and not radio airplay, it will take time for new fans to discover the absolute brilliance of this musical mind. <br />Her song &quot;Video&quot; should have been rewarded a Grammy for &quot;Record of the Year&quot; and the album was also robbed of &quot;Album of the Year&quot;.
B0001CNRSE|5.0|This movie is totally awesome. Jessica Alba shines. I really love her. I liked her in her series Dark Angel.You should definitely check this movie out.

0380977788|5.0|Coraline discovered the door soon after moving into the new house, a very old house. Her family shared the house with a crazy old man who lived upstairs and two old ladies who lived downstairs. <br />They were definitely old and strange. They had many strange stories to share with Coraline and the old man would always talk of his mouse circus which Coraline could never see. <br />Bored with her own world, Coraline goes on exploring to find that through the strange door in her house was a whole new world awaiting for her to explore. In this new world, beyond the door she found everything was similar to her own world and life except strangely tweaked. There is another mother and another father that looked very much like her own except with freakish features and they wanted her to stay there with them. <br />Coraline's exploration turns into a fascinating and scary journey of talking cats, mice that play music and dance and creepy parents that aren't quite right. She has to fight to figure out how to get back to her real parents and the world that she once thought so boring and ordinary. <br />Coraline is easily enjoyed by children and adults. With it's imaginative characters and exciting plot, this is a page turner that will scare and excite readers until the very end. <br />Gaiman's creation of wonderful characters is incredible and well thought out. The spooky and beautiful illustrations by Dave Mckean help pull the story together and the reader even further into the story. It is no surprise that this New York Times bestseller has been called magical and declared the new Alice in Wonderland. This is a fairy tale that will not be forgotten.
B0000TB01Y|5.0|I have been in love with this show since I first heard the music on December 25th. I recently had the opportunity to conduct a production of Schwartz's &quot;Children of Eden&quot; and the score to &quot;Wicked&quot; is definitely on the same level. A more mature score than &quot;Godspell&quot; and &quot;Pippin&quot;, this show involves intricate themes, rhythms and melodies.<br />Like &quot;Eden&quot;, Schwartz uses small, yet recognizable themes to help tell the story of the two witches of Oz. If you have an ear you'll notice that the opening number &quot;No-one Mourns the Wicked&quot; is PACKED with small occurances of these themes. A good composer and a phenominal orchestratior make the score to this show such a pleasure to listen to... even after many hours of listening.<br />I've heard that this show plays to the younger audiences; that the music gets in the way of the story, etc.  To those I say - it took the creative team over 5 years to complile the book and music. And - why ignore the younger generations?  I'm 22 and well versed in the shows of both old and new musical theatre. Is this a show that your grandmother will love because the &quot;corn is as high as an elephants eye&quot;?  ... probably not. The people my age (22) are the ones who will be the theatre patrons of the future.  BRAVO for giving them something to rave about!<br />This is a SMASHING success for Schwartz and I can't wait to go see it on Feb. 14th!... and I can't wait to hear what's next from him!

B0001CCXZW|5.0|I have been watching Gilmore Girls since the very first episode.  Ever since The First episode aired all the way back in 1999 I have been in love with the Characters, Town, and writting of this heartwarming, yet comical tale of a Mother and Daughter (Who are the fastest talkers in the east) Growing up together in a small New England Town (which has residents to rival those of Northern Exposure's Cicely).  At the time of this writting the show is in the middle of it's fourth season and it still hasn't lost its luster (and there is no end in sight).<br />In the First season we are introduced to Lorelai Gilmore (a 32 year-old mother of one, who runs the Independence Inn, and has a \\"stressed\\" relationship with her parents), and Rory Gilmore (16 year-old daughter of Lorelai, who is very intelligent for her age).  The Two characters seem more like best-friends then mother/daughter, and they love each other very much.  During the first episode Rory is acepted to Chilton, a private school which will give her a chance to to fulfill her dream (attend Harvard).  But there is a problem, Lorelai cannot afford the tution: Inter Richard and Emily (Lorelai parents, who have a very ugly and colorful history with there daughter).  Richard and Emily agree to pay for Rory's schooling if the girls agree to come to dinner more often (52 times a year, instead of once).<br />Throughout the first season we are introduced to a hole cast and extremly quirky and lovable characters sucha s: Luke (the owner of the local coffee shop, and Lorelai's best friend), Lane (Rory's best friend, and daughter to the most religious Antique store owner in history), Kirk (a 33 year old man, who has bad social skills and skill lives with his mother), Babett (the next door neighber with a heart of gold, but that isn't necessarly a good thing), Miss Patty (ex-Broadway dancer and local \\"know-it-all\\"), and last but certainly not least Taylor (The local buissy buddy that needs his nose in everybody's buisness).<br/>Throughout the First season the girls will come to grips with many struggles: Rory moving to a new school and realizing that she won't be accepted with open arms, Lorelai coming to grips with her parents which havn't been in her life for many years, A girls first love, a girls frist enemy, and the search for the best cup of coffee.<br />This First Season DVD includes all 21 season one Episodes which are: Pilot, The Lorelais' First Day at chilton, Kill me NOw, The Deer Hunters, Cinnamon's Wake, Rory's Birthday Parties, Kiss and Tell, Love and WAr and Snow, Rory's Dance, Forgiveness and Stuff, Paris is Burning, Double Date, Concert Interruptus, That Damn Donna Reed, Christopher Returns, Star-Crossed Lovers and Other Strangers, The Breakup - part 2, The Third Lorelai, Emily in Wonderland, P.S. I Lo..., and Love Dasisers and Troubadours.<br />Included on the DVD are the Following Special Features: Gilmore Girls Beginnings - a documentary including interviews with the show's creators cast and crew, Gilmoreisms - A montage of the Witty comments coined on the show, Gilmore Goodies and Gossip - fun facts popup throughout the episode 'Rory's Dance', additional/deleted scenes, and more.  The Episodes will be in fullscreen, 1.33:1 formate, with English Stereo.  Also included are English, French, and Spanish subtitles.<br />This is a pretty nice \\"first season\\" set for a pretty nice show, from the masters of tv-on-dvd (Warner Brothers).
B00005JMTN|3.0|Confession: I'm a Tim Burton fan. His superb visual sense, bizarre sense of humor and unique vision have resulted in such personal favorites as \\"Edward Scissorhands,\\" \\"Ed Wood\\" and the more mainstream but beautifully excuted \\"Sleepy Hollow.\\" Oh yeah, and he did right by Pee-Wee Herman and Batman. I came to \\"Big Fish\\" wanting to love it, encouraged by excellent-to-rapturous reviews.<br />Unfortunately, the melding of fantasy and reality just doesn't work. The fantasy elements are overdone, while the reality segments are underdeveloped. This central conceit of the film works against it, as does the erratic casting - I didn't believe for one second that Billy Crudup was Albert Finney's son, an insurmountable problem for me - Jessica Lange is wasted, and only Ewan McGregor is both properly cast and impressive in his performance. The finale, which aspires to be tear-inducing, falls flat because we never really see Crudup's character going through the process of coming to terms with his imperfect father - he just does a final-reel turnaround to provide a forced \\"audience-pleasing\\" and predictable finale. Chalk this one up with \\"Mars Attacks\\" as a Burton misfire - ironically, the bigger a Burton fan you are, the less you are likely to enjoy \\"Big Fish,\\" while those turned off by Burton's eccentricities will probably relate to the superficialities of this film. Three stars for craftsmanship and McGregor.
0446677450|5.0|My son will be graduating from college soon. I bought this book for him as a graduation gift. I read a review a while back and thought it would be a good gift for a young man starting out. A young man who was raised by a &quot;poor mom&quot;. I've have read the book my self and have been applying some of the knowledge with in to my own life. I think my son will enjoy it. It is surprisingly a fast read. I don't usually read books on &quot;aquiring wealth&quot;. I'm more into books on spirituality. But as I said, it is in my opinion, a great read.
B00006BTCA|5.0|I bought this cd after reading some shining reviews about it.  At first, my favorite song was &quot;PDA&quot;.  After listening several times, tracks #5 &quot;Say Hello to the Angels&quot; and #7 &quot;Obstacle #2 &quot; became standouts. The excellently unique lyrics like &quot;friends don't waste wine when there are words to sell&quot; are one of their best attributes.  As many others have said before, there is some serious channeling of Joy Division, Echo and the Bunnymen, Jesus and Mary Chain, and a dash of the Cure. This is a good thing. However, if you don't like these bands, chances are you won't like Interpol. Overall, I think this cd is one of last year's BEST, and well worth $14. Very refreshing to have someone like them come along when there is so much radio-friendly crap being put out today.

630280082X|5.0|With the honourable exceptions of biopics about the great composers (Amadeus, Eroica & Ken Russell's splendid oeuvres) I can think of no other general release film in which the soundtrack is so inextricably linked with the dramatic development of the plot (and please don't mention Eminem & Britney!...).  This is no tacky attempt to boost revenue with ancillary album sales but a symbiosis that turns the music into an almighty, invisible member of the cast.<BR>Crossroads has that blurring of the historical and the mythical that fuels the best-told stories.  There is no moment of the film - understated or over-embellished - that jars with another: the scenes flows seamlessly from the intimate to the epic. <BR>Such a measured ensemble performance... Macchio's studied commitment to verisimilitude in his guitar fingering puts all those sham method actors to shame: not since Danny Kaye played Red Nichols has there been such a performance: it is easy to be brilliant - it takes genius to fake it.<BR>And the denoument? There need be no shame in predictability (The Day Of The Jackal, A Night To Remember, Serpico, The Insider).  In an age when one can get seven-shades-of-s*** in 5.1, it is wicked to allow irreplaceable films of this calibre to become ghosts of memory, de-magnetised, chewed by pinch-rollers.  Where is the repository for such gems as this: how will we save them; remaster them; DVD them?  If the Devil really does have all the best tunes, we shouldn't let him get away with the best movies too.  This one-in-a-million film is deserving of preserving.
B0001CCXZW|5.0|I just came to my email box and there was something that i have been waiting for.A alert email from our friends Amazon.com letting me know that the first season of the Gilmore GirlS is coming out on dvd.This is long overdue.And now the wait is over.<BR>And i wanted to be the FIRST to review this more then remarkable television series that is FINALLY getting the due that it more then deserveS.This is a great tv series in the classic sense.Great chemistry between the actresses and actors.And unlike a lot of shows this is more like real life.This show shines in every way possible and then some.The shining star of this show is the young actress Alexis Bledel.Whom i think is one of the most beautiful most aexy actresses we got today And without a doubt one of the most talented.Alexis is about 19 when she started this show so she is part of the club that is playing younger then what she is in real life.(let me also put in a plug for the dvd of a movie that also stars Alexis Bledel \\"Tuck Everlasting\\":) And the actress that plays Her Mother is also very talented and very beautiful.And they work together magnificatly.A very rare thing in tv today.I been waiting for this and this set is longggg overdue.This show is \\"a little show that could\\".Started out as this little show and became a loved part of our lives in America.God Bless America and God bless the Gilmore GirlS.And exspect to see lots more of Alexis Bledel.I also want to note that Alexis's eyes speaks silent poetry for her eyes can speak without a sound.A Treasure of this gifted actress.Everyone here is top knoch and more then worth our viewing.Highly recommended.Check out this show and exsperiance the rare Magic that tv needs much more of...Long Live The Gilmore GirlS......
0385504209|5.0|This book was phenomenal. Period. End of Story. I have recommended it to every person I know and they've all loved it, except 2 people. The only 2 friends I know who did not like this book, are both religious bible-beaters born and raised in the South. They can't get it through their heads that the church isn't perfect and there are actually other theories and relgions out there. So, if you can open up your mind and put your religious beliefs aside for one second, then you'll love this book. I think the movie is coming out in 2005.
0446310786|5.0|I first read this book for school, at age 13. Every so often I pick it up and re-read it. I must've read it at least 6 times by now. This book, I feel, is the best piece of literature ever written. It brings out every human emotion. There are some funny moments and some very sad moments. Harper Lee writes the characters so well, it's like you know them. In every neighborhood, you have the mean old lady whose house you hate to walk by (Mrs. Dubose) and the character no-one really knows, they never leave their home and speculation arises as to their activities (Boo Radley). I'd have to say my favorite character is Atticus. He does his best raising his two children after his wife dies at a young age. He tells his kids the truth and doesn't sugar coat things for them. He talked to them like they were his equal, not below him as many parents do. He teaches his children that just because every one else says or does something that doesn't mean that it is ok. The best part is his closing argument at Tom Robinson's trial. Atticus was a kind and patient man. No matter the color of your skin or your social status, he treated everyone with love and respect.

THIS HAS GOT TO BE ONE OF THE BEST 5 ROCK ALBUMS EVER MADE! UNFORTUNATELY, THIS IS THE LAST AC/DC CD THAT WOULD FEATURE BON SCOTT AS THE LEAD SINGER. BON DIED IN 1980.
B0000DJZA5|1.0|&gt;Don't believe the hype......from either side.<br />Guess what? The &quot;other side&quot; isn't after your money.<br />&gt;Think for yourself, as the Beatles would say.<br />Or rather, as two of the Beatles actually did say: the DEAD two.<br />&gt;The best thing about this reissue, however, is the inclusion of John's glorious &quot;Don't Let Me Down&quot; at the expense of the totally superfluous &quot;Dig It&quot; and &quot;Maggie Mae&quot;. <br />Look up &quot;superfluous&quot; in a dictionary. &quot;Don't Let Me Down&quot; has been continuously available on a Beatles album since BEFORE the original Let It Be was ever released. (How many times do we have to say this before it finally sinks in?) &quot;Dig It&quot; and &quot;Maggie Mae&quot;, on the other hand, are ONLY available on the original Let It Be.

B00006JKOL|2.0|Hmmm....I'd say that if you love &quot;This Was&quot;, &quot;Stand Up&quot;, &quot;Benefit&quot;, &quot;Aqualung&quot;, Think as a Brick&quot;, &quot;Living in the Past&quot;, and &quot;A Passion Play&quot; AND you're desperate for more Tull from this approximate era AND you can keep your expectations very low you might consider this. How do I account for most of the other reviews? There are persons about-not many, but enough-for whom you could tear off a slip of paper and write the words &quot;Jethro Tull&quot; on it and receive $16 in return. Remember this in case you're ever hard up for cash.<br />I could complain about tortured syntax, dangling participles, chains of sentence fragments, hyphen abuse, and so on, but there's little point: the lyrics on this recording are pretty much gibberish (except for those of &quot;Summerday Sands&quot; and &quot;March the Mad Scientist&quot;, both of which are &quot;bonus tracks&quot; and for those of &quot;Grace&quot;, which lasts about five seconds). There is scarcely a sign our lyricist wants to communicate anything at all to his listener. Most of the lyrics here are utterly opaque.<br />I haven't mentioned music yet, but never fear; I'll be back.
B000089RVR|5.0|&quot;Life for Rent,&quot; Dido's second album, contains great songs full of lost love, guilt, and hope, all sung by one of the most haunting, delicate and deceptively plain voices in pop music today.  (No flourishes or over-singing on this album!)  Dido's talents are not limited to singing, either writing or co-writing all the songs on the album.  The music ranges from pop songs, including &quot;Life for Rent&quot; and &quot;Stoned,&quot; to an almost R&amp;B/funk feel on &quot;Who Makes You Feel&quot; and even a danceable &quot;Sand in My Shoes.&quot;  There's even a hidden track that fits well with the rest of the album.  Standout songs:  &quot;White Flag,&quot; &quot;Don't Leave Home,&quot;  &quot;Life for Rent,&quot; and &quot;See the Sun.&quot;
B00005JMTN|4.0|I really was not expecting this type of film from Tim Burton. Not to say it did not have Tim Burton written all over it, it did. Usually his films are so much in the fantasy realm with no peep of reality to them. This time, he did have a real situation combined with the very heavily laden fantastic unreal stories of a man who ultimatly is the BIG FISH.<- of course not really, but one will understand once they have seen the movie.<br />This definatly is a good date movie and one that should not be missed. I found it refreshing and very sweet.
B0000025C0|5.0|Very similar in sound to their debut album, but the mood is a little more mellow. The production with the multi layered guitars, great vocals and vocal harmonies and excellent drumming are all still there as in the first record, but with a track like the brilliant ballad &quot;A Man I'll Never Be&quot; there is something that did not appear on the almost non stop rocking first album.<br />This album should be considered essential for those fans of classic '70's rock. The title track is one of the all time great rock tunes, with a lead run that just makes the hair on the back of my neck stand on end. Other stand out tracks are &quot;Feelin'Satisfied&quot; and &quot;Don't Be Afraid&quot;.
0385720920|4.0|This was the first Chuck Palahniuk book that I've read, and I loved it. I would give it 4 and a half if I could. The description of the hospital and the people in it was amazing. My only problem with the book was that things were introduced and not explained until later in the book, and it caused a little confusion. But then again, sometimes when that happened, it enhanced the story. Pick this one up, as long as sexual situations and cursing don't bother you.
B000002KD5|5.0|The first of the then-new lineup of Mick Fleetwood, John McVie, Christine McVie, Lindsey Buckingham, and Stevie Nicks, Fleetwood Mac's &quot;debut&quot; is an incredible one.  There is not a song I do NOT like on this album...  The album boasts Buckingham's &quot;Monday Morning&quot; and &quot;I'm So Afraid&quot;, McVie's &quot;Over My Head&quot; and &quot;Say You Love Me&quot;, as well as Nicks's &quot;Landslide&quot; and &quot;Rhiannon&quot;.  <BR>Let's take a look at it:<br />&quot;Monday Morning&quot;<BR>Such a great Lindsey Buckingham song.  The guitar riff always gets stuck in my head.  Fun to sing along to; opens a lot of early shows with this song.  An introduction to the future rock-pop conversion of a Bristish blues band.<br />&quot;Warm Ways&quot;<BR>Classic Christine McVie.  This is, of course, back when everyone was still getting along and Christine and John were (relatively) happy as were Stevie and Lindsey.  Probably about John, this song's soft piano and poetic lyrics about &quot;forever love&quot; is beautiful.<br />&quot;Blue Letter&quot;<br />Okay, so they didn't write this one, but I truly love it.  It's incredibly fun to sing along to, especially while driving on a deserted road or the highway with your windows rolled down, the sound all the way up, not caring how you sound.  Just so much fun!<br />&quot;Rhiannon&quot;<BR>Even if you're not a Fleetwood Mac fan, you have probably heard this song.  The beautiful, haunting debut of Stevie Nicks as a member of Fleetwood Mac.  It was, originally, slated to be on the second Buckingham Nicks record, along with &quot;Monday Morning&quot; and &quot;Landslide&quot; but alas, that second album was never made and worked better here anyway (I'm sure...like &quot;Crystal&quot;).  Beautiful song, certainly one of my favorites.<br />&quot;Over My Head&quot;<BR>Still played in 1997 during The Dance reunion tour, this Christine song is fun to listen to and to sing along with.  A major hit for the band and one ofthe three songs released as singles from this album (&quot;Rhiannon&quot; and &quot;Say You Love Me&quot; were also released as singles).<br />&quot;Crystal&quot;<BR>A Buckingham Nicks song redone with better production and, obviously, more instruments.  The best version of this song released, in my opinion, as of yet.  Nicks sung main vocals in 1998 on the &quot;Practical Magic&quot; soundtrack (she did write it, to dispell rumours that it is a Buckingham song) and Buckingham originally sang it on the BN record.  However, neither come close to this version.  Absolutely beautiful.<br />&quot;Say You Love Me&quot;<BR>Another hit for Christine McVie.  There's not all that much to say.  A great, fun song!<br />&quot;Landslide&quot;<BR>Most people have heard the 1997 Dance version of this song (&quot;This is for you, Daddy...&quot;) but have not heard the original album version.  Here it is!  It's a little faster paced and I, personally, like it a little more (though one of my favorite versions is on FM-Live, 1980...Stevie's losing her voice, but it's still great).  Great song!  Definitely should be heard if you're only familiar with the 1997 version which pales, in some way, in comparison.<br />&quot;World Turning&quot;<BR>A Buckingham-McVie rewrite of Peter Green's (check out the old albums, The Original Fleetwood Mac, Pious Bird of Good Omen, Mr. Wonderful, English Rose, etc for this guitar god's contribution to the then-british blues band's albums) &quot;World Keeps Turning&quot;.  Great!  I love this song!  Fleetwood gets a drum solo in the middle which is awesome in its self.  <br />&quot;Sugar Daddy&quot;<BR>I don't really understand the appeal of this song, though I know I love it.  A great McVie song.  Never a hit and I hadn't even heared of it until I bought this album.  It's fun, though.  I enjoy it a lot!<br />&quot;I'm So Afraid&quot;<BR>Buckingham closes the album with this masterpiece.  This very dark song holds an incredible guitar solo.  A must hear!  Buckingham at some of his finest rock! <br />This album is definitely worth the investment.  It's supposed to be remastered and re-released March 24 (?), 2004.  I would wait, if you have yet to buy it, and get it then since the remastered songs should be even better.  A great album, a great debut for the future Rock and Roll Hall of Fame-rs.
0451169514|5.0|This book is the best book that I've ever read, and I've read a lot of books. Not only is it terrifying, but it also deals with growing up, race, and most of all, friendship. The friendship between the characters in this book is both beatiful and moving. This is King's masterpiece. If you like horror, if you like reading in general, go out and get this right now.
B0000DD7LC|5.0|Now this cd makes sense. It is soooo soulful. Better than her first. Despite the haters, her singing is much better and the music is great (most of it reminds me of growing up in the 70's).
B000002B5L|5.0|I first got this CD in 5th grade, and I loved it, but I lost track of it over the years. It was only about a year ago that a friend of mine burned it for me, and I remembered why I loved it so much when I was younger. Now that I'm older, I can appreciate the lyrics more, and the beats as well. This is a hip-hop classic.
B000024D4R|5.0|This was my 4th pink floyd album(Ive only been into pink floyd for 2 years) and it has a way of making 17 min song not put you to sleep. i consider pigs on the wing just fillers to start and to end and the dont follow the rest of the album except when they mention being dragged down by a stone like they did in dogs. the other 3 are so different, i wouldn't know they were on the same album if it weren't for the names...and the fact that with little effort, i could tell that well...they were! But Sheep tied for my one of my favorites with have a cigar,money, and run like hell. That inflateble pig made it have the best album cover. dogs has great guitar throughout the entire song( how does gilmore do it) and pigs has very intersting lyrics and also awsome guitar. But none compare to sheep!(think about that last sentence.) I love that erie kind of key bord in the begining and the electric guitar throughout the song therefor sheep is(are) the best<br />PS: Time is the best song ever written and is the reason dark side is the best album!!!!!!! <br />&quot;Ticking away the miments that mak up a dull day&quot;<BR>&quot;You fritter and waste the hours in an offhand way&quot; <BR>(Trails off into the distance)
B0000VAFO0|2.0|I knew before even going into this movie that it would not be &quot;pure&quot; vampire type film. Still, to be disappointed on top of that was a big letdown. I love monsters. I love vampires. I love werewolves. I would have accepted this movie a bit more if they had left out the references to these classic fiends and created a whole different type of demonic bad guy that *should* use guns.<br />Insistance on using these two familiar and well loved creatures of the night was nothing more than a hook to draw in an audience; beyond that the people/creatures had no resemblnce whatsoever to the two legendary monsters. The mere idea of these supposedly vicious and blood/flesh hungry beasties running around shooting special guns at each other for no other reason than &quot;we are at war&quot; is as ludicrous as a starving man shooting a cow and not eating it.<br />Okay, the premise? Vampires and werewolves are at war, and we don't find out why until the end, which is nonclimatic and doesn't make any sense. There is one person on the earth that contains blood that the werewolves want, the vampires see the lycans chasing the human so they chase him down too. Yawn. That's it.<br />What I didn't like about the movie? Other than what I mentioned above, the plot was so thin you could read a newspaper through it. The script was horrible, and while the premise of a battle between vampires and werewolves would be very cool, you need to include some TEETH! It was as if the scriptwriters could not make up their minds whether to make anaction-shoot-em-up movie or a horror movie, and wound out with less than the sum of both.<br />In particular is a scene when Selena (Kate Beckinsale) drives her car into the water with Michael (Scott Speedman). He &quot;rescues&quot; her after she hits her head on the windshield and gets knocked out, pulls her from thewater, gives her CPR, after which she coughs out a little water and comes to. HELLO! Vampires are dead. They are not alive. They don't breathe. They don't have heartbeats. They can't be knocked out, and they can't drown. And after all this, Selena tells Kraven &quot;He saved my life.&quot; Riiiiiiiight. What life? You're undead!<br />Another problem with the vampires was that they seem to have forgotten they can change into bats and fly away. Instead, they just stand there and let the werewolves chew them.With the werewolves, only Michael changes with the full moon (of course) but the other werewolves are changing back and forth like a malfunctioning traffic light. The special effects were mediocre; the turning of the werewolves was really no better han &quot;American Werewolf In London&quot;, and all the fighting was so &quot;A-La-Matrix&quot; that for a moment I was confused as to which movie I was really watching.<br />Okay, so what DID I like about the movie? The acting was actually verye good. Kate Beckinsale, Scott Speedman, Michael Sheen, Shane Brolly, and especially Bill Nighy played their roles very well. The acting alone is the only reason I gave this movie 2 stars instead of 1. It is a visually stylish movie as far as dress and scenery. I liked the idea of vampires and werewolves descending from one anscestor. I thought that Viktor's tomb was very cool, and the visual effects of the awakening of Viktor were pretty slick. I am glad that I rented before buying on this one. It just got scratched off my purchase list. After viewing it, I just wanted to run out and bite someone in order to fill the hunger left unsated.reathe. They don't have heartbeats. They can't be knocked out, and they can't drown.

0736657134|5.0|I have listened to all of the tales of Jack Aubrey and company. However, I have never read them. They are a difficult read but a delight to listen to on tape or CD. My favorites are the unabridged books read by Patrick Tull. They take about 15 hours each and are perfect for listening to on a commute of 1/2 hour or more. I used to dread the drive, now I look forward to it. If you tried reading one and got lost or confused, try listening to one instead. Also, make sure you start with Master and Commander, the first volume. It lays the foundation for the other 12 volumes.
B00007GZQZ|4.0|One of my favorite movies. Very funny. I just bought it on DVD and was surprised to find one of the scenes &quot;falling trees&quot; was cut out! I expected it would be the same version I had seen many times before.
B00004YW6I|5.0|I've heard many speak of how this album is the &quot;taming down&quot; of the enigmatic Ms. Harvey and while it may turn away some of her fans who prefer her &quot;Dry&quot; days, I believe it has made me a more appreciative one.<BR>After spending months living in New York City, Harvey wrote the songs which would be greatly influenced by the neighborhoods and landmarks of NYC and one can almost feel as if you are gazing upon the Empire State Building with that one person while listening to &quot;You Said Something.&quot;  <BR>This album, in my view, is one of, if not the best album by Harvey.  Her lyrics still have a quality to them that I believe one doesn't find much anymore with singer/songwriters.<BR>The highlights for me with this album are: &quot;A Place Called Home,&quot; &quot;This Mess We're In,&quot; &quot;We Float,&quot; and &quot;This Is Love.&quot;  One of my absolute favorites on this album, and probably one of the best openers for an album ever is &quot;Big Exit.&quot;  The chorus is what does it for me to state it bluntly.  <BR>It is one of the best albums in my personal collection and while I yearn for some new material by Ms. Harvey, this album still holds the power for me that it did when I first listened to it all those years ago.
B0000CFW87|5.0|Josh has once again managed to mesmerize me with his beautiful, powerful voice.  Every song on this album is simply wonderful.  When I first heard \\"You Raise Me Up\\" I got goose bumps, and immediately went out and bought the CD.  Then I heard \\"Remember When It Rained\\".   I honestly went to a place that was so peaceful and beautiful.  I was that captivated.  What a beatiful song, what a powerful voice.  A true talent.<br />This CD surpasses the first.  Great job Josh.  Great job.
B000002HPV|5.0|Clearly &quot;Homogenic&quot; has got to be Bjork's greatest album to date. With the electronic beats it makes Bjork a really unique artist in music. Hunter, All Neon Like, Joga, Bachelorette, Immature, All Is Full Of Love, Unravel, Alarm Call, they are all amazing tracks to the album but those are my favorite. Bjork's voice is trully one in a million. Her voice on these tracks make it worth buying the album. This is a very great album for any Bjork fan. To all the new Bjork fans out there, &quot;Homogenic&quot; would be a good first choice to get.
B00006RU5B|5.0|&quot;Audioslave&quot; is an important album because it clearly marks the new type of supergroup for the new millennium and it brings back a classic flavor to modern hard rock that is so lacking in today's new bands. This is a group composed of the unison between talents from two of the best rock bands of the 90's, if the pairing of the members of Rage Against The Machine with Soundgarden vocalist Chris Cornell seemed doubtful, then those doubts can be cast away by an album of startling sonic strength. It is a brilliant mix because what we get here is the almost funk sound of rap metal married with Cornell's Robert Plant-like vocal flights and surreal lyrics. While bands like Staind, Godsmack and Disturbed simply try to make a trend out of moodiness and repetitive chords, Audioslave resurrect the sheer energy and force of all-out hard rock so expressed by legenday groups like Led Zeppelin and Black Sabbath. &quot;Cochise&quot; is a thundering opening, a crunching assault of momentum and vibrant metal colors. &quot;Gasoline&quot; is one of the best cuts here, it has a driving hook and almost evocative feel. &quot;Set It Off&quot; is also in the visceral riffing tradition, it almost sounds like Cornell singing an anthem. And yet the band can still provide moments of wonderful melody and depth as in &quot;Like A Stone,&quot; a hard rock ballad with atmosphere and a memorable solo by Tom Morello. &quot;Audioslave&quot; is also an album that vibrates with skillfull experimentation. Consider the psychedelic solo from &quot;Shadow On The Sun&quot; that sounds like something out of The Beatles' &quot;Tomorrow Never Knows.&quot; &quot;Bring Em Back Alive&quot; is a surreal journey with Cornell crooning Jim Morrison-like visions. Audioslave proves that even today a classic sound can still be produced, that bands can still make rock that will survive the test of time and reach beyond trends. The recent news that the ex members of Guns N' Roses will partner-up with Stone TemplePilots frontman Scott Weiland is even more testimony that Audioslave also proves that the supergroup is not dead and can indeed rock and roll even more than the newer kids on the block.
B00005NWM3|2.0|I've owned this cd for a while now, and I haven't listened to it in at least a year.  I liked it the first few months I owned it, but I look back and I realized that the whole second half of the album is at best average and forgettable.  I still like the first 4 tracks, 3 of which were turned into radio singles.  I like the Long Road a lot more right now...I recommend it over this cd if you want more variety.  But to each his own.
B0000DJZA5|5.0|I am so glad that they decided to rerelease this album without the &quot;Spector-ism's.&quot;  In my opinion, Phil Spector's additions to the songs were just bad production ideas.  The tracks sounded great as they were without all the chorus, the orchestration, and the insane amounts of reverb.  I'm glad that this the powers that be decided to give us the real, &quot;despectorized&quot; version of this album.
B0000B3FCX|4.0|Very good cd, much better than Silver Side Up.  Good variety of rock music styles are shown on this cd.  Although there's a lot of structure similarity, which is sometimes very obvious so I dropped it from 5 stars to 4, I still find myself very entertained by this cd.  Rock on, Nickelback, don't listen to people who don't even like your genre anyway and feel the need to write reviews on cds they would never purchase anyway.
B000002HJD|1.0|Look, I'm a huge Doors fan, I had all their stuff on vinyl in college.  I bought this in 1978 and listened to it.  Once.  I listened to it again the other day to see if perhaps I missed something.  Nope.  Spend your money on something else.
B00005JME0|4.0|I was lucky enough to view this movie at the Sundance Film Festival where several people screamed out loud at the first scary scene.  The film is filled with intense moments, and some that are quite shocking.  Overall it was an enjoyable and thought provoking movie that makes you realize that changing the past is not what it's cracked up to be.
6305971099|1.0|Halloween was scary, stylish and suspensful. Halloween 5 isn't scary nor suspensful. This is the worst Halloween movie yet besides Halloween 3 which was just stupid. Halloween movies were really scary but this one is just cheesy and annoying. The Halloween series which was once scary, now has to please a new generation who thinks gore is scary. Do not waste your money on buying this piece of crap.
B000002IOW|4.0|The musicianship on Presto is as good as any Rush album you will find.  Not outstanding from start to finish, but it's worth the price just to get The Pass, Scars, and Presto.  There is essential Rush material on Presto that should not be missed.
0156027321|5.0|A young Indian boy discovers religion, and is so taken with the idea of faith that he commits to Catholocism, Hinduism, and Islam. Then, in its voyage across the Pacific to Canada, the ship carrying the boy and his family, as well as a menagerie of zoo animals (his father is a zookeeper), sinks, leaving the boy alone in a lifeboat with a tiger, an orangutan, a hurt zebra, and a nasty hyena.  The respective struggles for survival ensue, making up the majority of this fascinating, fast read.  How do these two seemingly disparate parts of the novel connect?  The answer is subtlely.  Yann Martel is a quirky writer, and he's written a quirky book.  It might be easy to finish this novel and think its various parts don't necessarily mesh, but I have a feeling that even if you felt that way, you'd enjoy it anyway, because the parts in and of themselves are so interesting.  But actually, what the young boy Pi learns about religious faith has a great deal of bearing (and also is greatly influenced by) what happens to him during his ordeal.<br />This novel always keeps its sense of humour, but be prepared for some harsh brutality.  After all, the struggle for survival is never pretty, and the natural world, while offering many beauties, can be incredibly violent as well.  During his journey, Pi learns that faith in general is much more important than faith in its specifics, and whether or not you're Hindu, Catholic, or Muslim matters little when you're simply trying to figure out how to capture enough water to prevent yourself from dying before the day ends.  &quot;Life of Pi&quot; manages to be both thoroughly entertaining and thoughtfully profound, but never in a self-conciously literary way.  Martel's writing style is loose and easy, and the pages fly by.<br />I was greatly touched by the novel's ending, and it introduces a startling ambiguity that will immediately make you want to read the book again, accepting perhaps a completely different interpretation of events.<br />I'm not exaggerating when I say this book is quite unlike anything I've read before.  It manages to be truly original and heartfelt, containing an important message for our troubled, hate-filled times.
B000089RVX|4.0|This wasn't the first album I bought due to hype, and surely it won't be the last. Some of those hyped albums do rule, and some other are a major disappointment. So in which of these categories does Evanescence's &quot;Fallen&quot; fits? In the middle of those.<BR>Everytime I listened to Evanescence's &quot;Going Under&quot; or &quot;Bring Me To Life&quot; in the radio or in MTV, I thought &quot;Well, this band really rules!&quot;, and I was almost decided to buy their album. But then I listened to &quot;My Immortal&quot;, and then I was sure I'd buy that album, because that song ruled so, so much.<BR>But unfortunately those songs were it. Except for these three songs, every song in this album is a little boring, a little depressive (well, nearly every song in this album talks about love somehow, and lyrics are fine). So if you think three awesome songs are worth your money for this album, then it's a great CD. But if you don't think this way, then you should try to listen to other tracks in this album to see if you like them.<BR>Evanescence's catchy chorus, between guitars and pianos, only work in those three songs, in my opinion. I'd much rather give this album 3.5 stars, but Amazon doesn't allow such a thing, so I give it four stars, because I do believe these guys have future and they deserve their sucess for those singles they've released.
B00005JKGV|1.0|All of David Lynchs film are stupid and this one is one of the worst followed only by the the mind numbilgly bad Muhholand drive. The only people that will these movies are psudeo intelcutals who think it is cool to say they like them. I am not stupid by the way two of my favorite films are Memento and Swimming pool, get those instead.
B00005V3Z4|5.0|Whether you think Donnie is Schizophrenic or psychic, this movie scores on several levels (and I'm a babyboomer.)  It rings true about adolescence, adulthood, disillusionment, hope, innocence and spirituality...all with a rather strange plot that keeps you entertained until the very end.  Even the music haunts you after the movie is over.  I am like a lot of others who don't know exactly why this movie works for me, but try it...it might just work for you too.
B000005RQF|5.0|Michael Stipe referred to this album in Mojo magazine as being the most like REM that REM has ever sounded. And I'm inclined to agree.<br />For fans like myself this is the ultimate REM experience. For newcomers, an excellent introduction. For those sitting on the fence, it'll knock you clean to the ground on the REM side.<br />On previous albums, Stipe's vocals remain firmly buried in the mix, the lyrics practically indecipherable in places. This album shows Stipe's astounding vocal ability off to it's best. Heart-felt, passionate, full of emotion. The lyrics are often cryptic and abstract, yet somehow relevant ; as we've come to expect.<br />The instrumentation is virtually perfect, and not rooted in the 80's which means that the album hasn't aged at all, it's timeless and classic. This could be REM of the 80's, of the 90's, of the 21st century. Layers of delicate sound, blended to make the rich, soul-inspiring melodies which can lift us up or send us down effortlessly.<br />Stand out tracks include the beautifully simple &quot;What if We Give it Away?&quot;, and the heavier yet controlled &quot;Begin the Begin&quot;. The folk-esque &quot;Swan Swan H&quot; sticks in your mind with it's melodic guitar and lilting phrasing, and &quot;Superman&quot; is worth listening to for the harmonies alone. Tremendous.<br />The pivotal importance of this album in the career of the biggest band in the world today cannot be overplayed. This is the very essence of REM. Berry, Buck, Mills and Stipe all at their creative best. Essential.
B00005QG9J|4.0|I love when a band evolves, and experiments!!! Incubus could have easily gone the more poppy route but don't.I'm looking forward to their future. If you love incubus, you'll probably really enjoy bands like A Perfect Circle,Year of the Rabbit, Coheed and Cambria, and Shoz-Bot You'd be surprised how much great stuff is out there that you'll never hear on the radio, or mtv
B00005JMFI|5.0|I believe that this movie is an excellent movie.  It is for the people that don't have to hear a curse word to laugh.  This movie is hilarious, and the whole family can watch it just as our family did.  To sum all of this up, if you can laugh at a joke without curse words, and let the kid in you out then you will love this movie.
B00005JMCT|3.0|I loved American Pie. I loved the sequel. American Wedding, however shows a downward movement of this widely successful tale of high school friends endlessly in search of gratification. Do not get me wrong, I enjoyed this film, but not nearly as much as I enjoyed the two previous installments. The acting in this film was of similar nature to its predecessors, and the jokes were in the same vein. Overall, however, I feel that this film did not live up to the legacy created by the original. Despite a few good laughs, and some gratuitous nudity, this film was not at all what I expected it to be. I give this film 3 stars.
0684853523|5.0|The best thing I can say about Stephen King is this: in his best books, he writes like a guy you've known all your life, who flops back in your lazy boy with a drink as he tells his story. He speaks directly, and plain, and it's clear he means what he says. J.K. Rowling does the same, but secretively, and whispery. ON WRITING suggests that Stephen's run-in with a van has not ended his ability to write well. This book was finished after the accident. It has conviction, and I loved it. (While I personally consider his next novel, Dreamcatcher, one of his weaker books, it also had fine moments.) In ON WRITING, the first part tells us some of his isolated memories, which he believes have helped him become a writer. He avoids calling it a biography. Some interesting points discussed are Stephen's term as a newsletter writer (as a boy); his period as a manual laborer; teaching, and selling CARRIE. In the second part he gives advise to writers. He approaches this like a regular guy. For example, he compares his writer's rules to a \\"toolbox\\" that you should keep with you. Otherwise you'll get frustrated and give up on your project. I find it interesting that Stephen finds characters \\"more important\\" than plot. Some writers I've read and spoken with say that characters ARE plot. It shows how a writer develops their own methods, and that they'll use whatever works for them.
B0000VD04M|4.0|A special collector's edition of Ed Wood? The time could not be better. In fact, this film should have been released in this format years ago. This film is the incredible and entertaining tale of the worst director of all time, which is what makes his work so fantastic. With an all star cast, great writing, and superb directing, this film is sure to both engage and inform film fans. I give this film 4 stars.
B0000A118M|5.0|5 stars for the music. Coltrane at his best. A classic album. My only complaint is that it is too short. For the Coltrane colt I recommend &quot;My Favorite Things&quot;, &quot;Giant Steps&quot;, or &quot;The Ultimate Blue Train&quot;.
B00005JMCN|5.0|Who couldn't love a story about the underdog emerging on top? Seabiscuit is a delightful tale sure to warm every heart (I can't believe I just said that!) Both beautiful and inspirational ,this well crafted tale of a downtrodden jockey and a worthless (So you think!) horse, is sure to engage anyone. A finely written story, exceptional acting, and superb cinematography prove that this film is a major contender for the Hall of Fame. I give this film 5 out of 5 stars and recommend it to everyone.
B000003S5H|5.0|If you want to buy an album to begin a trip hop collection, begin with this. I'd say this is already a classic among the style and a proven one too. And of course, if you want to be chique, styly, modern, etc. this a good way to go. Get a scarf, small, square glasses, a pair of cool sneakers, mix them up with this cd and you'll be in fashion my friend. Even my mother liked this CD which is great for a person who listens opera and corny latin american music. The only thing that I don't like about it is knowing that this was a moment of inspiration for these guys: the rest of their albums are more like the rest of electronic music albums out there, they are just not worth the 15 bucks you have to pay for them.
B00003CXIP|5.0|What does it seem to be?  A slice of sentimentalism from the mid 80s spiced with adventurism and bawdy humor, a look back at an idyllic summer in the 1950s.  It IS these things, but it's much more.  It's the gold standard for the coming-of-age film and one of the most important movies ever made.<br />Our lives are marked by climaxes including birth, puberty, marriage, and death.  These are romanticized, surrounded by ritual and sacrament because they're too real to see in the raw--as soiling by blood or sperm, as radical irrevocable change.  Pubertal transformation is particularly subject to lush romanticizing.  Puberty is a time of confusion, the intrusion of sex, identity in flux.  For boys, there's the added challenge of achieving manhood, a protean slippery status which is forever in question.<br />And so, for this question, there is the quest.  Four boys walk railroad tracks in rural Oregon hoping for a glimpse of another boy their age who's been killed by a train. On the way, they tell gross-out stories, muse about the pop culture of the 50s (Mighty Mouse, Pez, Paladin), argue, fight, and make up.  <br />Pubertal boys create a treehouse culture, a separate world from the world of females and the world of adults.  It's full of boasts, smokes, and card games.  It's marked by looking for ways to test themselves in the big bad world.  So when Vern Tessio calls the quartet to adventure with the macabre question \\"You guys wanna see a dead body?\\" his peers are game.<br />\\"Stand by Me\\" moves a couple degrees from innocence to experience.  The idyllic 1950s move into the turbulent 60s.  The sweet-tempered 12-year-old becomes the surly adolescent.  Languorous summer tenses into autumn, smoky and chilled.  But not just yet! Mirages curdle as literate Gordie, leaderly Chris, and two lesser friends hum 50s classics and walk the tracks toward junior high and their inevitable separation.  This is the last golden summer before the fall.  <br />This is a movie of sunlight andleaves, of 12-year-old buddies and their nonchalant homoeroticism, of teary heart-to-hearts they will never have again as men, of incipient heterosexual awakening spurred by Annette Funicello's ..., of meeting Death (his sockets full of flies), of making jokes (the bawdier the better), of leaving town for the woods, of dangers from junkyard dogs, angry fathers, delinquent gangs, and leeches.  <br />This is the greatest gay film of all time, not \\"Philadelphia\\" or \\"Parting Glances\\" or \\"Burnt Money.\\"  The tenderness between Gordie and Chris is so natural, so easy, because it occurs in a world not yet policed by the taboos of adult society and not yet hardened by requirements for macho display.

B00009V7T2|3.0|Wow, this is one not for the masses, but for the guy who likes the wierd prog rock. Definately loud and fast, but also many breaks for ambient noises and strange sounds, I mean that in the best way possible. From the get go, this Cd establishes a sense of wondering, &quot;Now I'm Lost&quot;. While Cedric Zavala's incredible voice soars up and down. This alblum is good and its cheap. If something is good and cheap, you should check it out.
B00005JKGO|5.0|WHERE IS THE DVD of 'La Dolce Vita'??  This is far superior art and entertainment to that wonderful-but-ridiculous '8 1/2'  I mean, we all love Fellini, but why is his most coherent and artistically mature film lying around in some distributor's vault while trash like 'Shanghai Surprise' and box-sets of Whoopi Goldberg movies get all these million-copy releases??  Fellini is more than '8 1/2'; FEEL FREE TO RELEASE THIS DVD ANYTIME!!  Ugh, do I have to get a region-free DVD player to watch foreign films?  Heck, there are some American classic films that do not have release here, but are being printed in UK and European codes.  What is wrong with American distributors??  We want our Fellini, and we want it now!!  Gimme the sweet life gimme the sweet life GIMME THE SWEET LIFE!!!!<br />P.S.  To all sympathizers, Bergman's 'Persona' is FINALLY getting American release in February.  Cross your fingers they don't back out at the last minute in favor of a straight-to-DVD sequel to 'Finding Nemo':  'Filet of Nemo:  Almond Crusted with a Side of Rice Pilaf,' starring the voices of Keanu Reeves, Jennifer Aniston, and Dom Deluise.

B00008H2LB|5.0|People are shocked when I tell them I listen to Linkin Park.  It's creative.  Especially in Nobody's Listening, they find a way to take the most incoherent sounds and work them into an entire album that flows not just in the songs themselves, but in the whole.  There is a lot of creativity in the lyrics as well, making this a high standard to judge against.  <br />P.S.- I hate flamers who feel the need to degrade things just because they don't like them.
0385504209|3.0|As a mystery novel, The DaVinci Code is less than thrilling. If you can't figure out the bad guy, his motivation, and break the codes yourself long before the hero does, then you probably haven't read too many mysteries.<br />The hero, Robert Langdon, is every bit as blah and undistinguished as his name, and the heroine, Sophie Neveu, is equally colorless. I did find it a hoot, though, that Sophie actually happened to be the code-breaking estranged granddaughter of the book's first murder victim, around whom the plot centers.  I mean...how conveeeeeeeeeeenient for popular scholar Langdon; she can figure out what he can't, and vice versa! (What are the odds?) They are reminiscent of undeveloped pulp fiction characters who exist only to move the plot along. Like short-lived moths they flutter around doing their mercifully brief thing in this book.<br />So don't read this book expecting to find the mystery-solver(s) as much a part of the entertainment as they mystery itself. They are not even as interesting as the Hardy Boys and Nancy Drew.<br />Now on to the controversial plot...well, if you're an devotee of alternative history books, you should find this just as indigestible as readers to whom this is new. You'll also be hooting at the supposedly inside joke of the murdered Louvre curator being named Sauniere; others won't get it. Hey, did you know Walt Disney was a pagan feminist whose life work is coded with goddess references? Me either.<br />Dan Brown makes use of much research that has gone before him: if I were one of the authors whose work he uses without credit (he mentions HOLY BLOOD, HOLY GRAIL and a few other titles, but doesn't even give the authors' names) for his own plot, I'd be extremely ticked off. This is a novel that needs a bibliography.<br />&quot;History is written by the winners,&quot; another unattributed quote from the DaVinci Code. I would say that history is also written by pop bestsellers.
6304711905|5.0|As with any movie involving the legend of the OK Corral, this is not history.  Script writers were limited only by their prolific imaginations.<br />Kurt Russell plays a believable Wyatt Earp, Sam Elliot a phenomenal Virgil Earp, Powers Boothe a perfect Curly Bill, and Val Kilmer a bazaar Doc Holliday.  Kilmer's entertaining interpretation of the role is unlike any done before.<br />This movie has a radical change in character at the mid-point.  The first half consists of introductions and character development.  There is plenty of action to carry the story forward, plenty of the tension of anticipating the next act of violence.  The focus is on the Earps and their friends and love interests, the Clantons and their allies, and the dynamics of Tombstone.  The second half is unbridled action, with no effort to tell a story.  There is little story left to tell, but the action sustains the adrenalin flow, keeping the viewer absorbed while waiting for the final details to unfold.<br />Though the violence is more graphic then the westerns of the John Wayne era, gore doesn't become a co-star.  One of the best westerns of the last three decades.
B0000DZEA1|5.0|The album is fantastic in its own right (as over 100 people have already mentioned).  The themes are beautiful, easy to remember, and used well.  However, that's been true of the previous two soundtracks.  What I think is really wonderful about this album in particular is the way that Howard Shore uses themes from the earlier films.  He takes time to develop them, use them as fragments, juxtapose them with other ideas.  The wildly creative extent to which he takes these themes wouldn't be possible if he were scoring just one film (you need the whole movie just to get to a point where you recognize everything!).  Here, he takes advantage of the fact that he's working with material that will be familiar to the audience, and is very clever and creative.  I've never heard anything like it.  I think Shore took advantage of a unique opportunity and did great things with it.<br />Also, off the top of my head, I can't remember if Shore did the orchestration himself or not (many film composers don't), but I'd like to especially mention the fantastic orchestration.  There are some wonderful moments in this soundtrack, like the opening of &quot;Minas Tirith&quot; (the horn solo playing the theme of Gondor over really eerie, dissonant, strings) and &quot;Minas Morgul&quot; (really, really strung-out woodwinds getting this incredible effect that recalls the Witches' Sabbath from Berlioz's &quot;Symphonie Fantastique&quot;).  So crunchy and nasty and perfectly cool.
0553296981|4.0|This book tells a great deal of feelings that help you relate back to that time to know what it was like to live then.  Anne had strenghth to be able to have lived in the Secret Annexe with out your own room or anywhere to just get away from it all, but as you read you learn about the other side of Anne that is always hidden and know she hides her feelings by laughter.  Anne learns to love, not be selfish, and hide feelings at a young age.  I don't think anyone should have to do such a thing, but it all comes back to Hitler who was in the wrong proscuting all the Jews for no absolute reason.  All in all I think this book tells you a little about Anne and how it was to be scared to be killed if found.
B000089RVX|5.0|omg, this CD is completely awesome. I'm one of those people who rarely buys CDs, even if I like the music, and I went out and bought this CD after hearing only a few songs. It is WELL worth it. I play this thing constantly...Amy Lee's voice is beautiful, haunting, ethreal and there's not a bad song on the CD. At worst, you may get sick of &quot;Bring Me to Life&quot; due to it being overplayed on the radio. It has everything from hard rock to soft haunting ballads. As an added bonus, there's no profanity whatsoever. A necessary, excellent addition to anyone's collection.
630233683X|5.0|It's all been said a million times...this is the great one, the best, and you're crazy if you miss it.  Gorgeous Gene Kelly at his absolute best (a transcendent experience, to say the least!), lovely and delightful Debbie Reynolds, and the mesmerizing Cyd Charisse.  Young Donald O'Connor is also here in the performance of his career.  O'Connor is SO good as the loveably cynical Cosmo Brown that I'm boggled that the powers that be never utilized him to the full extent of his capabilities.  As Bing Crosby said about him, &quot;Is there anything he can't do?&quot;  Were the studios crazy or just plain blind to his abilities?  Up to this point O'Connor had only ever played the adolescent in &quot;B&quot; movies (and he was back at it again after SITR), but they let him play an honest-to-goodness grown-up here, and oh, how wonderful he is!  As for the sublime Mr. Kelly...Gene is ALWAYS magic, and here he is at his peak.  Please don't miss this...it ought to be part of everyone's movie library.
B000068PQ0|5.0|I can't get enough of this album. Even after a year, it is still in regular rotation on our stereo. Loved by old-school punk rock parents and 6 and 3 year olds alike. Buy one for yourself and one for your friend.
B000002LUB|4.0|First off this album crushes,but i don't consider it sabbath,i consider it Dio,with Iommi on guitar.Because the only REAL sabbath is Ozzy,tony,bill,and geezer.But this is a very heavy solid effort with classic riffs,which tony had'nt made since Mob Rules.The drum sound is amazingly crushing,like Godzilla at a funeral!!But as i said this is Dio at his finest,evil,sadistic,no holds Barr metal for the masses.Crank it up.
B000002LIM|5.0|Back in 1989, I wasn't that happy at the idea of Tim Burton directing &quot;Batman&quot;, and I definitely wasn't very happy at Danny Elfman composing the score.  All that was because they collaborated in two projects that I found stupid and ridiculous: &quot;Beetlejuice&quot; and a Pee-Wee Herman movie whose title I don't remember.<br />In a way, when I saw &quot;Batman&quot; back in 1989, I was surprised at how Tim Burton made an effort to show the Dark Knight the way his creator, Bob Kane, created him: a dark crusader who comes out at night to strike fear in the hearts of criminals.  However, I was kinda disappointed at the final result.  Yet I had to admit that Danny Elfman created a spectacular score that went beyond whatever I had hoped for.<br />'The Batman Theme' opens with a dark motif that later gives way to the spectacular theme for the Dark Knight, and I have to say that it gives a certain air of music of the classic 40s movies.  There is certain irreverence in the score, just like &quot;Beetlejuice&quot;, especially the themes Elfman created for the Joker -'Clown Attack', 'Photos/Beautiful Dreamer', 'The Joker's Poem', and 'Waltz To The Death' to name a few.  And the action music is so superb that I found it surprising that Elfman wrote this: 'Roof Fight', 'Batman To The Rescue', 'First Confrontation', and 'The Final Confrontation'.  I'd also like to say that 'Charge Of The Batmobile' and 'Attack Of The Batwing' definitely blow me away; I love 'em.  And since Batman's feats are somewhat heroic, I applaud the 'Finale', which is so epic.<br />All in all, Danny Elfman earned my respect by creating such a great score for &quot;Batman&quot;, supported by a fantastic performance by the Sinfonia Of London Orchestra under the baton of a soon-to-be great Batcomposer, Shirley Walker.
B00005221L|5.0|&quot;Predator&quot; can easily be counted among the top action movies of the eighties and can unquestionably be counted among the top Arnold Schwarzenegger movies!  This movie is quite simply, a pure action packed thriller that sets a level of intensity that few movies in the genre can match.  The action coupled with the superior score will definitely leave a first time viewer astonished at what they're watching.  For fans of this film, it is one of those that can be watched over and over and enjoyed every time, making the nominal price for this DVD inconsequential.<br />One of the elements of this film that makes it such the powerhouse that it is was the performance given by the testosterone laden cast.  Arnold Schwarzenegger's performance is brilliant in the leading role.  For him, it was the perfect role; little dialogue, lots of action, what else did he need.  The supporting cast is almost legendary for the industry; from the &quot;other&quot; governor, Jesse Ventura to Carl Weathers, all of the exceptional actors performed brilliantly.<br />Director John McTiernan did an absolutely perfect job with this movie.  Considering the phenomenal movies he's made in his career, it's easy to see why he was picked to direct them as his approach to making a movie is clearly quite appealing to moviegoers!  The job that Alan Silvestri did with the music for this movie should've won him an Oscar if it didn't.  I'd almost venture to say that despite the script and the stars, this movie might not have been as big as it was had the music for every second of the movie not been the perfect match that it was.<br />The Premise:<br />Arnold Schwarzenegger plays Dutch who appears to be a Major in the US Army and the commanding officer of an HRT (Hostage Rescue Team) that is called in to a Central American country under false pretenses to rescue some dignitaries.  Along for the ride is Carl Weathers in the role of Dillon, a former soldier that had served with Dutch but he now works for the &quot;agency.&quot;  It doesn't take long for the action to kick in as Dutch and his team soon find another team that &quot;bought it&quot; in a very odd way and not long thereafter, Dutch and his team soon find themselves dealing with something no one has ever had to deal with before...<br />I highly recommend this DVD version of &quot;Predator&quot; to any and all who are fans of the action genre, whether you've seen this film or not, this DVD is extremely well worth the nominal cost.  {ssintrepid}<br />Special Features:<br />This DVD is all about the movie and the only special feature available is the Original Theatrical Trailer.

B000089CPF|5.0|Calexico have always been good.  Their music has always struck a chord with me.  The one criticism I've had is that it veered too much into the spagetti western although it was some of what they did best.  With Feast of Wire, they moved further away from that.  Sure, its still there, but they've become more authentic.  Songs like Guero Canelo, Black Heart, Not Even Stevie Nicks, Woven Birds, &amp; Sunken Waltz make this by far the best CD of year (w/ White Stripes's Elephant taking 2nd).  Many reviews use words like masterpiece to describe this album.  I hope it isn't.  To me it feels like the build up to something truly staggering.
0060977493|5.0|This book is one of those that grow on you,the more you read them..each time,a new idea,a new question comes to light...It seems like the queen in Arabian nights, who had an endless storehouse of tales. The most amazing aspect of Arundhati's writing is its simple yet poetic style...for instance, the very title..&quot;the God of small things&quot;..it refers to the character of Velutha,an untouchable who somehow seems to touch the lives of all the protagonists in one way or another. <BR>Another interesting idea is of &quot;love laws&quot;,those laws that are set in stone for all of us..reading that book led me to question my own view of love......Love knows no definitions, no boundaries or reason....it is ,as she implies, endless,intense and spontaneous. Interestingly, the same is implied of hate...unending,baseless and destuctive. It was interesting to note this startling similarities between two emotions that have always been thought of as so different from each other....Baby Kochamma's characters clearly personifies this. But the one criticism that I feel of thie amazing book is of Baby Kochamma's character..it seems a bit sketchy,a bit too unidimensional.....I would highly recommend this book to everyone,not just to read it once,but again and again.....its a book to savour...
B00012QM8G|3.0|Schindlers List is a by-product of a society wrapped in guilt because of what another nation did sixty years ago, and the \\"feel sorry for me\\" propaganda that has followed it ever since. <BR>     From a purely cinematic standpoint it is, without a doubt, a fine film. The direction, photography, score and script are all first rate. The cast assembled includes excellent Hollywood as well as Polish actors and the performances they give are solid throughout. It is a tale well told by an experienced filmmaker. <BR>     As far as the historical accuracy the film leaves a lot to be desired. From the opening minutes it is evident that the filmmakers are products of an American educational system. The first words to appear on the screen \\"...German forces defeated the Polish Army in two weeks\\" are historically wrong, as Polish army actually surrendered in four weeks and isolated commands held out as long as 37 days. This is a prelude to many inaccuracies, half-truths and \\"blind eyes\\", which haunt this movie. The film tries to portray a Nazi party member who exploited jews, using them for SLAVE labour to HIS profit as a humannitarian. This is very interesting. Even more interesting is the fact that the polish \\"Council of Assistance for Jews\\" (RPZ)which assisted some 100 thousand jews to escape the final solution is never mentioned. The movie portrays Schindler as the only person willing to help the Jews, which is a far cry from the truth. (for those with any citicism of the Poles I invite you to visit the holocaust museum in Washington DC and see the list of names of those who saved Jews during WW2. You will see that there are more Polish names than all other nations combined.) What really upsets me about this picture is Spielbergs insistance on eluding audiences into believing that Jews were the only ones mistreated by the Germans. Lets talk about the 20 million russians who died during the war, or the 8 million Germans or the 5 million Poles. Sure Russians had Stalin to thankfor more than half that number and Germans could always count on allies carpet bombing their cities but the Jewish holocaust was not the only one is my point. There was a Polish holocaust as well, this is never mentioned, nor is the fact of French collaboration in the final solution, nor the role of the Jewish police which was almmost as brutal to their brethren as the Germans.<BR>      In the end \\"shindlers list\\" is a good film very loosely based on fact and historically rather inacurate, intended for us to grieve the Jewish losses during WW2, but not intended to tell the whole truth.
B00008NG5V|5.0|Like Ani DiFranco, Jack Johnson reminds you of the power of folk music. Jack Johnson has a feel for funk music that seeps into every song, making this album laid back and danceable at the same time. His voice is the perfect counterpart to the songs. He has a deep, expressive voice. The lyrics are impressive, too. Jack Johnson combines a smart sense of humor with political awareness. He's even thrown in a few biographical songs --- he sings about women who have lost their way and neighbors who have trouble getting along.<br />The combination of all of these elements makes this a five-star album. Jack Johnson knows how to write a catchy song, but he keeps things simple and short, never overdoing it. He'd rather stop and get to the next song than bore you. You can listen to this album all day long without getting sick of it --- and without finding a single bad song. And one more thing: If you buy this CD, you'll be supporting an independent artist. Unlike most musicians, Jack Johnson owns the copyright on his songs. If you buy this CD, you'll cut out the record company middle men.
B0001CCXZW|5.0|Oh my gosh! I can't believe they've finally put Gilmore Girls out on DVD! I'm still just kind of in shock.  If you're a big fan of the show, or you just can across it on amazon.com, you've got to buy this, because Gilmore Girls is one of those shows that has comedy, drama, and moral points in it that can relate to normal life in every way. You've got to buy this! It's hilarious!

The title &quot;don't make me think&quot; also applies to his book, it's short and to the point. This book should be required reading for all web designers out there.

B00005KARK|5.0|For me, the most interesting thing about &quot;Dumbo&quot; is it's history. It was made during the war and Walt needed something that was inexpensive to make, so he bought the rights to the children's book of the same name. The film is only 64 minuites long, but if it where any longer,it would get boring. What's trueley remarkable about &quot;Dumbo&quot; is that the main character never talks, but is able to express so much emotion. The scene where Mrs. Jumbo is cradeling Dumbo with her trunk from inside her jail cell is one of the most touching moments in Disney history. The picture and sound is restored and the special features are pretty good. I wish it would have gotten a 2-disc release because I know Disney has more content in there vaults that they could have filled up another disc with. And the work in progress trailor for &quot;Dumbo 2&quot; disturbes me. I wish Disney wouldn't make sequels to films Walt made.
B000002JSN|5.0|In 1975, Led Zeppelin released their only double-album, &quot;Physical Graffiti,&quot; a brilliant Zeppelin mish-mash that combines eight songs the band recorded specifically for the album, plus seven leftover tracks recorded during the sessions for &quot;Led Zeppelin III,&quot; &quot;IV,&quot; and &quot;Houses Of The Holy&quot; that the band wanted to give a proper home to. It's quite a balancing act, but it works, as &quot;Physical Grafitti&quot; is yet another Led Zeppelin classic.Of the songs the band specifically laid down for &quot;Physical Grafitti,&quot; the most famous one by far is &quot;Kashmir,&quot; without a doubt Led Zeppelin's second-most beloved song in their catalog, second only to &quot;Stairway To Heaven.&quot; This legendary Zeppelin rocker, with it's Eastern-influenced force &amp; swagger, is simply a monster, and, like &quot;Stairway,&quot; it contains all the classic trademarks of this legendary band in a single song: Robert Plant's seductive voice that can just as easily rise into an air-raid siren, Jimmy Page's precise, rock-god command of the guitar strings, John Paul Jones' powerful bass &amp; keyboard work, and, to cap it off, John Bonham's knockout, sledgehammer attack on the drums. It's no wonder this Zeppelin number is so cherished by both the fans and the band themselves. But &quot;Kashmir&quot; is in darn good company with many other classic Zeppelin songs on this album, including the equally-brilliant rockers &quot;In My Time Of Dying,&quot; &quot;In The Light,&quot; &quot;Ten Years Gone,&quot; the album's opening shot &quot;Custard Pie,&quot; and the thrilling, head-bobbing, foot-stomper that is &quot;Trampled Underfoot&quot; (which is said to have been inspired by the Stevie Wonder hit, &quot;Superstition&quot;).As for the album's outtakes assortment, they're just as excellent. The band brilliantly rock out on &quot;The Rover&quot; and &quot;Night Flight,&quot; &quot;Houses Of The Holy&quot; &amp; &quot;Down By The Seaside&quot;are wonderful, melodic songs (and I love that daring shift in tempo and back again during &quot;Seaside&quot;), &quot;Bron-Yr-Aur&quot; is a classy acoustic showcase for Page, and &quot;Boogie With Stu&quot; is just plain fun, with some great ragtime piano from Jones.Admittedly, &quot;Physical Graffiti&quot; would've worked just as well as a single album, as the outtakes would've greatly benefitted the band's sparse release of odds-and-sods, &quot;Coda,&quot; but no matter. &quot;Physical Graffiti&quot; is a fantastic Led Zeppelin album, and worth every penny of the double-CD price.
B00003CXCQ|5.0|&quot;Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs&quot; has been a huge success since its initial release in the 30's. As a kid, it was one of the few Disney movies that I hadn't seen, until its home video release in '94. It instantly became one of my favorite Disney films. This DVD release is amazing. There are so many special features and they are all interesting. My personal favorite is the commentary by Walt Disney himself. They edited together audio clips from different interviews and they are played during scenes that are relevant to what's going on in the film. As for the restoration, Disney touched it up so perfectly that it looks new. The audio sounds like it was recorded in the 30's, but has been restored so you never hear any pops and crackles. Whether you are a Disney fan, an animation or movie buff, or someone who is buying this for their kids, no DVD collection is complete without it. Since it is out of print, I recommend trying to track down a copy because it won't come back out of the vault for at least four years.
B00005TT77|2.0|Theres really only a couple of good renditions on here. Two of Us,Youve got to hide your love, Im only sleeping, and maybe Across the universe.Dont let me down is tolerable too.  Otherwise theres alot of crap. Revolution is unlistenable, mother natures son sung by Sheryl Crow doesnt even sound like her, its sounds like Britney Spears. Im looking through you is weak, Let it Be is pointless. It just goes to show you that you dont mess with Beatle songs, they are sacred. Best Beatle cover ever is She said ,She said by Government Mule.
B00004R997|3.0|This film was made during the war and Walt didn't have the money to turn out another full length animated film. To appease his fans, he made a film which is basically a trip with him and some of his best animators &quot;South of the Border.&quot; The animators where then inspired to make several short animated films, which are all packaged together to make this feature. The back of the box says &quot;Total Running Time: Approc. 75 Minuites.&quot; By total running time, the mean with special features. The film is only 45 minuites, and the bonus &quot;South of the Border With Disney&quot; was a television show he did. If you are not a Disney fan, I don't recomend this film to you, because it is not like the other well known animated films you are used to. The picture and sound are not very good. Disney didn't feel the need to tough it up because hardley anyone knew of it's existance.
B0000TB01Y|2.0|The only reason I gave a two star rating is for the two women that tried very hard to make this show and music work.  I anticipated seeing this show for months.  I am a great fan of the book and could not wait to see it brought to life on the stage.  As it has happened many times in the past the play did not represent the book that I had read.  The script was sugar coated for the general public to digest.  When are producers and directors going to realize that theatre is not a breakfast cereal?  We don' t need the sweet stuff.  Now to my point about the music I believe I could have overlooked poor handling of the book if I had been given music to be excited about.  Mr. Schwartz did not live up to his task.  I noticed in another review that the reviewer could not wait until the Tony Awards.  If this show or score is nominated it will be solely because there has not been a great deal of new creations on Broadway to get excited about and if the nominations come they will leave the stage without the Tony Award.
B00001QEE9|5.0|As a kid, my friends and I never wanted to watch this movie. It wasn't until I was in my teens when I decided to give this film another shot. I mean, if the theme song, &quot;When You Wish Upon A Star,&quot; is used on Disney's logo, then a lot of people must like it. I have loved this film from then on. This DVD release is very lacking, because it was one of their first DVD's released. The picture and sound where restored, but the only special feature is the original trailor. It is out of print and hard to comeby, but it will be part of the &quot;Platinum Edition&quot; series, so I'd wait a couple of years for the 2-disc release.

B000002H6C|5.0|Simply put, this album rocks! Just like Master of Puppets, there is not one song I even remotely dislike on this album. People say this album sucks because of its raw production, and I'll admit the production is rather raw, but it's the music that matters, and ...And Justice For All excels in that department. Sure, you may not be able to hear the bass, but the crushing guitar riffs more than make up for it.<br />This album starts off with a pure metal song called Blackened. This song has everything: thought-provoking lyrics about the end of the world (makes you think, doesn't it?), rockin' riffs, and a killer solo. Tied with Damage, inc. from Master of Puppets as my all-time favorite Metallica song.<br />Now, on to the title track. It starts off with a mellow first 40 seconds, but then goes to rock your socks off. Some say this song drags on a little too long (9 minutes and 44 seconds), but those almost 10 minutes will not by any means be wasted by listening to this song.<br />Next, Eye of the Beholder. A very interesting song. It's a very heavy song too, might I add. The lyrics are very poetic in this song.<br />Then comes One. This song has it all. Fans of the softer Metallica music will enjoy listening to the beginning of the song, and hardcore fans can headbang to the last 3 minutes until their heads get sore. A very powerful song. Metallica have won 2 awards for this song. Firstly, they won their first Grammy award for this song. Plus, the solo was voted #7 in a list of the top 100 rock/metal solos. It deserves #1, though. Trust me.<br />Now we move on to a song I find extremely underrated, called The Shortest Straw. When I first listened to this song, it was stuck in my head for a couple weeks. The Shortest Straw is extremely catchy and pretty thrashy. You could headbang to this song all day long!<br />Next up, Harvester of Sorrow. In my mind, this is Metallica's heaviest song. It's like The Thing That Should Not Be part 2. It's very heavy, and it's very dark.<br />On to The Frayed Ends of Sanity, another underrated song. This song starts off with a Wizard of Oz reference, and then goes into Metallica heavy metal mode. Another good headbanging song.<br />Next up, To Live Is To Die, a salute to the late Cliff Burton, who died a few months after Master of Puppets was released. This song could be considered an instrumental, since the only lyrics are only a few lines written by Cliff Burton himself before the bus accident. But still, it's a VERY powerful song.<br />Finally, Dyers Eve. This song is very thrashy and aggressive. It's a perfect song to listen to when your parents give you grief. Just don't let them hear it. This song is like my anthem. I can totally relate to it.<br />Overall, ...And Justice For All is another masterpiece. A must-have for any metalhead.
B0000TB01Y|5.0|I will start of by saying that I have NOT read the book nor seen the live show on Broadway. Whether you have or not, you should definatly buy this recording if you are fan of The Wizard of Oz, Steven Swartz, or Broadway. <BR>   <BR>I must admit that I was very dissappointed to learn that the recording did not include a synopsys of the show. I learned later that it was omitted because the producers did not want to give anything away to people who haven't seen the show. I also learned that they omitted a song from the stage version, &quot;Wicked Witch of the East&quot; due to potential spoilers. That upset me a little, but what is still on this recording is, in a word, fabulous.<BR>   <BR>The performances are all outstanding, but Idida Menzel (Maureen from RENT and Kate from THE WILD PARTY) as Elphaba (taken from the original Wizard of Oz's initials: L.F.Baum) stands out above the rest. Her vocal talent is amazing and this recording showcases it beautifully. <BR>   <BR>Kristin Chenoweth (Sally in YOU'RE A GOOD MAN CHARLIE BROWN)is equally amazing. Their chemistry as G(a)linda and Elphaba is felt in every song and their harmonies are executed without a flaw.<BR>   <BR>Joel Gray (Original Emcee in CABARET, Amos in the revival of CHICAGO and many more) is the epitomy of what I imagined the Wizard to be. He is &quot;Wondeful&quot; in this part, and he seems to be taken right out of the original book by L. Frank Baum. <BR>   <BR>Overall, this is an amazing recording. Of course, a few songs I skip over (Dear old Shiz, Something Bad) but the rest of the songs make up for these two. They are just not as entertaining to me. I only wish that they would have included the omitted song and also a synopsis. Although, I think that seeing the show and experiencing all the twists and turns (believe me there are A LOT) would be fun. <BR>   <BR>This CD is a MUST! You will NOT regret buying it!
0805062971|5.0|I was reading reviews about this book, and I saw some that referred to it as &quot;jockalicious.&quot;  I don't see how Palahniuk's &quot;Fight Club&quot; is like this in anyway.  The story starts out with the narrator in a rather dull, desperate point in his life.  He can't sleep, he hates his boss, and all he has is his materials that he is constantly consuming from the market.  In a desperate attempt to find something new, he gets addicted to going to support groups, where he feels he can actually talk and have people listen to him.  As we get further into the book, we find that his home, his quaint little products, everything, are all destroyed.  However, he makes a friend (Tyler), who opens his mind about a lot of things: consumer America, materialism, parents, etc.  The two form a group known as Fight Club.  Why?  Because they're jocks.  JUST KIDDING.  They do it because they can finally vent their feelings of anger, frustration, whatever, and they can do it together, forming a strange kind of common bond among the members.  However, as the we get further into it, we find that there is more to Fight Club than just venting rage, and it slowly takes a turn for the worst, with a wicked twist of a climax.  Written with an extremely dark, cynical, yet hilarious outlook on things, Palahniuk takes the story of the average man's life and turns it into a nightmare, the reader not wanting to put the book down the entire time.  Jocky?  I think not.  &quot;Fight Club&quot; simply delves into the darker side of the human condition, creating a fantastic fable, and cannot be missed.
B0001BKAEY|5.0|Most people seem to be dissapointed in this film for some reason or another.  Upon hearing these grievances prior to watching the film, I've become immune to its flaws (Ha ha!! I'm the only person I know who actually LIKES this film!!!!).<br />The characters are as well portrayed as before, if not moreso. It's interesting to see how the machine programs have become more human. But there's no further development on them.  The acting is the same as before.<br />The story itself is what really matters for the film. It doesn't have as much action as \\"Reloaded,\\" but the battle of Zion is definately worth seeing. It's a twenty-minute extravaganza of flying machines, pummels crashing through everything, APUs marching around, and missiles flying everywhere. There's also Neo's fight with Bane, which is one of the more brilliant parts of the film.  It's a suspenseful scene that also allows Neo to evolve.  Directly afterwards is Neo and Trinity's desparate flight to Machine City, and Neo's battle with Agent Smith, where the directors utilize their awesome cinematography skills for the climax.<br />I do have to say that the climax of the film is not what I've been expecting. From the beginning, I always got the impression that Neo would destroy the machines from their source. Ultimately, however, the ending that \\"Revolutions\\" has is more logical. The conflicts are resolved in a way that allows mankind to make a choice for itself (and without wiping out mankind). It's as if the equasions of the film are balancing themselves out.<br />The ending is ultimately a sacriligious one.  Neo gives his life to save humanity.  This idea is complimented with imagery that makes Neo look divine in his death.<br />The final scene makes the inference that Neo may return. I doubt that a fourth Matrix film will ensue, but I'm thinking that they'll produce a Matrix TV show, thus allowing the franchise to reach every venue of media.  Neo and Trinity may yet return, although I'm remaining skeptical about it, but it may be possible that the machines will heal and resurrect them.<br />With an open mind and without reservations, this final chapter of the Matrix trilogy may be enjoyable, particuarly for fans. But you'd have to see it for yourself.about it, but it may be possible that the machines will heal and resurrect them.<br />With an open mind and without reservations, this final chapter of the Matrix trilogy may be enjoyable, particuarly for fans.

0385504209|2.0|I won't rehash the plot since there are so many reviews before me.  I can't believe there was so much hype on this book.  It took me weeks to finish it because I just could not get into it.  The only reason I am giving it two stars is because the last few chapters were real page turners.  However the ending was a complete dud.
B00005B36H|5.0|this is the album that got me into music, seriously, no one is the same after they hear this.
B00000IQW3|5.0|If you're looking for a masterpiece film that rewrites the sci-fi genre with intense drama and gritty characters, this isn't the movie for you.  If you're looking for a really fun film that's a great mix of Star Wars, Saturday morning cartoons, and video games then stick this in your DVD player.<br />The movie's special effects hold up suprisingly well, considering that they're 20 years old.  When Alex Rogan is flying the gunstar, it's like you're there with him, especially if you grew up loving this film.  The characters are developed enough that you care, but not so much that it's like a daytime soap opera.  Two thumbs up!
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|once again, picked up the single and then bought it outright, sure glad i did. haunting, and beautiful.
0452282152|4.0|This last sentence of Tracy Chevalier's novel sums up all the irony associated with being a poor woman in the 17th Century.  Until the end of this novel, Griet has absolutely no control over any part of her life.  Even at the end, her choice is not much of a choice; it is based on economic necessity.  This novel is an amazing portrait of the life of a maid in Delft during this time period.<br />Indeed, Griet's occupation as a maid is dictated for her.  Her parents simply tell her she will go to work as a maid; she has no voice in the matter.  Once at the Vermeer's household, she has no choice about the job responsibilities she will fulfill, whether she will pose for a painting, and from whom she will take orders.  Even her few small possessions are not her own.  In addition to this lack of control, Griet is subject to injustices at every turn, such as being accused of theft, fending off advances tactfully from wealthy patrons, and being disliked by every person in the house except her master.<br />Griet's master, Vermeer, is perhaps the most interesting character in this novel.  While not outwardly unkind to Griet, he inflicts the most damage upon her self-esteem and sense of self-worth.  He is portrayed as not an unkind man, but not a kind one either.  He is utterly self-absorbed, and only does things when they benefit him in some way.  Despite this, he is pitiable, because he is so clearly miserable with his life.  Even when he comes to Griet's aid, it is so that she can remain his assistant.<br />This was a fascinating historical fictional account of a little-known but tremendously gifted artist.  Beautifully and sensitively written, at the book's end you will feel you know the Papist's Corner and Vermeer's house therein--as well as it can be known, anyway.

B00005JKN9|3.0|Priest Vallon (Liam Neeson) is the leader of the Dead Rabbits gang. William 'Bill the Butcher' Cutting (Daniel Day-Lewis) is the leader of the Nativist gang.  Both gangs wage a bloody war against eachother, ending in the death of Priest Vallon.  Witnessing this tragedy is Vallon's son (Leonardo DiCaprio) who  is sent to a reformatory for delinquents.  Some years later, he returns as Amsterdam to seek revenge against Bill the Butcher, his father's killer.  The worst thing about this movie were the Irish accents of Cameron Diaz and Leonardo DiCaprio.  They were bad enough to make your ears bleed.  The movie was ok but it really didn't need to be over three hours long.

B00005JMJ4|5.0|Okay, most people have a top ten list, but actually this is the *only* movie I've seen this year that's got everything: great acting, an intelligent script, beautiful camera work, an exotic setting shot with subtlety and flair. It's funny, sad, and sexy. <br />Others have summarized the plot so I won't repeat that here. I will say that Bill Murray is perfect as the weary, wary semi-famous actor doing liquor commericials for big money in Japan. There's not a moment that feels overplayed. He just manages to be completely believable, second by second. Like all great actors, he reveals by witholding-- it's clear he desires the beautiful Charlotte (played with equal perfection by Scarlett Johansson); his tenderness toward her, the intensity of what he yearns for is as clear by what doesn't happen as by what does.<br />Johansson perfectly plays a 20-something wife, whose photographer husband is more interested in work and glitz thanin her.She's looking for answers in self-help tapes, Buddhist temples, ikkebana (Japanese flowerr-arranging) and late-night calls to uncomprehending friends. There's a killer scene in which he lets her stand there while a Hollywood ingenue gushes over him, and again when he barely suppresses his eagerness to be out of their Tokyo hotel room and on the road. <br />While both characters are lost in their marriages, neither spouse is flat or easily dismissed. Charlotte feels lost in the world; at sea in  life and marriage. Bill Murray's character is just over-the-hill as an actor, not-quite-but-almost-famous. His wife keeps faxing him bitter notes and Fed Exing capret samples. He's jet-lagged, lonely, and alone. But this is not a sad sack movie. It's really about the ineffable relationships that can form and even forge a life without quite changing the course of it. And it beautifully captures not only Tokyo, and its blurring rushed pace, but also those encounters of youth which we half-remember and never wholly forget. <br />Coppola's script is subtle and perfect, the pace is European-style -- which is to say, human scale. The scenes of Japan are breathtaking, making a totally foreign place seem as real as the chair in which we sit. She captures the dreaminess of youth, its tempting possibilities and terrible loneliness and beauty. I think that's what makes it seem like such a fresh and youthful film-- even though Murray is front and center throughout, it's really a movie told through the lens of youth. <br />This is the ONLY movie I want to see more than once this year. It belongs in that precious category of movies like \\"Falling in Love,\\" \\"Swept Away,\\" \\"Indochine\\" that leave a lasting impression because they feel so pure and true.
B00008G9JM|5.0|The remastered cd of Jethro Tull's A Passion Play is the most powerful example of the benefits of remastering on Rock cds I've ever heard. The quality and care taken on this edition is just impressive. There is a clarity and distinctness in the music that was lacking in the previous pressings. I would not be surprised if critical acceptance of A Passion Play rises and this release will be seen as one of Tull's two or three best recordings. It's that much an improvement.<br />What is stunning is the virtuousity of the music, Anderson's flute, Barre's guitar, the drumming and even the sax seem energized beyond what the original recording offered. That's not to say I wasn't a fan of A Passion Play before. I've always considered it one of Tull's best and most underappreciated works.<br />Negative reviews and a general lack of critical acceptance when A Passion Play was released almost made Tull cease touring. One can really see a decline in Tull's quality that begin's after APP, much of it due to the disappointment an disillusionment by Anderson over its critical rejection.<br />Included within the cd is the original Passion Play film, charming and amateurish with a real Pythonesque quality. The only real downside as many have said, is the not splitting the tracks into individual segments. Yes you'll have to hear The Hare...several time (although, even here, the remastering does wonders with the background music).<br />For non-fans this might be difficult stuff but well worth the effort. If you are a fan of Jethro Tull and do not have the enhanced edition I strongly urge you to get it, you won't be disappointed.<br />The remastered A Passion Play gets the highest recommendation- a serious reappraisal is well deserved by music critics.
031286504X|5.0|Yes, this book is a timeless classic. Although written in 1954, it could have been written yesterday. Its a story that will grab you, and make you think about it for a long time afterwards. Its definitely a 5 star book, and one everybody should read. If you want to know why its called &quot;I am Legend&quot;, you will just have to read it. Believe me, you wont be disappointed with it. I have seldom picked up a book that has made me rant to family and friends about how good it is - but this is one that I will happily rant on about. If you dont read anything else this year, make sure you have read this. Fantastic stuff!
006107327X|5.0|The best compendium of modern TV animation layout and design currently available.  These artists revolutionized TV animation, and this book is something that everyone interested in the field must have.  Strong work, and very good presentation here, especially the storyboard sequences.  Good for artists as a learning aid, or as entertainment for fans of the show, whatever age.  Clear, uncluttered presentation from the Warners studio archives.  A good history of the show, and a great lesson in how to develop an animated project.  You should have this sense of design based on strength, simplicity, drama and clarity.
B000002L9O|4.0|After the resurgence of the Ramones with \\"Too Tough to Die,\\" the boys decided to leave co-producers Ed Stasium and Tommy Erdelyi (original drummer Tommy Ramone) behind.  The production of \\"Animal Boy\\" was entrusted to ex-Plasmatics bass player Jean Beauvoir after he produced their single \\"Bonzo Goes to Bitburg,\\" which is also included on the album.  The problem with that single applies to the album as a whole: it's a good Ramones song in the traditional sense, but the production is way too clean-sounding, with thin guitars and unnecessary synth/electronic effects.  The drums sound weak, there's no punch to them at all.  It's like Beauvoir was trying to turn the Ramones into just another 80's radio pop-rock act.  The most extreme example of the production bringing the album down has to be \\"She Belongs to Me,\\" which has to be the wimpiest Ramones song ever recorded.  The synthesizers drive the ballad along, with barely a trace of guitar to be heard.  \\"Howling at the Moon\\" used  some electronics too, but at least the guitars still sounded beefy and the drums had some power to them.  Walter Lure (ex-Heartbreakers) did some guitar work on \\"Animal Boy,\\" so the level of Johnny's involvement is questionable.<br />On the plus side, you do get the early experiments with a faster, more hardcore-influenced sound that started on \\"Too Tough to Die.\\"  \\"Animal Boy\\" and \\"Eat That Rat\\" are among the faster Ramones material, with Dee Dee's snotty vocals making the latter a kind of \\"Wart Hog II.\\"  Dee Dee also sings on \\"Love Kills,\\" a now-classic song about Sid and Nancy.  It's ironic in a depressing way to hear Dee Dee sing the line \\"Drugs don't ever pay,\\" though.  <br />\\"Somebody Put Something in My Drink,\\" supposedly based on Richie Ramone drinking a cocktail spiked with LSD, features Joey shouting/singing a little harsher than usual.  This is another change in the Ramones sound that started on Too Tough to Die.  With the production, though, Richie comes off sounding like a drum machine.  Other strong songs include \\"Crummy Stuff,\\" \\"Mental Hell,\\" and \\"Something to Believe in,\\" the pop single that should have shot the Ramones to #1 on the charts.  In my opinion, the below-average Ramones songs that they recorded in the 80's were still better than most of their 90's output.  Like \\"Apeman Hop,\\" for example.  I have as yet to hear a positive comment about this song, but I happen to like it.  It's got the classic three chord approach that made the Ramones famous, and bizarre lyrics about a cannibalistic monkey man.  Maybe it's the Tarzan vocals on the chorus that alienated people.  To me it's another comic-book episode from my favorite band of all time.  Like \\"Cretin Hop\\" and \\"We're A Happy Family,\\" with the Ramones it was often better when the lyrics made no sense.

B0000DJZA5|5.0|...from either side. Think for yourself, as George would say. Chances are if people hadn't been aware of the volatile working conditions during the making of this album/movie, there would be no talk of it being a lesser recording. The band is just as hard-driving and just as searching as on other albums. It was a step back only in the most marginal way (that they'd simply play the songs without any overdubs). The songwriting and the musicianship is perfectly in sync with the meteoric ascent that began around Rubber Soul and continued upward. We also hear John handling more of the lead guitars, a position in which I had vastly underrated him until recently revisiting this album.  As for the updated version, it's all a matter of taste. If you prefer the Spector versions, or have lived with them for so long that you feel no need to confuse things, you could probably do without \\"...Naked.\\" As for me, listening to the new versions, \\"The Long and Winding Road\\" still seems perhaps overly sappy and sentimental, but to a much lesser degree without Spector's touch. \\"Let it Be\\" and \\"I Me Mine\\" are not greatly altered, and in fact these are all great songs in both versions. The best thing about this reissue, however, is the inclusion of John's glorious \\"Don't Let Me Down\\" at the expense of the totally superfluous \\"Dig It\\" and \\"Maggie Mae\\". The second disc, the so-called \\"Fly on the Wall\\" disc, is 20 minutes of studio jabbering, and is strictly for the most desperate of fanatics (of which I am proudly one). Now just give us a spruced-up DVD of the film and let us be.

0385504209|5.0|I am a 14 year old kid , and I can definatley say that the Davinci Code by Dan Brown is the best book that I have ever read. It beats anything by Grsham, Ludlum , or Cook. This book dives into its plot when symbologist Robert Langdon recieves and urgent phone call in the middle of the night. He is told to come to the Luve museum in Paris to investigate a murder. From there he meets a mysterious young women named Sophie Neveu ,  and from there they investigate the crime commited at the Lueve and a seceret that has been hidden for thousands of years. By reading this review , I know that you do not get the best picture of the book , but I am telling you , you will not fully understand how amazing this novel is until you actually pick it up yourselves. I highly recomend tis book to anyone os any age that loves a great read , I hope that this review was helpful to you.
0743244249|3.0|DeLillo's latest novel continues his tradition of being more interested in the ideas his characters represent than in the characters themselves.  This is not necessarily a criticism; it just means that one must come to his novels with different expectations.  DeLillo is a master of writing brilliant scenes, and often likes to lead off a book with a particularly wonderful set piece.  In Mao II, it was a Moonie mass wedding; in Underworld, it was the fateful baseball game in 1954 which decided the World Series and which occurred simultaneously with the explosion of the Soviet Union's first H-Bomb.<br />Cosmopolis does not lead off with such a set piece, but contains many wonderfully executed scenes, such as the anarchist riot, the funeral cortege for a dead rapper named Brother Fez, and the movie shoot involving hundreds of naked people lying in the street.<br />But for all the brilliance of these individual scenes, the whole is somewhat unconvincing; characters talk to each other in abstractions, their actions not always believable.  In particular, the scene where Eric Packer shoots another character in an off-handed, impulsive manner did not fit the person who in other scenes shows compassion, for example, for his limo driver.  That scene in particular felt like the author's hand forcing the action out of a desire to derive delicious irony from it, but without regard to whether it fit what the character would actually do.<br />Yet despite these faults, this book is so compelling in some of its scenes that it is definitely worthy of reading and reflection.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I heard of this series from a review on NPR's 'Fresh Air'. Intrigued about the fact that Fox had so butchered a good show, I checked it out.  It was quite simply great!  I rented it from Netflix, and couldn't wait for each disk to arrive.  I was truly sorry after I had viewed the last one.  I know there is serious talk of a movie, but I really hope that some company funds a comeback of the series.  It could really go.  This series made Farscape look like something targetted to 7 year olds (and maybe it was).  Sincere kudos to Whedon and Minear and double kudos to the casting director for finding Morena Baccarin (OMG!).
B000127LW2|1.0|How people can write reviews for a DVD set that has not been released yet is beyond me. Morons, the purpose of these reviews is to let other people know whether this DVD set is worth getting.

6305657947|5.0|The above succinctly could summarize the slick cat and mouse game that ensues between Catherine Banning and Thomas Crown in a stylishly, visually stunning remake of &lt;i>The Thomas Crown Affair&lt;/i>.  For those looking for a couple hours of pure escapism and enjoyment for adults over 30, this is it.<br />As has already been said in many reviews, Pierce Brosnan assumes the role Steve McQueen made famous in 1968.  It is quickly established that Crown is wealthy, handsome, powerful...and bored.  So, with his sharp intellect, he sets about stealing a priceless painting -- just so he can feel the rush.  Pierce Brosnan plays Crown as very dashing and low key...and it works here, especially because of the game.  For him to show too much would be to tip his hand, so Crown keeps his pursuer, Catherine, on her toes as she both tries to pin the crime on him -- and avoid falling under a spell that she finds appealing in spite of herself which, in the end, makes it all the more fascinating to see her try to trip &lt;i>him&lt;/i> up at various turns.  As many others have noted, it is less cat and mouse than smart and smarter cat, and it is fascinating to watch them tangle -- physically, intellectually, and emotionally -- as the stakes seem to intensify in terms of job vs. romance.<br />Rene Russo is wonderful as Catherine Banning.  While Faye Dunaway's Vicky Anderson was considered strong for her time in the 1968 version, she still seemed too \\"mushy\\" in the end, too \\"heart on her sleeve\\".  Catherine in the 1999 version, though, picked up where Vicky left off and yes, heresy to purists, I'm sure, improved on Vicky's strengths and toned down the other stuff.  Catherine is strong, worldly, fiesty, and has a take no prisoners attitude that is &lt;i>occasionally&lt;/i> (and subtley) allowed to be offset by vulnerability and softness.  Overall, however, Catherine is, as Faye Dunaway's [Vicky in 1968's \\"TCA\\"] therapist character notes in the film, a mirror image of Thomas.  And thisallows for the complication of Catherine being drawn into Thomas, first as a suspect but ultimately as someone she is fascinated by and could all too easily love.<br />I will not give away the ending...but I never knew the use of a simple bowler hat could be so clever, and use a painting with one as a nice inside joke.  John McTiernan was a man who knew how to use cinematography to his film's advantage, and it shows.  It is colorful, sharp, and slick...the perfect counterpart to the leads.<br />Still, before I end this, I must give major props to Denis Leary.  Before viewing this, all I knew him as was an acidic, tart comic with an edge.  But as Detective Michael McCann, he goes toe to toe with Russo and succeeds brilliantly.  McCann is also a jaded man, a New York City cop, but he also has a sense of intelligence just as the leads do, and he is genuinely likeable and downright droll.  You can't help but root for him in spite of his target...and the fact that he seems to also have a tiny crush on Catherine makes this game even more \\"twisty\\", and the end result is somewhat bittersweet.<br />Thankfully, this movie's romance is with two adults of the same generation and not some 40ish-year-old man going after a 20-something babe in tight clothes.  The fact that it is sexy, slzzling, and even tender proves that chemistry does not have to die once your 30s are through!  Russo and Brosnan sparkled!<br />I highly recommend buying the DVD.  This is a film you'll want to view more than once.
B0000VAFO0|1.0|This is the worst movie I've seen since Glitter.  And at least Glitter was good for a few laughs.  I really enjoy horror movies (The Howling, Evil Dead, etc), and I enjoy a good bit of entertaining action (Blade), but this movie was neither scary nor entertaining.  I've never written a review before, but seeing this piece of garbage pop up on my screen as a &quot;Top Seller&quot; really inspired me.
0345452577|3.0|I won't sum up again, that's been done countless times on this one already.  Psychological thriller is a pretty accurate two-word summary!<br />The story was interesting, if not exactly gripping. I like the fact that Carrier wasn't able to make unrealistic instant intuitive leaps, and that he logically and credibly worked the &quot;mystery&quot; out on his own. The characters were well-defined and believable. The plot was intricate enough to keep me guessing, as a reader, and not blatantly obvious. Carrier's relationship with Angela was very well done, his shying away from any discussion of his past or especially his relationship with Jocelyn. When Angela began working closely with Dirgrove, I thought at first that it was uncharacteristic of her, since she seemed very taken with Carrier --- but then she proved to be true to her personality when Dirgrove hit on her and she told Carrier about it immediately. Doresh showing up to &quot;save the day&quot; at climactic moment was allowable because of his evident and continual distrust of Carrier, although I am a bit skeptical at those &quot;just in time&quot; rescues. However, the book was an overall good story, and well plotted with convincing three-dimensional characters. I'd rather read more Delaware books than Carrier, though.
B00006ALGL|5.0|Quite simply put, this albulmn will make you ache.  Specifically Blower's Daughter and Cannonball will break your heart.  Damien's music seems to pull deep emotion up to just below the surface of your skin.  His music captures and conveys the bittersweet agony of being in love. Several songs on the albumn nearly brought me to tears. Although I found this to be somehow disturbing I am willing to conceed that this is an indication of a truly stunning musical experience.
B000002WEH|5.0|For as much as Elvis  is over- hyped  his best work is overlooked. Exhibit # 1, Elvis in Memphis .   Ever time I put E. I. M.  in  the car's tape player I have to pull  over to the side of the road to clear my eyes and   ask myself  &quot;Is this really Elvis&quot;  and&quot; where was this Elvis his whole career&quot; . Curse you  Tom  Parker ! <br /> As much as the Sun Sessions define  rock and roll ,EIM   defines the  country Memphis sound. I always have  EIM accessible  in my car, my desert island ,for those times when life's journey takes me down that gravel road.
B000000OQF|5.0|In the middle of a constelation of glam bands (some of them great bands) arose a group of guys who redefined the music industry, they just needed one album, just one great album, that album was Appetite for destruction, with a colection of brilliant songs the disc became a masterpiece, just listen some of the tracks: Welcome to the jungle (awesome opening), Sweet child o' mine (with the best riff ever), Rocket queen, Think about you, etc... this guys were simply genious... Guns n' roses, we will never forget you.
B0001BKAEY|4.0|The general critical consensus was that the third Matrix film was a failure: it \\"failed\\" to do anything new, it \\"repeated\\" the \\"formulas\\" of the other films, that it ultimately wound up as \\"little more\\" than a B-war movie. Well, guess what, friends: if anyone had really paid attention to the first film, you would have gotten the clear message that, actually, it WAS about an impending war. In fact, the third film really could not have been anything else than what it was - the logical conclusion to the various threads set up in the first two films.<br />It is not always necessary to look for newer, better cheap thrills - this is one of the curses of our present culture. What is necessary is to complete the story correctly - and, personally, I think that's exactly what has been given in this film. <br />One can debate the totality of the films' various \\"philosophical\\" and \\"mystical\\" animae - but, for me, the enjoyment of all three  derives from the totality of its architecture, the completeness of its vision. I'm not really interested in searching for \\"deep meanings\\" from comic books \\"come to life.\\" I take the three films together as a remarkably congent fantasy - done with much tongue-in-cheek. Shakespeare or Pirandello or Henry James it isn't - but, then again, neither is Flash Gordon, Star Wars or even the LOTR cycle for all of that series' gravitas. <br />So, in the end, one should just sit back and enjoy one of the better fantasy film series of recent years - don't look for hidden meanings that aren't there. All the elements work together at their own level.
B00005NWM3|1.0|I came here specifically to vent. If I hear &quot;How You Remind Me&quot; on the radio one more time, I might throw the radio out the window. This is the most mediocre, overplayed band I have heard since...since...well, since the crapfest known as The Gin Blossoms.
B00005JMTN|5.0|This is one of those truly entertaining movies.  If not for the movie's plot, for the stories it tells.  And Ed Bloom does have some stories to tell!  The adorable Billy Crudup (Will Bloom, Ed's son) was the only plot character that seemed to be missing some depth, but his dashing good looks forgive him for it.<br />Albert Finney plays the elder Bloom, who, though on his death bed, is still very alive. Ewan McGregor is warm-hearted and loveable as the younger Bloom.<br />The admiration between Jessica Lange (the elder Mrs. Sandra Bloom) and Albert Finney is beautiful.  I loved the bathtub scene, where she climbs in with him, dress and all.<br />Stop researching this movie, and just go see it.  It's that good!

I basically get annoyed to have all that, and then a dud ending. This book is so interesting all the way through and then - DUD! It doesn't just have a weak ending, it has an ending that seems to be for an entirely different book.  I was left wondering why I spent the time. Skip it.

0375758992|4.0|Alexandra provides an almost third person perspective on Africa in that it comes from the innocent eyes of a child and teenager.  Alexandra's life is actually very typical for a white person growing up there with its trials, and tribulations levied against the wonderful joys of Africa.  <br />The book shines in the nuisances of life there as she tells her story of growing up in Zimbabwe only to be forced to move to Malawi and then Zambia.  Over the last 7 or so years, I have spent about 2 years total in these countries.  While to an outsider the travails of life there may seem horrendously difficult, they are actually quite typical.  Life is hard there, even for the expats.  <br />Owning some 1000 books on Africa, I would say this book is excellent and a worthwhile read, but stop short of giving it the classic billing that others have.  She gives an excellent list of recommended reading in the back of her book.  Read some of my other reviews for some more ideas.

B000002G87|5.0|'Layla' is not only Clapton's pinnacle,(at age 25!), it may be the peak end-point for the musical cross-influencing of American and British roots and pop together. Clapton is a sponge, first absorbing the likes of Robert Johnson, Big Bill Broonzy,   the three Kings, (BB, Albert ,and Freddy), Otis Rush and Buddy Guy, and then moving into the US to further his education at the hands of our best and brightest: Duane Allman, Bobby Whitlock, Delaney Bramlett, and JJ Cale. Combine all of these influences wth the lessons in pop structure learned from the Beatles,(mostly George), and you're left with all the tools. All that was needed was the heart and soul, as provided by his then-unrequited love for George's then-wife Patty Boyd, (soon to be Eric's), and the brew for the best music of the era is complete.PS: A little-known fact that makes the heartfelt message of 'Layla',(the song),  even deeper: The lead guitar theme's first seven notes are borrowed from the opening vocal line in  'As the Years Go Passing By',(best known by Albert King). The lyrics that go with that riff: \\"-There is nothing I can do-....(if you leave me here to cry).\\"Whether this a coincidence or a decision, it adds another poignant dimension to this classic.DOMINOS MYSTERIES: 1/Drummer Jim Gordon wrote, and played -piano- on, the instrumental ending of Layla. His section's use was requested by  the producers after they 'caught' him recording it during off-time, in an attempt to make his own record.  For all of the fans who consider Clapton the world's greatest guitarist, keep in mind that MANY intelligent listeners felt that Gordon was the world's greatest drummer, and that Bobby Whitlock at the time was considered an even better singer than Eric, (although Eric's sound has aged better).  Carl Radle was a unique cross of Duck Dunn and Paul McCartney, rock-solid Memphis-style soul mixed with beautiful melodies, and of course, Duane. The best.
B0001Z52S4|3.0|This strange movie was almost impossible to decipher as to actual or fantasy life. We are led to believe the young twenty-year-old man is reliving his past in flashbacks -- at first. He'd apparently led such a troubled, neglected life in his childhood and growing-up years it had left him in a tramatized state of insanity.  This is filled with unknowns as actors (the only bright spot was Logan Lerman who reminded me of my son Zach at that age); it is so positively dark that Tim Burton or Justin Lin should have been the director. In fact, this is the American version of Better Luck Tomorrow.<br /><br />It is a movie of \\"what if's\\". There is no guarantee that life would be any better if we could change things. Yet, this boy uses some entries in journals covering thirteen years to try to rectify the wrongs which were done to him or he was involved in causing. Sometimes, it is reflective of the lowlife of society, with scenes in prison, college dorms, teenage pranks which exploded into criminal activity. It was always 'what if I had done this or that.'  At the Park theater there in Briarville, New York, we watch a movie within a movie -- very distracting, as was that infernal necklace he wore throughout the entire film. His computer in the dorm room is never turned on, so why'd he have one? He's always hoarding the composition books he calls journals. But does he really have journals. That's the big question.<br /><br />Those were weird characters in the bar. He always seemed to attract strange roommates (in prison it was a religious freak as his cell mate). The prison scene was a nightmare. The macabre ending in his dreams echoed his dreaming about all the bad things he'd experienced and how he'd go about changing them in several dream fantasies. Guess that's where the 'butterfly effect' came in -- flitting from one strange incidence to another.  It was hard to decided whether he was on the brink of insanity or completely around the bend like his father who had died at Sunnyvale Mental Institution. Had he inherited his 'father's curse'? There was some fleeting nudity in the shower scene and plenty of crude language.<br /><br />No matter what life holds for a human, there is no going back -- no perfect life. In his warped mind, he returns to his past to redeem the hurts perpetrated on him. He discovers that mental illness is worse than death.  This was a very disturbing movie and not pleasant to watch.  For a similar flick, watch 'Secret Window.'ed at Sunnyvale Mental Institution. Had he inherited his 'father's curse'?

B00000AFWZ|3.0|I loved the &quot;Loud &amp; Fast&quot; collection and have been listening to &quot;No Thanks&quot; over and over again ever since it's been released . Since I'm also a huge fan of what is actually known as Garage Rock , i.e. bands such as The Strokes , The Libertines or The White Stripes , I could have never imagine I'd be disapointed by those Nuggets .<br />The problem is actually quite simple : 80% of the songs collected here are forgetable and amateurish ; 10% could have barely been Stones or Beatles b-sides ; and 10% are huge hits , but you already own half of them .<br />Let us be honnest for a second : those songs were all meant to hit the mainstream radio , but they suck so much they just couldn't make it . If you love those songs because you think they are &quot;interesting&quot; , you get it all wrong . They were all written by young teenagers with no talent at all ; Those kids had never heard anything else but what was on the radio and could only ape the Stones to make something good . I wanted to burn a CD with my favorite Nuggets on it , but couldn't even fill more than 30 minutes of music . I thought it was not worth wasting a CD and sold the boxset the following day .<br />In my humble opinion however , everyone should take a look at those Nuggets to see what music was like in the 60s beside The Stones , The Beatles , The Byrds , The Doors , Cream etc etc ...<br />I would have actually been really excited to get this box as a birthday or christmas present . But if you can't borrow it to a friend , avoid buying it . It's really not worth it .
B000083C49|4.0|The premise of &quot;Star Trek: The Voyage Home&quot; probably doesn't sound promising to those who haven't seen it- the Enterprise and the crew travel back to the present day to retrieve a pair of humpback whales.  It's a welcome surprise then that &quot;The Voyage Home&quot; proves to be one of the most entertaining Star Trek entries; it's both interesting and funny, if a little low on tension.<br />Director Leonard Nimoy handles this situation perfectly.  The &quot;fish-out-of-water&quot; story had grown old even when this movie was released in 1986, but it's still a riot to watch the Enterprise crew try to adapt to late 20th century San Francisco.  There's also a good ecological message from &quot;The Voyage Home&quot;- if man continues to be short-sighted in his dealings with the environment, he may inadvertently destroy himself.  There's not many major characters in the film outside of the Enterprise crew, but Catherine Hicks shows flair as a marine biologist that's trying to help out Kirk and Co.<br />The only thing that's missing from &quot;The Voyage Home&quot; is tension.  There's no real villain and never really a sense that things won't turn out all right in the end.  One could argue that the series needed to lighten up a bit after the dark and violent second and third entries, but it still sometimes feel that something's missing from &quot;The Voyage Home&quot;.<br />Overall, this is a very entertaining movie, and one of the few &quot;Star Trek&quot; films that can appeal to a wide audience outside of its target one.  Considering the quality of some of the &quot;Star Trek&quot; films that followed it (&quot;The Final Frontier&quot;, &quot;Generations&quot;), &quot;The Voyage Home&quot; is definetely a quality Trek outing.  If you don't own it yet, what are you waiting for?
B0000AUHOH|4.0|THIS IS THE WORST STAR TREK MOVIE I keep reading on Amazon.  It should have been this, it could have been that . . . . I ask you here and now, is all that really so important?  This is a film, which unless I'm missing something here, that was designed for entertainment.  Yes, ENTERTAINMENT.  Does not Science Fiction demand the suspension of standard beliefs that it may be accepted?  One reviewer is hung up on how little time it takes for the crew of the Enterprise to reach the center of the galaxy, yet generously accepts the functions of the transporter, sythetic gravity and proof of alien races who speak fluent english.  What???  Continually, I've read how people tear this and other films apart upon this difficulty or that bit of confusion . . . <br />Oh, it's not a bad film.  It's ENTERTAINMENT, that's all; and I write to you that this is an ENTERTAINING film. Who cares what William Shatner thinks of himself??  Speaking only for myself, such petty matters prove too taxing to allow for the enjoyment of it all.  This film approaches the subject of God, and determines that we cannot define Him.  Is that really so tough to accept?  If that can be accepted, then why can't the many so-called \\"flaws\\" of this film be accepted?  After all, I've seen many, many films of less value; films which certainly weren't ENTERTAINING.  <br />Good people, to get hung up on the kind petty details I'm reading here by others submitting their reviews is to rob oneself of the pleasure of the viewing experience, in my humble opinion.  Let it all go, suspend belief as Science Fiction requires and have a good time. <br />By the way, the man who played Sybok, Spock's half-brother bad guy/good-guy antagonist who is determined to fulfull his visions to find God, did an exceptionally fine job - both underrated and overlooked.  Put simply, I found his acting superior to the seasoned cast.  <br />If it's such a lousy film which deserves so much criticism, then let someone else go out there and produce a different version.  Until then, I still enjoy this film because it ENTERTAINS me, not because it satisfies a dememted need for perfectionism.<br />So enjoy it for what it is and leave it at that.  After all, I never believed for a moment that I was to save my soul through watching this film.  Whether one believes in God or not is hardly the issue here; for the character of man remains forever flawed when measured against, at the very least, the theology of God to the unbeliever, and the reality of God to the believer.  As man is therefore not perfect as God is, how is it that the public is demaning this perfectionism from Hollywood?  People, including me, make mistakes.  BIG DEAL.  There are so very many other movies out there which simply do not match the caliber of this one, flawed or not.<br />Yea though, the decision is thine own . . . Have a nice day.
B000002LGQ|5.0|As usual Madonna made a genius CD here. One of her best, especially the title track. The last track, Act Of Contrition, is genius as well - it pokes fun at religion, which I think is hillarioud. I'm a total atheist but I love this CD.<br />It also proves how BOLD Madonna is. The woman is fearless, and amazing. She is one of the few people with the guts to openly speak about the horrors of organized religion, and we need more people like that. Amazing CD.
B000002JSR|5.0|OK so Led Zeppelin were broken up in 1982 when CODA was released and Atlantic or Mr. Page wished to capitalise on the public's appetite for more Zeppelin. Today Zeppelin is still broken up and despite numerous financial successes at re-releases and compliations including the ultra-amazing \\"How the West was won\\" Live CD and DVD, they are still part of the past. <br />This is the point of CODA, its a retrospective spanning their career with some of the unfriendliest moments in music if youre a Zeppelin fan. Still CODA isnt as unlistenable as In Through the Out Door, which posts the poorest outing the foursome have ever crafted...ending the story on a bad note such as that 1979 release was simply too much for the band and the fans to bear.<br />In Through the Out Door was recorded, \\"mainly in the dark, in Sweden.\\" Plant's son had died and he was in utter torment. Page could barely hold his axe and certainly could no longer wield it with the expertise he once did. The relationship among band members was becoming increasingly frayed. JP Jones and Plant picked up the pieces and tried to move on, they failed, but to their credit put out a proud Led Zeppelin effort (and in the process helped invent New Wave).<br />This brings us to CODA, its the long tearful goodbye to a band that was and is a legend. When I look at bands like the Rolling Stones and how their tours make zillions of dollars, yet they have acomlished NOTHING musically in the past 25 years, they simply live on past achievements when the band and the sexed up ideology should have been put to rest ages ago, how truly sad. CODA puts Zeppelin to rest with dignity the rauchy-blues infused rock weve come to expect from Zoso and Co.<br />Will Zeppelin do a reunion tour? Who can say...well I can say thats impossible, with Bonzos death so too did Zeppelin die. Any regrouping would be something new, and I know this because I've read the final chapter called CODA.
B00008EY9G|1.0|This movie a joke. It is an insult to any viewer's intelligence. The shocking secret is so blaringly obvious, it's beyond stupid. The ending of the movie is a total ripoff.

B00005JMJ4|5.0|If you \\"get\\" this movie, it is five stars all the way.  If you don't \\"get\\" this movie that doesn't make it worth only one star.  There is much in life that I don't like or \\"get.\\"  Just because I don't \\"get\\" it does not necessarily detract from the merit of that given thing.  This movie is a work of art for what it is.  If you are expecting Caddy Shack, Meatballs or a conventional love story you will be disappointed.  If you were expecting something else, you should have gone to see something else.  As for the soundtrack, I found it absolutely wonderful, which like every other element of this film, people seemed to either love or hate.  If you are looking for the literal or familiar, please avoid this movie.  If however, you see yourself as a person willing to experience something that goes beyond comforting cliches, you will see one of the few times where the phrase, \\"the art of movie making\\" is true and not an oxymoron.  And remember, \\"For fun times, it's Suntory times.\\"

B00005JKCH|5.0|As an old fan of the comic book for 15 years, I was eagerly awaiting the release of this film.  Sam Raimi did not dissapoint and it has since become one of my favorite movies.  Not only is it one of my favorite movies, but it's also one of my favorite DVDs.  in typical Marvel style, this DVD is loaded with extra features that are just as entertaining as the film.<br />The DVD features two excellent audio commentarys.  the first is by director Raimi, Producer Curtis, Actress Dunst, and producer Ziskin.  While a lot of DVD commentaries can get kind of confusing with 4 people talking, this commentary is actually split up, as Dunst and Ziskin recorded theirs at a seperate time than Raimi and Curtis.  The audio will switch back and forth between the two depending on who had the most interesting comment about a scene. I actually watched the film with the commentary immediately after watching the movie, something which I can never usually do because I get bored too easily.<br />The second commentary is by the visual effects team.  I wasn't as entertained with this one but it is fairly interesting to hear their stories about what went on with the stunt work and some of the scenes.<br />Two music videos are included, as well as HBO and E! \\"Making-Of\\" featurettes.  One of my favorite DVD extras are the screen tests with Toby Maguire and J.K. Simmons (JJ Jameson).  These are always a lot of fun to watch.  The DVD is further fleshed out by a short outttake reel and trailers.<br />Then Marvel comes in, and includes all kinds of comic-book extras that explore the history of Spider-Man in the comics, Peter Parker's girlfriends, some common Spider-Man enemies, and an excellent comic book archive.<br />Even with all of that, there are still features I haven't mentioned, like a \\"Spider-Sense\\" navigational feature that lets you click on an icon at certain points in the film. This brings up mini featurettes that explore things like how a production set was designed or an interview with the \\"Spider-Wrangler.\\"<br />This is a fantastic film, and an even better DVD that has just enough information and fatures for the most hard core Spider-Man fans.

B000060K4O|5.0|Fantastic DVD with lots, and lots of extra's. The film has been amazingly restored, looks like a film made this year! The special effects are orignal of course, not re-done, but pretty good for a 1984 movie, It was made 20 years ago, so the effects are excellent for it. If you have not seen this movie....you must have been born after 1995, because, everyone knows it. It's one of those rare movies, that litterally becomes a part of culture... Who ya' gonna call? brings an instant flashback to the ghostbuster for anyone over 10. Like &quot;It's A Wonderfull Life&quot;, it will be around forever, which has been been around since the 40's. A must buy, well worth it. Including Deleted Scenes.
B0000DD7LB|5.0|anyone that was annoyed by the previous super-sugary pop songs should definately give this album a shot. dont buy it for your 5 year old niece because of its quasi-adult nature, but i'm a 22 year old woman who LOVES IT and will proudly admit im a britney fan. all the songs are tight, and though shes not the best singer, shes an ENTERTAINER... she does the whole thing and she does it extremely well. <BR>i love every song, especially the new single 'toxic' (thought i dont think it has anything to do with justin timberlake... when i heard it, it reminded me of colin farrel [and 'the recruit', honestly... wasnt she dating him around the time that he filmed that?]). <BR>all skeptics who hate pop but love dance/r&b, give the cd a chance.... its a little trashy but thats what makes it so fun. this woman was going through personal changes that everyone has, her parents divorce, media backlash about everything she did, and hearing her first love trash her for all the world to hear. she has every right to say what shes saying! i went through a hard break up after a 3-year relationship too, and i went through the 'crazy' party and dating phase too.... i understand every word shes saying and love her even more for it! rock on, britney! :-)
B00005JMTN|4.0|Tim Burton's most anticipated movie has finally arrived.  Fans from all over have flocked to go see this movie when it was only released in limited theaters.  But now, it's open nation wide and everyone can have a chance to see this movie.  But is it worth the wait...and the cost of your money?<br />Albert Finney plays Ed Bloom; a man who has spent most of his whole life telling stories to everyone he meets.  Everyone seems to get a big kick out of the stories except for his son, Will Bloom (Billy Crudup).  Ed becomes very sick and this illness causes Will to come back to his father.  Will then struggles with his father to seperate fact from fiction and find out who his father really is.  The movie is told mostly through Ed's stories and Ewan McGregor plays the young Ed Bloom.  Jessica Lange stars as Ed's wife, Sandra Bloom, while Alison Lohman plays the young Sandra Bloom throughout the stories.<br />After seeing this movie, I was just in awe at how incredible this film was.  The movie is very emotional and definitely not for everyone.  Big Fish starts out kinda confusing and almost a mess.  The movie starts right away in the stories and your swept into them with no plot and wonder, \\"What's going on?\\"  The one reason why the movie still has audiences watching and not leaving, despite the flaws, is because of the visuals.  It's a good thing Tim Burton directed because to be honest, I don't think any other director could pour enough imagination and heart into this movie like Tim Burton did.  Through the visuals, one can see that Mr. Burton cares deeply for this movie and it's characters.  The visuals can go from being creepy (very much Burton style), to being simply beautiful.  The movie has excelled in it's breath taking appearance.<br />The acting is so-so except for two that stand out among the others.  Mr Finney is extraordinary as the father who is relentless in telling his stories.  This is a difficult character to play because this is a man who likes to be thecenter of attention but yet he has to be a character that you still care for even though he is selfish in his ways.  Mr. Finney hits the character right on, and you find yourself loving Ed Bloom and always wanting him to be on the screen, much like the other characters wanted him in the film because of his stories.  The other standout is Mr. Crudup.  His performance of the son who can't stand his father or his stories is so human that you feel like you know this guy.  Mr. Crudup is very careful in his acting in making sure he doesn't overact during the emotional scenes but yet, stay human and provide us with warm comfort as we can understand and relate to why he would feel sick of his father and his stories.<br />Big Fish consist mostly of Ed's stories and at the final ending is where everything comes together.  Throughout the entire movie there's not much of a plot, but it keeps you there because of the visuals, and then at the end is where everything comes together.  The ending is so pleasing and glamourous that it makes the entire movie worthwhile.  The ending is what truely turns this film from a good movie into a great movie.  It's so charitable and memorable of the importance of a father/son relationship that it had me crying.  Everything was tied together and I found myself cheering and clapping at how incredible this film was.  <br />Big Fish is definielty worth the money.  This is a film about a father and a son and the relationship between the two.  Though the movie begins like a man stumbling through the fog, it ends like a man standing in a field of beautifully grown yellow flowers, simply marvolous.  Big Fish has produced an emotionally big result.

0767805712|5.0|As a script writer and student of film, I know how hard it is to convey a futuristic storyline believably and have it contain touches of suspense, humor, romance, and humanity and have it ALL work.  &quot;Gattaca&quot; is a story about flawed people who have great spirits, yet &quot;Gattaca&quot; itself is as unflawed as any science fiction film ever made.  Every scene cleverly pushes the story along and twists many different ideas and possibilities together like a perfect length of rope.  <BR>              The visuals of Gattaca are breathtaking and capture the time of the story in a way that is futuristic but comparable to present day.  The acting is perfect for the story and it will touch you from the very opening scene.  As far as science fiction stories go, this is as good as any, EVER.  If you don't see Gattaca, you've missed out.  Also accompanied by a wonderful score.  Simply brilliant.  Buy it, because if you rent it, you'll wind up buying it anyway.
0609610570|4.0|Execution is a fresh of breath air, especially after reading so many business books about 'vision', where the entire book is all 'vision' and no 'substance'. The two authors of the book do know something about creating realistic plans, linking actual operational considerations with goals for achievement, and getting down to a real rubber-meets-the-road approach to planning. In fact, the later chapters about creating strategic plans and tying those plans to the operating plan and budget in a realistic manner are, in my opinion, by far the best the book has to offer, and make the book well worth the read. <br />Where I wish they had broadened the scope of the book is to cover effective execution at lower layers of the corporate hierarchy - almost the entire book takes place at, and really applies to, the CEO/EVP/VP level of fortune 500 companies. It rarely if ever covers strategies that work for managers of smaller busines units or groups, or who work in smaller companies. In both cases, the strategies in this book, while still being valuable as theory, lose their practical value. It becomes clear as you read the book that the authors have no real experience with those levels/companies, and I think the book suffers for it. <br />Overall, I think this book is worth the read, but I can't bring myself to give it five stars.
B0000DD7LB|5.0|I have to admit I wasn't always a fan of Miss Spears. Most of her earlier music wasn't my style but I always respected her composure when dealing with the media and her countless critics. She is one of the few pop stars that has never resorted to cheap shots and insults directed towards her so called 'rivals'. Britney always kept her cool, dealing with the intrusive press with more class and composure than most. That is part of the reason that I decided to give her music another chance. And I was surprised and amazed :-) In the Zone is a great CD - to dance the night away that is...Britney steers clear from sugary ballads (thankfully) and focuses on a more grown up dance/techno style (think early Madonna), managing to pull off more than just a few stellar singles. My favorite include: I Got That Boom Boom (featuring Ying Yang Twins), Toxic, The Hook Up, Early Morning and Brave New Girl. Once it is in your 'boom box' you can dance pretty much through the entire album...and the only slow song 'Everytime' is a perfect way to finish the CD and it really shows off Britney's voice (she can really sing!!!). Bottom line - this CD is worth buying and it just might change your mind about Miss Spears...
B00005A46T|1.0|i never bought this cd, mostly because my friend brought it over to my house and told me i had to listen and i was disgusted. i've been told these guys have some great drumming. i was not really impressed. they have what, 3 drummers? if you want som nice heavy drumming, listen to chimaira. and they don't need 3 drummers to make it sound huge.
B000003TA4|5.0|dude this cd is great. theres really not a bad song on this. its just awesome man. i think it woulda been awesome if Cobain was still here man
0345440900|5.0|It's too bad that many people are unhappy about how this book handles the issue of breastfeeding vs. bottle.  As far as I'm concerned the bottom line is that this book was tremendously helpful in making me understand how to deal in everyday life with an infant.  I found the methods easy to implement.  I give this book as a gift to my friends. My husband,  who is a family doctor, recommends the book to his new parents who ask for his help how to care for and understand their babies.
B0000DJZA5|1.0|I realize this is a tangential matter at most, and I expect to be excoriated for bringing it up, but I just don't care. (So there!) Two reviewers so far have complained about what we'd might as well call sir-sycophancy. Sir-sycophancy aside, if we're (well, actually, if THEY'RE) going to go about knighting British pop stars (presumably because we've, I mean they've, run out of un-knighted British actors), it is imperative that we immediately knight Gary Brooker of Procol Harum. Why? If you're familiar with the Avengers (sixties British television series, later episodes of which were aired both in England and the United States), you'll remember that protagonists John Steed and Emma Peel were frequently off to meet Sir somebody-or-other. That Sir somebody-or-other (or the actor who portrayed him, rather) frequently looked and comported himself very like Gary Brooker of Procol Harum. Is that really sufficient reason to knight Gary Brooker? If his &quot;services to music&quot; are sufficient reason to knight Mick Jagger, then, yes, in my opinion it is--or if it isn't, then let's send Mick Jagger off to the Crusades and let's have Elton John and Paul McCartney joust (yes, to the death). <br />Oh, about Naked: If you're gullible enough to believe the hype, you deserve it. Lucky you, eh?
B000092ZYX|4.0|I'm at the CD store checking out CD's.  But, it all just sounded the same.  Then I check out Radiohead's latest &quot;Hail to the Thief&quot;.  How refreshing.  Here's a band that isn't afraid to try new things.  Admittedly, this album is not going to appeal to all you mainstreamers out there, but if you're looking for something new and different than this is a good album to check out.  <br />This album has a strange, dark tone to it and is the reason I'm in love with it.  The album makes use of various electronic sounds, piano, guitar and Thom Yorke's cryptic vocals.  I tell you it's a strange CD and in this case strange is good, very good.<br />The opening track &quot;2+2=5&quot;'s beginning makes you feel like you're in some strange foreign land before picking up the pace later on and ending with some catchy guitar playing.<br />&quot;Sail to the Moon&quot; (song #3) is beautiful sounding with it's blend of piano and electronic sounds.  It is also strange at times.<br />&quot;Go to Sleep&quot; (#5) is a very nice acoustic guitar song and is the most normal sounding song on the album. It's catchy.<br />&quot;Where I End and You Begin&quot; (#6) definitely is 'out there'.  There is no way for me to classify it, but I do like it none the less.<br />I like all but four of the albums fourteen tracks and that ain't bad.  <br />Basically, you're either gonna love this CD or hate it.  The fact that it sounds strange will either turn you on or off.  It definetly works on me so I recommend checking it out.
0156027321|5.0|I loved how the author was able to write about little tiny indian jokes that one wouldn't understand unless one was from south east asia. I had a tough time putting this book down because it was funny and painful at the sametime. <br />I defintely recommended this book.
B00009V8Z9|5.0|Chariot is one of the best cd's out right now. Every song is unique and they all sound so great. I highly recommend this cd to anyone who is thinking about buying it.
B0000024K1|5.0|Other people have elequently stated this album's powerful lyrics and amazing musical creativity.  All I can say is that after 15 years, it is still one of the best albums I own or have heard.
B0000042MY|5.0|This is one of those CDs that really deserves 5 stars - it has variety, artistry, and a sort of odd progression to it that makes it good for studying, the car, doing dishes, etc.  The best thing about this soundtrack is that it stands alone musically, and doesn't require the movie to help it make musical sense, something many soundtracks (such as, pardon me, Braveheart) ultimately fail to do, and also provides an amazing variety.  Listening to this CD is like going on a journey every time.  It sounds like a beautiful story.<br />A lot of reveiewers are talking about the movie - I only saw it once a long time ago, and didn't think it was that great - I'll just talk about the music.  The bizarre pairing of Randy Edelman and Trevor Jones is one that works out very well.  The beginning of the CD is fused with more energetic pieces, music that sounds like someone is running around outside in the forest.  Then it switches to a mood like everyone is packing for a journey and starting out.  Then stopping for water.  Then etc.  Eventually it goes through multiple transformations and the last tracks wind up as some of the most haunting, moving, and peacefully disturbing score pieces around.  And then it ends with the perfect chord that sums up the trip, and makes you want to start it over. <br />This CD is my favorite soundtrack, and I don't say that lightly.  It has been for the last 8 years, despite all the good stuff Hans Zimmer's been putting out.  <br />Give it a try!  You won't be disappointed if you're in the mood for a quality composition that tells a tale of it's own.
B0000DZ3EA|5.0|some reviewers have mentioned that this is a disappointing CD, but remember that greatest hits CDs are typically lost on the fans who have collected everything by that artist. i've always like peter gabriel, but never bought one of his CDs, so this &quot;best of&quot; was perfect for me. there may be other songs that are excellent (and i will now delve further), but these 2 CDs aptly collect all the songs that i have liked and wanted to have. if you've heard peter gabriel's work (who hasn't?) and never wanted to lash out on a whole CD, then this was made for you. also, i can understand now why he has such a loyal following - most of these songs are truly brilliant.
B0000BYM3K|1.0|I just bought the new Maiden CD &quot;Dance of Death&quot;. I was a bit hesitant to buy it, but gave it a shot. Well, I am extremely disappointed in their latest effort. I am 33 and have been a Maiden fan since I was 12. I loved everything from the first self entitled Maiden up through Somewhere in Time, (the 7th sign is weak). I even gave No Prayer a chance, it was good except Bring your daughter to the slaughter was crap. Like all Maiden fans I was ecstatic about the semi-original lineup getting together to put out Brave New World. It was pretty good, but nothing to freak out about. But the new CD &quot;Dance of Death&quot; is their worst effort possible. Weak song writting is the problem. The music is not too bad, but the songs are about what? And they all sound the same. Maiden is about heavy music with a heavy message. It's not supposed to be nice. When thet lost their dark edge, they lost me. Sorry fellow Maiden fans, but somebody had to say it, &quot;THIS ALBUM STINKS&quot;!!!

B0000CEB4V|5.0|I freely admit that I wept for much of the latter part of the video, having been profoundly moved by Ravi Shankar's words about his deeply spiritual friend.  It had been a joyous celebration, but then it became something much more.  The musicians are highly professional and not the least bit mawkish, but clearly intend - and succeed - in honoring their friend's great humanity along with his music.  Songs are not played note for note, nor even always in the same tempo or time signature as the original, but the interpretations tend to be right on.<br />Appreciate it at whatever level suits you, but do let the love fill your heart and soul.
B0000DIXN7|4.0|As with many others I came across this by accident when a friend requested it for Xmas and of course, I had a listen before wrapping it! I have only just listened to it and love it. There are quite a few songs on this CD which if you are a single woman under 30, you will be able to relate to or will know someone who can.<br />Definately worth a listen....
B000067J1Q|5.0|I was introduced to The Sound of Music by my dad when i was a young girl and loved it from the very beginning. Now that i'm older, however, i appreciate the movie even more and thankful that my dad introduced me to this great classic musical. The plot is amazing, the music is timeless, and the actors are superb. It also helps that the visuals in the movie are breathtaking. I love the plot also. The sound of music is easily one of my favorite things!
0385504209|5.0|It manages to explain the meanings behind so many things in our culture and life and completely rewrite the christian religion in the process.  It's just amazing.  He's taken essentially a massive amount of historical research and groundbreaking revelations and wrapped it around a very fast moving and exciting 'fictional' plot which keeps you going for more.  I read the book in two days I was so amazed by it.  The author is a genious.
B00005YW4H|5.0|I have read the bad reviews for this CD and frankly, I'm shocked! What were these people thinking? Were they having a bad day when they listened to Norah? I think this CD is better than ANY out there. I listen to it constantly, never get bored! They call this music superficial, but I think they are the ones who are really superficial and can't relize the powerful depth of talent and music in her songs. Ok, so she didn't write most of her songs! Who cares? Most of the people out there don't write the songs... in ANY genre. But boy, the songs she did write, WOW! They're even better than the rest. The bad reviews this CD got cannot overcome the wonderful reviews. So you people who've not listened to her, please give her a chance.... you'll fall in love with the Bluegrass Jazz Norah delivers!!!!!
B000001IPL|5.0|Well, this is \\"THE OFFSPRING ALBUM\\" that I suggest everyone to buy. It is a fast, catchy and funny album different from the Americana or Conspiracy of one albums (the last splinter is good by the way!) All the Offspring classics are on it, songs like Gotta get away, bad habit, come out and play, self-esteem, genocide, smash are all awesome! Definetely this is a classic!
B0000024K1|5.0|Many say that this is the best rap album ever made.  I agree, but that's still selling it short.  The truth is, this is one of the best albums ever made in any genre.  The combination of intelligent, poetic lyrics with driving beats and layering of sounds continues to be hugely influential both within and outside of hip hop.  <br />This album, along with The Clash's 'London Calling,' proves that it is possible to combine political conviction and artistic achievement to create innovative work.  Public Enemy raised the bar for popular music in general - unfortunately far too few artists even try for it anymore.

0385507755|5.0|James Frey's writing style is very creative and reflects the state of his addiction.  It really opens your eyes to the world of the addicted and causes you to think if you ever could become that way.  This was definitely a page turner that I could not put down.

0312954468|1.0|River Guru!<br />Taita the super slave as one reviewer put it, is so correct.  His one failing-no equipment but no mind he can do anything else. This Guru invents everything from microbiological warfare to military strategy to complex engineering marvels. But wait! he is a doctor too and an adviser and a lawyer and a prophet. Perfect Taita. By the way, he doesn't want to be free! He likes being a slave! <BR>Hmmm...<br />This one person shaped the destiny of an entire country. Really now! The only thing more off putting was the constant adulterous relationships. If you like soap operas or slavery then this will certainly impress you. For others it will be a waste of time.
B0000TB050|5.0|If you are looking for a dvd that contains 20 songs you can´t skip, excellent sound, natural picture/video takes, if you want to get into the soul of one of the best singers ever when you see him dealing with mixed and very intense feelings like losing your father and playing in front of your people for the first time in 20 years, and if you want to understand why U2 fans love U2 so much and why a U2 concert is almost like being in heaven, then you don't hesitate and buy this DVD.<BR>Since i saw U2 playing their last concert in Miami on december 02, 2001, my soul has been missing the feeling of joy and happiness that i felt after they closed their tour with an unbelievable version of Walk On.<BR>Here i am, 2 years later,having found this DVD and suddenly all of the joy, all the adrenaline and all of the happiness come alive once again!<br />The 5.1 Dolby Digital Sound:<BR>Amazing. Bono's voice sounds clear and passionate all allong the concert. Great drum and guitar sound. Adam Clayton's bass is not so prominent like in the Boston DVD but still great.<br />DTS Sound:<BR>Too much noise coming from the rear speakers. DTS is not a reason to buy this DVD.    <br />The songs:<BR>Out of Control their first single and an excuse to thank each band member's family for giving them 500 pounds/each to close their first record deal in London, Sunday Bloody Sunday (the best version ever and maybe the most passionated performance i have ever seen from any singer), Wake up Dead Man, Kite (Bono almost comes to tears while remembering his dead father),All i want is you (dedicated to his wife......also devotion to his wife in the middle of a great concert),and One are the key reasons to buy this DVD. <BR>Rage, pain, joy, love, passion...any known or unknown emotion.... you can feel them while tasting those excellent pieces of music.<br />The Video:<BR>Really good video for not being planned to be put on DVD. The takes are natural and capture completely the escense of the interactionand love between U2 and their fans. The lack of preparation allowed the director to capture unique reactions and colors and textures you can only see when you are in the arena with them.<br />The Crowd:<BR>Amazing. Very involved with Bono and all the rest of the Band.<br />U2:<BR>Maybe the best song selection for a band with more than 50 hit songs, a frontman singing deep from his heart, unlimited interaction with the crowd, smiles and jokes surrounding the typical mistakes a music player can make (like Edge missing a chord in Staring at the sun or Adam Clayton missing to start on time in Angel of Harlem). You can't ask for more...<br />You don't need to be a U2 fan to love this concert. If you are a human being looking for joy, for good music, excellent tunes, if you are looking forward to experience something different and fulfilling, then this DVD is the right choice.

B000002KZA|3.0|This was my favorite Depeche Mode album for a long time.  But like a lot of earlier Depeche Mode, I just don't think this holds up anymore.  It's not the timeless pop classic that Violator is, and doesn't have the sophistication of Songs of Faith and Devotion. Pretty much everything before Music for the Masses is just hard to appreciate now except in a historical sense.<br />If you're exploring the early years of Depeche Mode, or trying to round out the collection, it's a worthwhile buy.  If you are new to DM and are looking for just any DM to buy, first get Violator and SOFAD if you don't already have them.
B0000CEB4V|5.0|\\"The Concert for Gerorge\\" was an unexpected surprise treasure of a Christmas gift. I did not sit down to watch until New year's Eve and the soft tribute to the music of George Harrison was just what the old year needed for a sentimental sendoff. I knew before viewing that the band was great, but would all those super musicians and session folk step all over themselves as in so many concerts on this scale of talent? Answer: not in the least. I cannot think of a song gone bad during the entire production; however I found the Monty Python part to be tedious, even given their connection to George. Ringo was Ringo and Paul was Paul, but Dhani Harrison's remarkable resemblence to his father kept making me think that life and legacy do go on. Eric Clapton in this politically correct world is no longer \\"god\\", but he is a musical angel. Another highlight was Jeff Lynne's uncanny capture of the also late Roy Orbison's chorus on \\"Handle With Care.\\" Lynne also did an amazingly fine vocal and guital job with \\"The Inner Light\\"; accompanied by Ravi Shankar's gorgeous and talented daughter, Anoushka. Jools Holland sang the heck and almost her ... out of her blouse in \\"Horse to Water.\\" I thought, however, the piece de resistence was Billy Preston's rendition of \\"My Sweet Lord.\\" More than any other song or tribute, this piece of the concert connected me personally with the spirit of George. George Harrison was very much the soul of the Beatles and that  great soul is still a life force here in the material world he left behind.
B00005JMJ4|5.0|Simply said, you either get it or you don't. If you don't, then certainly I can understand someone saying its not a great movie. But if you are of the mind to understand what the movie is all about, then you will find that it is one of the most charming movies to come out in a long time. It will stay with you and you will want to see it again and again. wonderful.<br /> Thanks Mugino for bringing me to this movie!
B00009Y2K9|5.0|Lágrimas Negras is the title of a song written by Cuban composer Miguel Matamoros in the 1930s. It says: \\"Aunque tú me has dejado en el abandono/aunque tú has muerto todas mis ilusiones (Although you have abandoned me/Although you have killed all of my hopes...\\"). It is also the title track of this new album by Cuban pianist Bebo Valdés (born in 1918) and Spanish flamenco cantaor Diego el Cigala (born in 1960). These two men though born 50 years apart, and two worlds away from each other, have recorded nine passionate songs on a beautiful album. It was as emotive to listen to as it was to hear John Coltrane for the first time. Or, Vinicius de Moraes for the first time. Or Roberto el Polaco Goyeneche for the first time.<br />This original pairing between Bebo Valdés and el Cigala is sublime. The songs are all standards, but the arrangements are not. Each song features Valdes' smooth jazzy piano melodies and el Cigala's guttural, passionate vocals. To appreciate the entire album's sophisticated textures, it can be listened to in absolute darkness so all of one's senses can focus on its velvety and harsh beauty.
B00005QDW1|4.0|When I first heard this album, I absolutely hated it. I wrote a particularly negative review here on amazon noting my hate for it, but without really offering much of a reason aside from the fact that it doesn't sound like No Doubt's older albums. Time has since passed. I've listened to this album more, and I don't believe that review was fair.  <br /> <br />My main gripe was that this was such a sheer pop album, the kind of thing I almost felt embarressed to listen to. And I hadn't felt that way about \\"Tragic Kingdom\\" or \\"Return of Saturn.\\" The lyrics also were a lot less mature than the lyrics on \\"Return of Saturn.\\" These were legitimate grips to an extent, but there are also a lot of good things about this album that I overlooked entirely. <br /> <br />A few years older now, I don't worry about avoiding something simply because it is poppy. Poppy can even be good, if it is done right. The problem is: so much pop music is poorly done. But No Doubt is still a band, and there is some interesting instrumentation on this album. You just have to listen with an open mind. Yes, songs like \\"Hella Good\\" and \\"Hey Baby\\" were obviously written in an attempt to appeal to a younger audience, and the lyrics are nowhere near deep. But after two solo albums, I'm definitely over the fact that Gwen has sold out a bit. At least her take on pop is vastly more interesting than Britney's. <br /> <br />Another plus with this album is that you can easily listen to the entire thing. It's not as good as \\"Tragic Kingdom,\\" which is a classic in my book and managed to capture everything that was and is good about No Doubt, nor is it as mature as \\"Return of Saturn\\" in which Gwen seemed to be honestly baring her soul. But while I think that record is better written, it is also not as listenable due to the fact that it is a little too long. While it had no songs I flat-out dislike, I rarely wanted to listen to the entire thing. I can listen to all of this album.  <br /> <br />One final thing I have to note that bugs me a little is some of the guests No Doubt have included on this album. In recent years, Gwen seems to have decided it's a good idea to include guest vocalists in a few tracks. I definitely dislike that trend. Rappers often do that, but I've never really liked it. If I wanted to hear any of these artists (like Eve on Gwen's first solo disc), I would buy their discs. Still, this is a relatively minor complaint as you really only hear guest vocalists on a couple of tracks (\\"Hey Baby\\" and \\"Underneath It All\\"). <br /> <br />This album is good for what it is, but it's still pop music. Thus, it's not going to appeal to some people or even some No Doubt fans. Ska fans will would be well-advised to stick with No Doubt's early albums, and rock fans should pick up \\"Return of Saturn.\\" I think \\"Tragic Kingdom\\" is the best of No Doubt's albums because I think that one could appeal to almost everyone. It has elements of rock and ska, but also some very commercial singles like \\"Just a Girl\\" and \\"Don't Speak\\" that would appeal to newer No Doubt fans or Gwen's solo work (which thus far has been pretty uneven. Like I said, I'm over the fact that she's a pop star now but she should really avoid rapping....she's not a rapper). So, if you like your rock music a little (or a lot) on the poppy side, this album might just be for you. You may love it in fact. But if you're expecting something deeper or harder, just keep in mind you're not going to get that from this album.
0688163173|3.0|I first began reading the author Dennis Lehane several years ago when an online mystery reader highly recommended the first book in his Patrick Kenzie series,A Drink Before the War.  What began then was a series of books I looked forward to and titles which never failed to garner my highest praise.  Then Dennis Lehane wrote his first stand alone, Mystic River, and I wondered what he would do for a book encore after reading this book.  Unfortunately, after reading Shutter Island, I don't think that the author wrote as powerful or masterful a book this time as his previous titles.  While the author certainly set the gloomy scene of Shutter Island and the hospital, I found the first 100 pages tedious and never felt the plot, characters nor revelations by the end improved my opinion of this book. While readers are afforded a glimpse into the world of a former war hero who is now part of the FBI, the plot was far too predictable and reminiscent of a recent movie based on the true story of John Nash.<br />Teddy Daniels and Chuck Aule are summoned to Shutter Island where there is a hospital for the criminally insane to search for a woman murderer who has somehow vanished. A hospital situated on an island which can be reached only by ferry, it is surrounded by turbulent waters and there is little chance of anybody escaping and surviving.  Upon their arrival the two FBI agents are met with great resentment on the part of the staff.  And while these two men find clues to where the woman may be hiding in anagrams and other devices, the two men do find it unbelivable that anybody could just vanish from this facility with no trace.  While the men continue to be stalled in every direction, things are not what they appear to be.  During a violent storm certain truths are revealed which should surprise the reader and make them think this book was as terifiic a read as Mystic River ot Gone, Baby, Gone.  But by the macabre ending, though, I was less than surprised or shocked but instead was glad to see this book end.  I'm not sure why there was no AHA ending for me but instead sheer logic had me figuring out what was going on mid - way through the book and what happened to the missing woman.<br />I looked forward to this book with such great anticipation and obviously hoped for a much better and intersting read.  That said I know I will continue to read Dennis Lehane's future books.  Even now I am waiting patiently for his next title.ead was glad to see this book end.

0446677450|3.0|This is a fun book to read.  There is a lot of practical information and while most of it is common sense, it is presented in real life situations where it really jumps out at you.  However, the way the Rich Dad carried on about wage earners (his own employees) being stupid was just abnoxious after a while.  The idea that someone could actually enjoy their job is treated as unthinkable.  The reality that someone who knows how to live within their means and who knows how to use the money they saved, could actually work a regular job that they enjoy and retire early and wealthy - not within this guy's paradym.  Well I for one did and would not want to do it any other way.  If the Poor Dad had any financial sense, he could have too while still being the teacher that he wanted to be.  We don't all want to be rich jerks that look down on everyone else.
B0000399WI|5.0|We all know Shawshank is one of the best movies of all time, and many of the reviewers have well-described why, so I won't bother rehashing the movie.  <br />Rather, I would like to air my puzzlement and irritation with Castle Rock for not releasing the movie in a special DVD set filled with extras.  It seems that basically every_single_movie that comes out -- mostly garbage films no one has even seen in the theaters -- gets its own 2-DVD set.  Conversely, one of the most popular films of the last generation has been relegated to a limited, basically empty DVD version for nearly 10 years.  <br />Shame on the production company, and I plead with them to re-release Shawshank to give it the glory it is entitled to and give Shawshank's many fans a better product.
B0001CCXZW|5.0|No vampires to slay.  No kryptonite \\"Freaks of the Week.\\"  No friggin creeks that you wish the series' namesake to drown in.  Nothing but a well-written, wonderfully cast show that is long overdue for a DVD release.  When the first season DVD release hits shelves, the fourth season should be close to wrapping up on the WB, and hopefully will continue everything about the show that made the first episodes so enjoyable.<br />Set in a fictional Connecticut town called Stars Hollow, The Gilmore Girls follows the lives of Lorelai and Rory Gilmore, a a single mother and teenage daughter who share a bond that is as much best friends as it is that of a mother and child.  The series begins with Rory's acceptance into the prestigious Chilton Academy and Lorelai's frantic desire to make that happen, which much to her chagrin, involves the help of her own mother, Emily Gilmore (played by the excellent Kelly Bishop) and father Richard (Edward Herman).  Growing up the rebellious daughter of wealthy society types and becoming pregnant at age 16 didn't exactly endear them to each other.  It is Lorelai's relationship with her parents that drives much of her character's motivation.  <br />While life as a single mother might be hard, Lorelai is not without a support system.  Stars Hollow is populated with an impressive collection of colorful characters, from the gruff, flannel-wearing diner owner, Luke, to Lorelai's coworker and best friend Sookie and the annoying Frenchman, Michel.  <br />Rory, too, has a group of close friends and even closer enemies.  Lane Kim, daughter of a Korean Bible beater is the music obsessed best friend, Dean (Jared Padelecki) is her first boyfriend and Paris, her academic and social rival.  As is the case with basically anything on the WB, Chad Michael Murray also finds his way into her life, as do Madeline and Louise, Paris' oversexed friends and Chilton classmates. <br />Some of the highlight episodes from this debut season include Concert Interupticus -which featured a Bangles performance and hinted that there might be some degree of feeling beneath Paris' chilly exterior, and Emily in Wonderland - where Emily redecorates Rory's bedroom.  There are 20 more episodes, each with moments or more of genuine wit and even more genuine heart.<br />All of this considered, Lauren Graham and Alexis Bledel, as Lorelai and Rory, are the show's driving force.  Their chemistry, combined with the clever dialogue and rapid-fire delivery, have made this one of the best shows on tv. And now, at long last, on DVD!

B0001BKAEY|5.0|That is the worst possible cover art they could have chosen for this film. Talk about Lazy. Good thing the features are much more plentiful than in the matrix reloaded two disc set. But a box set is inevitable it seems so make your purchase decisions wisely.
B00000JLWW|4.0|Before I begin my review of &quot;Titanic,&quot; I feel the need to speak to those who have given this film one star reviews. First and foremost, I am both a film critic and an actor, so yes, I DO know better than you. Second, it makes you look stupid to hate any movie just because it wins Oscars and makes a lot of money. Third, 1998 is over, teenage girls aren't mindlessly obsessed with Leonardo Di Caprio anymore, and it is therefore no longer necessary to pretend to hate this movie. And finally (and most importantly), you have little to no understanding of what makes a great historical epic (which &quot;Titanic&quot; most certainly is). Strict adherence to the actual facts is not a priority; telling a great, compelling story is. (Imagine how incredibly boring &quot;Lawrence of Arabia&quot; would have been if it had told the story of T.E. Lawrence's actual life, instead of being based on an autobiography full of self-aggrandizing inaccuracies.) And in that regard, &quot;Titanic&quot; certainly succeeds.<br />The basic plot of &quot;Titanic&quot; is a fairly standard (yet no less entertaining) love story. Rose De Witt (Kate Winslet) is a wealthy Pennsylvania heiress returning from Europe with her mother (Frances Fisher) and fiance (Billy Zane) on the Titanic. There she meets Jack Dawson (Leonardo Di Caprio), a poor American who won his ticket in a card game moments before the ship set sail. After Jack saves Rose's life, the two quickly fall in love, and embark on a brief but passionate affair. Of course, their romance is destined for tragedy.<br />The storytelling of this movie is top-notch. The movie manages to take a plot which is inherently full of melodrama and make it very watchable. It's a fairly cliche rich-girl-meets-poor-boy romance, but because the two leads have such great chemistry, it seems new and fresh. The dialogue is, admittedly, fairly poor. But dialogue is the least important aspect of a film (a great screenplay can elevate a film, but a poor oneis rarely the sole, or even primary, factor behind a bad movie).<br />Much has been made of the poor acting in this film. The fact is, there are no acting coups in &quot;Titanic.&quot; But this is not an actor's movie. This one is all about the story and the spectacle, both of which it has in spades. Leonardo Di Caprio doesn't do a BAD job as Jack; he just isn't especially believable. Kate Winslet, one of the best actresses working in films today, does some of the weakest work of her career but is always watchable, and the rest of the cast acquits themselves well. (How Winslet earned a Best Actress Oscar nomination is beyond me; Gloria Stuart's Best Supporting Actress nod undoubtedly came about because the Academy loves elderly veterans who make &quot;comebacks.&quot;)<br />The main reason to watch this movie is for the special effects. But the people who have called this movie &quot;all effects and no plot&quot; (aside from demonstrating a complete lack of understanding as to what &quot;plot&quot; is) speak as though they're watching the run-of-the-mill explosions of a Bruckheimer action film. The visual effects in action films are not impressive; those in &quot;Titanic&quot; are. It's as though James Cameron (who I normally despise, but deserves every bit of acclaim he got for this film) built an entirely new Titanic just to sink it. A lot of movies have special effects that are impressive in theory, but don't excite anyone. In this film, the Titanic looks REAL. (The scenes of the sinking ship, particularly the harrowing sequence where it splits in half, are worth more than all three &quot;Matrix&quot; films put together.) These effects don't dazzle us with over-the-top demonstrations of what computers are capable of; they do what great effects should and bring the spectacle to life. And they don't show a hint of artifice.<br />In short, &quot;Titanic&quot; is a grand, sweeping epic where the melodrama is never overdone and the epic length is never boring. But thefact is, even if that weren't the case, it would be worth watching just to SEE it. This is not on the same plateau as a timeless masterpiece like &quot;Casablanca&quot; or &quot;Citizen Kane,&quot; but it is a very good film. One of the best of 1997 -- not quite as good as &quot;L.A. Confidential,&quot; its main rival for that year's Best Picture Oscar, but not so distant in quality that its victory can be considered a travesty (kind of like when &quot;Dances with Wolves&quot; beat the superior &quot;Goodfellas&quot; in 1990 -- yes, the runner-up was better, but by so little that the winner was every bit as deserving). And, as with any movie review on this site, mine is the only one worth paying attention to. It doesn't claim that the film is boring just because it won Best Picture and had a romance; it doesn't heap praise upon the movie just because it had good-looking leads. It acknowledges the superior quality of a good film, which is what a QUALIFIED reviewer, and not a malcontent who feels the need to trash anything coming out of present-day Hollywood, is supposed to do.
0425129616|5.0|This is the first Christie and the first Hercule Poirot novel.  The action opens with Hastings describing his first adventure with Poirot.  They become involved in solving a death in a locked room with the most obvious suspect being the husband.  Many twists and turns later Poirot prevails and justice is served.<br />Hastings circumstances (invalid army officer alone in the world) are very like Dr. Watson. The relationship between Hastings and Poirot is similiar to Watson and Holmes in that Hastings is the bumbler, always leaping to the wrong conclusion while Poirot, like Holmes, drops little hints but by in large keeps his companion in the dark until the last minute.  <br />Christie began her pattern here of going against established mystery conventions (most obvious suspect being innocent) while playing fair, (all clues are fairly laid out for the reader).  The trademark Christie twists and turns are here as well.<br />This novel was originally published in 1920 and many of the details show its age.  There are references to things that the modern reader will not be familiar and some comments are absolutely not politically correct but these do not detract from the story and in fact enforce the WWI English country house setting.<br />This is a 'must read' for any Christie fan, and highly recommended for any fan of 'cozy' mysteries.
0446677450|5.0|I firmly believe in education. I've taken loans for my Bachelors and Masters degrees. I've lived overseas and thought I had it all figured out, except that I couldn't figure out how to live the way I wanted without having massive credit card debt.  This book, and the next RichDadPoorDad CashFlowQuadrant book, gave me just the slight re-adjustment needed to see things clearer about how to live the life you want - time for family and travel. The formula: do your investing First, then, go live the life you want. START HERE then go figure out what to invest in.
0375701427|5.0|My initial reaction to AMERICAN PASTORAL was that it was a search to understand a life characterized by a shell of outward perfection hiding unimaginable family horror, one which mirrored Americas own wrenching progress from liking Ike to dissing Dick.  I loved the rhythm of the probing, uncertain prose, but like a lot of readers (apparently), felt it rambled at times.  Then, on the advice of a friend who had read the book a second time, I went back to the section on Zuckermans high school reunion, the conversation with Jerry Levov about his brother the Swede and, in particular, Zuckerman's own thoughts about sharing the book he had written about the Swede with Jerry before submitting it for publication (chronologically, the end of the book).  Doing that completely threw my original opinion for one big loop, as I realized the Swede's story was in fact the product of Zuckerman's imagination and not the imparted truth of an omniscient narrator, as I had somehow managed to lull myself into believing.   Instead, AMERICAN PASTORAL became the story of a literally gutted writer (he's had his prostateand many might say, for Zuckerman, his Muse--removed) paying homage to his craft.  Except for the general fact that his daughter Merry bombed a local post office, the Swede's whole story in Book 2 is a fabrication, ultimately saying more about the writers power to move, shock and tell a damn good story than it does about Seymour Levov and America in the Sixties.  In that regard, the books two most powerful conceits are the passionate kiss during Merry's 11th summer and the Swedes encounters with Rita Cohen.  Both are charged with sexual grotesquery, and both are so at odds with anything we actually do know about the Swede that you have to wonder if they are only the product of Zuckerman's musings.  But why would Zuckerman fabricate such shocking scenes about one of the nicest guys youll ever find in modern literature?  That's what I could not figure out.  And I concluded its because they're not for figuring out, just as great stories and the art of great storytelling are not for figuring out, but for stirring emotion and provoking thought.  And, in the case of AMERICAN PASTORAL, not on such relative ephemera as the dysfunction of Sixties America, but on timeless subjects of fate, shifting fortune, family and loss that are more the province of Greek or Shakespearean or Biblical tragedy.  As I was reading AP, Merry's quick unravelling unnerved me no end, both because of the idea that it could happen to any family, and because I have my own daughter, making even the slightest analogies to Merry all the scarier. But as I finished the book, and especially after Id re-read the reunion episode, the character I kept thinking about was Lou, who Zuckerman portrays as a kind of loveable, old-world, avuncular character when he is no doubt (as Zuckerman's imagined conversation with Jerry about Lous portrayal suggests) a ... of an employer, husband and father. The other character that forced me to re-think the book was Rita Cohen, one of the most gut-churning characters I've ever come across. She is so pernicious, so unremittingly cruel, that she can only be digested as an abstraction: part Macbeth witch, part Greek chorus and part Hamlet's ghost, always there to stir up the Swede's pot and propel his fate.  (I also wonder if she isnt a wry jab by Roth at those who call him a misogynist, as if hes saying, You think my female characters are bad role models? Try this one on for size.)  Viewing the story as an abstraction also made me appreciate Roth's style of poking around the edges of issues, trying to find the heart of many weighty matters.  What at first seemed rambling instead became lyrical, and, in the end, made every word feel vital.
B0000DD7NL|5.0|Alicia Keys always pulls off original Rn'B tracks. But this album went even further, and on some songs sounds similar to earlier rythm n' blues of artists like Marvin Gaye and Stevie Wonder. It also includes hip-hop as her albums usually do. It's one you'll never get sick of!
0767830555|5.0|I don't think I need to say any more about the movie itself - that's pretty much covered by the other reviewers.  But something MUST be said about the incredible soundtrack by Bernard Herrmann.  I have seen a lot of movies in my time, and there are some great soundtracks out there, but this one is beyond compare.  It is dark and seething and apocalyptic in a way that no other soundtrack I've heard has been able to achieve.  It adds such depth and dimension to the film that there are moments where you almost feel as if you are drowning in the atmosphere that is conjured.  If I were to rate all of best film soundtracks according to how perfectly they match the mood and the undercurrents of the film, this would be, hands down, #1.
B000002JSJ|4.0|Even though Plants vocals are not up to their old standards throughout this album, I feel it still comes together nicely.  Achilles Last Stand is a masterpiece, that song can only be described as an all out epic!  <BR>For Your Life is probably my favorite song off the album, it has a great sound to it and with Plants more suttle vocals in this album, it sets the whole grim feel of cocaine use perfectly.<BR>Royal Orleans, a fun tune to listen to.  It is about a member of the band who woke up in bed with a drag queen and ended up setting the place ablaze, Plant is hard to understand in this one though, so you have to look at the lyrics to see what its about.<BR>Nobodys Fault But Mine, Im not a big fan of this song, it never seems to take off and is too repetitive.  I like the hermonica use in it though and Page's guitar solo is great as usual.<BR>Candy Store Rock, Ohh baby Baby, another cool rockin song, it sounds like grim even though its spossed to be like an upbeat cheary song.<BR>Hots Off to Nowhere, This is another one of my favorites from this album.  Has a good beat to it, vocals are decent in this song.  <BR>Tea For One, probably one of, if not my favorite Zeppelin blues song.  It is just so blusey, and unlike other songs on this album, Plant comes out pretty clear with the vocals.  The rest of the band really sets the lonely, somber mood of the song perfectly, an overall impressive song!<br />This album is much better then some people say, its different then other albums but it is not bad by anymeans.  It really seems to sound better after a few listens.

B0000UHFC6|5.0|First off, I'd like to say, if you have not seen the Return of the King, you have no business whatsover to be sticking your nose into the music. You must see the movie before you buy this soundtrack. <br />Howard Shore is ingenious. Each song captures the beauty and harmony of every scene in the movie. For instance, Shelob's Lair is by far one of the best tracks. You can feel the emotions put forth into the music, the dynamics are OUSTANDING. <br />The Steward of Gondor carries us away with the beautiful flute solo and Billy Boyd's voice is magnificent. It is very much a depressing song, but nevertheless beautiful.<br />Into the West is quite stunning. Annie Lennox knows how to scare people with that voice of hers. Strong and powerful it is, yet calm and soothing. You will find yourself close to tears if you often listen to that song. <br />This further concludes my &quot;review&quot; of the Return of the King soundtrack. I do not want to spoil anyone's ears. Do buy this CD. It is worth it.
B00005JM0B|5.0|Why five stars? Surely this is not Terminator 1 or 2 you say? The truth be told that it is not, but this movie is still a five star sci-fi action fest that simply blows most sci-fi movies out of the water. It is not the best of the Terminator series but it is still an excellent movie and more importantly this is Schwarzenegger and he IS back.<br />It has been almost 10 years since Arnie did a good movie (True Lies). When you compare T3 to the likes of - Junior, Eraser, Jingle All the Way, Batman &amp; Robin, End of Days, The 6th Day and Collateral Damage you should be thankful for seeing the man back doing what he does best.<br />T3 is far better than any of us could have hoped it would have been without Cameron at the helm. Not only was this vehicle a darn good summer blockbuster but it was THE summer blockbuster film for 2003 and simply knocked Matrix: Revolutions for ten in terms of meeting the audience's expectations.<br />T3 cuts to the chase almost ten minutes into the film. The connections do defy belief though (John Conner hooks up with the daughter of the only man who can stop Skynet almost fifteen minutes into the film) but when all is said and done you just don't care because when Arnie comes on screen it is ALL TERMINATOR from start to finish. The director has also taken a very different approach to the theme of \\"fate\\" and the ending, surprisingly, is a corker of a crack ending that is also better than any third instalment in the series could have delivered. The special effects and action sequences are on top form and T3 also boasts huge amounts of well-placed humour like Arnie's dead-pan and on-que one liners (\\"Your Fianc&eacute;e is Dead. Let's go.\\" )<br />Is this a worthy contender? Hell yeah! and more. The DVD in its crisp transfer looks amazing and there is a powerhouse of stunts and action sequences to keep the audience entertained throughout its many plot twists and turns. This is not a bad sequel at all... in fact if Mostow helms the next one who is going to complain? Sure Cameron is not here and it is more PG orientated, but if you like T1 and T2 and are prepared to give a little leeway to the series without Cameron then T3 is the surprise summer blockbuster hit package. It also has lots of nostalgia and little moments from T1 and T2 thrown in. Like I said - It is all good!<br />By the way - Cameron said he liked it. The series may be milked but what the hell.. it does not disappoint and seeing a female terminator and Arnie smashing sevens shades of brown out of each other is something new in cinema to say the least.  Just seeing a female take on the man of bronze is worth the rental alone and for those who really like it  - DVD ownership IS INEVITABLE.<br />No collection can be embarrassed about adding this one to the other two.ing to complain?

B00005MP58|5.0|The DVD edition that I speak of is ASIN: B00005MP58.  I mention it because I read the other reviews before purchasing and almost didn't purchase it because of one review that wrote scathing criticism of the color.<br />The complexions are lighter than in the TV production that I taped when it first aired but in my opinion that is in keeping with the 19th century ideal of a creamy white complexion for ladies.  Any lady with any color was considered common and not a lady.<br />The color on the costums and in every other aspect is quite good.<br />This widescreeen, anamorphic version adds a great deal to my enjoyment and it is now possible to get a look at more of the spectacular detail put into this production.<br />The additional footage answers some of my questions about minor characters which provides more clarity and realism.<br />This is the very first DVD that I purchased with my new DVD player and it was first because my own taped version was wearing out and no longer pleasant to watch because it had been played so many times.<br />I never tire of watching this movie because of the wonderful character studys and the humor along with the story.  This has become my absolute favorite movie and my standby.<br />Don't hesiteate to add this DVD to your collection.
B000003TA4|5.0|This is what caused a million teens to buy their first album ever. They did not go too far wrong with Nirvana &quot;Nevermind&quot; who smashed through the techno beep beep beep with an album that brought lyrics back into fashion again. You do not know how much singers and songwriters owe to this group.<br />This is grunge at its classic best.
0425152251|2.0|The concept of this book is fairly interesting. A teenage girl begins to receive letters from a stranger. He introduces her to philosophy in terms of a chronological study of the major philosophers from the Greeks to the likes of Sartre. As such, the book describes an easy approach to philosophy for a teenager and it presents itself also as such.<br />However, it all became too much for me. The whole thing is quite pedantic. Most readers of all ages will not be able to identify with the characters Hilde and Sophie very well. As such, the actual story (outside the notes on philosophy) is basically a backdrop and definitely reads as such. As for the notes, they may be regarded well by some but patronising by others. When the major thoughts of a philosophical school or personality are reduced to ten pages of pop-style explanations (which in itself isn't a bad way of presenting it), it requires excellent organisation to make the text both representative of the philosopher and interesting. Gaarder has done neither in my opinion.<br />A mildly useful read in terms of acquainting oneself with the major philosophers. There are many better texts for that purpose though.
B0000W3YIS|5.0|I gave the standard edition of Britney Spears' &quot;In The Zone&quot; a 4 star rating, but I'm giving the IMPORT edition a 4.5 star rating for the two bonus tracks.<br />I heavily prefer &quot;Dong Hang Up&quot; over &quot;The Answer&quot;. I think it's the better one of the two featued bonus tracks (discluding the &quot;MATM Remix&quot; . . . which is featured on the standard edition.)<br />If you can't download these bonus tracks and have a little extra $$ to spend, definitely buy this CD! The bonus tracks and worth spending an extra $10 on.<br />The other two non-album tracks only available thru Wal-Mart.com or downloading, &quot;I've Just Begun (Having My Fun)&quot; and &quot;Me Against The Music [Dragon Man Remix]&quot; (which doesn't really feature Madonna like the other two versions) are also OK songs.<br />&quot;In The Zone&quot; is definitely much better than her three previous releases. I just wish Britney's &quot;Toxic&quot; video wasn't so . . . sucky. The song's a hit! Anyway, keep up the good work, Brit!
B000002H33|5.0|Screw this being the best metal album ever, it is the best album of any music genre.  The only things that come close are Pink Floyd's Dark Side of the Moon or the Beatles Sgt. Peppers.  Anything that resembles rock and roll borrows something from this album.  Some may think I am crazy, saying a Metallica album is this influential, but if you are a naysayer, take a listen and really explore the lyrics as well as the awesome musical composition.
B00005RY7X|5.0|this is pop bliss. not too bubble gummy &amp; not too atrociously terrible. only the trully open minded can enjoy this here, if you're too busy dying to be taken seriously &amp; have a stick in your ass, then this isn't for you. &amp; for the record, HE KNOWS that the music he makes is...for lack of better words, bland &amp; unoriginal, but it's still amazing. bottom line is Andrew WK is better than your favorite band.
B00001R3GC|5.0|Im a Beatles fan more than a RS fan but I love this record<BR>and deserves 5 exact starts...here's my contribution!!<br />Althought Brown Sugar its not my prefer RS song, other sogs like<BR>Sister Morphine, Moonlight Mile, Can you hear me Knocking,<BR>Dead Flowers, etc are out of range. Great Rock and Roll Record!!!<br />Wait for new remastered editions!!!
B00005O5CM|1.0|It would be easy for the common person to bash Legally Blonde.  I, on the other hand, have closely studied this film and have found it to be one of the best productions of our time, as it represents true artistic expression.<br />Look at the storyline:  The protagonist, Elle Woods (Reese Witherspoon), is deeply in love with her long time boyfriend, Warner Huntington (Matthew Davis) and believes he will deliver an engagement ring during their next date.  Instead he dumps her for another girl who he claims is \\"more serious.\\"  Apparently Warner's family-prestigious, wealthy East Coasters-would according to him, not approve of this capricious, spoiled Beverly Hills princess.  But it's not a Romeo and Juliet scenario, since (1) Warner is unhappy with Elle Woods anyway, and (2) she has never met his parents.  Actually, the best way to describe this movie is The Paper Chase meets Clueless.  Ok, back to the story...Elle Woods must win back her man, so she decides to \\"get serious.\\"  To prove that she is worthy to be his bride, she aces the LSAT and applies to his law school, Harvard University (one of three universities ever mentioned in movies).  She gets accepted-with the help of a swimsuit video she created exclusively for the admissions committee-and somehow begins the new school year in the same class as her ex-boyfriend (and his new girlfriend) all within a six-month period.<br />Is this a good message to send to our youngsters?  Completely change your life's direction to chase down a boyfriend or girlfriend who doesn't like you?  No! But if we look beyond this clich&eacute; story line, as well as the poor acting, atrocious direction, ludicrous dialog, and pitiful editing, there is a brilliant message shining through.  And what is interesting is that the message comes not from the story, but from the production itself, i.e., writers, directors, editors, actors, craft services, key grip, best boy, gaffers, cinematographer, etc.  Essentially, they have shown the importance of finishing an objective at any cost and without any judgment.<br />There is a strong parallel between the underlying message delivered by the production of Legally Blonde and the overall message of the classic film Apocalypse Now.  Apocalypse Now, adapted from the stirring novella, Heart of Darkness by Joseph Conrad, depicts the young military captain, Benjamin L. Willard (Martin Sheen), ordered to journey up a river to ultimately assassinate the renegade Colonel Walter E. Kurtz (Marlin Brando).  Yet, as Willard ventures up the river into the darkest parts of the jungle, he also ventures into the deepest, darkest parts of himself.  I believe that the production crew of Legally Blonde experienced a similar situation:  as production progressed each day, they advanced further along the river of their soul, exploring the horrible darkness within.  Clearly these dedicated people tapped into some dark, internal ugliness to produce Legally Blonde, as I can rank it as one of the worst films I've seen in a long time; perhaps worse than Titanic, Tremors, and Losing Isaiah.  But that's what so brilliant about the movie!  The production crew expressed themselves in a completely novel, artistic, and moving way.<br />I often think about the strength and courage of the Legally Blonde production members.  If I had 1/10 of their qualities, I'd be unstoppable in this world.  A person of average moral judgment would have walked off the set on day 1.  But not these people!  They were strong and dedicated.  In Apocalypse Now, Colonel Kurtz makes a parallel argument to Willard regarding his admiration towards the ruthlessness and courage of Vietcong soldiers in the Vietnam War:<br />***And I thought: My God...the genius of that. The genius. The will to do that. Perfect, genuine, complete, crystalline, pure.  And then I realized they were stronger than we. Because they could stand that these were not monsters...These were men...trained cadres...these men who fought with their hearts,who had families, who had children, who were filled with love...but they had the strength...the strength...to do that. If I had ten divisions of those men our troubles here would be over very quickly. You have to have men who are moral...and at the same time who are able to utilize their primordial instincts to kill without feeling...without  passion... without judgment...without judgment. Because it's judgment that defeats us.***<br />Clearly, if the production crew of Legally Blonde had any judgment, the movie would have been scrapped during pre-production.  And I repeat the words of Kurtz, \\"...Because it's judgment that defeats us.\\"<br />Another intriguing parallel between Legally Blonde and Apocalypse Now is \\"production culture.\\"  Apocalypse Now was filmed in the jungles of the Philippines.  Trust me, this was no Club Med!  The actors and crew became violently ill and lost a lot of body weight from tropical diseases, Martin Sheen suffered a heart attack as well as mental problems, and the Director, Francis Coppola, came close to losing his home due to financial problems.  They were lucky to eat one meal per day consisting of rice and unknown meat substances.  According to the account by Sofia Coppola in Hearts of Darkness: A Film Maker's Apocalypse, the actors and crew came close to experiencing first hand what our Vietnam soldiers experienced living in the jungles of Vietnam (minus the combat of course).<br />Likewise in Legally Blonde, Reese Witherspoon, and the other actors and crew relocated for two months to Cambridge Massachusetts, to film on location.  It was shot during spring, so the weather was relatively warm, but not too hot and humid like it is during the summer months.  Additionally, Reese sat in on a few classes at Harvard Law School so she could get a first-hand experience of the lifestyle of a law student.  She even read a few pages of one of the books that typical law students read.<br />Most people will see Legally Blonde and think, \\"This movie is so bad I can't believe it.\\"  But is it?  Clearly not.  It is a masterpiece that may go unrecognized for decades to come.  Hopefully this world will give it a chance and look for the underlying brilliance!ho had families, who had children, who were filled with love...but they had the strength...the strength...to do that.

B00005ASHM|3.0|I dont know why this is a Classic!!!<br />Some songs like God Only Knows and Johnnie B are great songs.<BR>All the arrangements are also great in all the album, in its time.<br />But other songs are less than the average in the pop musical world!!<br />Try to listen but find little original songs.
B000088E6D|3.0|I have to say, first of all, that Michael Buble has a great voice. But, I have to agree with a lot of the people that have written reviews. I don't hear passion or sincerity. My three favorites are \\"Sway\\", \\"Come Fly with Me\\" and \\"Summer Wind\\". I think he's much better with the older songs. I sense he is more comfortable with them. He sings them with more ease. He struggles with the newer songs. The mediocre arrangements and his lack of passion on the newer songs don't stack up. \\"You'll Never Find Another Love\\", \\"Crazy Little Thing\\" and especially \\"How Can You Mend A Broken Heart\\"....BORING!! I skip over them. Don't get me wrong, I like him, but just think he ought to stick to the older songs, or pick different songs matched with better arrangements. His choice of newer songs leaves something to be desired. Can't figure why he chose them. But, all in all, a decent cd.

0060536969|4.0|This is another fast-paced, bio-tech thriller by this author. Expertly weaving his narrative, the author grips the reader with his tale of nanotechnology gone wrong. While the book is wholly plot driven, with little attention paid to any character development.  this lack does not unduly detract from the enjoyment of the book, as the plot is so gripping.<br />The plot revolves around stay at home dad, Jack Forman, who was a  whistle-blower about some high-tech espionage going on in the company  for which he worked. Unfortunately, he revealed what he had discovered it to the wrong person  and, consequently, was fired for his pains. While at home, he notices that his wife, who is a mover and a shaker for a bio-tech firm, has been acting a little odd and suspects her of an illicit affair.<br />When her company wants to hire him to check out some programming problems at  their Nevada facility, Jack jumps at the opportunity. He then discovers that the firm has engaged in an experiment that has gone out of control. A swarm of nanoparticles, designed as micro-robots and programmed to act as one mind, has escaped from the environs of the firm's desert laboratory. Programmed to be predatory, the swarm is deadly and evolving into something even more sinister with every passing moment.<br />Moreover, he notices that it isn't only his wife that is acting a little odd. Others at the facility with the swarm problem are also acting a little strange. All is definitely not what it seems. The only question is whether Jack, with the help of the scientists at the facility, can take control of the swarm before the swarm overwhelms and controls them.<br />This book keeps the reader riveted, despite the fairly predictable, formulaic plot. As do many of the author's other books, it also presents some serious ethical and moral issues for consideration by the reader, and the author himself gives a fairly detailed, cautionary foreword on the dangers of nanotechnology.<br />I unwittingly bought the abridged, rather than the unabridged, audio book version for a road trip but was not disappointed.  Narrated by Broadway and silver screen veteran Robert Sean Leonard, he keeps the story flowing in a nice, easy way, leaving the listener wanting to hear more. Quite frankly, when I arrived at my destination, I could barely tear myself away from the car, so engrossed was I by the story and its telling.  It is a highly enjoyable, plot driven book.the abridged, rather than the unabridged, audio book version for a road trip but was not disappointed.

B00012QM8G|5.0|before i got to see this movie, being an asian and being considerably young means that our corner of the world was not familiar with what happened in to our jewish brothers then. but after seeing this movie, and seeing a facsimile of what really transpired during world war 2, i have suddenly realized the real horror of war and hatred. <br />this movie singlehandedly erased the so-called glory of war portrayed in the movies of the past, and turned a lot of people into thinking how ugly and inhuman war and prejudice really are. if this was spielberg's aim, to open our eyes to the reality that was the final solution and to a bigger picture the reality of man's brutality, then he has succeeded. <br />this movie should be a standard in history classes!
B000092ZYX|4.0|This album has a lot of good songs on it. In my opinion it's not as good as The Bends, Kid A, or OK Computer but I did enjoy it more than Amnesiac. The best way to describe this album is a mix of OK Computer + Kid A/Amnesiac. You have you're guitar songs like Go To Sleep and 2+2=5. There are also songs like Where I End And You Begin and Backdrifts which has that Kid A/Amnesiac sound to it. Overall this album shows Radiohead is still making great music.
B00008PW2D|4.0|I would be lying if I said that I was not a little bit disappointed in the short season.  However, this season brought the characters to a whole new level.  They matured in ways we wouldn't have expected.  Carrie's short rendevouz with Big was almost reminiscent of the first season and the question of having sex like a man, no strings attached.  Samantha's emotions for a man and her courage to let him go, showed Samantha in the same light of her relationship with James.  Samantha could be committed, even sex-crazed as she was.  Miranda has to deal with the \\"burden\\" of Brady, bringing out her motherhood skills which we all doubted her to have.  Finally, we see Charlotte question her beliefs in love and romance.  True, this season was not as emotional or as much of a love-crisis roller coaster as the previous four, but like I said before, as a dedicated fan of the show, I was very glad to see the characters grow up and mature in ways that we wouldn't have expected.  They showed an unexpected maturity that forces you into the big thrills that await you in the sixth and final season.  A must have for the fan, or even for the casual watcher.  If you like Sex and the City, you need these 8 episodes.  And, the cost?  What is money for, but to splurge every now and then.
B0000931OG|5.0|When I first heard listened to Think Tank, the only sounds that caught my attention were Out Of Time, Sweet Song, and Battery In Your Leg. I was not too impressed with the overall album. I gave the album a second listen and found more songs that I enjoyed. After a third listen, I realized how great the album is overall. This is by far my favorite Blur album. It's the one Blur album I listen to more than any other of my Blur albums. The funny thing is that I never knew about Me White Noise until about 3 months after listening through the album. Me White Noise made me love this album even more. I would have to say this is my 2nd favorite album of 2003.
B00003CXA6|5.0|\\"Gettysburg,\\" based on the book \\"Killer Angels\\" is my absolute favorite movie of all time.  I think Martin Sheen did a fine job as Lee, contrary to many other reviewers here, and all the other actors seemed to fit thier character perfectly, just as I would imagine them to be.  It has nice speaches which express the characters thoughts and emotions well, especially Chamberlains speech about freedom, and an the war, Busters speech about why hes fighting the war and about the evil doings back in Ireland, and Armisteads speach to the British military observer (Freemantle) about his men and thier duty and heritage. All in all its a very moving, exciting, great movie.  I have watched this movie more times than I would like to admit.
0385504209|2.0|THIS is the book everyone's talking about?  You're kidding me.  I've read at least a dozen mystery/thrillers this year better than THE DA VINCI CODE.  The plot - about a religious sect seeking to keep an ancient secret hidden - comes right out of a Saturday morning cartoon.  And the characters are about as believable as an honest politician.  I saw where the story was going from the first couple of chapters - most intelligent readers will too.  It just goes to show you that popularity isn't everything.<br />Antelope Jones
0345446798|5.0|Patricia McConnell really captivates the art form of learning the language of canines. What really intreagued me about this book is not only does it discuss the behavior of dogs, but also the behavior of us - their handlers! You learn how even the slightest movement can make all the difference in getting your dog to listen to you. This is an essential book for any dog trainers, animal behaviorists, or just dog owners/lovers!
B0000640SA|5.0|Memento is a terrific movie with excellent acting, complex structure, and fine editing.  It reveals new layers even after many viewings and is an empathetic depiction of unfamiliar memory-centered medical and ethical problems.  I really recommend the movie.  Guy Pearce gets the audience to appreciate the character's situation and sympathize.<br />Still, Leonard Shelby (Pearce's character) is shown killing three people and beating up and kidnapping a third.  One of his persistant acquaintences, Teddy (Joe Pantoliano), claims Leonard has killed yet a fourth person.  Leonard is neither remorseful nor restrained by religious feelings.  He might be considered a smiling psychopath, even allowing for the memory deficiency.  If he doesn't get his inciting tattoos removed, he might be serial killing for the rest of his life.  This Guy is something else!
B00005TT77|4.0|I wasn't dissapointed with this CD, but nor was I thrilled. It's a great soundtrack for anyone who likes The Beatles (who doesn't?) and other &quot;oldies&quot;. &quot;Blackbird&quot; by Sarah McLachlan is a song that shines and is my favorite on the CD. I suggest you see the movie first because not only is it great but you can decide if you like the songs from it.
B0001BKAEY|5.0|This will be the most wanted dvd this year, after the reloaded comes the revolution, this dvd will include incredible footage and special features like:<br />* Future Gamer The Matrix Online - An introduction to the massive multi-player game The Matrix Online, created by the Wachowski Brothers.<br />* 3-D Evolution- Transition to different levels of the Matrix to view concept art, storyboards, pre-visualizations and realizations for several elements in Revolutions.<br />* Before the Revolution - 3-D timeline of the concurrent story development occurring in the Matrix between the Matrix trilogy, The Animatrix, and Enter the Matrix. <br />Will be a 2 disc edition, so there will be more hours of matrix. <br />(This is my first amazon review, so sorry for my bad english)
B0000A1RJI|3.0|On the good side, as the purpose of a score goes, I would give it a 5.  I was on the edge of my seat while watching the movie based in no small part on the pulse of the music.  So I had to then get the CD.  It really helped make the movie the great entertainment it was.<br />Now for the bad - the recording quality was TERRIBLE.  I can't believe Disney let something that bad get into the open.  And it was way too short.  It REALLY needed one of the battle scenes in its entirety - there wasn't one track over 5 minutes from a 2 hour 23 minute movie.  Hence my total score for the CD is a middle of the road 3.<br />Disney can redeem itself by putting out an extended version of the score, better mastered than the first.  I know that I will rush to buy it if they do!  Hear that, Michael Eisner?
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I watched Firefly when it first aired on Fox nearly a year ago.  As a matter of fact my son was born on the first night Firefly crossed our airwaves.  My wife must have seen how much I loved the show and recently gave me the DVD set as a Christmas gift.  I was extremely happy to own a copy of the series and watched all 14 episodes immediately.  My fondness for the Firefly universe (verse) is so intense that I would equate it to clich 'Love at first sight'.  <BR>It is so easy to believe in each of the 9 characters.  It is as if they leap out of the TV screen.  As I get older and wiser I understand how important character development is and without great characters and their interactions with one another, you really have nothing but empty space and special effects.  After watching the last episode I Found myself wanting to watch it again and again, but this time trying to understand why I love it so much more than anything I have seen before.  I generally don't put much effort in a 'cause', but I feel the need to express my passion for this amazing story.  I pray that Universal (or some movie outfit) will pick up the movie rights as soon as humanly possible.  I need to see more....I feel as though I have lost someone very close to me and I guess that is why 'it is better to have loved and lost than to have never loved at all.<BR>Go Browncoats!! (and NE Patriots too)
B00000J7JO|4.0|This is the Peppers' best album since the genious \\"Blood Sugar Sex Magic\\" was out. And the line-up is the same again. And once again you hear a lot of quality songs in Peppers' specific funky style. What differs this record is that it never gets as mindlessly funny, as BSSM sometimes got. I think, that's because with age band-members became more serious persons, and more professional with their instruments and composing skills. Most songs are slower, mellower and more aimed inwards, to the soul. This is a nice relaxing album, with some depth to the tracks. It just lacks the spark of perfection that BSSM had plentiful, but still is a good purchase. Many nice melodies will surely please you.<br />Yet, if you want your music energetic and funny, you're probably best heading to the Peppers' starting albums.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Some would surely disagree with me as to the above assertion, but I am dumbfounded as to how I missed this when it was on the air. This is a surprisingly good show, to which I was introduced only when the DVDs came out. I tried this show because of Joss Whedon, as I was such a big fan of Buffy, and Nathan Fillion, whom I enjoyed as Caleb in Buffy season 7. I don't know how Joss does it, but his shows have a way of sticking with you, his characters linger in my head long after they have disappeared from the screen. Firefly is a perfect example, a show built around nine space travelers each of whom are dynamic, fleshed out characters including the captain, a registered companion (legal form of prostitute) who rents a shuttle, a brother and sister who are fleeing the Alliance, a chaplain, and a man who is a veritable mercenary and tempted by the financial possibilities of betraying the crew. Additionally, Joss has a way of creating an amazing backdrop for his stories. In Firefly, there was the war for unification between the Alliance and the Independents (a.k.a. Browncoats) which leaves a world with central Alliance-loyal planets and outer reaches where the law does not extend, home to all manner of people, including the flesh-eating Reavers who might not be called people at all. Add to these things some great sets and special effects and a memorable bluegrass theme penned by Joss himself, and you have a wonderful show. It's a shame it only lasted one season.
0790740443|3.0|Kurt Russell as an action star? I know that sounds funny, but after you see this movie, you will believe it. I will admit, I thought this movie was going to bite it hard when it came out. I thought it looked cool, but it had &quot;rental&quot; written all over it. After seeing it years ago, I came away entertained. Which is all that really matters, if you think about it. Now that you can get it for a nice price, I would recommend checking it out.<br />Kurt Russell plays a bio-engineered soldier. He is chosen from birth and trained to kill. That is his only life he knows. He is shown gruesome violence as a young child. He is trained to have no mercy and no remorse. He is a killing machine made by some sort of government. They take children from birth and literally train them to become ruthless soldiers. When they get to their adult years, they are sent out on the battlefield. They are then the perfect soldiers. Of course, there are some downsides to this. They have no social skills. They have never had emotions toward other human beings. And this is where the movie seperates itself from being a 'B-movie'.<br />Over time, a new super-soldier is created. One that is literally made from the DNA up. This is where the conflict of the movie arises. Sgt. Todd's (Russell) squad is being replaced by a squad of advanced soldiers that are even better than Russell's. They are led by Caine (Jason Scott Lee). Lee plays a pretty decent villianous character. Even though he is just following orders. The orders are coming down from a higher ranking officer (played by Jason Isaacs). Isaacs seems to enjoy this role of playing the main villian. He never goes over the top, but he definately makes you not like him. Gary Busey actually plays a character that is NOT insane. He plays a general (or something) that is the head of the old soldiers. He is reluctant to switch over to the newer soldiers without them ever being tested in the field. Isaac's character overrules him.<br />So, Russell is dumped like trash onto some planet that has been 'abandoned' (or so they think), and it only used for waste disposal. Upon waking, he is found by a group of outlanders who are living on the plant. They have formed a sort of colony and live peacefully without interference. It is here that Sgt. Todd must learn some human emotion and traits to live with normal human beings. Of course the bad guys want to test out the new brand of soldiers. They send them on (what they think) is a routine &quot;sweep &amp; clear&quot; mission. Little do they know that Sgt. Todd is still alive and is willing to show them a thing or two.<br />This is an action movie with some heart to it. I thought this was going to be a Rambo-type movie with Russell in the lead role. I was wrong. He defends his new friends and fights for their survival. Along the way, he learns what it's like to care for other people. One of these people is a woman (the insanely HOT Connie Nielson). Her husband was one of the first to befriend Todd. After his death, he takes it upon himself to protect her and her son. <br />I liked this movie quite a bit. It's kinda low budget and it is an action film. It's not going to win any awards, but it's way better than I thought it would be. I was surprised how big Kurt Russell got for this movie. He only has like 10-15 lines the whole flick and he plays the 'commando' character well. Honestly, I would not pay $20 for this movie, but for $10 it's a steal. It's a fun, yet simple action movie with a nice side of emotion. When I saw the trailer, I was wondering why the hell Russell would want to do a picture like this. After seeing it, I know why.<br />Not many special features here to speak of. You get a commentary, production notes, and a trailer. That's it. You can find the movie for around $6.99 now, so I guess I can't complain about the lack of supplements.
B0000CDLA7|5.0|It took me a couple of tries, but in the end, I really fell in love with this album.  I love the fact that DT continues to explore new avenues of rock with each album, and as a thrash metal album, this is one of the best I've ever heard.  Each song is unique, with superior individual performances as well as great orchestration.  They employ chordal structures and time signature changes which are unique and unfamiliar to this genre of music, making the whole experience challanging as well as pleasurable.  <BR>I understand and respect the negative feelings some have had to the album because it such a departure form their other albums, but that's part of makes it exciting for me.  I wholeheartedly recommend that you give it a listen.
1565117794|3.0|Granted, I love the interweaving of the different faiths, but the ending seems to imply that we choose faith because it's a more entertaining story and that a painful story (without animals) couldn't exist in the same world as God.  If either story can be true, why is the animal version the one that assumes you can be faithful?  Can't both stories include God?  It's like saying scientists can't have faith.  <br />Is that why we have faith, because we prefer a more entertaining story?  Faith is preference?  Doesn't it go down to a deeper truth, not just what we like?  Wasn't that the point of the first part of the book when the three religious men fight over Pi?  We choose the animal version of the story because what we really see is too painful?  If we believe the animal-less, painful version (#2) is the &quot;accurate&quot; story, does that rid us of God?  God, pain, reason, and our interpretation can't coexist?  Can't God exist in the pain?  <br />Okay, enough questions.  I'll tell you what I think.  I believe both stories, and in God.
B0000DD7LB|4.0|My favorite songs are Showdown and Everytime....Everytime is a slow song that shows how much of a good voice she actually has....and showdown is an upbeat type that would be good to dance to...i know most people deny liking Britney Spears but i highly recommend buying this cd...well worth the money!!
B0000DD7LC|5.0|This CD is fabulous,  I love it from start to finish.  I cannot recommend enough for the R&amp;B lovers out there!
B00004XQP4|5.0|This, Dookie, and Insomniac are what I like to call \\"The Holy Green Day Trinity\\" because they are my favorite (and therefore the best) Green Day records. Warning reminds me of \\"Road to Ruin\\" era Ramones mixed with \\"Give 'Em Enough Rope\\"/\\"London Calling\\" era Clash. It's just brilliant. It's like all of the catchy-ness of Dookie, the great punk rock lyrics of Insomniac, mixed with it's own sense of style. Although a much more laid back album than Dookie and Insomniac, it still maintains this sense of punk rock sneer that gives it so much character. Let's do a run through of the songs real quick.<br />1. Warning - Proof that acoustic guitars can still rock just as well as electric. This song just gives the message to live your life and stop worrying about all the rules society gives you to obey.<BR>2. Blood, Sex and Booze - An almost rockabilly-esque song about a sadist/masochistic lifestyle.<BR>3. Church on Sunday - Taking us back to the songwriting style of early Green Day, this basically comes from the perspective of a guy telling a girl that he likes that he'll do anything if she'll be with him. (Ramones - I Wanna Be Your Boyfriend, anyone?)<BR>4. Fashion Victim - I love this song. A driving punk rock fist pumping song about life style obsession and materialism. Reminds me of early Clash.<BR>5. Castaway - A catchy song about being a social outcast and liking it that way.<BR>6. Misery - Is this really Green Day? A great experimental song (featuring Tre Cool on Farfisa, hey!), telling a great story about several characters all interlocked with each other in some coincidental way. Great songwriting.<BR>7. Deadbeat Holiday - Absolutely my favorite song on the album. Foot-stomping pop-punk featuring great lyrics about being an outcast by definition but still holding true to yourself.<BR>8. Hold On - A driving beat, more acoustics, and a great song about being down on your luck, but holding on to your values anyway.<BR>9. Jackass - (See \\"Chump\\" from \\"Dookie)<BR>10. Waiting - One of the radio singles. A great song about kind of starting something anew and the sense of hope that comes with it.<BR>11. Minority - Punk Rock Anthem. Main point: I pledge Allegience to the underworld, one nation under dog there of which i stand alone. A great anthemic sing-along song.<BR>12. Macy's Day Parade - Kind of a downbeat way to end the record. Not a bad song, but i've never really been able to get into it.So in conclusion, this record is fantastic. If you don't own it you're a crazy cracker fool. For shame, For shame. Buy it now buddy, it's gonna be okay.
B0001BKAEE|5.0|The ending of a great story, I liked it very much, as I did the first two, its fun to imagen something like this story ever realy hapening, its cool for peopel to make movies like this one with awsome special efects, story and action, unlike many critics that have been \\"ragin\\" on all the matrix movies, just beacuse you dont like them, that doesnt make the movies suck, if you dont like it dont watch it !!!
B000002N2P|5.0|Purists be damned! I love this band! Green Day are the reason that many kids (myself included) know about punk rock bands of back in the day. I've been listening to Green Day since I was roughly 11, and to this day I still can put on the old albums and have them affect me in the same way. This is Green Day's most rocking album in my opinion. Every track is a punk anthem about alienation, discontent, apathy, neuroticism, and chaos. Another thing that I love about this album is that after their third album &quot;Dookie&quot; they went huge, and this, the album that followed it, was like waving the middle finger at all the kids who were jumping on the Punk bandwagon just because it was popular at the time, throwing mud in the face of those who saw punk as a cute fashion thing that would go away in a month. This album is dirty and raw and out-of-control and keeps you on your toes, ready to rock, even if Green Day are a pop punk band by definition, this is one of the only true examples of punk &quot;i don't give a f*ck&quot; that has been on radio waves, and for that I love it.
6305268843|5.0|I am very happy reading all reviews. I am one of those who are completely hooked on this film. I found it by chance and from that moment on I was in love with the film, the actors, the music. Of course is not a surprise I also love Austen, Bronte and Now voyager. <BR>In Spain this film was released only in Original version theaters. but I was lucky enough to see it.<BR>Scene after scene you are falling for the carachters. Elizabeth is a great and well developed carachter, like charles . The film is clean and concise. It reminds me a painting by Kaspar Friederich.<BR>What can I say ...if you are a romantic sensitive and also sensible person you are going to love it.
0553815229|1.0|Gavin Menzies takes what is an interesting subject - the exploration of the world prior to the age of exploration by the Europeans, and turns it into a flight of fancy. He purports that China discovered North and South America, Australia, Antarctica and various points in between in the years 1421-23. Unfortunately, his science and sense of history ranks up there with Hancock and the Chariots of the Gods.<br />Basically, every thing that we don't understand, rather than being of alien origin or pre-Egyptian origin (theories presented by other fringe historians) must be Chinese. No, don't bother arguing the point. It's all Chinese. And every rumour of some unidentified and never before seen piece of pottery that washed up on a distant shore - that's Chinese too. Every ancient map? Chinese. Every wreck on the ocean floor. Chinese. <br />Menzies throws out about a million darts in the hopes that one of them sticks. Unfortunately, as even rudimentary research shows, he fluffs, exagerates and possibly even outright lies his way through all the &quot;facts&quot; presented in his book.<br />Save your money, and buy something else other than this dross.
B000002U82|5.0|I dont remember when the first time I heard Pink Floyd was. I was probably about 4 because my dad had this album and played it alot. When I was a little kid, I never thought this album would have such a dramatic affect on my life, but it certainly did when I was about 13. &quot;Time&quot;, my favorite song of all time is on this record and it brings back alot of memories for me. Growing up in the suburbs and being a former pothead, this takes me back to the days of sitting in my car behind the Home Depot in the woods and well... you get the idea. Good times. But it wasnt just the affect of the drugs that made me like Pink Floyd, it was the way I could lose myself in the music and drift off into my own little world. The most complex yet understandable and soothing music I have ever heard. Whenever I have a bad day or things just arnt right, I put in this cd and drift away from reality. I litteraly feel like I'm in a dream when I listen to this stuff. Sometimes the dreams are calm and mellow others they are scary and real. This is my favorite album of all time and that says alot for a guy like me loving music the way I do. Everyone should own it. If you get just one Pink Floyd album get this one.
B00006690G|4.0|I remember when I first heard &quot;My Name Is..&quot;, I was like &quot;Oh boy, here's another Beastie Boys wannabe&quot;.  But as time passed I grew to acknowledge Em's lyrical skills, especially after seeing his freestyle scenes in 8mile.  His first two albums were insightful in their own right, The Slim Shady LP introduced him to the world, while The Marshall Mathers LP displayed Em's feeling about the industry and what the driving force behind his creativity was.  Though I'm like most of you who feel he's wrong for spazzing out on his moms all the time.  The Eminem Show shows growth in his lyrical skill, and that's rare for most MC of today's standards because most MC after that big successful LP start replacing their rhyming skills for the mighty dollar bill.  But in Em's case, he has no choice but to improve because of the fact that he's a white rapper, and for white rappers it only takes one bad LP and you'll start hearing how fake they were.  Aside from his lyrical skills improving...that's about it, he's starting to repeat himself.  I mean really, how many times is Em going to bash his mother, the critics, and Kim?  I miss the Slim Shady persona he came into the rap game with, that's what set him apart from other rappers in the commercial arena.  Eminem was proof that you didn't have to be gangsta to be a nice MC.
0312995423|3.0|Digital Fortress concerns the wild world of breaking secret codes and the way the NSA handles them and a new threat named Digital Fortress.<br />The action is fast and hard.  This is another 24-hour story (like Deception Point and Angels &amp; Demons) and follows a similar formula.  It is fun to read and a real page turner, but there are so many flaws that a reader may have their enjoyment derailed.<br />Lets look at a few of the flaws.<br />First, apparently in the minds of intelligent people, the NSA is just or rumor or they have never heard of it at all.  Not very realistic.<br />If you have a super computer and you continually deny its very existence, you should probably not put it under a big glass dome in a major city (the one in the book is under such a dome; clear enough to see the stars at night).<br />If a program is available for download on the Internet and you change it, it does not change the copies that people have already downloaded.<br />There is a secure database separate from the Internet at the beginning of the book, but later it is described as fully connected and under siege from hackers just waiting to get into a system none of them knows exists.<br />Put a bunch of very intelligent people together who can handle just about every problem, but at the end of the book start calling up wild goose theories and stats instead of the standard and obvious (which should have been their first choice).<br />Have a bunch of people whose job is breaking codes and have them disbelieve that there is a code in front of them.<br />There are also plenty of &quot;historical&quot; facts that need to be taken with a grain of salt as they reflect popular opinion of history and not what actually happened.<br />Most of these problems will become evident and contextual if you read, or have read, the book.<br />Still, as I said earlier, it is a fun and fast book.  However, if you have read other Dan Brown books you will probably be able to figure out a lot as it followsthe same formula.
0805062971|1.0|&quot;Fight Club&quot; is a great book if you are a big jock who likes to flex your muscles all of the time.  The plot is about a self-help club with a lot of guys who want to liberate themselves from Swedish furniture by pounding on each other with their fists.  &quot;Fight Club&quot; is an ad that celebrates physical fitness and looks down on those who don't quite fit a certain fashionable physical profile.  And all of this is said in the name of non-conformism.  But wait!  What's more conformist than the belief that working out in a gym and sweating like a pig makes you a better person?  &quot;Fight Club&quot;'s jock-fascism is jockalicious.<br />There's also a latent homoeroticism in the book.  The narrator says that he &quot;wants Tyler&quot; and he has a fantasy about Tyler lifting heavy logs.  That's fine, except that the book pretends to be ultra-macho hetero.<br />Anyway, it's a great book for jocks, folks!<br />I apologize for my poor writing skills, but English is not my first language.
0380789035|2.0|Gods are walking the Earth again... and that is the short summary of this book. But, to make a good book, interesting preposition (or a plot) is not good enough. Thoguh Gaiman had a good idea, idea that could have been developed in a more complex way (considering he got a Nebula for this), book lacks a few important things.<br />Amongst them are: 1. Prolonged narration - author often leads his characters in endless and meaningless converstion, just for sake of building his novel hundred or so pages more than is necessary<br />2. If we take the general idea of strugle of modern and ancinent pantheon out of the picture, what we are left with is average narrative story about lifepath of one man who find himself in strange situation... we read that story about couple hundred times, and this one does not jump out and screams: &quot;Look at me, I'm extraordinaire&quot;<br />3. Ending is catstrophic, just like those endings in a B production movies, with an enexpected twist in the tale, and resolution that satisfies all<br />Eventually, one finds himself wondering wath is good in this book, and one does not find and answer... this is a book that will draw attention for one reading and then it'll be forgotten... if you look for that kind of book I reccomend this, putting all things asside I cannot deny that it is entertaining, but if you look for something else, look elsewhere...
B00005JMTN|5.0|A wonderful movie that leaves you with a warm feeling and alot to think about!!  So many things to differentiate between, that I thought about it alot AFTER the movie.  Great cameos and wonderful acting.  A story within a story and more.  Very worthwhile!!
B000088E6D|5.0|Best purchase I've made in years. <br />Buble' doesn't dissapoint - this is a smooth and effective disc. Warner/Reprise have discovered a winner!!!! <br />Yes, best new voice/disc out there - add this one to your bestsounding collection - may this be the first disc of many more to come of songs done this way as it works so well.<br />Please, more soon!

Richard Rubenstein, a Rhodes scholar AND professor of conflict resolution SPECIALIZING IN RELIGIOUS CONFLICT, in WHEN JESUS BECAME GOD, &quot;With vivid detail and meticulous research recreates the political intrigue, riots, and power struggles of one of the most critical moments in history  - one with startling parallels to our own time.&quot;  This CONTINUING STRUGGLE split the eastern and western church YEARS LATER and is playing out today, thanks to books like Dan Brown's.
B0000DD7LB|5.0|Come on people! You don't have to put the trash can lid on her because she's Britney Spears. I know she's a bit poppy and stuff but believe me, her music has improved now. Her pigtails and bubblegummy tunes have vanished. <BR>This is a hot CD for just anyone. This is a big hybrid of different beats and sounds and great new tunes from the teeny bopper. Being an old fan of hers, I was sure I was going to hate her new stuff as soon as I heard she had hiphop stuff on her new album. But I was wrong.<BR> Though when I listened to it for the first time, I was getting ready to sell it off e-bay, I decided to give it a couple more listens. I discovered the hot new sounds in the album and noticed that Britney has sung in many styles. Though Max Martin had been able to cover up her not do good voice in her previous big hits, the beats make up for it. <BR>My personal favourites are all the songs! It is hard to find a CD with all the songs being great and I think the last CD of that sort was Stripped. <br />There's a big vareity of music and moods in this album unlike Stripped. From the classic club single Me against the music where Madonna's voice blends well with Britney's to the southern hip hop song Boom boom to amazing beats in the well sung Showdown to great to-be single songs like Breathe on me and Outrageous to the hot single Toxic, this CD can manage to catch the attention of people who like her old pop with lovely ballads like Everytime which I think is one of the best ballads I've ever heard and Shadow which is another excellent ballad. Brave new girl is a funky song and Britney actually raps. No, don't laugh. That's what I did when I read that she does but when I heard the song I wasn't laughing. I was just amazed at how many things this girl keeps learning and doing. I wish every song could be a single so that people know the big vareity of music stored in just one CD.
B00004XQP4|4.0|By now, if you've heard the opinions of many a punk rock fanatic, you'd believe Warning is the album where Green Day turns pop, sells out, and loses both the hardcore edge that propelled their 1994 album Dookie to smash status and, more recently, the genre-expanding innovation on 1997's Nimrod. When Warning debuted in October 2000, it generated a mixed reaction from both critics and the fan base. Its less than stellar reception was mirrored on the sales chart, where it debuted at #4 but quickly bottomed out.<br />But despite all the bad press, I really enjoy this album. While it rates a notch below Green Day's earlier outings, it's much more cathcy and upbeat than most other punk rock. Granted, Warning doesn't feature much of the high-octane intensity of similar bands like The Offspring, but I think Green Day sounds best in a simple, upbeat setting, the kind that made their 1994 breakout single \\"Basket Case\\" a smash. In Warning, the trio mixes it up a little with instruments like mandolins, saxaphones, and acoustic guitars, and the end result is a well-rounded package with plenty of zest and infectious hooks. Here's a track by track rundown:<br />Warning - 9/10 Great opener, nice use of acoustic guitars<BR>Blood, Sex, and Booze - 9/10 Good guitars and chorus<BR>Church on Sunday - 9.5/10 One of the album's best, upbeat and infectious<BR>Fashion Victim - 8/10<BR>Castaway - 9/10 Very catchy<BR>Misery - 6.5/10 A little too unorthodox for my tastes, but at least they're not resting on their laurels<BR>Deadbeat Holiday - 8.5/10 Great chorus<BR>Jackass - 8/10 Pretty good. I especially like the jazzy portion<BR>Hold On - 7.5/10 Also pretty good, I like the portion with just guitars and percussion<BR>Waiting - 8/10<BR>Minority - 8/10 Doesn't hold up fabulously over the years, but it's still catchy<BR>Macy's Day Parade 9.5/10 A moving, quiet song in the vain of Good Riddance
B0001CCXZW|5.0|All I have to say is that it was about time!
0783241569|5.0|Ask people if they've seen Notting Hill, and most of them say, 'The one with Hugh Grant and Julia Roberts? The one with that roommate from hell who answers the door in his skivvies and then postures for the paparazzi? That one? Yeah, sure. Who WAS that guy, anyway?' He's Rhys Ifans, and he damn near steals the movie. Each time he's on the screen, he's the only one you watch, just to see what gauche and disgusting stunt he's going to come up with next.<BR>But the movie, the movie...<BR>They don't really make romantic comedies like this anymore, pure fairy tale with more than a few deep bows of gratitude to Roman Holiday. The setup is that a very famous actress stumbles into a London bookseller and she and the bookstore owner fall in love. But there's this huge difference in lifestyle. Can love triumph? Well, duh...<BR>The movie is fluff, pure fantasy, and it requires a huge suspension of belief - but it's wonderful, wonderful, wonderful. See it with someone you love and just sit back and enjoy a great evening.
B00005JLEX|5.0|Who has to die for this DVD set to be released?  Come on, give me a name!!!<br />Seinfeld is the funniest series EVER! The ONLY comedy show for real human beings not afraid of laughing at themselves.<br />I can just imagine the head executive of the show now, \\"Fools, let them squirm! Seinfeld will be released on DVD when I SAY SO! Hahahaha!\\" (p.s. If anyone knows this guy's name, please post it.  Thanks.)
0790734060|5.0|Over the top in every way, but it works. This multi-Oscar-winning film dramatizes the rivalry between Salieri, the official royal composer for Austrian Emperor Joseph II, and Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, the child prodigy. Tom Hulce plays Mozart, whose probably affliction with Touret's Syndrome may have been responsible for his wild and uncontrollable brattiness. Poor Salieri: he loathes Mozart, is wickedly jealous of him, but can't help but admire his genius and virtuosity - and is ultimately driven mad by the conflict within himself. The music is sublime, the sets lavish, costuming is incredible - acting wonderful, of course.<BR>A pomp and circumstance of a film that manages to put a very human face on these famous and infamous personalities.
073930464X|1.0|I have always found that a good reader can make a mediocre book more interesting and a bad reader exposes weak prose in a few moments. This audio book has the one of the worst readers ever and writing so poor that even George Guidall would be hard pressed to keep me listening.<br />I agree with an earlier reviewer's thought that this book seems to be from before Kellerman's Delaware success. The use of latin names of diseases without a translation and clumsy use of language (When was the last time you found the term &quot;jimcrack&quot; in a novel with a modern setting?). And, this book suffers the worst of Kellerman's other novels: endless and pointless mental dialogue by the lead.<br />All in all this audio recording is a must avoid.
B00005JL7Q|5.0|As soon as I read this book, I knew it'd be made into a movie, and who else but Hugh Grant to play the lead role? Perfect casting, not only of Grant but of everyone else, too. The movie begins with Grant, independently wealthy, a confirmed, selfish and self-centered bachelor who decides to improve his dating odds by seeking out single moms. He of course gets into all sorts of tangles by pretending to be a single dad with a child of his own. Then he meets a boy, the child of a suicidal mother, who becomes both his nemesis and his savior.<BR>Wonderful!
0385504209|5.0|It's been several years since I really sat down to read a book that wasn't strictly educational. I've never had the urge or time to read pure fiction. The DaVinci Code combines the best of both worlds.  I was absolutely fascinated by the facts uncovered in this book and it has made me a born-again reader. I have since spent countless hours on the internet researching facts from Dan's book and according to others, they are right on the money.  I will say this, the book is not for devoted (or closed-minded) Christians. Simply because many people refuse to believe anything besides what they have been told their entire life. I was shocked and amazed...
0738206679|1.0|After reading a third of the book, I finally gave up out of sheer disinterest.  The way the book is presented would probably be ideal for a student of network dynamics, or even a mathmetician.  For an average reader like myself, it is far too detailed and laborious.  There is very little entertainment value in the discussions that surround the occasional revelations.  My suggestion:  Read the abbridged version.
B0001CCXZW|5.0|Television shows are tricky. Some of them get better with time, until reaching their climax, and it's downhill from there. The X Files is an example of that. Others begin greatly, but then are never able to reach that peak again. Gilmore Girls is one of those cases. The first season is gold, definitely one of the best seasons of a tv series. There's an intimist atmosphere, the characters are nice, even the two protagonists, and you can relate to them. The balance between drama and comedy, and between common and weird, is flawless. And the fact that Rory is considered the perfect kid is not yet annoying, since she's  cool. Combining that with a great soundtrack and a finale that wraps everything up nicely, and here's all you need about Gilmore Girls.<br />Unfortunately, it was never this way again. The second season is still very good, despite being irregular, and even if it introduces the love triangle from hell. Jess was an interesting character, even with the clichés, and had good chemistry with Rory. But season 3 started to take this show down the hill, and it still hasn't recovered. Actually, since the creator doesn't seem to acknowledge what's wrong with it, it's hard to believe that it ever will. Having this season at home is a good way to relive its best moments and try to figure out what went wrong.
B00003CXUM|5.0|This is a love story set in China in the early 1960's. A man and woman are neighbours and discover that their spouses are having an affair. They meet to discuss, to commiserate, to comfort but finally fall in love. They don't want to be like their partners though. The movie is about passion, but also about restraint - how love can make us not act, rather than act. The scenes are beautifully shot, the costumes stunning and with the wet streets, the slow pacing and Nat King Cole singing Spanish in the background you are transported to another time. Often it felt more like an Italian film of the early 60's than a Chinese film made just last year. It is layered and rich in content and style.I have watched the DVD five or six times already and still discover more nuances with each viewing.<br />The Criterion Collection two-disc DVD is what DVD's are really meant to be. The making of featurette and the deleted scenes allow even deeper insights into an already intriguing film. I especially enjoyed the interviews with Maggie Cheung and Tony Leung at the Toronto Film Festival - you can really appreciate the charm of these two very talented actors.<br />This is a DVD to be enjoyed again and again.  It is the gem in my DVD library.
B000002KOO|5.0|Yes, this album is from their classic line-up.  Everything on this is great, if a little slow (Closing My Eyes).<br />Of course, that's what makes it so great.  Green's emotional side. Some classic FM tracks here though such as Oh Well (the full version) and Rattlesnake Shake.<br />This is the first album to get if you want to hear the band in it's old days.  Then search out The Blue Horizons Box set as well as the outtakes discs that are out.
B000001EXR|4.0|Well if KISS was to go on with this line-up, the music on this album would have in my opinion put them in the right direction for the future to come. It's a very dark and heavy album, nothin' like KISS ever made. But it doesn't surprise me that the did it cuz they have an act to do almost everything they set their minds to. Eric Singer is truly a brilliant drummer and the foundation he lays down here are spectacular. Bruce Kulick is an excellent guitar player which he has proven through out his carrer in KISS. As for the songs and music, it really sets the standard from the first song on with the track &quot;Hate&quot; here is a dept that we never before seen, &quot;Jungle&quot; also a track that actually got some air play on the radio and it's also a very dark and heavy track sung by Paul. But in my honest opinion is that nothin' and I mean nothin' comes even close to the track &quot;Childhoods End&quot;. It's one of the best songs that I've heard Gene do in a very long time. The song has it all great lyrics, a hard driven beat, a massive bridge and a killer chorus and to top if of, an outro with a childrens choir that knocks you straight to the ground. This album may not be a classic KISS album, but it has some really good songs on it.
B000002KGT|5.0|After the success of Fleetwood Mac, and soap opera material to work with, Rumours is the pinnacle of Fleetwood Mac's success.<br />Great tunes all around, all a classic.  Even Silver Springs - a b-side not originally on the album, has become a classic!<br />All band memembers are in top form instrumentally and vocally.<br />No need to go track by track on each song, but just know that this is the first Fleetwood Mac album to get when first getting into the band.<br />A+++
B000001EL7|5.0|Love Gun produced by the brilliant Eddie Kramer is a truly awesome album in so many ways. The sound is really fresh and after &quot;Destroyer&quot; KISS proves that they still got the ways for makin' yet another masterpiece. Right from the start with the first song &quot;I Stole Your Love&quot; KISS shows right there n' then why they're the biggest thing in rock n' roll and all the members gets a say with this one. Peter Criss leads the way with his poundering drum intro on the title track. This is also the song where Paul Stanley  shows how good he is as a composer and a singer. On the track &quot;Shock Me&quot; Ace gets to show himself as a singer for the first time and it gets clear that the man not only can play guitar. Gene as always makes a firm apperance with two great songs &quot;Almost Human&quot; and &quot;Plaster Caster&quot;(The later one prehaps self experienced?;). All in all, if you don't have this one in your collection even thou your not a KISS fan, you should check it out, you will not regret it.
B000002L9Y|4.0|This album has it's ups and downs. Certainly it has some great songs on it, but it hasn't aged very well IMO.<br />It is the peak of FM's 80's period and the first album where their sound changed from a nice warm sound to the cheesy '80s sound full of synths and electronics.  Not that it's a bad thing but hearing it today, it sounds outdated.  <br />But after the hits, there are some good tracks here like Family Man, Caroline, the title track, and Isn't It Midnight.<br />It is a good album, but that 80's sound makes it sound outdated and not Fleetwood Mac's style that I came to know and love.
B00005BF9Z|4.0|I first picked up this album after I saw Manu in concert in northern Italy. I have to say, it is one of the more heavily listened to albums in my collection. Having not known anything about him before I saw him, this album was an absolute delight. The only thing I can really compare it to is the European version of the band 'Sublime', except with more Latin/Mariachi influence. This album has everything - you can dance to it, chill out with it, or anything in between. Be cautioned though - if you buy it you will probably feel an irresistible urge to move to the Spanish coast.
B000002KXO|4.0|I call Mirage a middle of the road album.  There is certainly some great tracks here in addition to the hits &quot;Hold Me&quot; and &quot;Gypsy&quot; such as &quot;Love In Store&quot;, &quot;Eyes of The World&quot;, &quot;Can't Go Back&quot;, &quot;Book of Love&quot;, and &quot;Only Over You&quot;, but the rest IMO is forgettable.<br />The one from FM's glory years to get last.
B00005K3OT|5.0|As a Catholic, I viewed this movie somewhat differently than a few other reviewers here.<br />As the movie opened, we see this little French town that is not so much &quot;sleepy&quot; (a word commonly used to describe little backwater hamlets) as it is just plain tired: There is no joy of the Lord in this place, no delight in worshiping Him. Everything is done not for the spiritual pleasure of serving the Lord or out of a sense of duty to the One Who died for us, but rather to keep from being frowned at by the rigid, uptight Comte. I mean, who are the people supposed to be serving? The Comte or the Christ?<br />Enter Viane, who has some Issues. She is headstrong and defiant, a person who has made mistakes and missteps in her life. But she is not a bad person -- she's just....lost. But in this little French village, she seems to find what she's been looking for. Love. A sense of place. Some stability for herself and her daughter. Some good, strong friends. In the beginning, she helps them get on their feet -- in the end, they help her regain her own footing.<br />The whole village changes. They stop being so hidebound, so morose, so dull and lacking in love. They begin to experience joy. The bossy Comte is taken down a peg or two and becomes, actually, a likeable person. The young priest asserts himself as the spiritual leader of his parish. The one utterly benighted villager is banished. Several marriages are strengthened and two matches are made, one being Viane and her river rat. Viane's daughter is finally feels peace and security and her kangaroo can hop away.<br />My question about this movie is this: If you don't have a loving, forgiving heart, does it really matter if you don't eat chocolate during Lent? To obey is better than sacrifice, the Holy Word tells us. Jesus Himself called the Pharisees who stuck to the letter of the law, yet had no love in their hearts &quot;whited sepulchers, polished and beautiful on the outside, but on the inside full of dead men's bones.&quot;<br />This movie, this fairy tale-in-cinema, shows how Viane and this village wake up to what is real about God and His love for us. The movie ends at the very beginning of their pilgrimage. I hope they all found their way of rest and peace inside His Sacred Heart.n's bones.&quot;<br />This movie, this fairy tale-in-cinema, shows how Viane and this village wake up to what is real about God and His love for us.

B000002KD5|5.0|With the addition of Stevie Nicks and Lindey Buckingham after Bob Welch's departure, Fleetwood Mac skyrocket to the top with their self-titled album - more commonly known as the White Album.<br />Hits such as Rhiannon, Say You Love Me, and Over My Head helped to make this album a keeper.  But that's not all - every song on this album is a gem and I tend to prefer it over Rumours.  Songs like Landslide, World Turning, Monday Morning, and I'm So Afraid have become Fleetwood Mac classics.<br />An A++ album and the 2nd to get from the Fleetwood Mac collection.
6305903182|5.0|ok so Scream 3 isnt the same inspired thrill ride that the first two were but belive me this is still a heart pounding, shocking, scary, freaky and emotional thrill-ride. Once again our ghost masked killer is back for some more, but this time he quite happly tell all the potential victims what hes going to do and how hes going to do it as well. From what they can figure out the killer is slicing people up in the order they die in Stab 3 (the third movie about the woodsboro murders)One of my personal faviourite scenes is when all the victims are stuck in a house while the killer is faxing bits of the script, while the actors are frantically trying to read the faxs there getting. I did find that this film is more energetic than the others in the trilogy. The whole feel of this film is actually more grown up, I think that one of the most extremely inspired murders is when Posey Parker gets stuck behind a wall of mirrors as the killer trying to slice her up to shreds, but dewey and sydney can hear her but cant see her.<br />Ithink that the ending deserves a paragraph to its self as it's what really makes this film as inspired as it is, I was a fan of the ending on number one but really hated number two as to me it just seemed really silly and completely unrelavent to the plot. This ending is real white knuckle stuff, there secret passages miror walls secret doors and much more Sydney gets beaten around so much that you really truly start to think that she could lose this battle and she very nearly does, the ending is very stylishly done with progectors and mobiles and guns and knives, you really start to feel the desperation that sydney is going through. you also feel sorry for Gail and Dewey as they frantically try to get to there friend.<br />All in all this film is one hell of an ending to a truly inspiring horror trilogy that will stay in peoples memorys forever and we can all just be glad that it didnt spiral into endless sequels that shouldnt even of been made unlike some horror series<br />The scariest scream is always the last
B00006879E|5.0|This is one of the best CDs I've heard in a long while.  These funky songs with edgy lyrics keep you humming them all day long.  Maroon 5 had me listening with \\"Harder to Breathe\\" and I was hooked by the time I got to \\"This Love\\" and \\"Not Coming Home\\". If you're someone who appreciates different types of music then this is the CD for you. They successfully juxtapose different genres of music into one great album. It is worth every cent you pay for.
B00006879E|5.0|This is an awesome album. With the soulful sound styling of greats like Stevie Wonder and the &quot;good&quot; Michael Jackson, fused with the pop attitude of many boybands, and then fused with rock rythms, Maroon5 make a legendary contribution to the music industry. I just hope this band can stick together and stay original. I also hope that this awesome music isn't copied and therefore ruined.
B00006879E|5.0|this is the best CD I' ve eva heard in my life, you will have to love it. Outkast,Eminem, R. Kelly, Chingy, Ludachris, and Staind have nothing on this album. this album is an instant classic.On your first listen you will feeel 4 or 5 songs and on your second listen you'll feel all 12. It is incredible.You,ve got to buy this if you like music
B00009TB5G|5.0|This Movie was so cool!I really loved John Rhys-Davies and Orlando Bloom in this movie.They are so funny.Even though this film is not exactly like the book it's still good.I loved the battle of Helms Deep that was really cool!Viggo Mortenson was so good as Aragorn.I really like the love story between him and Arwen,it is so sweet.This movie had great special effects;I loved those wolf things,they were really cool.And Andy Serkins was so good as Gollum.All the Hobbits rocked;especially Billy Boyd as Pippen.You should really watch this movie.
0385504209|1.0|I suppose if you have read 2 books in your life, one was the Da Vinci Code and the other one was, I dunno, let's say Nancy Drew and the Hidden Decoder Ring, well then I guess DVC might be the best book that you have ever read.<br />Sorry to sound so condescending, but Dan Brown started it. The Da Vinci Code is juvenile level writing.  At least Carolyn Keene never pretended to be anything more than pure pulp entertainment for the preteen set.<br />If you are under the age of 13 or have nostagia for the days when a good mystery required minimal brain effort, then this Code's for you.
B00005JMTQ|2.0|It's Carrie and Big, 20 years later. <br />It's a 2-plus hour movie that needed to be 1-1/2 hours. While MONSTER has one writer and director and was tight as a drum, this movie has one writer and director who is self-indulgent. A waste of talent. OK if you have nothing better to do. Or see MONSTER and the finest acting I can remember ever seeing.
B000002GD9|5.0|I bought &quot;Even in the Quietest Moments&quot; before I had ever heard anything else by Supertramp. Now, I have 8 albums...yes vinyl albums. This album means SO much to me....&quot;Downstream&quot; is VERY special to me and a life-long friend....she thinks it's our life story, even tho we aren't married to each other. And &quot;From Now on&quot;is so sad.....<BR>This is probably my all time favorite album......
B0000CABJ1|4.0|I must say the sound quality on this cd is superb. Im only giving the greatest hits 4 stars only because this is the like the millionth greatest hits collection from Donna and its the same old songs. 5 stars to the new songs on the collection though. The only reason I bought it was I got a christmas gift certificate from best buy, so thought why not. If you dont have any of her greatest hits, this one is ok, All songs are radio edits though. Too bad theres not a radio edit of you are so beautiful, but the song is good anyway. I will live for love is a another good one and the other new one is so so to me.
0375432302|3.0|I enjoyed this book immensely.  I found myself thinking Ludlum in places and Agatha Christie in others.  The plot starts with a bang and twists and turns all the way to the very end.  Da Vinci Code is a very engaging mystery.<br />And, the mystery can only be solved by following a trail of clues involving very interesting history. An outstanding idea!!  From art (Da Vinci!!) to the Catholic Church, the trail winds, twists and surprises.<br />However, I would have enjoyed Da Vinci Code a good deal more if that history had not been so distorted.  Brown uses real events.  But, he often gives less than accurate -- to state it kindly -- accounts of the events.  For example, the account given of the Council of Nicea is ludicisously inaccurate.  The Council of Nicea is well documented and bears no resemblance to Brown's tale.<br />Brown's distorted history took a great deal of the fun out of the story.  The Catholic Church has plenty to choose from when it comes to embarrasing history.  With so much to choose from -- why make things up?  Perhaps his changes to history are just one more puzzle to be solved in the Da Vinci Code. Now, wouldn't that be a cool twist!!<br />I gave this 3 stars because it is an excellent and engaging 5 star read but, only a 1 star history.
B0001CCXZW|5.0|Finally Gilmore Girls is going to be out on DVD!!!  This rocks soooo much!! Gilmore Girls is an awsome show!!!
B000067CPX|5.0|Many are already aware of the much-deserved critical acclaim \\"By the Way\\" has received. It's a shame that the red hot chili peppers' most melodic and beautiful album has not been accepted with the same enthusiasm by pepper fans. Many pepper fans complain that the album lacks the intensity of previous pepper albums such as Californication and Blood Sugar Sex Magic. While the peppers have traded in some of the funk, they have replaced it with a musical experience that is surprisingly beautiful and oftentimes awe-inspiring. This album is a shining declaration that the peppers are growing tremendously as musicians. Kiedis' voice has never sounded better and his lyrics have matured in their artistry. Bassist Flea is branching out from his slap-bass ferocity and shows off his musicianship and gift for melody. Drummer Chad Smith has also seemed to embrace this new musical growth but, like the rest of the band, shows he can still rock in songs like \\"By the Way\\" and \\"Throw Away Your Television\\". But, by far, the most impressive display of musicianship is from John Frusciante. He has added impressive keyboard work and hauntingly beautiful harmonies to his already-impressive guitar playing which, by the way, is exhibited more beautifully and layered than ever before. He proves he is the great guitarist, and perhaps musician, of our time. This album shows how the peppers are growing and aging gracefully. It is not a slap in the face to previous peppers classics. It is just a step in a new and welcome direction, a direction that was hinted at in previous songs like \\"scar tissue\\" and \\"otherside\\". Embrace the growth, enlarge your musical experience, and buy this album.
0446310786|5.0|To Kill a Mockingbird by Harper Lee is one of the best books that I have ever read. It is the perfect description of how the white people living in the south treated the blacks in the 1930's. In school we learn about the slaves and the Civil War, and what goes on in that time period of American History. However we are not really exposed to the time period that follows, the fact is that we still treated blacks badly. Within the contents of this book about a little girl growing up in a very judgemental town we not only learn about how the blacks were treated but we also learn how judge some one. Which we really can't do until we walk around in their shoes. <BR>     When one takes the time to sit down and think about what is going on the fact that not a lot has changed since then. We make up stories about something or someone that we don't know, or are afraid of like Boo Radley. Then we frown down apon those who we think are unclean in our society like the Eweles. Then there are the people who we judge too qickly because of their unfasionalble clothes or the color of their skin like the Tom Robinson's of the world. When we decide to look closer we see that most of the Tom Robinsons of the world are just trying to get along like everyone else. People like Boo Radley are also trying to get by, but remain in the shadows, like the kid in the back of the class who doesn't say anything for the fear that everyone will laugh at him. Then the Eweles who we think to be unclean, but there is always the idea that we raise the standards all the time to what is fit in society. Then there is the dissaproval of a black man and a white woman back then, do we not today frown apon the realtionships of lesbians and gay people?<BR>    In To Kill a Mockingbird it takes a little girl to get us to realize this. She is only 6, shouldn't these societal conflicts be appearant to all. Esepcially the older ones who tend to be the cause of these confilcts. I ask of all who read this review, To Killa Mockingbird is a great book on its' own, but what makes it better is that there is so much more beyond it that can help us in all days of life.
B0000025P9|4.0|While definitly Toto's best work ever, this CD falls short of perfection by three or four tracks.  &quot;Rosanna,&quot; &quot;Make Believe&quot;, &quot;I won't Hold you Back&quot;, and &quot;Africa&quot; all excell, and are worth the hype.  &quot;Good For You&quot; and &quot;We Made It&quot; would be decent songs, but they are a bit too sugary for repeated listens. &quot;It's a feeling&quot; and &quot;Waiting for your love&quot; would be decent songs, but they sound a tad uninspired, especially when comparing them with such material as &quot;Rosanna&quot; and &quot;Africa.&quot; &quot;Afraid of Love&quot; and &quot;Lovers in the Night&quot; are just pure drek.
B00005JM20|2.0|I like Rowan Atkinson and have enjoyed him in various movies, Bean, Rat Race and in his series The Black Adder but this movie is really bad.  I didnt laugh during the entire movie but I did fall asleep three times while watching it (rewatched the parts that I missed when I awoke).  He's trying to be another Peter Sellers but is nowhere is good as Sellers was (who in my opinion wasnt all that funny either.)  I definitely wouldnt recommend this movie Rowan has been much funnier then this in the past (bad script).
B00005JM02|4.0|This video is great for kids, and the animation is simply excellent.<br />However, the story gets boring after a while and some of the parts are rather corny. Yet another Disney movie brainwashing kids about moral ideas such as love and trust... not that that's a bad thing... but this movie displays those morals in a corny, sappy way that will make you want to sink into your seat and will embarrass you. That's why the point was lost.<br />But generally it was fantastic and extremely funny. It was meant for kids, and serves its purpose well... even though I'm a teenager and enjoyed it.
B000069AUI|5.0|I own thousands of CDs, but this is first time that I have written a review.  After a year of listening to this CD, it still just amazes me.  Every song is it's own unique masterpiece, and it far exceeds the quality of Parachutes.  Can't wait to hear their next studio recording, it will be hard to live up to this one though.  <br />If you are looking for good CDs to add to your collection, whether it is big or small, this is a must have.  Check out John Mayer's &quot;Room For Squares&quot; and the equally excellent &quot;Heavier Things&quot; too!
B00006FDCD|2.0|This wasn't an utter failure, but some of the &quot;scary&quot; parts made me laugh. Like the scene with Eddie in the shower, and the clown coming up from the drain. I suppose it would have been scarier had I been alone in the house at night or something... but I had been expecting a lot worse after reading the book, It by Stephen King, which remains my favorite book of all time. Perhaps I was laughing out of desperation for some enjoyment in life after this mediocre performance of the book I love. Not terrible, but not really worth it unless you're truly interested.
B000002TQV|5.0|Without question, the greatest album of the 90's.  I wouldn't go so far as to place it in the company of The Beatles, &quot;Sgt. Peppers&quot; or Rolling Stones' &quot;Exile on Main St,&quot; because of their affect on pop culture.  But, that doesn't take anything away from an album that would be used as a Case Study for Alternative Music 101.  <br />Unlike albums such as Pearl Jam's &quot;10&quot; or Nirvana's &quot;Nevermind,&quot; this will take you on an emotional journey from track #1 to track #12.  Highlights include &quot;Planet Telex&quot; which leads off the record, and will confuse those who haven't really experienced Radiohead's music. Stick with it.  &quot;The Bends&quot; is guitar crashing melodies, with Thom Yorke's rapid fire wails complimenting perfectly.  &quot;High and Dry&quot; is a pop-acoustic number, that would probably find its way on a Dawson's Creek or Felicity Soundtrack.  &quot;Fake Plastic Trees&quot; is what it is.  The lyrics may not make sense, if you read them off a sheet of paper.  But in the context of this song, they fit perfectly, in a melancholy display of raw emotion and intensity.  &quot;Black Star&quot; is a similar type of track, in regards to emotion,intensity, and aura.  Those two tracks are worth the purchase price alone.  Hidden gems like the mayhem of &quot;Just&quot; and the etherial &quot;Bullet Proof&quot; add to the excellence of this album.<br />Note: Although some postings will suggest that pound for pound &quot;OK Computer&quot; is the best Radiohead record, or &quot;Hail to the Thief&quot; which is their newest release, be careful.  For those not used to listening to Radiohead, those two albums may be difficult to get or understand.  Start with &quot;The Bends&quot; and move onto &quot;OK Computer.&quot;
0451169514|5.0|There is no book like It which combines horror, suspense, thrill, as well as deep psychological reasoning and intense character development. This book is everything you would ever want in a novel. Just don't read it when you're alone.
B000069AUI|4.0|This is an excellent follow up to Parachutes, and is a much more complete album.  While Parachutes has more to offer in timeless singles, such as &quot;Yellow&quot; and &quot;Shiver,&quot; A Rush of Blood to the Head is more consistent with quality track after track. <br />&quot;Warning Sign&quot; is probably the closest thing to &quot;Yellow&quot; on this album, and is a worthy follow up.  &quot;The Scientist&quot; and &quot;Green Eyes&quot; are acoustic piano/guitar numbers, that capture the essence of what makes Chris Martin and Coldplay so popular.  The omnipresent &quot;Clocks&quot; is an overplayed, but valuable addition, as well as &quot;In My Place.&quot;  Hidden gems like &quot;Amsterdam&quot; will keep this album in your mp3/CD player for months.
B00009TB5G|5.0|A fantastic performance. The photography was superb, as was the music and the acting. I have no complains. See this movie, even if you haven't read the book (as I hadn't when I first saw it). It's worth it. But pay attention because the story can escape your concentration sometimes while you're gawking about all other fantastic aspects of the film.
B00000DP01|3.0|Original lead guitarist Anthony Phillips had left Genesis after the &quot;Trespass&quot; album, and the band also wanted to upgrade their drummer situation. They settled on Flaming Youth drummer and former child actor Phil Collins and neophyte guitarist Steve Hackett. The album that resulted, 1971's &quot;Nursery Cryme&quot;, had a harder sound than &quot;Trespass&quot;, with fewer overdubs and solid production by John Anthony. The downside is that &quot;Nursery Cryme&quot; has the weakest set of songs of any Genesis album from the '70s. Keyboardist Tony Banks hit the nail on the head, saying in Armando Gallo's &quot;I Know What I Like&quot; book that &quot;we seemed to be a bit lacking in material. I think that 'Musical Box' and 'Salmacis' are the two songs that sort of carry that album.&quot;<br />&quot;The Musical Box&quot; is the standout track, a 10-minute piece that alternates loud and quiet passages, climaxing with Banks' best guitar-playing moment, as he trades leads with Hackett, and also slips in a quick electric piano solo. The album closes strong with &quot;The Fountain of Salmacis&quot;, which tells the Greek mythological tale of Hermaphroditus, who was turned into the first...well, you know. In between are a couple more long songs and three short pieces that are all pleasant, but are a tier below Genesis' usual level. &quot;The Return of the Giant Hogwood&quot; is a sci-fi epic reminiscent of &quot;The Day of the Triffids&quot;, with evil plants out to take over the Earth. &quot;Seven Stones&quot; is the weakest track, and a truly strange choice for the single. The short songs include the silly, upbeat &quot;Harold the Barrel&quot; and ballads &quot;Harlequin&quot; and &quot;For Absent Friends&quot;. The latter was Collins' first lead vocal for Genesis. This is a 3-1/2 star album.<br />(1=poor 2=mediocre 3=pretty good 4=very good 5=phenomenal)
B00003CXI1|4.0|While it could have been better, Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone on screen is not bad. There are many things to complain about, such as mediocre acting and poor directing; but generally the movie stayed true to the book and as an introduction to what will probably be seven Harry Potter movies, it serves pretty well. The star was lost for the plain old movie messups, which has nothing to do with JK Rowling at all.

B00005K3NR|5.0|The acting in this movie is good, and the plot stays true to the book, more or less. Sissy Spacek does an excellent job at playing Carrie, the scapegoat of all the students in Chamberlain and the telekinetic girl whose powers destroy the town forever.<br />For an old horror movie, Carrie is well done and will produce the same emotions inside you as the book did, which is mostly sadness, and some horror. The story is unforgettable and classic. There is absolutely nothing like it.<br />I especially loved the scene when Chris and Billy try to crash their car into Carrie and she sets the car on fire with her eyes. I don't necessarily like that scene because of the violence, but I think it was very well done and very much reminiscent of the book.<br />Carrie's mother and Miss Desjardin could have been played differently, because they weren't exactly what I saw in the characters when I read the book. But I'm not complaining. Generally the acting was very good.<br />All the scenes evoked emotion just like the book and since that's the most important thing to me in a movie version, I'm happy with it.
B00005T343|2.0|This is an uneven movie. It almost works. The atmosphere and music are intriguing and adequate, some moments are visually stunning and a few thrills truly engage and surprise. However, the rythm of the narrative is too slow and the plot is basically just another cat-and-mouse game with an anticlimatic ending that`s way too out there and doesn`t connect with the rest of the movie. Anthony Hopkins is again a convincing Hannibal Lecter but Julliane Moore plays an uninteresting, bland Clarice Starling that shows little sparkle. There are some genuine moments of tension and suspense to find here, though as a whole it`s too flawed and not very captivating. The baroque feel is an edgy and well-accomplished idea, creating some tension, darkness and weirdness that unfortunately don`t work very well in the end. This movie wants to be a rich banquet, yet ultimately is just another happy meal. Tasty enough, but leaves you wantig more.
B00008DDXC|3.0|This movie is an enaction of JK Rowling's novel, which happens to be one of my favorite books of all time. Naturally I'm very critical, but even a non-critical person who has read Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets knows that this movie isn't everything it could be. The acting is mediocre and the special effects aren't up to scratch. Even the way the plot moves along is unnatural - Chris Columbus tries way too hard to include everything from the book, which, of course, is impossible. No scene is concentrated on well and nothing is really excellent, more like the whole movie is equally mundane.<br />Not to say that it's a bad movie. I enjoyed it a lot and it was entertaining. Much of it was funny. But one star was taken for the poor acting and other movie conditions, and the other is for the director's choice of how to run the scenes.
6303036570|3.0|This engaging and underrated drama from Brian De Palma tells the somewhat familiar but interesting story of Carlito (Al Pacino), an ex-con who tries to give his life a meaning and therefore avoids some earlier behaviours and habits. However, obstacles came across as his old \\"friends\\" get on his way creating a couple of difficult, tension-filled situations. Despite the predictability of the plot in some moments, this is still a very solid movie with a bunch of intriguing and moving scenes. Also, Sean Penn plays an unusual character worth taking a look at.
B00005JLYW|4.0|the story expanded on the angels lives... and openned the doors to the past of some of the characters.  I thought the continuation of the &quot;thin assassin's story&quot; was a good addition although how it fits the story isn't exactly seamless.  All in all not half so bad a movie
B000020617|2.0|The third Foo Fighters album is a well produced product that isn`t bad enough to be repulsive neither too interesting or solid to be considered good. It ends up being an average,decent-but-nothing-special record, that still is better than most of the stuff on the radio. Most of the songs here are alright and amusing, however they lack complexity and sound too poppy and predictable, never leaving familiar ground. It isn`t too risky or innovative, even if some moments, like &quot;Generator&quot;, are worth a listen. All in all, &quot;There Is Nothing Left To Lose&quot; is another presentable rock album with a few nice songs and a lot of filler material. It could have been worse.
B00000IBRX|5.0|While the entire suicide theme is a bit controversial, I have to say that this was an excellent film.  It had such depth and pulled at the core of our emotions.  It left us realizing that suicide truly is not the correct choice.  There is always hope in life.  Robin Williams went out on a limb with this film, but I believe it was a courageous choice as it will help heal many lives.
B00005RYP9|1.0|This is supposed to be an artsy movie about the yakuzas and their activities in America. However, it`s not more than an average, empty thriller that`s neither exciting nor funny, let alone creative or original. Takeshi Kitano, who both directs the picture and plays its asian main character, is devoid of charisma while he acts, using the same facial expression the whole time. There are lots of useless moments of pointless violence here, which try to have style and edgyness but fail miserably (Tarantino does it much better). &quot;Brother&quot; is a tedious, unengaging waste of time and is quickly forgotten. Meaningless.
0385335482|5.0|When I first saw this book in Barnes and Noble, I knew it was for me. With its pink cover (I bought the small paperback version) and the word &quot;shop&quot; in its title, I fell in love with Becky (who shares the same name as me, incidentally!) immediately. Even though many say Becky's attempts to crawl out of her deep self-dug whole of debt are annoying, I say everyone has a little bit of a shopaholic inside them. A real easy and witty read, &quot;Confessions of a Shopaholic&quot; is the perfect match for any girl obsessed by the shopping world. Sophie Kinsella deserves every good review she gets.
B000006NPY|5.0|Every Smashing Pumpkins` record is good, most are great but this is probably their best. Here, the band leaves behind the grabbing and intense rock songs that led them to fame and chooses a new, gloomier, atmospheric direction. It`s not an easy area to enter, since this is an absorbing, emotionally-charged and deep album that takes awhile to discover and appreciate.<br />\\"Adore\\" is a collection of dark lullabies, a powerful document of the bands` genius and strenght. There`s not a band song here and each is a great, unsettling moment that combines both beauty and despair. In fact, this effort has more melancholy and infinite sadness than their previous record, offering subtle and introspective moments that perfectly mix the acoustic and the electronic elements. <br />The song structures are rich and complex, the lyrics remain as good as ever and Billy Corgan`s voice sounds fragile and wounded without reaching a melodramatic or sappy level. The album has a gothic feel, full of stories that focus loneliness, lost love, disillusion and are perfect to listen to at night or on a rainy day.<br />It`s unfortunate that so many people, especialy fans of the band, hated \\"Adore\\" when it came out, since it`s one of the best records of the nineties full of well-written and seductive songs, offering an unique mood that lacks in so many albums out there today. <BR>A masterpiece.
B00006LLNU|5.0|Sigur Ros is a very ambient and spacy band. They make some great ballads, and they also make some really weird ambiences with their instruments. What I like about the album is that the songs are untitled, there's a balance between light and dark, and the reverby feel of the songs. Track 1, 2, 3, 6, and 8 are my favorites. Really good album.
B0000DD7LB|5.0|This is a great album! I am actually suprised at how good it is. I'm a Britney fan, but I didnt rush out to get it because <BR>although &quot;Me against the music&quot; is a good song, it didnt make me want the album that much. Well, when &quot;TOXIC&quot; came out, I was like &quot;THIS IS THE BEST SONG EVER&quot;, ok so not really, but &quot;Toxic&quot; is a great song and thats what made me really want to go out and buy the album.<BR>My fave songs on the album are:<BR>(I got that) Boom Boom featuring the Ying Yang Twins<br />Breathe on me-cool song<BR>Early Mornin'-AMAZING SONG! MOBY DID A GREAT JOB!<BR>Toxic-OMG!!!! THIS SONG IS SO GOOD AND THE VIDEO IS HOT!<BR>Outrageous-really fun 2 sing along 2<BR>The hook up-LOVE IT! I like the reggae beats, its hot.<BR>Brave new girl-Good song.<BR>Everytime-Showcases Britney's vocal ability and I think its an answer to Justin's &quot;Never again&quot; from his album &quot;Justified&quot; (Which is another album I also highly reccomend).<br />Some people who have written reviews for this album just write &quot;Britney sucks&quot;, &quot;She cant sing&quot; blah blah. Trust me, 95% of these people who are writing these NEGATIVE reviews havent even listened to the album. IF YOU ARE GOING TO REVIEW THE ALBUM, LISTEN TO IT AT LEAST ONCE, OTHERWISE YOU ARE NOT GIVING A FAIR REVIEW!!!<br />This is Britney's best album by far. I hope she continues to grow as an artist and show the world that she CAN sing. GOOD JOB BRITNEY!

6305428271|5.0|I, actually go to Carlmont High School in Northern California right now.  Carlmont is the school in which this movie is based on.  I had always heard from parents who attended Carlmont back when it was much different, and it was hard for me to believe that my school could have been so terrible.  After I saw Dangerous Minds which was made about the directors experience at Carlmont high school, I am shocked.  It's hard to believe that there was so much violence and drugs.  Nowadays Carlmont still has those factors, yet it is improved greatly.  The school in the movie is absolutely nothing like it is today.  I'm glad for the improvement!
B000066NW0|5.0|Okay, at first I only got the CD 'cause I liked a couple of the songs. However when I listened to the whole thing through, I got ssoooo addicted. I absolutely LOVE it!! And I don't see the sense in why some of you think she's a poser. Is being who you are and not caring what others think posing? I think not, unless the meaning of &quot;poser&quot; has drastically changed (which it hasn't). I applaud Avril for being who she is, because THAT is something to admire.
0792842499|5.0|This movie is the best western movie ever made.
B00009W0WM|5.0|We all know that CASABLANCA is a uniquely great film.<br />Now it is available in a restored edition that surpasses all expectations.  The film fairly glows with a pearly sheen and the sound is superb.  I was struck not only by previously invisible details, like the texture of the fabric of the costumes, but by subtleties of expression in the voices and faces of the actors.  These lend the drama a depth I had never seen in all my many previous viewings.<br />Highly recommended!  If you buy only one DVD of a classic film this should be the one.  (After seeing it, you'll want more!)
B00005JMGL|5.0|hey, this is one of the greatest movies that i have ever seen. it was the only movie that had me laughing and crying.plus the total babe jeremy sumpter was totally hot in it which makes it a bonus! ever since ive seen this movie i have done anything to see it again. so far i have seen it 3 times, in 2 weeks. i love it. plus i have already booked it for when it comes out on dvd. i cant wait. i totally recomend it to anyone that wants to laugh and cry.
B0000CEB62|3.0|All my friends wore black that day.  We were, oh so cool!  Juan was the coolest.  He kind of looked like Dave Gahan with beautiful dark skin, black really didn't become him.  Though you always wore black to a DM concert, unless you were a wannabe.  Then it started drizzling, the lights went down,  and the security gaurds wouldn't allow anyone to climb on the chairs.  That made us angry, so much so that our argueing with them made us miss the intro, which I caught later on the CD and the Film. Then Daveout ran  in white!  White!  How daring and innovative that was.  Then we forgot about the security gaurds, who also forgot about us.  We climbed on the chairs and sang our hearts out.  <br />We ran to buy the CD as soon as it was originally released and we went to the KROQ premier of the film.  Then they became huge, bigger than life.  No longer were they a band that only a few Angelinos listened to.  They had concerts afterwards, at Dodger Stadium, which sold several days, huge hits on top 40 radio, and caused a riot during their Violator album signing at Warehouse Records in Hollywood.  By then Juan no longer wore black, neither did I.  Atleast not fully dressed in black.   Our dark days were over, who would've known that DM's were just starting.  <br />As for the DVD, nothing could ever match the experience of being there, perhaps only the double CD.

B00006G8LB|4.0|James Cameron, the unsung movie director of Alien movie sequel - and who've made a major flash in the pan with the common popular shallow social market with the disappointing TITANIC (which could've done well to incorporate the mysteries within the legendary ships tragedy, than doing a love story schtick which cashes on the popularity of its stars (that the movie PEARL HARBOR gets its deserved bad-kharma by trying to incorporate its formula to sell from its movie theme song to plotlines and production patterns)) ~ was the one supposed to direct and script this movie, that fortunately enough director Sam Raimi who've done great work in his own right with the Evil Dead siries - being a fan himself came to the rescue, into near protests of Cameron's draft of idea for the film - that got Cameron sulked to create the non-notable tv siries Dark Angel. <BR>Raimi have done quite well in interpolating Spidey's origin story (first appearing in Amazing Adult Adventures # 15) where Peter learned of resposibility upon the death of his adaptive parent Uncle Ben with the Death of the original Green Goblin plotline (Amazing Spider-Man #'s 121 to 122) that could've been perfect enough (lotsa death- welp, the ingredient which makes an epic); if only they never rushed to pitt Mary Jane Watson in the part, where in the comic book Peter Paker (ie. SPIDEY himself) in this plotline have Gwen Stacy as his girlfriend instead, and Mary Jane was actually only just still around the background as Foster's best friend. The story goes that Goblin killed Gwen Stacy (issue # 121) and in the following episode of the comic book (#122), the lead was taken into the death of the Green Goblin. They should've opted to put Mary Jane as SPIDEY's leading lady for the sequel - which in fact would've given a good stretch for the movie indeed.<BR>If only the movie had never taken its shortcut, it could've been perfect.<br />I was first turned off when I heard its the-guy-with-Micahel-Douglas who'd play the partof Peter/Spiderman, but it turned out good. As for Kirsten Dunst as &quot;spiderman's b*tch&quot; (so'd the then- child actress have told David Letterman) - well, they coul've opted for someone else to've played the role of Mary Jane Watson.<br />The other turn off for me in the movie is the soundtrack and appearance of that forgettable pop singer - they could've really done better in this aspect (I's thinking of MN OIL, being that there've been rumours back in '78 to put their vocalist Peter Garrett in Spidey spandex costume (year that I got converted since to be a fan of Spide at six years old)). Good AEROSMITH theme rendition though.<br />And so we now come to its lurking sequel with the leering villain Doc Ock -- smells like romance for Pete's aunt ? We'll see, unless if they'd dodge that storyline as well. <br />Overall rating 9 out of 10
B00004T9UF|5.0|A very good album from Eminem. His best. Every track on this cd is awesome. With 2001's hit &quot;Real Slim Shady&quot;  this cd sold very good. Including other hits like &quot;Stan&quot; or &quot;The Way I Am&quot; or &quot;Criminal&quot; all in this album, this is one of the greatest cds of all time. Really nice beats, and if you don't have this cd, buy it sometime.<BR>Best songs:<BR>B**** Please II<BR>Stan<BR>Real Slim Shady<BR>Criminal
B00003ZKRM|5.0|I have this set of splendid Sibelius Symphonies for over a year now.I consider myself lucky to have stumbled upon choosing this set ahead of other more \\"Reputed\\"performances by TOP Orchestras under Great Conductors.I have been listening to this set for over a year and the least i can say is that it is nothing short of a Revelation.No other conductor or orchestra matches Sir John Barbirolli's understanding and Passionate intensity(sorry Eugene Ormandy,Leonard Bernstein,Mariss Janson)in these performances with the Halle Orchestra.The Halle Orchestra perform splendidly individually as well as collectively,The strings have an intensity ,the woodwinds have an ethereal character and the Brass are quite simply Majestic.Barbirolli brings out the Heroics,the passionate intensity,the poignance,the Mystical quality,the gay abandon and folklike singing quality in these marvellous orchestral works of Sibelius.The pacing is just right ,lingering in passages of great beauty like in the slow movement of the Fifth Symphony,moving with urgency when required.The music is ever flowing in a seamless way and not just pieced together with studied musicianship.The orchestra breathes a free air with an element of spontaneous music making.<BR>Remember how Bruno Walter turned out splendid performances of Beethoven and Brahms Symphonies with a handpicked Columbia sympony Orchestra!Quite the same here.I am yet to listen to Sir Colin Davis Boston Symphony Orchestra's Performances of these works.I am not sure whether they will measure upto this splendid performance by Sir John.It is not about efficiency or discipline.It is all about BEING INSPIRED!!!Sir John Barbirolli and his splendid Halle Orchestra Musicians are on a different plane,the rarefied realms of the spirit!Noble and Sublime.
B000002UB6|4.0|This album is somewhat problematic to review.  It may possibly be the Beatles worst album, but it is still better than most rock groups best albums.  It is sloppy and technically imperfect, but there are a lot of great songs here.  It features three genuine classic hits; \\"Let It Be\\", \\"The Long and Winding Road\\" and \\"Get Back\\".  The other songs are also good, with the possible exceptions of the tossed off \\"jams\\", \\"Dig It\\" and \\"Maggie May\\".  After the Beatles couldn't be bothered to finish this album, Phil Spector was brought in to work with the tapes.  He put together a rather schizophrenic album, with some songs left in their \\"rough\\" form, and some songs adorned with an orchestra and chorus.  Anyway, while the album is not a complete success, it is still a worthwhile purchase.
0385504209|4.0|Take a tablespoon of Edgar Allen Poe's \\"The Gold Bug,\\" add a dash of Kubrick's \\"Eyes Wide Shut,\\" and sprinkle in a dollop of Spielberg's \\"Raiders of the Lost Ark.\\"  Now stir well for some 400-plus pages, add Dan Brown's spicy research, and you've got the recipe for a tasty danged-gum souffl&eacute;.  Less filling, low-carb and it tastes great!<br />Again, the fun begins with a phone call to Robert Langdon.  There's a murder in the Louvre, strange ciphers, riddles pointing to hidden meanings in Leonardo Da Vinci's masterpieces - clues hidden and yet visible.  What does it all mean? The race is on to find the killer(s), solve the riddles and protect Christianity.  Can Langdon do it? You be the judge.<br /><br />The book itself rolls along solidly for about two-thirds of the way and it's a ripping good yarn.  (Trust me -- you will never, ever look at Da Vinci's \\"The Last Supper\\" with the same set of eyes after reading this book.)  The ending may not satisfy some readers and, indeed, the denouement seems forced and too open ended to suit me.  Brown wants to please everyone and the final third of the book is a bit of a cop-out.  (Brown also wants to set the stage for a follow-up book.  Duh.)<br />What fascinated me about the book was the fact that it's really one part of a Dan Brown/ Leonardo Da Vinci event.  There's this novel, of course.  Then there are at least two Websites devoted to puzzle solving, code breaking, riddle solving -- all leading to a better understanding of what Brown was about here.  (One of the Websites offers a chance for a trip to Paree if you solve the mysteries presented you.)  And, the book's dust jacket contains clues to help solve one of the Website's puzzlers.  This is terrific fun and I couldn't help getting caught up in it.<br />Dan Brown gets better with time.  The next Langdon piece should be a pip.  Can't wait!
B00006879E|5.0|Alright, I'm a regular rock music junkie. However, when I first recieved this CD from a friend, I listened to it once and suddenly fell in love with it! Every time I go to turn on my stereo, I HAVE to listen to this CD because I'm SOOOOOO addicted to it! My friends all think I'm quite odd because I'm SO into rock music, yet I am SO in love with this CD! I don't care about them though, it's my favorite CD and I'll stick to it, thank you very much! :-D
6302212529|5.0|While \\"Beauty and the Beast\\" may have nominated for BEST Picture, \\"The Lion King\\" may have captured the world's attention, and \\"Aladdin\\" may have soared with a Robin Williams-voiced genie, \\"The Little Mermaid\\" still stands as the landmark film that brought Disney animation to the forefront.<br />The first of the studio's modern-day musicals, \\"The Little Mermaid\\" has it all: a feisty heroine, a faithful mentor/protector, a slightly off-center sidekick, a hunky leading man, a Godlike father, and a villain at the peak of wickedness.<br />The vocal performances by Jodi Benson (\\"Ariel\\"), Kenneth Mars (\\"King Triton\\"), Samuel E. Wright (\\"Sebastian\\"), Buddy Hackett (\\"Scuttle\\") and Pat Carroll (\\"Ursula\\") are, without a doubt, the best ever heard in a Disney film.  Able-bodied vocal support is given by the always-dependable Rene Auberjoinois as a set-upon French chef.<br />The songs (\\"Under the Sea\\", \\"Part of Your World\\", \\"Poor Unfortunate Soul\\", \\"Kiss the Girl\\") are Broadway-worthy.<br />It's a shame that the film is not in circulation at the moment.  It is truly one in need of remastering and \\"special edition\\" status with extras.
0671027344|5.0|This book is one that can be related to by ANYONE, young or old.  Boy or girl The expearences that he goes through will be likened to anyone's life story.  I could not even think after finishing the book.  All that can be said is that it needs to be read.
0393317552|3.0|I will admit I haven't finished this book. I got to the epilogue conclusion, and summed it up in the second paragraph: nature, or rather where groups are on the earth, not nurture (intelligence). Interesting reading otherwise, but the author's causal connections between events tend to be tenuous and some research aspects could have used some deeper work to better build his case. Keeping this in mind, worth the money in my opinion.
0060012218|5.0|Geography Club is a wonderful, hopeful and non-offensive book for all kids and their families. It's the story of a group of very lonely kids in one school who decide to form a support group for gay and lesbian kids. Rather than label the group for what it is out of fear, the kids decided to call it The Geography Club. After all, what kid is going to have much interest in an after-school club supposedly studying maps of the world? There, in the privacy of a what they imagined would be considered a nerd club, the kids create a safe haven to discuss their identities.    Brent Hartinger does a laudable job of developing a story rich in unique an individual character. He does an excellent job in endeavoring to stress the importance of the individual student as opposed to the tried and less than true stereotypes that many hold of gay and lesbian people. The characters are quite delightful in their interactions and the scenarios that play out are quite believable.    Ultimately, Hartinger has developed a tremendously interesting social picture of all of the kids of groups that segment the average American high school.     Geography Club is a wonderful addition to the growing list of very hopeful books that have been emerging in support of gay and lesbian adolescents.     Kids who have different needs in schools often present the greatest challenge to our \\"one size fits all\\" model of education. Sadly, we have many kids with all kinds of different needs falling by the waysides of American Education.    As we appropriately stress the achievement of high academic standards in schools today, we cannot do so without also addressing the very human needs of many of the 'misfits\\" who don't feel very welcome in the very schools that expect them to demonstrate high academic achievement. I believe it's reasonable to assume we need to make kids safe and wanted before we can expect their best achievement. I hope that books like Hartinger's helps at least one kid feel a little more acceptable and understood.     High recommended.       Daniel  J. Maloney  Saint Paul, Minnesota USA
B0000DD7LB|3.0|From the innocent schoolgirl,to the wild girl shje is now, looks like Britney's done it again. following her 2001 release.'Britney',she's back with 'in the zone'-a collection of upbeat,fast tracks that will make you dance and snap your fingers. prior to it's title,'in the zone' really gets you in-the-zone. She calls this project her most personal one but i think,personal does not fit it. What im trying to say is 'in the zone' is just like its title...it doesnt make you cry or its not that uplifting..it just boosts up your energy to PARTY. She co-wrote a lot of songs in this album...so expect a lot of MUSH. its 12th cut,everytime is somethin i can compare to Evanesence' My Immortal bcoz of the part&quot;...your face,its haunting me...&quot; sounds like &quot;...your face it haunts my once pleasant dreams...&quot; and the piano's eerie. One cut that stands above the rest is TOXIC.(She didnt co-wrote this track...^^:) I dont know whats w/ this song!!! Everytime i listen to it,i feel like its intoxicating my systems!!Forcing me to DANCE plus the intro sounds a bit like Linkin Park's Faint. With an album like this with elements of Kylie Minogue and Madonna's Ray of Light(it's Bhangra...Ray of light has elements of Bhangra...),i think she doesnt deserve to be called the Pop Princess...i thin the title: DISCO QUEEN suits her.
B0000667RO|5.0|This is an essential buy whether you are a die hard Bryan Adams fan or not, it's a must for all music-lovers. Okay, I admit it's not as good as So Far So Good which has a better collection, but its still absolutely mindblowing! Besides, So Far So Good doesn't have &quot;Have you ever really loved a woman&quot; which happens to be my all-time favourite. I think all the songs are great, though I like &quot;Summer of '69 &quot;, &quot;Inside Out&quot; and &quot;I'm Ready&quot; the best. &quot;I'm Ready&quot; in particular, is spellbinding. Bryan's mesmerising voice, of course, adds to the beauty of all the songs and will leave the listener speechless. If your mind is oscillating as to whether you should buy this or not, go for it, without a second thought. It is, indubitably one of the best audios I have come across in a long time. It is the perfect blend of frothy songs like &quot;The Only Thing That Looks Good On Me&quot; and heartmelting ones like &quot; Have You Ever Really Loved a Woman&quot; and &quot;Cloud #9.&quot; The title track is also impressive. All in all &quot;Best of Me&quot; is truly a masterpiece, the true work of a GENIUS!!!!!
0425152251|4.0|Sophie's World, by Jostein Gaarder, brilliantly combines philosophy and the story of a curious teenage girl named Sophie, who opens up her mind to the vast world of philosophy around her. Gaarder explains theory in a way that makes the subject almost seem easy to understand, while covering the great philosophers such as Democritus, Socrates, Plato, Aristotle, Descartes, Darwin, Freud, and several other great world thinkers. At first, the book reads as a poor attempt at being a novel, when the author is actually using a fictional tale as an outlet to switch between past theories, and relate them to the present, Sophie's World.<BR> The book mixes creativity with intellect to help the reader visualize each concept. For example, Democritus' theory that the Lego is \\"the most ingenious toy in the world,\\" is explained using Sophie as a puppet who reads about this idea and pulls down her old legos from the top shelf. Not only does this explain the theory in depth, but the author finds a way to break philosophy down and apply each idea to our everyday lives.<BR> Gaarder also uses imagery to explain how philosophy got started. The narrator of the \\"philosophy lessons\\" explains Plato and Socrates' ideas on the world through a video filmed in Athens. He walks the camera through the Acropolis, around temples, one being the great Parthenon, past the Dionysus Theatre, and through the ancient city. Through detailed description, the reader gets a clear image of the town where philosophy began, and is able to visualize the beauty of Athens and the great orators in the streets teaching and debating the philosophies of life.<BR> Along with theory, the book covers history, which is a necessity in order to understand philosophy and the evolution of thought. Each chapter jumps from one philosopher to the next explaining how, when, and where each idea began. One interesting idea is \\"the collision between Greek Philosophy and the doctrine of Christian redemption\\" from the visit of the Pharisee Paul in Athens. Apparently, Paul came to the city and convinced the Athenian philosophers of Jesus' resurrection, which created a whole new perspective on things, and in a way, tied science and religion together. The Semites actually had a theory on history and how time works. Their theory was about this ongoing line (also known as history), created by god, that started at the creation of the world, and ended on what they called \\"Judgment Day,\\" the day that god judges the living and the dead, the day that all evil is destroyed. With this theory in mind, the Semites spent thousands of years recording history and it was these historical roots that \\"constitute the very core of their holy scriptures.\\"<BR> By the time I finished this incredibly informative book, I had a great understanding of each philosopher and their theories on life, and felt quite comfortable with the ideas that Gaarder explains. Having read Sophie's World, I now know about certain ideas that I have always been curious about, but would have never taken the time to research in depth. As well as educating myself on others theories, I began to develop some ideas of my own. Furthermore, Jostein Gaarder's masterpiece not only interested me, but it provided the stable information needed to write an essay, and possibly the inspiration to becoming a philosopher myself.

B00005JME0|5.0|I was expecting this film to be like most \\"time travel\\" movies and be horrendous.  It was surprisingly good!<br />Evan (played by Ashton Kutcher) had a rocky childhood where he had many blackout periods and where he couldn't remember what happened.  His father was in a mental institution for a similar problem (he had the blackouts as well).  He had some rough times with his friends, especially with siblings Tommy and Kaylie who had an abusive pedophile father.  The three of them, plus a friend named Lenny, tended to hang out together and get in trouble.  A couple particular events between the four of them end up scarring them all for life.<br />Cut to the present, Evan is a psych major at a university, Kaylie is a disturbed waitress at a diner, Tommy got out of juvenile hall and works in an auto shop and Lenny is bordering on insanity and still living with his mother.  Evan confronts Kaylie and tries to find out what happened during a particular blackout where the two of them were in her father's basement making a movie, when he blacks out and wakes up without his clothes on.  She is mentally disturbed by this and the next day commits suicide.<br />Evan is distraught over this and begins to read his journals that he's kept since he was a little kid.  He's reading about a particular event, then suddenly seems to be there reliving it.  He wakes up shaken with a bloody nose and a new scar.  He begins to realize that he can use his journals to go back to those blackout periods and can actually change what happened.  Once he changes one little thing, however, the butterfly effect takes over and EVERYTHING changes.  He keeps trying to change things to make everyone happy and things don't quite turn out like he hoped.<br />I thought the acting was superb.  I've never been a huge fan of Ashton Kutcher, but he did a great job in this film.  The other lead characters were also great, especially Amy Smart as Kaylie.  While any time travel movie will have to have some sort of fantasy element that doesn't make sense, this one tried to stay as close to the truth as possible.  If you change one thing in the past, EVERYTHING changes .. and not always for the better.  I also thought the conclusion to the film was phenominal.  I couldn't have thought of a better way to end it without becoming cheesy and ruining the entire movie.<br />Overall I'm giving this film 5 stars.  I really enjoyed it.  I was impressed with the acting, the writing, everything.  It is a phenominal thriller and well worth checking out!fantasy element that doesn't make sense, this one tried to stay as close to the truth as possible.

006097625X|5.0|Even as a lifelong reader of many types of comics (superheroes, Asterix, underground, manga, etc.) this book was a revelation. McCloud has a gife for explaining the why's and how's of sequential art in a way that kept my attention through the whole book. As a professional artist and multimedia developer, the concepts McCloud puts forth regarding human perception of two-dimensional sequential art have helped bring me to a new level and I have recommended this book to others in my field who have found it equally useful and fascinating.<br />And if any of you comic readers know people who mercilessly rag on you for being a geek, this book just might shut them up.
B000002UDD|3.0|Dave's substance abuse is a problem in this album making it sound wimpy compared to the last and my favorite cd by megadeth peace sells. Its Also that Chris Poland tears it all up to pieces in Peace, but in So Far Jeff Young sounds more like a mediocre mixture of Yngwie and Van Halen and makes the album sound less threatening as before.<BR>The best Songs here <BR>are first the &quot;Into the lungs of Hell&quot; Instrumental, This song has a sweet riff and nice continuing lick by Young throughout.<BR> &quot;Set the World on fire&quot; is the best song and most normal song on here, resembling earlier Metallica. It has the best Riff and the most decent lyrics.<BR>&quot;In My Darkest Hour&quot; is always a favorite, starting out with acoustic guitar and getting heavier as it progressing and includes a shredding solo by Young.<BR>&quot;502&quot; has a sweet riff that sound really cool with the drum beat, and a kick ass Vai like tapping solo by Young. The lyrics  again are a minus in this song but the riff makes up for it.<br />&quot;Hook in Mouth&quot; the other decent song on here.<BR>&quot;Liar&quot; is a hot thrasher apparently aimed at Poland for stealing some of Dave's Guitars. It has some funny lyrics<BR>&quot;Mary Jane&quot; This song is good, but the lyrics are disturbing, you have be seriously wasted to write about  some witch named Mary Jane.<BR>&quot;Anarchy In The UK&quot; this song is okay, tis not the best here, but the cd is not the best so it fits right in,...in its own wierd sort of way.<br />So You See, this album has its best songs and its worst like any other cd. If your Going To get all of megadeth's thrash records, do not miss this one, buts its definatly not a good place to start either, at least get Peace Sells.. before touching this.
B0000DZEA1|5.0|i just like to say one thing, when smeagel kills deagel in the begging, wheres that track on the cd, the tence throbbing sound and the strings?. that was my favourite part, i listend to this cd and its not there.
B00004BZ16|4.0|This ablumb is great. Its kinda long to sit down and listen to it all in one setting though. The reggae, dub, blues, hip hop, all just sounds great. With tunes like crooked beat, Something about England, Kingston Advice, and Somebody Got Murdered a purchase of this album is truly recommened
B00005JMTN|4.0|Director Tim Burton brings his wonderful imagination into this lively, fantasy-drama. The film is about the wonderful life of Edward Bloom, whose wonderous tales may be a little far-fetched, but enjoyable none the same.<br />When Bloom is on his death bed, his estranged son Will goes by his side but can't hide the fact that he thinks his father's stories are fabricated, and not knowing who his dad really is. <br />The film goes off to a slow start, but once the audience delves into Bloom's stories, including meeting a monsterous, but friendly giant, the viewers get hooked to the determined Bloom. We also found out how he met his sweetheart, his exploits in a traveling circus, his successful business with a idealized southern town, and encountering a very big fish.<br />The wonderful cast includes Ewan McGregor who plays the young Bloom, while Albert Finney plays the dying elder. The supporting cast is also great. Tim Burton knows how to get the actors' performances right, but also the fact he lets us view his vivid mind into making this complexed film. \\"Big Fish\\" is a sweet and filled with heart. Highly reccommended film.
B00005JMF6|5.0|i thought this movie was really good. it had the really good characters.  Halle Berry did really good job on the movie. i thought it was scary and that it kept me supense all the way throw the movie.  this is a movie that i would tell everybody to go see. i can't wait until it comes out on dvd. so that i can watch it any time that i want to.
B0000BYM3K|5.0|Very well done by my standards.  It cannot compare to previous albums, but its still maiden.  If ur a fan, you wont put em down with this album like Metallica fans did with St. Anger.  Theres effort and heart in Dance of Death.  And a track written by Nicko, can't say how happy i am.  The songs are a bit mor melodic this album, but can still give metal fans chills with some of heir solos.  5 stars A+ maiden!  UP THE IRONS!

B000021Y77|5.0|Excellent!  A must buy for all you movie gors out there.  Why is it so great?  The story is pretty plainly written, but the innovation truly makes it a must see movie. If i could rate higher than five, i would.

0606200711|5.0|Ignatius Reilly was the original slacker back when this novel was written in the early sixties- before there was a name for it. It isn't that he just avoids work for it's own sake, it is just that he just doesn't have the time or patience for what the modern commercial world considers to be work. He has better things to do with his time. You see, Ignatius is a thoroughly medieval man. His is primarily an internal life grounded and centerered in &quot;theology and geometry.&quot; According to these consistent standards, Ignatius' life, behavior, and appearance are perfectly rational and understandable. Unfortunately, Ignatius lives in mid-twentieth century America, a time and place of mind-numbing conformity, intolerance, and efficiency. He is doomed to perpetual misunderstanding and conflict.<br />That is the tragedy to this most excellent of commedies- being an intelligent misfit in a world of mind-numbing conformity. The author choose to leave it rather than conform, while Ignatius found the inner strength to fight and/or disreguard it. Neither let it possess and change them into modern mass-produced robots in the consumer society.....<br /><br />I wish that I could give it 500 stars.
B00004U45G|5.0|the moment i picked it i thought how weird. and after hearing it it still felt weird. but the getting used to period did not take long. hearing songs like ten years gone, hey hey what can i do, done so perfectly and in my time of dying my personal favorite led zeppelin tune ever, live makes this album worth it from there. throw in some old blues and the combination of jimmy page and the black crowes and this album is ridiculous and a must have for every led zeppelin fan.
9506440387|5.0|I read this book before I ventured out into the real world, and I read it again many years after I had returned from that world. After I read it, I wanted to kick myself for not learning more from it the first time.... But then, that is also covered in this story, Siddhartha's father could not protect him from the world, nor could Siddhartha protect his own son when the time came. You've got to go forth and learn these lessons yourself. It is the same archetypical patterns, with variations, over and over.<br /><br />I remember that when I first read this story it confused me that the Buddha and Siddhartha were two separate persons. Then I came to realise the truth of archetypes, and immortal paterns that resonate in many different bodies at the same time- all seemingly separate, but all really sharing the same great life. All ultimately flowing together to form the great river of life.
B0000700KL|5.0|This is an amazing film with cinematography that blew my mind.  Some parts were actually &quot;trippy&quot; yet they were natural wonders of the world with no special effects.  Other scenes were a little unsettleing yet the realism of it affects you.  I am 24 and think that every person my age should see this movie to have a greater appreciation for the earth in general and all that it has to offer, including things that I could never have imagined.  It offerered me a surreal experience in a simple movie!  I recommend at least renting it if you don't take my word on buying it.  But it's cool to entertain with too.
0399230033|5.0|The creators of children's picture books that seek to enchant the viewer always run the risk of sometimes becoming TOO sweet.  A book that's dripping with sweetie-pie sentiments is always in danger of disgusting the discerning (and purchasing) parent.  \\"Good Night, Gorilla\\", on the other hand, balances deftly between sweet and smart, becoming both at once.  In a simple story, a night watchman at a zoo bids goodnight to each of his animals as a sneaky gorilla unlocks them one by one.  The unwitting watchman goes home (animals in tow) and it's up to his wife to put them all to bed again.  If I was a better writer I'd be able to tell you just how cute this book is.  It's SO cute!  But not stupid in the least.  Rathmann has filled this story with clever little subplots that kids will enjoy following.  A small mouse with a banana lugs the heavy object from picture to picture.  Rathmann even goes so far as to wrap a picture on the back of the book's cover around and into the inner fold where the tiny mouse stands by, patiently.  The book also emotes deadpan beautifully.  In one scene the watchman's wife says goodnight to her husband and the page goes black.  Next we hear each animal in the room (that crept in unbeknownst to her) saying goodnight back.  The two page spread that follows is just a single pair of wide open eyes in the black dark room.  The deadpan wit will not be lost on either kids or their adult parents.  If you'd like a book that you can read fifty times over without getting nauseated or bored, find yerself a copy of \\"Good Night, Gorilla\\", and count yourself lucky for having discovered it.
B00008J2DQ|1.0|There is a difference between influence and bad imitation, Godsmack is the latter. With &quot;Faceless&quot; they simply recycle old growls, wah-wah solos (can't this guy solo without the peddle?) and attempts at trying to create witchy type of rock. If &quot;Godsmack&quot; was an alright debut and &quot;Awake&quot; a collection of senseless visions that were trying too hard, then &quot;Faceless&quot; is simply the last effort to squeeze out from what's left. Sully Erna as we all know is a practicing wiccan, but he tries too hard to make that a point in his lyrics, as if he wants to be the Jim Morrison for the new metal era (eventhough Morrison would have never been so obvious or hollow, and he wasn't a wiccan anyway, he just liked dark expressions). His growls are already a been there, done that job. In fact, Godsmack's material has become so repetitive that songs like &quot;Straight Out Of Line&quot; and &quot;I Stand Alone&quot; can be connected to make one long track. Godsmack lacks the sense of melody and grand design that powered groups like Metallica or the sense of real, authentic anger of Nirvana and this band's prime source of imitation, Alice In Chains. The instrumentals are nothing more than a guide to playing simple, loud chords without any intricate touches. &quot;Serenity&quot; is a cheap attempt at another tribal ending like their previous &quot;spiritual&quot; numbers, &quot;Voodoo&quot; and &quot;Spiral.&quot; &quot;Faceless&quot; sounds like Godsmack trying to be too sad and too commercial, sad as in a trend because groups like these are simply trying to make feeling pissed into a style or something. If Kurt Cobain was truly expressing the scars of his soul, Sully Erna is expressing the commercialized version of anger. Those looking for a better experience should instead check out Audioslave.
6305907145|5.0|While not a literary scholar on English society and history, I did discover that the movie was very successful in telling a story about love worth waiting (for).  After all, is not that the one quality we each hope and long for in our lives?  I'm an old fashion romantic and this movie was true to the author's message...it is (after all) an adaptation of a great literary classic, and the director/writer does have &quot;poetic&quot; license to retell the story, in terms we can all understand...since we no longer speak 18th/19th century English.
B000067IZ3|4.0|A little background first. Mexican President Carlos Salinas de Gortari from 1988 to 1994 was sent in exile to the United States after he lost the election to Ernesto Zedillo in 1995; wherefrom, the FBI discovered an enormous recycling of drug traffic money that belonged to the ex-President.  It was subsequently discovered that the one running this trade was the President's brother Raul. All this and more is lurking behind the film \\"Traffic\\", a mind-boggling intrigue of drugs, dirty money and politics.  It is a very difficult cinematic job to combine these elements along with the social degradation, which results, especially in terms of the teen-ager population that is affected, without resorting to moralist and dogmatic messages. The results of \\"Traffic\\" are undeniably high and the film shows Soderbergh's talent in treating political subject matter. However, the reason I did not give this film the full five stars is because I prefer the British original film that sets the events in Pakistan. This film eerily discussed the issues surrounding the drug trade along the Pakistan - Afghanistan border and the difficulty that authorities of all stripes - the Taliban had actually been the most successful even if their methods were very crude - at reducing the cultivation of poppies. That being said, this film along with the book \\"Reefer Madness\\"' by Eric Schlosser will help you undertand the gravity of the drug problem as well as the infectiveness and injustice of the methods employed by governments to restrict the tarde and use of narcotics.
B000063DFN|4.0|Iron maiden is a great band with highly acessibly songs that any open minded person could enjoy, and if yur looking in to iron maiden i would definatly recomend starting with this album for an introduction into metal &amp; and the Band it self, aces flying high, 2 minutes to midnight, and Flash of the blade are all here, if you want to dig deeper definatly check out the number of the beast.
0316666343|3.0|I decided (like many others) to read this book based on what others had said. I read it with an open mind - finding neither the rape, murder nor the heaven Sebold has created disturbing. But the truth is that this novel is just nothing special. Ray and Ruth's obsession with Susie and her death just seemed werid and boring. I thought more could have been made of Susie's mother and her inner turmoil but the only glimpse we got was how she was so relaxed when alone (from the photograph) as if she was another person. I loved Mrs. Singh's character but was left with only the smell of her exotic cigarttes and her apple pies. <br />I'll admit I got some good thrills from the novel, like when Susie's younger sister goes searching through Mr. Harvey's house...but it didn't pay off. The ending was just a big let down. I couldn't believe that if you died, but were given one more chance for only a few hours to come back to life, that all you would do is sleep with a high school crush. But thats just what Susie did. It's almost as if the author could not be bothered to have to write about the charaters dealing with saying goodbye to Susie and catching her killer if she had spoken to them. <BR>I undestand the connection between Ray...but what a waste of a chance when you have the whole family still trying to come to terms with the loss.
0553296981|5.0|My object was to find an autobiography for a class bookreport. In addition, I wanted something my ...daughter would get more than her monthly report out of.<br />I picked up this book after she was finished, not planning on reading the whole  book, but I became hooked.  This book offers real insight into the mind of a teen age girl during some real trying times.  There is something about reading about it in her words,  her expressions, emotions, etc.  that make this historical time really stand out.  It gives the reader a real understanding of what it must have felt like to live during this time.<br />If you want an autobiography with a life changing message, I would recomend this one.
B000005ILF|5.0|This is a fantastic album.  Very smooth and melodic yet upbeat and frisky, yet also revealing and honest. This is by far is best work.
B00000IGGA|1.0|Just skip it.  Assume he's never done it.  Everything else is still so very good.  And he remedied himself in Blood Money anyway.
B0000DD7LC|2.0|I fell in love with Keyes' voice when I first heard &quot;Fallin'&quot; and immediately bought her first CD.  I enjoyed some of the music from it, and felt she showed enormous potential.  This second CD is a real disappointment.  The songs all have very similar themes: Songs in A Minor had much more variety.  She needs to use her tremendous voice and talent to expand past the hum-drum, run-of -the-mill background beats and music.  I really feel that she is settling for the sound or style of a mediocre singer and songwriter, when she could be so much more.  She seems almost to ignore her classy, intelligent side, afraid to leave the comfort of her &quot;street&quot; attitude.  I'd love to see her combine both.  &quot;Fallin'&quot;, I hope, won't be her only glorious hit.  Here's hoping her next CD is better.
0790732254|5.0|Great performances, great dialog, great cinematography, great music. It just doesn't get any better and I don't think it ever will.
B00006ZCFH|3.0|What is the difference between the death of neo-soul and the birth of freakquency? Erykah's statement on Worldwide Underground is about the world. She experiments with different sounds. Of course, this music is trippy, dark, soulful, and experimental. This is a EP that is way too long. It sounds like Badu just went into the studio and messed around with things. I only wish that she could've kept the original mix of \\"Love of My Life\\" on here. Instead she added the \\"worldwide\\" mix, without the original. The rest of the tracks except \\"Woo\\" and \\"The Grind\\" are great. What makes Worldwide Underground so special? Nothing, it's just a long EP full of experimental R&B. Come On Badu, when are you doing a full-length album? We have been waiting since 2001 for a new album. The drawings that Miss Badu created with a black ink pen are great. They look beautiful, but I wonder what they represent? Is it a sign that she is changing to different directions or is it just that she want us to visualize beauty? Overall, Worldwide Underground is one of those experimental hip-hop/R&B album that some listeners will love or just hate because it's different from her previously released records.
B0000AUHOH|3.0|Star Trek V is the fifth Star Trek feature and the second last for the Original series crew.<br />Most people regard this as the worst Star Trek film ever made, and look for reasons to attack the film and William Shatner in general.<br />Being a Star Trek fan for some time now, I try to take a more objective stance on things. Here's what I thought of the movie:<br />Good points about The Final Frontier:<br />-The acting is top drawer, particularly between Sybok and the heroes, Kirk, Spock and McCoy.<br />-The film features some very nice camera work, particulalry with the introduction of Sybok and also on Sha Ka Ree. Also, the orbital scene at the end, featuring the Klingons and the Enterprise, is a beautiful shot.<BR>-The soundtrack is excellent, particularly towards the end of the film.<BR>-The film features some nice moments of comedy, particularly among the lesser cast members (lesser only in terms of amount of screentime they recieve). Some of the comedy is a little inappropriate, but for the most part it's pretty good.<BR>-The exploration of religion, normally a tabboo subject in Star Trek, is done nicely.<br />Bad points about The Final Frontier:<br />-The FX are not terribly good, reminiscent of those in The Original Series. That being said, the FX for the approach to The Great Barrier (particularly when seen from the observation lounge) are pretty good. But most of the FX are of fairly low quality.<BR>-There are obvious script problems, particularly with some of the dialouge scenes. I'm no expert on the subject, but I can see some clear moments of script weakness throughout the film.<BR>-There are several continuity errors, most notably the one concerning the trip to the centre of the galaxy. The edge of the Great Barrier is nearly 20,000 light years from Earth, which would be almost a 40 year trip for the Enterprise. A technical explanation for this should have been made in the film. I have made a reason myself to justify this, as I believe that Sybok knewof ancient subspace corridor routes to Sha Ka Ree, but I won't go into that.<BR>-The role of the Klingons in the film wasn't done well at all. There should have been some sort of minor starship combat scene between them and Kirk early in the movie. His feelings towards them are also inconsistent with those expressed in ST:III and ST:VI, where they are finally resolved. I found this to be one of the lowpoints of the film.<BR>-Anothe problem stemming from the script again concerns the Great Barrier. It was contually emphasised that it was incredibly dangerous and that no ship had ever been able to get through. Yet the Enterprise passed through easily. More should have been done with that sequence.<br />Overall, ST:V is an enjoyable film, but it does have faults. I recommend people who like Star Trek, whether they be serious or casual fans, to buy this film.

B00008WG3U|5.0|I don't need a bunch of prosy b.s. to simply say, this is hands down the best NOFX album I've ever heard.  It screams back to the hardcore era, where punk was just better.  It's politically aware, and not just about Mom's Rules (tm).  If you're an old cynical punk or even a young idealistic punk, you'll like this album.  An instant 5.
B0000E6I1J|4.0|I am amazed that whomever formated this soundtrack left out the A+ tune of the night, Sam Brown/Jools Holland's rip'em out of their seats rendition of Horse To Water. Bad call.
0385504209|5.0|This book kept you guessing and kept you asking questions about the things you have always believed to be true. Better than that, it was almost impossible to put the book down once you get started. The intricate fictional story line laced throughout endless shreds of mind numbing fact and exploits. It was a book that I will read again and probably a third time.
B0000VAFO0|3.0|This is very ambitious film about vampires and werewolves. Apparently, vampires and werewolves (or \\"lycans\\" - apparently \\"werewolf\\" was too mundane a moniker for the filmmakers) have been warring with each other for centuries, right up to the present day. We get to see plenty of flashbacks throughout this historical war, and this sub-story is the best part of the movie. The rest consists of the modern-day adaptation of these creatures - vampires that make artificial blood, perform genetic experiments, and have computerized storage for the undead. In some respects this is interesting, since if these creatures did exist they would probably adapt in this way. But I was far more interested in the backstory, of which we see too little.<br />There's a weak love story, brought down by Kate Beckinsale's knock-off matrix performance - we've already seen the pouty, emotionless hot brunette in latex, haven't we? - and an interesting twist involving who the real bad guys are. But for the most part it's harmless action, peppered with peaks of an interesting story that's not fully developed. I recommend renting, not buying. It's not going to have much repeat watchability. Although the concept is interesting, it's not pulled off in a convincing way. It could have been much better with a more dynamic female lead, a bad guy who wasn't such a weanie (Michael Sheen as Lucian).
0688163173|1.0|The ending of this book was so horrible it actually got me out of bed, made me turn on my computer, and write this review at 2AM.  I'm not sure how this book received the rave reviews given on amazon. I always finish reading books I begin but I didn't think I would be able to make it through this one.  Some people talk about the surprise ending and how great and unexpected it was. But, if the book is sub-par to begin with, who cares about the ending?  I actually began skimming, which is something I never do, about halfway through.<br />The ending is very confusing and frankly not worthy of deep thought to try and understand the authors meaning.  And, by the end of the book I could care less about any of the possible scenarios I briefly thought out.  Before you read this you might want to do a google search for &quot;Shutter Island explanation&quot; to see how many others were confused too.  There doesn't seem to be a consensus in terms of the outcome and I have already wasted too much of my time reading this to bother thinking about it.  I love books that provoke thought but not books that are unworthy of it and have wasted my time!  Stay away from this at $18.00 or at the library for that matter.
B0000UMD00|1.0|This has to be one of the worst efforts from one of the most promising stars ever to have been released!  I'm not sure what Pink is trying to do with this album -- although clearly she is gunning for some kind of Punkish persona having watched other pop-Punks (aka sheep in wolf's clothes) cash in -- whatever it is, it translates into extremely poor production, repetitive and boring music, and self-aggrandizing lyrics that would make Narcissus him/herself blush.  I don't generally write bad reviews -- Momma said if you ain't got nothin nice to say.... -- but in this case I feel like I'm doing a public service by warning you:  THIS ALBUM WILL BORE YOU TO TEARS and make you wish that pop stars read a bit more and tried to develop, instead of only admire, themselves.  Not for Pink fans..... for those with a Pink fetish only!
B0000DJZA5|3.0|Although Let It Be was a good album after being spectorized, we're lucky that this wasn't released in its original form.  No wonder it cost Capital records money.  This sounds like they really didn't care anymore and the tracks were poorly done.  However, The Long And Winding Road is still a beautiful song no matter what form it is in.  The 2nd CD is just a recording of the Beatles at work in the studio which is better listening than the album itself.  They sound like they're having fun with what they're doing.  They're laughing, joking and singing.  Unfortunately this does not come out in the Let It Be recording.  If you're a true Beatles fan like I am, then I'd say get it just to add to the collection.  If not, don't waste your money.  Thank God I got it on sale.
B0000035E7|4.0|Ok, I gave this four stars mainly because of Blew, about a girl and the cover of love buzz. Its not that the other songs are all bad, but they are in no way great and many of them require you to listen to them several times before you like them. Nirvana had some great songs at that time, but for some reason didnt put them on this album, however they did later release some of them on incesticide. About a girl (which sounds better when played on an acoustic guitar, in their unplugged album)and blew are the only songs which truly show off Kurt's songwriting talents. These songs definately hint at what is to come on their later albums. <br />Chad Channing really gives those drums a pounding, but this is no good thing, he hits them way to hard, in later albums, his hard hitting will be replaced with the lightening fast drumming of Dave Grohl. who is a far better drummer. Kurt has not yet perfected what would later become his distinct vocal style, although this gives his voice a sort of raw edge, however it is still not up to the standard of Nirvana's later work. <br />If you are new to nirvana, dont get this, get Nevermind, its far more accessable and contains their most famous songs, such as come as you are and smells like teen spirit (if you havent heard any of their other songs, you've more than likely heard this one). As I said earlier, bleach takes a few listens to really get into, and even then its not all that great.
B0000E6I1J|5.0|What can I say?  This is awesome.  The love for George Harrison from his friends and band mates truely shines through on this collection.  Although Tom Petty was a friend of George's, he could have stayed away.  The only two songs on this CD that are not so good are the ones Tom and his heartbreakers sing, i.e. Taxman and one of George's most beautiful tunes, I Need You.  Tom really butchers them.  The rest of the CD is superb.  It's strange to hear Paul McCartney singing a George penned Beatles tune though.  Every track on this CD is superb.  I don't know who Joe Brown is, but he too does an excellent job on the tunes he takes the lead on.  I almost forgot to mention too that this is a 2 CD set.  The first CD has 4 tracks by Ravi Shankar, one track being The Inner Light, a George Harrison Beatles B side.  I'm not much into Indian music, but this is superb and I can really get into it.  Personally, while I sat listening to this, my emotional side came out.  Listening to this CD really watered my eyes up.  This CD truely brings out the type of person that George Harrison was and the realization of him no longer with us really hits home.  He was my favorite Beatle too!
B00005KFUN|4.0|Muse are not the best band ever, neither are they all that original, they sound a lot like bands who were around in the early 90s and late 80s, but saying that, they do have a little spark of originality to them. <br />Also, why the hell are people comparing them to radiohead, apart from the fact that radiohead suck and muse dont, they both sound completely different.
6301763041|5.0|WOW, I had no idea Johnny Depp could play Elvis! This musicical ROCKS! If you thought the Elvis movies were a little too pat, take a look at this! A would-be simple plot, add some great tunes, and Johnny Depp swiveling and growling about his best girl, and you got yourself a cult following! She's a square, but he's gonna bring her into his gang and let her be cool and sing hot! He goes to juvey hall and does the jailhouse rock, while she sings outside to get him sprung early. And quite a list of off-beat characters in this flick, each with their own unique nickname! My favorite scene is Johnny teaching the square to french kiss the cool way! Check this movie out and turn the volume up for the music, but keep an eye on Johnny and his gang.
078401213X|5.0|If you are fascinated by mathematics/fractals, the Kabbalah (Cabala), psychology and one human being's unexpected/ unsought for connection to Ultimate Reality/Infinity/G-d this film will meet your expectations. The filming technique is just as important as the theme/message in this film. It is deliberately done in black and white and with minimal dialogue ... therefore when Max, the computer specialist experiences what at first appears to be a blinding light with a migraine headache or perhaps, even a seizure, the viewer is drawn, pulled. tangled into the intense emotional experience and questions of what it all means. It gradually dawns on the viewer this is something much Bigger than what it appears ... Max has been working on a computer program to discover an answer to a very important formula. He discovers the answer which is a set of numbers that connects him to Ultimate Reality. One does not exactly know what the final outcome will be ... the Hasidic Jews want his computer program/formula and so do Wall Street executives and a large corporation. The chase is on and there lies the mystery of the film ... This film will appeal to a highly discriminating group of people who initially like the basic themes set forth in the first sentence of this review. Anyone else will find fault as the approach to this film is almost avant garde but highly effective to achieve maximum impact. Erika Borsos (erikab93)
B00006CXSS|5.0|Without a doubt, HBO's mini-series based on Stephen E. Ambrose's book _Band of Brothers_, is the best war film ever produced! Steven Spielberg and Tom Hanks has proven unequivocally that the old adage &quot;truth is stranger (and more interesting) than fiction,&quot; holds true. Realism and an undauted quest to bring to the screen the actuality of the combat experience in an infantry company, resonates in the countless themes exhibited throughout the film. The production team, that consisted of eight directors, including Hanks, has accomplished an extraordinary feat both on and beneath the surface of this remarkable mini-series. What the viewer sees in this action-packed movie will delight the staunchest war film aficionado. The directors utilize the same revolutionary cinematography techniques first seen in Spielberg's prior effort, &quot;Saving Private Ryan.&quot; The chaotic hand-held camera work places the viewer right in the heart of the battle scenes. The addition of all the latest computer generated special effects, clearly confirms how great a war movie can be when backed by a big budget (lucky for us Spielberg is a World War II buff). The night jump over Normandy is arguably the best battle sequence ever shot on film. But it is the countless themes beneath the surface of the film that makes &quot;Band of Brothers&quot; a true gem, and destined to become a film classic. Let us always remember that this is not only the story of an elite Airborne company, but of the actual men who made up Easy Company. The Army succeeded in molding these men into a fine-tuned combat effective team through the most intense, rugged mental and physical training. Individuality is discarded and team-work is exemplified if one is to survive in combat. Yet regardless of the level of training, it is human beings that are sent into combat, and Easy Company's rank and file consisted of individuals of varying and diverse human attributes and character defects. And the film illustrates the &quot;humanity&quot; of Easy Company beautifully. The 506th Parachute Infantry Regiment had good and bad leaders. The outstanding and natural leadership abilities of its level-headed commander Captain (later Major) Richard Winters (Damien Lewis) are off-set my many who could not make the grade. Anyone in a managerial position at any corporate level would benefit from watching the varying leadership styles depicted in this film. Likewise, a handful of youths filled with a volatile mixture of naivety and bravado will, through fire and death, become a solid cadre of N.C.O's. Their role is vital not only to a successful combat mission, but also to the survival of green replacements. Yet the horrors of war affected all ranks within Easy Company and the producers wisely chose not to sugar-coat anything. Alcoholism and the murder of enemy prisoners by officers and enlisted men alike, are very real themes boldly conveyed in the film. Combat exhaustion, or &quot;battle fatigue&quot; is another unpleasant topic displayed in the film. Men who could not be broken physically (several of Easy Company men recovered from wounds and went A.W.O.L from hospital to rejoin their unit), succumbed to the mental strain of constant exposure to enemy fire. Looting, murder and a general callousness towards the German civilian population after witnessing the horrors of a concentration camp, are also very real occurrences that took place within the entire European Theater at war's end. Band of Brothers is not only an action-packed and riveting war picture, but also an accurate social history of the American G.I. in World War II. Any combat veteran, particularly those who fought in Europe, can relate to the experiences (both internal and external) of these men. Any relative of a combat veteran, regardless of what unit he served, will gain a better understanding of their loved-one's experiences. Captains Winters, Nixon; Lieutenant Speirs, Compton; Sergeants Lipton, Martin, Randleman, Toye, Guarnere, Malarkey and others are not made-up characters, they are real men. And it is their real-life experiences, so accurately captured in this film that defies any screenwriter's pen. I cannot recommend this package highly enough. Five stars...Bravo!nere, Malarkey and others are not made-up characters, they are real men. And it is their real-life experiences, so accurately captured in this film that defies any screenwriter's pen. I cannot recommend this package highly enough. Five stars...Bravo!

B0000AFX64|2.0|Since this was produced for television and never originally intended to be a feature film how could it possibly be widescreen?  Very shameful of the company to distribute this under the false pretense that it is a widescreen feature film.
B00007ELEL|5.0|The Big Lebowski is your typical Coen brothers film.  However, what makes this standout are the characters, who are altogether hilarious, pathetic, and weird.  The setup is simple: A bowler and stoner named The Dude (Jeff Bridges) is inadvertently involved in the kidnapping of a millionaire's wife and the hilarity ensues from this point onward.  If you're in the mood for a smart mystery, this is not that film.  The performances are consistently excellent throughout.  Bridges is superb in this film, embodying the spirit and mannerisms of The Dude, and you want to root for his character and lifestyle.  John Goodman, the Dude's violence-prone, Vietnam veteran best friend, is just as good as Bridges, and they complement each other very well.  Steve Buscemi is also good as the 'sanest' of the trio.  Julianne Moore is on hand to provide more confusion and complication in the Dude's life.  John Turturro is hilarious as the wacky Jesus Quintana, and maybe this movie should have put a couple of bowling sequences with him in it.  Just watch this movie on a lazy afternoon because this movie has a lazy pacing and way about it.  I don't know if this movie is everyone's cup of tea, but if it has a strong 'cult' following, it's worth a preview.
B0000U5RNU|4.0|If your not a fan of slapstick English humor then this probably isn't for you.I happen to like it a lot,very funny stuff,the first movie i had ever seen him in was Rat Race which i also thought was funny.Although it is very predictable the tasteful humor and great english accent's always keep you amused,i have'nt seen many UNtalented english actor's.The first time you watch it you may think yeah thats funny,but watch it a second time and its a definate charm.
B000065U1N|3.0|I give this movie three stars for the fact that it tries to give respect for that day. I acknowledge that and in turn share that respect for Ridley Scott.<br />I saw the movie before I read the book and being the adolecent that I was and still am, I based my knowledge of that day off the movie. After reading the book just recently, my feelings toward the movie have changed. Unlike Ridley Scott, Mark Bowden busted his ass going around the world and interviewing everyone who he could find that was there on the ground that day. Bowden also adds at the end of the book that he tried in his best to keep everything in the book as factual as possable, and that the parts in which he can't be for certain, he tried hard in getting as close to the context as he could.<br />In contrast and compare from the movie to the book, their are alot of things that happen in the movie... that didn't happen in the book which in turn didn't actually happen at all. Being a little more mature now then I was when this movie came out, I feel a little hurt seeing the movie and realizing that it's going to give everyone a misunderstanding of why and what we were there for. For example, Eversmann's chalk four left with the convoy. Chalk four never made it to Wolcott's crash site. Yet in the movie, the camera surrounds Matt Eversmann(Josh Hartnett) through out the whole movie. I don't have disrespect for Eversmann, I just have disrespect that I think the intent was giving Josh Hartnett good PR.<br />I have more to say but 1000 characters isn't enough. If you want an action film, this movie won't let you down; If you want a better understanding of what happened that day, books are your best option. Three stars.
B00005A1VH|5.0|This is one of our favorite movies.  Please, someone, bring it out on DVD before this wonderful film is lost to the next generation.  Everyone could glean something positive from watching this movie.  I just can't say enough about it.  We especially love to watch it around Veteran's Day or the Fourth of July.  Reminds us of how we got this far.  Love it!  Love it!  Love it!
B00013PHGS|5.0|AIR's North American debut, 'Moon Safari' was an instant classic. The unusual style of their music soon permeated our pop culture. The ambient sounds were perfect for department stores PA systems and commercials for types of products marketed to a wide demographic range. But the best feature was that the songs were beautiful. I doubt I am alone in rating 'Moon Safari' as one of the top releases of the 90's.<br />I recently had the chance to listen to the advance of Walkie Talkie and WOW! This is really good. There isn't a single weak track. This is the first MUST HAVE CD of 2004. I suspect AIR will sell lots of music this year. 'Cherry Blossom Girl' is quintesential AIR and I believe it will be the first single. I would be stunned if it wasn't a hit.<br />'Mike Mills' is a fantastic accoustical track as is 'Alone in Kyoto.' <br />Their vocals seem a bit more confident. Less vocoder effects this time. I have not heard the bonus tracks you get with this 'enhanced' version, but they are icing on the cake and incentive to buy now!<br />Analog synths and acoustical instruments have never sounded so good.
B000060OFT|5.0|Well, what can I say... I know that there are a lot of people out there that do not particulary like this flim.  That's okay, but let me tell you, i think this flim is so different (in a good way).  The director, Baz Luhrmann, inteneded for this film to be modern visually, yet Shakespearian verbally.  Its that combonation that reminds you that you, the viewer are still watching a movie, that this could in no way duplicate real life.  Baz has a way of luring the viewer into so fantasyland, where there are artistic images, romantic love plots, tragic endings, a modern setting, and an in-tact William Shakespeare lyric.  Its a masterpiece.  I really hope everybody would for once have an open mind, and treat yourself to viewing this film.. We must appreciate the creativity and genious aspects of the Director's intent.
B000006TSC|3.0|Breathless is best described as a frustrating effort of an excellent progressive rock band to make pop-oriented tunes and make money. I'm not beeing radical, it's just what I fell when I listen to this album. I'm an old Camel fan and I know what they did before Breathless. The departure of the strong bassist Ferguson after Moonmadness (76') killed some of Camel's vitality and virtuosism. Richard Sinclair is a very nice bass player, but he didn't fit in Camel's spirit, neither Mel Collins. The line-up is very strong, in theory, but it's not what I've seem in Breathless and later albums. There's another problem, Bardens started using those horrible plastic sounding keyboards avaiable at that time, altough playing them very well. Latimer and his singular guitar sound is just OK in the album, except in Summer Lightining and in You Make Me Smile, where he and the whole band are playing pure disco crap ! These tracks are among Camel's worst records (except for the excelent guitar solo in Summer Lightining)! Ward, that really kicks off in Mirage, Snow Goose and Moonmadness, is too much economic and shy in Breathless.. a serious disappointment for me and many other Camel fans all around the world ! Anyway, Breathless has some very good moments, bringing a soft Camel atmosphere that almost has gone after this album. The title song, Breathless, is a typical soft-rock Camel track, very good. Echoes is the best track, with Sleeper. Two excelent Camel progressive rock tracks, where Latimer, Bardens and Collins simply rocks ! Seven minutes lenght, each one, with beautiful guitar solos, non-plastic keyboard sounds and gentle wind instruments. The vocals are better than in any previous Camel albuns, but vocals never was Camel best characteristic ! The rest of the album are Camel late 70's songs, oscilating from good to not so good... There are some influences of Caravan and Cantebury (Richard Sinclair !), that gives an elegant contribution to the album. Well, not a Camel classic, neither a total crap. If you want to listen to Camel goodies, get Mirage, The Snow Goose and Moonmadness first. Then, try Raindances, and then Nude, or Rajaz.. After all these albums, try Breathless and maybe you'll not get disappointed with this marvelous band !
B0000DD7LB|2.0|When I bought this album I was expecting something, maybe even a comeback- after her awful &quot;Britney&quot; album, I had my doubts, as the single &quot;Me Against the Music&quot; is one of the worst songs of the year, no thanks to the material girl, but getting back task, it was awful.  Just a girl who can dance, groan, whisper, and is part of a label with a decent sythesizer, it's not worth your money, maybe miss &quot;grown-up&quot; (grown-up? that's just something we've all been waiting for her to do) can go back to the &quot;less mature&quot;, but good first two albums.
6305897786|1.0|I was expecting a lot more from this film. Depp's acting is very good and the story about authenticating the book written by the devil is quite interesting. Unfortunately the film is neither scary nor contains any action or suspense whatsoever. I was at least expecting an appearance from Lucifer himself but no, this film just drags and ends in a whimper.
B00005JME0|5.0|This movie is incredible. Anyone who tells you otherwise is simply one of those people who watch stupid movies with cheesy plots, bodily fluid jokes, and explosions. This movie is amazing. Ashton Kutcher, in perhaps his first serious role, shines. The movie takes you back in time, and forward, and back again. Don't blink: you just might miss a plot twist. Despite what the title may tell you, this is not a horror film at all. It is somewhere along the lines of a cross between Memento and David Lynch's Lost Highway. A simply fantastic movie, and 2004's first must-see.
B00005JLKB|5.0|When's the second season coming out on DVD? That's all I have to say!!
076790592X|5.0|My husband and I received this book as part of our Christmas gift from my mother.  When I finished reading it I decided it was the best part.  If you only read one book this year, make it Tuesdays with Morrie.
B0000000KW|5.0|Anyone who tells you that Ringo Starr's solo work isn't as strong as John, Paul or George, obviously hasn't heard TIME TAKES TIME.  In fact, TIME TAKES TIME is in the upper echelon of solo Beatle Releases.  This album works on many levels.  Mostly, the songwriting is superb.  Ringo co-wrote a few songs, and hired a batch of top notch songwriters (Roger Manning from JELLYFISH is one) to pen the others.  WEIGHT OF THE WORLD is one of the best and catchiest songs on the CD. Other songs like DON'T GO WHERE THE ROAD DON'T GO, and AFTER ALL THESE YEARS, are among some of the best that Ringo has recorded.  The production is brilliant, and Ringo is in great voice as well. The most amazing thing about this CD is that it has held up quite well.  After repeated listens, it still sounds fresh and distinctive. This is an album full of melodic and disparate songs.  The many stylings (pop, rock, country) work very well.  Even though this CD didn't make the Billboard album charts, it is a favorite with critics and is an ESSENTIAL addition to any CD collection.
B000000SDB|5.0|From my perspective, this is THE standard set of recordings to compare against for any Beethoven symphony. The recordings are phenomenal. The collection received a 10/10 rating for sound and performance. The interpretations are mostly historically informed performances (but with modern instruments).<br /><br />I am a fan of the COE. The winds are particularly good.
B00000JG41|5.0|Do not let the boring package fool you: these songs will one day be recognized as true classics. Every one of them is a masterful blend of music and witty, often deep lyrics. You can dance to this music, or you can hit play and sit back to be lulled(assaulted) by the myriad tones and smart riff games.<br />  For those who dislike gangsta rap and repetitive pop music, Mr. Bungle present &quot;California&quot;, a most accomplished and consistently satisfying listen. A true classic in terms of the scope of the songs; complimentary STYLES of music are worked into the arrangements. The lounge beach feeling of 'Sweet Charity' recedes and an elevator music interlude is launched via bass into a hawaiian chill-out moment that segues back into the verse; the next track 'None Of Them Knew...' is an epic swingin' big band number that explodes into thrash passages and quiets into brooding jazzy exchanges- all accompanied by amusing sound effects. There's even a rockabilly guitar solo!<BR>   These are just the first two songs. Everything here shines briefly before being shoved aside by the next idea. There is no other record like this anywhere. Flawless and underrated at five stars. I will now only offer the cliched 'bravo'.
B0000DJZA5|5.0|Any new release from The Beatles ia a treat. This is no exception.  Having been around to hear all the original Beatles albums when they were first released, it is my belief that this version of the album would have done just as well on the charts as the &quot;official&quot; version.  <BR>It is great that Capitol has opened the vaults and released this material.  It really makes no difference to me who pushed to get the album reissued in this form.  The simple fact is that we have more of the material from the world's greatest band that has been sitting in the Capitol vaults for more than thirty years. I'm sure there is so much more waiting for release.  There are certainly eager fans waiting to hear it in such pristine sound quality.  <BR>Please, Capitol Records, keep it coming.
B000002L99|3.0|I admit that I am I big Roth fan, and I had second thoughts about buying this cd.  I love the awesome guitar playing of eddie, and I loved dave's vocals, but I wasn't sure if the Red Rocker could keep up with one of the greatest bands in the world.<br />When I got it and played it, it was ok, but nothing compared to the roth era.  There are good songs like Good Enough, Get Up, and 5150, but tracks like dreams and Love Walks in were just plain cheesy with the keyboards and pop sound.  Through the years,Van Halen basicly went from a Hard Rock band to a pop rock band.  The only thing that I really enjoyed was Eddie's guitar plying, and even that was less entegetic thn normal.  This album was ok, but you could do a lot better with a Roth Van Halen album, or even roth'solo albums.
B0000TB01Y|4.0|The chorus on the CD is fantastic, but sometimes the leads fail to shine. This is not any fault of their own, I blame the music. Stephen Schwartz has written much better material. If you want a good Schwartz expirence try Godspell, this manages to be just a lil' above average. If you are a fan of his Broadway, try his movie recordings, Hunchback of Notre Dame is my favorite.
B00005ALRO|4.0|I got The Fugitive when it first came out on video.  I never saw the TV series the movie is based on, but Harrison Ford is convincing as convicted murderer Dr. Richard Kimble.  After flashbacks of the scene of the murder of Richard's wife as well as Richard's trial, director Andrew Davis shows Richard boarding the prison bus.  On his way to prison, Richard survives a spectacular bus-train collision which kills all of his fellow prisoners, and after escaping the crash, he is pursued by U.S. Marshal Sam Gerard(Tommy Lee Jones), who vows to hunt him down.  While Sam is on his tail, Richard tries to lead Sam and Sam's fellow detectives to Sykes(Andreas Katsulas), the one-armed security guard who actually committed the murder.  Soon after he escapes, Richard removes his facial hair and hijacks an ambulance in order to get as far away from Sam as possible.  Richard is momentarily cornered at a waterfall, but when he is confronted by Sam, he shouts \\"I did not kill my wife!\\" and then jumps into the river.  With everybody except for Sam thinking he might have drowned, Richard eludes his pursuers by hiding along the riverbank, going through small towns, and eventually making his way back to Chicago, where he practiced medicine.  Along the way he crashes a St. Patrick's Day parade and a banquet, saves a young accident victim's life, and all the time tries to stay one step ahead of his pursuers by finding evidence that exonerates him, first by breaking into Sykes' apartment and then visiting former colleagues.  At Sykes' apartment, Richard retrieves Sykes' artificial arm and some photos taken at a gathering attended by executives of the drug company Sykes works for.  Meanwhile, Sam interviews acquaintances and colleagues of Richard's, including, in addition to alleged hit man Sykes, Richard's medical colleague Chuck Nichols(Jeroen Krabbe).  To make a long story short, Sykes, the one-armed man, is apprehended, and when Sam makes the climactic confrontation with Richard on the rooftop, he reveals that Chuck had borrowed Richard's car the night Richard's wife died(this was hinted at in the opening scenes), that Chuck had let himself into Richard's home using one of Richard's keys, and that Sykes, the hit man, had been with Chuck when the latter went to Richard's home, even though Sykes denied knowing Richard when Sam interviewed him.  In short, Richard is innocent.  Watching the film, I got a sense of Richard's desperation as he flees his pursuers.  At the same time, he emerges as a heroic figure as he puts all the pieces of the puzzle together.  Harrison's portrayal of Richard is dramatic and believable.  Tommy Lee Jones, however, steals the show as Sam, the U.S. Marshal.  Initially a gruff cop who is convinced of his suspect's guilt, Sam eventually mellows as he reveals that the proof he has points to Richard's innocence.  The plot seemed a little disjointed at times--I couldn't figure out at first how Richard's clues(the switched drug samples, his colleagues' interviews) matched up with Sam's(Chuck's meeting with Sykes and the photos taken from Sykes' apartment, for instance).  It turns out--at least it's implied--that Richard's deceased wife might have been involved in one of the failed drug trials alluded to in the movie and that Chuck had arranged the murder to cover things up.  I can't figure out why that motive wasn't played up.  If the drug trials on Richard's wife went awry and Chuck wanted to hide that fact, I think that would be a reason for Chuck and Sykes to bump her off.  That wasn't established until almost the end of the film.  There's a lot of good action, however, and the cast is stellar.  I haven't seen a lot of movies starring either Harrison or Tommy Lee, but both their performances in The Fugitive are powerful.  Sela Ward(of TV's \\"Sisters\\") has an understated but important role as Richard's wife, Helen, and Joe Pantoliano, who plays Sam's key investigator, provides some humorous moments.  All in all, if you want action, suspense, and drama, The Fugitive has all of them., suspense, and drama, The Fugitive has all of them.
0060930187|4.0|I had heard from a number of people that this was a book that was worth my time. It was a quick read, and it was pretty enjoyable. The description on the back cover of the book says it's about Plath's descent into insanity (&lt;-- not a direct quote). However, it wasn't much of a descent. It was more like, she wasn't insane at the end of one chapter, and at the beginning of another chapter she was suddenly insane.<br />Regardless, it was a pretty good book. Not spectacular, but interesting enough to hold my attention.

0399103422|5.0|This book essentially deals with the cosa notra and their many molls. The polished ways of the Italian immigrant who builds a family, and becomes its GODFATHER. The special style employed by Puzo, that is pacing the storyline back and forth, is also interesting. One Marvels at the mind of the Don and watches in acute horror as his son changes from a righteous soldier to a tough gangster who in turn becomes the next Godfather. The sub-plots and the sartorial comments on American Society make for a good read.<br />All in all, a great book. A classic.
B00009ATIX|1.0|This movie won my &quot;Worst of the year&quot; award. I thought this film had great potential, but it never lived up to its potential. I really wanted to see this movie, about after seeing it. I wish I had seen &quot;Dude Where's my car&quot; instead.
B00005JMTN|5.0|I saw Big Fish in the theater last week and fell in love with it.  You get wraped into the stories and feel like you're living through them yourself.  What made the movie so outstanding was the ending.  Absoluteley love it, my friends and I all walked out with tears in our eyes, and we were not alone.

If you're looking for a good cd for a road trip this is it.Buy it.
B0000AXE8I|1.0|It is hard to like a movie in which the characters go on and on with incomprehensible (I hope that's how you spell it) dialogue. It's hard to like a movie with the least appealling leading lady in history. It's hart to like a movie in which every character wears sunglasses in the darkest of enviroments. It's hard to like to a movie in which the hero suddenly discovers he can (inexplicably) fly.
B0000DZEA1|5.0|Howard Shore brings each of these movies to life with these amazing segments of music.  But I believe of the three soundtracks, this one wins.  Though the orchestra music of all of the movies is beautiful, added to this one there is the beautiful song done by Billy Boyd (Pippin) while Faramir rides towards Osgiliath and Viggo Mortenson's (Aragorn) Elven poem/song at his crowning as king of Gondor.  This soundtrack puts all others I've ever heard to shame.  You'll be sorry if you don't get it.

0385504209|4.0|The Da Vinci Code is an eminently readable book that is a tapestry of conspiracy theories arranged to create a mega-conspiracy theory.  While many of the theories are based upon half-truths, they are tied together in such a way to make the conspiracies seem plausible.  Brown presents this book as based on fact; in reality it is based on theory - and in many cases these theories are flimsy.  However, flimsy theories, when presented with confidence, are often the most entertaining theories.  Basically, this book is an effective escape from reality by an author with an anti-religion agenda - take the &quot;facts&quot; with a grain of salt.  The Da Vinci Code is action packed and filled with surprising revelations.  It's a quick and easy to follow read.  The chapters are brief and dramatic for those with short attention spans, and the overall package ties together well for a quick, interesting and exciting read.
B00005JLYW|5.0|If you're the kind of movie goer that can accept a heavy dose of movie logic and you don't mind seeing a movie for nothing more than just a movie, then Charlie's Angels:Full Throttle(unrated) will be fun and exciting for you. If you're the kind of movie goer that criticizes every little thing during the film and doesn't allow anything but the \\"possible\\", in every frame of every second, then this movie will be fun and exciting for you, too.<br />The action is fantastic and the special effects, except for 1 or 2, are amazing! I really thought that it was going to suck, but not even close!!! The first 5 minutes are worth the price of admission alone. Great camera work, pretty good drama, great comedy and tons of action & explosions. What more could you ask for? It makes most action movies look like super-snoozers.<br />To my surprise, I must say that I love this movie. CHARLIE'S ANGELS: FULL THROTTLE(unrated version), it's an honor to add you to my DVD collection. Okay...now I'm pushing it, but really, it's a pretty darn good movie. It's much better than the first one and it's a great escape.<br />*NOTE* you MUST disconnect yourself from reality to enjoy it. But isn't that what the movies are for, to get away? Now go have fun!
B000089CJI|5.0|From the iTunes Music Store where else??? The Postal Service's freshman album &quot;Give Up&quot; is nothing short of a musical tour de force. Really, it's that good. So good, it's almost criminal. Take the lyrical honesty of Death Cab and marry it with Jimmy Tamborello's &quot;Nintendo-esque&quot; keyboard sensibilities. The result is an absolutely smashing record that harkens back to the days of Depeche Mode and Yaz but with a more modern bent.<br />Tracks worth mentioning include:<br />1. The District Sleeps Alone Tonight - In my humble opinion this is the best song on the album. Starts off slow in almost a dream-like fashion then steadily increases, it's tempo culminating in a climax awash in keyboards and catchy drumbeats.<br />2. Such Great Heights - The most &quot;mainstream&quot; song here...thus the most accessible. Great melodies and lyrics abound in this track. Still not as good as Dntel's: &quot;This is the Dream of Evan and Chan&quot; but pretty damn close.<br />3. Sleepin in - Questionable lyrics mar this track, especially a cheesy reference to J.F.K. But a catchy chorus helps to redeem this one from mediocrity to pretty decent.<br />4. Nothing Better - One of my favorite numbers on this disc. Jenny Lewis and Ben Gibbard take turns in this one, an example of lyrical sparring at its very best.<br />9. Brand New Colony - Finally, the Super Mario theme song with added vocals!!! I never knew Mario could sing! All kidding aside, this song has some of the best lyrics on this album that compliment the &quot;Mario&quot; sound in perfect fashion.<br />After listening to this album on my ipod too many times to count, I have not grown tired of it yet. On the contrary...it seems to get better with every listen. In fact I am listening to it right now as I type.<br />Trust me, just buy this thing. There is &quot;nothing better.&quot;
B0000DD7LC|5.0|This is an excellent CD that anyone can enjoy and listen to. The Diary of Alicia Keys is a smooth and classy second effort. I never get tired of listening to it.
B0000DD7LB|5.0|Those who have written negative reviews of this album have clearly not heard it and are simply bashing it because of the artist attached to it!   If you judge this album based on the music, you will realize that it's quite good.   What makes the album so good is the variety of music presented, ranging from edgy dance songs like \\"Toxic\\" & \\"Me Against the Music\\" to more subdued and sexual songs like \\"Breathe on Me\\" & \\"Touch of my Hand.\\"   A wide range of musical tastes are satisfied, which ultimately makes this album great for repeated listening.   As far as pop music goes, you can't get much better than \\"In the Zone\\"!!   I highly recommend you pick it up!
B0000VAFO0|5.0|What a Great Howler, or is it Hisser?  AN EXCELLENT, SEVERELY UNDERRATED look into the contemporary world of the undead [although judging by their speed - we'ed never know].  &quot;Cute&quot; plot though almost Shakesperian in concept, gorgeous vampire hunter - err, she's a vampire and she hunts ... Lycos [werewolves].  Seems that 'the system' split a few centuries ago - one or other &quot;Romeo &amp; Juliet&quot; moment gone horribly wrong [but that's very hush-hush] - the 'hairies' went their butch way, and the 'hissies' swooshed off to their mansions.<br />The Lycos are kind of the wild biker-boy type today .... no &quot;Where Gals&quot; in site ..... the Vamps?  Well, that's what they kind of do - Vamp - skulk, lounge and just look like coked-out supermodels - draining the odd glass of red liquid [biting is so passe]<br />ANYHOO - Seline {Kate B.} out gal with brains and beauty feels that something's afoot and investigates why the Lycos are hunting a human [now there's a hidden agenda ...]  during this course she specacularly resurrects her Mentor/StepFather/LORD of the Vampires {he's been hi-teched in the basement of the mansion for a few centuries alongside another VampLord - also dormant}.<br />Transformations are good [they remind of Ancient Egypt the Anubis~Bastet dynasty] - and we are treated to a spectalular underground showdown.<br />Costumes, Set Decor, Music - all superior!<br />WORTHY OF A SEQUEL!
B0001BKAEY|4.0|\\"The Matrix\\" films were a lot of fun, and this triology will be remembered for a long time. Our kids will be watching these three movies! Each film has something differant about it that will make it cherished forever. The first movie in the series, \\"The Matrix\\", had a fantastic plot and origional comcepts with compelling drama and action! The second film, \\"The Matrix Reloaded\\", was in my opinion more fun than the first, even though you could not fully understand the plot with out seeing the third film, but the action was fantastic and plentiful. Now for the third film, \\"The Matrix Revolutions\\". Some people complain that this was a bad movie and I really hate it when thy do, because it is not! They did not like the battle, well hello what did you expect a negoations between humans and machines! There had to be a battle because they said it ever since the first movie! You can also tell by the title! Revolutions! The second and third films in this series were very missunderstood and I have no idea why, they fit like puzzle peices with the first! This is a great series and I recomend it to everyone!  <br />\\"The Matrix\\" is available now on DVD.<BR>\\"The Matrix Reloaded\\" is available now on DVD.<BR>\\"The Matrix Revolutions\\" is available APRIL 6TH on DVD<BR>(And I love the cover art, someone said they thought is lazy, whatever!)

B000001EG6|4.0|1970's \\"Elton John\\" is a terrific album that announced the dawning of a new decade's biggest star in neon lights. Its first track, \\"Your Song,\\" came out of absolutely nowhere that December to become Elton John's first Top Ten hit on the U.S. Billboard charts, peaking at #8, and even today it fills the speakers of a car stereo or a living room with the assurance of an old friend.<br /><br />How nice it is to hear that meandering yet spot-on piano tinkering, alongside an atypically humble and unpretentious lyric from one Bernie Taupin: \\"If I was a sculptor/But then again no/Or a man who makes potions/For a traveling show.\\" It's enough to forgive the irritating harpsichord of the next number, \\"I Need You To Turn To.\\"<br /><br />But only \\"First Episode At Hienton\\" after that is less that sparkling, and so much else about Elton's first big album (after the shakedown cruise of \\"Empty Sky\\") is brilliant. It's not the hitmaker U.S. audiences would so soon grow accustomed to, singing about alligators and astronauts so winningly, but a thoughtful musical craftsman who was still experimenting with what mass audiences might let him get away with.<br /><br />\\"Take Me To The Pilot\\" is the one rocker, and a good one, better than \\"Saturday Night's Alright For Fighting\\" if not some of his other big hits of later years. Those who love Elton the hitmaker will probably also treasure (as I do) such less heralded numbers as the Rolling Stones' tribute \\"No Shoe Strings On Louise\\" (Mick Jagger vocal mannerisms circa \\"Let It Bleed\\" abound), the mesquite-soaked \\"Border Song,\\" or \\"The Greatest Discovery,\\" one of the great love songs ever sung, though with a clever twist that only renders the actual subject matter more affecting. How often does one hear a song about the arrival of a younger sibling? (Well, there's \\"Lonely Boy\\" by Andrew Gold, but this is much more positive.)<br /><br />I can't get behind Elton here the way I can with \\"Don't Shoot Me, I'm Only The Piano Player\\" or \\"Captain Fantastic And The Brown Dirt Cowboy,\\" though it's probably a better though less representative album than at least the first of those. It's not Elton the way you and I would come to know him in a very short time, but an interesting variation that regarded lyrical depth as important as tuneful variation. The former Mr. Reg Dwight still had three more albums to go, including a live one, before nailing down his trademark winning piano-popster sound, but this was his first hurrah, and a big one, ironically so given it was so removed from the glam image he would so soon cultivate.<br /><br />If you are listening to Elton's hits and liking them, and want something else to turn to, I'd suggest \\"Captain Fantastic,\\" \\"Tumbleweed Connection,\\" and this album, which combined probably will leave you with no more than three or four key songs you've already heard and a number you ought to give a listen to. If you like any of the music Elton made through 1976, that is to say the best he ever did, you owe it to yourself to give his first hit record a spin. It still kicks more than 30 years on.astic And The Brown Dirt Cowboy,\\" though it's probably a better though less representative album than at least the first of those.

B000000W6X|5.0|This is Massive Attack's sophomore album, released in 1995 after their highly acclaimed debut, 1991's Blue Lines.  Although overshadowed by both its predecessor and 1998's Mezzanine, this album is just as good as both of them.  Tracey Thorn and Nicolette are arguably the best guest vocalists they used on any of their albums, maybe even a little bit better than Shara Nelson or Liz Fraser.  Not breaking new ground like their debut, or pure darkness like their third LP, but still worth the money.  Best tracks are the title track, &quot;Sly&quot;, and &quot;Spying Glass&quot;.
B00005JLWN|3.0|Highlights: Style; SFX; fight scenes; Christian Bale's performance<BR>Lowpoints: Underdeveloped characters/themes; choppy editing<br />Conclusion: This ain't Matrix, but this ain't no rip-off either. 'Equilibrium' might borrow some of its visual style from the Wachowskis' creation, but it holds its own as a futuristic tale about the corruption of society.<BR> Law states people are no longer allowed to feel, and have to periodically inject themselves with an anti-emotional vaccine. Bale's character works as one of the watchers, who delivers those who refuse to abide by the rules to 'the main guy'. One day, he doesn't take the pill, feels horrible about some killed dogs, and rises against the government. <BR> Okay, so there isn't much to the plot, but it's supported well by an emotional performance from Bale, astounding set designs, perfectly choreographed beautiful fighting scnes (the movie has its own extreme style of fighting, involving a lot of wireworks and computers). The finale isn't disappointing either - if you're looking for above-average action with an apparent social subtext, don't dismiss 'Equilibrium'.
B0000TB01Y|4.0|I agree with most of the other reviews of this soundtrack.  I am very passionate about musical theatre and I thought this soundtrack was superb.  All of the vocal performances were wonderful...Including Norbert Leo Butz.  I love his voice and I don't think he gets much credit...so here's to him!  Anyway, this soundtrack is wonderful and I would reccommend it to anyone who loves musical theatre!
B0000DJZA5|3.0|Let it be - naked is a major disappointment to anyone who can remember the original radio broadcasts of the Glyn Johns mix that was heard on radio stations in late '69 or early '70, that featured a great version of &quot;Dig it&quot; that ran for about 3 minutes. This version showed what the beatles were really trying to do with the album, raw, basic rock'n'roll that showed how good they really were in a natural unadorned atmosphere.<BR>I would suggest that anyone interested in how this should really sound, chase up a bootleg copy of the Glyn Johns mix with Save the last dance, Dig it, and also find the rock'n'roll medleys that were featured in the film.<BR>While its good to have this new album and its songs all cleaned up digitally, it could have been so much better by keeping some of the original atmosphere with the banter and the jams such as the previously mentioned &quot;Dig It&quot; (the whole jam goes for about 8 minutes!).<BR>Can't wait for the film to one day come out on DVD!
1577311523|5.0|After reading many many books by several empowering authors such as Deepak Chopra, Dr. Wayne Dyer, Dalai Lama, and Tiffany Snow, that I am still reading, my life has opened up to me in such a compelling and wonderful way. This new book is well written, and thought provoking. There are great transforming authors, who shift the consciousness of humankind in a way never known before. The &quot;Power of Now&quot; is one of those.
B0000DD7LC|5.0|This CD is so much better than her first offering, which was good too. She managed to fuse her signature piano soul style with more fierce hiphop beats, giving it an out of this world feel. With tracks like KARMA, YOU DON'T KNOW MY NAME, IF I WAS YOUR WOMAN and more, Alicia Keys is shining as an artist, not as an entertainer and definitely not as product, contrary to more popular &quot;artists&quot; like Britney Spears and the &quot;not famous anymore singer&quot; Mandy Moore.<br />This is the type of cd you'd be listening too even by next year. Its clearly a masterpeice, even the sleeves speak out art.<br />I have nothing bad to say about this cd, Buy it. Its worth you money.
B000001ES9|3.0|Back in 1973 bands like Cream, Black Sabbath, Led Zeppelin, Pink Floyd, Eric Clapton ruled the airwaves. It is from this foundation of music the early roots of RUSH can clearly be heard. As legend has it back in 1968 Geddy Lee, Alex Lifeson, & (then drummer) John Rutsey were sitting around in a coffee shop somewhere in Toronto trying to come up with a catchy band name, when John's older broth suggested the \\"caffiene inspired soundbite\\" that would forever give him the un-official bragging rights. Who would of thought this simple rock & roll trio, & subsequent debut album called \\"RUSH\\" would mark the beginning of a 30 year recording career that would make rock & roll history. It's obvious from the first riffs of \\"Finding My Way\\" \\"Need Some Love\\" & \\"Take a Friend\\" this was a band that had no real deep classic rock concepts or agendas to serve-up other that good old \\"smoke filled room\\" rock & roll. From the bluesy riffs of \\"Here Again\\" to old time RUSH favorites like \\"In the Mood\\" & \\"Working Man\\" this album proves to be a real consistent barn burner from begining to end. HERE'S THE BOTTOM LINE - This debut album by \\"RUSH\\" may prove to be too rough around the edges, for some \\"Concept Heavy\\" RUSH fans out there who prefer the polished lyrical styles, complex drum syncopations, & advanced musical progressions. If you are one of those fans, like me who is spoiled rotton by the classic side of RUSH this album may prove to be just a little too low on your IQ scale. But if you are a person who thoroghly enjoys old 70's rock & roll, & loves the likes of Led Zeppelin, Jimmy Page, Creme, The New Yardbirds, & Eric Clapton, this album will prove to be a perfect fit, & will always keep the \\"Working Man\\" \\"In The Mood\\". ...
B000002L5I|5.0|Simply put, Kenny Wayne Shepherd is an AMAZING guitarist. I Highly reccomend purchasing this CD.
B00003CXB4|5.0|I agree with almost everyone on here that &quot;Morning Report&quot; is really bad. It just clutters up the extended editon on the movie and really should not have been made. <br /> The other extras though are amazing such as &quot;Bug Football&quot; and the &quot;Virtual Safari&quot; which is really more oriented for younger kids but even adults may enjoy some of these extras too. <br /> The movie itself is a timeless classic about a lion cub named Simba whose father Mufasa is the king of Pride Rock but his traitorous uncle, brother of Mufasa, kills Mufasa by sending him down into a valley to his death, and Simba, believeing that he is responsible for Mufasa's death, flees into exile while his evil Uncle Scar takes over Pride rock and the lion pride goes into ruin. <br /> Now as a fully grown lion, Simba has to face his past in order to restore Pride Rock back into glory and defeat his evil uncle Scar. He meets the excellent meerkat Timon and warthog Pumbaa and the unforgettable &quot;Akuna Matata&quot; song comes to mind. <br /> This is a really excellent film and the DVD edition is really good but &quot;Morning Report&quot; is just atrocious and should not have been included on here. <br /> A DVD worth owning.

B0001Z52RU|2.0|I had seen and read previews for THE BUTTERFLY EFFECT and was really intrigued. I thought the movie would offer something along the lines of the famous Ray Bradbury story. Boy, was I ever wrong.<br /><br />The movie is, well it's just a movie. But it's the first time in a long time that I actually considered walking out of the theatre. The convoluted plot begins near the end of the film, then flashbacks thirteen years before in time. Ashton Kutcher's character is a child who starts suffering from blackouts and has brain bleeding, similar to his father (who lives in a mental institution). Kutcher's character soon learns that he can travel back through time by reading journals from his youth. He has to concentrate on what he is doing and he is only able to travel back in his own life and control his former self. That doesn't really make any sense and the movie doesn't either. I guess the best way to describe it is a cross between SOMEWHERE IN TIME and BEING JOHN MALKOVICH.<br /><br />The movie doesn't really make any sense. I heard several people say near the end of the film, &#34;I have no idea what is going on.&#34; Also, the film is such a bizarre blend, that it just left the audience confused. For instance, there were several times in the movie that were clearly meant to be serious, but not in a shocking way: several people were laughing and several people were gasping in shock. Of course, besides all the confusion, there's also the fact that the film doesn't remain true to logic. For instance, Kutcher's character goes back in time to the exact same period of his childhood at least two times. His character performs different actions all three times, which makes no sense whatsoever. As for the &#34;big questions&#34; this movie supposedly raises, it really doesn't ask any. It just appears that it does, kind of like a political candidate appearing to answer a question without really answering it.<br /><br />Just trying to write about the movie is confusing and is gives me a headache. I would recommend staying away from this film at all costs because it really is a waste of your time (the only things worthwhile in the film are Kutcher and Amy Smart and the eerie musical score). However, if you do see it, be forewarned--you won't be able to travel back and repair your &#34;mistake&#34;.ves me a headache.

B00007LTIA|3.0|TALES FROM TOPOGRAPHIC OCEANS is a musical journey littered with millions of corpses of listeners who died trying to reach the finish line, hence fathom it's amazing energy &amp; powerful hidden meaning. Sadly most of you don't come equipped with the mental hardware to even appreciate it. But when approached correctly the magic of this album will open itself to you like a pandoras box &amp; pour it' energy into your psyche like a waterfall. It's true most of you would gladly take your &quot;roundabout chiken nuggets&quot; over this 4 course delight. But I consider myself an elite listener, one who ranks among the few who can not only make it to the finish line, but become one with it's creator in understanding it's hidden meaning. Here's my 5 step approach to TFTTO...........listen carefully<br />1 - Have an 80 minute listening window free from even the slightest distractions.<BR>2 - Listen in total darkness, with headphones to maximize the listening senses.<BR>2 - Sip on a tripple expresso to increase your staying power.<BR>3 - Pretend you are Lance Armstrong on a musical IRONMAN<BR>4 - Now listen, concentrate, &amp; submerge yourself into the music. Do not attempt to understand, just absorb one note at a time &amp; enjoy the scenery.<BR>5 - Do this 3 times over a 7 day period. By the third listen it will reveal it's hidden meaning to you.<br />If by then you still don't get it take my advice............. &amp; go back to your 90125 nipple cuz your training wheels are not ready to come off yet.<br />Michael Rhodes<BR>rhodesm@charter.net
B00000IPAX|5.0|This has got to be their best, follwed by Take off your pants. I love these guys. And I'm almost 40. Anthem, Stay together for the kids. The whole album is brillant and fun. On record, this is the best rock band in the world.
B00009V8Z9|5.0|As the lyrics say in the song &quot;Ohh Chariot&quot; this is a great CD. Degraw has a very Billy Joel young urban rock voice, that really stands out from the crowd. His lyrics are very interesting and thought provoking, comparable to Jack Johnsons' songs.  Chariot is a mellow CD with some great thoughts and messages interlaced through lyrics and his AWESOME piano playing skills.  This is an excellent CD, that compliments other singer/songwriters such as John Mayer, Dave Matthews, Jack Johnson, Jason Mraz and even Liz Phair.
B0001AVZA8|5.0|Jack Nicholson is simply outstanding in this hilarious comedy featuring an aging entrepreneur who develops a relationship with a playwright, played by Diane Keaton.  There are a number of scenes with Jack as the focal point that made me laugh aloud longer than any other movie I have ever seen in my life.  A must see/buy movie!!!
B000084T18|1.0|With the exception of Eminem's 2 verses, this is an absolutely stupid album, with no backbone, no lyrical skill, no topic, and absolutly no creativity or thought put into it...i wonder how long it took 50 to think about ..\\"... I think Many Men is a good track on the album. And the only 50 Cent line that is worth quoting:<br />\\"If you were smart, you'd be shook of me<BR>'Cause i tired of looking for you, <BR>.
B00005QDW1|1.0|Man what a farse.  Take a very average rock song like Hella Good, and just ram it down everyone's throats 50,000 times a day on every friggin radio station.  Surprisingly when I confront others about the epidemic of hearing this No Doubt album dreadfully overplayed on the radio, the response is always, &quot;huh, I never hear that No Doubt song on the radio&quot;.  Are you idiots friggin kidding me??? Its not that good!  You all know it!  Gwen Stefani is rich off terribly average No Doubt songs!  The music industry intends to make everything 15 year old girl friendly and aleviate people like me who question the fact that all your friggin No Doubts and Outkasts do not care about being different and effective and interesting, &quot;Rock Steady&quot; makes me wonder, Gwen, are you the same person that sang &quot;I Saw Red&quot; with Bradley of Sublime???
B000000OUJ|5.0|This is a classic. My desert island Wu-Tang pick, simply because everyone else would be packing '...36 Chambers.' And maybe they'd be right...<br />Liquid Swords- It's one of those albums that bring people into hip-hop, one of those albums that I buy used whenever I see a copy for under 5 bucks, simply so I can give it as a present to a friend who 'doesn't get hip hop.' It's also one of the few hip hop albums that I have on dual formats (CD and vinyl) and tracked down the instrumentals too. It's just that good. It's dark, macabre, over the top and surreal. The RZA's production is top notch, The samples and beats are spare, gritty, rambling, odd- this is ANTI-P.Diddy music. The myriad kung-fu interludes for once don't work against the overall thematic drive, in fact, they heighten the album's doomed theatrics. The whole thing works perfectly. My brother and I have played many games of chess to this masterpiece. Good also for jogging, lifting, washing dishes, playing cards, driving long distancxes with friends chanting the lyrics...<br />which reminds me- Lyrically, this is just on a different plane. NO ONE sounds like the GZA- he's one of those inimitable individuals who can't help but rock his own way. His flow and verbosity are seldom matched in the arenas of today. I'd say he's up there with KRS-ONE, Guru, Black Thought, Kool G Rap, early Ice Cube, and other originators of all vocal variety.<br />The GZA ties out with Ghostface as my fave Wu-Tang MC, but Liquid Swords is a far better, denser, tighter, diamond hard album than Ironman (even despite the Al Green samples). Now then- Supreme Clientelle... hmmmm...<br />In short- all of the best elements of early Wu-Tang, perfectly entwined. If you only have a handful of 'rap' Cds make this one of them!!!!
0679745653|5.0|I re-read this book and was pleased to find that I wasn't wrong about it the other million times I read it. Truman Capote is one of my favorite authors and Breakfast at Tiffany's is my all-time favorite American classic. I don't read about Holly Golightly, I absorb this unique, eccentric character. The message Mr. Capote conveys in this novel is one of poignancy and charm. Holly, like her nameless cat, is a free spirit, a young woman whose quirks and unconventional lifestyle endear everyone, including the ambiguous narrator. This book overwhelms me with sadness every time I read it. Ms. Golightly's elusiveness touches me every time. I also love the film version of this novel. But the story gets lost somewhere amid the chemistry between Audrey Hepburn and George Peppard. Peppard plays the narrator, and his character loses the mystery and ambiguity that is evident in the book. And even though I love the film's ending, the novel's conclusion is unforgettable. There are various differences between the book and the film, but they're both classics in their unique way. If you've seen the movie but haven't read the book, I strongly suggest you pick it up. Truman Capote is a brilliant writer, and he outdid himself with this timeless gem.
0385504209|4.0|Being anavid reader I do not understand the popularity of this book.<br />It is a good book and if its handy read it.<br />There are so many books in fantasy fiction as well as fiction that are a better read than this that do not get the aclaim that is due.<br />The general public, as a whole, do not read.  Given that; friends tell there friends, &quot;Hey read this, its great.&quot;<br />The public do not have a basis for suggested reading.  Pulp fiction like Grisham and best sellers are the rule, sadly.<br />I read this book a year ago and I still here bookstore sellers touting this book.  I gave it four stars, its a good book.<br />It would not be in my top 100 best reads.  Forgive me for this odd review.  Needed to get an issue off my chest.(bad axiom)
0783240287|4.0|I have the video but not the DVD I would buy the DVD but it is in WIDESCREEN and I HATE WIDESCREEN! I agree with a lot of you I love the music but some of the costumes was a little much.

B000000HSU|5.0|Bad Brains define hardcore. They invented (Roir-release and Rock for Light) and then refined (I against I, Quickness) it, leaving everyone else sitting in the dirt and scratching their jowls. Listen to this and then try listening to some other punk or hardcore band... Yeah... I know. What else can I say?<br />It's just depressing how damn good they were.
B000099T2L|4.0|The album is hot!  The song, &quot;Me, Myself and I&quot;  is incredible!  It has helped me through a tough time in my life.  Each time I hear it, it feels like the first.  It reminded me of the first time I heard &quot;&quot;Survivor&quot;, I mean the lyrics, made me aware of inner strength I didn't realize I had.  For that, I thank Ms Beyonce, you go girl...you put it down, once again.  I wish her continued success, after all it's warranted, she's talented.  And to think, people were comparing this chic to Ashanti!  Pahleeeeessse!!!!!!!!!

0316777722|3.0|Author David Sedaris weaves a series of lighthearted anecdotal essays into an amusing and somewhat engaging book.  Well written, the book flows easily.  But I have to admit that unlike many of the previous Amazon.com reviewers I did not find \\"Me Talk Pretty One Day\\" to be particularly laugh-out-loud funny.  Amusing and entertaining, yes.  A smirk and a smile every now and then.  But it's more like a good walk and a bright sunny day.  Very enjoyable but not tremendously memorable.  Good if you are looking for something easy to pass the time.
0440180295|5.0|\\"Slaughterhouse-Five\\" is brilliant because Kurt Vonnegut is NOBODY'S apologist.  You may disagree with his politics (and I definitely do), but his story of Billy Pilgrim, a hapless World War II veteran  who lives in several parallel timelines, is a masterwork.<br />Vonnegut was actually there.  He was a POW in Dresden when it was bombed into the stone age.  He witnessed its effects first-hand.  He even wrote himself into \\"Slaughterhouse-Five\\" as a background character.<br />Personally, I think story-behind-the-story is that Pilgrim is the author, or a part of him that splintered off. Billy Pilgrim's was a fragile mind that came unhinged because he saw too much.  His leaps of fancy, which are written as though real, are the product of a mind stressed beyond its breaking point.<br />Kurt Vonnegut, unlike Pilgrim, did not suffer a break with reality. Instead he chose to part with it on his own terms - as a novelist.  I would imagine that there are only so many civilian corpses - woman and children chief among them - you can stack on bonfires before you start to question your own sanity - and the sanity of the people responsible.<br />What he offers in \\"Slaughterhouse-Five\\" (and in every novel of his I've read) is not a condemnation of a particular group (i.e., Americans) but of the human race as a whole.  Necessity does not make atrocities any less horrific.  Killing is killing.  Though it may be justified in some sense (in the case of self-defense, or the defense of others), it is no less an act of destruction.  Morally speaking, war punishes the victor, too.<br />Vonnegut's argument, as I read it, is that we need to stop thinking of any war as justified or necessary.  War is neither. It is simply a fact of human nature that aggressors will attack others, and that we must sometimes act to stop them.  That we shouldn't have to in the first place is, I think, the whole point of the book.  It's insanity to incinerate people by the thousands.  That  the axis forces did it first makes it no less so.  That it may have been necessary in some way only shifts the blame.  No one who commits such acts  - even for the greater good - has a clean conscience, except people who are clinically insane.<br />In short, there is a distinction to be made between the morality of going to war, and the morality of war itself.  I think Kurt Vonnegut sees this.  If you don't, then it's all the more reason to read this book.id it first makes it no less so.  That it may have been necessary in some way only shifts the blame.

B000002I4W|5.0|Ornette Coleman is a name frequently associated with the very challenging world of avante-garde jazz. But The Shape Of Jazz To Come, while certainly revolutionary and groundbreaking, is not difficult music at all to listen to. Later records such as 1960's Free Jazz would fit that bill, but this is a splendidly accessible post-bop jazz album. Even people who hate Coleman's later work and the whole concept of free jazz (I'm sort of mixed on the idea myself) will probably love this.<br /><br />The main breakthrough of this album is the idea of implied chords. Rather than placing a conventional chord under each note, Coleman chooses instead to only imply the existence of the chord and in so doing leaves open many different possible melodies to improvise with. While this could seemingly invite chaotic dissonance within the framework of a quartet, the band plays with fluidity throughout. Every track is full of easy melodies, which is not something you could say for a lot of Coleman's other albums.<br /><br />Of course, when you have a band this talented (Don Cherry on trumpet, Charlie Haden on bass, Billy Higgins on drums) it shouldn't come as too much of a surprise. Each player is among the cream of the crop on their respective instruments, and Ornette himself is no slouch either. Every track is a stone-cold classic--the elegant opener Lonely Woman, hard bop numbers like Eventually, Focus On Sanity, and Congeniality, the graceful ballad Peace, and the solid closer Chronology.<br /><br />Along with other landmark jazz albums released in 1959 (Giant Steps, Kind Of Blue, Time Out etc.) this is vital to the casual listener's collection and the one Coleman disc I'd reccommend to even a novice jazzer. At the same time, if you are a fan of later Coltrane, Sun Ra, Dolphy etc. this is where it all started, so dig in and enjoy.
B00008DDSC|5.0|I will not get to much into the plot or a bio on the movie Secretary. I'm guessing you all know pretty much all about that by now. But I will tell you what I got from this movie. Secretary was by far one of the best movies I have watched in a very long time if not ever. I've found myself to be a huge fan of Maggie Gyllenhaal &amp; James Spader... Although I have been a huge fan of James Spader from movies like Stargate, The Stickup, Tuff Tuff, Crash, and many others... I left this movie with a lot of things. But the biggest one was a new huge curiosity of the BDSM lifestyle. I've never been curious of alternate lifestyles or relationships until seeing this movie, or maybe I have and this movie has just brought it to light. For whatever the reason I know I'm now very much so attracted to the lifestyle. This movie has actually given me a true representation of this lifestyle, almost a look on the inside in ways.. I have now looking back on the movie and knowing what I know now about the lifestyle found a lot of the movie to be true look at this hidden or somewhat unknown culture and lifestyle. I for one thank Steven Shainberg for his directing in this great movie and give it 2 thumbs up. A must in any great dvd collection.
B000002ORL|5.0|Maybe I love this music so much because I grew up watching this movie all the time, but these songs move me like no other music I know. This is a nice CD, good recording, average case/contents.
B000001GQB|5.0|The best symphonic music of the greatest composer of all time conducted by the best interpreter of Mozart in the modern era.  What more can I say?
B000002GJH|4.0|Temple Of The Dog was intended from the beginning as a one-shot deal. It was the result of the unfortunately premature death of Andy Wood (lead singer of Seattle glam/grunge outfit Mother Love Bone). Many people were shaken by the death of Wood, including friend and former roommate Chris Cornell, vocalist of Soundgarden. In 1991, the remaining members of Mother Love Bone--Mike McCready, Stone Gossard, and Jeff Ament (if you're a fan of one Pearl Jam, those names should be VERY familiar)--teamed up with Cornell and virtuoso drummer Matt Cameron to form Temple Of The Dog. Cornell already came up with two songs--Say Hello 2 Heaven and Reach Down. The band wrote more material and it eventually grew to a full jam session. As stated in the liner notes, &quot;just music to make music.&quot; Wish more bands would do this nowadays.<br />This album is without question a classic. Stylistically it is a fusion of early Pearl Jam with Soundgarden (no surprise there). Of note is an absolutely glorious performance by Cornell--not only does he unleash his full-borne screaming pipes, but also some incredibly delicate and gorgeous singing that absolutely bleeds emotion. I've always been a fan of Cornell, and I don't think he's ever topped his showing here (not even on other Soundgarden albums). McCready, Gossard, and Ament all put in good showings. While Cameron's drumming doesn't quite approach the level he would attain on later Soundgarden albums, he is still quite impressive here. Check out the neat time signatures and percussion on Wooden Jesus as an example.<br />Say Hello 2 Heaven is a great opener. The psychedelic jam of Reach Down is another superb track, though the noodling in the middle may tire some. Pushin' Forward Back and Four Walled World are great rockers, while Times Of Trouble has unparalleled lyrical poignancy. Wooden Jesus is lyrically very much a Soundgarden song, criticizing televangelism, though the delivery is a lot less scathing than Jesus Christ Pose off of Badmotorfinger.<br />My two favorite songs are Hunger Strike and All Night Thing. The former (a radio hit) is especially notable for featuring a cameo by Eddie Vedder. Cornell and Vedder trade and harmonize their vocals in a soul-searing performance. The latter closes the album on a subdued, sad ballad that echoes in my mind long after the album is over.<br />Weak points? Both Call Me A Dog and Your Saviour kinda drag, though calling them &quot;filler&quot; might be a little harsh. All in all, Temple Of The Dog was a fitting wake for Andy Wood, and in a way also predicted the future of Pearl Jam. All fans of the '90s Seattle scene are advised to check this album out, along with Mother Love Bone's Stardog Champion.ff of Badmotorfinger. <br />My two favorite songs are Hunger Strike and All Night Thing.

B0000DD7LB|3.0|Britney Spears is one of today's most prolific artists. While fellow Musketeer Christina Aguilera has opted for the Janet Jackson way of releasing one album with multiple radio singles (5 for Stripped), Spears is less concerned with dominating the airwaves these days. Instead, she tries her hands at being multi-faceted and -dimensional.<br /><br />On a strategy that started with her last album, Britney, In The Zone sees Britney releasing her most club-/street-ready album yet. Employing the help of top-notch producers like Moby, R Kelly and Guy Sigsworth, the album realizes its intentions at some points but fall flat at others. First single Me Against The Music features Madonna who undoubtedly stole the limelight despite an average single. Britney, on the other hand, tries too much of a Janet Jackson and comes across as ever so indecipherable with her mumbling (which incidentally is frequently repeated in other songs).<br /><br />The best tracks here are definitely: Early Morning with Moby's trademark electronic touches, Everytime with Guy Sigsworth luscious production and Touch of My Hand. One might wonder if it's truly Britney's brillance at work here that makes these songs good or if they are the result of the solid work by the producers. R Kelly and Ying Yang Twins lend their hands too but Britney just doesnt cut as a R&amp;B/hip-hop singer. As such, the album borders on being patchy in terms of material and delivery.<br /><br />Since Baby One More Time, crititcs have commented on how Britney will outlast her 15 minutes of fame. Nearly 5 years on, she's still in the zone abeit declining sales with each album released. Trying her best at altering the direction of her songs, Britney has evolved despite still not being very clear which way to go. Her career can go either way for now. To mimick her idol, Madonna, is not easy. Radio isnt giving her the support she much needs but if this album is any indication of future things to ome, Britney might just hold a surprise for all with her 5th album. Oh ya, Britney, try not to mumble.for all with her 5th album. Oh ya, Britney, try not to mumble.
B000088E6D|5.0|If 'Juno' music like I know music (pardon my pun) Michael Bublé deserves to be recognized for his work on this cd. <BR>He covers a wide range of timeless classics (13 tracks) and makes the 'old' new again. This cd has also introduced so many wonderful songs to a generation that has not heard this music. A gift to them... <BR>   What remains most impressive with his voice is that it is uncomparable to others - he has 'his' sound, and I find it warming and so comforting. Other adjectives come to mind as well - strong, pure, passionate, unique, honest, rich - and the list could go on and on. My sincere hope is that Bublé will receive the recognition he so rightly deserves for his amazing debut. <br />   'Juno' what I mean??
6304711875|5.0|I'd like to begin my review by clarifying a few things about some other reviewers' complaints. First of all, &quot;SCREAM&quot; is not a &quot;rip-off&quot; of previous slasher flics. Actually, it is an homage to them. It clearly knows that it is using the same situations as some previous horror movies, and it humorously pokes fun at its slasher-genre routes. Secondly, it is original, as much as it spoofs other movies. Because, you see, in this movie, the characters KNOW they are in a horror movie, and they have some knowledge of what to do and what not to do in this kind of situation. Once the &quot;rules&quot; of a scary movie are stated, they begin breaking all of them, and that is a twist. Another twist is the ending, which I won't give away, but let me just say it was very well done (although it was VERY violent). This movie is marvelous. The acting (including Drew Barrymore, Neve Campbell, Skeet Ulrich, Jamie Kennedy, Rose McGowan, Courtney Cox, David Arquette, Matthew Lillard, and cameo of Henry Winkler) is exquisite, the writing is comical and horrifying at the same time, and horror veteran Wes Craven directs excellently. The thrills and chills are actually GENUINE. It's very frightening and ominous at times, but the humor will make it fun for people to watch. There is a lot of blood, though, and most of it is chillingly realistic, so be ware, seriously. The DVD features are very good, including a very engrossing commentary by Wes Craven and brilliant screenwriter Kevin Williamson, lots of trailers, and more!
B000003TAR|3.0|its got awesome heavy songs and good sounding songs but Nevermind was the better of the two im sorry lol
B000001FAW|5.0|I purchased this disc after getting Andy Gibbs' Collection, which lit the fire for me to confront my \\"guilty pleasure\\"! The musicianship on this album is excellent, and it's a shame the Bee Gees have been panned over the years for their \\"disco\\" sound. The remarkable re-invention of their style from soft rock to R&B influenced music is astounding in itself, and this album is an easy listen. Like many other reviewers, I think \\"Subway\\" is the gem here, I hadn't heard this song before, and it reached out and grabbed me. I could almost see the song being done by the Four Tops or another 70's soul group, the song cooks! The tight harmonies, great bass work, and horns fill the album with enough twists and turns to keep you from getting bored. The Ballads will get you singing along trying too match Barry's falsetto. The album was not meant to be a work of art, just fun music. I excuse those negative reviewers who were looking for something else. But with each listen to this album, the appreciation for the talents of the Bee Gees will be enhanced. Check it out if you're 40+ like me, find a quiet spot, turn it up, and escape to a happier time!
0452282152|5.0|This book was sooooo good.  It is just a book that captures you and you do not want to put down the book.  Just to think that this person, Vermeer, was a real person.  After i finished reading it i looked up the picture on the internet.  It seriously captures you and you can't take your eyes away from the painting.  It is just amazing to think that you are looking at a very realistic picture of someone in the 1600's.  It just blows my mind away.  I strongly suggest reading this book.  It is so good and i could read it over and over again.  You are sad when it is over.

B000002H70|5.0|This album is simply amazing.  All the songs are so powerful and full of such real emotions.  I'm the type of person who just can't cry, no matter what, it just doesn't happen, but this album makes me tear up every time I listen to it.  My favorite song, on the record, is &quot;Pictures Of You,&quot; because of its increadable beauty and because it speaks so deeply to me (I think anyone who has gone through a painful break-up can relate to it).  I recommed that if you don't own this album you buy it right this instant.
B0000CFW87|5.0|This is an amazing album, but that's no surprise, as Josh Groban is an AMAZING singer!  When I first saw him on Ally McBeal, (The Wedding) my jaw was hanging and I was choking up through his whole song.  Sadly, I missed his second appearance on the show.  Time passed, and one day my boss came in and started telling me about a singer she saw on PBS the night before, and sent me out looking for his CD.  When I realized who he was, I had to have his music for myself!  I was thrilled when Closer came out-more Josh is a great thing, after all.<br />He blows me away! I was irate by a review of this album in a major magazine (starts with a &quot;P&quot;) saying his songs are maudlin and that he should stick to Italian and Spanish songs.  What a load of BS!  His love songs are moving and beautiful, and Josh could sing ANYTHING and still sound great.<br />He is young and yet by no means a &quot;cocky teenager&quot; type unlike some other young singers these days, who sing songs about being an invisible stalker.  I don't care how you cut it, and I'm aware of the metaphoric aspect, but the lyrics are just plain creepy.  Does anyone like the idea of being watched by an invisible person in their room?  Eek! Yuk! That review compared Josh to aforementioned cocky singer.  Laughable!  His voice is good enough (nothing super special) but I'd like to hear that kid sing what Josh sings.<br />Also, Josh was discovered purely on talent, and didn't need to be an exhibitionist and go on national TV hopping around and being flashy to be discovered.  He was discovered first, then ended up on TV in a beautiful, sedate special.  Josh feels his music, he doesn't just belt it out.<br />I love this CD, and plan to play several songs from it at my wedding.  &quot;When You Say You Love Me&quot; will be our first dance.
0345298349|5.0|&quot;Gorky Park&quot; came out in 1981, so some of the Cold War references to the KGB and the bad old days are dated, but it remains a top-notch thriller.  Arkady Renko is a Soviet cop called in to solve a triple murder, with the bodies left under the snow in a Moscow park.  As he probes deeper, he bumps into the KGB, a wealthy American fur trader, and a high-level conspiracy dating back to World War II.  Cruz Smith spent eight years writing the text, and it shows.  The eye for detail, the Moscow street scenes, the historical research and the multi-layered characters all feel first-hand and urgent.  That &quot;Gorky Park&quot; is a cut above other espionage/thriller novels made it a best-seller when it came out and a decent film with William Hurt.
B00004I9VE|3.0|I've had the vinyl and regular CD versions of Thriller for years and looked forward to hearing it on a multichannel SACD.  Imagine my disapointment to discover it was remastered only into stereo.  My wife didn't know that before she bought it for me for Christmas.  The SACD version sounds great, but I don't think significantly better than the regular CD version.  Get this if you don't already have a CD copy of version, but don't get it if you have multichannel audio capability and are looking for a new listening experience.
0385504209|2.0|I read Brown's DaVinci Code only because several friends had said that they were reading it and I felt I needed to read it before forming my own opinion.  I agreed with many of them that Brown's sotry was captivating, but needed to remind them that it is, in fact, fiction.  He has taken well resarched historical events and interpreted them in such a way to almost make one believe that this is how things &quot;must have&quot; happened.  One example is the Council of Nicaea, which was a real historical event, but to say that Christ's divinity was established then, is blatantly incorrect.  If he were to have read any of the Old or New Testament, he would find that  references to the divinity of Jesus Christ run throughout. To mention just a few - Mathhew 16:16, 1John 1:5-7, Acts 3:12-16 and on and on. His followers most definitely did know that He was the Son of God (divine).  I gave it 2 stars only for Brown's ability to captivate his audience, but I regret that there will be people reading it who will combine his historical research with his &quot;interpetation, which is totally fiction, and assume it all to be truth.  Not a book I would recommend.
B00006CXSS|5.0|Great series. You will watch over and over. It is of course very violent, but that's what war was all about. War wasn't glamorous, it was hell on earth and we should be proud of all the soldiers that gave their lives. 10 episodes, 1 hour each, beautifully made and with very good acting. Do not let it go, you won't regret it. I truly respect Steven Spielberg and Tom Hanks for doing something like this.

B000068TP0|5.0|Mtv Unpluuged first off is a great way to hear a artist like you never heard them before, and in this case Shakira shines,<BR> Shakira has a innocent sensuality  about her along with a power set of pipes , her voice is amazing, sharp clear and powerful,add these together and you have nothing less then a great DVD and concert, even if you dont understand Spanish, the music itself is entertaining,  from upbeat tunes like CIEGA SORDOMUDA on to ballads like TU, Shakira delivers and a powerful crisp way, you can FEEL the PASSION in her music.<BR>The only thing I could ask for more, is I wish it was longer.<BR>I am Shakira fan from hearing her first CD .. &quot;DO'NDE ESTAN LOS LADRONES, I also highly recommend her newer Cd .. LAUNDRY SERVICE,<BR>which is in English. (Spanish or English she rocks !)<BR>This is a very young and talented  performer, I hope she releases Tour of the Mongoose DVD soon,<BR>as it will combine all albums in to one great show.<BR>This concert ( mtv unplugged) features mandolins ,harmonica, piano , several types of guitars , gongs and horns.<BR>A truly great and entertaining concert with out a lot of mess, pure Shakira as she shines.    Enjoy !   :]
B000050XY8|5.0|I jsut want to warn you all to slam on the brakes to avoid being duped into thinking that this item is a 'collector's set'.<br /> I got this as a gift for my birthday in 2002 to replace a DVD of this movie that was stolen but I am just dissapointed with this item. I was expecting a very large stash of goodies but all I got was just two posters and just one, that's right ONE DISC!! Only one extra that was a second disc of behind the scenes footage and while it's great, I feel sorry for the person who ended up spending so much more money on just so little extra stuff.<br /> This is a great item and the movie is just incredible but the title is misleading. Good thing that it's only a &quot;Limited Edition&quot; but there isn't enough that warrants spending and extra five thousand pennies on this set.<br /> Stick with your older DVDs or wait until a possible MATRIX box set containing all three movies &quot;Matrix&quot;, &quot;Matrix Reloaded&quot;, and &quot;Matrix Revolutions&quot; comes out. You'll be much better buying that instead of this so-called &quot;Collector's Set&quot;.<br /> A total dissapointment. I'm only giving this a five star just because the movie is great.
B000002GVO|5.0|Length - 43:23<BR>Is there a greater song capturing the spirit of the 70s than Hotel California? Probably not. But what makes Hotel California (the album) so great is that the title track isn't all it has to offer. There are ballads, rockers and even an orchestral reprise. This recording covers an extraordinary amount of ground in a seemingly brief 43 minutes. But the 43 minutes translates to a mesmerizing longevity- weeks upon weeks will these songs remain in your head. Although the two songs that I can take or leave are favorites among most Eagles fans (Life in the Fast Lane and Victim of Love), there really aren't any dull points on the whole album. Hotel California is, and will remain a consummate, prevailing cult and commercial favorite. My personal favorites include the title track, Hotel California, the softly harmonic New Kid in Town and the touching Pretty Maids All in a Row. I recommend this to all.
B00003CXB2|5.0|Simply one of the greatest films ever made, starring the greatest British actor of all time, Obi Wan Kenobi himself.  See it or miss out on a grand adventure.
B000002KD9|5.0|Length - 35:09<BR>It's apparent that profound thoughts were swirling all through Neil Young's head when he recorded After The Gold Rush, an incredibly deep and beautiful album. From the very first verse of Tell Me Why, (Sailing heart-ships through broken harbors, out on the waves in the night, Still the searcher must ride the dark horse, racing alone in his fright. Tell me Why, Tell me why.) I become overwhelmed by an uncanny blend of feelings- nostalgia, solititude and a somewhat bittersweet sense of joy. It's strange what great music does to you. Although the lyrics at times can be esoteric, the music is always right there, lilting and swaying, conveying the feeling of the songs accurately. To me, this album is, quite parodoxically, enigmatic and distant, and at the same time, warm and intimate. The highs and lows (lows as in feeling low, not bad music- I love this entire record) of this album are acutely poignant, and there is not one piece of filler inbetween the mastery exhibited on such tracks as After The Gold Rush, Only Love Can Break Your Heart and Don't Let Tt Bring You Down. My favorite moments of the record include the sharp satirizing of Southern Man, the crestfallen lines of &quot;It's Over, It's Over&quot; on Birds, the wonderful &quot;It's only castles burning&quot; refrain of Don't Let it Bring You Down, and the whimsical coda, Cripple Creek Ferry. This is, without a doubt, one of the greatest recordings of its musically fruitful generation. I recommend it to everyone.
B0000DD7LC|5.0|Two years ago, it was Alicia Keys madness here in the United States of America.  She won tons of Grammys, \\"Fallin'\\", the first single off Ms. Key's debut album, \\"Songs In A Minor\\" was being played every twenty minutes on the radio, etc., etc.  Clearly, everyone and his grandmother thought that Alicia Keys was the best thing since sliced bread.  I attempted to join this craze.  For Easter 2002, I recieved \\"Songs In A Minor\\".  Being eleven at the time, the whole album went way over my head.  I remember enjoying \\"Girlfriend\\" and \\"Jane Doe\\", the faster and poppier songs of the bunch, but pretty much slept through the rest.  Anyway, when Alicia released \\"Diary\\", I was determined not to get sucked into the hype.  However, one day after seeing Alicia on some morning talk show, my mother asked why I hadn't asked for this album for Christmas.  I figured, \\"What the heck?\\", and told her I'd love to have it.  Anyway, I started listening to \\"Songs In A Minor\\" again in mid December.  Being thirteen now, I enjoyed it a little more.  But as I started listening to it more and more, I realized that it is actually a great album.  Two years ago, my collection was full of that Britney and N'Sync crap, but now it is full of people like Beyonce, Mya, and Mary J. Blige, Ginuwine, and Outkast so my tastes in music had changed greatly. I prepared myself for an excellent album...<BR>and was crushed.  I hated \\"The Diary of Alicia Keys\\".  However, unlike with Songs In A Minor I did not give up.  Two days ago, I popped this CD in my player and loved it.  The beats are terrific, the lyrics poetic, and Alicia's voice is better than ever.  I love Alicia Keys, but I just need some time to get used to her CDs.  The same thing will probably happen with her third effort.  Many males here have said that this album is to emotional for them and that only women will enjoy it.  Well guess what?  I'm a teenage guy and I love this CD.  My favorite songs are \\"Karma\\", \\"If I was your woman/Walk on By\\", \\"You don't know my name\\", and \\"If I ain't got you\\".  I enjoy the second half as well.  All in all, Ms. Keys is one of the most talented musicians of our generation.  Please do not pass up the oppurtunity to enjoy one of the most  mature, soulful discs ever!
B00005ATQD|5.0|I found this film to be one of the very greatest I have EVER seen. I sat there mezmerized throughout its length. The pacing is simply fantastic. It's slow enough to keep you on the edge of your seat (yes, im serious), yet not to the point where it annoys you. It has that usual Kubrick style, and is VERY arty. Full of many shocking and startling images (not macabre or gross, merely unexpected) including the nude Nicole Kidman standing with her back to the camera a few moments into the film, juxtaposed with the simplistic opening credits. Simply a PERFECT movie. Kubrick strived hard to acheive this perfection (explaining the record setting 18 month shoot), and he certainly was successful. Seeing the film made me only miss that wonderful director all the more. He was truly one of the greatest directors in history. The film was beautiful and mystifying at times as well, obviously dream-like, yet not a sugar-coated kind. It was as if everything was very familiar, yet so bizarre at the same time. This effect made the film quite unsettling, and all the more powerful. Hats of to exquisite score, perfect for the film, including Shostakovich, Grygory Leti, and Bob Dylan, also hats off to Nicole Kidman, who gave a fantastic and underrated performance as Alice. Nicole is not one of my favorite actresses, yet this performance I found WONDERFUL, and it makes me see her as a much better actress, I hope it wasnt the performance of her career, I hope she outdoes this tour-de-force. This film is ART. Every frame is like a painting, every motion is choreography, every line of dialogue is poetry. Everyone has made this film notorious because of its sexual nature (although it really is NOT all that sexual), which makes me sad, for people don't show enough appretiation for this fantastic swan song of Kubrick's. This film is wonderful, see it and be amazed. After all, how can you possibly go wrong with a film whose last word of dialogue is \\"f**k\\"

However, one day after seeing Alicia on some morning talk show, my mother asked why I hadn't asked for this album for Christmas.  I figured, \\"What the heck?\\", and told her I'd love to have it.  Anyway, I started listening to \\"Songs In A Minor\\" again in mid December.  Being thirteen now, I enjoyed it a little more.  But as I started listening to it more and more, I realized that it is actually a great album.  Two years ago, my collection was full of that Britney and N'Sync crap, but now it is full of people like Beyonce, Mya, and Mary J. Blige, Ginuwine, and Outkast so my tastes in music had changed greatly. I prepared myself for an excellent album...<BR>and was crushed.  I hated \\"The Diary of Alicia Keys\\".  However, unlike with Songs In A Minor I did not give up.  Two days ago, I popped this CD in my player and loved it.  The beats are terrific, the lyrics poetic, and Alicia's voice is better than ever.  I love Alicia Keys, but I just need some time to get used to her CDs.  The same thing will probably happen with her third effort.  Many males here have said that this album is to emotional for them and that only women will enjoy it.  Well guess what?  I'm a teenage guy and I love this CD.  My favorite songs are \\"Karma\\", \\"If I was your woman/Walk on By\\", \\"You don't know my name\\", and \\"If I ain't got you\\".  I enjoy the second half as well.  All in all, Ms. Keys is one of the most talented musicians of our generation.  Please do not pass up the oppurtunity to enjoy one of the most sexy, mature, soulful discs ever!
B00007BH5C|5.0|The soundtracks to all three movies are amazing, some of the most beautiful music i have ever heard and that's saying something. It doesn't matter what kind of music you're into, how old you are, where you come from or what language you speak it is impossible not to like this soundtrack, even just a little bit. I wouldn't have classed myself as a classical fan, not at all, but i love this.
B000002ADT|5.0|This is one of the best, if not the best, classic jazz album(s) of all time.  You're not a true jazz fan until you have purchased this particular album.  I've studied this album well during my college years, and several years later, I still find that no other jazz album measures up to this greatness.  Buy it and you will enjoy it.  And, that's a guarantee. (I also recommend 'The Gentle Side of John Coltrane' and 'Love Supreme' by Coltrane and 'Joshua Redman Quartet: Spirit of the Moment, Live at the Village Vanguard' in addition to this album.)
B0000CABBW|5.0|I am so glad I bought the DVD!  The behind the scenes commentary is interesting all by itself.  Keisha Castle-Hughes was chosen by the same person who chose Anna Paquin, and she does not disappoint.  <br />Whale Rider is, in part, about the struggle for acceptance and respect.  Here is Pai, a small 12 year old girl, always trying to please her Grandfather.  Yet she knows the story of her tribe.  Her mother was to give birth to the next chief in the family.  Instead, they got her.  This story transcends the Maori culture, for every child strives to be accepted by their parents.  Be it the first born, who has to live up to the parents expectations.  The middle child, overshadowed by an older sibling.  Or the youngest child, often overlooked for anything great.  Pai, though often rejected, stayed strong to her intuition that she could be great.  Her esteem, in the face of non-acceptance is what makes this film so worth seeing, for any young girl and boy, and adults as well.<br />Whale Rider also has a beautiful score.  Music of the ocean, of whales, haunting.  Peaceful as the New Zealand landscape.
B000005Z0G|5.0|This album is the first CD I ever bought of Tupac.  Then I later got 2pacalypse now.  I can't imagine how anybody can't like him or any of his music.  Same with Notorious B.I.G.  He is the best of all time and will always be the best.  Whoever says that any of the tupac cd's are bad just does not get rap music at all.  R.I.P. 2pac 71-96
0446677450|1.0|First off there is one decent piece of advice in this book, a bigger house is not a bigger investment, it's a bigger liability.<br />Aside from that...<BR>Kiyosaki's main point seem to be that of Gordon Gecko, &quot;Greed is good.&quot; The rich dad must have been the Mr. Potter of his hometown. He starts by telling the boys &quot;work for yourself, be your own boss&quot; good advice, right? However he goes on to recommend hiring people on the basis of who will fear losing their jobs most. Of a longtime employee he says, &quot;Mrs. Martin is like a mother to me.&quot; Then shows how he pays her just enough to keep her working in his store. Rich Dad brags about how he keeps his employees waiting for meetings outside his office, they'll wait as long as he wants because they fear losing their jobs. My favorite chapter is when Rich Dad tells the boys that society needs &quot;teachers, doctors, mechanics... [and] police officers, firemen and soldiers.&quot; However he makes it quite clear that neither of them should pursue any of those paths. Those jobs are for other people's kids.<br />The boys' first enterprise involves comic books. After promising the comics distributor they won't re-sell comics they get from him for free, they *rent* them, a-ha a loophole! Rich Dad also tells the kids that bill collectors are &quot;bullies.&quot; Don't pay your debts until you're darn good and ready.<br />Besides the questionable ethics related in this book, there is really only enough material here for a long article in Money magazine. The filler is long, meandering anecdotes and re-stating the same information, for example he uses the &quot;doctors and policemen&quot; paragraph at least twice as well as repeating the chestnut &quot;if you want a lession in confusion look up the words 'asset' and 'liability' in the dictionary&quot; over and...<br />The kicker is Kiyosaki claims his whole motive is to educate the poor and middle class. He fears a &quot;class struggle&quot; as the rich get more and the poor get less. His advice only serves to drive the divisions wider.
B00003CXAT|3.0|Having watched this again, many years after the original release, I am no longer as impressed with it as I once was.  The story is very lacking.  The characters are poorly developed.  I found that I cared more about the dinosaurs than the characters.  About the only thing this movie is good for these days is as a film-making history lesson, as this was the first time a movie had ever gone so far with CGI.  In its time, it pushed the boundaries with special effects, but as technology continues to advance a good story is necessary for it to stand the test of time, and that is where it falls short.
B0001BKAEY|5.0|The Matrix Revolutions is, like the Matrix Reloaded, a dense film. There is so much information and hidden subtext that to really understand it takes more than one viewing. It is a great ending to a great trilogy. If you love the Matrix films, this DVD is a must have!
B0000C9ZLD|5.0|Look, I saw Television live in the seventies (as well as the nineties and in 2001), caught Iggy Pop, the Buzzcocks, the Feelies, Eleventh Dream Day, the Mekons, the Replacements, the Pixies, the dB's, Pere Ubu, Yo La Tenga, and a host of other indie, alternative, and punk acts at their peak.  Although I didn't catch them live, I discovered Big Star a lot earlier than most, and the same with Richard Thompson (who I have seen often in the past twenty years).  I think my indie credibility is intact.  I am baffled by the negative reactions that these guys inexplicably generate.  I personally consider them to be the best band to come out of New York since Television (qualification:  on record; though they weren't a good studio band, the Feelies were as good live as anyone I have ever seen).  No, they aren't as good and are definitely not as brilliant as Tom Verlaine and Co., but they are still one of the most gripping new bands of the past few years in my opinion.<br />So why do so many people hate the Strokes?  I think the explanation is simple:  they were overhyped.  Or if not overhyped, hyped to a degree that many people found objectionable.  I only gave their first album a listen after being put off by the absurd overreaction to their debut.  Once I gave them a try, however, I was stunned and delighted at what a delightful and exciting band they were.<br />I liked this second album an awful lot even on first listen, but upon repeated listenings, I have come to like it as much as the first album.  It starts off great with some enormously catchy songs in &quot;What Ever Happened?&quot; and &quot;Reptilia,&quot; but then does something extraordinary:  it gets better!  &quot;12:51&quot; and &quot;You Talk Way Too Much&quot; are among the best songs they have ever done, and &quot;Under Control&quot; (with its Television-like guitar lines) and &quot;The End Has No End&quot; later on are just as good.  I love the tightness of the band, and the delightful guitar work that adorns each cut.  I have never seen the Strokes live, so I don't know who of the two guitarists is responsible for what, but there is some truly superb guitar work on this album, with the guitars often playing their own gorgeous melodies in contrast to the central vocals.  No, the guitar work isn't as breathtaking as when Tom Verlaine and Richard Lloyd would battle it out in Television, but it is still quite superb.<br />I think it is great to be discriminating.  And it is important to resist mere record company hype.  But it is also important to give a band its due, and this is a crackerjack band, with great songs and tight musicianship.  And now, after a great sophomore effort, I'm definitely looking forward to their third album.t adorns each cut.

B0000TB050|3.0|To be honest, I bought this one on the respected advice of a friend.  In the end, I was somewhat impressed, but really only given what I expected from this band.<br />In &quot;U2 Go Home&quot; we see U2 go home -- in Ireland, that is true.  And, in fact, the crowd does lead them to some excellent performances of &quot;Elevation&quot; and &quot;Beutiful Day&quot;.  These songs, in fact, give spine-tingling moments.  The energey of the crowd and the band feed off of this greatly.<br />The concert, from this point takes a reasonable turn.  The second movement of this show leads to a feeling of anti-war, anti-establishment, and, subsequently, anti-death.  The foursome of &quot;Sunday, Bloody, Sunday&quot;, &quot;Wake Up Dead Man&quot;, &quot;Stuck In a Moment ...&quot;, and &quot;Kite&quot; work well to establish a theme of futility and loss.<br />U2 build on this with the loose jams of &quot;Angel of Harlem&quot;, &quot;Desire&quot;, the inept &quot;Staring at the Sun&quot;, and the motif of &quot;All I Want Is You,&quot; but lose gas with &quot;Where The Streets Have No Name&quot;.<br />U2 tries to build in the fourth movement of their show with &quot;Pride&quot;, &quot;Bullett The Blue Sky&quot;, and &quot;With or Without You&quot;,<BR>but the momentum has been lost.  The emotion that the band began with has been lost, and so has ours.  By this point, most of us are just willing ourselves through the rest of this video.<br />By the time U2 hits &quot;One&quot; we are waiting for the end.  &quot;Walk On&quot; is mearly an excuse for us to make meaningless resolutions for our future lives as we leave this video.<br />In the end, this video shows us how powerful U2 can be, but also reminds us why we still like more resonant artists like Bob Dylan and George Harrison.
6303269869|5.0|I believe that addiction can only be overcome by love.  The demons of addiction thrive and perpetuate in a black vacuum of mental and emotional despair; only the steadfast love and support of others can exorcise them.<br />And indeed it is love that ultimately breaks through the shackles of alcoholism in director Luis Mandoki's gripping film, WHEN A MAN LOVES A WOMAN.  Michael and Alice Green (Andy Garcia and Meg Ryan) are a young couple deeply in love--so much so that Michael tends to downplay his wife's growing dependence on alcohol.  Only when Alice's addiction plunges her down a desperate, dysfunctional vortex--from rummaging through trash looking for vodka bottles to passing out in the shower--does Michael come to the jarring conclusion that he is on the verge of losing his wife to an insidious disease.  Alice is placed in rehab, and Michael's devotion is put to the test:  from his discomfort with support groups to Alice's subsequent aloof and detached demeanor.  Life after addiction will not be easy, for Alice, Michael, or their two daughters.<br />But again, love never is easy.<br />Garcia and Ryan give compelling, realistic performances.  I also was moved by the performance of young Tina Majorino, who plays Garcia's stepdaughter Jessica.  Over the course of the movie, father and stepdaughter form an emotional bond as they attempt to keep their fragile family together, and the strain on young Jessica shows.<br />I was shocked to learn comedic satirist Al Franken cowrote the screenply; what a departure from his usual material, but Franken obviously knows his subject matter here.  WHEN A MAN LOVES A WOMAN is anything but a &quot;feel good&quot; film, but there is little good to be gleaned from a story about addiction.  But this movie succeeds through its powerful depiction of devotion and love--a power that will keep the viewer riveted and engrossed from beginning to end.<br />--D. Mikels
B000002B2X|5.0|Close the curtains, light a candle or two and lie back, close your eyes and drift away to this amazing EP. Haunting, atmospheric the 4 main tracks are superb. The trademark AIC vocal harmonies are here for all to hear. Recorded after Layne started using drugs but before he became too lost in his battle. This showcases the softer introspective side of the band. A must for fans of the band and a good starting point for those who like meloow guitar based music.
B000089RVX|3.0|I think that she has a beautiful voice along the lines of Tara Maclean, Sarah Mclachlan etc but the musicians do not always do her justice. In some songs they over power her, which is really annoying. When she sings she makes you want to listen. I want to hear more of her, less of the dirge of loud music, such a waste of an angelic voice.
076780421X|4.0|This is one of the most charming &quot;chick-flicks&quot; because of the sweetness of Salma Hayek's character.  Matthew Perry brings the humor.  The music is very uplifting.  Many of the songs can also be found on a CD called &quot;Ultra-Lounge Volume 5&quot;.  The two characters start their relationship physically first, then try to fall in love later.  Along the way, they question what is meant to be.  They encounter each other's families and friends and explore their likes and dislikes and the result is comical and endearing.  What I am wondering is for those who are not happily married, does this movie encourage a physical relationship outside of marriage?  I have seen the movie but still am not sure.  On the surface, it seems like it doesn't.  But what would be the end result of watching this - would a person be more or less likely to start a relationship physically?  With the ending the way it was, it might make some younger viewers think true love might happen that way and end up leaving them with heartache.  I'd like to hear more reviews on this aspect.
B00005JMCN|3.0|I read Laura Hillenbrand's &quot;Seabiscuit&quot; and absolutely loved it, surprisingly enough.  I thought they would have a hard time making it into a movie, and I was right.  The magic of Seabiscuit loses something in the screen adaptation.  <br />The filmmakers tried to explain the setting that allowed millions of people to become fascinated by a horse.  To do this they use short black and white spots and narrate some historical lessons.  I felt this made the film quite choppy.  The audience could have been given some more credit; it is quite clear why America was rooting for Seabiscuit.  <br />The race scenes were excellent.  Thrilling and suspenseful, which is difficult to muster when you know how the story goes.  These parts of the movie make it worth it. <br />As for this movie being nominated for Best Picture, I don't see that.  &quot;In America&quot; and &quot;21 Grams&quot; are much better films.  But I digress.  If you have read the book, you might be a bit disappointed with the film.  If you have not, you will most likely find it enjoyable.
B0000CDLA7|5.0|Dream Theater has proved once again that they are the most technically gifted band in rock today. For all you assclowns that gave this record a bad review, you obviously don't know anything about music. You'll have to forgive Dream Theater for recording the same album over and over, which is what seems to dissapoint people. Well that is why they are professional musicians and assclowns are assclowns. This CD is pretty heavy sounding, Petrucci uses his 7th string a bit more for some heavy riffs, Portnoys drums are crushing as usual, the keyboard and lead guitar work are mindboggling. Apart from that, the songs and lyrics are well written and have feel and emotion. The album is more song oriented than some of their other albums but make no mistake, they still put their progresive touch on the album. I highly recommend this disc by Dream Theater.
B00005JMCT|2.0|Of course there are laughs in this third installment of the &quot;American Pie&quot; series, but we have seen them all before. Every joke here seems recycled from the previous two films. We should have known that this movie would not live up to the high expectations set by the original two, since half the actors from the originals decided to take a pass on &quot;Wedding&quot;. I can't blame them, because reading the script must have reminded them exactly of the first two. <br />I thought that after &quot;American Pie 2&quot; the producers would make a movie just for Stiffler, but watching &quot;Wedding&quot; made me realize how he cannot carry a movie all by himself. He is way over the top in this one, and becomes more annoying in the end than anything. He actually tries to redeem himself, and this is terrible for his character, because we loved him because he was not a good person, and did not want to be a good person. He can still swear with the best of them, but even the joy of the F-word is sucked out by the end of this movie. <br />If you feel like completely shutting off your brain for a little while, then this movie is not that bad, but it cannot be argued that this is the least funny of the three, and there is little of the surprising heart that made the other two decent films. <br />&quot;American Wedding&quot; is a perfect example of a studio flogging a dead horse, and hopefully we will not see an American Honeymoon or American Divorce.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I'd never heard of this series when it aired, but a friend introduced me to the DVD set that was just released.  I have more than a little crush on the captain, Mal, and feel as thought I've lost a band of quirky friends with different agendas but similar passions.  How could Fox be so ridiculous and canceling this series before it could gather a following?  Please, please, Joss Whedon, complete a movie so those of us begging for more about the fate of the Serenity crew can be satisfied!!
B0000VAFO0|3.0|The whole idea of this movie seemed to be create the perfect combination of &quot;The Matrix&quot; and &quot;Dracula&quot;. In some ways this works, as there are some really good action scenes here, as well as the expected dark and rain that comes along with a movie like this. The story is based on an ancient war between vampires and werewolves that has been going on for thousands of years beneath the eyes of humanity. All this is quite interesting, as is the history of the war, and the way the vampires are ruled in shifts. This film does not lack in cool ideas, that is for sure, but like so many movies with a great idea, it becomes quite hard to follow through on it. <br />For an action movie, &quot;Underworld&quot; can be quite dull at times, and although the direction is good, the continual darkness gets old, and ends up making the viewer sleepy. As expected, the movie ends with a perfect opening for a sequel, something that we have become really used to with action movies of late, because the producers are always looking for sequel opportunities and the extra money that comes along with that. <br />The acting is good here, and Kate Beckinsdale is beautiful, but it is not enough to make you forget that there is something missing in this movie: wall to wall action and a couple of hours of entertainment. I suppose if you looked at this film as more of a drama than action, then you would not be dissapointed from the slowness.
B00008OWZC|5.0|I won't blather on and on about every song on this collection, but only wanted to say that the version of 'Immigrant Song' that is featured on HTWWW is the finest piece of music ever performed live by Led Zep. Page takes a song that, in it's studio form, had no guitar solo at all and has given us an example of how a fine fretmaster can create an entirely new song at will. He blasts through about four different modes (scales) in three minutes : Aeolian, Phrygian, Mixolydian, Dorian and the Blues and Pentatonic scales too, just for good measure. Few guitarists can match Page for sheer emotional mania with a Les Paul!<BR>Bonham and Jones grind out a savage backbeat and bass crunch which form the perfect backdrop for Jimmy's stupendous solo creation. This is the ultimate Led Zep song and may be the finest live recording of any hard rock song ever.
B0001BKAEY|2.0|Put in simple terms, the last two movies of the Matrix trilogy were warmed-over, pseudo-religious psychobabble which did just about everything wrong to forever taint the first movie's fish-out-of-water element and dazzling effects. I walked out of the theatre with a terrible taste in my mouth caused by the saccharine, fake ending and over-blown effects. Did George Lucas have a hand in these two movies? The grotesque sentinel war at the gates of Zion was just sick: as the machines stood firing at the sentinels pouring in, the Matrix saga was effectively pummeling itself to death.<BR>The only redeemable scenes from these monstrosities was the car chase from \\"Reloaded\\" and the rain cinematography of the Smith-Neo fight in this one (the fight itself was rehashed). It seems sad that the last two movies did nothing to answer the millions of questions we had, but rather added more. But ultimately, we could not care less about the answers.<BR>ps. the cover art is HORRIBLE!! I guess they realized that not many people will buy this DVD anyways, so what's the point? What a sad end to a hugely promising sci-fi trilogy. Stick with Lord of the Rings.
B00005JME0|5.0|Before, i would never think that Ashton kutcher could be that good if he played in a serious movie, but now that i saw the butterly effect, i thought that he's a really good actor. This guys sometimes may act fullishly during his \\"PUNKD\\" shows, but he really knows how to act. I would really recommend everyone to go and see the movie, awsome and greatest thing i've ever seen. Waiting for the DVD to come out for me to buy it...
B0000062GK|5.0|The only reason Joe Satriani is on this earth is because the aliens kicked him away ........he was just too good for their little green hands! Then they dropped him on earth in a chrome ball and he landed somewhere in New York. Then after his 42 earth years he sparked the crystal. And named it Crystal Planet. This album, from north to south, east to west, night to day...call it anything, is just a piece of wizardy magic. I am not a guitar player at all and have never touched a musical note, but this album makes me wanna pick up a guitar and start surfing like the alien. Professional production, crystal clear sounds, flying solos....everything. More than everything. More than Music. More than your average Joe.  See the angels light the heavens and whisper a secret prayer. This is a great investment. Enjoy life while you can!  I give it the Milky way for stars.    Highlight of the album: Lights of Heaven
B00000K2W1|5.0|\\"Greatest Hits\\" is a compilation of some of best songs from Janis Joplin and Big Brother And Holding Company (led by Joplin before going solo).  Her combination of blues and rock remains ahead of its time and remains untouched.  It defines 60's rock music.  Her vocals are beyond amazing.  As listeners hear every word from her, they can hear the pain and turmoil she suffered throughout her final three years, 1967-1970.  Her written lyrics also express this brilliantly.  She sang deeper into her heart than any other artist.  Her outspokenness paved way for other female artists who came after her.  During her time, only two other female artists expressed such strength in the mainstream: Aretha Franklin and Grace Slick (\\"Jefferson Airplane\\").  Her fearless words and tactics earns her tremendous respect as a person and an artist.  Her track \\"Ball And Chain\\", recorded live, proves that she was equally amazing on stage.  Such quality in this compilation answers only one reason why she was named VH1's third most infuencial female artist.  Such influence is heard on many modern-day rock artists: Melissa Etheridge, Pink, Ani DiFranco, etc.  \\"Greatest Hits\\" is great for any Janis Joplin fan.  Every track featured is a well-earned classic.  The CD version offers two bonus tracks not featured in the original 1972 album released: \\"Maybe\\" and \\"Mercedes Benz\\".  Fans of this album and of Joplin should also watch her performance at \\"Woodstock '69\\" (offered on home video), which offers an extended journey through her life and her art.
B000002LJW|5.0|The music on this CD is of tramendous both musical and sound quality. Every time I listen to &quot;Journeyman&quot;, I want more of comparable quality, and that is hard to find!
B000000H66|5.0|Death's &quot;Symbolic&quot; is simply the culmination of everything Death metal has ever sought to achieve. I would recommend this album to anyone with a taste for ANY kind of Metal. Highly recommended.
B00005YW4H|5.0|I've read the bad reviews for this CD and I'm amazed. I was really surprised to find that anyone DIDN'T like Norah Jones. Well, it is their loss. Her music quality is NOT elevator music, believe me. I think this CD is better than any out there. It is my favorite CD... the melodies are so soothing, calming the stress at the end of the day. She didn't write most of her songs... Well, I want to know how many artists out there DO write their songs... I know that the majority of the artists sing songs writen by songwriters, not themselves. Not that Norah Jones isn't capable of writing music, because the two songs she did write on her CD are the best on the album. I just want to say to those people out there who haven't heard Jones to just give her a chance. I know you'll fall in love with her music just as I did. It's not the fast paced Jazz to do swing dancing to, get something else for that, but is perfect romantic Bluegrass Jazz... Great!!!
0316666343|4.0|I could not put this book down, it was beautifully written, and I was happy to see the writing quality stayed high throughout the book. However, I felt a bit lost at the end. I thought maybe Susie's remains would be found since there were some changes going on at the sinkhole. I just fell in love with Susie's character and greedily wanted something horribly cliche to happen at the end, like all of her family members finally join her. As a consolation, the family dog did, and I still will recommend this book.
B00005JME0|1.0|Dear Members of the RAZZIE AWARDS (the Anti-Oscars):<br />Please take into consideration the following candidates for your next Razzie awards ceremony, honoring the worst achievements in film, acting, writing & directing for 2004:<br />WORST PICTURE: THE BUTTERFLY EFFECT<br />A January turkey.<br />WORST ACTOR: Ashton Kutcher<br />Totally miscast, totally over his head. Yes, he's got the good looks of a movie star, but (at least for now) he can't be extricated from his goofy PUNK'D persona. People were laughing at his character's reactions during scenes whose content (like the amputee awakening, the harrasment during the awful prison scenes)were no laughing mattter. He swallowed his words, i couldn't understand what he was saying through most of the movie. Wooden performance. <br />WORST SUPPORTING ACTOR: Eric Stoltz<br />Eric, once a \\"promising\\" actor, has been reduced to play roles like JLO's boyfriend in a giant-snake-on-the-rampage flick & now (apparently chosen for his normal look, but also miscast) plays Amy Smart's pedophile videographer daddy, named \\"George Miller\\" (huh? Is this a tribute of some sort?).He looks sooo scary. I'm so afraid.<br />WORST SUPPORTING ACTRESS: Melora Walters<br />Obviously the filmmakers saw her wretched turn as the tormented daughter in MAGNOLIA & cast her here as a total wretch, Ashton's mother. This woman has a psycho husband in a ward, an amnesiac, knife wielding kid, fatally deteriorating health, pubescent serial killers for neighbors, etc. and the only thing she can do thru all this is MOPE. Reminds me of the Mink Stole character in John Water's DESPERATE LIVING but at least Mink started fighting back 10 min. into that movie & gave a performance that should've won an Oscar. I mean, i wanted Ashton's mother to stop the pretzel plot at some point & start screaming: \\"Am I in HELL?!!\\"<br />I'm very tempted to nominate the kid actors' who played the principal characters as children, but it's not their fault. The bad lines & coarselanguage they recite was put in their mouths by...<br />WORST SCREENPLAY: THE BUTTERFLY EFFECT<br />A premise of time travel that is so over-used in the space of 2 hours, it only induces vertigo or inertia on the movie viewer. Tortured animals, child porn, child strangulation, exploding babies, cinema lobby maulings, prison rape, prison sex, prison brawls, full frontal female nudity- but not cute Ashton's, sorry guys- campus dorm goth sex in a school campus where everybody looks perfect except the big fat spikey haired goth guy, pre teen serial killer, burning dogs, fatal head hammerings for aggresive asylum inmates, etc. Don't get me wrong, i am all for exploitation movies, but why include all of these elements & then treat them in such a morose, earnest manner?<br />WORST DIRECTORS: Guys, why didn't you just make FINAL DESTINATION III ? Do you really think you are the next David Fincher (saw the SE7EN poster proudly displayed in your movie)?<br />The only actor to emerge unscathed from this wreck is Amy Smart. She has to play several variatons of her role & she is honest in all, does whatever she can with what she was given. Unfortunately she even has to play a scarred, skanky druggie prostitute in one scene, but because she's so beautiful & has such a good body this is not convincing at all...
B000002MTR|1.0|First of all, i like all types of music.  Jazz to Rock, Blues to whichever category you wish to put the chili pepper's in.  When this cd came out, i was very dissapointed.  Just because neither john nor hillel were there doesnt mean they should release crap.  Dave Navarro's style doesn't belong in the Chili Peppers.  It belongs in Jane's Addiction and other terrible bands.  A monkey could have written 90% of the guitar parts on this cd.  I'm talking about electric guitar, not flea on his bass, because he still wrote cool parts.  This cd is semi-entertaining the first listen, but after that, it gets really boring.  I can only listen to dave and is best friend Mr. Wah Pedal for so long, then i fall asleep.  If you ever think about buying this cd, dont buy it, but instead buy any other chili pepper's album.  If you have all them, buy a Frank Zappa CD or invest it in learning to play guitar, and in a year, you can have more talent thean Dave Navarro on Guitar.
B00005MM01|5.0|I have been waiting for &quot;Gift From a Flower to a Garden&quot; to be available on CD as I don't have a record player anymore but still have the record (double album) from one of the most happiest times in my life and can barely wait to hear the CD. Just being able to listen here to a few songs fills me with joy&quot;<BR>Peace :)

B00001W9G0|4.0|I, like many thousands of others love this movie and could watch it over and over again. What should have been a 25th Aniversary spectacular is a very lack luster. My major complaint is with the 60 minute documentary.<BR>1.Great, we get to see some scenes that were cut that really SHOULD have been put in the film in the first place. How about the rest of the cut scenes? Legend has it that there is much more.<BR>2.Barbara's commentary is good but I really think she could have added a lot more. What about the screen play she supposedly was interested in that was, in essence, a part two of this movie entitled &quot;the way we are&quot;?<BR>3.Redford is absent on the disc because of &quot;scheduling&quot; problems? Or so I have heard....Gee, nobody could have waited even to get 3-4 minutes of commentary from him? Something isnt right.<br />I also dont think the transfer of this movie came out too well. Not exactly great quality for such an icon.
B0000C8AVI|5.0|The cd is great.<br />Wondering if anyone else has noticed the volume on some of the the Dylan SACD hybrid cds is mixed low.  I just went from a early 90s cd to Slow Train Coming SACD on my disc changer and I had to turn the volume from 35 to 55 to get the same volume.  Anyone else have this?

B000001FI7|5.0|I can't believe that I have not reviewed this album since I've owned it for years now.  Let's just say that Beth Gibbons' voice is so original and unsettling that it has to be heard to be believed.  So many bands are indebted to Portishead who (along with Massive Attack and Tricky) formed the &quot;trip-hop&quot; sound.  Groups like Goldfrapp (who are as good as Portishead in their own right), Lamb (good stuff, but not nearly as good as Portishead), Hooverphonic (alot of hits and a few misses), Morcheeba (pleasant, but have to catch them on a good day), Mono (hmmmm...tasty), Halou (neat little group), Alpha (lounge-0-matic), and Airlock (Portis meets Madonna).  <br />Upon its release, Dummy was considered by critics around the world to be one of the best albums of the year.  This music really stands the test of time.  I suspect that history will look back on Portishead in the way that we look back on Sarah Vaughan or Billie Holiday.  That's how good this is.<br />Don't forget to pick up the follow-up to Dummy (entitled &quot;Portishead&quot;) which is as good as this one; and track down Beth Gibbons solo album &quot;Out of Season.&quot;  All of these albums exemplify what is best in music.
B00004RFCM|5.0|Samantha. Carrie. Miranda. Charlette. Four names that television history will never forget. This show embraced the beauty of being single, living large, enjoying sex, and doing it all with a killer attitude to match that killer Prada mini-skirt.<br />Though some have argued that Sex and the City didn't really pick up until later on in the show, it is still sublimely brilliant, even in this first season. Every word of the show is poisonously funny and oddly very melodramatic. Carrie pours her heart, and the hearts of her friends, into her column titled \\"Sex and the City.\\" In it, she discusses the faulty and/or nonexistance of romance in modern society. The show is sort of sad in a way, reminding us all of the pain of being single. But it's such a joyous work of entertainment that there's no reason to waste your time shedding tears for it.<br />When you watch Ms. Bradshaw and her friends (the INFAMOUS Samantha as played exquisitely by Kim Catrall included), you will be positively mezmerised, praying that each episode could last a little bit longer. I would be shocked if you too aren't rapturously swept away in the complicated and delightful plotline.
B00006CXSS|5.0|My grandfather fought with the 1268 Combat Engineers in WWII and to this day enjoys keeping up with his &quot;Band Of Brothers&quot;.  The men portrayed in this Mini Series were truly heroes, even if they do not believe so in themselves.  True, hereos are the ones left on the field, as they say, but to me these men, and what they went through for my freedom make them heroes in my book.<br />From Disc One - which covers training to Disc 6 - which details the  actual men, this series is very, very engrossing!  I've been unable to stop and put these down since starting Disc 1.  I plan on rewatching this series starting next week and plan on showing it to my son as soon as he's old enough to understand what took place in these men's lives.<br />Very moving, and heart pounding, filled with awesome sound effects, so much so that it actually sounds like I'm there when played over my home theatre.<br />Very well done!

B000003GMQ|5.0|'Signify' is a record which heralds a new direction for Porcupine Tree, and sees them cohere as a band, crafting accessible yet subtely complex songs, although this album is nowhere near as straightforward (and, I suppose, as good) as something like 2002's wonderful 'In Absentia'.<br />Steven Wilson has an undeniable knack for churning out eerie, startlingly sombre melodies, which populate the bitesize, perfectly crafted nuggets of pop-psychedelia that make up about half of this album. A number of features of this record appeal to me immensely. Porcupine Tree found their own musical niche with this record, mixing unabashed psychedelia, flirting with Wilson's interest in 70's prog and the like, as well as plugging in the guitars for some overt thrash metal. What makes 'Signify' so strong is the fact that diverese influences coalesce to engender a record that is very focused yet treads ground that lesser bands would never even consider. Wilson's lyrics are also strong and idiosyncratic, dealing with horror and boredom in life around the late 1990s.<br />The songs themselves are uniformly strong. The title track , which opens the record after 'Bornlivedie' tantalises us with a minute or so of phone noise and effects (the way the phone goes off the hook then melds into the track is supremely cool) is heavy and dense, an instrumental that sounds like the band is aiming at a full on metal album. Its a fine cut, and when the band segue effortlessly into the lush, low key 'Sleep of no Dreaming' which has a perfect, melancholy chorus, things are taking shape nicely. I love 'Waiting', with its intensely singable chorus, while the second part of the song has some excellent bass playing and is supremely atmospheric. With songs like 'Intermediate Jesus' and the excellent 'Idiot Prayer' the band attacks more experimental, lengthy instumental ideas, sounding more like they did in their early days. Wilson gets to flex his pop muscles with gems like 'Sever' and 'Every home is wired', satirising late 20th century life and churning out gorgeous melodies in the process. The unidisputed highlight is, however, the epic finale 'Dark matter', a song which pulls the entire sound and ethos of the album together and places them into the most lucious, low-fi, moody closer imaginable.<br />As both a testament to the bands progression, and a fine record in its own right, 'Signify' is one of the finest albums by Porcupine Tree I have heard so far. Some of it takes repeated listens to kick in, but one of the great attractions of this album is that cuts like 'Waiting' are just instantly accesible and had me hooked into this dreamy world from the outset. As its a kind of 90's Pink Floyd, psychedelic progressive rock thrash metal album with a social conscience, its not going to appeal to everyone (was that ever an understatement) but if what you hear tickles your fancy, I guarantee you wont go wrong with 'Signify'.tirising late 20th century life and churning out gorgeous melodies in the process.

0060090383|4.0|&quot;Rachel's Holiday&quot; was the third of Keyes' books that I have read, the other two being &quot;Watermelon&quot; and &quot;Lucy Sullivan is Getting Married.&quot; I decided to read it after hearing Marian Keyes at a book reading. Although depression and addiction were threads in her other novels, this book presented the most profound picture of a woman with substance abuse. Keyes is masterful using of humor to deal with dark subjects (Rachel's first impression of The Cloisters). Her skilled use of flashbacks made me both empathetic and angry at Rachel's behavior. Although the ending was too Hollywood and less believable, I loved this book and would recommend it to anyone who enjoys women's stories.

B0000DJZAH|2.0|I have become an avid fan of SACD's in a short time. I have an SACD player with all the cords, the right receiver, and all the speakers. I have Pink Floyd, many of the Dylan remasters, the Police and even Elton John. The incredible clarity and experience of SACD's has me buying them just for the experience of the sound, it's that good. I recently purchased the Who - Tommy almost solely based on the fact it was an SACD. The sound is probably on par with Elton John's Yellow Brick Road, and right up there with the Pink Floyd. although it's more akin to the early Dylan efforts in some aspects, mono in stereo? For that alone it's cool.<BR>    <BR>      Yet, it's really hard to believe this album has gotten the amount of kudu's it has over the 30 plus years it's been in existence. I mean, yeah, Keith Mooon's drumming is pretty wild but listening to it on SACD seems to be about the only way to really enjoy this album at all. So much of it is awkward and lacking in confidence. Who's Next absolutely blows it out of the water within the Rock n' Roll pantheon. I sort of wish rock history would be able to discern great works from some of these pretentious albums that continue to be considered important. And this comes from a fan of the Kinks, including Arthur and Village Green. At least those seem to have some sort of pastoral themes that continues to be an important theme in western art. But a blind guy playing Pong? It doesn't really have any resonance...<BR>Having said that, the album is of incredible audio quality. I would gladly pay another $$ to get Who's Next on SACD. Hopefully, we will see quite a few new releases this year...
B00006V9A0|5.0|What can I say about this Great band that hasnt been said before this band is just totally Ground breaking and this C.D. truely shows it Kurt Cobain has a very raspy yet unique voice that drives us for more Nirvana will always live on <br />1.You Know Your Right 9/10 Good Song Very Good not the best on the album but it has a great beat and the beginning is very slow then it kicks off into an explosive riff and Kurt begins singing awesome song<br />2.About a Girl 8/10 Good Song Has a Upbeat and good tempo<br />3.Been a Son 6/10 This one for me isnt exactly that good but its listenable still good song<br />4.Sliver 9/10 this is a good song starts off slow then goes loud good song and one of their best<br />5.Smells Like Teen Spirit 10/10 Really Outstanding song this song is Nirvana all the way<br />6.Come As You Are 10/10 Another Great Track that is proof that Nirvana still kicks ass even 9 years later<br />7.Lithium 10/10 wow this just keeps getting better this song is very catchy and addictive<br />8.In Bloom 10/10 yet another catchy song and it is really fun to listen to the beginning is awesome<br />9.Heart Shaped Box 10/10 Very Good Song Very Good shows loud emotions and mixed feelings and how Kurt Shows it is amazing<br />10.Pennyroyal Tea 7/10 not bad not bad but not one of my favorites<br />11.Rape Me 8/10 good song with a good chorus<br />12.Dumb 10/10 wow this is another great song slow and great<br />13.

B00007KMP1|5.0|When I found out that Beck's latest album \\"Sea Change\\" had come out on SACD, I thought that it seemed like a somewhat unlikely  candidate for the SACD treatment. But considering my affection for Beck and the fact that I am a big fan of SACD, I went out and bought my 2nd version of Beck's latest effort, even though I really hadn't been that fond of this particular CD! I favored his earlier work, like Odelay and Midnite Vultures, but the idea of hearing Beck in SACD was too tempting.<br />After the first critical listen, when the bitterness of spending extra $$ for a duplicate CD began to fade, I began to notice how incredibly kickbutt it was. Wow! This by far my favorite SACD so far and I have most of the major ones, including Pink Floyd, Bob Dylan, Police, Bowie, Elton John and the Who's Tommy. Sea Change is by far the most immersive and takes the best advantage of multi-channel sound. It truly is a symphonic experience. The SACD completely opens up the album and creates a three dimensional pallette. It's the difference between experiencing it or simply hearing it. Every instrument is so clear and has a depth and range that is completely missing on the original cd. It's hard to explain, but well worth many repeated listens. While each of the other SACD's I mention above are of the greatest audio quality, Sea Change trumps them by creating an experience that seems to have been made for an SACD. Plus, Beck has always been an impeccabley produced artist. Until a better SACD experience surfaces, Beck's Sea Change reigns supreme.

She has done extensive research and shared in her text the conflicting views of various recorded information dealing with Henry and his wives.

B00004XONN|5.0|OK COMPUTER is often deemed Radiohead's masterpiece, and I agree.  However, it wasn't easy coming to that opinion--for I was struggling over which I feel is their masterpiece, either OKC or KID A; both albums are stupendous.<br />KID A marked a new turn in Radiohead's music, but it is not as radical a deviation for Radiohead as some believe.  When listening to KID A, it clearly has that 'Radiohead' feel to it (excluding the fact that it's still Thom Yorke's voice).  And despite some major electronica impulses, there is still a strong solid rock foundation underneath the album.<br />A brief rundown of all the songs:<br />&quot;Everything in its Right Place&quot; - unique and catchy, showing of Yorke's lyrical talent.  Neat looping of the voices in the background, and contains the typical far-out lyrics.<br />&quot;Kid A&quot; - the title track is one I skip often.  Interesting song, but one that just doesn't interest me<br />&quot;National Anthem&quot; - Heck yeah!  Awesome bass line and thrilling structure, with orchestra instruments playing in parts of the song.  <br />&quot;How to Disappear Complete&quot; - One of the very greatest songs I've ever heard.  It's so tragic and gripping, and it strikes you at the visceral level.  Best song on the album, hands down.<br />&quot;Treefingers&quot; - This song is often condemned by fans as mere 'filler.'  Yes, it's instrumental and has no lyrics.  But it's so atmospheric and ethereal in feeling, and it always puts me in a mystical trance when I listen to it.  Excellent, unique song.<br />&quot;Optimistic&quot; - At last, a more normal rock song closer in feel to Radiohead's traditional rock sound, but it still has that innovative feel.  Another unique and excellent song.<br />&quot;In Limbo&quot; - Very nifty guitar riff, with a spectacular phase-out ending.  <br />&quot;Idioteque&quot; - The song that stands apart from the rest in the album, for its blatant electronica.  Well-constructed, very cool, and catchy.<br />&quot;Morning Bell&quot; - The kind of song you would listen to when you wake up, to get you in the right morning mood.  Also has a good ending sequence.<br />&quot;Motion Picture Soundtrack&quot; - Fantastic song, another one that makes you feel as if it is taking you out of this world.  There is a long silent pause at about the two or three minute mark, and then six minutes into the song you hear this very peculiar, mystical sound.  It's the kind of sound you would expect to overheard if you were caught in a &quot;white-tunnel&quot; near death experience hallucination.<br />All in all, another landmark album from the Oxford boys.
B000060P79|1.0|I had to slap this kid at school who was talking about this band wearing his abercrombie t-shirt. He was saying how awesome this band was, he was saying it was the best punk band.

B000000OE7|3.0|I think it's true, that this is not their best work, but there are still some incredible special pieces on this album. I love Let Me Live; could listen to it all day. But the best thing about this album is the 22-minute hidden track at the end. It won't play on your usual CD player. Pop the CD into your computer and use Windows Media Player, and discover an incredible new age type instrumental piece that will blow you away. Yes, it's true it's not in Queen's usual style, but if you like new age stuff at all, this piece stands up there with the best of it. At the very end of the piece, you will hear Freddie's voice saying &quot;fabulous.&quot; And it is. This album is definitely worth a buy.
B0000024K1|5.0|As a life long listener and lover of hip hop music, I can say without hestitation that this the &quot;Neo&quot; of hip hop; otherwise known as THE ONE. Not only is Public Enemy 's second album the greatest hip hop album of all time,it's one of the best albums of the 80's, PERIOD! No album, with the exception of the Beastie Boys' &quot;Paul's Boutique&quot; album, has taken this many chances musically. The've thrown everything and anything in a pot, stirred it up and dumped it on the listener; from bits and pieces of other records, speeches from famous black leaders, sax squeals and guitar riffs(notably the main riff from Slayer's &quot;Seasons In The Abyss&quot;). They've even made songs from ERRORS!;listen closely to &quot;Don't Believe The Hype&quot; to see what I am talking about. Chuck D, the original &quot;Prophet Of Rage&quot;, along with Flavor Flav's crazy ass &quot;Cold Lampin&quot; along with Terminatior X &quot;To The Edge Of Panic&quot; and Professor Griff slam you over the head with track after track of greatness. This is a great hip hop record, a great hard rock record, a great punk rock record,a great RECORD. It's what hip hop used to sound like before it went insane. Go pick it up, turn it up and BRING THE NOISE!
B00007ELEL|5.0|I love this movie. Everything about it rules. It is hilarious. You have to see the DVD though because there is alot of cursing.<br />The best thing about it is John Goodman. He dominates every scene he's in. The Coen Brothers did a great job in making the dude calm, and making Walter infuriate him. Basically the dude has to find some money he failed at delivering, and a bunch of people want it. Walter(John Goodman) decides that it is time to take matters into his hands.<br />5 stars!
B0000024JN|5.0|I remember being a young lad of 10 years old; a neighborhood kid was bumping from his boombox one of the weirdest sounding rap records I had ever heard. I asked him who it was, and he said it was Paul Revere by the Beastie Boys. The Beastie who? Anybody with a off color sounding name like that had to be good, right? He lent me the tape and I played it relentlessly for two weeks;I still didn't know who they were or what they looked like. Eventually I found out their physical make up, and was in for the shock of my life; to paraphrase Wild Cherry,the boys who were playing that funky music were WHITE?! That's right; three white Jewish punk rockers were rapping; It's going to be Elvis all over again, I thought, as it related to whites co-opting black music. This would be the first and LAST time I would judge a book by it's cover. <br />They were in fact the white boys who preformed in the talent show in the movie Krush Groove(go rent it for some Hip Hop 101), and who went on the Rasing Hell tour with Run-DMC and LL Cool J and opened for Madonna on her Like A  Virgin Tour. I didn't know it at the time, but their debut album would consume my life(well, the rest of my 80's life). These guys were Eminem before he even knew what a microphone was; gay and women's activist groups be warned.But these guys a so utterly silly that anybody with half a brain wouldn't take them seriously. How may classics can yoy pack in to one album? \\"Hold It Now, Hit It\\",\\"She's Crafty\\", \\"Fight For Your Right To Party\\"(with the main riff supplied by Slayer's Kerry King),the aforementioned \\"Paul Revere\\", and my personal favorite \\"No Sleep Till Brooklyn\\". Though they would go on to mature personally and professionally and make better records, in particiular \\"Paul's Boutique\\" and \\"Check Your Head\\", they would never recapture the commerical sucess and amoration of their debut. Time To Get Ill!

B00005JM0B|4.0|Terminator 3 lacks the inventiveness of T1 and the style and panache of T2; however, T3 is ultimately a very gratifying entry in the series.  The movie opens as a sexy female Terminator (Terminatrix) arrives from the future and begins systematically eliminating people (much of it off-camera - the movie is not especially gory).  As with the shape-shifter from T2, the Terminatrix has some ingenious new features.  Nick Stahl replaces Edward Furlong as John Connor, now age 20.  He's been on the move since T2 and the subsequent death of his mother, never staying in one place or developing relationships.  He and Claire Danes become entangled and gradually we begin to understand her involvement.  Of course, Arnold arrives along the way - what would a Terminator movie be without him?<br />The plot is clever and filled with humor, much of it courtesy of Arnold's quips.  There are also some excellent stunts, particularly a chase scene involving a crane that seems to destroy much of LA.  T3 is much more straight-forward and brisk than T2.  In a strange way, the movie is a *comfortable* action film; we know what to expect from the series and it delivers.  The ending is also satisfying while also clearly leaving the door open for T4.  Overall, it's a solid action movie.

B0001BKAEY|4.0|Many will argue and debate that there shouldn't have even been a Matrix trilogy, I'm not going into that here, because if you're reading this, you're at least interested in the movies.<br />Revolutions picks up immediately after the ending of Reloaded, and does much to combat the pain many of us felt after seeing Reloaded. Basically, Neo is stuck in a sort of Netherworld, neither the \\"real world\\", nor the Matrix, and Trinity is tapped to get him out. Meanwhile, the Machines are coming to Zion, in massive force, while Zion prepares for the attack. During all of this Agent Smith is rapidly taking over everyone plugged into the Matrix, thus becoming even more powerful. The movie climaxes in a massive battle between the Machines and Zion, and between Neo and Smith.<br />And now, on to at least my opinion of it. No, it's not the original, but it succeeds where Reloaded failed (these two movies should have been 1 long movie anyways). There's far more character work in this film than in Reloaded. It's emotionally satisfying, even if the outcome isn't exactly the one you were expecting. The paceing is pretty rapid, there's very little that seems extraneous, and the CGI and action in the battle for Zion is simply jaw-dropping.  There's also a lot of closure in this film, for the characters, for the main story, and for us the viewing audience. It's a pretty damned good movie, even if you're not a Matrix fan, and I'd definitely recommend it to a friend.
B00005JMJ4|1.0|I don't get you people. Just because the movie is composed of arduously long shots with little dialogue- that don't make it compelling cinema. Just because the characters are 'alienated' don't make them interesting. Just because there's a happenin' soundtrack don't make it worthwhile. And just because Ms. Johansson looks nice in panties and can stub her toe believably- that don't make her talented. And just because the boom-mike falls into frame after frame, that don't make it arty, or relevant... And while I'm at it, Just because someone studied philosophy (which is a joke anyway) or dabbles in flower-arranging or is stuck in a dead-end marriage- that don't make her deep. <br />...There is no discernable script, or plot, or substance to this abortion. It's not that I hated it- there's nothing to hate. It's just a spoilt rich girl's painfully contrived delusions about herself and her place in the world.
B000001GQU|4.0|I've had this CD for about six years now, and must have listened to it hundreds of times.  I will say right from the start that it is my favorite recording of Verdi's Requiem, and my first.  Some may say that I haven't moved on or matured in taste, but I would rather think of it as not having heard another version that invokes such a broad range of texture.  The Dies Irae is thunderous and bold, and just listen to how Fricsay whips those violins into slurring their notes.  The Quid Sum Miser is plaintive and somber, like a walk through a park after a thunderstorm.  The Lacrymosa is a veritable death-march.  I love it.<br />The problem is with the little details.  The tenor and soprano don't quite come together on the Quid Sum Miser, and the vocalists in general don't tend to sparkle, or reach a deeply expressive tone.  On the other side, I do admire the simple and touching interpretation.  I have been to performances in Cincinnati (under Luis-Cobos) of this requiem, and one time in particular the soloists killed it with their overly expressive, overly morbid interpretations, particularly in the Lacrymosa.<br />So I don't know what to say really.  I love the recording but can't stand some of the shortcomings.  I highly recommend it as a must have to anyone who is a student or fan of Verdi or his Requiem.
0312263120|2.0|I found this on my plane seat and plowed through the first 50 pages. The writing style reminds me of the dreck I cranked out for my high school creative writing assignments minutes before it was due. The crypto is wrong. If the NSA's computer could break a code in 10 minutes, wouldn't extending the key by 8 bits cause it to take 42 hours? And it wouldn't work on triple DES. If you know nothing about crypto, then you can hold your nose and waste a few hours of your life reading this book.
B000021YQV|1.0|I have to say that this album is exemplary of the kind of new \\"nu-metal\\" fallout that another rung lower to hell from where Nirvana started us out in the early 90's.  And just as with Kirk Cokebrain and his tripe angst, \\"SOAD\\" and their unforgivably rotten lead singer now try to seem relevant and, even worse, intelligent with their rambling, incoherent, nonsensical pop-socio-babble.    I used to work in a car shop, and the guy in the bay next to me used to play SOAD all the time.  And do you know what happened when I heard it for the first time?  I laughed at it.  I was literally laughing because it was so bad it was funny.  I couldn't believe that this had made it past a producer, a recording studio, and studio executives to actually make it onto the market.  It's a horrible sign that this kind of garbage is available to buy as \\"music.\\"  For a while I was actually mystified as to how this could be, but after thinking about it, I think I know why.    The only reason something like this could make it onto the shelves would be because they felt there was a market for this.  With such a lack of musical and lyrical value, the only reason this would land in the stores would be because someone would have enough bad taste to buy it.  But guess what, there are people with enough bad taste, and they are kids, ages 13-19.      Listen up kids, the fact that the record companies push this stuff on you is because they don't respect you.  But guess what?  You don't deserve respect because you don't know good music when you hear it.  And I don't know if it's because no one has taken the time to educate you, or try and turn you onto good music, but you have obviously forfeited the right to good taste and respectibility.  Please, do yourself a favor, have some respect for yourselves.  Quit pandering to these millionaire execs who think so low of you as to drop crap like this on you and expect you to buy it.  Show them you are an individual who thinks for him/herself.  Go get some good music, start listening to Bach, Mozart, Rachmaninoff, Vivaldi, etc.  Go listen to Led Zeppelin, Rolling Stones, Cream, Clapton, Jeff Beck, Aerosmith, Janis Joplin, U2, Guns N' Roses, Bob Seger, Tom freaking Petty.  Go get some Metallica, Megadeth, Slayer, Iron Maiden, Ozzy Osbourne, COC, Sepultura, etc.  Or at least try to discover something different than what everyone else is buying and stop being a lemming.  Reclaim your freaking identity.    Update on Sept. 13: 5 out of 17 find the review helpful: aaaaaaand the Lemmings win!
B000088E6D|5.0|We all make mistakes.... Mine was not paying attention and buying this cd when it came out months ago! My girlfriends knew better and went to see him in Las Vegas on NewYears Eve and they dragged me along. I have never liked the old style swing or bigband music and I thought that this was what I was in for. And like I said, I was wrong! Bubl sounds better in person than most singers do on their records -- no lipsynching necessary for him - and the arrangements and songs are amazing. Anyhow, I witnessed a fabulous performance (ooooh, he oozes sexuality!)  - just think - Las Vegas - the beautiful Venetian Hotel - packed with happy - party lovin beautiful people and an entertainer that just took hold of the moment and blew the roof off the place! It was the greatest NewYears and this is my new best fav. cd in the whole world! hmmmm hmmmmm!
B0000B1OFL|5.0|this was the most amazing movie i have seen. i love it!
B0000DD7LB|5.0|Every song on this album is absolutely perfect. I could listen to it over and over again and NEVER get tired of it.  She has finally broken free and started to express herself more. I LOVE IT! It is definately an 11 on a scale of 1-10.  I can't wait for her concert.
6303402348|5.0|Tom Hanks plays the part of Forest Gump, a mentally impaired young man living in Alabama. The movie is the story of his life from childhood to adulthood and his search for Jenny, the love of his life. You will be taken to the Vietnam War, to running across the country, and even to shrimping. The story itself is moving and entertaining to say the least. <br />If you're familliar with Hanks' other numerous movies, then you will not be suprised that this contains such well done acting &amp; directing. It's no wonder this film won Best Picture and Hanks deserved the Best Actor award as well. <br />Highly recommended!
B00006JJ1O|1.0|ok..I will admit it I did like the song &quot;All the things shes said&quot; but the rest fo the cd isnt good at all...they sing about nothing! The only reason most people even like them is because there lesbians!
B000002U82|5.0|Pink floyds album Dark Side is Unbelevable.<br />Track 1. Speak To Me/Breathe: Cool effects then goes greatly into breathe, nice vocals. 9/10<br />2. On The Run- another great showoff of effects. Gets a little irritating after a while though. 8/10<br />3. Time- An amazing pink floyd song. Starts off with clocks ringing and then goes into a cool intro with w eird drum sounds. Busts into the verse and so on. Amazing song. 100/10<br />4. Great Gig In The Sky- Sounds great, the female vocal soloes are very impressive andthe drumming is great too. 10/10<br />5. Money- Another floyd masterpeice. 150/10<br />6. Us and Them- Chilling, yet great. 8/10<br />7. Any Colour you like- Always gets me in a good mood. Cool synthesizer sounds too. 10/10<br />8. Brain Damage- One word, incredible. From start to finish every sound is perfect. From the vocals, the drums, bass, guitar, or synthesizer its all good. One of my favorite floyd songs. At the end a climactic drum fill takes it right into Eclipse (Track 9). 10/10<br />9. Though its only about 2 minutes long, its an awesome song. The drumming is great and how it ends off with the sound of a hearbeat is astounding. I cant describe how good this song is.... 10000000000/10

B00012QM8G|5.0|I avoided seeing this film for years, feeling I just couldn't take the angst and pain of yet another Holocaust experience. I mean, Sophie's Choice nearly did me in. But I was wrong. While there's plenty of horror and violence in Schindler's List, the movie is really a character study of one man's transformation. Schindler, for reasons probably inexplicable even to himself, rose above his privileged, hedonistic, self-serving lifestyle to become a hero from within the system. <BR>Oskar Schindler risked his life and bankrupted himself but managed to save more than 1000 Jews from death in the Polish and German concentration camps. He employed them in his factory and convinced the German Army that their services were essential to the war effort - while at the same time making certain that no product that emerged from his factory would function properly.<BR>Schindler, a womanizer, hard drinker, and relentless party-goer prior to his epiphany, was able to use his social skills, his arts of deception, his diplomacy and glib tongue to make his vow to save Jewish lives become a reality.<BR>If you haven't seen this film for reasons of squeamishness, get over it. See it now.
B0000072KY|5.0|Everything in this album exceeded my expectations!From the creepier songs like &quot;scentless apprentice&quot; to softer ones like &quot;All apologies&quot; this record is guarateed to impact with all audiences, and make people think.<BR> &quot;Loud and quiet&quot;, are elements that are very hard to blend together,but In Utero accomplishes that and then some!!<BR> Without argument,this album changed the world.
B00003CXRM|5.0|Joel and Ethan, the inimitable and unstoppable Coen brothers, score yet again. It's an over-the-top funny - and touching - movie about three cons on the run in Mississippi in the 30s. George Clooney, playing  dapper Ulysses Everett McGill, is the thinker, the planner, the schemer, of the impossible trio. He's slick, quick-talking, and funny as hell.<BR>John Turturro and Tim Blake Nelson play the two side-kicks, dumbos who go along for the ride and add comic bits to the action as the runaways encounter every possible sort of human as obstacles in their path. There's a blind man, a one-eyed crook, sexy singing girls, a Blues guitarist, crooked politicians (is there any other kind?), and so forth.<BR>And the soundtrack is so incredibly good that you'll want to go right out and buy it - as I did - and I don't even like country. But this is foot-stompin' banjo-banging, twangy bluegrass stuff that's totally infectious.<BR>If you haven't yet seen it, SEE IT NOW.
B00009V7P8|5.0|Damien Rice has always been an old favourite of mine, when he first started out in Ireland I remember seeing him live and it blew me away that a young guy could reach such amazingly high key notes..... &quot;The blowers daughter&quot; was always my favourite song ever by him...until I heard &quot;I remember&quot; its the kind of song that as soon as you have heard it you want to go out and just tell everybody you know how much you love them!!! This album is just a sample of his amazing capabilities and it just goes to show that even after all this time, Ireland is secretly flooded with hidden talent that is slowly making its way into todays world of music!! If you enjoyed this album then I am also sure that you would love Paddy Casey, again another one of Irelands young and extremely talented solo singers.
0380778556|5.0|This is a wonderful novel.  Everything about it is brilliant. ... chose this book to read for a book report, only because I had heard Alfred Hitchcock made a movie out of it-which I have not seen yet.  I didn't really know what to expect, and I have to admit, I had major doubts about the book after reading the beginning chapters.  But after reading the entire novel, I I understand why they were there and now appreciate them greatly.<br /><br />One of the strongest points of the book are the characters.  Never have characters been so developed and real, or at least I think of them as real.  I completely felt for all the characters, especially Mrs. DeWinter (the second).  She responded to situations as I would of and since much of the book is her racing thoughts, she thought like me too.  I felt for all the character and could understand why a man would kill his wife.<br />The genious of this book also comes from the smart storytelling and intruiging plot.  Everybody looks at Mrs. DeWinter and compares her to Rebecca, haunting her every thought (or at least she thinks they are).  The story telling is just plain brilliant<br />The book is slow at first, but give it patience, you'll not regret it.
B0000CDLA7|5.0|Perhaps Dream Theater read my review of their last album? Dream Theater's 'Train of Thought' this time was to write songs. Simple, good old-fashioned songs. My hat off to you, James. Singing low again has done this band good. A full range vocalist is nice to hear from these guys. It's been too long. For now, I can listen to Dream Theater and be happy.
0452282152|5.0|For those who have just discovered Tracy Chevalier's &quot;Girl With A Pearl Earring (GWAPE)&quot;, let it be known that it isn't a movie tie-in but indeed the fine source book for the screen version currently shown on the cinema circuit. Modesty, restraint and austerity typifies the tone of this vividly imagined tale of Dutch painter Vermeer's portrait of a maiden now known forever as the &quot;girl with a pearl earring&quot;. Though its author has declared the novel to be a work of fiction, such is the resonance and quiet power radiating from the heart of this simple tale I can't see how readers (and moviegoers) are ever going to regard the novel as anything other than being based on a true story. This is only Chevalier's second novel and already she has made her mark on the literary scene with a wonderful little book that is simply for keeps.<br />Chevalier's precise, stripped down yet luminous prose conjures a mental picture of 17th Century Holland so vivid it stays like a painting in your mind's eye. Like the everyday material painter Vermeer works with in his studio, colours, shades and hues feature prominently in the language. Chevalier's characters are also never less than sharp or finely etched. Our heroine and subject, Gret, may be outwardly subservient as befits the times but she has fire in her belly. She is clearly no wimp underneath. Catharina, the master's wife, may be the story's most odious character but she is also its most pitiable. She's bad tempered, surly, untidy, clumsy and graceless. Her husband won't paint her or even allow her to enter his studio because she's so ungainly and incongruous with the beauty he's trying to capture on canvas. She's bitterly jealous and suspicious of the lowly maid her husband secretly paints because she knows she herself is only good to him as a breeder. Or Maria Thins, the conniving mother-in-law who doesn't miss a beat or betray a conscience when she pimps shamelessly to guarantee bread on the family's table. The devilish Cornelia - a changeling child if ever there was one - is another unforgettable character. The character of the master painter Vermeer, silent and a ghostly figure at the edge of a scene most of the time, is deliberately underwritten but nevertheless articulately defined by his gestures.<br />At the centre of the novel is Gret's unrequited love for her master which is expressed most touchingly in the suffering she endures for him. Most tellingly, she withholds physical intimacy with her butcher suitor, young Pieter, until AFTER she has allowed her master to see her without her scarf on. In her own mind, she has saved her &quot;virginity&quot; for the beloved master whom she knows she could never have, so when Gret finally permits her suitor whom she doesn't love to take rough liberties with her, the act becomes a powerful metaphor of sacrifice and exorcism of a hopeless love. GWAPE only stumbles when its author makes an unwise concession to popular taste with an ending that's smaltzy, sentimental and frankly disappointing. <br />This one false note aside, &quot;Girl With A Pearl Earring&quot; is a beautifully crafted novel, one that is destined to have a long shelf life and enchant readers for many generations to come. I enjoyed it tremendously. I'm sure you will too. Highly recommended.
B00005JME0|5.0|This movie is really strong. Being through alot in my life personally, this movie is one of those movies you take really seriously. It has its funny little area's in it but nothing too funny to mess up the mood. It shows life. Personally the way everything was described, I think the write & director went through some of the same stuff in their lives (all the things happening as a kid). I'm not gonna give anything away, but letting you know that if you have been through alot of tramatizing stuff in your childhood, be noted when you watch this that it very well could bring back some memories that you didn't want brought back. It did for me. I almost had to walk out of the movie because of it. But it was an AWESOME movie.<br />BTW: If you think its a horror movie, your wrong. Don't go thinking that its horror.
B00005UEAR|1.0|Is Six Degrees Of Inner Turbulence a new Ben Affleck and J-lo movie or something? This album sounds like a soundtrack to some cheesy movie. I used to love DT until they decided to put as many notes as possible into a song and completely ignore feeling and substance ala Learning To Live. This album has neither, it's just pure crap.
B00005JME0|5.0|This movie is very well done. The problem with many time travel movies is that they take too many things for granted. They presume that changes in the past have very small effect on the overall outcome of the present and future of the world. In Back To The Future, the consequences are superficial and easily repaired. This movie, The Butterfly Effect, does it right. The writers and director created a solid piece of entertainment that challenges the mind and thrills the soul. I love every minute of it. It asks the ultimate question and goes over the ground I have been longing to explore for a long, long time. What if you could change your past and make it better? What would your present knowledge and consciousness do to the world if you knew at age ten what the effects of the next choice you make would be? How would you try to change it? Who would be hurt or healed by those actions? I love this movie. If you are one who enjoys a great piece of film, check out this fantastic film.<br />Ashton Kutcher is a very strong actor. He proves to the world through this movie that he is much more talented than the brainless hunk he portrays on his television show. Here, he is powerful and convincing as a man who desperately wants everything to be alright. He wants to get the girl next door back into his life. He wants to save his little dog and live happily ever after. But what does he have to do to achieve this dream? How can he make life better for everyone around him?<br />I encourage everyone to see this film. Besides the occasional nudity and frequent smoking and drug use, it shows a stark, real world that one man is striving to make better and how he must choose to do that, and follows through with the consequences of those choices. Fast-paced and intelligent, The Butterfly Effect is a powerful film.
0440418569|5.0|The Amber Spyglass was an amazing fiction novel. This final installment is definitely the best of the three, Phillip Pullman has done it yet again. The suspense keep me reading on and on wanting to know more. This world (or should I say the worlds) Pullman has created is beyond imagination. I read all three books right after each other, so like others I wasn't pained by the wait. This was a riveting and absorbing novel which I recommend to all!
B0000DJZA5|5.0|I LOVE this new, stripped down version of Let it Be.  I got it for Christmas (hinted to my husband on my Amazon wish list) and I find it a pure JOY!  No longer strangled by Phil Spector's overwrought production, Let It Be...Naked shines with some raw and and some mellow performances that could have been recorded yesterday!  It's like having the Beatles in you living room.  I especially love the simpler piano and organ arrangement of &quot;Let It Be&quot; and the beautiful, simpler &quot;Across The Universe&quot;.  I also love Harrison's &quot;For You Blue&quot; and and the railroad chugging, driving rhythms of  &quot;Get Back&quot;, &quot;Two of Us&quot;, and &quot;One After 909&quot;. I'm very happy with this album.  As for &quot;Fly on the Wall,  it probably wasn't necessary, but it's there, and with the the passing of Harrison and Lennon, it's nice to have a bonus keepsake.   <BR>Beatles Forever!!!!!
B0000DD7LB|4.0|Hey all, i have to say that this album is the best yet from Britney Spears.  With strong ballads, techno, regge, and pop all in one.  This album surly knocks Christina's recent album &quot;Stripped&quot; to the curb and let's &quot;In The Zone&quot; on the road to success.  Love Britney then and now!!!
B00007E8V4|3.0|System Of A Down were in a pickle around the time this album came out. Their B-side collection, in its raw form, was being passed around the Net like hotcakes on a December morning. Rather than pull a Metallica, and cause trouble for downloaders, SOAD decided to remaster the B-sides and add backup singing, piano, or whatever else was needed to make them sound professional.<br />And that's what this is. A B-side collection. It seems as though most are half-baked political diatribes, and so the album has a political feel. However, it's just odds and ends. Don't expect another Toxicity. We'll have to wait for that...<br />&quot;Innervision,&quot; &quot;Thetawaves,&quot; &quot;Nuguns,&quot; &quot;Mr. Jack,&quot; &quot;IEAIAIO,&quot; and &quot;Roulette&quot; are still pretty good, but the filler keeps this disc out of my player most days.
B000050FEN|3.0|I know what you're thinking - how can I give 3 stars to a film that I called &quot;fantastically well-made&quot; and that has a wide array of DVD extras?  Because technical skill is not enough - the film must be worthwhile viewing and certainly must not let me down at the end.<br />The good points: Director Fincher and cinematographer Darius Khondji  deserve special mention for making the film dark, moody, and of exactly the right pitch for the material.  Although I couldn't tell on my system (I don't have surround sound), I'm told that the sound itself is worth the price of the DVD.  Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman are perfect, as is the &quot;guest star&quot; serial killer, whose name I won't reveal because it's a neat surprise (his name is not given in the opening credits so it's not for me to reveal his name, although other reviews do).  The idea is creative - a serial killer &quot;sermon&quot; on the deadly sins.  Many have commented on how disturbing the film is, which is true, but not any more so than some true story serial killers, and I would have no problem recommending the film to others (but take the R-rating very seriously!)<br />However....  At the end of the film, for all its technical skill, I was not left with the impression that the experience was worthwhile.  The more I thought about it, the less I liked the ending and the protrayal of the serial killer.  Some of the murders (e.g. greed and sloth) are grisly, but not really poetic justice.  Likewise, the ending is very irritating.  Not so much for its predictability, but for the fact that it cheats.  Count up the number of murders at the end, and you don't get seven.  I have other objections, but they would require revealing too much, so I won't post them here.<br />Seven is one of these moody pieces where the audience is jerked around but where it should all come together at the end.  Think about two films with some of the same stars, namely 12 Monkeys and The Usual Suspects: the endings of these films are consistent with the buildup and don't cheat the audience.  Seven does cheat, so it loses status in my star rating.<br />The DVD edition is quite a good package.  There are 4 audio commentaries, although most of them (and many of the other extras) are technical in nature.  One entire commentary is devoted to the sound alone!  My favourite extra - cut and/or alternate scenes - is interesting, especially the original opening sequence of the film and the subplot it generated.  There is also an alternate ending that was storyboarded, which contains an interesting difference from the one that was filmed.
B00005QZ7U|5.0|This was such a nice movie. It had music, romance and action. I think that all should watch it.
076790592X|5.0|What a truly wonderful, touching story!  Morrie's personality really shines through and you can see why so many people were looking to spend time with him.  He had a bright outlook on life and living life to its fullest.  He encourages you to enjoy everything and everyone around you and put the material things aside.  We can all learn a lesson from him.  So glad that Albom has shared Morrie's story with the world.
B000000T01|5.0|As a second-generation Who freak, I latched on to this incendiary group right around the year Keith Moon uncharacteristically faded away in his sleep. Soon after, I saw the original &quot;The Kids Are Alright&quot; in the theater and bought an early Embassy VHS tape. Now that the DVD version is out, I think that technical comparisons between 1978 and 2003 will pale against the real story: The Who was the greatest live band and one of the greatest rock groups ever.<br />The film begins and ends, in a way, with their trademark smash-up finale. The Who, once they began playing, were like a runaway locomotive: imagine Keith Moon as the pistons, John Entwistle as the deep coal fire, Roger Daltrey as the howling whistle, and Peter Townshend as the engineer pushing the knobs and pulling levers. The whole thing veers out of control, and yet, it never becomes a wreck until the last song (according to the era), when by force of smashed guitars and bludgeoned drum kits, the incredible sound is strangled and mashed to a pulp, leaving only feedback and smoke bombs. As Townshend says in one of the film's interviews, he's not himself onstage, and probably close to hurting someone who gets in his way (remember Abbie Hoffman at Woodstock?).<br />The funny thing is, The Who's shows are a conjurer's trick of sound and sight. These smash-up performances began as a corny gimmick that took on a life of their own: Townshend, in a 1964 London gig, accidentally rammed his guitar into the club's ceiling while trying to spin it theatrically in the air. He was told afterwards to use the same move again, and the rest is glorious history. The spontaneous combustion in The Who's music gets full airing in this film by an amateur director. It captures nearly all of the group's distinct periods: early club days, Mod incarnations, Monterey Pop festival, the &quot;Tommy&quot; and Woodstock era, and the mega-70s appearances. Interviews as a group, or as individuals, span nearly their whole career (while Moon was alive and kicking), and at the end of it all, you get the sense that, as unpolished and ragged as they come across to our modern eyes, The Who defined that overused musical term, honest. Ironically, there's a contradiction when Townshend - who comes across as an unwilling but committed leader - laments to an interviewer that the band is often chained by its history, and yet, no one is willing to break the bonds of ritual between The Who and its fans. In the two performances that director Stein staged in May 1978, the group crash through &quot;Baba O'Reilly&quot; and &quot;Won't Get Fooled Again,&quot; and it's clear even to Who freaks that Moon was in sad shape, physically, and gamely keeping up, musically. Townshend parodies himself with arm-swinging and acrobatic leaps; it's almost The Who by the numbers. But when the last note sounds, the ecstatic response from the audience is proof of how much people love The Who and how the music wound its way into so many churned-up teenage souls. There have been bands since who've trashed their sets and gone to the edge, but there's really only one Who.
B00005BJ2O|5.0|Moulin Rouge was a great film and I loved the songs. One of my favorite songs was \\"The Show Must Go on\\". But that wasn't on the soundtrack! But they managed to put Bono's song which lasted for around 10 seconds! I think that the soundtrack is great but they are missing key songs!Also, the fact that the elephant theme is there is also great! It's a great song and deserves another 5 stars. Also come what may and your song are great songs.The people listed as singers weren't actually singing the song in the movie! what is up with that?!
B0000DZEA1|2.0|I highly enjoyed the third Lord of the Rings film; but, unfortunately, I felt that many moments were ruined by this bomabstic and quite unremarkable score. I admire the use of the Middle-earth tongues in the choir, but the choral writing itself sounds just like any other mediocre movie soundtrack. This is not a groundbreaking score: the harmonies are conventional, the orchestration is anything but colorful (excessive use of brass and choir), there is no subtlety in the emotions or the appearance of themes. The vocalisations are unimpressive: Billy Boyd's &quot;singing&quot; is pop-enhanced, complete with a false-sounding vibrato and reverb; and Rene Fleming, whom I usually admire, comes off sounding like she's singing through a woolen blanket. The last track, &quot;Into the West,&quot; is a hacked-out piece that certainly did not belong in the film and does not match what little aesthetic value is found in the soundtrack. I will admit I enjoy listening to loud movie soundtracks such as this one as &quot;mood music&quot; once in a while, so maybe if that's what you're looking for, then this is the album for you. Unfortunately, it's nothing more than that, and I advise the serious listener not to expect too much from it.
B00004Z459|5.0|Hybrid Theory, Linkin Park's major label debut CD, surprised me after listening to the whole thing the first time through. I had heard &quot;One Step Closer&quot; on the radio quite a while ago, and I thought that these guys were merely Limp Bizkit rip-offs. Well after I heard this CD I immediately forgot who Limp Bizkit was (I can't stand LB now). What I like most about Linkin Park is that they can still blow people away with their amazing beats and lyrics without having to cuss up a storm. I find their lyrics to be deep and meaningful, things that I can relate to. I just love this band- I can't wait to see them live. I'd say that my favorite songs here are &quot;In the End,&quot; &quot;Papercut&quot; and most of all &quot;Points of Authority.&quot; Buy this CD if you haven't already!!!
B00005JMTN|5.0|I will have to admit that \\"Big Fish\\" wasn't high on my list of movies that I really wanted to see. I went to see the film with some friends this afternoon. Much to my surprise I loved the movie from the wonderful casting of Ewan McGregor, Jessica Lange, Alison Lohman, Albert Finney, Billy Crudup, and Helena Bonham Carter to the vibrant colors of the film. Billy Crudup plays Edward Bloom's (Albert Finney) estranged son Will who comes home because Edward is dying. Will wants to try to learn the truth about his father because his father had a reputation for telling tall stories. He wants to get to know his father on a personal level. Based on the Daniel Wallace novel (another book I need to read now that I have seen the film version), director Tim Burton weaves a tale that weaves back and forth from the present moment/reality to the past/fictional(?). Tim does a wonderful job of melding the past and present together. I never thought that Helena Bonham Carter was remotely attractive but I have to admit that she looked beautiful as Jenny, a friend from Edward's past. Alison Lohman looked convincingly as a young Sandra. She did look like Jessica Lange but younger. I loved Matthew McGory as the gentle giant Karl as well as the Chinese twins Ada and Arlene Tai as Ping and Jing. I didn't really think that Billy Crudup had much depth (maybe the depth of a dixie cup) as Will. I guess Tim could have cast someone much worse than Billy, like Billy Zane for example. Otherwise the rest of the ensemble cast in the movie put in outstanding performances. I also loved Steve Buscemi's character Norther Winslow and his transformation which I won't give away. I thoroughly enjoyed \\"Big Fish\\". There wasn't a single moment in the movie that I didn't enjoy. I didn't realize until the film first came out that Albert Finney played Daddy Warbucks in the film version of \\"Annie\\". I haven't seen Albert Finney in the movies in years. He looked quite different in \\"Big Fish\\". Just thought I would share that piece of information.e that piece of information.
B000002U6E|5.0|Ever had that feeling where you can't remember if you had written a review for a particular album or not? Well &quot;The Cross of Changes&quot; is one of those cds. I decided to throw this cd into my stereo today and it got me thinking whether or not I reviewed this particular album. If I did, I probably wrote it when I first started posting my reviews on Amazon three years ago.<br />Enigma is certainly one of my favorite ambient acts (I refuse to give them that horrible new age label, that label belongs to cheesy artists John Tesh and Yanni). Michael Cretu's compositions are very soothing and relaxing to listen to after a long day at the office with its tribal beats and gentle vocals often provided by Michael's wife Sandra. To be honest, the group's latest album &quot;Voyageur&quot; was somewhat of a disappointment to this long time fan. I definitely enjoy the group's earlier music, especially their last two albums. As much as I enjoy Enigma's debut album , I have to say that I like &quot;The Cross of Changes&quot; a lot more because it isn't so entrenched in Gregorian chants which often gets on my nerves IMO. What I like about &quot;The Cross of Changes&quot; is the blend of ambient and rock music which I think proves that Michael Cretu is open to diversifying his group's sound. What attracted me to Enigma's music to begin with was the timeless vocals of &quot;Return to Innocence&quot;. I still get shivers listening to Michael Cretu singing on that song. My personal favorite song on &quot;The Cross of Changes&quot; is the gorgeous &quot;The Dream of the Dolphin&quot;. The melodies are just incredible. I was incredibly moved by that song when I first listened to it. Too bad the song was only two minutes plus some long. There isn't one song on this cd that I did not like. I hope Michael Cretu comes back with an album that was less &quot;Voyaguer&quot; and more like early Enigma. &quot;The Cross of Changes&quot; is one of the reasons why I love the group's music so much.much.
B0000C7PSW|4.0|Want One is an album you're either going to love, or hate. A previous comparison to Opera was bang on, so it is redundant trying to describe it any further. <br />There are two kinds of people: those that pass by moments to get to more exciting and entertaining moments and those that take those moments and find all the beauty and humor in just that moment. The type of person that would sit and wait for the bus, thinking to him or herself about what will happen across the street in a few hours, or where that bouncer at the local club is really from. How the crack in the sidewalk got there. Life is an event in itself and anybody that can appreciate that, would appreciate this album.
B00005NOOH|4.0|I purchased this boxed set a little while ago and one night I decided to have little The World at War marathon. After viewing side 2 of disc 2 I put side one of disc 3 into my dvd player when something odd struck me, I had felt a little deja vu after viewing side 2 of disk 2. I checked the disk with the case and the episode titles were completely different, but I had seen them before, and I knew where, on side 2 of disk 1. Side 2 of disk 1 one had been duplicated onto side 2 of disc 2. The set was missing side 2 disc 2. I did not have my receipt so I could not return it. So if you happen to have this boxed set check to make sure you have all the episodes, and if you are thinking of purchasing this set do not throw out your receipt until you check to make sure you have the entire series. Aside from this problem this is one of the best documentary series ever made for television and holds up well today, and will hold up well for many years to come.
0743243307|3.0|It always makes me feel bad to critise a novel when, as in the case of 'Brick Lane' by Monica Ali, the author has placed her heart and soul into every word.  This colourful story of Bangladeshi-Engish cultural blending is certainly passionate.  However if it weren't for this passion the book would be a dud; it attempts to cover way too much ground (drugs, infidelity, inter-religious issues, inter-cultural issues, Bangladeshi folklore, etc).  By mid-way I wasn't sure the whether author knew where she was going with 'Brick Lane'.  Less would have been a lot more.<br />As for the story itself, it is about a young Bangladeshi woman and her husband (from an arranged marriage) who settle in an east London council flat.  Both of them have difficulties maintaining their Islamic values in this very foreign country, with their children seemingly suffering even more.  The author does a fine job in describing the heartache of these Bangladeshi families who are most often trapped in their own homes, afraid to leave.  However as the story progresses the author, as I explain above, losses focus.  And this reader gradually lost interest.  Yet thanks to Monica Ali I think I understand my east London neighbours a bit better.<br />Bottom line: Monica Ali's love of Bangladesh and London permeate 'Brick Lane'.  This alone makes it an impressive debut.
0060512806|4.0|Neal Stephenson is an amazing writer. His ability to keep this complex narrative going while jumping across five decades and generations of technology is truly breathtaking. Despite stilted dialog (including his penchant for having characters engage in conversations solely for the purpose of educating readers about things he thinks they probably don't know), we really care about the characters and their predicaments. Stephenson's command of language and his descriptive passages are a joy to experience. Even though there are a few issues like inaccurate references to The Lord of the Rings and mangled scientific facts (the speed of sound in air is not one kilometer per second), Stephenson reveals himself to be a polymath with impressive knowledge of history, literature, and technology. The only really weak part of the book is the ending, but readers who have thoroughly enjoyed the preceeding 1100 pages will probably not be overly disappointed.
B00009V7T2|2.0|The Mars Volta, the prog-punk band rising like a phoenix from the ashes of the hideously overrated At the Drive in.  And as usual, the critics go nuts and I scratch my head.  Not that I can't wrap my mind around this music, its just boring man, its boring.  Well, I'll take that back, Inertiatic ESP is actually quite a great song, punchy, dynamic, even catchy, well as long as the stupid jackass singing the lyrics keeps his voice unintelligible.  I mean &quot;mincemeat of pupils&quot; lets get real, thats garbage, so just scream little man, scream.  It's not that these guys aren't talented, they are, almost mind-blowingly.  But I don't care, the musical world is full of technicial talents who can't write a song for their life, and these guys might join them if they don't taper down the theatrics, or at least make them compelling.  This CD just sounds like a bunch of guys sitting in a room blowing their instruments out and jamming for hours, and leaving Rick Rubin to pick up the pieces.  I'm not a sentimental balding 45 yr old rock critic yearning for the days of the 3 chord pop song to return either.  I just don't.... get this.  And if this is a dreaded concept album like the title and album cover suggest, then god help us all, because the hardcore punk prog rockers have just created a monster, a hideous monster.
B000002NJS|5.0|Ever since I bought this album back in 1998, I can understand Madonna as an artist and respect her artistic and musical credibility.  From the mellow, density of the opening track, &quot;Drowned World&quot;, you feel the direction the album is headed and can understand why this woman writes and performs music.  The song is a poetic commentary on fame and how unrewarding it has been for her.<br />You then voyage into the realm of &quot;Swim&quot;, another slower song about the media and their negative effects on society.  Then comes the commericially successful title track that was a dance and a raido hit in the summer of 1998, complete with an award-winning video.  The track is an upbeat evaluation of how significant and insignificant our actions and lives are at the same time.<br />The albums tames itself slightly with &quot;Candy Perfume Girl&quot;, a rocky, guitar-heavy song with some firey imagery.  Next is the tribal and euphoric &quot;Skin&quot; that builds froma quiet moan to a full out orgasmic frenzy of sound, beat, and heat.  It asks a question and makes a demand at the same time.  Phenomenal.<br />Next up is &quot;Nothing Really Matters&quot;, another American single releases around Valentine's Day 1999.  The song is a slower dance song that comments about the lack of value of the materail world.  Next is the anthematic mantra &quot;Sky Fits Heaven&quot;, a song that has forever made me think about the importance of realizing that there is no day but today and there is no one looking out for me but me.  We are briskly swept into &quot;Shant/Ashanti&quot;, a sandskrit chant meets yoga workout hybrid.  The heartfelt &quot;Frozen&quot; follows which is a song about learning how to accept one's past and hope for a future.<br />The techno0savvy ballad &quot;The Power of Goodbye&quot; follows discusses the importance of relationships and how traumatic and inspiring they can be.  &quot;To Have Not To Hold&quot; follows along the smae lines, but with a tad more of longing for the one that got away thrown in there.<br />Onto &quot;Little Star&quot; a lullaby for her then baby daughter.  Rounding out the set is &quot;Mer-Girl&quot;, a creepy, part dream, part acid trip of a song addressing Madonna's mother's death and the impact of death and life.<br />All in all, aphenomenal album.  If any of you have read this entirely too long review and still think of Madonna as a cheeky twenty-something panting to &quot;Like a Virgin&quot; or wanting us to strike a pose, think again.  Reinvent yourself, and if you need a hint, I think there is something else you may need to about Madonna.
0689859368|5.0|I purchased this book on a trial and error for my eight year old son, and as I was, he was intrigued by the physical texture of these interesting books.  We have completed the second book and now look forward to moving onto book three.  The reading keeps all ages interested as to what will happen next.  A map included in each book provides an additional incentive for the reader to follow where the trio of children are heading to next in their adventures.  The book is an easy read but exciting, and not at all cumbersome to hold for nighttime reading.  I enjoyed sharing this experience with my son and we both look forward to other nights of ready the Spiderwick Chronicles.
0800132343|5.0|Das Boot remains likely the best war film ever made.<BR>I suggest purchasing the photo essay UBoat War as a companion, and also reading the novel Iron Coffins before watching the film.<BR>After doing so, you will agree the film is a truthful retelling of the facts.<br />I still enjoy the very first edition im deutsch mit subtitles, especially as the language isn't bastardised or 'toned down'(for whatever reason I do not know)<br />Especially the most recent edition, regardless of which way you watch, english alone, deutsch mit subtitles, oder just in german, each one is slightly different with regard to colloquialisms; the english only obviously being the most americanised??<br />Either way however, the experience through fabulous photography and sound effects transports you into the bowels of the mighty U-96, where you can only celebrate the triumphs of surviving, enjoy some Christmas cakes in Vigo, and curse the aircrafts at the end.<br />One to watch time and time again.<br />Also, you can see how Petersons experiences in making DasBoot impacted him in making the Perfect Storm.<br />Favourite characters:  Captain, and Martin (different speeches about der fuhrer in each edition also??), the Chief, and of course Johann.  However it is all the others that make the above such great characters, especially as we know they are real heroes of history and not made up Bruce Willisers.
B0000A1RJI|5.0|Klaus Badelt, a german born pupil of renowned film composer Hans Zimmer, has a grand old time in presenting the film music to &quot;Pirates of the Carribbean,&quot; a powerful European-esque score, filled with big, brassy choruses, instantly memorable themes and even some not-smaltzy romance thrown in.  Built largely around just a few themes, the score can be repetitive at times, but that pales in comparsion to the sheer fun of listening to Badelt's rendering of the films' many memorable scenes.  &quot;He's a Pirate&quot; leaves you wishing you were one too, while &quot;Skull and Crossbones&quot; and &quot;The Black Pearl&quot; jut proudly with infectious verve and unabashed bigness.  &quot;Moonlight Serenade&quot; and &quot;One Last Shot&quot; provide some quiet moments to the thunderous themes, but the score is at its best when it's at its loudest, and there is plenty of musical thunder to be had.  Despite its surprisingly short length (barely 44 minutes if that) the soundtrack captures the sense of fun and adventure to the epic film that bears the same name.  If you like your soundtracks loud and adrenalized, &quot;Pirates of the Carribbean&quot; is for you.
B000002BSV|5.0|Suede had gone through so much during the Dog Man Star sessions and everyone thought that it was over once Bernard left.  They decided to soldier on but how could they?  Their saviour came in the 17 year old guitar prodigy Richard Oakes.  Not only did Coming Up become Suede's best selling album but it also spawned 5 top 10 hits in the UK.  They had so much to prove with Coming Up.  They had to prove that they could still make good music w/o Bernard Butler and they did in a big way.  <br />     This is definitely my favorite Suede album and by far their easiest to listen to. There's so many great tunes to sing along and just dance to like; Trash, Lazy, Beautiful Ones, Filmstar and She.  By The Sea, Saturday Night, Picnic By The Motorway and Chemistry Between Us proved that they could still make excellent ballads with great lyrics to boot.  This album must have made Bernard cringe because he really thought that they couldn't pull this off without him.  After the tense and depressing feel of Dog Man Star they fully intended to go in a happier and simpler road with Coming Up and it shows.  Just 10 songs and it clocks in at just over 40 minutes.  They certainly cut the fat and their 1+1=2 approach to the making of the album works.  Maybe Dog Man Star is the critics favorite but most Suedeheads will go back to Coming Up when they want to pop just one of their albums in the car.  I should know.  A Classic.
B00000JCOV|5.0|i used to really not like Slipknot, but over the years they have grown on me alot. this band does have alot of problems, for instance, the lead singer Corey screams a bit too much, and needs to even it out with some actual singing. also, the guitar sound is a bit overly used and not very inventive. but still, their style is infectious, their lyrics are easy to relate to, and their overall sound is just plain hardcore.<br />i really can only recommend this if you think you can take it, so if you are not shure about getting this album, the sound samples should basically tell you if you should buy this album or not. the music stays very similar from start to finish. i myself really like this band and i hope to see them live some day.<BR>                         9/10
B000007QQQ|5.0|The feel of this music is as warm, mellow, and dense as an intoxicating haze. Bless The Weather displays all of the craft and integrity of Nick Drake's first two albums, but the arrangements are less ornate and more relaxed. Though the producers occasionally generate a few strange sounds that hover in the background, Martyn confines himself to guitar, piano, upright bass, and occasionally the muffled sound of bongo and steel drums, which are generally used to convey mood instead of rhythm. <br />As the seventies wore on and he descended into drug and alcohol abuse, Martyn's arrangements became more complex and less focused. But apart from Sugar Lump (a predictable blues number), every song on Bless The Weather is a jewel. It's nice to hear a folk jazz album that's genuinely beautiful without sounding gutless.
B00000263T|4.0|This album is strong. From the muscular voice of Udo, the twin guitar work of Wolfmann and Jorg Fisher (where is he nowadays, by the way?), the solid rhythm work of bassist Peter Baltes and drummer Stefan Kaufmann, this album is really energetic.
B00009UW0N|5.0|Halloween is the one that started it all. What would slasher movies be without Halloween? I'll tell you what a piece of crap! John Carpenter is a genius. Not very gory at all, but still scary as hell. The Halloween theme song is the scariest sound you will ever here, period!!!<br />Scariness - 9.8/10<br />Sound - 10/10<br />Acting - 9.9/10<br />Gore - 7.5/10<br />This is an awsome movie, you should definetly buy it, and if you like it as much as I do you should also buy the TV extended version. This movie is Rated-R for Horror Violence, Sexuality, and Drug Use.
B0000VCZKM|3.0|What brilliant MBA at Columbia Tristar decided that the best way to bring out a &quot;Special Anniversary Edition&quot; was to put it in home TV format? It's not the way it was filmed, it's not the way it was shown in the theatres, so why in heaven's name is this not on the DVD (or do a 2-sided flip disk, with full screen on one side and wide screen on the other)? Only people who seriously like the film are going to be purchasing a new edition of the disk -- Columbia Tristar is making a serious mistake -- any desk clerk at a video store would know this is a stupid decision. The film is a good one, some would say great, some say not, but if you like the film - full screen is an insult. The home video screen industry is very rapidly changing into high definition, wide screen format -- a lot of stores are not even stocking traditional screens anymore. Columbia Tristar -- what were you thinking????!!!
6305971099|3.0|Halloween 5, in a couple words, could've been better, a lot better. This movie has its scary parts but nothing like I and II. Not a lot of gore either.<br />Scariness - 8/10<BR>Sound - 7.5/10<BR>Acting - 8/10<BR>Gore - 7.8/10<br />If you are just looking for a slasher, get Jason or something, but if you really like Halloween $18 isn't too much to ask.
B00003CXZ4|5.0|Mememto is a remarkable film. There are details upon details hidden throughout; this is a tour de force of editing and storytelling. Above all, Mememto pushes the envelope as to what film making can be. <br />It's worth your time and effort. Watch and enjoy! Prepare to be amazed.
B00006JIZP|5.0|I think this is a great album, i like all of the songs on it, and have yet to find any thing by them that i don't like.  I think this album is awsome, i love how it's sorta slow, but in a good way- but fun also.  I definetly recommend it.
B00005Q4CS|5.0|Requiem is like a ride - it takes you and won't let go. The film is witty, dark and evocative. It shows the power of addiction and dependence. It is a film that purely emotes - raw and powerful, yet precise and graceful. <br />A must see!
B00008G8QV|1.0|I expected to have the entirety of each song dissected on these DVDs.  Not so.  You only get the easy parts that you can figure out for yourself.  For example, on &quot;Sad But True&quot; you only get the first few opening bars.  Holy moley I had that already, and I bet that everybody else does as well.<br />Don't waste your money.  If you have problems look up the tab on the net and just bang on the CD until you have it.
B00011V8CW|4.0|It's good to see the re-emergence of 'Black Tie White Noise' after having been unavailable for years.  The album itself seemed to get lost in the shuffle during the 90s, and after the radical 'Outside' and 'Earthling,' it was something of a distant memory.  <br />In truth, BTWN deserves to be re-discovered.  While it might not be a Bowie classic, anyone who enjoyed 'Young Americans' and 'Let's Dance' should check out this album.  It's all about rhythm here, and along with the two above mentioned albums, you can dance to it!  The production is very dense, with an emphasis on the groove and texture.  Highlights include &quot;Miracle Goodnight,&quot; the Tin Machine reject &quot;You've Been Around,&quot; and the terrific &quot;Nite Flights,&quot; originally penned by Scott Walker.  There's also David's excellent cover of Morrissey's &quot;I Know It's Gonna Happen Someday,&quot; which sounds like it could have been straight off of 'Young Americans.'  <br />The deluxe packaging also includes an excellent companion CD full of extra tracks and remixes, and a DVD of the 1993 documentary which was originally available on home video to support BTWN.  This contains a revealing interview with David, promo clips, and studio performance shots of several tracks from the album.  My only gripe about the DVD is the editing of the interview.  David can't even finish a sentence before it cuts to him speaking about something else.  This goes on back and forth throughout the entire interview.  It would have been a nice touch to add an extra menu option to watch the interview unedited, without the annoying cuts.<br />Overall, it's good to see this album back on the shelves with the extra goodies.  It still sounds great, and is recommended for anyone who might have missed it the first time.
B00007L4MJ|1.0|This addition to the chorus of reviews of this classic masterpiece is submitted as a comparison of the two digital versions distributed by Kino Video (Metropolis, Restored Authorized Edition) and Triad Productions (Metropolis, Enhanced).  Despite the more recent release of Triad's version, it is decidedly inferior.  There is no indication of any remastering.  The video images are dim and speckled with the flashes of white snowflakes characteristic of degraded acetate film.  Kino on the other hand removed all the snowflakes and provides crisp, vibrant images.  A clear example of the difference is an early scene where peacocks can be seen in foreground of the Kino version that are barely detectable with triad.  Moreover, Kino's version is more complete.  A specific example of this is a sequence of athletic games included with Kino's version that are absent from Triad's.  Finally, unlike Kino, Triad's musical score is incongruent with the plot and therefore distracts from the mood of the storyline.  It is unclear why Triad released such an unacceptable draft to compete with the Kino's enhanced product.  Understand, Kino's version is still not definitive.  The soundtrack is inferior to Giorgio Moroder's modern score and it lacks the tasteful color enhancements provided by the latter version.  Unfortunately, Moroder's version is only available on VHS and it is not as complete as Kino's.  It would be a dream come true if Moroder and Kino could collaborate to provide a definitive version.  Still the choice between the currently available DVDs is clear.  Kino Video's \\"Metropolis, Restored Authorized Edition\\" is far superior, while Triad Productions' \\"Metropolis, , Enhanced\\" is simply unacceptable.
B00005V3Z4|5.0|This is one of the best movies and one of my favorite movies ever. This movie really does make you think so GET IT!!
B000094HMU|5.0|It's difficult to me, to be objective with this film. So I resign. Simply, this Turandot's record is a document of the TOTAL SPECTACLE, as well as Wagner wanted that his operas were the Total Master Work , Puccini achieved it.<BR>The opera is beautiful, exciting and covers all the Puccini's forts: the drama, the lyricism of the Italian melody, the dense modern orquestacin, the tenderness, the cruelty, the visceral thing, the humor, the grotesque thing, the exotismo; and any sewing as a perfect suit, that alone we are sorry that it was remaining incomplete with \\" the death of the master \\", as Toscanini said, but whose Alfano's conclusion is sufficient.<BR>This version possesses the performances and magnificent voices of Marton and Domingo. It is a testimony to possess the version in alive of Domingo (in study with Karajan), whose Calaf's immaculate conception, his performance fills of details and performances promoted by Zeffirelli, and taken advantage by the direction of Kirk Browning's cameras, is unforgetable. Marton, in one of her several Turandot's recordings, is powerful as her princess's role indicates, chill seemingly, but betrayed by several reactions of flirtation, and feminine surprise (in the cruxes seduced by the Calaf-Domingo's courage and in the torture of the Act 3 for Liu's loyalty); her voice resounds in the stage and melts the people, the Metropolitan and this spectator in his house. Hitherto this record already is a marvel. But these performances are inside a fabulous scenery (Zeffirelli), allegoric choreographies of China very beautiful and integrated to the moments of masses (cruxes and overcoat the wonderful final), many details of creation as for the libretto (Calaf's loving look to Timur-Liu after his victory, for example, again Zefirelli and opportunists for the camera), the choir (another personage in this opera) and the orchestra of the Metropolitan they work fabulously (some goofs of the direct take in VHS seemingly have been corrected in the step to the DVD).<BR>Leona Mitchell's Liu does not make us forget the Scotto or Barbara Hendricks, she fulfills with her voice but she loses the concentration in any moments. Paul Plishka is a blind and aggrieved Timur for the pursuit, disconcerted by the attitude of his son, and subdued by Liu's death. Three masks are impeccably portrayed by Schexnayder (what will be of him?), Glassman and Laciura; justifying absolutely the incorporation of this curious comic trio in the action and also sometimes fearsome. Their unfolding with another dancers' trio that takes part in the ceremonies is interesting.<BR>Will it be necessary to say that the sound is fabulous and the image (putting to test in the night scenes) of impeccable invoice?<BR>This DVD is the whole experience. If you know someone who hates and does not understands the opera, give him this gift.
B000003Z4C|5.0|On 'Let Love In', Cave creates a pretty horrific 'anti-love' kind of mood - from the subtle cruelty of 'Nobody's Baby Now', to the demonic fury of 'Loverman', to the chilling pedophile in 'Do You Love Me (Part II)'. These are some really good songs that don't shy away from heavy themes, and in truth it is a relentlessly melancholic, violent album. The classic 'Do You Love Me' could be interpreted as the song of a brutal rapist, and the frantic 'Jangling Jack' is a pretty wrenching tale. <br />But that doesn't mean it's a bad album; rather, it's a d**n good one. It's hard-hitting, powerful and reveals all its charms and nuances after multiple listens. Cave comes through as a master songwriter and balladeer. This is top notch work.
B00005QY5Y|4.0|This is the opening line to Adams' best track on the &quot;Gold&quot; album.  &quot;La Cienega Just Smiled.&quot;  In the pantheon of classic Alt-Love songs, you'd have to put this one up there with Janes Addiction's, &quot;Jane Says,&quot; Coldplay's &quot;Yellow&quot;, and Radiohead's &quot;Fake Plastic Trees.&quot;  Similar to &quot;Fake Plastic Trees,&quot; the lyrics for &quot;La Cienega&quot; may seem insignificant or unmoving.  However, they make perfect sense in the context of this remarkably simple but moving track.  It's worth the purchase of the album by itself.<br />This is an excellent album, that is a relatively easy listen, even for those not necessarily familar with Adams' music.  &quot;Harder Now That It's Over&quot; is Adams'at his best.  Haunting, moody, and self-probing, this track is certainly one that can be depressing after listening to.  Interestingly enough, the album begins with 2 of his best upbeat, guitar laden tracks.  &quot;New York New York&quot; and &quot;Firecracker&quot; are prime tracks with carefully crafted chords and upbeat melodies.  All in all, I gave it 4 stars, a step just below &quot;The Bends&quot; and &quot;A Rush of Blood to the Head.&quot;  Another album to be used in Alternative Music 101.<br />Note:  Adams has made a fool of himself lately on a few public appearances, with sophomoric behavior and hideous wardrobe choices.  Don't hold it against the music.  &quot;Gold&quot; is an album that will stay in your mp3/CD player for months.  Other albums such as &quot;Heartbreaker&quot; and &quot;Rock n Roll&quot; are also worth your hard earned $$$, but aren't near the standard of &quot;Gold.&quot;
B000031EGV|4.0|This is one of the seemingly rare films that you can watch as a kid, and then watch as an adult, and don't hate it because, cos it seems &quot;childish&quot; now. It's like the Narnia stories by C.S. Lewis, I can read those as an adult, be transported to when I was a kid, and not understanding the religious undertones, to reading it as an adult, and understanding them.<br />I love Robin Williams films. He's one of the best older actors around at the moment, although one of my all-time fave films will be Miss Doubtfire. You get his full range of voices, and funny characteristics in that film. In Jumanji, he's more serious, but in the extras, he's back to his Miss Doubtfire funniness. There's one particularly line, while they're filming the earthquake sequence, and Robin Williams is hanging onto Bonnie Hunt for dear life. In the extras, you actually see he's standing on a plank of wood. Then you see this guy sawing away at something, and Robin goes &quot;That can't be good&quot;. It's just the way he comes out with these things!<br />Of all the special effects in this movie, the monkeys are the best - sorry, the lion isn't a patch on Aslan. They are so hilarious, whether they're in the kitchen (the monkey switching on the cooker, and nearly getting his a** burnt!), or on the motorbike (monkey with massive helmet on!)<br />The extras are kinda disappointing for a collectors edition. There are a few good documentaries, but they show a lot of the same clips over and over. Some of it is interesting, and you see some of the storyboards for the stampede, earthquake, and bats. Seeing storyboards are quite interesting, although the drawings of the animals does get kind of tedious flicking through them.<br />It's still strange seeing Kirsten Dunst so young, yet she's only 2 years older than me, and has done so much with her life. She must look back on this film and cringe - she does look a bit daft at times.<br />Interesting fact for all you Disney fans out there: Bradley Pierce (Peter) was the voice of Chip in Beauty &amp; The Beast! I didn't know that until I read his profile on the DVD.<br />So sit back, unplug the phone, and be transported to your childhood. Enjoy.rce (Peter) was the voice of Chip in Beauty &amp; The Beast! I didn't know that until I read his profile on the DVD.<br />So sit back, unplug the phone, and be transported to your childhood. Enjoy.
B000002NZO|4.0|Genesis' 1970 second album &quot;Trespass&quot; was a huge jump forward from &quot;From Genesis to Revelation&quot;.  The group went from being a collection of songwriters to a band.  The album's sound quality isn't great, and lead guitarist Anthony Phillips and (especially) drummer John Mayhew aren't in the same league with Steve Hackett and Phil Collins, who joined for the next album.  But you can hear all the pieces in place here for the band Genesis was to be over the next decade.  This isn't the first Peter Gabriel-era Genesis album you should buy, but if you like early Genesis, you'll definitely want to pick this up eventually.<br />The album's closer, and show-stopper, is &quot;The Knife&quot;, the hardest rocker on the album, which tells the story of a rebel leader willing to line his path to glory with the bodies of his supporters.  &quot;Some of you are going to die, martyrs of course for the freedom I shall provide.&quot;  When I bought the album circa 1980, the song made me think of Iran's Khomeini; today it may remind you of Osama.  In the early 80s, Genesis was performing revitalized live versions of their old songs.  They did a shortened version of &quot;The Knife&quot; on the &quot;Duke&quot; tour.  I'd dearly love to have heard their take on &quot;Visions of Angels&quot;, one of the most unsung pieces in the Genesis repetoire.  &quot;Stagnation&quot; is an example of the songwriting style that Hackett later called &quot;songs that started out at point 'A' and occasionally ended at around point 'Q'&quot;.  It goes through many changes, including a unique Tony Banks pitch-bending organ solo and a riff that you will recognize from live versions of &quot;I Know What I Like&quot;.  The album has more overdubs than most Genesis albums.<br />(1=poor  2=mediocre  3=pretty good  4=very good  5=phenomenal)
B00005JM0B|5.0|I really enjoyed the DVD. After hearing about our cyborg hero and his human buddy up against a female killing machine, it sounded a little funny at first, but its cool to see what new powers she'll be possessing. I highly enjoyed the movie. I also ordered a book &quot;he never called again&quot;, along with this DVD. I will be looking forward to reading the book along with another book that I ordered&quot;Life Of Pi.&quot;

0316666343|5.0|This is a great read.Alice Sebold tells a chilling story without histrionics or sensationalism, and her self-discipline makes the story all the more poignant. If you want a first-hand experience with what writing should be, treat yourself to The Lovely Bones. Another book that I highly recommend is &quot;HE NEVER CALLED AGAIN.&quot;
B00005JLT5|5.0|Wladyslaw Szpilman was having a happy enough life in Warsaw in 1939, making a living by playing the piano on the radio. Then the Nazi tanks rolled in and the next six years were very very desperate as the events of the holocaust unfolded. First, all kinds of laws came into effect restricting the movement and activities of Jews.  Jews must wear a Star of David, must walk in the gutter, are routinely brutalized. Then the Warsaw ghetto is constructed and Jews are walled off in a closed world of escalating brutality and starvation. Then they are told the majority of them will be deported, taken to places they are told are \\"labour camps\\" but which they are beginning to realize are something must uglier... Szpilman escapes this fate though he must watch his entire family taken away to their deaths. He is put in a work group, labouring in the city outside the ghetto. He then escapes out into the city where he is helped out by friends and resistance workers including Dorota, a young non-Jewish Pole he had courted before the ghetto was built, and her husband. From the window of the room he is hiding in he watches the 1943 uprising of the survivors of the ghetto. (Of course it fails and they are all killed.) Then abandoned by the man who was meant to be helping him he is relocated to another room elsewhere right opposite the Nazi police station. There he stays until the water supply is cut off and the building is bombed and burned out by the Germans. Now altogether alone, he hides out in the ruins of Warsaw and, as the Russians advance against the collapsing German army, he is helped to survive the closing stages of the occupation by German officer Wilm Hosenfeld. <br />That is the story of this movie and it's a true story taken from the memoir Szpilman wrote soon after the war. It also owes a good deal to the memory of its director as Polanski, a Polish Jew, himself survived the Holocaust as a child. It's a wilfully unflashy piece of cinema where everything is extremely understated. The performances are quietly excellent. Brody's in particular is superb but creeps up on one only very slowly. There is no score, no incidental music and music is only heard when it is being played for real as part of the action (except in one scene where it is very pointedly not being played.) It is as if Polanski wants to present these events as plainly and straightforwardly as possible and have us respond to them as directly as possible. For the most part this strategy pays off and the film is an extraordinary and moving experience. <br />The most extraordinary and unforgettable parts are also the parts that involve the greatest artistic risk on Polanski's part when Szpilman, after escaping the ghetto, is completely alone is a bare room with nothing to do except sit around and wait, hoping that maybe someone will bring him some more food before he starves, watching from his window events in the street at whose significance he can only make frightened guesses as months and months pass. The risk with theses scenes of course is that they could so easily have been just boring and the temptation Polanski resists splendidly is that of being driven by anxiety on that score to sex these scenes up in ways that would have killed off their effectiveness and their integrity: adding a bit of music, perhaps, or a voiceover or cutting into Szpilman's narrative with scenes from elsewhere telling, say, Dorota's story too. But no: here as elsewhere, Polanski sticks rigorously to relaying events as Szpilman experienced them and eschews any other perspective. And in fact these scenes are the triumphant reverse of boring as is the whole movie.<br />One thing troubled me. This film is always sold as a story of how Szpilman is saved by his love of music and it's hope-inducing dramatic centre is, I think, intended to be the scene amongst the ruins of Warsaw when Szpilman has just been discovered by Hosenfeld and, asked to play the piano to him, proceeds to do so. This scene isintended to be moving and it is but it's also surely a little disturbing. It's not entirely clear whether we are intended to think that this is the point where Szpilman is being saved by his love of music and if it is thereby implied that, if he had been a less accomplished pianist, or if he had been a fishmonger, say, or a dentist, Hosenfeld would not have bothered with him. I'm sure that's not the idea and yet there is a deeply troubling sense in this scene that we are unsure to what extent Szpilman is being tested out to ascertain if he is, in some sense, worth saving... <br />In any case, this is an extraordinary film, certainly Polanski's best movie since \\"Chinatown\\" and a spectacular return to form after the altogether unremarkable \\"Ninth Gate\\".
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I can't think of a single other show that -- out of the gate -- had writing and characters as good as that on Firefly.  FOX should have given it a chance.  Of course, airing the episodes in the intended order and having it air on a different night would also have helped...<br />The DVD set is wonderful!!  I've watched it again and again...and again... and I I'm picking up a little bit of Mandarin in the process.  The only thing I really hate is not having more!
B00005JME0|5.0|I just recently saw this movie and it made my top ten somewhere around 3. I am one for psychological type movies. This is one of the best ones I have seen in a long time. 5 STARS!
B00003CXXM|4.0|I did not see this movie when it first came out as I am getting tired of the summer extravaganzas that try to outdo one another with how many more explosions they can generate than what is playing in the next theatre. Notwithstanding,  I decided to give it a shot as I loved the energy and pacing of director Doug Liman's \\"Go,\\" and also liked the comedic edge and freshness that he brought to his debut (\\"Swingers\\"). I was still somewhat apprehensive as taut and original action thrillers are very hard to come by as most current movies couple the violence with buddy comedy elements that take away from a genre that has only been successfully executed by Steven Spielberg in his wildly entertaining \\"Minority Report\\". But I digress.<br />Since I hate it when reviewers give too much away, I will only say that Matt Damon stars as Jason Bourne (or is he?), a barely alive amnesiac with a pair of bullet wounds in his back, pulled from the Mediterranean by Italian fishermen. The scene itself is very exciting and draws you into it's web. Bourne's only clue to his own identity is a bank account number etched on a capsule implanted in his body. What follows gets very complicated and keeps you on the edge of your seat as other summer extravaganzas seem to fail to. Like its summer \\"cousins\\", the movie has action scenes, guns, explosions, an awesome car chase (that relies more on execution than on how many cars can explode), a potential love interest, and many of the usual suspects, BUT it entertains and I did not feel like checking my watch every 5 minutes. Is it Oscar material? Heck no, but within its own genre its one of the year's best.<br />Matt Damon, who I never quite appreciate, would seem to be miscast to play this type of character, but he is actually quite perfect is he tones it down and makes Jason Bourne almost seem like an everyman who slowly discovers that he has skills he never knew he had. The casting department should be proud of itself as it cast Franka Potente (from \\"Run Lola Run\\") as the main female protagonist. The actress is not your cookie cutter beauty nor has the marquee appeal that I am sure the producers would have liked to have a \\"name\\" for the role; but someone realized that her acting chops and international background would give the movie some grounding as her character is supposed to be a European gypsy woman who I could not see being played by say Julia Roberts.<br />The director does a great job in both action and character driven scenes and manages to bring excitement to a gray winter European exteriors and drab interior settings. With the exception of the first fight sequence (which is makes Damon look like he has superhero powers) and later what would seem to be a physically impossible shoot out, everything feels real and the violence is not stylized. The story is incredibly well paced and even the smaller roles are well cast. The only exception is Julia Stiles, who I hope was only a victim of some scenes winding up on the cutting room floor, as she's a talented actress who brings not a thing to this movie.<br />In a nutshell, this movie is about international intrigue and one man's refusal to be a pawn in some sinister, global chess game. Many things feel improbable but never less than engrossing. Also, the basic premise is not played for laughs (which I enjoyed as I am sick of tongue in cheek homages that use humor as a cop out) and the plot (once fully exposed)  for once does not involve a \\"brilliant\\" psychopath with either a desire to take over the world or get even for ______ (fill in the blank with your favorite clich&eacute;). This movie solidly earns its 4 stars as a nice version of what I'd like to see in summer extravaganzas.\\"Run Lola Run\\") as the main female protagonist.

0385504209|5.0|This is one book that will amaze you in every chapter and keep those pages turning. Dan Brown's immense imagination burrows its way starting from a murder in Louvre Museum back through the 2,000 years of European history.<br />Did Jesus have any descendants? Who was really Mary Magdalene?<br />Did the most spectacular brains of Western Civilization all belong to a secret society? What could be their purpose? And how are all these fascinating questions related to the murder case with which the book begins so &quot;innocently&quot;?<br />Dan Brown will lead you through the labyrinths of possibilities and juicy conjectures that you've never dreamt of before.<br />Great non-stop entertainment. Highly recommended.
B00000JKH2|5.0|At the Drive-In will always be a legend, no matter what.  They're just so awesome musically, but I think it might be good that they broke off, otherwise the Mars Volta and Sparta would have never been produced, but I'll talk about that later.  This cd is so cool, it just makes you totally want to go write some kind of music to call your own.  This was always one of the most inspirational cd's to me, as I grew into the bass player I am today.  Get this cd if you love music; Great music.
0385504209|5.0|The book is great, it's the most entertaining thriller I've read in a decade or more.  The characters were likeable and while the action was sometimes implausible, it was nonetheless entertaining.  It was like an adult Harry Potter novel in the sense of sheer fun.<br />You do not have to agree with the conjectures the characters make about the Bible and Jesus in order to enjoy this book. The book is like a guided tour through a whole interesting area of historical and theological thought, whether you agree with the ideas or not, they are at least interesting to be exposed to.<br />I have to disagree with those who say this book reads like a movie treatment. The novel is mostly dialogue, in fact you could say it is a 450 page conversation. That would not make for a very successful movie at all.<br />If the author had intended to make it just to sell a movie he would have made it mostly action, that is what sells tickets.  This is a \\"pure\\" novel, in the sense that it is best experienced in the novel form, as it is mostly dialogue, ideas, puzzles and historical exposition. It would be pretty bad as a movie, but it is entertaining and interesting as a book.
B00009V7T2|5.0|What is there to be said about Mars Volta that hasn't been said already? They are incredible musicians.  That's basically all there is to it.  The cd is flawless, perfect, 100% amazing.  From Jimmy Paige-esque wandering guitar solos, to upbeat almost ATDI sounding songs, this cd has it all. This has got to be one of the musically best cds within the last 10 years.  After listening to this, everything else tends to sound dismal and weak at times.  Give the cd a listen.  However, it's not made for everyone.  Also, to get the full effect of this cd, take an hour out of your day, and give it a straight-through listen.  Intelligent cd, incredibly well produced.
B0000UHFC6|5.0|Every other Amazon.com review has already said all there is to be said about the music on this CD. Just as with the movies, multiple listenings are required to enjoy the full flavor and mastery of Howard Shore. Fav track is Annie Lennox's song, &quot;Into the West,&quot; which is diminished when playing over the closing credits of the film in theatres by other people walking in front of you, the sound of feet on the theatre floor and general disruption. Getting the chance to hear it on the CD, undisturbed, is a real treat and, as many have said, brings tears as your heart takes wing. New Line Cinema and LOTR creators have been extremely generous with their phenomenal special behind-the-scenes features on the movies and music, and that continues with this edition's special DVD -- made especially insightful due to the videographer's being Shore's wife. Listening to the CD is even more meaningful once you have the visual of Shore sitting at his writing table, pencil in hand, staring off into space. You can see the music taking shape behind his eyes. It's eerie. So watch the DVD and then listen to the CD again, and imagine this master at work. And here's my vote for a CD set that contains *all* of the music and the &quot;rarities,&quot; as Peter Jackson calls them. I'll buy it!! Any middling to serious LOTR fan will thoroughly enjoy having bought this version of the ROTK soundtrack.
B0001BKAEE|5.0|This movie was complained about by people and critics who \\"use all of the muscles except the one that matter's\\". It explained every question that needed to be answered and did a hell of a job doing it. The war in zion was by far the most amazing sci-fi war scene ive ever seen, and for those who pay close attention and can figure things out, you will love this movie.
B00005OWEG|4.0|Director Francis Ford Coppola shot some two hundred hours of film to create APOCALYPSE NOW, and even though the 1979 version clocked in at just short of three hours at 153 minutes Coppola complained that it did not fully present the film as he himself saw it.  APOCALYPSE NOW REDUX adds 49 minutes of previously cut footage, giving the film a final running time of just over three and a half hours at 202 minutes.  According to DVD notes, the additions involve fourteen never-before-seen scenes.<br /><br />But does this make for a better movie than the original cut?  Loosely based on the famous Joseph Conrad novella &#34;The Heart of Darkness,&#34; APOCALYPSE NOW was both widely praised and widely condemned in 1979.  Transposing the Conrad tale from Colonial Africa to the height of the American war in Vietnam, it offered the story of a Special Ops captain (Martin Sheen) who is sent upriver into Cambodia to assassinate a general (Marlon Brando) who has gone insane and created a savage personal fiefdom in the midst of the jungle.<br /><br />The additional footage does not undercut the original film's highly praised assets, but neither do they actually resolve any of the original film's flaws.  All the sequences are interesting (and the scenes with the French Colonials most particularly so) but they do not change the tone or clarify the intent of the film.  This is a particular disappointment re a scene with Marlon Brando near the end of the film: although it does give you a better idea of the character's motivations, it does not cast Brando's performance (which is extremely weak) in a better light nor does it resolve what many have called an extremely awkward and very anticlimactic conclusion.<br /><br />It comes down to this, really.  If you are a great fan of APOCALYPSE NOW, you will certainly want to add REDUX to your collection.  If you like the film, you may be interested, but you're likely to watch the film--but you're also likely to find it overlong.  And if you never liked it to begin with, this re-cut won't change your opinion.  A further word of caution: with the exception of a trailer, there are no extras of any kind, and you may want to hold out for a possible future multi-disk release.<br /><br />GFT, Amazon Reviewers re-cut won't change your opinion.  A further word of caution: with the exception of a trailer, there are no extras of any kind, and you may want to hold out for a possible future multi-disk release.  GFT, Amazon Reviewer
B00006CXSS|5.0|I don't like war films as a rule, but the reason I enjoyed this so much was the way you get to know the various people in Easy Company.  The attention to detail in the series is amazing, and I liked the fact that some of it was filmed on location.  <br />My one complaint is that it is just a little overpriced.  Well, a lot overpriced.  If you compare the cost of this to other series, it is much more expensive.  For instance, for just about $20 more, you can own the first four seasons of BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER.  For less than double the cost the first five seasons of SEX IN THE CITY.  I'm not quite sure how they decide on how much to charge for each set that is produced, but with the full seasons of most television shows running around $35 from Amazon, the price tag on this one seems excessive.
B00009TB5G|5.0|Well, what can I say? Undoubtfully, the best DVD of 2003. This DVD offers you whatever you need to know about The Two Towers. In spite of some rediculous added scenes, the extended version of the film is what a LOTR fan should have. Some scenes were better not to be added in the film but it doesn't mean that you souldn't add this version in your collection. This DVD is full of wonderful and unforgettable behind the scenes and features which will entertain you for hours.

0743424425|2.0|I've 1/2-read many King books. Always got too boring to finish. The 2 I did finish were The Shining, and Insomnia. I don't believe in part-skipping, but I find myself skipping through books that I think suck, but I want to finish, maybe just so I can say &quot;I read that book, it sucked&quot;. <br />I can tell you I skipped a few parts of this book, partly because it was boring and irrelevant, and partly because I kept wanting to get to a part that was scary.<br />I think this book starts out with a good idea. Haunted hotel that makes a guy go crazy. <br />I liked how King developed Jack's character, however all that development meant diddly-squat at the end and that pissed me off. <br />I thought the hedge animals were cool, until they almost killed someone. Its one thing for them to come to life and freak you out, but for them to actually kill you? Please. <br />The ghosts they see around the hotel are stupid too. It seems like right when it was about to (supposed to) get scary, it got stupid. <br />This could have been a great story, and I admit it did start out quite good, but somehow it got lost along the way. (The same thing happened in Insomnia, by the way. Since I haven't read any other Kings, I dont know if this is what he commonly does in his books - starts with a good idea and totally ruins it, gets lazy, does someting or another to make it suck)<br />The ending did suck, but considering what had been done to the story up to that point, there was no other way for to end it really. The story became stupid, so the ending had to be stupid, makes sense. <br />If you are scared VERY easily and you like WAY too much character development that suddenly means nothing (making you feel like you wasted your time reading all that crap), read this book. Or, like me, read this book just so you can rightfully say how much it SUCKED, and was STUPID.
B00005JKC3|1.0|this is not only a SUCKY movie, but quite possibly the worst movie of 2003. The effects were more fake than Pam Anderson's melons and the plot was... wait there was no plot. Its a long boring movie about a green blob that fights giant poodles (NO IM NOT JOKING) and jumps from the middle of the desert to the GOldent Gate Bridge (WOW TALENTED!). We saw From Justin To Kelly after this, and in comparison, WE LOVED IT (that should give you an accurate idea...) (no offense American Idol fans, but that movie sucks too) I gave it 1 star only because no negatives were allowed.
B0000AQVCL|5.0|I just bought this album and my god it's awesome.  Jet is such a great band.  They have all the power and drive of their classic rock roots.  If you enjoy AC/DC, ZZ Top, The Who, Led Zeppelin, The Doors and a hundred other awesome classic rock bands like these you will love GET BORN.  It is definately one of the best albums of the year, if not the best.  <br />Just listening to it the first time you start to fall in love with the band and their familiar, yet unique, sound.  This band's influences shine true through their music yet they manage to come across with their own distinct sound and it's a great one.<br />To any of you old school rock fans out there I send a challenge not to fall in love with this album.  <br />Why haven't you bought it yet?  BUY IT NOW
B000066I6N|5.0|I can't get enough of this album.  To the point where I keep watching his VH1 Storytellers special over and over again.  Guitarist Justin Adam's sound is extremely incredible.  I can't wait to hear what they do next.  Plant has gone to knew places.  His best stuff since Fate of Nations and Physical Graffitti.
B00006879E|2.0|I bought this album after hearing the song This Love.  After listening to only a few songs I have come to the firm conclusion that this is a decent band with good talent and a possible future... if they ditch their lead singer.  The boy sounds like a shabby ripoff of Justin Timberlake and should not be allowed to open his mouth and release any vocal utterence for any reason whatsoever.  After the secon song... not second listen second song.... the album sound repetitive and whiny.  Don't buy this album unless you have a disire to listen to music that makes one desire to beat your head against a hard object.  However, there is one plus to this album.... it's better than Good Charlotte.<br />Jet's diss on this band was on target and perfectly aimed (Jet is a hundred times better go buy that album, Get Born NOW).
B00000J7JO|5.0|i havent heard the chilis old albums but this album is simply amazing i first got into the chils with songs such as by the way and cant stop. these made me buy the &quot;by the way&quot; album and from then on i was hooked on the chilis as they are such an original band there is nothing like them. i decided to buy californication as i had heard how gd it was and i was not disppointed. favourite song has to be otherside, it jus has such a simple catchy tune and great lyrics. a must buy for ne1 in search of good upbeat music.
