B004E2XAFW|5.0|Editing my previous review, I had actually never heard Within Temptation before and briefly had them confused with In This Moment who I didn't like at first but now like.  I tested this album and holy crap, this is simply amazing as can be.  Those who love this album should most definitely check out In This Moment - Blood.  Anyway, These vocals are insane as far as beauty and correlation with the melody.  I think they give Nightwish a run for their money, even with Tarja as the vocalist (though she isn't anymore, but back in the days when she was).  But I high advise anyone and everyone who loves symphonic metal, Nightwish and beautiful music to pick this album up!!!
1455502758|4.0|The black book jacket with the single word title, Mortality, provides a crisp and clear summary of what to expect in Christopher Hitchens' last book. Curious to the end, Hitchens finds just the right words to convey the experience of his dying. This fine writer's voice remains lucid as he probes the journey to his death with insight into our human situation and the fact of our mortality. Any reader who wants to engage in an exploration of dying should read this finely written book.<br /><br />Rating: Four-star (Highly Recommended)
B000002KHH|5.0|This album is one of the reasons heavy metal even exists today.  But there are five albums that invented metal, and any metal who says other wise isn't a true or real metal fan.  Black Sabbath indefinitely invented metal, hands down, no questions asked.  Some will argue on who perfected, but that's left up to the beholder.  If this isn't your collection or you haven't heard this album yet....there is an issue that must be resolved!!
B000HEWEDK|5.0|Was very happy with both the quality of the DVD and the service.<br />Item shipped very quickly and am 100% satisfied.<br />Would recommend this vendor.
B006XBSAP2|4.0|Like I have said on other reviews; I am a diehard avid heavy metal fanatical fiend.  But I downloaded this album after liking what I heard of a few second clip of \\"Wide Awake\\" on the phone app \\"Songpop.\\"  I had heard ET on the radio and thought it was ruined by Kanye's meaningless and earsore of a verse.  I ended up actually damn near loving this album.  There are only a few songs I don't like but.  I don't mind Missy Elliot but her remix was not good either.  This CD is actually worth buying if you don't have the original.  I don't usually like this genre but this is an exception.
B004EBT5CU|5.0|Amazing....simply amazing.  I am going to purchase Adele's first CD and I will certainly be following her musical career.<br />Her voice is skilled beyond comprehension.  I don't hear her transitions coming....she just nails them ever so smoothly.
B00984668E|5.0|I am not writing this review because I have anything new to add to the reviews already published.  I am writing this because I want to officially go on record and say that this album is sick.  Swagger, cockiness, strutting, fearless, fun, straight up metal sick.  Don't bother counting the riffs- no one can count that high.  Some songs might sound similar to Black Sabbath, others to Led Zeppelin, and do you know why? Because ridiculously good metal will always be compared to the greats that came before it.  The Sword is now officially ridiculously good, if not great.  Buy this album  now.<br />  Oh yeah- \\"The Hidden Masters?\\" The best metal riff since \\"Dazed and Confused\\".

B001KVZ6HK|5.0|When this was out at the cinema I went to see it 19 times, I enjoyed it so much. I'd never really been into superhero movies, but I gave this a chance & loved it so much. The action is fantastic, the script is funny & full of great lines, & the characters established so well that I had no trouble understanding their motivations even without having seen their solo movies (though I've since gone & watched them). The film is simply fantastic.

B009AMAKJU|5.0|Next to To Kill A Mockingbird and It's Kind Of A Funny Story, one of the best realistic fiction stories ever. I loved it, just saw it in the theater after knowing about it for more than a year. I read the book first, of course, and since the author, Stephan Chobsky, was so intertwined with the making of the movie, it turned out amazing. Charlie started out as the freshman I am, reading for pleasure, eating alone in the cafeteria. Patrick and Sam are probably the coolest people you could ever meet. The cast was perfect for their roles, especially Erza Miller as the energetic and unique Patrick, or Nothing ;) (for those who actually read the book or watched the movie). Emma Watson gives amazing life to Sam. Coincidentally, the whole everything of Harry Potter, books and movies, is my favorite fantasy. I can't wait till the DVD is released! And you should definitely read the book too!

0812416503|4.0|I heard about Rebecca from a friend. I googled it and found it intriguing. I borrowed it from my local library. The book is very interesting and written in a very good way. It will keep you hooked to it. I finished last half of the book over one night. Although the book is old, the story line is very interesting. A girl working for a rich lady meets a wealthy man, Mr. De Winter, and marries him. Rebecca is Mr. De Winter is deceased wife, who died drowning in water. On arriving home - a big mansion named Manderley - the girl finds that everyone such as servants, neighbors etc in Manderley talks about Rebecca and held her in high regards. The girl compares herself to Rebecca  and overtime gets depressed. This is about 60% of the book. After this the story takes a turn, few divers finds drowned body and boat of Rebecca. Mr. and Mrs. De Winter get engulfed into a several emotional and legal problems. Several mysteries now unfolds slowly with every page and readers understands many things that were not clear in the first part of the book. I will not go into more details and be a spoiler. Writer explained nature in details in few places. I found it boring, but it is very personal. Other readers may like it or despise like me.<br /><br />Overall, I enjoyed this book and recommend it, and give it a four star.
B0071XO8RA|4.0|Was looking for a new book to read, something different than what I usually read.  I saw all the amazing reviews for this book and thought, \\"Why not?\\"  The first 2 books, I admit---I wondered where it was headed.  But before long, I was hooked.  I started this book yesterday and I finished it today.  Yes...it was that good.  Would love to see this made in to a movie!

0399157565|1.0|I bought this in haste, thinking from the title that it was a Kathy Reichs book.  I stopped reading the Scarpetta series many volumes ago, and this book illustrates every single reason why.<br /><br />The narrator/central character displays a degree of arrogance that no one would countenance.  The degree to which Scarpetta behaves badly is simply unbelievable.  She is resentful that she has to appear in court, so, cavalierly, and against all advice, she just shows up an hour and a half late, wasting the time of scores of people because she does not trust anyone to do anything.  She is the only competent person in her laboratory, and no one can work without her direct supervision.  This says very little about her ability to hire people.<br /><br />All the other women--not that there are many--are nasty pieces of work or mentally ill.  The men all want to sleep with her.  Does this look like any workplace you've ever seen?<br /><br />Probably ninety percent of the dialogues are quarrels, arguments, or out-and-out fights.  There is absolutely no sense of shared enterprise or mutual reliance.<br /><br />There also does not seem to be much in the way of the display of expertise that might redeem a wooden and nasty book.
074974815X|5.0|A student of mine (Year 5) wrote the following review:<br /><br />I think this book was great and very descriptive; it was one of the best stories I have read so far in my life.<br /><br />The book is about a boy who runs away. He met a Chimpanzee, who ran away from the circus. They go all over England trying to find a good home, not a horrible one like their last ones.<br /><br />The best part was when the boy first met the chimpanzee (with its owner). It was great to read because it has so much description and a bit of action but not too much and not too little.<br /><br />I think anyone could read this book and enjoy it because I like adventure books but this one is not an adventure book. I think it was great it does NOT need improving at all.<br /><br />If you like action books then this is your book. Mr. Nobody's eyes!!!
1451695195|5.0|I first heard of Dr. Alexander last year on a podcast from the Forever Family Foundation. I couldn't get enough. His story was unlike any I'd heard about before, and I've read and listened to many hundreds via books and the internet. I searched up every YouTube and radio interview I could find with him, because his brain was NOT FUNCTIONING at the time he had this experience, unlike most NDEs where the heart has stopped but the brain was normal at the time of cardiac arrest. Google 'video a conversation with eben alexander III' to see a marvelous 50-minute interview done in April of this year at the Bioethics Forum on Near-Death-Experiences. He's been on 'Skeptico' and many other shows.<br /><br />It's true that this book, although written by the experiencer himself, does not do his story justice. It's a quick read. It's going to leave readers hungering for more... and yet, how much more do we really need? That this happened to a man of such expertise, that this brain surgeon's brain would be attacked in such an uncanny fashion that it would force him to rethink his whole basis for existence.... it's such an incredible and beautiful set of coincidences that I find myself stuck fast in the wonder each time I think of him. I am sure he could have elaborated on the things he saw, probably wanted to, but that would have taken much more time. People who have intense NDEs often take years to process the experience and glean all the data. Mellen-Thomas Benedict, another well-known intense experiencer, never did write his book, but ended up dictating it and distributing it on CDs, nearly 20 years after it happened. These powerful events disrupt everything and make it hard for the experiencer to manage his own life, let alone become a spokesperson for the afterlife!<br /><br />Dr. Alexander has many upcoming speaking engagements. One is next month in Phoenix, AZ with the Forever Family Foundation and another is in Tucson, AZ with the Tucson branch of IANDS in March 2013. He just spoke in Scottsdale, AZ a month ago at the IANDS annual conference.just spoke in Scottsdale, AZ a month ago at the IANDS annual conference.

1451695195|3.0|I've read several books on NDEs. With the ambitious title *Proof* of Heaven and the quotes on Amazon from Ray Moody and Pim Van Lommel and the fact that it was written by a neurosurgeon, this book set very high expectations.  I've been around the block enough times to suspect that the use of the word \\"Proof\\" in the title was hyperbole, just like when I read Karen Armstrong's \\"Proof\\" of God.  Again, I was right.  There's no proof of anything in this book.  It it well written although short.  It's a very quick read and it drew me in right away.  There is quite a bit about Eben Alexander's life before the NDE and that is quite interesting.  Almost as fascinating as the NDE itself is the fact that he contracted the type of meningitis he did (a 1 in 10 million chance) and that he survived the type of brain trauma he experienced as a result. The fact that the guy is upright walking around and talking is a miracle. So, you could say there are three miracles that happened to him that week.<br /><br />As another reviewer noted, I was left wanting more of the NDE itself.  Dr. Alexander talks of great insights he received while unconscious in our world.  But, what he gives us in the book are generalities that most NDE experiencers seem to bring back. Those being that we are all greatly and unconditionally loved and there is a purpose to all of this madness.  One of the unusual things about his NDE is, while in that state, he has no recollection of Earth.  I had a friend a few years ago who had two Out of Body Experiences that sound very similar to Dr. Alexander's.  He talked of places like the Core and the Gateway (mentioned in the book) and of being in a state where he had no language, no real thoughts and was just experiencing things.  I haven't heard any other NDErs describe things that way.<br /><br />Overall, the book is good.  But, if you're looking for \\"proof\\" of heaven, I'm afraid you'll have to keep looking. I've read of other NDEs where the person experiencing them, who should have no knowledge of what is going on on Earth, has been able to describe things he could not possibly know.  There's no such proof in Dr. Alexander's experience.  Dr. Alexander tries to explain why his experience couldn't have been produced by his brain.  But, while I believe him, I don't think he proves beyond any doubt that it could not have been created as he was coming out of the coma.  We've all had dreams where seconds in that dream state seem like minutes or even days.who should have no knowledge of what is going on on Earth, has been able to describe things he could not possibly know.

B00065GX64|5.0|Fritz Lang's M features a young Peter Lorre as a psychotic child murderer on the loose in Germany. His performance is chilling. The rest of the cast is also excellent as they portray various levels of society reacting to the murders and participating in the hunt for a serial killer. Lang uses music and lighting to great effect and the film is gripping from beginning to end. It is in B&W with English subtitles. For lovers of classic films this is a must see. It showcases a master at work in the creation of an atmospheric horror story with minimal technology and special effects.  You can honestly say after watching this \\" they don't make them like this anymore\\".

B007SGLZP8|1.0|The Racketeer is the second eBook that I read in as many months that falls into the Patterson Syndrome (first one being James L. Burke's Creole Belle).  Years ago I stopped buying James Patterson books because one often wonders if Mr. Patterson actually writes all the books himself (excluding ones that were co-authored).  Secondly, his plots are so contrived and his narratives meandering that Patterson may have orally transcribed 10 or 15 pages worth at a time without giving much after-thought.<br /><br />It appears that most best selling authors would eventually fall into this syndrome since they can sell novels by the sheer strength of their reputation.<br /><br />Mr. Grisham has never been known for character development, and there is none in the Racketeer.  Other reviews already mentioned that characters are two dimensional cardboards other than the protagonist's.  Whatever characterization for the protagonist is nonetheless perfunctory.  Grisham hardly ever gets into the psyche of Malcolm Bannister.  He's mentioned at multiple times to be a black attorney, trying to get his comeuppance in white-dominated social circles.  Other than the fact that Bannister is \\"wronged\\" by the federal government, in part from ignorance and in part by greed, there is really nothing to compel the reader to identify or empathize with the intentions and subsequent deeds of the main character.<br /><br />There are three acts to the Racketeer (Bannister gets out of jail, Bannister plots his revenge, Bannister exacts his revenge).  The first act is well constructed and engaging that allows the reader to develop an understanding of what lands Bannister in jail, and his strategy for exit.<br /><br />It appears, however, that Mr. Grisham mails in the second and third Acts.  The cryptic nature of the narrative keeps the reader intrigued and wanting more.  But there is neither intensity nor wit.  The plot meanders, mingled with gratuitous doses of sexual innuendos now and then.  Racketeer isa page turner for the wrong reason - there're so many irrelevant details as Grisham plugs up his narrative holes that the reader can just skip half of each page and keeps up with the plot.<br /><br />So here's the parallel between Burke's Creole Belle and Grisham's Racketeer.  The first third/half of each book is a really good read.  The second half?  Not so much.<br /><br />At least Grisham is honest.  In the Author's note, he declares that there is no need for fact checks as the entire book is fictional.  He has also relegated editing to others because of his own \\"laziness\\".  I do hope that he will be more inspired in his next effort.  The lack of craftsmanship and substance is glaring compared with his earlier work.  Perhaps writing children's books is now more to his calling?

B002MQYOFW|3.0|The Hunger Games<br />by<br />Suzanne Collins<br /><br />Made into a movie starring Liam Hemsworth better known for his sometime association with Miley Cyrus. The other `man' is Josh Hutcherson who has a much larger acting experience and the girl at the centre of it all is played by Jennifer Lawrence. Picked up a copy of the DVD but decided to read the book first so back to it. By the way the individual books are a better buy in E-Book Format than the trilogy as a whole.<br /><br />To stick with movie terminology for a moment this is  a high-concept novel written for young adults. Bucking the trend toward paranormal romance involving werewolves, vampires, and other magical creatures the people here are real but the reality they inhabit is a distopian society of an imaginary future. Genre bending it plays like a Reality TV Show the action playing out in the present with constant flashbacks to the past. Whether this be intended as a parody in the manner of Orwell's 1984 is unclear.<br /><br />The gender neutral names given the teens leaves their sex in doubt for several chapters however it soon becomes apparent that basic survival is nore important than romance here. Despite the hype surrounding Liam Hemsworth his part in the movie is played down even more than the character Gale in the book. As Jennifer Lawrence says in an interview in the supplements disk movie scripts tend to ruin the book. The reality TV Show analogy is apt, the action being to a large degree scripted, in this case totally so.<br /><br />The book and the movie are so intertwined I'll do a single blog entry regarding both. Whereas a book tells  you how it happened, a movie shows you; therefore a scene that may take several pages to set up in text passes in seconds on screen. On the other hand before CGI things the imagination can do are damn near impossible sometimes on screen. Holllywood loves young romance so it could not resist playing up the relationship between Peeta and Katniss.<br /><br />Whether or not Suzanne Collins is aware of it the short story The Lottery by Shirley Jackson published in the June 26, 1948 edition of The New Yorker bears a striking resemblence to this plot line, or should I put it the other way round. The other parallel is The Most Dangerous Game based on a short story by Richard Connell that dates back to 1924 proving that there isn't very much new under the sun.ether or not Suzanne Collins is aware of it the short story The Lottery by Shirley Jackson published in the June 26, 1948 edition of The New Yorker bears a striking resemblence to this plot line, or should I put it the other way round.

B009NQKXYK|2.0|I've been a major Ridley Scott fan since Alien - I'd watch anything he did. So Prometheus was the most anticipated of all his work and the first that I've considered a major let-down. It's a perfect example of less is more. Alien is on my top ten list of my all-time favorite movies and I could go on endlessly about how great that picture is - I won't. But its worth remembering how effective Alien is without the use of computer graphics, leaving the viewer to fill in what is not actually seen. Prometheus on the other hand is so overburdened with CGI that it becomes somewhat ridiculous and unbelievable. That's just me - I miss the old Ridley.
B009ANAQ4S|4.0|Having been a Van Fan for 44 years, I know that his new albums can take me a while to get used to.  However, Born to Sing: No Plan B has captured me from the first note. With the exception of one cut (If in Money We Trust), this is a fantastic collection of songs.  It's blusey and dynamic, with lots of brass and horns. And of course, it features one of the greatest voices ever, Van Morrison.

B007T99ENE|3.0|Ian McEwan takes the reader through some light-hearted and entertaining years, the setting revealing a simplistic plot. The reader can identify easily the young characters, many of which could have been a neighbour or friends of friends during the reader's teenage and university years. Amusing characteristics are applied to the older parents and teachers. A welomed eye into the Secret Service leaves the reader not astonished. The function and purpose of the organisation having been publicised elsewhere. The subplot of love and happiness and abandonment creates suspense and mystery for some. Loyalty to the organisation and individuals becomes important. Any discussion on how writers might feel or be treated by the powers that be is always interesting to me, another writer.
B004FGMDOQ|5.0|Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculair Children is one of the best books ever written. If you loved Harry Potter, and Percy Jackson and horror, you'll love this novel!
B006ICOK00|5.0|We read all the reviews and were a little skeptical given the range of opinions, but decided to take a chance. Fortunately the Brinno worked exactly as promised. This was a birthday present for my 13 year old son who has now filmed about a dozen things with the Brinno. The quality of the image is very good. The operation is as simple as it gets. He wants to make stop motion films so we ended up buying a $20 accessory, a stick with a button essentially, to enable that feature. All in all it was a good purchase.
B003204MQS|1.0|remember Blair Witch, same crap new cast?  How can there be more than one of these movies.  People are stupid I guess.
B009KKLQVS|1.0|Don't buy it if you think it's only a small portion of the live show. Personally, I'll wait till they release an entire concert performance. They've obviously had time to mix and produce at least one DVD so far, and it's probably to test the waters to see what people are willing to pay. Sigh.
B002VPE1AW|3.0|I'm supposed to like \\"Avatar\\". Native rights, Gaian spirituality, even a whiff of transhumanism. The bad guys are suspiciously similar to the U.S. military and a multi-national corporation, hell bent on a resource war with accompanying genocide and ecocide. The good scientist is starred by Sigourney Weaver. Gorillas in the mist, anyone?<br /><br />\\"Avatar\\" must be the movie \\"National Review\\" and the Ayn Rand Institute love to hate!<br /><br />Yet, I honestly didn't like \\"Avatar\\". I think I'm getting too old for cartoon characters. I admit that I watched it on TV. Perhaps the special effects really look great in a cinema, but on the TV screen the whole thing comes across as a Walt Disney movie with somewhat quirkier animation.<br /><br />Besides, I just cannot help reminding myself that \\"Avatar\\" is fiction, even fantasy. The Natives couldn't defeat the settlers, Gaia isn't a literal goddess, a life close to nature would frequently be grim rather than romantic... If civilization collapses, the post-apocalyptic generations won't understand \\"Avatar\\". It will be seen as a positively weird cultural artefact of a by-gone (and more prosperous) age.<br /><br />But since James Cameron really meant well when producing his little saga, I suppose I have to give \\"Avatar\\" three stars. Besides, I don't want to be attacked by a gigantic green fan dragon.
1572816295|4.0|I really like these cards, to start with. It was my second deck and the art is absolutely beautiful. They are high quality and gentle to look at.<br />There lies the one small problem, which might not be a problem for you. The artwork, though wonderful, is a little too active. There's so much going on in every card, no line weight to make the important pieces jump out at you (which would have helped a lot while keeping the idea of a detailed background), and the backgrounds were just too intricate for that. It does not ruin anything, but it does make reading take longer.<br />This deck, for all other reasons, is great. So if the above gripe would not bother you, check it out.<br />If it would, check out Paulina's Joie de Vivre deck.

B00005K3O4|5.0|This is a Halloween classic that most people will be able to enjoy! There are a few creepy parts, but most of the movie just keeps you laughing the whole time. Definitely recommend this for one of those cheesy 80s Horror flick nights.

1451695195|1.0|I sensed this book would probably be a waste of money when I bought it, but given that it was written by a Harvard educated neurosurgen, I was curious enough to at least check it out. I think Dr. Alexander was very narrow in his approach to the entire subject, especially for a 'man of science'. The book was very culturally biased, especially given the subject. It leaned entirely toward the 'Western' view of how things work. This is very evident by many of the typical Christian oriented comments about the book in the reviews. Maybe Dr. Alexander was not aware that the concepts of 'sinlessness' (\\"you have done no wrong\\")is very Eastern. The sinlessness concept is also very much at the core of the teachings in the Course In Miricles. Aside from the mention of one book by the Dalai Lama in his suggested reading list, all the others seem to be mostly by western authors.<br /><br />As a neurosurgen, I would have expected Dr. Alexander to present information about how powerful psychedelics can cause very similar experiences. He may have done well to have checked out some of work of his Harvard predecessors like Timothy Leary, or Richard Alpert and their work with LSD. Also, how about the work currently being done at John Hopkins with psilocybin and terminally ill patients? And how about the experiencs reported by users of the powerful hallciogenic drug ayahussca, which is an experiece \\"based not on the five senses, but rather a trancendental experience in a universe of multiple dimensions\\"? Does this not sound very similar to Dr. Alexanders experience? Again, I wonder how much of the Eastern spiritual systems Dr. Alexander has ever researched, especially the Tibetan book of Liberation Through Understanding In the Betweens, or better known as the Tibetian Book Of The Dead. I personally think that had he done so, his book would have been much more meaningful for me.<br /><br />I do think Dr. Alexander is very sincere in wanting to share his experience. He just needs to broaden his perspective about the experience. He is still being quite descriptively traditional to have had such a profound life changing experience.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|awesome very cool its a fun adventure I wonderbwhat you willbthink I don't know but I know I like it It likes me to jehe
B000OZ0NXA|5.0|My first Lee Childs book, and I was not disappointed. From the beginning to the end, it is a well told story. Great character development and story line. I highly recommend The Killing Floor.
B001KVZ6HK|3.0|I'm not really a super hero movie guy but this one was pretty good. After the initial recruiting the heros to fight the bad guys,the action really picked up and was non stop. 3d was pretty good,not great.
B00910Y1OQ|4.0|I like the game. But for the price I wanted more levels or sub-levels. I finished the game too soon
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|Kept hearing about this so I had to try it. This game is downright addictive and fun. At times it is very challenging.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|this game is so flipping addicting!%%% its sort of like temple but its more fun and has a better challenge and a monster chases you iinstead of stupid gorillas
B0047DVHV2|4.0|Excellent account of the life of a junkie.  Colourful characters and I appreciated the raw honesty of Keith Richards.  A compelling read.
B005LHOKFS|4.0|I like trip advisor. I am always happy with the products that are put together for this. If you like to travel you should always check out trip advisor.
B007GCY8FS|2.0|I had a hard time staying focused on the plot. The farther I read, the less believable the story became.<br />Way too many correct assumptions that led the characters to the right places and times to get the bad guys.<br />Lee Child has to get back to believable plots.
B0097C8XL0|5.0|If u are a fan of Temple run and Streaker run; this game is for u! I have played MOST of the &quot;run&quot; games ans this is by far the best of them! My 10 year old is able to so quite well on it but its still entertaining and challenging for adults. Tip: Once the game starts going fast; don't worry about collecting fish...just stay alive!
B007VUA7VO|5.0|I Luv this app its really helpful. now I know how long I can read or listen to music. WOOHOO!
B008TMA1LY|3.0|its very expensive with few incentives to encourage playing.  I dont suggest installing. this for young kids.  its time consuming with few rewards.
B002MQYOFW|3.0|Good story but it still does not have the quality of Harry potter. Plot is kind of predictable, but the protagonist is a strong female character. In short this book is what u get when you twilight with battle royal. Its also a very easy and quick read, so teens would gulp it up easily.
B008S4YZCO|5.0|I think this is a really fun game for all ages I don't know why I deleted it! 5 out of 5!
B0049VZ222|5.0|This show is so well made, shows great dynamics between characters, and it also has sick action. Make sure to go onto season 2, because it just gets better.
B007GCY8FS|4.0|This was a great book, Reacher once again doing what he does best and there is no way Tom Cruise can play Reacher! Will not see the movie but will continue to enjoy the books.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|This is a great Mah Jong game.  Some are easier than others, but if you want some challenges, you can find them here.  Love it!
B0098VXBIA|2.0|Everything funny and cute was already in the previews the rest was boring and this is coming from someone who loved romantic comedies. Too bad !
B007L3BMGA|2.0|I had heard so many great things about this book before I decided I should give it a try. So, when a close family friend gave it to me as a present, I couldn't wait to see what all the fuss was about. And I'm glad... I mean, I'm glad someone else bought it for me and I didn't spend my money on it. I gave it 2 stars because I managed to finish it. Will I read the next volumes? Probably not.<br /><br />Before saying anything else, I must mention that I've read \\"Fifty Shades of Grey\\" in Romanian and I'm glad I did this, because the translation actually made it possible for me to finish the book. It was one of those few cases when the translation is way better than the original. Should I have read it in English, I think I would've thrown it away the third time Ana Steele would've said \\"Oh, my!\\" or \\"Holy cow!\\" In Romanian, Ana sounded less annoying, though she still was as repetitive as hell.<br /><br />There were a few things I liked about \\"Fifty Shades of Grey\\" and because they were in the first half of the book, they kept me reading up to the point when I would've felt bad if I just gave it up. I liked how Anastasia and Christian interacted in the beginning and how she saw him as a challenge and tried to keep her distance, refuse some of his favors and managed to stand her ground even if she felt like melting at his feet. But then, Anastasia said \\"yes\\" to his proposal and the entire story became dull and boring. I couldn't care less about how their relationship evolved because everything was so repetitive. Grey would get mad, he'd stalk her, she'd say she was sorry, then they would have sex, she would make him mad again, get scared and then have some more sex. And it goes on and on. Maybe if the sex scenes had been as hot and swoon-worthy as so many reviews had stated, I would've liked this book more. But for a BDSM novel, most of the time the sex was quite plain and... well, normal.<br /><br />There were times when I liked Ana and times when I hated her. For instance, I liked some of her comebacks and how she made Christian feel a bit lost. But then, the nice, refreshing scene would be ruined when she immediately felt scared at the thought that she made him mad and, oh my, what if he punishes her, or worse: what if he suddenly decides she's not worth his time because she can't be submissive? And this is Ana, the female character in a best-selling novel that is being read by so many women out there: unsure, suffering of a strong inferiority complex, scared, or more like terrorized, whenever Grey's eyes grow cold. And have I mentioned unstable? Yes, I know that people have silent conversations with themselves, especially if they have to make a huge decision, but her inner voice and inner goddess are completely contradictory and no, no sane person is THAT contradictory about everything. It seemed to me that Ana had three completely different personalities trapped inside her body and I say three because she, as an individual, had nothing in common with her inner voice or inner goddess. Weird... really.<br /><br />Anyway, what I hated most about this book was the fact that the lead female character was so insecure and had such low self-esteem that she was ready to change anything about her just to please someone who made her feel like that. I do understand that Christian was sexy, hot, rich and had a dark, dark past, but all he was giving her was sex, material things and a lot of insecurities. How blind can love be? And should anyone promote such a twisted relationship?<br /><br />When I picked up \\"Fifty Shades of Grey\\" I wasn't expecting an amazing, insightful story that would leave me wondering and craving for so much more. I mean, it's erotica. I knew what I was going to read. But I did expect an engaging plot, some action and strong, confident characters that would form an explosive couple and make me be right there beside them, totally involved in their story. I struggled with the second part of the book and no, I don't think I'm going to read the next volumes.'m going to read the next volumes.
B000SEGUDE|5.0|I couldn't put the book down.  David Mitchell weaved his characters through interconnected stories which I found fascinating for a tale that spanned a period of five hundred years or so.  I also saw the movie, which stayed true to most of the book.
B0098VXBIA|4.0|Like the title says, it was surprising funny.  I was just wanting to relax and be a couch potato.  I saw other reviews of this movie (positive) and decided that I'd give this one a shot.  It was silly and sometimes corny.  But the acting was phenomenal.  The story was light..not one that I would've actually gone to a theater to see. Perfect for movie night at home.
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|Intelligent and witty.  Laughed out loud embarrassing myself on plane. Tina Fey is one smart women (person). She's the role model young girls should look up too!
B004QX07G4|5.0|This book is silly. If you're expecting any amount of substance or depth, walk away. It's just completely silly fun. It's random and ridiculous and delightful. Exactly what I was looking for.
B003ODIZL6|5.0|It is a good dictionary for looking up the meaning of a word it is easy to use and easy to read and understand.
030746363X|5.0|I just started last month and I couldn't be happier. Its a diet that gives you a cheat day every week. So far, I have lost 20.5 lbs and it's only the first month. This book is the end to your surch for a diet that is easy to follow and the biggest results. Tim Ferriss, I love you man...
B0083GQ2A0|3.0|Not my kind of movie so I didn't watch all of it. Too bloody and violent for me. My husband however continued to watch it and said the ending was a bit open.
B001KVZ6HK|4.0|Saw at the theater in 2D and loved it! We thought we'd check it out in 3D at home and enjoyed it even more. Highly recommended.
B008O9V4C2|3.0|Perhaps there was a reason Don took 10+ years between albums before.<br /><br />Same old...same old.....<br /><br />Not that it's bad....but.....ehhhh<br /><br />Put it in the cd player with his other 3 cds on \\"Shuffle Play\\"...it fits right in!<br /><br />Sounds like outakes from previous albums!<br /><br />Just sayin'....
B00846REIS|4.0|I liked it!  It's a lot like 50 Shades of Grey, but has a few differences in that it seems the characters have more personal flaws/drama...which is entertaining.
B007FTZDN8|5.0|I have made a habit of listening to at least one TED talk every night.  At a maximum of 18 minutes per talk, I'm not exactly making a major commitment of time, but I am getting a major \\"fix\\" of inspiration, enlightment, innovation, creativity and often humor.  This 'subscription' to short books that expand upon some of the talks I'm most interested in is an inexpensive investment in continuing and expanding my neuro plasticity.[[ASIN:B004K1F1W2 The Happiness Manifesto (Kindle Single) (TED Books)]] is just one example.  I get four such books a month.  A terrific bargain ... and the talks are a life-changing experience.

B005K01VZS|5.0|Couldn't put this book down. Interesting characters that the author had the priveledge of meeting in life.<br />Great lessons learned about my personal faith or lack thereof. Many thought provoking moments.<br />Enjoy author's style of writing.
0446580848|5.0|Oh, how I've missed John Corey. Love the wise ass remarks and banter throughout the book. The story moves pretty smoothly towards a typical DeMille ending. Wish there was a little more action or some twists in the middle but all in all a great read and left me wanting a follow up book asap!
B002QRWJA4|5.0|I love music and I love good movies and this brought both together. Better actos could not have been found.

B008SOS63S|5.0|Joe's cds are a safe bet. They are always full of great music. I already owned almost all of the studio records and really like them along with Live from Nowhere from a few years ago. Beacon is 2 cds-a lot of music for the money. Very happy with this set. See him live if you have a chance. Always excellent in concert.
B0052RDHTM|4.0|It was great how the author brought all these different people and classes together and the affect they had on each other.
B009NQKPUW|4.0|If you are an Aliens fan like I am, then you will like this version of the origin of the Aliens saga.  I has a very interesting construct, but not all the players are needed to support this journey.  The CG work is very good and there are links to the tie original movie that help bridge the gap in time.  Overall a very fun film to watch.
B004SBX112|2.0|This is where Amazon really drops the ball.  The Play store has the current version of seasons for free and even though I paid for this one...still waiting around for the Halloween update two days before Halloween.  Thanks again Amazon.  I wish you could get it together.  I would have bought the new Kindle Fire if the Amazon market was worth it.
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|Challenging and highly entertaining game. Graphics are well done and amusing little scenarios. I recommend to anyone 8 to ?.
B0088RQ4X4|4.0|Even with horrible reviews, I enjoyed this movie very much. Good story, something unexpected and loved the ending. Im going to purchase this movie.
B007UPNA6Y|4.0|I was hesitant about purchasing A Wanted Man for my Kindle, after many of the reviews I had read.<br />However, I was pleasantly surprised. There are many passages that are classic Lee Child/Jack Reacher, and a story line that was compelling enough to keep me reading. It may not be the all-time best book, but I enjoyed it and would recommend it.
1449410243|5.0|Based of of his website, The Oatmeal has compiled some of his best comics into this book.  A must for cat lovers.
0786868724|3.0|It wasn't as interesting as Mitch's other books. I found it hard to keep reading. Usually I can't put his books down, this one took a while to read because it was kinda boring.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|I ordered this book because all my friends who read it kept saying it was a wonderful read. When I started reading the book I thought the story line was really lacking and there was poor attention to detail. I think the author had planned on the lead female character to be an avgerage girl next door feel, but to me she lacks common sense. I guess it is true that you either love the book or you hate the book. I think how a person feels about this book is purely personality based. If your a person who is an independent thinker and does not like being told what to do, you might have a hard time connecting with this book. However, if you are a more passive person who does not like making decisions it might be a great read for you.<br /><br />I just wish the author would consider the use of better English, and use more imagination when describing the characters. I really did not like how it took eight chapters before the characters actually started to have conversations, and a realationship. The language between the characters was very hard to digest, and some times I found myself reading the same page a few times while relying on deductive reasoning to figure out what they were even talking about. The author should really consider using discriptions other than \\"cocking his head to one side\\" all the time. One chapter purely based on a contract really lost my interest.<br /><br />As a result I have not finished the book. I wish I could get my money back on this one. For me it is not like reading an Elmore Leonard novel where I cannot put the book down, and have the story described in such good detal I can imagine being right in the room with the characters. I hope my review is helpful to others so they can be more informed before spending the money on this book.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|A friend recommended this series to me for a read on a long flight. I started it in the flight Club and continued on the plane. I was not able to put it down and after we landed I continued reading into the night and finished it in the one reading. Very readable with well drawn characters. There are a few clunky moments but I quickly got over them and moved on to the climax of the book.
B007FG9LIE|4.0|I wasn't very happy about the way it ended, but it was a page turner I couldn't stop reading anyway.  Definately kept me guessing.
B005SAV9SO|5.0|This film absolutely took me by surprise because I'm not a fan of most modern comedies.  Back when it first came out, the only review that I had read about it had been negative.  So, as I settled back to watch it, I wasn't expecting to be delighted and greatly amused.  But I was.  Very much so.<br /><br />First off, the cast of this movie are all outstanding comic actors, and every single role was cast perfectly.  Cameron Diaz was nothing less than brilliant in her portrayal of an apathetic, demoralized, dope-loving lazy slob of a teacher.  It is pure joy to watch her subtle facial expressions as she deals with each new unhappy challenge that comes her way as she attempts to skate through the day with doing as little educational work as humanly possible. Diaz is absolutely fearless in playing this dissolute character.  I loved every minute of her time onscreen.<br /><br />Everyone else in the cast gives Diaz full support, including the talented Justin Timberlake as her love interest.  Every character in the movie is amusing in their own unique way.  Just about every single moment of this movie entertained me.  The comedic pace never falters and the script is truly smart and witty.  This is not one of those \\"dumb\\" comedies that Hollywood loves to unleash on the public.  Very possibly the advertising campaign for this film misled viewers to expect just another film for morons.  I can imagine that the morons in the audience were distinctly disappointed.<br /><br />\\"Bad Teacher\\" is a wickedly subversive film that just may find a way into your heart, because it makes you feel so damn good.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|Quell keeps me tapping for another level. Enticing me to keep going until I figure out the most efficient solutions to each puzzle.
B009NQKXYK|3.0|This film should have been amazing, but instead was merely okay. Everything was in place for a truly great sci-fi work: great story, amazing setting and feel and scope. But the dialog and writing is so bad. I feel like what could have been one of of the all time greats, fell rather short of its potential. Prometheus is worth seeing, but don't expect to be blown-away.
B004DLPXAO|4.0|We have it on the tablet.  It works.  I can read books on it.  They look good.<br />What can you really say about Kindle, right?  It is what it is.  And it's good enough.
1451695195|3.0|I applaud the author for telling his story to the world in the hopes that it will help others.  The author clearly had an incredible and life changing experience and instead of keeping it to himself he chose to share it to benefit others. He delves deeply into what his family went through during his coma experience in a very real and vulnerable way, which adds richness to the story.  However, I found the title misleading as I purchased the book in the hopes that it would go deeply into his near death experience, but it did not.  The author spends most of the time discussing how his family handled his coma and life threatening situation and very little time discussing what he experienced.  I do believe that it is probably impossible to put a near death experience into words, but since I am someone who believes in the after life already and am not concerned about what the scientific community thinks, I was expecting a book that discussed much more about the actual NDE.
B004SBULWE|4.0|I'm not a real detail-oriented Android user and I don't really want to spend a great deal of time tinkering with a variety of system settings, etc.<br /><br />So, this is a handy-dandy app for me.  I can whack a button and kill everything off.  Seems to save the ol' battery a bit and is remarkably simple to use.<br /><br />Is it the best of its breed?  Is it sufficiently customizable?  Does it handle all of deep details \\"properly\\" or optimally?  I have no freaking idea.  I am pretty sure it makes stuff stop running when I want stuff to stop running.<br /><br />Good enough for me.
0316228532|1.0|I loved the Harry Potter stories and I looked forward to reading something by J.K. Rowling written for adults.  Unfortunately, I couldn't finish the book--in fact, I couldn't get past the first couple of chapters.  It's just too dark.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|I have loved listening and watching The Piano Guys preform on YouTube. Being able to listen to them in my car as I drive makes my day, especially when my children (ages 1 to 7) prefer to listen to their version of songs over the original. Definitely the best $11 I have ever spent.
B009NQKPUW|1.0|The most nonesense movie ever. I kept waiting for something to develop and nothing ever did. Two hours of my life I will never get back!
B0015DWJX2|5.0|My friend is in a book club and recommended this book. I bought it because of her suggestion but didn't read the write-up on it. When I first started reading it I thought, \\"I'm not going to like this book. It's historic which I'm not really into and the story is told by letters which doesn't appeal to me usually.\\" Well, I was certainly wrong. After reading just a few letters I was hooked. I read it very quickly (for me) and loved it.  I would highly recommend this book.
B004LWZW4M|5.0|it's loud, sure, but I really liked this one the best, having seen every one of the entire collection as they were released.
0307744434|4.0|The author of this fantastic novel creates such vivid images of the circus and the impossible things that are possible there that I found myself remembering them all throughout the day. Almost like she just needed a playground for all the things she could dream up. Loved going to the circus each time I picked up the book.
159420411X|5.0|The Signal and the Noise is one of the most engaging books I have read in several years.  Silver, taking on the seemingly dry topic of prediction, creates a beautiful and winding narrative.  He uses examples from all areas of life showing humans struggles with prediction.  Each topic is covered with an appropriate amount of depth, providing numbers and examples without overwhelming the reader.<br /><br />I would highly recommend this book to anyone with even a cursory interest in prediction, politics, betting, weather, or statistics.
B008HK3XKO|4.0|Well I got this item because I got a kindle fire HD 7\\" and it fits in it perfectly. I like the design and color and I'm very satisfied with the quality.
0761163808|5.0|My sons were captured by the moving images on the cover and within the book and I was transported by the safari stories so well-written by Ms. Kaufmann.  Both informative and entertaining - something for the whole family to enjoy!
B00005JKG9|5.0|This DVD came in the original packaging, even though it was priced similarly to used items.  It's exactly what I ordered.
B005LAII62|4.0|This film was released in late summer.  While watching it I kept wondering why this film wasn't released for Halloween.  There are haunted houses, ghosts, witches,  etc.  It's not a summer teen slasher film, but an animated family movie that involves the \\"6th Sense\\" plot of a boy seeing and talking to dead people.  Paranorman has the stereotypical characters of the loving but disagreable parents, the school bully, and the wayward kid who befriends Norman because he is also \\"unusual\\".  He also has a drunken estranged uncle who knows what Norman is going through and before he becomes a ghost himself, tells Norman how it all started and how he can solve his problem.<br /><br />For fans of animation or horror films, this movie will satisfy. The movie didn't seem that much of a family movie since it involves an animated car chase crash (which everyone survives) and a very realistic scary looking whirling skystorm. It is funny enough to keep audiences entertained with the over-exaggerated expression and body proportions of the animated characters.  Norman is just that kid you think is weird but still know there's a \\"reason\\" behind his weirdness.  Paranorman is a pretty good horror film that just happens to be an animated feature.
B0052RDHTM|1.0|I found this book disappointing, trite, repetitive and boring.  This story could have been a magazine article rather than a saga-length book.  Esther

B000OLRH10|5.0|This is a great movie, I've seen it several times already, and each time, I learn something new.  Worth 2.5 hours of your time to see what it was like in Sierra Leone during the war...paired up with great acting, and action!
B003ODIZL6|4.0|Needs a thusourus     but the rest quite good no more buying dictinaries at the store so yea great book so bye
B009NQKPUW|2.0|The movie started out well with an original story line but seem to loose steam and origanility by morfing into simular scenes of Alien where the ailen being captures and uses the body of another as a host or birth chamber. You end up feeling like you've been there seen that.

B00910Y1OQ|5.0|nice content. I like it. smooth game play and cool artwork. this is the first game I have ever rated. Great time killer.
B0090O07RS|3.0|The sound is amazing, but I'm surprised no one has mentioned that the video is cropped.  The concert was originally filmed 1:33 full frame, and there has been some cropping to get it to fill the 1:85 widescreen frame.  Very annoying!  Ray does mention that they did some digital work on it so that it wasn't stretched out (like when someone plays a full screen video in widescreen, it gets squished so it fills the frame), but if you compare some shots, they definitely cropped it somewhat.
B009NQKXYK|3.0|This could have been a classic.....could have been. Great special effects, as always, but storyline is way too slow developing! Din in background makes dialog difficult to understand. Three ***'s is the best I can do here.

B009GENZ12|4.0|I am extremely critical of movies these days. I am not easily entertained. This movie was not what I expected at all. It kept me engaged and guessing the entire time. This is a great movie, and I absolutely recommend it to everyone. It's one that I would definitely watch again!!

B009NQKPUW|4.0|The movie was quite entertaining!  Streaming began almost immediately and I did not have any problems with watching the film.
B0052QXAEK|2.0|I've been wanting to see this movie because I love Beauty and Beast as a storyline, despite the fact that I hate the Disney version with Belle, Gaston, and the teacups.  But what a disappointment this movie was.<br /><br />First, perhaps the disappointment is my own fault.  This is, after all, a very teeny-bopper movie.  However, there have been very good teeny-bopper movies in the past (i.e. Clueless, Mean Girls).  My biggest criticism of this movie is that it plays as something that just didn't have much financing behind it.  Hence, the poorly written script, which contained very cheesy lines (perhaps they work in a book form, or maybe better actors would have been able to do them more justice), poor character development (what makes Hunter change? why does Kyle/Hunter even like Lindy? the housekeeper and the tutor deserve more time to really flesh out their characters and the role they play in Kyle's transformation), and sub-par acting.<br /><br />I have not read the book, and can only imagine that it was much better for a movie to have been made of it.  I've seen some pretty good reviews for this movie, though, and I can only suppose that those who enjoyed the movie read the book first and absolutely loved the book to the point where they were able to forgive the movie.  Otherwise, I can't account for any of the positive reviews.
B005USZYDU|5.0|This book is amazing! Great for children, teenagers, and adults too. Read this, you'll be glad you did!!! I highly encourage you to read it!
B006R8GK2Q|5.0|This is my favorite of the hidden object games I have played so far. It has lots of levels so there is a lot of gameplay.The mini games are challenging without being frustrating. It works great on my fire.
0061726834|1.0|Pales in comparison to other YA dystopian books. Undeveloped and immature characters - the main character is 17 going on 10. In this book, there is such a lack of description, I couldn't picture this world. I never felt like I was \\"in\\" the book. Hunger Games and Divergent had me completely immersed in the worlds the authors created.<br /><br />Many have said the writing is wonderful - I thought a 15 year old could do better.<br /><br />The only thing I liked about this book is that implies that organized religion (Christianity) is corrupt and those who follow it are nothing more than \\"zombies.\\" That religion is only a version of propaganda to force us to think a certain way and become droids. Too bad this aspect wasn't developed more - it might have made the story interesting.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I really enjoy this game on my kindle fire. It is a good brain teaser for any age.  My kids like to play it,  too.
B003TSEEDY|1.0|I heard this was such a good book. Quite frankly I was disappointed. I didn't like how it was written. It was too choppy. Major upset.

B008220DGE|5.0|Often in the history of film there have been remarkable gems, hailed by few and ignored by the masses.  Over time many of these gain the credit they deserve, Citizen Kane was panned by many critics at the time and only with the passing of time has its influence and brilliance been generally acknowledged.  P.T. Anderson's new film The Master may not be Citizen Kane  but it is certainly in the same vein.  As Orson Welles modeled Charles Foster Kane after William Randolph Hearst, Anderson's new film focuses on another controversial historical figure, L. Ron Hubbard.  Like Welles, Anderson treats his characters with the same mixture of examination and empathy that leaves you questioning pre-conceptions and wondering what truly defines an individual.<br /><br />In post-war America Freddie Quell (played by Joaquin Phoenix) , a former soldier with an abnormal libido and a hobby of making near toxic alcohol, is wandering through life like an actor oblivious of his stage.  His course takes a slight detour when he wakes up aboard a ship with Lancaster Dodd (Philip Seymour Hoffman) and his followers who make up \\"The Cause\\", a cult-ish religion clouded in the guise of science, philosophy and psychology.  Dodd sees in Quell the opportunity to display the power of his new methods, and in Dodd Quell sees a mentor and hope for answers to the questions that plague all humanity.<br /><br />Like many of Anderson's films the pace can often be trying and the often surreal visions expounded are certainly not for everyone's taste.  Images of swirling water are only a drop in the bucket of metaphors Anderson buries his audience in.  Like Anderson's last film, 2007's There Will Be Blood, gorgeous imagery and an eerie score help create a dream-like sense of bewilderment that stays with you long after the lights go up and the popcorn is stale.<br /><br />Anderson's ability to craft film as art is only matched by his eye for talent. Philip Seymour Hoffman, in his fifth collaboration with Anderson, plays Dodd with wonderful simplicity that allows the complexity of the character speak for itself.  With subtly and reserve Hoffman lets his character's egotism and  magnetism shine through Anderson's typically biting dialogue.  Joaquin Phoenix, still recovering from his 2010 film debacle I'm Still Here, gives a powerhouse performance reminding us all what was so intriguing to begin with.  Somehow Phoenix makes a character who should come off as a simpleton violent alcoholic a very empathetic and human individual.  In the end he is still not very likeable, like many people in this world, but you can nevertheless sympathize with his mortal struggle.  Whether or not Phoenix will get the Best Actor Oscar as many have discussed is still anyone's guess, especially with the multi-Oscar winning Daniel Day Lewis (who won his second Oscar for Anderson's There Will Be Blood)  in the competition.  Rounding out the cast is Office darling Amy Adams as Dodd's wife Peggy, who has a far more pragmatic view of the relationship between Dodd and Quell.<br /><br />It is a tragedy how often brilliance is not recognized by those in its presence.  P.T. Anderson with masterpieces like Boogie Nights, Magnolia and There Will Be Blood under his belt would surely be Oscar material, but he is not.  After the fall when Spielberg and all the other mainstream directors release their fare Anderson's little art film will receive little attention.  He may get a nod with yet another nomination, but the sad truth is that his work may simply be ahead of his time.  Just as his films are too \\"arty\\" for mainstream box office success the Oscars are too mainstream for him.  So maybe he won't get the award until he's thirty years deep like Scorsese or perhaps never at all, but perhaps that's okay. After all he is in good company, there have been other perfectionist film makers who never won the Best Director statue, like Orson Welles.

B009YDAUJ0|3.0|The first two episodes of season Three were excellent in every way!  This episode -- episode Three -- was not what I want to see from The Walking Dead.  The group wasn't shown at all in this entire episode, and they are the ones I enjoy watching.  The show is going in a different direction in this episdoe and I really don't care for it.  I usually give every episode FIVE stars, but this one I can only give THREE.  I do not enjoy when these types of shows/movies end up in a place where weapons are taken and people are treated as slaves.
B003WTE886|4.0|Not as good as Fearless (tough act to follow) but a little better than her debut.  Definitely a worthwhile purchase - here's how I rank the songs from 10 - awesome to 1 - terrible:<br /><br />1. Mine - 9<br />2. Sparks Fly - 8<br />3. Back to December - 8<br />4.

B008AU7F3C|5.0|Years waiting and this album does not disappoint! It's certainly a more matured musical style of Khan's that any fan can appreciate artistically and spiritually. It blends mysticism with air and water; pianos, strings and drums with electronics. There's a wonder and mysterious void in every piece. I definitely recommend listening through this album a few times to really appreciate it though.<br /><br />Here are my reviews of the songs by my most favorite to least (which was surprisingly hard to decide because they pretty much are all fantastic).<br /><br />All Your Gold - This song really surprised me. The first listen through, I liked it but wouldn't have called it my favorite. It wasn't until the subsequent replays where I really discovered the magic in this one. Now it's my absolute beloved from the album (surpassing Laura which I'd loved since its release in July). All Your Gold is simple, but it's got a nice beat and the clinking percussion is major plus. Whenever the chorus comes on, I can't help but sing along. The lyrics are definitely one many people can relate to. I know I do. The 3:00 minute mark is really where I start absolutely loving the song--how the violins come in and it builds! And then the ending strings? Perfect.<br /><br />Laura - Oh, this beautiful melancholic and hopeful song. It's so bare but so full of warmth. When the single released in July, I was all over this one. Like All Your Gold, the first play through was definitely an adjustment for me because I was so used to the music from Bat For Lashes' first two albums and this one seemed a little differently jarring, but once I got over the initial listen, I loved Laura. This is one of the few songs on the album that really utilizes the piano and I do so enjoy piano pieces. Natasha Khan's voice is as powerful and haunting as ever. It's just a beautiful piece altogether.<br /><br />Rest Your Head - I was instantly drawn to Rest Your Head the moment I played through the entire album. There's some of Khan's trademark mystic-tribal sound in it that the rest of the album seems to have toned down a little bit in comparison to her past albums. It's got a great beat and I love the melody. I've been running to it a lot lately. Doesn't hurt that the lyrics say \\"keep on running\\" at various parts! Definitely one of my favorites.<br /><br />Horses of the Sun - This song always gets my imagination going. Very visual language. I see these rocky shores on an overcast day and then powerful, wild horses running from the ocean as the sun breaks through. It's very energetic and continuously pumps me up. The commanding drums probably contribute to that.<br /><br />Winter Fields - Starts out with flutes that build this whole quiet, folk scene. That quickly dissolves as the strings kick in and then the percussion. I find this one very similar to Horses of the Sun as it definitely energizes me and gives me great visuals. I see these windy snow storms on sturdy baron lands and then quiet, white nights as she goes between strength in sound and mellowness.<br /><br />The Haunted Man - The song that inspired the album's name. It has a very airy quality, and again some marching drums--Khan seems especially fond of them in this album. The male choir in the middle of the song is certainly its special element. I remember reading that they'd recorded their singing over a canyon or some other big space to give it a natural distant sound. When Khan's voice comes back in, the music takes on a more driving, powerful quality that rises to its climax and then suddenly dies down into the ending. Also very energetic, and hopeful. It has a historic feel to it overall.<br /><br />Deep Sea Diver - The longest song on the album. It takes about a minute and a half to get into the main tune, but once it does it's well worth the wait. There's a delicate piano and overall watery feel that makes you feel as though you are just floating within a quiet ocean. Like a deep sea diver! Definitely the most mellow track of the album. Very soothing.<br /><br />Oh Yeah - When I first heard the live version of this song, I didn't think the studio version would be as synthesized in instrumentation. I wasn't too fond of it initially, but I liked the beat and melody enough to keep listening. It's earthy sounding with a hint of zany enchantment. Very rhythmic and sway-worthy. I absolutely love the whimsical piano runs that start in the middle and ends the song. It definitely gets better with every listen.<br /><br />Marilyn - Marilyn starts out like a lazy beach day at sunset, where you're just rocking back and forth on a hammock. It's relaxing (initially), but then the chorus comes in and as Khan's pitch escalates, you are suddenly reaching with her for something more alive and vibrant. It's very uplifting.<br /><br />Lilies - The introductory song. It's fresh, starts out crisp and mellow, reminiscent of the morning time. It's definitely a good song to start. It almost, in a way, sets the tone of the album because of its sudden synth bass. The album is a lot more electronic sounding than her previous in my opinion. All the same, it all merges well with her other fanciful/influential instruments and peculiarly refreshing tunes.<br /><br />A Wall - While I love all the songs off of Haunted Man, this one would have to be the weakest out of that strong love for me. I still can't exactly pin why that is though. It's got a good beat and some fun wacky electronic sounds, but it seems to be lacking some general punch.<br /><br />All in all, this album is a win for me. I haven't stopped listening to it since I bought it last week.
B0014I4KH6|4.0|Solid collection of songs with OK singing.  Never really liked her weak voice much, but the songs are strong enough to carry the day.  All the songs are good and especially like Tim McGraw, Teardrops On My Guitar, Stay Beautiful and I'm Only Me When I'm With You.  Get her other CDs first (1. Fearless, 2. Red, 3. Speak Now and then this one, but all are worthwhile.)  Here's how I rank the songs from 10 - awesome to 1 - terrible:<br /><br />  1. Tim McGraw - 8<br />  2. Picture To Burn - 8<br />  3. Teardrops On My Guitar - 9<br />  4. A Place in this World - 8<br />  5. Cold As You - 8<br />  6. The Outside - 8<br />  7. Tied Together with a Smile - 7<br />  8. Stay Beautiful  - 9<br />  9. Should've Said No - 6<br /> 10. Mary's Song (Oh My My) - 8<br /> 11. Our Song - 7<br /> 12. I'm Only Me When I'm With You - 9<br /> 13. Invisible - 8<br /> 14. A Perfectly Good Heart - 7
B006LSZECO|4.0|I just finished this book an hour ago, and I'm still thinking about it.  A good read, though a little slow in the beginning, but I couldn't put it down yesterday or today.  No winners in this story, unless Amy's last word is as vicious as her plan. I didn't expect the ending, a good surprise, but unsatisfying in that I still don't know what happens to Nick.  Don't much care about Amy.  What did Boney want to tell him?  Is he at least afraid of her, he should be.  Can't help it, I'm from the happy ever after era, good always wins and justice is for real.....but then maybe they just deserve each other, and the poor child will be caught in the middle of this viciousness......

B0088EDMMS|2.0|First let me say that the 2 star rating is for the Blu-ray combo pack, not the film. As Disney well knows now that this film has become a cult classic as well as one of the most watched Halloween flicks on tv every year. Yet once again we get a bare bones release. And a extra copy of the DVD released back in the early 2000's. The transfer of the movie to blu-ray looks nice, clean and a little more colorful. But barely. I was really hoping for deleted scenes(which there are plenty), behind the scenes and maybe some interviews. But Disney completely dropped the ball. Maybe someday they'll get a clue.<br />  Also a heads up to people purchasing &#34;The Muppet Christmas Carol&#34;blu-ray as it will not feature the full cut of the film that a previous DVD had. What is going on Disney!?!
B002BU0DPE|3.0|Ive had 3 pair of these and all 3 have stopped working after just a few months play. And im a light gammer. They work very well when they are working but they dont seem to have any lasting power. Cheaply made. I think when it comes to headsets, you pretty much get what you pay for.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|When i started reading Fifty Shades of Grey it was because of a very good recommendation from a friend, that made me buy the book  first thing after she told me what the book was about. I loved the way the writer described things that happened and the way the history turned out to be so interesting. And how things that you never thought you would like, the writer shows you in a way, that makes you think throught it and even consider it, because you are able to feel what the character is feeling in the moment. To like the second book it's not hard at all. You get all the characterists of the first and even more, so Fifty Shades Darker is even better, you are never tired of reading, on the contrary, you want to read and know what is going to happen next. It's a captivating, attractive, appealing, exciting, rousing romance book, period!

B007TBZ63Y|4.0|Here is how my kids who are real readers of the book reviewed this book:<br /><br />Kid 1:<br />The ending of this book was horrible! I really liked that the characters finally got together, but once again a total cliff-hanging ending, I can't wait another year to see what happens :( it just goes so awesomely and then it just stops. it can't stop there!!!!!!!!!!!<br /><br />Kid 2:<br />The book was really great. The characters from the Lost Hero and The Son of Neptune finally met and go on the a combined quest. But, i think that the ending was not good because of the cliff hanger.
0062127241|5.0|Who I Am by Pete Townshend<br /><br />With British blood flowing through his veins Pete Townshend straps the reader in his psychedelic rocket ship and reveals a narrative of his life in his book Who I Am.<br />At their first gig performing as The Who a hole in the ceiling appears as Pete accidentally throws his guitar a little too high. Hearing the audiences response to this chain reacts an adrenal rush inside Pete causing a rock star to be born that night.<br />The Who would become known for it's loud epic natured songs. Keith Moon throwing drumsticks high in the air and standing on his drum kit. Roger Daltrey swinging his microphone and bashing it into cymbals. John Entwistle standing like an oak tree in the middle of a tornado, and Pete Townshend dressed in his white boiler suite and doc marten boots jumping, kicking, and swing his arm like a windmill. This vision will become a permanent staple in Rock & Roll history.<br />With an emotional look back on his life, Pete Townshend shares with the reader his greatest triumphs with The Who and scripting Tommy. His sentimental relationships he groomed. The people he met who helped shaped his need to establish new musical territory such as Jimi Hendrix. The deaths of close friends and band members Keith Moon and John Entwistle, and his confrontation with tabloid type accusations of child pornography.

B001U7WUW8|5.0|Being a huge fan of Green Day since I was a kid (circa the release of Dookie, by the way) it is only natural that I am glad I can finally own it in vinyl. Knowing every song of this band as I do, I can guarantee this is one of their best and most creative works, next to \\"Nimrod\\". If you are a punk rocker you probably already know it, but if you aren't, then I tell you that this album IS A MUST HAVE!
B008XG1X18|3.0|crashes DAILY on Kindle Fire - please to fix?! Other than the CONSTANT crashing I like the application and had been wishing for it in this format. Fix! It! please.
B001I10ABO|5.0|Metallica was the first cassette I bought, when I was a kid. I grew up listening mainly to punk rock, but I always loved this album (I still have the cassette tape) and as a grown up, I believe I have more taste in music to appreciate it, so I bought the vinyl and realized that there is much more to know about Metallica than I did. So if you are a heavy metal fan, you should get this album (and also buy \\"Kill'em All\\").
B00005A46U|3.0|This CD shows is harder to accept than the first, but it's still good. This is the mark of the Caravan, quiet songs, but more introspective, psychedelic. Would not recommend as a first disc to buy, but not to give up when you like progressive rock. The remastered version is good with interesting bonuses. Rating: 6.5 (maximum).
B00005O5UJ|5.0|If you look closely at he bottom of the back of the OBI Strip, you will see two dates in a small rectangular box, 01-10-31 (10-31-2001 in the U.S.) and 96-6-17 (again, 6-17-1996).  This means that the 2001 release is a REISSUE of the 1996 release.  It also means that the Remastering is the same as the [[ASIN:B000003JDO 1996 25th Anniversary Special Edition]].  That said, to MY ears the Japanese CD sounds MUCH better than the 1996 release, for whatever reason.  If you can't afford to purchase the super expensive [[ASIN:B00000018N DCC Gold CD]], which I admittedly have never heard, but seems to garner rave reviews (although I've never \\"bought in\\" to the supposed superiority of Gold CD's), it would be worth your while to track down this version.  It also comes in an EXACT mini replica of the original LP sleeve, including the lyric printed inner sleeve and textured jacket! (Constructive criticism or opposing views are welcomed, but trolls and haters please move on......)<br /><br />Other fine JETHRO TULL reissues: [[ASIN:B00166BL6Y THIS WAS (2CD Collectors Edition)]], [[ASIN:B003YP7N9O STAND UP (2CD+DVD Edition)]], [[ASIN:B00005NTJK BENEFIT]], [[ASIN:B000000IW5 LIVING IN THE PAST (2CD Mlps)]], [[ASIN:B008S6B480 THICK AS A BRICK (40th Anniversary Special Edition)]], [[ASIN:B000B5Y0MI JETHRO TULL Nothing Is Easy: Live at the Isle of Wight 1970 CD+DVD]]
B0071XO8RA|5.0|One of the best reads I've come across in a long time.  Checked out the story with the free version of Wool 1 and then picked up the entire set.
B009CPJHY4|3.0|Like I said in the tittle...I thought it was cute...but no highs or lows....just putted along. My husband didn't like it. We'd heard it was funny...but we didn't really think so.
0451532082|2.0|This is a book that just beats you over the head again and again with moral instruction; as a result, I found it to be just barely readable (especially the first half).  To be fair, I could imagine grownups wanting their children to read this- especially since the parents in this story (and two of the four sisters) are so cloyingly perfect that they make Biblical heroes seem like gangsters in comparison.<br /><br />But I personally found it to be unappealing.  It is basically a bland story of bland girls obeying blandly likable authority and doing well by doing so.  In a sense, it is kind of the anti-Huck Finn. (In The Adventures of Huckelberry Finn, the title character grows morally by trying to free a slave, essentially battling authority).
B0071XO8RA|4.0|Entertaining read, left wishing for more.  It will keep you occupied till the end but not really a series worth remembering or recommending.  There is just nothing unique about this book
B0090EKRKU|2.0|My kids like the movie just fine. The younger one said it was \\"good\\" and the older said it was \\"okay\\". I couldn't even make it through to the end.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|Love it, I like the different orientations and colors. I wanted one that was bigger so I could see it clearly.  Got what I wanted.
B009NQKPUW|2.0|Not much happens, none of it makes any sense, and it's unfinished (since it's the first of a planned trilogy).  If you love sci-fi, don't watch this.
1451696191|4.0|Bought the book with the idea of using it for my kids. I had not seen the movie, but prefered to read the book first. After I finished it, I decided the language and content was a little too much for my tweens. I did understand the authors thoughts of bringing out the fact of being different from the others. But I would hope adults would read it first.
0345529057|3.0|To start, I bought the boxed set and read all 4 books, one after another. The first two are excellent; full of action and plot and twists. I loved it. The 3rd book is good, but slower with more descriptive narrative and lists(weapons, cooking materials, tree types, etc.), less plot and less action. The 4th book, lot's of slow chapters with overly detailed descriptions of food and clothing and room contents; very painful at times. And in the end after reading 4000 pages there is no conclusion and George Martin says you got to read the 5th book which will answer questions, but that 5th book apparently has more descriptions and less action than the 4th and leaves more loose ends and encourages the reader to wait for the 6th book. I like the books, but they leave you frustrated thinking, \\"why did he waste so much time on meaningless description when he could have been moving the story along?\\" I have serious doubts about buying more only to be told that I will never get the gratification of a completed story. Which leads me to \\"my fat man up the hill\\" analogy.  When walking up a hill, a fat man starts out strong; starts to huff and puff half way up; slows down a lot after the midpoint and seems to drag it out,  never seeming  to make it to the top.  I'll probably buy the 5th and 6th book because I'm hooked, but only a craven would lead an honest reader along like this.
B008FSCNTK|5.0|Have been sharing my CD with friends who will buy their own copies.  She reminds me of Peggy Lee!  YeeHaaaaa!
B008NABUU8|4.0|it's a fun game, makes you think. the interface can be a little tricky, sometimes choosing a material is difficult and its easy to place something wrong.
B002SRQ214|5.0|It's an AMD 965 BE.  It works out of the box on an Asus M5A97 R2.0.  Didn't configure anything - it just worked.  I haven't overclocked it yet, probably won't either.  Not that interested in overclocking.  I bought the BE version because of the price.  Runs at 3400Mhz and stays about 40-45 degrees C while gaming under a Cooler Master 212 EVO.  Only con would be that AMD should have taken this CPU series, added 4 more cores to it, and built it with the 32nm foundry, clocked it to 4.5GHz and called it BULLDOZER.  At any rate, I've always built AMD systems for about 20 years, never a problem, and this CPU continues that trend.  For less than $100 it's a good band for the buck.
B0063GORYU|5.0|Good way to spend time. Like that i can play in both portrait and landscape views. Would be nicer if i could change the deck design but that doesnt take away grom the game.
B008TRUDAS|4.0|After reading good reviews, I put off buying this book for a while due to having a bad experience with another book that had amazing reviews which turned out to thoroughly suck for me. This time, my faith on relying on good reviews has been restored, yey!<br /><br />Take of 1/2 star for the sad things happening to the heroine. It reminded me a bit of North & South by Elizabeth Gaskell(?) - being uprooted from your home, parents dying one after the other, how much sadness can the heroine go through?<br /><br />Taking of another 1/2 star for the heroine's constant sobbing. For. Every. Bad. Thing. That. Happened. She kept crying and crying and crying. Come on! You can be sad & pissed off without having to resort to tears all the time.<br /><br />Other than the 2 above, the story was actually beautiful, in spite of the sadness. The hero, oh! I completely understood what he was feeling, why he felt so torn. He is swoon-worthy, in my opinion. They were 2 people who I really felt deserved each other, in a good way.
145210655X|5.0|Darth Vader and Son is a wonderful book that you can buy for your child who's a Star Wars fan. If you have seen the movies, the jokes will be immediate and humorous for you. The premise of the book is Darth Vader being a father to Luke, given some situations from the movies. My son loves it and your child will too. I highly recommend this book for Star Wars fans big and small.
B003L77GGA|4.0|I got this bluray within 3 business days of purchase which was great.  It was brand new like it said.  No scratches and no damage to the box.  The show itself was good.  I feel that the ending was very fitting and that the last season had a decent story line with a decent ending.
B004M3GDI4|1.0|I had to send this headlamp back. I had been looking for a light weight, stream lined headlamp and the description seemed to fit the bill, as did the photos. I was fooled. When the package came and I put the batteries in and discovered that the headlamp was larger in size and heavier than my $5 cheapie from Home Depot that we use to fix the car in an emergency. It simply did not meet expectations. I was looking for a step up from the cheap one and got a step down in regards to size and weight.
B005H9B44A|5.0|I loved the movie and the star. I was really happy to see the whole bunch in Avengers. I wanted to buy the 10 disc but saw that it is not available yet. I'm waiting.
B004MC8CA2|4.0|I like the bible on my phone,  very easy to get to and use. Looking to get some more items from amazon.
B008WCP2KG|2.0|The bodies were good. The dancing was good. The acting was poor. Did not like Matthew McConaughey's role at all. He was a real sleeze. He is too good of and actor to play a role like that.
B002ZG99A4|2.0|I ordered this used product based on the cost and description. When the product arrived, I discovered that the plastic case was broken (not that big a deal). More importantly, however, it only had the Blu-Ray disc in it (even though the paper insert clearly mentioned a total of 3 discs (2 DVD/1 BR). It has obvously been repackaged since there was only a spot for one disc...  Very disappointed.
1465001107|5.0|Gorgeous, gorgeous pictures of Michael especially December - yeow!  I can't wait to put it up!  Very nicely done.  Much better than some I've bought in previous years with distracting swirls and too much coloration around the pictures.  This is just pure Michael!
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|The movie arrived exactly on time and as described.  Loved the movie - lots of action and plenty of humor.
1608871517|5.0|Gorgous, gorgeous book!  This is a MUST for any MJ fan but also an amazing look at the world of fashion surrounding and created by a megastar.  Beautiful pictures, amazing sketches and fascinating text about Michael Bush's 25 year career and friendship with Michael.  It is a real labor of love and Bush's loyalty and deep affection for Michael is very moving.  I have read dozens of books about Michael Jackson but this is one of the best.  Thank you, Michael Bush, for loving, creating and caring for Michael all those years.  Your book is as much a tribute to Michael and your friendship with him as it is about his iconic fasion.  My heart goes out to you, also, in the loss of Dennis Tompkins.
B009346RSS|5.0|I have several devices plugged into my Panasonic plasma TV. About the best I can say of the TV sound is that it's surprisingly good considering the limited space. I didn't want to buy a sound bar as I have a pair of Mackie MR5 studio monitors that I believe sound much better than a sound bar. This TV does not downmix to stereo, so I had to set up my Blu-ray player to provide two-channel output. The cable box already was two-channel.<br /><br />The sound quality is just fine. I was really looking for a cheap DAC that has remote volume control but they don't seem to exist so my old stereo amplifier provides the volume function.<br /><br />I was impressed by the design e.g. status lights.
B009KHBDUU|2.0|I am a fan of the original series. I was really excited to see how Burton and Depp treated this as fans. But it was obvious from the get that they were trying too hard to make it their own and they just couldn't decide if they were going to go with comedy or camp. I would have enjoyed a really dark campy movie that would have bitten off the first say two to three seasons of Dark Shadows. They're eyes were too big and they over-extended themselves. Not to mention that their attempts at comedy and camp just ended up looking like bad writing and over production. I was not impressed. I did like Depp's look. That's one star and another star for including Alice Cooper (I won't spoil the surprise). But everything else is just blah.
0385535147|5.0|I'll be the first to concur that Mr. Grisham is indeed America's best story teller, but his last few books just didn't quite do it for me. The Racketeer, however, is a great read and left me satisfied. Great plot and pace, he is still capable of delivering tasteful, elegant revenge. I was unsettled at the protag's shallow character at some points and, as another reviewer mentioned, some of the events were a wee bit fanciful. However, this is a work of fiction as stated in the \\"Author's Note.\\" Thank you, Mr. Grisham! Good luck on the golf course, but please get busy on your next book!
B008WCP2PG|3.0|Maybe someday there will be a great movie that captures the essence of the life of the male stripper.  This isn't it.<br /><br />This is a dark movie, literally as well as figuratively.  Most of the non-stripper footage was shot in this yellowish sepia tone.  We get it, it's a seedy, depressing sort of life.<br /><br />Channing Tatum is the new Patrick Swayze - a guy who can't act but can move like crazy and is just fine to look at. It's just intriguing enough that this movie is based on his own life experience.  Because we were already fantasizing about watching him strip anyway.  The dancing scenes are shot in that flash-frame seizure-inducing style that allows an R Rating in spite of frankly raunchy content.<br /><br />Not much in the way of a plot - guy who has more noble aspirations than stripping, but making money as a stripper to try to achieve those goals, meets a very young and rather clueless other guy and recruits him into the fold.  Young guy messes up royally and doesn't even realize it.  A few other guys and gals fill out the picture, including the mandatory creepy club owner.<br /><br />Cody Horn as Adam's sister is the most \\"normal\\" character in this movie.  She is definitely the most complex, but it doesn't quite work for me.  She is dour and uptight.  It's hard to believe that Mike could convince her to hang out in the first place.  Then when they do spend time together, she laughs at everything he says.  The transformation is not convincing.<br /><br />The message here is that there's nothing redeeming about the stripper lifestyle, that you adopt it out of desperation, and if you're good enough you make a lot of money.  I know, it's pretty pathetic that I'm looking for a message.  Yes, hot guys dance and strip a lot in this movie.  That's really the only reason to watch it.
1451695195|2.0|Tagged this book to my wishlist and waited eagerly for its release for over a month, so perhaps I was expecting too much when it was finally released. With each page, I hoped for more of his NDE but, alas, there's very little specific information relevant to the actual NDE. I am not sure why others seek out NDE information - perhaps there's a real need in the world to explain them or rationalize them or somehow reconcile the spiritual world with the scoffing scientific community - if that was this book's purpose it may have hit the mark, but it did not satisfy me. I seek a better understanding of life - its meaning and our purpose. Perhaps the doctor's NDE resonated for him, but it did not speak to me at any real depth.
B009NQKPUW|2.0|Seems to me, we've seen all this before???  Exploration, leads to terror, leads to monsters, leads to crew all dead, one female survivor !?!?!  Come on Ridley, really....
1455508977|5.0|What a fantastic book. What a sweet love story. So well written it scared me at the end but I won't give the ending away for those of you that haven't read it yet. Please give this book a read you will love it!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|it won't let you go to store to get stuff after you play for a long time so take a break and see what happeneds . this only happens on the kindle fire.
B000Q76K1A|4.0|All of the Bourne movies are great. Jason Bourne never lets you down. I took my son to see the most current one at the theater and he hadn't seen the old ones.  I am enjoying watching them again. It has been a while.
B007RQ6WCA|5.0|Excellent program. Execute what it promises to do. Do we have drop Box also in Mac? How do we integrate it to the iCloud?
1455527475|4.0|grand prose from a culture carrier, a team member, reminding wall streeters to focus on asking clients what they need, not just getting them to buy what you have.
B008SOS63S|4.0|Good CD set. Joe Bonamassa is always something good live; this one was a bit special. He had guest appearances by Beth Hart, John Hiatt, and Paul Rodgers. The Beth Hart songs were just okay, but John Hiatt had a very cool song called 'Down Around My Place'. Paul Rodgers and Joe reimagined two songs by Free; 'Fire and Water' (My favorite Free song) and 'Walk In My Shadow'. These two, as well as 'Blue and Evil' are my favorite performances on the set.
B0091REZMW|3.0|still like most games on here if you want to get things or progress faster you have to spend money. which I do not I play until you have to then I stop. but as I said not bad for a free game
B005LAIHYU|3.0|The film plays with an interesting metaphor: Southern plantation society/the American civil war and vampirism. The American civil war context fits well with the parameters of the Bram Stoker fantasy. A degenerate aristocracy who are \\"dead\\" maintain themselves off the living and create a system that cannot co-exist with a different one. There is alot in that idea that a good writer could mine out. But this isn't that kind of film. This film strictly plays it for exploitation value. Its a fairly stupid by the numbers action film that doesn't think much about anything.<br /><br />The acting isn't bad. The sets and the period settings are better than I had any right to expect. But the writing is third-rate and the action scenes seem to be channeling \\"the matrix\\". Everyone is super-powered because apparently people become super-powered just through will. They also introduce silver metal (ala werewolves) as the kryptonite of the vampire set which is also kind of different. The only interesting thing from an action point of view is that this is the ultimate film about axe fighting.<br /><br />For all its flaws, the film somewhat ends up better than it has any right to be. Its watchable. Beyond that, as absurd as everything is, everyone involved still seems to treat the material seriously (which is good). Its not a conventional horror film by any means. Its more along the lines of a heroic epic where the everyman rises up against injustice to change things. There is no better historical figure for that sort of tale than a Lincoln. And Lincoln did fight a long battle against monsters. Though of the human kind rather than the fantasy kind.
B0067TGSOK|5.0|I purchased the book for ideas but was amazed to also find the real life experiences of various entrepreneurs very encouraging. This book should also be listed under motivational readings as well. All in all, it was informative and well written with a lot of hands on practical knowledge one can apply in their business.
B007GCY8FS|3.0|I've read and enjoyed all of the Jack Reacher books and look forward to the next one. Why only three stars for this one?  Because there is so little action.  While entertaining, you have to read 80% of the book before Reacher really does anything.  Not good for what I've always considered to be an action hero type series of books.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|The perfect blend of a hidden object game and escape the room type game. The puzzles weren't overly difficult but were still somewhat challenging.  My one gripe was there there was too much back and forth all across the map.  It would be great if I got the object I needed someewhere other than the furthest location from where I was going to use it.  All in all, I was really happy with the game play though.  I'm eagerly awaiting the sequal.
B0058W74UY|1.0|I downloaded this app hoping it would help me view a video clip but it was totally useless for me.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|A great book in the series.  Does a great job of trying both Greek and Roman Gods and sides!!  Loved to read it and can't wait to read it to my school kids and personal kids!!
B0083GOVLW|5.0|I'm in a class where we must read a book, and watch the movie adaptation. This by far was the best one so far. The people giving negative reviews obviously didn't read the book first. This movie is so good, and really gives you the insight of Marjane's real life troubles, and you understand that our look ( influenced by the government)  of ALL Iranian people isn't true. This movie truly changed my outlook on people, and not to judge them. :D
B008673ZAQ|5.0|This book had me on an emotional roller-coaster.  Day has a way of making the reader think they know what's going to happen, but then the opposite occurs or what was supposed to be a big deal is brushed under the rug. I enjoyed reading this book, as emotional as it was, because I find that the Crossfire Novels inspire my art.  If this book were a painting it would be a Turner.
B007XKEY6Q|4.0|it was a awesome game / app in all but after awhile it stopped working and it wouldn't open. I am angery because it still wont.
B0063IH60K|2.0|I know people sell the free version with ads so they can make money nut this is crazy. too many ads Anne I hats that we need a twenty word minimum
B0083SBJXS|5.0|Loved it It's a fun movie and if you have been keeping up with all the super hereos, you will love it too.  Can't wait for the next one.
B0086DBE62|5.0|My husband and I both watched this together and we both enjoyed it.  I think teens and older elementary kids would enjoy it as well.  It is fun to see Julia Roberts cast as the villain and she always does a great job of any role she plays.  I recommend it for anyone of any age.
B005B0QYMM|5.0|Was looking for a movie that was more suspense than gore... This was it! Totally enjoyed! Perfect for Halloween! Awesome!
B0047WJ12K|4.0|They say you get bored with something not when you know it completely, but when you can bracket all the possibilities. This was a good action-oriented movie that made me think, but I was hoping for that last little oomph that pushes something over into water-cooler talk land. Just a tad shy.
B006BGZJJ4|4.0|This cable was a replacement for a cable that broke, and it works fine.  In a pinch, you can try to use the charger cable from your phone as mine was commpatable.
B007JOM0GC|5.0|So many of my favorite songs in one place... Awesome!  I don't have to wait from them to be played on the radio to listen to them.
B004AUHWLQ|5.0|What more can I say. Who knew<br />Two of my favorite actors. When they get together they just sizzle. Very funny.
B004J4WLB4|5.0|This was a great book. I read it all in one weekend because I could not put it down. Not only are you introduced to the meanings of flowers, but you are introduced to unusual characters that can challenge your point of view on the world. Highly recommend this book to all of my friends and family.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|this game is so much fun. I love temple run and when I saw this game and read the reveiws; I knew I would love it
B00992CF6W|5.0|so there is no way of saying this innmy words lets put it this way it MORE THAN AWESOME {&bull;_&bull;}
B008AK8FHM|4.0|I like it, its quite well written with two story lines (real life and NDE). Though there are some left unanswered questions, and he doesnt<br />go very much into detail about his experience. Besides that it sounds very true to me, having read surely over 1000 NDE´s so far. I also think<br />it comes at a fair price.
B004T2QZL8|5.0|Good game..hours of fun..favorite element is fun..have fun with this app.  Doodle Devil rocks too.  Five stars for sure.  High five all who contributed to this game.
B005UBNKWO|5.0|For the money, this is a tough processor to beat. Performs well and is durable. Have not overclocked, but I have not need to. Performs well and is stable. Not sure why people waste money on Intel products. It is like the pressure to wear name brand clothing. It is probably not any better, but it has the fancy emblem. AMD haters are all over, if you listen to them, you are going to waste a lot of money over the years.
0756407125|5.0|This review is not meant to dissect Pat's work into tiny bits and explain how I feel about each part. I love reviews like that, sure, but this isn't one of them. Instead, think of my review as a praise, dedicated to one of my favorite works. As an aspiring author myself, there are quite a few things I look for in a book before I go the distance and actually pick it up off the shelf. First and foremost, what is the author's writing style? How does this person communicate the message in his/her heart and mind, weaving a world filled with fantastical elements that will both captivate me, and utterly blow my mind away?<br /><br />So, let's start with communication. Pat has an eloquent writing style capable of taking one by the hand, leading them through the sinuous, earthy passageways of knowledge he's created in his world, and then delivering you in a satisfying and simply aesthetically pleasing position. Now, be aware that I play devil's advocate in my own mind when it comes to even the best works I delight in, and I'm left with naught but the highest of praise for this author's phenomenal ability to tell a story, simply through the unique style that is his own.<br /><br />That leads me to the second point, story-telling. Pat has created an interesting world. A realistic world based in the context of fiction, and then that context is complimented by the existence of practical magic. If I let myself go and indulge in the many details, this review will be twice the size. I should mention, it's clear Pat is quite the alchemist, and Kvothe is probably just like him in many regards, yet profoundly different in many others (what main character who shares traits with his/her 'architect' isn't? Mine certainly is...)<br /><br />My third point is the character base. Kvothe has an intriguing personality. He's arrogant, yet polite. He's confidant, yet untrained with women (I'm not mentioning the Felurian right now... that's a point of its own). He's got an incredibly quick-wit, yet manages to get himself into countless forms of trouble. And of course, he's an excellent musician. I've experienced, on several levels with Kvothe's personality, that he seems almost too 'good'. Too well-versed in all of life's very important traits. But I came to be forgiving and accepting of that. Not only does it personify who Kvothe is, it defines his world, and how he interacts with it. It also gives us an opportunity to explore that world in a very exciting way, because our main man is, himself, as exciting as the world he lives in.<br /><br />I would like to mention the subtle message behind this, which I've noticed. Pat has, without a doubt, taken the classic concept of what a 'hero' is supposed to be, and then created a character who's life satirizes that classic concept. In other words, Kvothe is a hero in tale, but what is the truth beneath the mask? I believe that is one of the biggest concepts Pat wanted to tackle in his book. What is a hero? And, what does it mean to be one?<br /><br />Every review needs an epic twist, so here it is. Now I introduce... the Felurian bit! Kvothe's lustful, coming-of-age-with-women (I wouldn't be surprised if such a thing actually existed) event. I honestly found myself blown away by the sex part. The whole aspect of entering the Fae was cool. I think the other reviews capture how I feel about this part, and seeing as it's Pat, I won't attempt to demolish what he tried to do. You learn to trust an author after having spent enough time in their world. When they do it right for the larger majority of the time, like 85%, you realize that trust is not misplaced. I give him the benefit of the doubt with this bit, even if it ate at me a little bit...<br /><br />So cheers, Kingkiller Chronicle, Day Two. The things that bothered me about this book could not overshadow my opinion of Pat's work of art, even by the instance of a single star. So, five it is. I'm eagerly looking forward to book three!et manages to get himself into countless forms of trouble. And of course, he's an excellent musician. I've experienced, on several levels with Kvothe's personality, that he seems almost too 'good'. Too well-versed in all of life's very important traits. But I came to be forgiving and accepting of that. Not only does it personify who Kvothe is, it defines his world, and how he interacts with it.

And, what does it mean to be one?<br /><br />Every review needs an epic twist, so here it is. Now I introduce... the Felurian bit! Kvothe's lustful, coming-of-age-with-women (I wouldn't be surprised if such a thing actually existed) event. I honestly found myself blown away by the sex part. The whole aspect of entering the Fae was cool. I think the other reviews capture how I feel about this part, and seeing as it's Pat, I won't attempt to demolish what he tried to do. You learn to trust an author after having spent enough time in their world. When they do it right for the larger majority of the time, like 85%, you realize that trust is not misplaced. I give him the benefit of the doubt with this bit, even if it ate at me a little bit...<br /><br />So cheers, Kingkiller Chronicle, Day Two. The things that bothered me about this book could not overshadow my opinion of Pat's work of art, even by the instance of a single star. So, five it is. I'm eagerly looking forward to book three!
0425263916|5.0|This book is EPIC on so many levels!!! I was totally frustrated that I didn't have the time in my life to devote to reading hours on end. Pitiful I know, but who could blame me. I LOVE everything about this series. May can't come soon enough. Sylvia Day has truly outdone herself!!!
B005HEW8S6|3.0|The Voyager alters course to investigate a protostar that is emitting photonic matter that the crew thinks will boost their power generation by 15to 20 percent. They beam aboard two samples for testing and Janeway wants the test results right away. To speed up the testing they try to find Ensign Kim but the computer tells them that he is not on the ship. His last known location was on the holodeck which is acting strangely and the safety controls are not working.<br /><br />Tuvok and Chakotay are sent in to investigate what is wrong and they find the holodeck running a program on Beowulf. While looking for the missing Kim they are told that he was killed by the Grendel. When they confront the Grendel they also disappear from the ship....<br /><br />This is a good story and interesting but it certainly does not carry the kind of action you would find in most Star Trek episodes. This first season is starting slowly and the story line is a strange one. Mission number one is to return back to earth which is 75 years away at top speed and yet every episode they are off course and stopping which will turn the mission into a 150 year journey. They are also having such energy problems that they cannot use the food replicators but they continue to use the holodeck in multiple episodes.<br /><br />I rated this episode a 3 star rating as the story is interesting but there is not really much Sci-Fi involved in this one. It is interesting to watch but don't expect a lot of action. At least the doctor gets a major role in this mission.
1423140605|5.0|OMG!<br />THIS WAS SUCH A FANTASTIC BOOK. I REALLY LOVED THE UNIQUE TWIST. ITS DIFFERENT FROM THE OTHER BOOKS, AND PROBLEMS ARE SOLVED IN A VERY CLEVER AND DIFFERENT STYLE. THERE'S MORE ROMANCE ;-) BUT THERES STILL A GREAT PLOT, ACTION(THOUGH LESS THAN THE PREVIOUS BOOKS DUE TO A NEW SPIN ON THINGS). THERE'S MORE THAN ONE MAIN CHARACTER AND ITS COOL TO UNDERSTAND EVERYONES DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVE; THOUGH I ABSOLUTELY LOVE PERCY, IT WAS A NICE SPIN-OFF. AND YES OH YES THE ENDING WAS LETS JUST SAY INTERESTING (TO BE IN ITALICS) RIORDAN JUST LOVES TO KILL US WITH CLIFFHANGERS IN HIS NEW SERIES MUCH MORE THAN HIS OLDER WORKS. THOUGH NONETHELESS KEEPS US CRAVING FOR THE FOURTH BOOK, WHICH I'M NOT GOING TO REVEAL THE TITLE.<br />AND OMG OMG OMG!!!!!! THIS BOOK WAS BY FAR THE MOST HUMOROUS. IT WAS JUST SOOOO FUNNY. LEO IS HILARIOUS, YOU GOTTA LOVE THAT GUY. I LAUGHED OUT LOUD, AND NO, NOT JUST THOSE LITTLE SMIRKS BUT REAL LIVE LAUGHS THAT COME STRAIGHT FROM YOUR HEART.<br />YOU HAVE MUCH TO LOOK FORWARD TO.<br />GO GREEKS!!!!!<br /><br />:-)
B005LAII9O|5.0|I don't know why some people have been so tuff on this movie. The story was great, the acting was even better and Oliver Stone did a perfect job delivering it all to the audience.
B00846REIS|4.0|If you've come off from just reading the 50 shades of Grey trilogy, you would undoubtedly want to compare this book to 50 shades. i myself did just that and it ruin my reading of the book. you have to read this book with an open mind. i did just that when i approach the second book and realized this was a good book. The book has similar types of characters and where there is this billionaire who starts to fall for a girl her meets in the office building he owns. They both have a dark past and they go through ups and downs in their relationship. I would read the third book when it comes out. I would say to read this book and the second book reflection of you and give it a chance.
B0034G4P80|5.0|The movie was at an excellent price and was a very enjoyable movie and a pre-requisite to \\"The Avengers\\" movie
B004JMY312|5.0|My family all loves this movie.  We were sad when our VCR died and we couldn't watch it as planned.  Amazon to the rescue-we watched it via our Roku through Amazon.com's instant video.  Thanks AMAZON!!!

B009UX2YAC|4.0|Yes, juat like everyone is saying, this game is like Temple Run but with a different theme.<br />I thought the game was really fun to play.<br />If you love playing Temple Run, you'll like this game :)

B008HK3XKO|3.0|I really wish I could give this product the objective review that it deserves. Why? Because it hasn't been shipped after two weeks of waiting. Come on, my Fire needs a cover!
B0099G7KDQ|3.0|I had high hopes for this album after I listened to mumfords single \\"i will wait\\", and on whole it's a good listen... But it just lacks from what I was expecting. It's cliche but, good album, there prior one was better in my opinion...
B009UX2YAC|5.0|this game is kind of like temple run but way way better this game is so awesome I love it.  it is amazingly awesome
B000V8A95C|5.0|I bought this before going to see the show.  It is fabulous!  I'm glad that I can access it anywhere through my Amazon account.
B0097EWK3A|5.0|awesome game cant wait for the nexts one if you like a little mistery this is the game for u couldn't but it down
B0083WLKBA|5.0|I had previously only seen 2 episodes on PBS so in having this set, I was able to &#34;catch up&#34; and get ready for season 3. Excellent show and cast is amazing. This set is a keeper!
B006LSZECO|5.0|Page turner, clever, original and unpredictable.  Didn't love the characters, but found them intriguing.  Very interesting settings, especially the old mall.
B006GLM5EQ|5.0|It was a great season.  I loved every moment.  I would watch it again in a heartbeat.  Grade A+.  Can't stop watching it.
B0088RQ4TI|5.0|I saw this in the theater and thought it was okay.  Watched it again recently and I appreciated it even more!  Great effects, interesting story, great playback on a good home theater!  Watch it again and enjoy!
B000004756|3.0|This album is one of those bills that you would think because of the names of the musicians on it, that it would be impossible to go wrong.  Nothing could be further from the case.  Jam number 1 on The Guitar Trio goes nowhere, and isn't intriguing.  Check out track 1 if you want to see how boring complex guitar work can be.  Jeepers, I never knew people so gifted could play such boring music.<br />In fact, when I first got this one, it was way back in high school and after listening to it, I thought maybe I'd eventually love it, so then I listened to it at college, and it didn't impress me more than a slew of random notes would.  Now, in my 30s I decided to dust it off again and give it another chance, and once again this one only registers a fizzle of excitement.<br />The Guitar Trio's tracks 2, 3, 5, 6, and 7 are okay, but not super special.  Definitely worth listening to, but probably not worth purchasing, as these tracks are only enough to redeem The Guitar Trio album to its 3 star rating.<br />Perhaps, the reason I have been so critical of this album is that there are 3 guitars on it that pretty much all sound alike, such that there is not much diversity of sound.  The 3rd guitarist is superfluous, and adds zero dimension to the music.
B009VW5K12|5.0|Love this show.  Great platack quality.  It's nice that it is so convenient and easily accessebile.  Love this service!  So excited to use it more.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Great read, keeps you up to date as far as history ,characters and how they would live at the time. I'll definetly get the third installment.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|I enjoyed this book very much! I can not wait for the next in the series. Rick Riordan is a brilliant author and I am in love with his works!
B004MYFUC8|5.0|This work brings each character into such clear focus that real- life  names come to mind. Very enjoyable and enjoyable.
B00136RXN2|5.0|This is by far Pink's best album ever! I purchased the cd when it first came out, lost it between several moves and just had to have it again, so I ordered online. I can play this album beginning to end and sing every track. The beats are sick and the lyrics on point. Stop Falling is my favorite track!
B00633W614|4.0|Excellent Archer effort! Fast moving, holds your attention right to the end. I hope the lead into the next book in the series is a promise of a great finale.
B006CHML4I|5.0|I got my first watch about six months ago and I liked it enough. It ran fast and ran down almost daily but I thought this was a symptom of a self winding watch and for the price, just dismissed it. Last week it died all together and Amazon really stepped up! They overnighted and new one; without first requiring I send the old one back. When I got it I simply reused the shipping box and printed/affixed the return label ... a quick trip to the UPS Store and my part was done. Amazing customer service!!! I must have been sent a \\"lemon\\" at first because the replacement keeps great time and has yet to run down. Now I'm really impressed with the watch, especially for the price! I got a couple NATO bands for it and it looks sharp! All around, I'm a very satisfied customer.
B004Y1WCDE|5.0|I am thrilled to be able to report that after reading all the posts in the support threads at the plex website relating to Kindle use, I finally got Plex streaming perfectly to my 1st Gen Kindle Fire!!!! I was so happy with the free Plex server app that I had resigned myself to the $5 android app not working, without even trying for a refund, but eventually I stumbled on the right combination. I had paid $5 for another player, VPlayer with unlock key, which streamed perfectly for me in combination with Skifta (free), but I missed the beautiful interface that Plex offers. It is THE BEST media display interface I have seen, hands down. So hoping against hope, I re-installed Plex on my Kindle, then enabled the experimental silverlight decoder they offer, which didn't work for me at ALL until then, and lo and behold, now Plex works for me with no stuttering. YIPPEE. The channel option made my granddaughter's 7\\" Irulu android tablet stream netflix, too, which wasn't working on that device any other way. All in all, I am a big fan of Plex and can hardly wait to leave town so I can test remote streaming next. Hope this helps someone else with their Fire, and if you have a regular Android tablet, then don't even hesitate to buy this app, because it ROCKS!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|you do the apple always get the good stuff frist not fare finelly kindle got it like jet pack joy ride they got that first to
B007N8RULO|4.0|I like the &quot;Brainium Studios&quot; games. Especially the spider games. it helps me relax before bed and it helps me fall asleep faster.
B005OSUKSA|5.0|David Garrett is absolutely the best. I can't get enough of his music,  When I listen to Legacy I picture a lot of ballet. His arrangements are powerful and relaxing at the same time.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|This is a great app.  I love that you can use music as the alarm instead of an annoying sound.  You can limit the number of snoozes and decrease their span of time after the first snooze.  I use the app as a means of reminding me to do lots of things.  Excellent value.
B001NEK2GE|5.0|This is my second Logitec g13 game board. After the first one broke (6 years of daily use at last 2 hours a day) I found that I couldnt adjust to playing on my keyboard.
B007SGM084|5.0|Very good book. Could not stop reading the three books....I would tell everyone I know even guys to read them..
0525478817|5.0|I'm not one for reading many books but when I do I try to make sure they are well written and wonderful. This book definitely doesn't disappoint! It'll have you laughing and you'll feel like you're travelling along with Hazel on her journey throughout the book. By the end of it you'll be craving more books from John Green. A MUST READ! :)
B007UQ5Z1G|5.0|A gift for my 13 year old son who is huge Linkin Park fan, this cd did not disappoint. Was in condition as described and arrived in timely manner.
1451696191|5.0|This book was amazing from beginning to end and I was very sad to finish it. The great thing though is that I can read it again. Wonderfully written and captivating, you won't be able to put this book down even if you wanted to! :)
B00122LXTM|5.0|Bringing back the 70's and Michael McDonald's smooth voice!  This collection doesn't have a dud in the bunch!  I really enjoyed the whole lot!  I have listened to it over and over again!  And fantastic price!
B008MM9630|3.0|I think it could be better. my opinion is that I don't really like fairy farm.I am more of a Adventist girl. this game is more of a girlish girl game
B009KHDT0C|5.0|My daughter recommended it! My entire family enjoyed it all together! It's great gift for friends and relatives, especially on Halloween! Highly recommended!
B0083GQ2A0|4.0|*The following review contains spoilers. *<br />  This movie is a perfect example of why I never leave until the last credit has rolled.  I always hope for an extra tidbit at the very end.  This movie's \\"tidbit\\" was very important to the final feeling that I came away with.<br />  The film as a whole was good.  It pissed me off a few times because of misrepresentations of the behavior of wolves, but, hey, it's a fictional movie...so...<br />  Liam was brilliant, as always, and the acting of most of the others was also very well done.  Character development was shallow, but I don't think that was the point of the movie.  We knew enough as the movie went along with some extra revelations when Liam was \\"dealing\\" with the wallets towards the end.<br />  While reading some of the other reviews, I got the impression that most people either left the room or turned off the movie before the end of the credits.  Big mistake.
B009AMAMF2|5.0|Went to see this yesterday with my wife and will probably go see it again later this week. It blew my wife's mind and she could not stop asking questions and I must say it made me think as well. To oversimplify this movie would be to say the overall theme in this movie is very much about karma and how the things we do matter beyond our own time.
B008TRUDAS|5.0|Slammed got me hooked right away, I could not stop reading for nothing. I locked my self into my room right when I got home from work and did not put the book down until it was done. Then right away started Point of Retreat. Within 24 hours I finished both books.<br />The first book was devastating to me at the beginning, I wanted their relationship to work so much that it hurt. It was \\"Butterflying\\" good. Having The Avett Brothers songs on each paragraph was awesome. Listening to the songs while reading can't beat that.<br />I will reread this book and Point of retreat over and over again.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|fun and kind of like the old Oregon trail from 20 years ago mixed with a Sims game. the animation is cute also.
B005721W9O|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie, probably because I'm a hardened Star Trek fan.  My only warning would be if you are not a Star Trek devotee you will miss part of the effect.  It should still be funny and enjoyable unless you just don't like science fiction genre at all.  My wife and I used to host Star Trek parties at our apartment as college students when it first appeared on TV (yes, we are that old) so the satire brought back many pleasant memories of good times and old friends.  Many of our discussions played around the same points that Quest makes use of:  Kirk could always find a reason to take his shirt off, never be an unknown crew member on an away mission, some of the uselessly weird gadgetry etc.  Just relax and enjoy.
B0000041TD|5.0|Puccini: La Boheme is a 1973 recording starring Pavarotti and conducted by none other then Von Karajan on this Decca recording. The booklet is quite massive: Besides excellent music notes, it also contains all the lyrics and short biographies of the performers. I thoroughly enjoyed this splendid recording. Highly recommended. 5/5.
1589944607|5.0|I've been playing board, card, and video games a long time.  Board games are still my favorite because of the social aspect; also, my family (both nuclear and extended) has a tradition of getting together on holidays and at other times of the year to play games (mostly of the board variety).<br /><br />Battlestar Galactica (BSG) became my favorite game within a few days after I got it.  I've had it for almost 3 months now, have played it probably 15-20 times, and have had a great experience with family and friends alike every time.<br /><br />My family watched the show together on Netflix over a 3-month period in early 2012, after the show was off the air.  Although knowing the show adds to the experience of playing the game, I've introduced the game to several friends who never watched the show; they enjoyed it immensely.  One friend (who's about 30) recently told me it's now his favorite game too.  These friends come from many different walks of life: I count a furniture store owner, a lawyer, a retiree, and an accountant among those in my BSG play group, ranging in age from about 25 to 80 (admittedly with more in the 40-and-under category, though).<br /><br />The role-playing aspect of the game, whereby each player chooses a character at the beginning (each with strengths, weaknesses, and a once-per-game special ability), helps immerse each player into the experience.  The \\"loyalty\\" aspect, whereby each player is secretly assigned to a team (human or Cylon) at the beginning, adds intrigue and (friendly) tension.  The space battles allow a role for not just the pilots in the game but also the other players, who can use (for example) the Weapons Control location on Galactica to fire the main guns, or the Command location to launch vipers into space (similar to fighter jets being launched from an aircraft carrier).  The \\"titles\\" aspect of the game, whereby one player becomes the President and another the Admiral, gives certain players additional abilities or powersthat add political dynamics to the game experience ... because if you don't like who your President or Admiral is, there are ways to \\"fix\\" that.  There are other dynamics at work to make the game interesting and exciting; the above examples give you an idea of some of the things that are going on in the game.<br /><br />I often explain to new players that the Galactica (the \\"aircraft carrier in space\\" that the game is named after, and where most of the gameplay occurs) is like a wagon train to the stars, and that it's trying to find a new home while the Cylons chase after it to destroy what's left of humanity.  The game is complex but can be taught in a straightforward way.  I recommend hitting the highlights in 10 minutes or less when teaching it, and then just starting the game.  Also, we usually have a new player go last in the turn order so he or she can see other players taking their turns, and to get a better handle on what's going on before having to go through the turn sequence.<br /><br />If the humans can hold out long enough without losing too many resources (fuel, food, population, and morale), without Galactica being boarded and taken over, and without Galactica taking too much damage, then they win.  Otherwise, the Cylons win.  As the game progresses, you make faster-than-light (FTL) jumps to get away from the Cylons (temporarily) and get closer to your new home for humanity.  Halfway through the game, a \\"sleeper phase\\" occurs and everyone gets another loyalty card (or 2, depending on which character you choose) to find out if they are \\"still\\" human or (get this) really were a Cylon all along and didn't even know it.<br /><br />If you like turn-based games, are willing to play something other than mass-marketed \\"store bought\\" games, are up for being challenged by a more complex endeavor, and are patient enough to engage in an intense, immersive experience for about 3 hours, then this game is for you.<br /><br />As thematic board games go, as of this writing it's ranked #7 on BoardGameGeek out of about 500 games of that genre; the game is also ranked #21 out of ALL board games (over 8300 listed) at that same internet site.  Obviously, I'm not the only one who thinks the game is great.  (Of course, not all will agree and for some, this game may not float their boat.  I respect that fact, and encourage you to read the other reviews here at Amazon and take a look at BoardGameGeek to make your own determination.)
B004WCTLNY|5.0|Great movie about free will...God's greatest gift to mankind.  A must see for everyone in this society we live in today.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Absolutely could not put this down and cannot wait for the next book #7. A must read for anyone!!!!<br />Well written and not extremely long for having 5 books in one download. Immeadiately downloaded the next book<br />after finishing this one.
B005LAIGIM|5.0|Do you have problems that are ruining your relationship? If you have a painful childhood and it controls your life each day and every day, get help!
B005IQZB14|5.0|I LOVED this book; it was a very easy read - intense at times.  I had to remind myself this was a true accounting of the author's experience on the Pacific Crest Trail and that made it all the more compelling.  I would highly recommend this book to anyone.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|What a great book and would recommed it to everyone. One my third book now and it is just as exciting as the 1st and 2nd one.
0345803507|5.0|GREAT! Who ever sent it to me said it was GREAT & she was right! I think it was an accurate description of what was sent, but some of the pages were falling out of it!
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|Wow, I couldn't put the book down.  This is not my typical genre.  I thoroughly enjoyed the book.  I think that this is a new genre that I will enjoy.  I can not wait for the final book to come out.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I Love evernote its very easy and convienent if you don't have access to miscrosoft word or just need a quick reminder I use it for almost everything.
B009FZZFME|5.0|I am a huuuge fan of zombie related movies, comic books and everything that has with them to do. :D<br /><br />It is really rare to see a series focused on something else rather than blood, gore and shooting.<br />This is where \\"The Walking Dead\\" shines!!!<br /><br />It is not about the zombies, although they are huge plus if you ask me :D<br /><br />Relations, decisions, sticking together, making the right choices, even the hard ones and at the end not giving up the hope is what this is all about.<br />In situations like these, who doesn't go crazy is not completely insane!<br />Still \\"The Walking Dead\\" balances on a thin tread and excels where many have failed.<br /><br />That is why I love it, recommend it and I think that Amazon should create a \\"1-Click\\" for the rest of the seasons that are yet to come :D<br /><br />Can't wait do see more...
B008TMA1LY|4.0|very cute game and surprisingly a little more challenging than I expected. not for toddlers but maybe elementary/ middle school age kids and up.
1426308469|5.0|I bought this book for my 5 year old cousin. She loves it! She can't read quite yet but based on the illustrations she quickly figured out how to determine whether each animal was a plant or meat eater. She also loved the figures showing how big each animal is compared to a human. When she's old enough to read, she'll enjoy it on a whole new level since there are lots of facts and figures. Definitely recommend this book!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|ok, so they bribed me. just like the title states, it is a decent way to pass the time in the car. still, i would rather do jetpack joyride ( i love that game!!!!!!!!) .
B008M9PHWM|5.0|Dylan has produced an entire new body of work in the last decade.<br /><br />I like it a lot.<br /><br />But, then again, my first record was \\"Bob Dylan\\", which I still play and love.<br /><br />The man is a National treasure.
0316228532|5.0|I think some people will not like to read about the subject matter. It was very real and it made me think. Sometimes we believe that those less fortunate souls are less fortunate by choice.  This is a clear reminder that is not always the case. It shows the day to day difficulties of lower socioeconomic politics and those who are quick to pass judgment upon them. Harry Potter this is not.
B009NPKTN6|2.0|We really wanted to see this in the theater, but it was pulled before we got a chance.  It came to video pretty quickly, so we decided to rent it.  We had high hopes.  They were crushed.  We liked it for the music, but the acting was horrible.  The plot is non-existant.<br /><br />So instead of wasting your time on the movie, just buy the soundtrack.
B00785P2QC|4.0|it is a pretty cool game, just needs to be less obsessive over invest points, thats its major drawback in my opinion. but like i said very cool
B001E75QGG|5.0|I felt compelled to add my voice because I am so sick of cynicism, so tired of all the haters. You didn't enjoy this film? Fine. But does it make sense that both Lucas AND Spielberg have changed? Isn't it more likely your perspective? The original movies, when released, also received terrible reviews by many critics. Imagine how  \\"Temple of Doom\\" would have been received if released during the Internet age? Thank God there was no forum for hate-spewing geeks. Spielberg himself said he liked nothing about Doom, and one critic even went so far as to call the film \\"child abuse\\". But nostalgia makes everything great. It's the same damn effect you get from the Star Wars films. Everything you watched before the age of twelve is flawless, but after you turn thirty, jadedness takes over. Just ask an older person what his favorite movie is; I guarantee you it isn't anything that came out after his/her thirties. Don't compare \\"The Kingdom of the Crystal Skull\\" to other Indy movies; compare them to all the crappy Tomb Raider, Mummy and Pirates of the Caribbean movies (the true successors to Indy). The fourth Indy is much better directed, better acted, and better scripted.<br /><br />People moan and groan about the aliens, even though, in the spirit of pseudo-archaeology, it makes perfect sense. Haven't these 1-Star people ever seen the History Channel? Specials about aliens building the Pyramids are all over the place. In fact, when you consider the very real Nazca lines mentioned in the film (mile-long images that can only be seen from space or high up in the sky) you're forced to wonder whether aliens really did visit South America. Even the concept of a crystal skull and the lost city of El Dorado is rooted in the same kind of pseudo-history that inspired the Ark, the Sankara Stones and the Holy Grail. Oh, but the 1-Star haters say the fourth Indy is too different. Why are there no Nazis? Why does Indy have to have a son or get married? I remember the same complaints aboutDoom. It was too different, they said, too dark, not for kiddies, there were no Nazis in it, no real archaeological discovery, and racist towards Indians (especially their cuisine). While the Ark of the Covenant was a well known Biblical artifact, the Sankara Stones in Doom were virtually unknown.<br /><br />Then there's the \\"Nukin' the Fridge\\" scene, often compared to \\"Jumpin' the Shark\\" from Happy Days (of all things). Of course, the problem with Jumpin the Shark wasn't that it was unrealistic (Happy Days never was) it's that it wasn't true to the tone and theme of the 50's inspired show. Surviving what should seem improbable is classic Indy, and no more unlikely than falling out of a plane IN A RAFT without even a broken bone. And yeah, they used CGI, but people act as if Lucas and Spielberg wouldn't have done so if available to them in the 80's. The first three films used every trick in the cinematic book, including miniatures and matte-paintings, yet nobody complains that Pankot Palace looked fake or that many of the backgrounds (raft sliding down the mountain/mine cart scene) are obviously green-screened. CGI is just another tool in the filmmakers toolbox, get used to it.<br /><br />No, Crystal Skull will not make you feel as if you've just been raped, or even as if Indy was raped (see South Park). It's everything it's meant to be: a fun adventure with plenty of laughs. Leave your old cynical side at home and try to remember why you enjoyed these kinds of movies in the first place, OK?
B002RI9ORI|5.0|Great point of reference in case you ever get into a conversation with an advocate of homeopathic medicine, or an 'antivaxxer', or any one of those other quacks who seem to crop up with depressingly increasing frequency.<br /><br />We live in an age of information - you can look anything you want up in a split second. This is mainly a good thing, but a side effect is that it allows for the dissemination of huge amounts of bulls**t, masquerading as 'fact'. This book is a great antidote - read it, it's very important!
0316228532|1.0|I pre-ordered \\"The Casual Vacancy\\" as soon as it was available on Amazon and could not wait to receive my copy.  J.K. Rowling absolutely enthralled me with the \\"Harry Potter\\" series; I've read them over and over.  The characters in that series are multi-layered and each has SOME redeeming point of character some where, or, are all bad and you loather them, as with Voldemort.  Not true with \\"The Casual Vacancy.\\" All are about as boring as you can get.<br /><br />I really wanted to like this book BECAUSE of the author and it was for that reason alone that I stuck with it to the bitter end and it is bitter.  There are so many characters introduced in the early pages and none well-rounded enough to be memorable that I had to keep going back in the book to remember who was who and what part they were playing in the story.  I'm an Anglophile and love all things British.  Had this been my first introduction to Britain, I would have stayed away. No one, except the character who dies in the early pages, seems to have any redeeming qualities.  It's a depressing book that I had to MAKE myself pick up and read.  I wanted to finish BECAUSE it was J.K. Rowling and there HAD to be something good in here somewhere.  Not so much.<br /><br />I will have to say the descriptions of the conditions of The Fields, the public housing area center in this book, was very well written.  You feel as though you are there, can smell the depravity, see it, and wish you could help \\"fix it.\\"  But, while you can picture the characters, you never get a sense for who they are other than small, petty-minded, even mean people.  The characters are flat, one-dimensional. Only one person was I rooting for even the slightest but you knew nothing good was going to happen for her. I wanted one good thing to happen and maybe that's why I didn't like it; NOTHING good happens. It is truly a depressing book.  If there was comedy in it, I failed to find even a hint of it.  Without spoiling the ending, the ending came so abruptly and the book was over before you had time to come to terms with HOW it ended; I guess I feel the book itself needed closure. The story plods along, and plods along, to this very climatic ending and stops.<br /><br />The only comparison I allowed myself of this book and the \\"Harry Potter\\" series was that in the Potter series, by about the third page, I was hooked and could NOT put the book down.  In \\"The Casual Vacancy,\\" after the first chapter, I wondered why I kept picking this one up.  It was morbid curiosity; I was hoping it would get better.  It did not.
1444729721|3.0|Like so many other people on this thread, I remember being completely riveted by Grisham novels. His last few books, however, have been pretty dull and predictable, and this is no exception. I never learn - I just keep buying them!<br /><br />The story (small time lawyer takes on huge corporation) has been done to death. The plot is over simplistic, resulting in what seems like loads of inane padding.
B007IXWKUK|3.0|I did not enjoy this book until the end because that is when it became exciting. The rest of the book was repetitive. I grew tired of the sex scenes and bored of the dialogue between the main characters, constantly stating their undying love for one another (GAG) we get it already!!!!
B004J4WKTW|3.0|This book was just ok for me- It dragged on and I found myself scanning pages just to get thru some pages- the  characters were underdeveloped!
B009UX2YAC|4.0|this game is pretty fun and awesome except for the fact that its just a copy of temple run in a different scene. its way harder though!! i think so anyways. it is pretty funny when u get hit by a train also. i would recomend this game to someone who is good at quick reactions and liked temple run like i did. i like temple run better though.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Loved this novel! I cried and I laughed, once on two adjoining pages. A wonderful story that I will share with my daughter. Sort of feel like returning to Amsterdam. Amazing and will read over and over again...
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game is what I spend the majority of my on, besides facebook. love it! I'm addicted! does any one else feel this way?
B0032UYFA6|5.0|If you are a fan of this series - and if you watch just one episode you will be hooked - this is a must-have so you can watch and stop action and go back and forth! LOVE Breaking Bad!!
B00932HEX2|5.0|Both me and my husband love this show. It is so well written and the acting is great! Highly recommend watching.
B001H1SVO8|5.0|I have enjoyed watching this movie many times and it never gets old! It has a dry and somewhat raunchy humor to it so if your aren't into that type of comedy then this movie probably isn't for you. Everyone else... Enjoy!
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|The discs arrived quickly and unscratched (within 5 days).<br />We have watched the blu ray five times in the last week and the dvd once (parents do not own blu ray player yet).<br />Unusual disc storage. There are four discs (Blu Ray, Blu Ray 3D, DVD, Digital Copy) and the discs are stacked on top of each other on either side of the inside case instead of a sleeve that flips like a page inside the case to hold the extra discs.<br />Nothing was scratched though, so I guess it works.
B0084IHVGG|5.0|Great for cat lovers!<br />It's a great family movie, focusing on love, loyalty, friendship and strength.<br />Has a very good jazz soundtrack!<br />Two thumbs up.
B0021L8V1Q|5.0|The disc arrived within five days. It was unscratched and a great deal!<br />I still can not figure why Iron Man 2 cost more than Iron Man 1 (I thought they were both good), but hey! Worth it!
B0070Y46UY|1.0|Quite graphic in parts, which made for difficult reading. Disappointing after such a promising beginning. I did not find the characters very compelling, and had to force myself through the very disturbing ending.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|this book was amazing.  Chris kyle has provided a great insight to what its like to be a navy seal, and a true patriot.
B004JMY312|5.0|Absolutely adore this movie . This is movie even though im pushing 30 i gotta watch it every Halloween. Even better when u got lil ones .
B000IZ6FLK|2.0|This movie was very dull.  It was one of those movies you only keep watching because you have too much time invested to not see the end.  I don't understand why so many people like this movie.  It reminded me of an artsy indie movie, that only movie snobs like.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I love this game.<br />so much fun I can not believe I am playing something this fun on a tab.<br />this game is the best.
B004G6009U|5.0|This movie has it all--a compelling story, sympathetic and memorable characters, humor, action, romance, great songs, stunning visuals, etc.  It clearly ranks near the top of the greatest Disney movies of all time.  In fact, it rivals the best of the Pixar films for quality.  And the blu-ray transfer is perfect.  Both video and audio are among the best blu-rays I have ever seen.  This is a \\"must see\\" movie.  I highly recommend Tangled for everyone, young or old, male or female.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|I received my Blu-ray in very good condition and I can't stoo watching it. Thanks! This us really getting me excited about the Marvel summer of 2013.
B009GEEMLY|5.0|Awesome movie.  I had high expectations, but thought it may just get put together knowing it will draw an audience.  It was great.  I liked the longer intro of the movie and then packed with action.  I can't wait for II.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|This game is so awesome, great storyline but not too intrusive, excellent graphics, beautiful voice narratives, challenging game play but not too challenging to beat. Well worth the price, I'm glad I bought it!
B000NQRE9Q|5.0|It was everything I expected...it was fun to rewatch them...they seemed as fresh as I remember them...this is an excellent product
B008ASLK8A|5.0|Unlike some other sequels,this story line really kept us interested in the movie.  Robert Downey Jr's personality fit the role perfectly.  If you liked him in Iron Man you will love him here.
B000FCKGPC|3.0|Well done. That was a nice way to write book 4.  I‘m looking forward to book 5.  I‘m sure it won‘t disappoint.
B0086700CM|5.0|That's what my 13-yr-old son said.  He said, \\"I'm so addicted to this game that I play it every time I'm on a trip and I have my kindle with me. It is a verry addicting game and has ryly good graficks.and it has a rly intense feeling to it.you should rlyrly get it I don't even know why you haven't got it yet.go get it now!!!!\\"  As a Dad, I agree!
054537409X|5.0|I put \\"Exceeded Expectations\\" because I ordered the series thinking I was going to get three books and hopefully a cover box that would hold all three. I did standard shipping and the expected delivery date was three weeks. I indeed got all three books and the cover box, but what wasn't shown in the picture or mentioned in the description was the order also came with a Mockingjay pin! Not only did I get to enjoy a great series and now own all three books (same size etc.) but it was an added bonus that they came nearly two weeks earlier than foretold and contained the Mockingjay pin.
B0052AC8C6|4.0|The animation is amazing.  The story line has depth and is genuine.  The only problem for me was how slow the story seemed to move.
B006H5120E|5.0|First of All we all know Titanic is a masterpiece so that saves me the explaining. The 3D adds new light to this already classic, and makes an interesting watch again and again. Highly recommend this as an upgrade to your old version.
B0001L3LUE|2.0|\\"[General Curtis] LeMay said if we'd lost [World War II] we'd all have been prosecuted as war criminals, and I think he's right.  He, and I'd say I, were behaving as war criminals. . . . LeMay recognized that what he was doing would be thought immoral if his side had lost.  Well, what makes it immoral if you lose and not immoral if you win?\\" -- Robert S. McNamara<br /><br />The defendant who accepts responsibility for his crimes is usually accorded some measure of leniency, but McNamara's confession here begs more questions than it answers.  This comes as no surprise to those studying filmed police confessionals, who may hue and cry along rather postmodern lines that \\"confession concerns the confessional situation rather than the act about which a subject confesses.\\"  Indeed, for this very reason our society has applied specific constitutional protections to those undergoing custodial interrogations.  Though prosecutors may occasionally be surprised by the meaning jurors take from a filmed confession, as in the Bernhard Goetz case, in practical terms, postmodern interpretation -- this hyper-conscious attention to / dislocation of context -- can hardly stand in the way: \\"[L]aw may use postmodernism as a tool, but may never embrace it fully.  Because in the final analysis, beyond all theory and beyond all thought and debate, questions and problems, shortcomings and failures, the law must function.  It must work; it must resolve disputes and reach conclusions.\\"<br /><br />LeMay's statement, to reach a proper conclusion, \\"must be taken in the proper context: political leaders, military commanders, and countless others would probably have been tried by Japan and Germany or promptly executed according to their military practice of the time.\\"  LeMay was no doubt aware that these `trials' and executions would have taken place without the due process protections expected by citizens of Western democracies, and at least arguably supplied to the defendants at Nuremberg.  Seenin this light, LeMay was hardly confessing to anything at all, but merely stating the plain fact of Axis totalitarianism.<br /><br />Both the director of The Fog of War, Errol Morris, and his subject, McNamara, overlook (or in the case of Morris, perhaps deliberately disregard) this context in framing LeMay's `confession,' and more than that, McNamara's own.  Though his mea culpa relates to World War II, the impression is unshakeable that the true object of McNamara's guilty conscience lies somewhere in the shadow of Vietnam.  Regarding that later conflict, \\"McNamara's revelation that he was really a closet dove did nothing to rehabilitate his reputation.\\"<br /><br />Doves were no doubt scarce after Pearl Harbor.  By the closing months of World War II, the air war in Europe had left the door open to saturation bombing of civilians by both sides.  Though McNamara did not give the orders, his contribution to the war effort -- in the form of statistical analysis -- may have contributed to the decision to use incendiary bombs from an altitude of five thousand feet against the Japanese.<br /><br />Orchestrated by General Curtis LeMay in the final months of the Pacific campaign, the fire-bombing of Tokyo killed close to one hundred thousand Japanese civilians, causing \\"more deaths in a six-hour period than . . . at any time in the recorded history of warfare[.]\\"  As one description noted: \\"The stench of burning flesh filled the skies two miles above the city.\\"  Yet, despite the magnitude of this event as tragedy, in the context of history and the law of war, LeMay's actions may have been justified by military necessity; even the authors of the book based on Morris's film are forced to admit as much.  Though the raid on Tokyo took place before Okinawa, that battle must have at least confirmed Japan's suicidal intent in the minds of U.S. strategists.  Kamikaze pilots are mentioned in passing as another example of the brutal character of the Pacific war, but stripped mostlyof this context by McNamara's conflated conscience and Morris's unforgiving camera, LeMay's statement is made to seem the confession of a guilty man.<br /><br />In his earlier documentary film, The Thin Blue Line, Morris did capture a legally significant confession -- remarkably tape-recording the interview with consent of the murderer himself, who admitted to the killing of a police officer for which another man was awaiting execution.  Morris's efforts in that case ultimately led to the exoneration of an innocent man.  The Fog of War, however, allows for no such legal catharsis, because McNamara has confessed to a crime that does not exist.  As the following will show, the case against Robert McNamara (and by implication General Curtis LeMay) is more propaganda than proof, more left-wing myth than legal reality.<br /><br />In the context of war crimes, positive law (usually in the form of treaty obligations) is intertwined with customary practice -- the notion that the actions of nations during wartime define what behavior is acceptable under international law.  Prior to World War I, the accepted practice was that any bombardment of civilians was only permissible as an incident to attacking a target out of military necessity.  During World War I, both sides engaged in the indiscriminate bombing of civilians, and justified these attacks as necessary to erode enemy morale.  Though attempts were made during the inter-war years to come to grips with this practice by creating binding positive law to enforce a ban on aerial bombardment of non-combatants, this was ultimately unsuccessful.  On the eve of World War II, though all sides took great pains to advocate against the practice, ultimately there was no clear international law that prohibited saturation bombing of civilian populations during wartime.<br /><br />As W. Hays Parks has noted:  \\"An air planner in any nation in the interwar era as well as during World War II would have had a difficult time determining thelaw governing aerial bombardment.  He would have found it impossible to find clear, well-defined, express language prohibiting or permitting the actions he was contemplating; at best, he would have found considerable disagreement and confusion among scholars.  He would have been unable to find a comprehensive list of objects that legitimately could be considered military objects; and, in particular, he would not have been able to find appropriate language explaining the distinction between combatants and noncombatants in contemporary terms.\\"<br /><br />Parks also notes that, as it is wont to do when the law \\"`lags behind the facts, . . . it is eventually nullified . . . .'\\"  The customary law of nations during the inter-war years was open to an interpretation that would permit bombing of civilian populations as a legitimate targeting of enemy morale.  Prior to the start of World War II, U.S. General Billy Mitchell had predicted that new developments in air power would effectively erase the distinction between combatants and non-combatants during wartime, and it would be difficult to argue that Mitchell's predictions were not borne out.<br /><br />But McNamara overstates his case (against himself no less) when he claims that \\"the human race prior to [the air offensive against the Japanese], and today, has not really grappled with . . . the rules of war[.]\\"  Perhaps he meant to say that the human race has been unsuccessful in its grappling with those rules:  \\"[I]n the fifth century, St. Augustine . . . held that in a war deemed to be `just' all might be legitimately killed.  The fact that all might not be equally involved (and therefore culpable) in war was an irrelevance, and the distinction between the soldier (who fought) and the non-combatant (who did not) had not been seen as significant.\\"<br /><br />Even aerial bombardment has been the attempted object of international treaty-making since at least the turn of the nineteenth century -- thinking of hot air balloons, the Hague Convention of 1899 contemplated a five-year moratorium on the employment of aerial bombardment platforms.  The Hague Convention of 1907 contained language allowing that no \\"undefended\\" towns could be lawfully subject to bombardment \\"by any means.\\"  Though these treaties were not legally binding during either of the two World Wars, the problem has not been a lack of attempted `grappling' as McNamara mistakenly assumes, but rather that in the race between technology and the will to restrain its use, technology won.<br /><br />Ironically enough, and contrary to many cynical imaginings, advancing technology that might bring a swifter end to a conflict may be a moral endeavor in warfare.  As far back as the American Civil War and the Lieber Code of military conduct, the argument has been explicit \\"that the more vigorously wars are pursued, the briefer they will be, and the less humanity will suffer.\\"  In siege warfare, it was long accepted that responsibility for deaths among the civilian population within the defended town rested squarely with the defending commander.  This principle took shape during World War II by implication when both the British and the Germans evacuated \\"non-essential personnel from cities or areas containing military targets[.]\\"<br /><br />The Nuremberg trials ultimately made no effort to redefine these customary rules of war; though \\"[t]he text of the Nuremberg Charter seemingly invited examination of the legality of German aerial tactics[,]\\" ultimately the international tribunal served \\"to legitimize both German and Allied bombings directed at civilian populations by failing to define such acts as war crimes.\\"  The Chief United States Prosecutor at Nuremberg, Colonel Telford Taylor, justified a refusal to bring charges against the Nazis for indiscriminate aerial bombardment:  \\"The ruins of German and Japanese cities were the results not of reprisal but of deliberate policy, and bore witness that aerial bombardment of cities and factories has become a recognized part of modern warfare as carried on by all nations.\\"<br /><br />In the face of this actual practice, non-binding treaties such as the Hague or efforts between the two World Wars become \\"mere humanitarian rhetoric\\" and \\"legal fantasy.\\"  Otto Kranzbuehler, defending Admiral Doenitz at Nuremberg from charges of conducting unrestricted submarine warfare, made this very argument: \\"I in no way wish to prove or even to maintain that the American Admiralty in its U-boat warfare against Japan broke international law.  On the contrary, I am of the opinion that it acted strictly in accordance with international law.\\"  Though Doenitz was convicted, sentence was applied only as to other charges -- a mere \\"technical success\\" according to Col. Taylor -- and a result which seemed to justify \\"the decision . . . to avoid allegations [against other defendants at Nuremberg] arising out of aerial warfare[.]\\"<br /><br />If Nuremberg affirmed the practice of U.S. fire-bombing against the Japanese, current international criminal law should also decline to retroactively criminalize the actions of McNamara and LeMay; the Rome Statute, for example, strictly adheres to the principle of legality and its logical corollaries: \\"[C]ourts may only apply substantive criminal rules that existed at the time of commission of the alleged crime.\\"  In any case, even if protocols or other potential norms established after World War II and the events in question did apply, \\"[t]he U.S. . . . continues to refuse to allow its citizens to be prosecuted by the new International Criminal Court (ICC).\\"  Perhaps some within the international community might argue that the ICC should make a special exception for McNamara and LeMay, but this leaves us with a war of words beyond the scope of the present discussion.<br /><br />Given the scope of his guilty conscience, McNamara might still throw himself on the mercy (or the train tracks) of natural law -- a `court' perhaps a step above Nuremberg.  But if self-defense fits squarely within such a rubric, than by what measure do civilians maintain their innocence in the face of industrial society and total war?  As one commentator noted: \\"The industrial revolution fully integrated civilians into the industrial war-making capability of their nation.\\"  Even during the Middle Ages, emerging complexity had begun to erase the practical distinction between combatants and non-combatants.<br /><br />Aerial drone warfare may reinvigorate this debate, especially the question of whether civilian casualties incident to a drone attack on a combatant are still considered lawful, despite more advanced targeting capabilities.  Whatever the present-day questions, in the case of McNamara, the practical result is certain; by the middle twentieth century and the advent of the nuclear bomb, so far as aerial warfare was concerned, the distinction between combatants and non-combatants was nearly as theoretical as total war itself.<br /><br />[Please note that footnotes and citations have been removed from this edited version of my own short paper, but are kept on record in my personal collection.]
B008NEMPTO|4.0|The story is self explanatory with the title of the movie. My only real complaint was that the 3D was not as good as I have seen in other movies. Definetely a unique addition to your library, and in interesting movie. I felt before watching this movie it was going to be cheesy, but the tone of this movie is serious, which for this movie works really well. Only lost one star because I felt the 3D could have been better.
B009B50QOU|1.0|I used to like Green Day; \\"American Idiot\\" was brilliant. But I wasn't impressed with this album, and quite frankly, I don't think I'll even sample the next two in this series. I don't think the record execs helped by releasing \\"Oh Love\\" as the first single off of Uno! to the rock radio stations. Although, there really isn't anything much harder, or more punk, on the entire CD. If you're not a die-hard Green Day fan, I would skip this one, and think long and hard about the next two as well. I wonder, in light of Billy Joe's recent trip to rehab, if perhaps he hadn't only lost his edge, but had numbed it/dumbed it down with whatever substance he's trying to quit. I hate to go there, but after listening to the whole CD, I feel entitled. This CD sucks!
B004JMY312|5.0|This is an absolute must when it comes to family Halloween classics.  With just the just the right amount of \\"spook,\\" and tons of humor, this is wonderful movie...perfect for ages 6 and up.  Years ago, my children watched it...and this year, my daughter called me from college to report that she had settled in to watch it in her dorm room.  It's one of those fun movies that becomes a seasonal tradition.
B004J4WKTW|3.0|Some parts confused me, but I was really intrigued overall.  The premise kept my attention but the ending didn't have as great an impact as I was hoping for.
B005GFPZYK|4.0|Chris Kyle seems like the ideal Seal,  die hard about his commitment to the United States. Sworn to protect from all those wishing to do harm to the USA and it's people.  Good read,  great perspective of course.
B007SGLZP8|2.0|I used to love to read Grisham, got disappointed after reading a few then stopped reading him until this novel. I have to say that it left me flat. It was really hard to like or dislike any character, and I did not feel that I ever got to know or truly understand the protagonist. The plot was not ever believable; after finishing it, it just felt like I had wasted my time and money. There are much better novel/ novelists out there.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Once I started reading I could not put this book down. All three books are excellent reading material, could not wait to see what happens next.
B0043RSJ8G|3.0|I read this book for our bookclub. Although I found most of the characters likable the story line was like being in a fun house. Each room held something else. There were too many deep subjects to cover them effectively. The two Mommy parents thing, the frozen embryo debate, and the teenage suicide issue. All of the intense action taking place in a span of six months is a little unbelievable as well. I wish the story lines were fewer and deeper. .....And Max was a whining, spineless, excuse of a man.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I loved this book 1-5. It's well written we all know at least one evil IT peson. I was a little disappointed in the ending and hope there will be another book.
B003YL4L0W|4.0|So many topics in this book ---gays, invitro fertilization, what to do with frozen embryo, religion ---- you name it. As usual Jodi has covered everything pretty well. We discussed this in our book club and gave it a 7 out of 10 rating. Good story with a little twist at the end.

B008CFN95I|4.0|An intriguing premise. A story that cleverly and slowly unwinds. Various threads and themes to spread that story across. A blend of facts, factions and in-betweens. A cast of interesting characters but somewhat lacking in depth and detail. Hints of an impending grand denouement - and then a fizzle. Really enjoyed 9/10ths of the book but felt like the ending just dribbled away, leaving this reader feeling like he'd been sold short.  That said, would certainly entertain Mr Sloan's next book.

0385535147|5.0|THE RACKETEER is a truly engaging novel which pulls you in from the very beginning. The protagonist, Malcolm Bannister, is brilliant if not very likable and is always a step ahead of the FBI, captivating the reader who marvels at his success in calling all the legal shots. This novel is a page-turner and keeps the reader on the edge of his chair trying to figure out what's behind Malcolm Bannister's motivation to confuse law enforcement like he does. Grisham is superb at developing his characters in this story and it is easy to imagine what they look and sound like as they respond to and interact with each other. This novel is packed with mystery and intrigue and the reader is awed by Malcolm Bannister's ability to manipulate law enforcement to his own advantage. I give this book five stars for keeping me in a state of suspense for 340 pages--that's what I call a great legal thriller.
0316212377|5.0|Iain M. Banks writes science fiction set in his Culture universe. The Culture is a galaxy-spanning society of multi-species humanoids and Minds, artificial intelligences that are all too human. Banks has envisioned what he calls a \\"post-scarcity\\" society, so technologically advanced that there is no money, little traditional economy, and everyone has pretty much anything they want. Refreshingly, the Culture is not earthlings; in fact, in an earlier short story, the Culture made brief contact with Earth and decided to pretty much leave Earth to itself for now.<br /><br />While immensely powerful, the Culture has its rivals, and is surrounded by a number of other, less advanced species. The informal, loosely structured government of the Culture has a division that deals with those other species: Contact. And where those other species present a threat to the Culture, or are so outrageous as to offend the Culture's loose norms, then there's a part of Contact that isn't bound by Contact's usual moral strictures: Special Circumstances. Most of Banks' novels involve Special Circumstances, even if it isn't always obvious. Even if Special Circumstances' meddling doesn't always work out for the best.<br /><br />Part of the fun of Culture stories is the ironic, self-mocking tone of the Culture. Many of the artificial intelligences - Minds - are space ships. And the ships give themselves names like Attitude Adjuster, Frank Exchange of Views, Serious Callers Only, Not Invented Here and a principle character of The Hydrogen Sonata, Mistake Not... Which turns out to be a shortened version of a much longer name: Mistake Not My Current State Of Joshing Gentle Peevishness For The Awesome And Terrible Majesty Of The Towering Seas Of Ire That Are Themselves The Milquetoast Shallows Fringing My Vast Oceans Of Wrath. And that reveal comes at the perfect moment, too.<br /><br />The Minds - the ships themselves - and the various habitats managed by Minds are among Banks' characters. The challenge for Banks is to effectively and persuasively depict beings that thinks millions of times faster than humans, for whom a millisecond is the equivalent of a human lifetime. And at the same time to keep normal, slow-thinking humans relevant as characters. Through nine novels and one collection of short stories, Banks has done so, always entertainingly and sometimes brilliantly. You have to work to keep up in a Culture novel. But it is worth the effort.<br /><br />Banks isn't afraid to experiment. In [[ASIN:0316030570 Use of Weapons (Culture)]], the two plot lines wrap around each other in tightening spirals to a truly staggering revelation. In [[ASIN:1416583785 Inversions (Culture)]], where the story involves seeing the Culture and Special Circumstances from the other side, Banks slowly and carefully reveals that that the reader is seeing different views of the same story. While The Hydrogen Sonata is a more traditional, linear story, the plot still has its non-traditional moments.<br /><br />Nor is Banks afraid of tackling the Big Issues straight on. In the eerily prescient [[ASIN:031600538X Consider Phlebas (Culture)]], we see one small episode in an intergalactic war between the Culture and Idirians. Idirian society is a theocracy, engaged in a jihad, whose slogan is  \\"Idolatry is worse than carnage.\\" Phelbas was written in 1987. In the later [[ASIN:145162168X Look to Windward (Culture)]], Banks deals seriously with the psychological damage to humans and Minds from such a no-holds-barred war.<br /><br />In [[ASIN:0316212377 The Hydrogen Sonata]], Banks describes a society whose core involves a book of religious prophecy, The Book of Truth, and what happens when that book may have been fraudulent from the start. The disclosure, or threat of disclosure, comes at a critical time for the society.

B009CPJHY4|5.0|This is a wonderful film from the director of \\"Shakespeare in Love.\\"  What's not to like with the likes of Maggie Smith and Dame Judi Dench and Tom Wilkinson?  Dev Patel (from Slumdog Millionaire) stars as well.  Penelope Wilton makes the perfect b**ch you love to hate. Suitable for all ages, but we older folks will be able to especially relate.
1451695187|5.0|As a researcher who has been studying the nature of consciousness and trying to build bridges between the best of science and the best of spirituality for more than 50 years, I was fascinated by Eben Alexander's Proof of Heaven: A Neurosurgeon's Near-Death Experience and Journey Into the Afterlife.<br /><br />One of the ways we get new knowledge and refine our knowledge about the spiritual is by listening closely to and working with the accounts of people who have what I will loosely call \\"spiritual experiences.\\"  In recent decades our culture, e.g., has been strongly affected by previously unheard of familiarity with Near-Death Experiences, NDEs.  When I first began working in psychology 50 years ago, I knew about NDEs because I had read a lot of very esoteric psychical research literature, but aside from knowing that NDEs happened and a few of their characteristics, very little was known by anyone, and the average person had never heard of them.  When Raymond Moody published his Life After Life book on NDEs in 1976 and it hit the bestseller lists (more than 13 million copies sold to 2012!), it resonated with people's spiritual needs, and now there is widespread knowledge about qualities of NDEs.<br /><br />One of the things that most impressed me about people's accounts of their NDEs back then was that people with very different backgrounds and religious beliefs, including people with no formal religious beliefs to speak of, described the qualities of NDEs in a similar way.  But if NDEs were nothing but the distorted functioning of a distressed brain, you would think that, like most hallucinations resulting from brain malfunctions, the content of those hallucinations would be very much affected by a person's life experiences, cultural background, and individual beliefs.  That there was so much commonality immediately made a case that people were telling you about something that might be real in some sense.  By analogy, I have never been to Rome, but accounts I have heard of what Rome looks like by people who claim to have been there show so much commonality that I have high confidence that there really is a place called Rome.<br /><br />From my perspective as a researcher, however, there is a major drawback to collecting more accounts of NDEs today that didn't apply when they were first collected.  Back then, almost everyone who finally came forth with an account noted that they had never heard of such things before they had their own NDE.  Indeed they usually had never talked to anyone about what they had experienced, or had tried to talk to others and been so severely rejected (you must have been hallucinating, that's crazy, the work of the devil, etc., etc.) that they remained silent about it, and so there was very little obvious influence from cultural background or others' opinions creating the similarity in their accounts.  Now there have been so many articles, books, TV specials, etc., about NDEs that when you hear about someone's recent NDE, you have to wonder how much is this an accurate report of something that is \\"real\\" and how much their experience has been colored by all their previous knowledge about what NDEs are supposed to be about.<br /><br />I am particularly concerned with the potentially biasing effects of previous knowledge because a lot of my early research was on hypnosis, and I had it constantly demonstrated in my research that about a quarter or so of the population could have profoundly real-seeming experiences of any arbitrary nature whatsoever suggested to them by a hypnotist.  I doubt that most NDEs are in this category of the purely arbitrary, all a product of suggestion, even the ones occurring today, but even if a major part of what a person experiences is \\"real\\" in the sense of belonging to some reality external to their belief system, still the way they perceive it may be influenced to some unknown degree by the now widespread cultural knowledge of what NDEs are supposed to be about.  Thisdoesn't mean there's no point in studying most people's NDEs, just that we have to be careful about this possible biasing factor.  There's nothing particularly novel about this, of course, people's descriptions of ordinary reality are often biased by what they believe, emotions of the moment, etc.<br /><br />So one way of getting a less biased picture of what NDEs are like might be to simply give more weight to experiences collected in the early days of research, when most accounts were from people who had never heard anything about what NDEs were supposed to be about.  Another way of trying to get beyond such a biasing factor is to study more extreme types of NDEs, NDEs with characteristics that are not all that common or known in our culture, and this is a major reason why I find Doctor Eben Alexander's Proof of Heaven  book of great value.  One of the most common features of NDEs established in the early research, for example, was that at some point the person having the NDE, the NDEr, reaches some kind of \\"border,\\" or \\"barrier,\\" or \\"bridge\\" or \\"gateway,\\" and although they want to go on to what seem even more wonderful heavenly reaches of the experience, they are not allowed to go cross this border or go through this gateway, because if they did, there would be no chance of them returning to physical life.  Sometimes, knowing this, the NDEr chooses to come back to physical life, sometimes he or she is forced to come back to physical life even though they desperately want to go on.<br /><br />What lies beyond this gateway?<br /><br />Doctor Alexander is a neurosurgeon, and he describes a seven days long NDE caused by a usually fatal brain infection that, given our current medical knowledge, we would say totally knocks out all the higher functioning of the brain, everything that makes us conscious human beings.  From the outside medical perspective, he's in a totally unresponsive coma.  Inside, at first he experiences his NDE almost like a vegetative state, with no real thoughts occurring in it, and going on \\"forever,\\" although no ordinary concept of time or duration meant anything to him in that condition.  And yet eventually he rose above this, with assistance that he perceived in a most interesting way  - -  I won't give away this very thought-provoking aspect of the book  - -  and eventually went through a gateway, and reported  an exceptionally profound experience.<br /><br />Because his experience was exceptionally \\"positive,\\" a word that hardly begin to convey its power, as a human being I want to believe that his was a true glimpse of the reality of the universe, that we're all under the care of a loving, alive, intelligent universe, like physician Richard M. Bucke reported in his Cosmic Consciousness experience, described in my The End of Materialism: How Evidence of the Paranormal is Bringing Science and Spirit Together.<br /><br />That's my personal reaction, but as a scientist, I have to bracket that reaction.  That is I don't deny it or suppress it, but I recognize that this is something with strong emotions underlying it and it has a possibility of biasing an otherwise relatively objective attempt of mine to understand the experience.  So as a scholar and scientific investigator of NDEs, I look at the content of Doctor Alexander's experience, in so far as he can convey it, note the similarities and differences between some other reports of profound experiences by different people in different times and places (like the Bucke Cosmic Consciousness experience mentioned above, or the Darkness of God experience reported by John Wren-Lewis reported on my TASTE (The Archives of Scientists' Transcendent Experiences) site (go to [...] Collected Archives, and select account number 0051, The Darkness of God), and  - - -  Here's where I'd like to say I understand it's clearly connected to such-and-such phenomena in ways that are very interesting - - -  but I can't yet say much more than that this is really interesting, andI want us to learn a lot more about this kind of thing!  I know, this is the traditional scientific conclusion to almost all reports, \\"More research is needed,\\" but it's true!  Indeed I would say the implications of NDEs are infinitely more important than 99 percent of what we study in science, so research on NDEs should have an enormous priority in life, but that's not the political reality we live in.  ;-(<br /><br />I also give some extra credence to Doctor Alexander's account because he wasn't a \\"believer,\\" he wasn't heavily invested in some religious belief system that he had a desperate need to prove.  He had a certain, shallow, conventional religiosity from his family background: going to church on Christmas and Easter, otherwise not really giving religion and spirituality any thought.  He had heard of reports of NDEs, but, like too many physicians, who are closed minded rather than scientific about this area, he dismissed them as nothing but the  hallucinations of a malfunctioning brain.  He wouldn't tell a patient they were crazy if they reported unusual experiences to him: in his role as a doctor, as a healer, he would always be nice to them.  But accounts of NDEs were just noise to him, damaged brain hallucinations.  When he had his own NDE, though, that was something else again!<br /><br />So, moving into book review mode, am I recommending Proof of Heaven: A Neurosurgeon's Journey into the Afterlife?  Absolutely!  Who am I recommending it to?  Anyone seriously interested in the meaning of life, and anyone willing to try to bracket their own previous beliefs and preconceptions and be very, very stimulated...real thoughts occurring in it, and going on \\"forever,\\" although no ordinary concept of time or duration meant anything to him in that condition.

B007C3TVNA|1.0|Please do NOT waste your time or money on this movie.  Despite a laudable performance by Swinton, the movie is slow, monotonous, tiresome, devoid of suspense or dramatic tension and a GREAT disappointment vis-a-vis recommendations on the jacket-cover or other Amazon customers.  At the end of this movie, I actually apologized to my wife, my older kids, AND MY TWO DOGS for wasting their time.  It was clear that the movie's producer/directors did not know what to do with the movie, how to narrow it's focus, and how to decide whether it was a slow social commentary or a horror film or a failed suspense film. It failed to accomplish success within any genre, unfortunately.  DO NOT PURCHASE!!
0307951529|2.0|This book disappoints on so many different levels I don't know where to start. Most importantly, the title of the book suggests it is a book about \\"startups\\" and how you can create a successful startup business with minimal investment.<br /><br />What you really get is a very basic business book with a collection of adhoc stories about how others made money with various ventures - from self-publishing to coffee houses.<br /><br />The book provides very little in terms of useful startup content other than perhaps a \\"one-page business plan\\" which is nice for those trying to quickly determine if they may indeed have a viable business idea. There is also a \\"39 step product launch\\" which makes an attempt to highlight important components of a product launch. Again, not extremely thorough, but at least somewhat helpful... just not worth the price of the book.<br /><br />This should have been a $1.99 19-page eBook.<br /><br />There are so many good business and startup sources available for free, online that it is a shame that this book is somehow being manipulated to the top of a best-seller list. Kudos to Crown Business Publishing for figuring out how to game the system and get good buzz for a weak, Tim Ferris-like product.
B004XZR63M|5.0|I have not yet finished this book but am enjoying it thus far.  It has the usual pitfalls of \\"success secrets\\" type of books in that the writing is not great and ideas are repeated numerous times (ostensibly to help drill it into the readers head but perhaps more likely to fill up some pages to make the book seem more significant than it is).  But Kiyosaki is only doing what all the other guys do to sell their titles on becoming wealthy!<br /><br />I am truly the son of poor parents who had minimum paying jobs their entire lives and never understood enough about money to be able to offer any legitimate advice to their offspring.  As such I have wasted too much of my life not building my wealth but rather \\"investing\\" more or less in what Kiyosaki calls liabilities whenever spare money was to be found.<br /><br />I don't know why at this particular time I'm feeling inspired by this particular title - it's likely no better, but certainly no worse than other writers - but I do recommend it especially for those of us who genuinely have no idea how differently those with wealth think and how they view money and wealth. At the ripe old age of 52 I'm hoping it's not too late to begin amassing my wealth!

0739384198|5.0|Picking up where things leave off at the end of book 2, this book continues on to tie up the loose ends that make up Lisbeth Sallander's entire life. Even though the larger arc of this trilogy has already been established in book two, additional plot lines pop up and get resolved in the course of events throughout the entire story.<br /><br />This is a really marvelous series of books, and the third is a wonderful conclusion. There is definitely a perhaps too-tidy resolution that seems to indicate a rather naive sense of justice, but the presentation is so well done, the ultimate conclusion feels natural and organic.<br /><br />The entire story from book one through three matures in the telling, and I am astonished at the sophisticated plot and seemingly effortless storytelling. It's really a shame there won't be more books from Stieg Larsson, but I must say that what I've been able to consume has been absolutely wonderful.<br /><br />As with the other two books in the series, this audiobook was read by Simon Vance, who manages an incredible number of distinct voices for the series. Very well-produced.
B005DN5BE4|5.0|Great movie with all star cast.  Steven Speilberg did a superb job depicting the horrors of slavery - before slaves even reach America. Even better, is how the Constitution of the United States is used as a point of law to grant the black people freedom. Using the law - fighting smart - is emphasized when Matthew McConaughy's character uses Property Law principals to initially win the case for the slaves, and again, when Anthony Hopkins character (John Quincy Adams) uses Constitutional Law to win the appeal to the Supreme Court.  Very effective and informative for high school and above (college) to watch.  Highly reccommended.

1906694141|5.0|The second book in the Millenium trilogy, The Girl Who Played With Fire is a pretty intense follow-up to book one, The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo. It picks up about 2 years after the events of the first book, and really focuses more on Lisbeth as the main character. We're treated to excruciating details about her past and what has shaped her present, but the gory details are spread very smoothly throughout the entire book.<br /><br />Familiar characters are back and play a central part in the main storyline. The only criticism I have about this book is the rather abrupt ending. On the one hand it's refreshing to have the story simply end, without knowing how all the other details play out, but on the other hand, there's a lot of questions in my mind about things they don't wrap up. It felt like there was one more chapter missing.<br /><br />All in all, a gripping, well-written book of intrigue and murder.<br /><br />I listened to the audiobook, which was very well-produced and read by the same reader as book one. He does a fantastic job with individual voices, and thankfully, he's the one who has to pronounce all the Swedish cities and street names. I can only imagine stumbling over each street and city name if I were to read the actual book.<br /><br />I'm looking forward to the third and final book in the series.

0316056871|5.0|I'm not sure what to say about Bossypants, Tina Fey's autobiographical accounting of how she came to be the person she is today. It's not quite a comprehensive memoir; it's not quite her personal showbiz history; it's not quite comical commentary on various aspects of being a girl or woman. It's a little bit of all of those. Unfortunately, there's just not enough of any of it. I don't mean that to sound like it's not a fulfilling or funny book; it's actually laugh-out-loud funny, and I breezed through it pretty quickly.<br /><br />If you're a fan of Tina Fey's geekwit humor, you'll love this book. I laughed out loud at least five times in the first chapter of this book, which is mostly about the intimacies of being a female - something to which I cannot directly relate, but found nevertheless hysterical.<br /><br />I have heard from many sources that the audiobook of this is even better. I hope I get the opportunity to check that out as well, because I'm sure Tina reading her own prose is even funnier than my own brain's attempt to put her voice to the words in my head as I read them.

B004WX6672|5.0|A Christian Critique<br />on John Steinbeck's East of Eden<br />Editorial #28 by Joseph Yosuk Lee<br /><br />John Steinbeck has an interesting view that man is more loving than God Himself. Despite Steinbeck's incorrect view of God, East of Eden is actually based on the book of Genesis from the Bible. The Bible says that God is just and hates sin, but He also values our obedience. This is why Abel obeyed God by offering an appropriate sacrifice. On the other hand, Cain disobeyed God by offering a sacrifice tainted by his depravity, and by murdering his brother Abel. Cain was jealous of God's blessings to Abel, and he was hurt when God rejected him. Steinbeck believes that it seems unfair from his perspective that God blessed Abel for his obedience and rejected Cain for his disobedience.<br /><br />In East of Eden, John Steinbeck portrays Adam Trask as a type of God and Cal and Aron (Adam Trask's sons) as a type of Cain and Abel, respectively. Adam Trask acknowledged Aron, the character representing Abel, because Aron obeyed his father by going to Stanford even though Aron wanted to drop out of college. Later, Cal, the jealous brother, indirectly murdered Aron although Aron was actually killed in World War I. Adam Trask forgave Cal, while God did not forgive Cain. For this reason, John Steinbeck believes that God is far less loving than man.<br /><br />John Steinbeck failed to see that Cain had no remorse for his sin against his brother, while Cal did. Cain never asked God to forgive him, while Cal asked his father to forgive him. Last of all, John Steinbeck failed to see that Adam Trask was a finite and sinful man. Adam Trask did not possess the infinite and eternal characteristics of our holy God. Even if Adam Trask were a perfect and sinless angel from heaven, Adam Trask did not have the infinite power to pay the penalty for Cal's sin. Only Jesus Christ can do that

B007J4T2G8|5.0|I will admit I was hesitant to read these books, but decided I'd try it anyways. I am totally floored! I fell in love with the book by the 4th chapter and finished all 3 books in 5 days. I was up in wee hours of the night because I couldn't put it down. This type of style is not something I am into, but quickly fell into the story line and loved every moment of it. I think the author did an incredible job, and I hate to see others say it's not written well. I love this about the book, it doesn't seem scripted-her thoughts and the stories are something of normalcy. I will also say it certainly spiced up my love life, and made me think about the way I felt and treated my spouse at times. Even though a lot of the things are kinky, the passion behind this man is indescribable, and made we wish my husband and I both felt that way as we did when we were younger. My husband has NEVER read a book in his life past school, and he was impressed with my readings of it and started it a few days ago. He has nearly finished the first book and reads on his phone whenever he has a free moment. I loved it and look forward to the next readings!

I have several of Diana Krall's CDs but I would not consider this one a favorite.  It is very different very rag time ish.  Everyone who is a Diana Krall fan will have to decide if they like it themselves.

B002N44XSG|4.0|Thought that it was a pretty good book overall, but wished less pages had been devoted to maps and images, and more to the stories.  However, there are good stories, and the images are interesting.  Wish it cost less.

B009CPJHY4|4.0|A heartwarming film which quite realistically presents India as a traveler will discover it today. Worth seeing more than once.

B0071XO8RA|4.0|The \\"world within a world\\" concept is nothing new in science fiction... but that's okay -- there are plenty of science fiction tropes that have been done over and over again. What's important is that it not be done to death... that the author find something engaging to add. Hugh Howey has done that with \\"Wool\\" through his excellent characterization across multiple points of view.<br /><br />Structurally, the \\"Wool\\" omnibus edition is rather like Isaac Asimov's \\"Foundation\\" books (or at least the first one) in that it completes a story arc across time and across numerous protagonists. Its the subtle threads connecting each viewpoint character that help add humanity to the tale, so that, unlike \\"Foundation,\\" you actually care about what happens to the characters, not simply what happens next in the plot. Perhaps best still, the protagonists and antagonists are all sympathetic and believable, with deep convictions.
B001EC2ISA|4.0|The film starts out with this cozy victorian home in conneticut, where two really nice people love each other and both want to stay home for their vacation and do all the things they wanted to get done. I like the way they enjoyed the time together, they seemed so happy. They end up dying but in a adventurous way. The little town they lived in was intimate and comfortable. They become ghosts and the neat thing is, is that everybody learns different lessons in the afterlife, I find that exciting. They have a handbook and a little bit of guidance but each person finds their way differently. They end up staying in their house, others come. I like Winona's character, she is creepy and creative. She befriends the ghosts who were intent on making her parents leave. Parents decorate with art deco stuff, a vintage home. Anyways they meet the coolest charcter in the story, Beetlejuice. He acts with such gusto and dark pizzaz. Anyways, I like their adventure, I love the dinner party, the mambo music, the huge shrimp cocktail, the home creativity, the love for the girl by the ghosts, the handbook, the fun and the train village come to life.
B005K01VZS|4.0|Book well written and enlightening as well. I liked the fact that Mitch agreed to do the Eulogy , worked through it and eventually delivered.
B00956UPSW|5.0|This is more bone cruching music from Phil and the gang.  It like there was not a lay off at all.  If you are a fan of Down this is a welcomed addition to your collection.  i highly recommend this album.
B002ZB26AO|3.0|Ms. Demick's book is enlightening, sad, sobering, and unforgettable.  Its main problem is that towards the end it becomes too repetitive; a good editor could have helped with this defect.  The chronology is a little confusing as well.  At that being said, I think it is an important book that should be read by anyone doubting that the North Korean government is beyond repressive and cruel--it is barbaric to its own people,  Since not many people ever get to travel  inside that bitter country, Ms. Demick's perceptions and analyses are invaluable.  Her many interviews with people who have managed to flee North Korea are also interesting and surprising, especially  when it becomes so clear that many of these refugees find it so difficult to get beyond the brainwashing propaganda they have been fed all their lives about South Korea and the rest of the world!<br />A must read!
B006ZCWU5K|5.0|Wrecking Ball is one of Bruce's best recent albums.  It captures the excitement of his live Met Life concerts in September.  I really like it!
0385535147|2.0|I'd have given this disappointment a different title:  THE FIZZLER.  Here I'm refering to the plot, of course, and after you read this baby you might agree.  You just have to wonder what makes a famous author think that with his well-established reputation and name, he can just<br />spin out any load of shtuff and people will gladly pay up for it. Considering the sheer, sleek beauty of novels like THE FIRM, THE CLIENT, THE PELICAN BRIEF, it's nigh impossible to believe that his newest is so poorly executed AND I came to believe that he knew it, as he suggests in his afterword that there was little to no research involved. Big surprise!  The usual buildup to the missing climax is totally stifled by the blah ending. Honestly, you and I have read better comicbooks than this loser. So it's awfully hard to believe the other reviewers who sing such loud praise for a book that disappoints on all fronts.<br /><br />Good grief, Charlie Brown!
B0098VYCCE|4.0|Don't expect a masterpiece, but was fun and visually exciting. The forest scenes and animations were very creative. I was glad I watched it, a good \\"turn off your brain\\" and enjoy kind of movie.
B007MB5OCE|5.0|I read this book in the Italian translation. It is truly funny. It does help to have a knowledge of history for his backstory but the crime narrative which takes place in the present is totally hilarious, so not to be discouraged. I cannot imagine how all of the goings-on can be made into one film.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|There are no words to describe this book, \\"Fifty Shades of Grey Trilogy\\". I'm no prude but ditch this book (trilogy)!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Not worth the money spent on it.
B005HSL626|5.0|Can there b anything else so satisfying as using your finger ojn a small screen to slice fruit as it is tossed?
B007MDB548|3.0|We have all the versions and my kids love them.  This latest one was very cute, but too short and the story didn't really develop, before we knew it, it was over.  Terrance, her \\"best friend\\" wasn't even in the movie, albeit one shot of him at the end. While very cute, we thought it a little disappointing because we wanted more.  The first two are by far much better.
B005LAIHYU|4.0|I kept saying I was going to see this at the movies but I never made it. Right now I am in the DC area riding out Hurricane Sandy. I bought this DVD this afternoon because I love american history and I also like True Blood and the Twilight movies. It seemed like a great idea to ride out a storm with a movie.<br />The truth. This will never go down as a work of art or a great movie, but it is fast moving, has good actors, nice special effects, good photography, lush period sets and costumes, and manages to do a pretty good job of marrying historical fact with fiction, fantasy, and the supernatural. This movie even manages to put Mary Todd Lincoln in a more favorable light while Abe Lincoln hunts down vampires with the finesse of Jean Claude Van Dam while delivering profoundly philosophical messages to a fractured nation.<br />If you have the capacity to suspend logic and go with the flow, you'll enjoy watching Abraham Lincoln keeping the nation free of those pesky vampires and Mary Todd doing more. This is a curious combination of historical fact and pure fantasy with plenty of violence tossed in for good measure.
B004Y6MU6S|5.0|Has to rank in the top epic fantasy books ever written. Many fantasy novels are plodding and take real effort on the readers part to fill things in but not this book.Once things get going I assure you you'll stay up late a few nights because it's so hard to put down. Brandon Sanderson really knows how to write and his imagination and world building abilities are downright astounding and his fight and battle scenes are equally as impressive. Has everything you could want in a book no matter what the genre.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|Great graphics, nice music. Plays well on G SIII. Must have if you like match 3 games!! Not much in replay value tho
B008NEMPTO|3.0|The movie was entertaining and an interesting twist to real life events.  However, do not spend the extra money for the Blu-ray 3D version of this movie.  The 3D was hardly noticeable and somewhat distracting at times.  I wish I would have known this ahead of time.  Stick with the standard Blu-ray (or even DVD) version, sit back and enjoy the movie.<br /><br />Movie = 4 Stars<br />3D Effects = 2 Stars<br />Total = 3 Stars
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I love the follow- up to Bared To You! I really wish we didn't have to wait so long for the last book! Can't wait!
B000ICLRIE|4.0|Riveting! This movie was recommended to me by a friend who is a staunch evangelical so I was expecting to see a lot of Bible speak! Turns out to be an action packed movie presenting us with a glimpse into the genesis of today's religious conflicts.  It lays the foundation for understanding events in contemporary Middle East.  Enjoyed every bit of it.
0451418441|5.0|I have not finished reading it yet. So far, really good.  I have not gotten to know the characters yet, but I will.  Very interesting read.
B000FC12ZA|4.0|This is a fascinating look at the Aboriginal culture from an outsider (mutant) who was briefly allowed into a \\"tribe\\" of natives.  The details of everyday life were so interesting to read about, and although the spiritual aspects might seem far-fetched or strange, I can believe what Ms. Morgan wrote because I have visited Australia myself and experienced a tiny slice of their lives.  Anyone who reads this book will surely gain understanding and appreciation for a group of people that will eventually disappear from our planet.

1451695195|5.0|This is by far the BEST book I have ever read!! Ever! I hope he comes out with a second book or a movie I am completely intrigued!
B0095T3H2U|3.0|Good storyline. A little slow on the development, but overall not a disappointment. Not the best Jason Segel movie I've seen, but still worth watching.
B0014CQNTK|4.0|Great movie & love the sound track. Funny characters & nice story. Juno is a fun movie to watch. The parents are especially funny.
B005MJAQTE|5.0|I love the new Hawaii Five O television series and had not seen several episodes from Season 1, including the premiere, which I am now providing a review for.  It was awesome!  I love the easy comraderie between Alex (Steve) and Scott (Danny).  Daniel Dae Kim and Grace Park also make a great Chin and Kono, respectively.  This episode laid the framework for the series and I'm glad I caught up!
B009AJD5E0|4.0|I like it when movies give you the feeling that you're being taken away to a far away land and you feel like you're there. Ridley Scott did a spectacular job creating the environment for this movie. Photography was awesome and the cast did a great job. The story was well executed. The play on DNA works well in solidifying the clues to the mystery of our origin. The reason I gave it 4/5 is because some parts were a bit far fetched and took me out of the spell of realism. But I won't go into detail because I don't want to spoil the movie. However, the overall movie makes up for these scenes and I believe you'll have an enjoyable experience.
0300169787|5.0|Alexander McQueen was such a wonderful designer. For those of you not able to go to the exhibit, such as myself, this was really great to see more of those collections through beautiful photos. The cover of this book is insane!! You'll love it. I can't wait to place this on my coffee table to thrill my guests.
B0086700CM|5.0|I could definitely play this for at least an hour at a time.  cant recommend it enough...things can be expensive in game, though
B009NQKPUW|5.0|I am not going to be a spoiler alert!!!!<br /><br />If you love the Alien Series this movie will make more since to you. I watched this at my friend's house and it was amazing! It has been truly a long time since I have seen a true genuine space sci fi movie like this. This movie has a lot of twist and turns and will keep you on the edge of your seat and hopefully produce Prometheus 2. The plot and story line was good however was a bit slow at times compared to other space sci fi movies but don't let that stop you from hitting that rent button or even buying it, it was amazing. I really hope they come out with second part of this movie.
B00992CF6W|5.0|mc has caves;mobs;monsters;( and many more cool features)and its not some lame copy of a game like suckish block story.  that game is dumb+it doesn't have villagers!(man I love villagers! )
B008J34466|4.0|\\"The Truth About Love\\" by Pink exposes the sentimental and her naturally edgy side.  The music video for \\"Try\\" was what pulled me into checking out her cd.  \\"Are We All We Are\\", \\"True Love\\", \\"Here Comes The Weekend\\", and \\"Beam Me Up\\" are some of the other catchy songs on this collection.  \\"The Truth About Love\\" by Pink is great for those who enjoyed \\"Sober\\", \\"Perfect\\" and/or \\"Don't Let Me Get Me\\" (due to the tunes being along the same creative wavelength).
B0081BU42O|3.0|I'm sure this will be a nice book, once I get my hands on the print edition. Unortunately, in the Kindle edition, hyphens and dashes look identical, which makes reading this book a chore.
B009NQKPUW|4.0|A welcome return from Ridley Scott to the worlds he created with Alien and Blade Runner. Prometheus plays like a blend of both of these ground-breaking films. The mood is dark like in Alien and the technology is awesome like in Blade Runner. The director's first film in 3D is the only way to see this movie in my opinion, so go for the multi-disc blu-ray set, turn down the lights and enjoy!

B008AX1HD8|1.0|this book was a disaster, i had waited and waited for Joe Nesbos new book and what a disapointment i have decided that someone else must have written the book, it was so bad, i am a big Joe Nesbo fan and this is one book i will not be reccommending to my friends, the story was bad the action was bad what went wrong with him ?
0978545095|5.0|It was simply Ms. Maier's passion for photography that created this wonderful book (Out of the Shadows) for all of us to enjoy. She captured life on the streets.<br />She was simply there....waiting for the moment.....<br />The sad thing about her story is that it took her death to bring her talents to the forefront. And just maybe I never would have appreciated her work as I do if she had lived. She would just have been another photographer.<br /><br />All of her work being left in a storage area and then sold for auction when she never picked them up. A treasure just waiting to be found. And now a treasure to be enjoyed my many - again and again and again.<br /><br />She had an absolutely incredible eye!
B005K0HDGE|4.0|Not your typical King read.  I enjoyed the departure from the norm.  This was a very good book.  The characters were good and the attention to detail was great.
B008XNZMOU|4.0|\\"Red\\" by Taylor Swift continues Taylor Swift's musical journey of love and life.  \\"We Are Never Getting Back Together\\" was an ok song, but I fortunately heard other tunes on this cd that I like more.  The following are some of the other strong songs on her cd: \\"Sad Beautiful Tragic\\", \\"Red\\", \\"I Knew You Were Trouble\\", \\"The Last Time\\", \\"Everything Has Changed\\", \\"The Lucky One\\" and \\"Starlight\\".  This cd is best for those who have liked either \\"Love Story\\" or \\"You Belong With Me\\" (due to the songs being in a similar musical vein).
0517548232|3.0|Henry Hazlitt was a libertarian writer and philosopher from the libertarian perspective. This knowledge is VITAL for understanding the book.<br /><br />The book basically does two things; it brilliantly explains classical economics, and, without directly addressing or outlining his opponent, makes a straw man of Keynesian-ism and knocks it down.<br /><br />So without going into too much detail, let me summarize what i feel is the best approach to this book; Hazlitt summarizes brilliantly the wondrous, beautiful mechanism that we know as the market. It magically sets prices, distributes resources and income, provides trade balances, and leads to peace. But it does this with certain limitations, and draw backs-<br /> It can only do so if<br />  A. externalities are tiny to nonexistent (like environmental effects, and health hazards)<br />  B. Say's law, that \\"supply creates its own demand\\"(Keynes) holds, which there is very clear evidence it doesn't always do (i.e. the great depression)<br />  C. And if we are satisfied with the Distribution of income (think of the factories of the industrial revolution, and the needless luxury of the Victorian age)<br /><br />In summary, don't make this your intro to economics, but use it as a helpful summary of market theory.<br /><br />for a better intro to economics, besides just getting a textbook, i recommend<br /><br />[[ASIN:0393337642 Naked Economics: Undressing the Dismal Science (Fully Revised and Updated)]]<br /><br />[[ASIN:0756698278 The Economics Book]]
B007IXWL2C|1.0|While Trilogy's enrich the publishers and authors, most lack enough story line to be worthy of that many words. They certainly don't enrich the reading experience. The \\"Fifty Shades Trilogy\\" was no exception. The plot, what little there was of it, was weak. Christian had sexual prowess that doesn't exist on the planet and Anna was just not believable.<br /><br />The author clearly ran out of ways to describe their way too many sexual encounters and resorted to simply repeating her previous descriptions. Quite uncreative. I surely hope this is her last book as she does not deserve another chance.<br /><br />By the way, I am a man and enjoy a good love love story, but this was ridiculous. I stuck with it to the end. I don't know why, other than to able to be credible when I write this review.
B000IKAHN2|5.0|I got started on Stargate SG-1 a couple years ago.  Though the early seasons were very cheesy, the cast and universe the show created really grew on me.  By the later seasons of the show they had refined their formula to something fun and humorous, yet satisfying on a much deeper level as well.<br /><br />Stargate Atlantis is a continuation of this Universe. A new galaxy, a new cast, and new threats; with regular cameos by some familiar faces. This show is a must watch for any sci-fi fans.

B009AMAM9S|5.0|\\"Cloud Atlas\\" was a great and unique film that creatively weaved concepts of reincarnation into a message of how we are connected to one another.  I am thankful for all of the blessings that I have in my life (including my family members and friends).  However, watching this movie reminded me why I would prefer for my current lifetime to be my last lifetime on earth (if reincarnation actually exists). Yes, I know that \\"Cloud Atlas\\" is only a great entertainment movie.  It is just that some of the future scenarios that were depicted were quite dramatic and definitely different from my vision of a future Utopian society.<br /><br />For example, Tom Hanks and Halle Berry cleverly play the powerful roles of two spirits who become drawn together in both 1970's California and in some post Apocalypse world of the future.  The world definitely requires physical aggression and definitely falls under the phrase \\"survival of the fittest.\\" There is also a heartwarming story of a man who undergoes psychological changes when a runaway slave befriends him.  This somehow seems to tie into a future life reality in Asia.  There were more actors and actresses that did a great job with the interwoven past and future life stories crafted together.  It is just that some of the realities turn out wonderful while it is a matter of personal perception on how the others unfold.  Aside from my personal perspectives of caveats, \\"Cloud Atlas\\" is a film for those who enjoy movies with spiritual themes and/or high adrenaline action.  Due to some graphic and violent scenes, care must be obviously given when bringing any children under 12.

B008V59AFW|5.0|\\"So\\" by Peter Gabriel is a quality three cd set that features nine of his classic hits on cd one.  Cd2 and Cd3 are both recorded from the Live in Athens (1987) event.  What enhances my enjoyment of this collection is that I had recently been to a live concert of his that brilliantly covered the tracks on \\"So\\".  \\"Sledgehammer\\", \\"Don't Give Up\\", \\"Big Time\\", \\"In Your Eyes\\", \\"Solsbury Hill\\" and \\"Games Without Frontiers\\" are some of the multiple music gems that are covered on this cd. \\"So\\" by Peter Gabriel is best for those who like late 80's and/or 90's music with important social and/or political themes.
B00004STDN|4.0|This is one of those movies that you kinda make fun of but you watch every time it's on TBS. Lots of unnecessary foul language, posturing and gross overacting but still entertaining. If you're in for a cheesy but entertaining action flick, you will not be disappointed. Not sure why Lithgow affects a pseudo-British accent; maybe for a feel of international intrigue. Michael Rooker cracked me up!
B000O77SRC|5.0|\\"Die Hard\\" (1988) is excellent because it is not complicated...and the music is very good, too.<br /><br />The entire story, with only a few cutaways lasting a total of 5 minutes for the entire movie, takes place in one, easy to understand location.<br /><br />The script is simple, and characters are not given jokes and speeches they can't handle and which slow the movie down. The first two Die Hard movies are different in that way. The second Die Hard movie is filled with script speeches and add-on jokes and wise cracks which don't work, and the first Die Hard movie is not burdened with script writing which tries too hard.<br /><br />The use of the Beethoven \\"Ode To Joy\\" theme from the Ninth Symphony is used very interestingly and very well, and is included in an orchestral version during the closing credits.<br /><br />The same end of the movie presentation of classical music was done for Die Hard Two when \\"Finlandia\\" is played in its entirety during the final credits.<br /><br />Die Hard (1988) is presented as a relatively simple combat situation between the main villain (Alan Rickman) and the main hero (Bruce Willis), and other characters are not given as much \\"center stage spotlight\\" time and importance as they are in Die Hard Two. Die Hard One is better for that reason.<br /><br />Most hit movies which spawn follow up movies are not as good in follow up versions and variations. This is true with Die Hard One, the best of the Die Hard series.<br /><br />Movie making is always a committee event, and the old adage which states \\"a camel is a horse put together by a committee\\" applies to movies and explains in part why so very few movies are truly excellent.<br /><br />The making of follow up movies is especially a problem for the \\"committee style\\" which dominates most movies.<br /><br />Die Hard (1988) is a good movie because it is simple, easy to follow, and not complicated by attempts to \\"improve it.\\"<br /><br />---------------<br /><br />Written by Tex Allen, SAG Actor.AG Actor.

B00407PNY2|5.0|\\"Bullitt\\" (1968) starring Steve McQueen....why it's a great movie and a few words about the history of it's 1968 premiere in SF CA USA.<br /><br />\\"Bullitt\\" (1968) is tightly written (the script), well directed, well acted movie....a good cop chasing bad guys movie which works.<br /><br />The script is very spare....unneeded words and scenes are not there. The movie moves from start to finish.<br /><br />Steve McQueen's facial closeups are a very important part of the success of this movie. He was a true movie star, a magnetic personality always interesting to watch in all ways....no other movie he ever made has as many high quality closeups of his face, which is riveting.<br /><br />The opening credits done by Pablo Ferro Films are notable, and one of the reasons the movie gets off to a good start and makes friends early with the audience.<br /><br />The credits are creative, interesting, compelling, and a bit eerie in a good way.....they are truly part of the movie, and that is almost never true of most credits (which may explain why many recent movies dispense with credits at the start of the film almost completely and delay credits until after the story is complete.<br /><br />The end of the movie outdoor chase at the San Francisco CA USA nighttime airport with Steve McQueen chasing the main villain under passing large planes doesn't quite work, and is the only major flaw in an otherwise very well done movie.<br /><br />This is probably Steve McQueen's very best movie, and he did several movies of very high quality both as regards his actor work and other aspects of his movies.<br /><br />Here is some information about the history of the world premiere of \\"Bullitt\\" (1968), which took place in San Francisco, California USA where the movie was shot during the Spring of 1968.....<br /><br />I was hired in late Fall 1968 to assist the publicity team for the Warner Bros. field office in San Francisco, CA USA which premiered BULLITT (1968).<br /><br />Warner Brothers HQ in NYC, NY USA (adminstrative offices for WB were in NYC, and NOT in Hollywood, where the studio was located....interestingly the studio had nothing to do with BULLITT (1968), shot entirely on location) set up a national \\"press junket\\" to promote BULLITT (1968) and invited major newspaper and other media reporters who covered and reviewed movies to San Francisco CA USA for the opening of BULLITT (1968) in November 1968.<br /><br />Warner Bros. and other major studios traditionally did this for openings of major movies, and paid all travel and local expenses for invited media coverage guests.<br /><br />Major Warner Bros. executives were flown to SF CA USA, and so were other employees working for Warner Brothers, especially regional publicity staff workers located in major cities around the USA, as well as the Warner Brothers publicity staff from the WB studio in Hollywood.<br /><br />Steve McQueen flew up to SF CA USA from Hollywood where in late 1968 he was engaged in shooting THE REIVERS (1969), a movie where he starred in a famous William Faulkner authored comedy story set in Mississippi at the turn of the last century (c. 1900).<br /><br />McQueen entered the movie house in the SF CA USA \\"cow hollow\\" area where the movie was premiered, and personally welcomed and addressed the gathered VIP visitors.<br /><br />His hair was uncharacteristically shaggy due to the part he played in THE REIVERS.<br /><br />He urged VIP visitors to pay particular attention to \\"our great chase scene\\" in the movie, and clearly regarded that as the high point of the movie.<br /><br />\\"Bullitt\\" (1968) actually has three chase scenes....two on foot and one in cars....he meant the one in the cars (chases on foot occurred in a large hospital before the car chase, and also at the SF Airport after the car chase).<br /><br />BULLITT (1968) was produced by a movie production Steve McQueen owned called \\"Solar Productions\\" which was headed by Robert Relyea, also present during the BULLITT (1968) premiere opening activity.<br /><br />After the screening BULLITT (1968) for the VIP audience, several parties were set up in various sections of San Francisco CA USA to which official guests and others were invited.<br /><br />The entire BULLITT (1968) San Francisco CA USA movie premiere event held during October 1968 was exceedingly and intentionally glamorous.<br /><br />Many of the executives working for Warner Brothers who had

B003TSEEDY|5.0|This book is probably the most inspiring novel I have ever read. It conveys so much emotion and captures the audiences attention more than almost any book I've read before. This will definitely be one that I'll read more than once!
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I love the ease of this product...you can book mark, unbookmark. It allows you to check your archive which for me is a plus,<br /> because I have books on several devises. All in all a very user friendly item.
B00992CF6W|4.0|you can download this same game for free at 4shared .com and down load it for free .The game in general is good but it sucks in creative mode because you have tnt but cant explode it.

B007ZGO7EM|5.0|what can I say? this is a calculator and thus a very handy addition to the Fire. Highly recommended. And its free!
B008KEA6ZM|5.0|Every song on this album is excellent.  \\"Coma Girl\\" kicks it off and sets the tone for the album; story threads run throughout it.  The 2012 reissue includes great live tracks.  This is a must-have for any Joe Strummer fan.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|The book was good but he should have just finished it in this book instead of making another one. I mean I can't wait but I would rather just be able to read it now instead of waiting a whole nother  year.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I loved this book.  I've read it 2 or 3 times now.  I cannot wait for the third and final book in the trilogy.

B008MM9630|5.0|like the app; just don't like that you have to spend money on gems to get a lot of the items.
B0054VVRBQ|1.0|Transcend SDXC ExpressCard reader does not work.  Transcend TS-RDF1, S/N 491196-4795.  It was easier to order a SanDisk ExpressCard Adapter.  Time and effort spent to complain and wait for a replacement was more than I wanted to pay.  Decided to just order the SanDisk.  Too much expense involved with contacting Transcend and mailing the defective device to them.  Transcend will now be put on my Avoid List.  Save yourself a headache, buy from someone else.  Amazon shows no interest in replacing the defective item.  They don't seem to care what is sold by whom.  They are no different than most of these internet companies.  More volume means More $$$.  Long live the all mighty $$$.  The religion for the 21st Century.
B008AYCSE4|5.0|I was initially concerned about the quality of the used copy of the DVD before purchasing it.  After viewing it I was quite pleased with its quality.  I would not have known that it was used.  The price was a bargain given the quality of the DVD.
B008IYR2BA|5.0|Dexter is simply one of the best series available to watch. I rank Dexter along with Breaking Bad. We actually allow ourselves only one episode per week so it will last longer.
0316228532|5.0|I like this book, and had a hard time putting it down. Yes, it was long, but because of JKR's writing skills it was a much quicker read than many other more turgid books with fewer pages. Yes, there were a lot of characters. That worked for me, too. It took a while to keep all of them straight, just like when one joins a new family, however ultimately they became a most interesting mosaic which clearly illustrated life in a small town. Yep, many of the characters were unlikable, but isn't that often the case everywhere? The book clearly paints the conservative versus liberal positions (in which we in the U.S. are a few years behind Britain, where their austerity program isn't working out well). While the book had a sad ending, it clearly showed that even the most disadvantaged of us have dreams of a better life.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Pinterest is step one for the Hoarders Recovery Program.  A stomping ground for all creative, curious and witty hipsters/moms/techy dudes/DIY'ers.  Shamelessly gathering pictures of every maybe, can't do without and why the heck not?!!
B008FPOIT6|4.0|Picked this up as an Indie Pick and found it to be a completely enjoyable read - a literary puzzle based in current times. It kept me guessing until the end... :-)
B009JCL58G|5.0|This soundtrack is one of the best. Very moving. Buy it now :D I enjoyed the soundtrack after watching the movie a second time.
B000FC1HBY|5.0|A fantastic series of adventures told with character and plot development easily comparable to Herbert and Tolkein. Cannot wait to continue with the next in series...
B007FG9LIE|4.0|Most of the cheaper books I've gotten recently have been boring but that's not the case with this book. It kept me entertained. It was also a little spooky which is nice. Worth the money for sure.
B008476HBM|5.0|While \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" itself needs no review, since it's the best loved romance novel of all time, it's nice to have it available in a format my telephone based reader can handle. Now, even in the can, I'll never be without refined reading material!
B005COO1X6|3.0|Rarely do I find something so disappointing in SK's work that it stays with me long after having read it.<br />It's in this one, though: after a skillful start that took me back to the magic of novels like IT and Christine the story moves toward a conclusion unworthy of this author's abilities. Half ludicrous and hastily done.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|Loved the movie, the 4 pack is awesome with blue ray in one room, DVD on another, digital copy is great in iTunes.
0399157565|5.0|For both new and old Scarpetta fans, The Bone Bed truly delivers. Cornwell has always had a magical touch with making her characters vibrant,realistic and alive. This novel is no exception to that formula. She pulls the reader directly into every scene.Whether it is the cold waters of the Boston harbor or the bright glare of the autopsy room,the reader feels as if they are there with Scarpetta. You see and feel exactly what she does.<br /><br />All the familiar characters are back along with several new ones and even an old friend. In each book Cornwell writes, her characters grow and change just as people do in real life. Because of this, their overall interactions with each other and the dynamics of their relationships unfold. Scarpetta becomes even more human in this novel as she is faced with secrets from those closest to her.<br /><br />From a murder at a dinosaur dig in Alberta to crimes in Boston, the reader will be kept guessing all the way through to the end trying to solve how they connect and who is behind them. Excitement, drama, and suspense abound in this gem of a novel. After the unexpected ending, I am left eagerly awaiting the next installment in this fascinating series.
B00992CF6W|5.0|it wont let me get this app because it says an error has occurred... I deleted some of my app space and it still doesn't work? help please?
B004OO4UFY|4.0|I got this album after I played borderlands 2 and enjoy all of the music on this, very much worth it
B00992CF6W|5.0|This is the best app on my kindle. It works amazingly. I don't know why you would give a bad review. It's amazing!!!!!!!!!!!!!! If you didn't already buy it you should.
B009CPJHY4|4.0|We enjoyed this film.  It is probably geared more for \\"older\\" adults as we can relate more to their personalities.  If you are a young adult, this may not be the film for you.
1401937268|5.0|I have always been skeptical to tarot as it has always been to be just a little scary. So I have always used Oracle decks until now. When My Angel Tarot deck arrived I was excited and at the same time nervous about using them. I am still learning how to use them as week speak and have owed the deck for several months now. The more I use them the clearer the messages are and the more confidant I feel. The artwork on this deck is just breath taking and beautiful. Just and all around great deck.
B006WZLCZ4|5.0|Product is great made to last and perfect size for toddlers. The orange color is perfect not too bright.I would definitely recommended this kit.
B00571F26Y|3.0|I found the information very helpfull and am following some of the advice provided. However, the book is way to technical and for that reason difficult to stay with and read cover to cover. I have had to take a break by reading something else and will go back to Wheat Belly to finish the book.<br /><br />Hank
B0058VW36U|5.0|This game was so fun but it was a little bit to short. If there was more levels it would be so awesome. It's awesome though. Buy it if you didn't!
B008NABUU8|5.0|this is a lot of fun. even for an engineering major bored. definitely worth the $2. I like the cable suspension bridges most.
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|i know from past experience that some free version apps suck, but this one is great because it takes a while to finish the game and it is very challenging and fun.
B008673ZAQ|4.0|My book club started this trilogy after reading Fifty Shades and there are so many similarities that it would surprise me if was not intentional. Even the main characters Eva vs Ava and Gideon Cross vs Christian Grey (GC vs CG)are ironically similar.  Just like Fifty Shades, it is a very quick read and the pages turn effortlessly and the sex scene are still hot as ever.  The end of the last chapter of this second book really answered many questions that we all had after the first book. I love that two physically and emotionally damaged individuals can find love, lust and trust in one another.  Excited to read the final book to discover what this hot couple's future holds.
B000ICXQOM|5.0|I love this movie! Every time I watch I am reminded of the awesomeness of Bruce Campbell and Sam Raimi.
B00062PN6I|5.0|These headphones are beyond excellent for the price! They work well in live performance and are certainly better in the studio for mixing purposes in contrast to Dre Beats Studios. A 1/8\\"-1/4\\" adapter comes with these headphones as well (specially designed to screw/unscrew onto the 1/8\\" end of the cable). The headphones also handle high and low frequency response way better than they should, considering they're only $9.99. This is definitely a steal and I highly recommend this to anyone looking for monitor headphones, or just to jam out to your iPod/mp3 player!
B000000WZ4|5.0|Before this Cd came out i only used to listen  Depeche Mode on radio or TV. Yes, when music was actually aired on TV.<br />Barrel of a Gun ( first song of the album ) was re-leased before the album and i loved it right away. All the darkness in the video, in the lyrics , great guitars, great vocals , the emotional deprivation of it. Just class.<br />Then the CD came out ( ok fine, i bought the tape , we were listening to tapes back then in 97) and i bought it without knowing any other songs.<br />Most of the songs are ballads on it, except Useless , It's no good and Barrel.<br />Ballads or not, all the tracks are great for me.<br />The electronics are brilliant, the lyrics, the melody...everything fits perfectly...<br />My favorites songs are Barrel of a Gun, Home, Useless, Freestate and Insight.<br />After this Cd i bought many others Depeche Mode ones, but i don't like them as much as Ultra. I know people are talking about Violator or SOFAD as their best works, but for me those albums don't even equal half of this one.<br />What came after Ultra was just...music. This is art. This is beyond music. This is feelings. Pain. Suffering. Re-Birth.
B0098VXBIA|3.0|Nothing special, sometimes it is funny, sometimes it is boring. I am happy that i didn't go to the movies to watch it.
B000SGGUWS|4.0|Its a really slow read I would say but other than that its nice. It is nothing like the show though.
B00843TZJ2|1.0|I could not find the audio set up for this Blu-Ray from the top menu. There should be a choice for an audio set up but there is not. I have never seen a  blu ray disk without this feature. Can I return this item?
B0054JZC6E|5.0|it could be updated but its addictive to play. the point system could a update aswell it gets boring having to play the same game over and over jut to get the next game.
B009KHCT94|1.0|Husband endured the whole thing but I gave up 1/3 of the way through.  Premise was fantastic and had the potential to be a very funny, over-the-top film.  I think I was expecting something campy along the lines of the musical, The Producers.  But execution was embarrassing: direction, editing, characterizations-- all clunky.  It made me marvel yet again at what actors are willing to do to be onscreen.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|I love angry birds I have it on my ipod how cool angry birds is so flipping awesome I play it every day
B008XX6J4C|5.0|My family and I have followed these guys since they started, and even before! We are excited that they are finally able to come out with an album like this, and that they are now signed with Sony. We really hope this means that more will be coming in the future, and look forward to it! Their work gives classical music a different spin, but this is no cheesy pop-artist rendition of old favorites! Both the pianist and the cellist are incredible musicians, well trained in traditional classical music. They and the rest of the crew collaborate to create music that is extremely varied, irresistible, and a delight for old and young. Their songs range from peaceful and somber to powerful and toe-tapping! I would highly recommend checking out their YouTube profile here:[...] Not only is their music great, but they have music videos to go along!<br />(Hopefully that link works... If not, just type ThePianoGuys into YouTube's search bar, and you're sure to see a page full of their videos, plus a link to their profile. I hope this was helpful!)
B0013F1D02|5.0|The title of the review says it all. I can't put it any other way. LOVE this movie! And the book is fantastic, too!
0385474547|5.0|This book was required reading for class at St. Croix Good Hope School. Even though it was reqired I found it entertaining and informative about culture and traditions in this part of Africa.<br /><br />I have always been curious about Africa and the traditions on the different continents. The author Chinua Achebe brought this story to life and gave me the feeling of being present. I felt like the heroine in the story. I thought what she thought, felt what she felt, ate what she ate, did what she did.<br /><br />I recommend this book.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|This book was hard to put down very good I can not wait until the next one comes out:) very good book
B004FGMDOQ|5.0|Thoroughly enjoyed this book from start to finish...plays with the imagination,<br /> and certainly makes you look at people in ones own life in a different light...could be<br />described as spooky in a way!
B007SYWFRM|5.0|This is a fantastic game, if you are looking for something to keep you constantly semi entertained. Theres not much of a challenge, but its more so about being able to juggle a lot of small tasks at one time. the graphics are entertaining, and the fact you can play mini games within it is a plus; it keeps it interesting.
B009IKPOUO|5.0|She only gets better with age.  I wish I could see her live in concert.  However, I don't see her coming to Nashville.
B001EC2ISA|3.0|why would i buy it to own it on my Amazon cloud when it is a lower res version than the cheaper Blu-Ray disc on Amazon already... really now Amazon you need to fix that. digital media shouldnt cost MORE than a physical copy (that comes with a digital copy in most cases)
B007URVZJ6|4.0|I found this book helpful in giving me an overview and the basics I needed to move forward with putting an ebook on amazon.
0316228532|4.0|NO SPOILERS<br /><br />So I was pretty excited when JKR announced her new book. As a die-hard Harry Potter fan, I was eager to see what she had brought to the table. I knew it was going to be an adult novel, but I was assuming this simply meant an older cast and no magic. I was wrong on this count. It is very much an adult novel, and that's partially why I gave the book 4 out of 5 stars instead of 5. Not because of the adult content (I'm 20 years and can thus handle it), but it seems like in the first few chapters she is trying to shove its adultness into your face. Also, the beginning of the book is slow in a few regards as you get to know the wide cast of characters and the history of the central problem of the novel. However, once you bypass these facts, JKR once again proves her extreme talent in providing incredibly detailed and in-depth characters. She makes you take second glances at people whom you would probably despise in real life and second guess your own treatment of such people.<br /><br />However, there are two other negatives I'd like to point out. The book deals with tough subjects in a very real way, but she deals with so many tied so neatly within in her cast of characters that it's not quite believable. Secondly, the fact that there is almost NOTHING that is positive about the book. Granted I don't expect every book to end in a meadow of daisies where every lives happily ever after, but almost everything is left off in an incredibly depressing fashion with no upside.<br /><br />All of that said, I very much enjoyed the book once JKR settled into her natural writing and found the topics refreshingly honest, even if it could have been toned down overall. This is NOT a book to turn to for positive messages or for the hope of a happy ending, but the characters, while not usually the most likable, are all compelling in their own ways a create a fascinating and tragic dynamic. 4 out of 5 and recommended if you can handle it. DO NOT read it simply if you are a fan of HP. With the exception of her well-written characters, to even remotely compare the series with this novel is almost laughable. Both are brilliant in entirely different ways and should be treated as such.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|This show is so well written, acted and filmed and every episode leaves you wanting more. Season 3 cant come soon enough.
B004LWZWGK|4.0|Ok let's get something straight. Yes this is a spectacular film but is it perfect? Definately not. If I look at this from an audience members point of view then yes it does have some plot holes but it's still pretty damn awesome. From a comic book nerds point of view though the problems are easier to see.<br />Where's Bane's venom or better yet his South American origin? Yes I understand that the venom may have been omitted due to the film being more realistic but I'm sure that there is some form of steroid that has at least similarities to venom. Any form of steroid would've been good actually since it would make him more powerful then before. Another problem was his mask. I WAS DEFINITELY NOT FEELING IT. It wasn't that I couldn't understand him in fact I understood him pretty well. My problem was that it was so different from his comic mask that it almost felt like a different character. That doesn't mean it should've been as cheesy as the one in Batman and Robin I'm just saying that they could've easily found a way to pay homage to it. After all the luchador look of the mask immediately gave you a feel for his South American heritage. Was it a completely all out luchador mask in the comics? No but you could tell that in its own way it was like a homage to them.<br />Also there are people complaining that Batman wasn't in the film enough of the time but go back to the KnightQuest storyline the one that's apart of Knightfall and you can see that Batman himself was also hardly in that.
B005QUQP76|5.0|The Corsair M60 meets beyond expectations. I thought the default weight was fine, but adjustments can be made if necessary. The cloth wire also prevents tangles and bends. The ambient blue lighting is also a nice touch; it's not too flashy, but rather classy. It also fits my hand very well and so far I have no complaints on its ergonomics. Beautiful product!
B009439HEY|5.0|Agree with most of the reviews here. I know I couldn't go wrong ordering this. Steven Wilson or Mikael Åkerfeldt would not participate on a mediocre album I thought. I was initially surprised how close it was to the originals until I put my headphones on and listened very carefully. That was an ear-opener. I love the added dynamics to some of the pieces - crystal clear without sounding dry. I love the use of different vocalists, even in the same piece (e.g. SR). My favorites are still the same favorites (Supper's Ready, Can-Utility and the Coastliners, some of the organ/drum rhythm chases are merely spectacular on SR - goose bumps). I also love \\"A Tower Struck Down\\" from my favorite SH album - wow, how powerful! (btw. can somebody tell me who plays drums on this piece? Most of the tracks are played by Gary O'Toole on disk 2, not on this one (9) though and there is no other artist listed with drums - curious).<br /><br />I am happy to see that my 13yr old kids like the music as well and they cannot believe that most of this was created 40 years ago.<br /><br />Masterpieces turned into Masterpieces
B007URVZJ6|4.0|This guide is very helpful- I wish I had read it before I started building my book for Kindle.  It's easy to read and follow.  I think it would be most helpful for those who are using the latest edition of Word.
B0083SBMBM|3.0|I really really really wanted to LOVE this movie but in the end I think I set my expectations too high (just like with The Dark Knight Rises). It had many good action scenes but just because they introduced all the characters in the previous movies doesn't mean that they had to go lackluster on the story here. Don't get me wrong seeing all these characters together was awesome but I still felt like I didn't really know them completely. And I thought the whole bit with the aliens fell into been there done that territory. Oh well I'm sure Avengers 2 will be better. Overall this was a fun movie just not perfect. Enjoyable but not the best superhero movie ever.
B0091REZMW|4.0|Fun game but it sure can be a waste of time.  But don't let that stop you in getting it. Go have fun!
B0086700CM|5.0|this game is so fun!!! and is very addictive! if you're looking for a new and exciting game to play then you're in the right direction! download now!
B008MJGQ0O|5.0|I've been listening to John Abercrombie since TIMELESS and can enthusiastically recommend this beautiful release as one of his very best.  Groundbreaking? No, but this tribute to his musical heroes is a subtle return to his roots and he has able support from Lovano, Gress & Baron.  Mostly covers but ever so tastefully done.  I'm very glad John and Manfred Eicher have teamed up once again with a solid outing; easily one of his top 5 quartet releases for ECM.
B00006I53S|4.0|I have been using this lens for the last 4 years now, and I am truly satisfied with it.  My photographic strength lies in creativity and not the technical side of it, so I am not able to pick apart any softness or any other terms used to describe lens qualities.  All I can tell you is this lens has been on my camera for over 95% of the photos I have taken over the last 4 years.  So if you are looking for a very dependable \\"walk-around\\" lens, don't hesitate to pick this one up.
030758836X|1.0|I forced myself to read this to the end, but only to finish and delete it from my bookshelf.<br /><br />I found the characters really unlikeable. The language was persistently offensive. There was nothing intriguing about the two protagonists.The plot twists were predictable. I kept reading, thinking it would become ... intriguing or redeeming.  But, it just showed a waste of humanity, both of them, ugly and weak or cruel. Just ugly.  I wish I had not read it to the end.  There was no insight or discovery or growth. Just even more ugliness.<br /><br />Don't bother.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|amazing app.  very good and useful.  i can know everything about my battery shot now haha i lovee this app
B002AKPECW|4.0|The creativity of the future world is excellent.  The story that weaves things together is pretty good too -- primarily a mystery, with a measure of action.<br /><br />The imagination and integrity/cohesiveness of the plot are five star attributes, but a few things knock the book down for me.  For one, it is somewhat handicapped by Reynold's fairly modest skills in building characters that feel real and 3 dimensional.  You do get to know the 2 main characters -- but that is mostly because there are only 2 POVs and the book is almost 600 pages, not because Reynolds pays enough attention to characterization.  Its like you muddle along for 50 pages, then learn that Campion is impulsive, and Purslane is careful, and in other 50 pages you learn a bit more, and so on, until EVENTUALLY they become 3 dimensional people -- more or less.  You never learn, for example, why they love each other, or how their forbidden love came to be.  One gets the sense that the characters are secondary, just along for the ride.<br /><br />Another knock is that while the ending has integrity (no deux ex machina), it does feel a bit neat and rushed in some respects.  Perhaps more importantly, it doesnt feel entirely complete.  Indeed, the author has stated that he would like to \\"finish\\" the story at \\"some point\\" but as far as I saw in searching the web, it doesnt sound like a sequel has been started or has a specific start date.<br /><br />While Reynolds is a fairly popular sci-fi author, not all care for him because of perceived gaps in his writing ability.  I am in the non-fan group, but nonetheless enjoyed House of Suns quite a bit because of the tremendously imaginative universe Reynolds created, and am glad I read it.
B008C0C1Y8|3.0|Followed comic book too closely in regards to looks. But cool considering the limited cgi they had at the time. Good for watching to bring back you're memories of movies from your youth.
B008GVD6D8|4.0|I enjoyed this book but nit as much as the first till I git past the first few chapters then I didn't want it to end can't wait for the next one to see what happens
1451695195|3.0|I was hoping to read more details about what he experienced, what questions of his were answered, etc.  Very few details were given of his experience in the \\"afterlife\\".  However, his message of love and being connected to each other was a great reminder.
B00992CF6W|4.0|It's a fun game but does get boring after a while. It does need many updates like, lava, mine carts, the underworld like on x box, and many others but other than that it's good. (-:
B000SEIK2S|5.0|Great characterization and good action.  Little bad language and a reasonable ending.  Could have resulted in another book.  It did \\"Last Colony\\" which was OK but not as good.  Other related books he wrote have little relationship to the \\"Old Mans War\\".  I would recommend this book but not the others.
B0085Z8F4A|1.0|a bunch of monkeys could have come up with a better story. Even Theron does not help. Ridley Scott should have shown some respect to his own masterpiece (alien series) and never made this horrible movie or at least have not attempted to associate it with the alien series.
B004NOH9LW|5.0|This is simply an outstanding movie from start to finish. Client Eastwood does a marvelous directing a story that will touch the hearts of anyone who has ever lost a loved one. The acting is superb, the story captivating and the special effects are second to none. (The filming of the tsunami sequence is truly unbelievable). With all of this stated, I am giving Hereafter 5 Stars.
B004XJRQUQ|4.0|Very enjoyable!  Felt captivated throughout. I think everyone who reads these books will feel the same way. Thanks Suzanne Collins.
B009CPES4I|5.0|Great actors and great theme and good characterization.  Not an action movie or an explosion movie!<br />Gives you something to think about and has morality.  Recommend it.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|A co-worker showed me this group on youtube. One night my son was in a particular mood to not go to sleep. In an act of desperation I pulled them up. He loved it and went to sleep within minutes. I bought this cd for him as a birthday gift he turned one. Now we listen to it in the car or at home. He instantly relaxes. And he loves the music. When we are at home he prefers the youtube videos.
B0098VYCCE|1.0|On paper (and in commercials), this looked like it should work and that made it's failure all the more disappointing. The back story was hurried together and created no sympathy or depth in the characters. For all the rich visuals, I never felt completely immersed and there was no broken ground - everything looked like something that had been done already and done better. Charlize Theron's character should have been much juicier, a queen that you rooted against but enjoyed watching. She simply was not fun to watch. The movie was unsuccessful at creating a sense of dread. By the time the dwarves showed up, I was completely checked out and the rest of the movie - too long, by the way - was a complete drag.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|The mark of Athena was an action pact book that kept me on my toes the whole time I didn't ever want to put it down Rick Riordan always seems to make his storys more and more interesting
B00866JL96|1.0|WHEN I SEEN THE TRAILER FOR THIS FILM I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE AMAZING.. I READ THE BOOK AND WAITED FOR THE FILM TO COME OUT ON DVD, THE BOOK WAS BREATH TAKING. I FINALLY WATCHED THE MOVIE AND WAS COMPLETELY DISAPPOINTED. IN THE BOOK THERE IS SO MUCH PASSION BETWEEN THE MAIN CHARACTERS AND THE MOVIE FAILED TO SHOW THE WANT EACH CHARACTER HAD FOR ONE ANOTHER.. I RECOMEND NOT SEEING THE MOVIE AND READING THE BOOK.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book - Sometimes tragic, sometimes hilarious, but always excellent.  I believe all Americans should read this book.
B008Y2FRFO|2.0|I loved game in got to level75 or 80 and had a lot of prides and then it reset itself and I lost everything. I'm so upset I will not start over cousin its a pointless game. but fun
B0046B3QTG|5.0|I'm a 41 year old man & recently watched this with my niece's little guy.  I found myself howling at some of the jokes in this movie!
0307744434|5.0|This is a book that will take you away into a time and place of mystery and wonder. It is about a circus that you can only attend from dark until daylight. There are illusionists, fortune tellers, contortionists and numerous unique characters as well as a never ending stream of tents filled full of wondrous things. I just liked to sit and imagine as I read. It took me back to the time as a child when I believed that all things were possible. This book is worth reading just for the atmosphere alone. I want to run off and join The Night Circus!
B00846TRHY|3.0|A good 8-8.5, it is a touching, heart breaking and gripping movie. Keep in mind you will want to see more violence at some key points<br /><br />of the story towards the child enslaving adult bad guys and not just for story pace but revenge you the viewer will want for the<br /><br />protagonist and his children. The whole movie is about this one man and his lopsided dedication to these children and for that the<br /><br />other characters suffer development but the point is well made with decent acting from everybody.
0765367297|5.0|Halo: The Fall of Reach is honestly in my top five greatest books that i've ever read.  The other four being other Halo books.  This story is not what most people would think it is, its not a short comic book, or nerdy game based novel, it has about 400 pages and keep you wanting more and more every word you read. Its an extremely well written story for those of a high reading level.  It is full of intense moments were you cant stop reading for hours and rarely has a boring moment.  There is endless amounts of action and is has sudden suprises on every page.  There are few books that can compare to the Halo series because of their immense detaial and vast universe that it is based off of.  The author Eric Nylnd does not fail to meet expectations for such a popular title.  He describes every character with their needed information and keeps the story flowing at a perfect pase.  The book is moderatly clean in terms of language, and has no suggestive remarks, but the only thing parents should worry about is the deep description of the fighting scenes in remarks to the gory deaths.  I would (and I am) recomending this book to anyone looking for a great science fiction story to read and to obviously to anyone who loves anything to do with the Halo series that we all know.
B00992CF6W|5.0|been waiting for pocket edition of mine craft. great game waiting for updates. buy this game. great for on the go or if you cant get Pc or Xbox buy it you wont have any regreets.
B00846REIS|5.0|More believable and better written  than Fifty Shades. I enjoyed being apart of this love journey which took me up and down which is how most relationships go.
B0086449YA|1.0|After much anticipation in the long break since Get Lucky, I figured two discs would have some good stuff.  No such luck.  There's not a single keeper classic.  No tour from this one.
B0043UB0BQ|5.0|I just have one thing to say about this show is Awesome and thats the bottom line. Its a must see for all.
B0095R76EW|3.0|It had its funny parts and overall a good ending but it seemed to drag on in the middle. Some unnecessary events were thrown in. Overall a good movie.
B008FPOIT6|5.0|Techy storyline, very colorful characters and contemporary references blend with some historical mystery to create a page turning read.  Set in San Francisco in economic times we can all relate to, computer science meets mystique, making one ponder the possiblities of where our cyber world may be heading.  Enjoyed this book tremendously!
B008IJT0CE|2.0|I used to love this app, and used it all the time. Now, however, it won't let me open the app unless I open the Amazon App Store, and then when I try to open the app - it just goes to the store, and opens it in Japanese so I can't even exit. I am uninstalling the app and getting some other program that doesn't have so many issues.<br /><br />If you're an insomniac, as I am, I urge you to try this app. I have had plenty of nature sound cds & white noise machines, but for me, no one thing works for long. This app let's me customise the sound & change it up as often as I like. Try the free version & see what you think!
B0012QRPU4|5.0|I was hooked on Breaking Bad from the first episode.  Downloaded and watched on my new Kindle Fire for a long flight to Las Vegas.
B009NQKXYK|3.0|Movie was ok but I'm not a fan of the alien series anyway. But i guess it was interesting none the less.
B002GSXKN8|5.0|This collection has been great fun for my kids.  All four, from ages 4-9 enjoy watching this video together!  It may be the oldest of the Batman series, but they don't know that and love it all the same.
B001ANYDAO|5.0|Brilliant topic with a great tie-in with Gladwell's own heritage. Inspires the reader to focus on their own success and spend more time perfecting it.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|i loved every bit of it!!\\" Bring on the next one!! can' t wait to.see what happens next with Christian and Anna!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|It took me about a week to read all 5.  I never wanted the story to end and I really look forward to the continuation.  Thanks Hugh for a great read!
B0098VXBIA|3.0|Thought the movie was rather slow. I really expected more humor. Considering the stars in this movie it should have been better.
0316228532|5.0|I don't care if this isn't about Harry Potter, the book is magical in its own way and JK still is one of my favorite writers ever. Amazing story, totally recommend it!
B007RV6X2Y|4.0|We really enjoyed this movie, keeps you guessing. Would give 5 stars; however, we didn't like the mix-up with father/daughter
B000FC1HBY|5.0|This is #2 of the \\"Song of Ice and Fire\\" series by;  George R. R. Martin and I can hardly wait to read book #3.  Such complex characters, and the setting is so right for the story.  I love the Dire Wolves, they are beautiful, (even though there are no actual pictures, Mr. Martin makes the reader see them), and I am waiting with bated breath to see what the dragons are going to be capable of.  If you enjoy fantasy, read this series.  You can't possibly be disappointed, it's just so much fun and so difficult to put down.
B006AZZPCM|3.0|Simple to use but frustrating trying to get to what you want sometimes. Tried numerous times to access my Premier guitar subscription but it won't play the video's in it have to go to You tube direct and type in the page

0547564651|4.0|I have not completed reading the book yet. I will let you know once I have finished reading the book.
1423140605|5.0|Another great installment in this series; well liked by my 6th grader and fun for parents as well.  Would recommend this book.
B009HXG9UQ|5.0|This movie was very artistic and beautifully done! It was addictive to watch and is now one of my absolute favorite movies now!
B007MDB6L0|5.0|i just recently purchased and watched secret of the wings and i really loved it.i loved how disney put this movie together and how they came up with the idea for this character.i just this and the other movies done on Tinkerbell,i really fell in love with her when she was in Peterpan that's how i got to know her. this is one spectacular movie made by disney. so anybody who is a big Tinkerbell fan and has not bought this movie yet should buy it  because this is a movie worth buying and worth the wait.i can really,really,really gurantee it.chrisfan.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|the game is decent enough, at least it's not as irritating as the real life thing, so i'm happy about that.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|okay I say four and a half stars but I cant put that its awesome I play with my cousin Korinne s. all the time the thing is the ads are sooooooo annoying! I always click the ads by accadent trying to get to my home page!!!!!!! I have a kindle fire
B00280LYIC|5.0|if you miss Harry Potter, you'll find your next fav new series here. You will be hooked before you finish the first page
B007THA4FI|5.0|Takes place in a small town in the U.K.  Lots of terms in the text are British but you can figure them out.  There is a cast of characters in the small town that are all effected by the sudden death of a city councillor and the vacancy it creates.  The cast of characters have varied issues in their own lives besides the death of the councillor but all these issues come together in a moment of awareness for many of the characters. The overlapping of the stories, I thought, was very good, quite clever and made the reading interesting.  I thought alot about the story after I finished it. I have recommended it to my friends.
B0095R76EW|1.0|I was fortunate to nod off a couple of times, while my wife had the unfortunate experience of watching the entire movie.  About as bad as a movie gets and not worth the time to elaborate on it.  Even the attempts at stereo-type humor that might have made me laugh were stale and unimaginative.  Renting this movie was my mistake, don't make it yours.
B008XNZMOU|5.0|I ALWAYS LOVE TAYLOR, AND THIS CD IS REALLY INCREDIBLE! I LOVE IT SO MUCH! AND IT'S WELL PROTECTED WHEN IT GOT HERE. :)
1451662432|5.0|Arnold started with nothing.  Everything he achieved was through his own hard work.  I admire that tremendously.  His determination and drive have their negative aspects, and he's certainly made mistakes.  Smug people who will never accomplish the tiniest fraction of what Arnold has have plenty to say about that. (Go look at the 1-star reviews.)  I admire him anyway, and really enjoyed his book.

B008S847X2|4.0|Another great release from mclaughlin, this time with the 4th dimension band. Great interplay and fantastic playing. If you are a fan of mclaughlin (especially his later releases) then you won't be disappointed in the slightest.
B004UPALT6|1.0|What can I say?, Poor acting, Poor special affects, Poor cinematography it was pretty crummy. The story line was good but poorly implemented as a movie. Over all don't waste you time watching this movie.
B0097GVJWQ|4.0|I could not put it down. Good mystery. More than just seek and find. I liked putting the clues together. Good story.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Love this game! Worth paying for the App to have NO advertisements between games.<br /><br />Anyone who enjoys Angry Birds will enjoy this game and levels of play.
B00936A2SM|4.0|Great musicians just jamming and laying down some good tunes and grooves. Smart tunes that manage to stay rocking and funky. Love the weather report cover of 'mysterious traveler' and billy cobham's 'stratus'.
B004GBIE3Y|5.0|We were looking for something to watch and my wife saw this.  After watching the trailer, we decided to go for it and we couldn't have been happier.  It's quirky and it looks, at first, like it's aimed at a teenage audience, but I found it to be appealing and very funny (though much of the humor centered around teenage angst and awkwardness.) Zack Galifinakis is great in it, but \\"The Hangover\\" it is NOT.  While Galifinakis is his trademark character, the overall flavor to the movie is something more like Juno.  Highly recommend if you're looking for something original and a little off the beaten path.
0316228532|4.0|Jk Rowling is a prolific writer.  She makes up words and names and I found this to be<br />amazing.  Not sure this book would be a book I would refer.  She uses a lot of language<br />that was not necessary and she introduces so many characters in the first couple of pages<br />Good book to read.......not tht great
B006LSZECO|2.0|COULDN'T PUT THE BOOK DOWN.  GREAT ORIGINAL CONCEPT.  THIS COUPLE WAS SO UNLIKABLE, BUT VERY INTERESTING.  The end was so disappointing.  It fizzed out at the end.  I expected so much and got nothing.  It is like the author ran out of ideas.
B006VGGAC4|5.0|At the moment I haven't finished reading the whole book, but I believe my opinion at the end of reading 2 chapters is not gonna change for the rest of the book. Well, laid biography with minute details from the struggles and mental trauma to rise to the arena. I hope this biography of Schwarzenegger isn't just another man's life, it is very much a secret protocol for invocation of the legend in every man starting from the inception. The dreams and determination of a child, to take every opportunity to achieve it, makes him as an inspiring role model that you always wanted to show to your kid.<br />This book is a gift to everyone! Probably a perfect gift for your kids on christmas!
B008XG1X18|5.0|I am sooo happy to get this for my kindle fire! Now when my hubby is hoarding the laptop I can sneak away and pin until my little heart is content!
B008I3QZKU|1.0|Finally, after a four-year hiatus, The Killers broke the silence with their fourth studio album, 2012's Battle Born.  Turns out silence would've been easier on the ears.  This album couldn't have been further from Hot Fuss and Sam's Town if they'd tried (and they may've; it's really bad).  It's almost as if they decided to remake Day & Age with more engineering and less emotion (if that's even possible).  I don't know who their target audience is nowadays, and I'm not sure they do either; all I know is that it can't be the same people who made their earlier works fly off the shelves, skyrocketing them into superstardom.  I guess \\"what happens in Vegas\\" really should \\"stay in Vegas\\".  My guess is that The Killers will be reduced to `house band' at Caesar's Palace in no time.  On a positive note, Battle Born makes me appreciate Day & Age a lot more than I ever thought I could.<br />Oh, and I think it's time for The Killers to change their name to something a little less aggressive, such as \\"The Whiners\\" or perhaps \\"The Fray\\".  They don't deserve a cool name anymore.
B00884GR0W|5.0|the only thing this is missing are bombs. it would def help me dig deeper...and maybe more items that can be created, great game tho! oh and more animals and monsters
B002OSXDAU|5.0|The Fountainhead shows the clash of the two types of individual: the creator and the second-hander. Those who really run the world against those who get a ride in it without adding nothing of their own. If you want to understand why almost everything in the world does not work as well as it could, this book will enlighten you about the nature of competence and mediocrity and why the former tends to not be rewarded while the later is encouraged.
B007FXLZ9K|5.0|\\"Shame\\" is a movie that you won't soon forget. It's not simply a movie about sex...it's a lot more, and I'm rather surprised by its NC-17 rating, because the movie to my judgement is not gratuitous or excessive or offensive in its sexual content or imagery. The film has a quiet strength grounded by its extraordinary cinematography- visceral, restrained, urban, intimate, skewed, dangerous, and real at all turns. The story centers around Brandon, deftly portrayed by Michael Fassbender. He's in an office 9-5 in New York City; his apartment is sterile and cold. His office is a place of posturing and masculine one-upsmanship; his release is through sex, which in itself becomes a prison and and a compulsion. Yet as we see Michael's compulsion interfere with his life, I was not filled with disgust, revulsion, or pity but struck with how powerfully real and painful and fraught with humanity the portrait of the man became. When Brandon's chanteuse sister Sissy (expertly portrayed by Carey Mulligan) enters the picture (and camps out unwelcome and uninvited to his apartment)it is obvious the two share a complex and troubled past; the specifics are not elaborated upon but can be inferred. When Brandon's home life becomes more complicated, he seeks the company of his coworker Marianne. Brandon's stab at a more \\"normal\\" relationship reveals the primal fear he has of emotional intimacy when sex with Marianne can't be consummated. Her loving embrace and caresses bring Brandon genuine fear as opposed to his go-to porn, one-night stands,  and visits to prostitutes. Yes, the movie is about sex, but it is so much more. It is about the fear of intimacy that can cause extremes of behavior in all of us. It's about levels of dishonesty within ourselves and others,  power and perceptions therof, and a struggle for control over one of our most primal urges. A surprising ending and a thoughtful and sobering  conclusion reveal that the scars we carry on our body are often visible but more often buried underneath a veneer of normality.n buried underneath a veneer of normality.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I love this Crossfire series. I can't wait for the third book to come out. I actually like this series better than the Fifty Shades of Gray series and those books were awsome.
0345803493|5.0|I love this book just can't put it down I rate it at a ten if I could ...lol personaly allot of they things in it I couldn't do but its a thrill to read I recommended it to a couple of my friends and they love it
B009NQKXYK|5.0|Loved it. Wish part 2 would come soon! This movie was so awesome, would have bought it, but I would only have watched it the once.
B008XG1X18|4.0|I use this on my fire and don't understand the poor reviews.  I like the search. options better then the desktop edition.
0446580848|5.0|Another page turner and the subject matter couldn't be more relevant.  As usual Nelson melds fact and fiction with the skill of a true artisan.
0345803485|5.0|This book is the BOMB I had plenty of sleepless night trying to find what was next for Miss.Anastasia. and Mr.Grey love it...all I can say is keep them coming (books)
0316228532|3.0|I am sad to say this book read like every other \\"social commentary\\" novel written in the last 50 years.  I say this not because of the subject material, but because every last character was made grotesque in some way.  It should be noted that this is a tragedy in the classical sense - e.g., each character's downfall was inevitable, given their personal characteristics and the situation.  There is no grace or mercy for anyone here, just regret.  This may have not been the author's intent, but this is how it read, and it made me depressed, rather than burn with the desire to help people trapped in similar situations.
B005LAIIQC|2.0|This movie isn't that good because this movie tries to tie in the last Bourne movie wayyyy to much and then tried to create a new start using Jeremy Renner. That makes this movie a snooze fest and for what seems like the first half of the movie everyone just sits there and talks about what pretty much has happened. Then, they talked about what is happening now and what will happen. There's NO ACTION. You just think about what they are saying and wait to hear the next part of what they will say...that is, if you are still AWAKE!!!<br /><br />If you really enjoyed the Bourne movies before, you don't want to watch this. It's not as good. Don't waste your money or time as you be asking yourself why did I watch this at the end???<br /><br />Also, I really hate the ending in this movie. It's so bad and forced to have a good ending. If they want to have a good ending they should do it right and just end it like that. That's so bad that it's shouldn't had happened like that. But, since they pretty much bored us to die in the first half of the movie, they just had to quickly end the movie because obviously running out of movie time and it's sinks already.<br /><br />---Minor spoilers---<br /><br />So, the movie can't be saved. At the end, they just like to end it at a happy ending and try to make the viewer dumb down a little by saying forget about what you saw for the movie. Umm NO! Why should one main bad guy dying be a problem for the true people in charge in their offices. They have a ton of people. They tracked down Jeremy Renner's character so far from around the world, they would still be tracking him down after the main bad guy dies. What's one bad guy down going to do to the true people in charge? Nothing. They have a ton of people. They should still be able to send another or even more after Renner's character and continue on with the movie, but no, can't do that. Running out of budget on the movie, no more money, and the movie can't be saved. Got to end it at that. Man, this movie bad. No, movie should just end like that and expect to be good.<br /><br />Save your money and watch something else!
B007GCY8FS|3.0|I've read all of the Reacher series and although they were entertaining, after a while they become somewhat predictable, as this one has been.  I've enjoyed all of Child's books and found them entertaining and fast reading. I hope to continue to read Childs' books because there is not much on TV that keeps me interested.  These books don't require much thought except to keep the characters straight.
B004JMY312|4.0|Loved it when I was younger ... still love it!  Bette Midler is great in her role,as well as Sarah Jessica Parker, & Kathy Najimy.  Great fun for the family.
B006PZBR8S|5.0|This movie is one of the best movies this year. The cast are fantastic in it. And it never stops from start to end. They did a great job on this one. Promise you will love it.
B000G8NY4U|5.0|The recording, both audio and video are superb.  This DVD is Yanni's best to date.  The audio is particularly done well with most of the instruments mixed to where they are heard.  Not all of his DVDs are recorded to this standard.
B005LAIGSC|3.0|This movie was not bad. It got kind of boring at times, but that's how cia/rogue agent movies are, but then some shootout or hand to hand combat scene will happen and spark the movie back up again. Of course denzel was great as usual and ryan played a good part, but every one new martial arts but him. He held his own though.  He was kind of a disappointment to me seeing as how he is supposed to reprise the roll of my boy deadpool next year, and deadpool knows every fighting style ever invented. But anyway aright movie worth a rental, but for me I'd only watch it one time so it won't be collection worthy.
B005KR6OBM|5.0|4 DVD's at a price you would normally pay for two. Could't be happier. Thank you, thank you, thank you.
0307474259|5.0|This is a must read for everyone. We have been following dietary advise from the so called experts to our demise- as it relates to weight management and nutrition. This book delves into the true determinants of why we get fat and provides a systematic pathway for what to do about it.  It's a long overdue treatise on nutrition that is well written and packed with evidence based research to substantiate his recommendations.
B0052VUNHC|5.0|For me this book had a great story to follow!  I really loved how their relationship was not rushed and the author took her time in creating a relationship between the main characters.  I really liked how Travis evolved, I got a little annoyed with how selfish Abby was but the rest of the storyline made up for that.  I have already preordered the next book telling the story from Travis's viewpoint.
B0083SBM7Q|2.0|Okay, I am a HUGE fan of Marvel Comics, the Marvel movie franchise, any of Joss Whedon's work, and of \\"The Avengers\\" in particular.  It is a stunning movie.  Truly.  That said...<br /><br />WARNING: IF YOU ONLY HAVE A DVD PLAYER, *all* of the special features are limited to the **Blu-ray disc only.**<br /><br />I purchased the 2-Disc Blu-ray/DVD Combo because, unlike the 1-disc DVD, it had all the special features.  But apparently I was misled.  Yes, that's right, on the DVD in this package (and, I assume, the 4-disc one as well), there are *NO* deleted scenes, no extended scenes, no gag reel, no \\"A Visual Journey\\" featurette, and none of the little easter eggs reputed to be hidden in the blu-ray menu.  And thanks to copyright laws, it takes hours to find any of these things online - some you can't find at all.<br /><br />I feel genuinely cheated.<br /><br />If I didn't want special features, I would have bought the 1-disc.  Thanks a lot, Marvel. >=[
B000JQUKKU|4.0|A classic that we've all seen on tv but it was really nice to read it - a quick read
1609611543|5.0|This is a must read for anyone wanting to learn about health and nutrition and what to do about it. Gluten is a toxin and this book illustrates why. I was blown away with the wealth of information that consistently highlights why the \\"heart healthy\\" multi whole grain is deleterious to our health and well being.
B000J2DAYM|2.0|Unfocused and clumsy, although the inversion of traditional noir themes carries it somewhat. Watch if you really like noir, or if you are in hight school, or perhaps even on a lark. I like to be dazzled, and the acting I found to be lacking.
B005K17RU0|5.0|this app tells you everything you need to know about the weather. daily and weekly views are excellent. I highly recommend this app.

B003VANOFY|5.0|This is my second pair of these.  I had to order new ones because the piece where the wire connects to the headset was broken, and they couldn't charge.  That pair lasted me over 2 years.  The only downside to these is the default software for them. It has complications running with some programs. The voices are neat at first, but it is easier to use windows rather than the sound software that comes with them.
B000JML7EC|4.0|Great to read this one - prolly would never hav bought I so getting on the free list at kindle was a great find
B0024F08UG|5.0|I have not seen this movie in 38 years. Back then it was on tv, which some of you know, was not that good. To me this is still one of the best disaster movies I've seen. It looks really good in Blu-Ray I was quite impressed. It definitely did not look this good the last time I saw it. It was also nice that it was in 2:35:1 aspect ratio. I can't really comment on the audio quality as I listen with external speakers hooked up to my fm tuner, which is in regular stereo sound. But it sounds good to me. This movie has a great cast & the color was really nice too. If you haven't seen this movie in a while, I think you would really like this Blu-Ray version.

If you like the RWS deck, you'll love the improvements in the Radiant version that make it much easier to see every detail. The colours are brighter and more vivid than the original and the universal decks which makes this far more \\"user friendly\\" to me. Great deal, beautiful cards.

B007TBZ63Y|5.0|Another masterpiece from Rick Riordan.  Every book this man writes is golden.  This may not be one with a happy ending but, it's still a great read.  For all those Lightning Thief fans this is part of the spin off from that series.  Our beloved characters Percy Jackson & Annabeth Chase are in it as well as new characters that we have met in the spin off series.  I love mythology however Riordan has a way to make me crave more of these stories.  He makes them adventurous and funny in parts as well, it's a good balance.

B007SGLZP8|4.0|I loved the book, particularly the afterword, where the very talented Grisham, acknowledges that he is a little lazy, did little research had has concocted a work of complete fiction.  I wish I had talent like that.<br /><br />The Racketeer has more twists and turns than a mountain highway, and there are few hints  in the pages that the tale is about to take another abrubt turn.  Toward the end, I was turning the pages, not to learn about the characters, their situation or their surroundings, but simply to find out what happens next.<br /><br />Becasue it is fiction, it all makes sense in the end, kind of, but also because it is so contrived, I am not sure we really care.<br /><br />It is interesting to read a story where the protagonist's actions are delivered straight, but SPOILER ALERT may not be exactly what they seem.<br /><br />Grisham has a great insight in to the criminal justice system and the various players in that system and I recognise many of the characters he discribes.  His plot depends on them playing true to type; and his resolution of it all is entertaining.<br /><br />I  can't wait for the movie.

044024367X|5.0|Twelfth in the Jack Reacher suspense series about an ex-M.P. roaming the world on his own terms and protecting the innocent.<br /><br />It's been ten years since he left the army.<br /><br />My Take<br />I think this was one of the scarier Reacher novels. To think that a town would exist that was so far out of the norm. And how easy it was for its \\"rulers\\" to govern! Part of that \\"easiness\\" depended upon how the majority of us were brought up: Keep out of your neighbors' business and follow the rules.<br /><br />The people in Hope know there's something hinky and they simply accommodate their nutty neighbors. Of course, to be fair, they had no idea that Despair was that crazy! It certainly helped Despair protect its way of doing things that the feds had an interest there!<br /><br />I would'a gone around the town after being tossed out on my butt. And the U.S. would be minus some pretty useful territory if I had been in charge and not Reacher.<br /><br />I don't understand why Child writes in the beginning that Reacher was \\"angry at himself later, for being so inflexible\\". Seems it was a good thing! And just the type of action Reacher is good at, so, I'm confused.<br /><br />Reacher worries me. He's getting older and he still plunges into some scary situations! Although, I do love how Child provides us with a step-by-step of how Reacher plans to thwart the bad guys! He does do some rather stupid things in this story. Makes me wonder what's gonna happen in [[ASIN:0345541588 Gone Tomorrow (Jack Reacher, #13)]] .<br /><br />Oh, lordy, Reacher has weaknesses! He can't run very fast. He's a terrible driver. Here I was beginning to think he was Superman.<br /><br />It's a busy story. There is so much going on and Child keeps it pretty hidden until the end. Oh, there are plenty of clues and loads of red herrings, but I remained pretty clueless about most of it.<br /><br />The Story<br />Jack Reacher had a new plan in mind---crossing the country diagonally from Maine to San Diego. There was just this little hiccup with the guy and the comfy Grand Marquis. Then there was the little town of Despair, Colorado, that threw him out. Nuh-uh, nobody keeps Jack Reacher from going where he pleases and it's game on.<br /><br />The heady delights of power and the crazed interpretation of the Rapture has created a despotic mayor---he's more of a king, really---in Despair.

B00009P1O0|5.0|Easily one of Neil's 5 best. Something from all of Neil's various musical personalities at the time can be found here. country fans will dig &#34;See the sky about to rain&#34;  with Ben Keith's awesome pedal steel licks along with the banjo-driven &#34;for the turnstiles.&#34; The chugging guitar rock of crazy horse is well-represented here with &#34;revolution blues&#34; & &#34;walk on.&#34; acoustic folk shows up on the somewhat bitter & semi-autobiographical &#34;motion pictures.&#34; there's also a protest song--&#34;vampire blues&#34;-- which, as the title suggests, is not folk but a rare, though very well done, stab at a basic blues song. The sound is fantastic. Crosby, Nash & members of the Band, along with Crazy horse, all make contributions to a criminally neglected masterpiece. Baffling why this took so long to come out on cd. Neil's golden period started with his self-titled debut & continued on all the way through the end of the seventies with Rust Never Sleeps.&#34; You can't go wrong with any of them.
0316228532|1.0|A depressing read.  It took forever to get into the story such as it is.  Character and character is introduced.  There was no one to like or care about.  I finally started skimming the book and was glad when I looked at the end that I hadn't wasted anymore time on it.  I wasn't expecting Harry Potter but a good exciting adult read.  I can't decide whether to donate the book or trash it.
B000NQRE1E|5.0|Titanic, newly released from Paramount Pictures on Blu-Ray/3D and digital, didn't completely sweep the Academy Awards in 1998 - it only took 11 of the Oscar statuettes! Among them: Best Picture, a Best Director for James Cameron and a Best Cinematography for Russell Carpenter.  Some of that sweeping cinematography is bound to be lost on a home screen, but home surround-sound can do a nice job on its Oscar-winning Best Sound.<br /><br />Seasoned KIDS FIRST! Film Critic Raven D calls Titanic a \\"romantic masterpiece.\\" The film evokes strong emotion partly because of the real-life tragedy it recreates but also thanks to the intimate love story Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet bring to life. That the film is 15 years old does not diminish its impact. Says Raven, \\"... even though I've seen it about a billion times, I still get choked up.\\" On a scale of one to five, she rates it a five only because higher numbers aren't available.<br /><br />Titanic<br />Reviewed by Raven D, KIDS FIRST! Film Critic<br />Video reviews may be found at kidsfirst dot org<br /><br />Titanic is my favorite movie by far. This romantic masterpiece starring Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet tells a tale of love, loss and tragedy. I remember the first time I watched Titanic. I was 7 years old, and I've been hooked ever since. This was the first film that really made me cry, and even though I've seen it about a billion times, I still get choked up.<br /><br />This movie is beautifully done. I love that the cinematography is so grand and breathtaking even though the film came out in 1997. I especially love the way they capture the Titanic in all its glory. I'm a total history geek when it comes to the Titanic. I've seen every documentary and read every book there is to read about the Titanic, so the fact that they used actual footage of the wreckage of Titanic was really cool.<br /><br />My favorite characters are Rose and Jack, of course! They defy the rules of their different social statuses and are in true love. Not only are those characters great, but Kate and Leonardo do a masterful job in these roles. I love the whole movie, but my favorite scene would have to be when Rose and Jack are running through the ship away from the butler after the drawing scene. It lightens the mood of the film before the sinking and is quite funny. Plus, you almost get a mini tour of the ship. I also admire the final few scenes in which the ship is sinking. The way it is captured is amazing. It's the perfect mix of chaos and emotion, which really conveys the tragedy in a brilliant way.<br /><br />Like I said, this film is very tragic, and that fact that it was an actual event makes it even more sad. I would recommend this film for all ages, even though it is sad and slightly inappropriate. I watched it when I was 7 and nothing bothered me. This is a must-see movie, and I give it five out of five stars. I'd give it more if I could!

B0099116AY|5.0|Reviewed by KIDS FIRST! Film Critic, Victoria B, KIDS FIRST! Film Critic.<br /><br />I went to see this movie with my mom and she was freaking out and covering my eyes in some parts, I thought it was funny and that she was overreacting.  After the movie I had to remind her that I am fourteen.  This movie is about a married couple of thirty-one years, Kay (played by Merryl Streep) and Arnold (played by Tommy Lee Jones) who love each other so much, but have not been affectionate or intimate with each other in many years.  They even sleep in separate rooms, and on anniversaries they get gifts not for each other, but for the house.  Kay gets sad at the reality that she and her husband do not have a real relationship.  So she gets a book about marriage and calls the couple's counselor and schedules the intense therapy to fix her marriage.  At first Arnold refuses to go, but then reconsiders when Kate leaves without him, then reluctantly he goes with her because he does not want to lose her.  All throughout the movie Arnold is uncomfortable with therapy, and especially the intimate tasks assigned by Dr. Fields (played by Steve Carrell).  While Kay really wants to have a \\"real\\" relationship, Arnold is tentative and they battle with this throughout the whole movie.  This movie was very sweet in a weird way because it is based around an older and very in love couple that struggles with intimacy and I guess for a young audience, that visual would gross them out.  The soundtrack in this movie reminded me of music in a silent film because music is included in most scenes and they describe the scene, even if the words are not there.  Tommy Lee Jones is very versatile as an actor.  I have never seen him play a domestic character or anyone in a relationship, it is refreshing and he does a great job.  This movie makes me see the power in love and determination to sustain it.  My mother was shocked by some scenes but then laughed, so this would be a great movie for couples who are in a long relationship.  This is a very intriguing movie, I have not seen many with this concept, so I give it five out of five stars.  I recommend this movie for mature 13-year-olds and up. This is a good movie for a mature crowd.<br /><br />Video reviews available at kidsfirst dot orgn a long relationship.

B009AMAKSQ|5.0|Summit Entertainment's latest film, based on the novel written by Stephen Chbosky, profiles a 15-year-old Charlie (Logan Lerman), an endearing and naive outsider, who is coping with first love (Emma Watson), the suicide of his best friend, and his own mental illness while struggling to find a group of people with whom he belongs. This introvert freshman is taken under the wings of two seniors, Sam and Patrick, who welcome him to the real world. You should be aware that this film was originally rated R by the MPAA for \\"teen drug and alcohol use, and some sexual references\\" but was later changed to PG-13 after an appeal for \\"mature thematic material, drug and alcohol use, sexual content including references, and a fight - all involving teens.\\" Our 14-year-old KIDS FIRST! Film Critic, Victoria Burns, found this film to be the \\"best she has ever seen\\" and noted that \\"this movie can prepare teens to not keep emotions and experiences bottled up because school can be painful and stressful.\\" Below is her review.<br /><br />The Perks of Being a Wallflower<br />reviewed by Victoria Burns<br />Video Review here [...]<br />I can honestly say that it was one of, if not the best movie that I have ever seen.  It was so pivotal that it almost made me cry, and that says a lot because I almost never cry.  It was great to see a movie that beautifully showed some of the struggles that real teenagers go through and not sugar coated.<br /><br />This movie is very emotional and has great acting.  I like the way  the flashback scenes are shown, by alternating from the present to the past, then showing the aftermath after the flashbacks.  I had never seen Emma Watson in anything but the Harry Potter series, and she is amazing playing Sam, I have never seen her play a character like this.<br /><br />The movie is so good that no words can explain. I bought the book directly after I watched the movie.  I also love how throughout the whole movie most of the story is told by Charlie (Logan Lerman) who writes letters anonymously to \\"A Friend\\" who doesn't exist.<br /><br />This movie is about a severely depressed and lonely boy, Charlie, whose best friend killed himself before the school year starts. So now Charlie has no friends and people think he is weird because he holds in and takes the pain of himself and all of the people he loves, sometimes it all wells up and he has anxiety attacks.  This year he is determined to make friends and he meets the flamboyant Patrick (Ezra Miller), and his stepsister Sam (Emma Watson). They let him in and introduce him to a whole new world filled with fun, sadness, and just plain life. Plus, he falls in love with Sam along the way.  All of Charlie's friends are seniors, and he makes a mistake that makes them go away for a while. But then he does something to make them love him even more than before.<br /><br />I think that everyone should watch this movie. I like how, whenever something bad or slightly inappropriate happens in the flashbacks, the scene hints at what was happening without blatantly showing what happened.  My favorite quote from the movie is when Charlie's English teacher, Mr. Anderson (Paul Rudd) tells him that, \\"We accept the love we think we deserve.\\" I think it is so profound and absolutely true.  I recommend this movie for eighth graders going into high school up to any adult.  This movie can prepare teens to not keep emotions and experiences bottled up because school can be painful and stressful.  I give it five out of five stars because this movie is amazing and will someday be a classic.\\"A Friend\\" who doesn't exist.

B008JFUUIA|5.0|Laughs is what sets this \\"misfit saves the day\\" singing movie apart from other teen and/or singing movies. Laughs and a satiric wit ably presented by an engaging cast. KIDS FIRST! Film Critic Victoria B, calls it \\"surprisingly really funny\\" and says she intends to watch it over again - which is also surprising as she shares that this type of movie is not usually one that's for her.<br /><br />Pitch Perfect<br />Reviewed by Victoria B<br />Video reviews may be found at kidsfirst dot org<br /><br />I went to see Pitch Perfect and it is surprisingly really funny. I do not usually like musical types of movies, but this one was one of the best.<br /><br />At first I thought that this movie would be one of the ones with random outbreaks of song, but this movie has a nice storyline and it is funny. The singing is amazing. Plus, since the move is about an a capella group, it is interesting and kind of impressive to see the actors make the track to the music with their voices.<br /><br />This movie is about Beca (Anna Kendrick), a girl who wants more than anything to be a music producer but her dad makes her go to college first. Finally, her dad says that if she goes to college for a year, joins a club and really tries her best, he will let her drop out and go to California. This gives her some incentive to do well in school and join the Barden Bellas, the school's all-girl a capella group.<br /><br />The Bellas' arch rival is the all-boys group, the Trebles. Beca starts to fall for a member of the Trebles, Jesse (Skylar Astin), which is forbidden by the Bellas' uptight leader, Aubrey (played by Anna Camp). The Bellas are old-fashioned and Beca is tired of it so she quits, then she rejoins and makes the Bellas better than ever, new, and ready to win. Whether they win against the Trebles is a mystery that you'll have to watch to find out.<br /><br />I love this movie, and the characters are very eclectic to say the least. My favorite character is Fat Amy because she's hilarious and says whatever is on her mind, and it shows because she calls herself \\"Fat\\" Amy. I absolutely love this movie and will definitely be watching it repeatedly.<br /><br />I give it five out of five stars because I like that the actors can sing well, and the way that they make the music track with their voices is amazing. I recommend this movie for anyone who likes music and comedy, because together it is a great combination. I like that the movie is not just about the singing and that it has a good storyline as well. I recommend this movie for ages mature 12 and up because the movie has some foul language but overall is a good movie.us and says whatever is on her mind, and it shows because she calls herself \\"Fat\\" Amy.

0345803485|3.0|I was not going to jump on the Fifty Shades bandwagon. It kept popping up on the top if the list for Kindle, however, so I finally broke down and decided to at least read some reviews. Well the reviews I read were all 1-3 stars. Ok. Did I really want to spend ten bucks on a mediocre book? Nope.<br />Most of the low star reviews stated exactly what I'm going to.<br />*There is a lot(!!!) of repetition in the descriptions of things. For example,  Ana biting her lip or Grey's long fingers. I completely understand the need to insert these descriptions in the book, but I don't understand the need to repeat them. Okay we get it. He has long fingers. I'll keep that in mind while playing out the book in my head.<br />*Characters murmer or mumble or something all the time. Even when the situation doesn't call for it. They can't just talk like normal people? This is mildly annoying, as I like to envision the book as a movie in my head so when I read murmur, I<br />see a character talking slightly under their breath or talking low, almost to themselves.(as most everyone would I imagine)<br /><br />As for the reviews about all the orgasms or quickness of said orgasms and Ana referring to her parts as 'down there',  this really does happen in real life I promise. Same for her constantly blushing/flushing a few different shades of red. I do the blushing thing and I'm 31. Men find it adorable. I think it's embarrassing. *shrug*<br /><br />So how did I end up buying this book? Well after the reviews I decided to download the free sample and see how badly irritated I became from reading it.<br />It wasn't irritating enough for me not to buy it. I do wish it was around the five dollar range though. I'd consider that a fair price for a new author. Most all of the books I buy are from new authors or authors I haven't heard of. I like to try new things. The only thing my entire Kindle library has in common - all the books are from the romance section. Well except the 1 book about Havanese. But the other 250+ are romance. Anything from mild teen versions to scalding hot seriously kinky sex on the first page<br />versions.<br />Fifty Shades, book one, rates a 6 or 7 in steamyness in my eyes.<br /><br />So I say go for it if you have a spare ten bucks laying around begging to get tied up into a bank account so your long fingers can depress that little yellow purchase now button while your tooth bites your bottom lip.<br />If nothing else, you'll get a glimpse into a world of fun that is non vanilla sex!se.

B008WCP2PG|1.0|Well, I bought it, I saw it, and it is not worth it.  After all the hype on TV, I though this was a movie that was well going to be worth the effort to purchase.  WELL, IT AIN'T, it is one of the most boring pictures based on a strip tease that I have ever seen.  I regret purchasing it, and I can assure you that I will not keep it.  I could say where is the magic in \\"Magic Mike\\", I didn't see anything that would allow me to recommend it to anyone at all.
B009QW7HMC|5.0|Fun to watch, greatly enjoyed the series. I highly recommend those who like this genre, it will engage you with every turn and twist as it progresses.
B008KEQM3W|5.0|Inspired by the perennial New York Times bestseller of the same name, What To Expect When You're Expecting is a hilarious and heartfelt big screen comedy about five couples whose intertwined lives are turned upside down by the challenges of impending parenthood. Rated PG-13 for crude and sexual content, thematic elements and language, one of our KIDS FIRST! youth film critics, Raven Devanney (age 14) reviewed it this week and \\"laughed through this whole movie!\\" Here's her review:<br />What To Expect When You're Expecting<br />Review by Raven D, KIDS FIRST! Film Critic<br /><br />What To Expect When You're Expecting completely met my expectations. It's the hilarious comedy that follows five couples on their way to becoming parents. It features the wonderful talent of Chris Rock, Cameron Diaz, Elizabeth Banks and many other A-listers.<br /><br />I laughed through this whole movie! The comedy is on point and hilarious and the acting is fantastic. I love that it is from the perspective of many different couples who have different stories and views on what they are going through.<br /><br />My favorite character is Wendy, played by Elizabeth banks, because she has such an organized plan of how her pregnancy and labor will go but she ends up having an extremely difficult pregnancy. She tries to pull herself together, but she falls apart and it is hilarious.<br /><br />My favorite scene is actually when Wendy has her breaking point. It's so funny! I also love that they have the dad's club in this movie because it shows the wacky perspective of a father on parenting and all of the dad scenes made me laugh so hard my stomach hurt.<br /><br />I suggest this movie for ages 13 and up because of mature content and language. Overall I give What To Expect When You're Expecting  5 out of 5 stars.

1426209584|5.0|For those of us who have been following the BoP's for years, this book is the perfect complement to the BBC documentaries made and the books written on what I truly believe are the most fascinating animals on Earth. The pictures and text are way beyond anything I have seen before (and I must say, have quite a collection of material on these birds). At first sight, some of the pictures seem surreal (the page 2 Greater Bird of Paradise's shot from the canopy on Wokam, Aru Islands, is, by itself, worth the money spent on this book) and impossible to take, but just reading about all the years of hard work it took Mr. Laman, Mr. Scholes and his collaborators to complete these masterpiece,  one can truly understand what an amazing contribution this book is to and to future generations who love nature at its best. I have already bought a copy for a friend and plan to buy more for other friends because I believe the lives of these amazing creatures need to be learned by as many people as possible. I can not think of a better gift to show people that we human beings are just a tiny part of the animal kingdom, and that many animals are as fascinating as us. As a client of many years of Amazon.com, this is the first review I have ever written, but this book is also the most exciting item I have ever bought in the site, and totally worth a few praising words.<br />Jose,<br />Brooklyn, New York
B009KHDT0C|4.0|I have seen Johnny do a lot better work but for the theme of this movie I think it was good.  There were some wtf moments and sometimes the movie felt like it paused on certain scenes when they were not important or rushed through more fun ones.  Over all though everyone should at least rent it.  I will not be running out to buy this one though.
B0077SGMXM|5.0|Super addicting is what it should be called. So simple yet so freaking addicting, You need to try it! Dont listen to the haters on this one.
B0051UH6W4|5.0|I found this book difficult to read the first time round. The clever writing style, moving backwards and forwards in time and the unfamiliar Indian names made it a challenge.  But having read it once I have kept going back for more, it is so cleverly written you glean more and more every time you re-read it.  A very sad and moving book, highlighting the Indian class system and it's injustices.  If you are having doubts as to whether to finish it or give up on the way, I would recommend you persevere as it really is a very satisfying read.
B005WUHAX8|1.0|I returned it.  It did not work. I contacted LifeProof and they said it was not an original it was missing certain things.
B009NPKTN6|5.0|I had a great time watching this 1987 musical!  You will sing along and have a lot of fun laughing at the comedy if you lived/grew up in the 80's. My husband is not a fan of musicals, so I didn't tell him until the show started, but he even admitted it was great.
B000JMKTLO|4.0|I really enjoyed this book and would recommend it to anyone who likes a good mystery.  Ms. Flynn develops her characters well, so you have a good feel for what makes them tick.  Well written.
B000063UR1|5.0|Yes, it is dated in places, but how well do you think Avatar will hold up in 40 years?  The opening sequence and closing scene in \\"Silent Running\\" are worth the tour alone, in my opinion.  I give it 5 stars for it's enduring quality of being endearing.  Camp?  Yes, there's some. But watching Bruce Dern teach his robot friends how to play poker to help pass the time is good stuff, no doubt.  This is 100% Space Hippie Perfection :P  Recommended.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|Got this app from amazon for my Kindle Fire.  Works well and it's fun. A little annoying when you get to the ones that have more spaces than needed to make all the connections, because you have to fill up all the spaces anyway, but still fun. Helps the time go by if you have to be waiting somewhere!
B000L53D4O|5.0|Got this for a friends baby that was starting to walk and she loved it. Now my daughter is about to be walking and she gave it to use. It's a great toy.
B008N5UX9M|4.0|If you are a Maiden fan (let's be real, who's not?) and are headed into this expecting something even remotely resembling a Maiden record, you will be sorely disappointed. Knowing that Steve was a huge classic British Rock fan, that was what I expected going in and I don't think that is what this album is either. To be honest it seems more like a bunch of left over stuff from the last 20 years that was way to light to be on a Maiden record. I am very suprised that these songs were even written by Steve. They just don't seem to resemble anything you have ever heard from Steve before. Maybe after I hear it a million times my opinion might change a bit, but for now I am shocked at how Un-Maiden like this is. I guess after just about 40 years, you don't expect new tricks from an old dog.
B0029XFNA8|5.0|we have quite a few Christmas movies that we rotate and watch each season, this is an old favorite I added to our collection.

B008HOR7VQ|5.0|Knopfler has to be one of the most underated songwriters of our time. He is 35 years into a career that continues to produce excellent music. This CD is absolutely BRILLIANT  !!!!!!!!!!
B0086700CM|5.0|An excellent game, and best of all is free. It is very easy to play. I hardly play game,  but I love to play this game.
B005HEUXQA|4.0|It's a good episode, but it's just a bit slow. It does pick up at the end, especially with the little surprise that Barclay does during the transportor fix they were carrying out.<br /><br />What makes this episode is Reginald Barclay, a Starfleet officer who stutters, suffers from anxiety, and is a social awkward mess. You'd think that in 200 years people would have \\"cured\\" these sort of things, but that's what makes Star Trek special--it's about the things that makes us human. So it starts out with Barclay's irrational fear of transport (akin to today's fear of flying). While this premise is a of a steal from Dr. McCoy's character (he hated transporting), it works well into the story since Barclay experiences something very real but he fears no one will believe him. And as usual, Captain Picard shows his care for all his crew, and orders this mystery solved. Also, Geordi shows that he cares about those under his command as well.<br /><br />Good episode, just doesn't make a top 10 TNG list, though Barclay's character is very memorable and important in the ST universe.
B000SEGUDE|5.0|There are few books i wish i could read again for the first time:  Cloud Atlas is such a book.  It is a direct antithesis to \\"Atlas Shrugged\\" which i loved as a young person but about which i now am more aware of what the philosophy would mean to real people. Cloud Atlas is a strong book with meaningful characters and lays out what we can expect if we choose corporate America instead of an America that cares for all its citizens.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Love it! I am so glad they didn't give up on eachother! I could feel the passion between<br />them and loved the way he responded to her every need.
B007MB5OCE|1.0|Maybe if I knew more about history, this book would have been interesting....instead, I fell asleep most of the time reading it and never even finished it.
B004DMIIVO|5.0|This story is nothing far from our technology days, actually we are dependents of the Internet, that's the reason why this story can be possible, I hope don't occurs but it's possible...!
140132634X|2.0|Mitch Albom has always had the gift to make a reader cry about some form of humanity...this one missed the mark.  I'm disappointed I didn't get my cry:(
B007IXWL2C|4.0|This installment of the Fifty Shades series focused more on the development of the characters and how they came to be the way they are. A very interesting read that answered a lot of questions that were raised by the two previous books.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|I like how each character has to find their own way and form new friendships while learning from each other.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|The Hunger Games series were a great and easy read! I could not put them down!! I do not understand why people compare it to Twilight, though, other than both being good reads, they are nothing a like. I thought hat the story line was original and interesting. I will suggest to all my friends.
B009GEBBNQ|4.0|I enjoyed this a lot. I was a casual comic book fan back when I was a kid, but let that wane.  I enjoyed the preceding movies of the Iron Man, Captain America, and Thor. They have all been fun. This one didn't disappoint.
B005J2UM9S|4.0|I've been waiting for a \\"scary\\" movie... this one was pretty good! It actually had some jump out at you and creepy scenes, which I prefer. I'd probably watch it again, and have already recommended it to others.

0525425764|5.0|Grisham doesn't disappoint.  He can write for young adults as well as his always popular books for adult readers.  \\"Teddy\\" Boone is an only child of lawyer/parents, and like many only children, he is very mature for his age and is looked up to by his peers as well as kids his own age.  In this book, he is accused of a crime he didn't commit (he is the prime suspect by the polie) and he has to figure out who is framing him (why would someone frame a 13 year old with no known enemies?).  With the help of his uncle, a former lawyer who has been disbarred, they manage to bring the culprit(s) to justice.  There are also 2 other Boone books in this series; I recommend all of them - you do not have to read them in any special order; each one stands alone.  Finally, this is a great book, written by a great author, for readers of all ages.  Happy reading!
B003VANOFY|5.0|I wish I played games but am too addicted to them!!! However, I use the headset because I like the wireless capability to be able to walk away from the PC when either listening or speaking. The sound is great and you can hear the sound from behind as well as all around... i.e. the 7.1 surround... The battery lasts a very long time (maybe a day?). It's a little bit heavy if wanting a office wireless setup, but otherwise is great. I especially like the volume \\"roll\\" button on the side. Thanks!
B008ROH07W|5.0|The natural trumpet is a pig of an instrument to play. Its intonation is insecure, it requires a lot of puff and it's all lips and tongue. No wonder trumpeters were the musical royalty of their day, seated on platforms slightly higher than the other musicians, and with their lines at the top of the score, along with the other \\"royal\\" instrument, the drums. The scary thing is that Alison Balsom makes it all sound soooo easy - no parps, no toots, immaculate silvery tone, sublime runs, flawless trills, simply astounding. The music is, appropriately, all music of the baroque period, some of it adapted, and with an occasional vocal soloist. Ms. Balsom is ably accompanied by The English Concert and its old concertmaster Trevor Pinnock, and few know better how to handle baroque than these, among the stalwarts of HIP. A thoroughly enjoyable record.
B009NQKPUW|4.0|If you are looking for a movie that keeps you on your toes, this is one that will certainly do it. The first 15 minutes are slow, but hold on as the CGI and live action kick in. Defiantly not for children. I don't want to say to much about it as I don't want to ruin it. Buy the movie. You will want to watch it again and again...That is, if you are a fan of these types of movies.
B00881VLCE|4.0|enjoy the selection of scenes, nicely presented.  it could be created to be more challenging.<br />tried to purchase a set of puzzles but it wouldn't go through.
B0090EIILU|4.0|There aren't too many new comedies out there that get a laugh out of me but I thought this movie was hilarious
B0086700CM|5.0|Once you start playing its hard to stop. all my friends kids love to play it and its almost always the first thing they ask to do.
B003M5AXN4|5.0|The story is interesting enough to be entertaining.  The visuals a feast for the eyes.  I love this movie. Two thumbs up to Susan Sarandon and Christina Ricci.
B000H6SXMY|3.0|The DVDs are old, so the picture quality is not good and sometimes they skip or have little blips. I wish this product wasn't so old!
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Sylvia Day did it again with Reflected in You: A Crossfire Novel. I can't wait for the third book in this series, I am so glad that I don't have to wait long. I saw that it will be out on Dec. 31st! This book keeps you guessing with some major twists and turns and it leaves you wanting to know \\"What happens next?\\"
B004S9AK3G|5.0|Absolutely rivetting reading, incredible plot with such wonderful detail! World without end is a step back into a time in history where the church and it's clergy had all the power and they didn't always use it for the good of their townspeople add to that the Plague which decimated the population of England and Europe and you have an amazing story! So enjoyable and highly recommended!
B007THA4FI|3.0|Enjoyed reading this book, but I really found that there were too many characters, and sometimes it was very hard to remember who was who. However an enjoyable read
B0063IH60K|5.0|Very quick response. Easy to play. Yes there are ads but that's the price for free stuff. And they can be skipped with a quick tap. Only problem ...it's addictive.
B00992CF6W|5.0|If you cant download or install this app, or if your creations suddenly disappear, CONTACT CUSTOMER SUPPORT. Noone is trying to &quot;rip you off&quot;. They have customer support for these reasons.<br /><br />If you're complaining about the price (you know, that whopping $6.99), GET A JOB. Maybe mow a lawn, walk some dogs, clean someones garage etc. I'm fairly certain the physical labor won't kill you and then you can buy this app.<br /><br />See, I'm a problem solver. You're welcome!
0316228532|3.0|Until the end, this book was great. It had a sizable amount of characters all of which are relatable, though not likable. I have to admit that reading this book was very enjoyable to me, in the same way that watching an MTV reality show becomes a guilty pleasure. You got to become engaged in all of the characters' lives and knew what their motives were. Though dark, this book contained a concise yet well thought out world that was great to escape the mundane outer world.<br /><br />The ending, however was not an ending. Except for the characters that were killed, we are given no real resolution to any of the plots. Gaia and Andrew seem to be getting to know each other better, but are they going to hook up? Who is/was Krystal's father? Will the addiction clinic shit down? And many other aspects to the plot are brought out to make you think you'll get an answer if you keep reading, but they are never answered. The ending of the book feels more like an ending to one of the book's parts(there are 7 I think) than a conclusive stop. I'm not sure if there will be a &#34;The Casual Vacancy 2&#34; given the critical reception of the book, but there definitely needs to be.<br /><br />This book is definitely charming, and the writing is some of the Author's finest. I feel that this book gave me new insight into the world, and I am very appreciative of that.<br /><br />A definite negative is the book's superfluous sexual diversions. They are completely extraneous to the plot, and seem just to be a way to divert from the Author's previous work for children. A good example is a passage where it says that Andrew and Fats view Internet pornography together. Then she tries to explain every aspect of porn that the teens have viewed, in graphic detail. I'm not prude, but these aspects of the book gave me a definite disgust reaction.
B009VB97EY|3.0|Obviously, this is not going to win an Oscar, but I definitely found it entertaining and worth the rental fee.  There has been a lot of criticism of the acting, but I have to say this was the best I have seen from Channing Tatum.  I love his movies because, let's be honest, he is nice to look at, but I have never felt he was a great actor.  In this movie, I saw a talent from him that I never saw before.  Channing aside, I really enjoyed this movie.  It's not very often that there are practically naked men all through a movie. :)  Also, how often are we going to see Matthew McConaughey walking around in a black thong with tassels.
0316228532|5.0|Another great story from a wonderful storyteller! While The Causal Vacancy has a very different writing style and plot then from J.K. Rowling's Harry Potter series, it holds it own! I was captured from the minute I picked it up and had I not had to work early the next morning I would have probably stayed up all night to finish! As always her characters are very well developed and nothing disappoints! I hope you enjoy this book as much as I did.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I really really like the movie.  This led me to purchase The Hunger Games Trilogy.  I have read it once and now I'm reading it again.  I'm really pleased how closely the movie follows the book and I'm certainly looking forward to the next movies because Catching Fire to be followed by Mockingjay complete the entire story.  You just can't let this one go after Katniss and Peeta win the Hunger Games and return home.  Catching Fire and Mockingjay give you, as Paul Harvey used to say, \\"The rest of the story.\\"<br /><br />I have the Kindle version of trilogy and it is hard to put it down.  I love what Suzanne Collins has done from start to finish and will certainly be looking for more of her work.<br /><br />May the odds be ever in your favor!<br /><br />JP
B008JMKN4Y|2.0|Started out ok BUT it dragged!! I didn't but the \\"romance\\" of the two main characters and the main female character was SOOO VERY ANNOYING actually all of the females in this book were annoying...I rolled my eyes so much in this book that it gave me a headache!! I couldn't even finish it cause I lost intrest mid way...it felt like I reading a horribly written Lifetime Movie about codependent relationships....
0345803507|4.0|The book was interesting. I read the trilogy of 50 Shades and could not put it down. I am waiting for the author E.L. James to write another book.
B004QX07G4|2.0|This typical Ellen humor and she does a really good job of relaying her weird ideas. She however gave me a couple good laughs and I guess that was what I was going for by buying the book. If anybody wants light reading material this is the book for you because no thinking required.....
B008X9Z37A|4.0|Good protective, simple coverage which is exactly what I was after. No frills. Just a nice looking cover to keep my kindle fire in.
B0083DJUMA|5.0|Must read for anyone worried about stagnation in the economy. This book was a great read and is a testimony to the power of creativity and capitalism creating new industry and processes. Right under our noses this new exciting industry is being born and with it will come jobs, manufacturing , wealth creation. Yet another industry being democratized by technology will create new winners and losers. Putting the means of creating and manufacturing  in the hands of the masses is a powerful an wonderful thought. Must read for anyone who wants to see a light at the end of the tunnel of the drudgery that has been the economy. American ingenuity is alive and well (and the govt didn't even subsidize imagine that).  Great book.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|Awesome movie!  So much action going on in addition to Loki's scheming.  All the heroes are well played and I prefer Mark Rufalo's character of David Banner better than Edward Norton's.
B009GEBBNQ|5.0|I am a fan of all the Marvel comics/movies. They have a strong sense of patriotism and morality that is rare in Hollywood today. This movie was no exception. Love the Good vs Evil aspect of all of these stories, but the real charm is seeing how the characters evolve and become better people as they work together to once again save the world. I'm a sci-fi person and have found good movies in this genre very rare lately with the constant influx of horror and obscenities. The Marvel movies always leave me wanting more and looking forward to the sequel. Enjoy!!
B007SYWFRM|4.0|This game is addicting and really fun! I love how the animals look exactly like the ones in the movie! Ive earned what? 150 acorns for free just playing the mini game. It gets a little glitchy sometimes though. When I'm redecorating my village the only problem is that when I select the path you have to put it down one path at a time! That gets really annoying! And it takes a while to load! BUT THIS IS A AWESOME GAME! WOULD RECOMMEND TO ALL AGES!
B004M20YDU|5.0|The songs on this are all fantastic remixes of the originals.  These have more of a house influence on many of the tracks.  I can't listen to this enough.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|This series has captivated me, as much as Fifty Shades did. The characters are flawed and fascinating. Their progressing relationship has me addicted to their story. I loved the first book, and this one even more. I can't wait for the third novel to come out.
B008XNZMOU|5.0|i love this album<br />its amazing<br />it calms me<br />relieves stress<br />ignore this part i just wanted to give a 5 star rating for this amazing artist<br />but it makes me put twenty words<br />five starssssssssss

0062127241|3.0|Is it possible that one of the most influential musicians of the last 50 years can take us on a 500 page journey  and reveal so little of himself?  Factually, this is a great resource for any Who fan and will serve as a Who timeline as to who did what with who and when.<br />Perhaps it is not possible for the fan as reader to be moved by a chronology on paper the way its author was able to move millions with his songwriting, voice and guitar...but it is the purpose of a memoir.  Regardless, we owe Pete more than he owes us, even if this is a crummy read.  I feel like I just spent the last 2 days reading a wire transfer between Pete and his accountant, Pete and his real estate agent, Pete and his yacht broker... Learned a lot, felt very little. Well, a little sad at times for poor Pete...glad he's alive to tell the tale...<br />If nothing else, the monotonous tone of Who I am sets the stage for how hard Pete Townsend worked.  Love the music.  Respect the work ethic.  Pity the man.
B006VFLIYK|5.0|It was my first David Baldacci book, I really enjoyed the suspense and details, as a normal reader of romance novels I really wanted<br />it to have a happy ending for him.  I just finished my second  book Zero Day and enjoyed that also.
B006LSZECO|2.0|A good read  until the end --what happened --you left me without any story--  any feelings I had for the characters simply vanished.  I was MAD  I felt that I had wasted time reading a nothing book.  I will review any future books I purchase.  I could not wait until I could delete it from my Kindle.
B0091THDOM|1.0|I read a lot of positive reviews on this product and thus bought it for my new iphone5. However, the case is WAY to tight for the phone, that is impossible to pull the phone out once inserted. The case left me no choice but to cut the rim of the case itself to get my phone out. Very unpleased about the product. The leather finishes and stuff are nice, but its worth nothing if I can't put my phone in it.
B000RWDX9Q|5.0|The best thing that you can say about any movie is that after you finish watching it the first time you immediately want to see it again.  That is The Prestige.  An under-rated masterpiece.
B007IXWL2C|3.0|Ok, book one was compelling and different, book two started to wear on me and book three was just too much. The repetitive descriptives (lip biting and head tilting and shy smiling) just got old old old. I do think that the story itself was good but had wished the writer would have stopped after several lip bites and come up with something new or stopped feeling the need to be so descriptive with the same stuff again and again. I read all three because I never quit a story. Despite my annoyance..I did feel it all came together, but could have been one book.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Once I got past the explicit details of book, it was a true love story with examples of how a man gave everything for the one he truly loved.  It also represented the female having so much love that she was able to get past his confusing and somewhat troubled past.
B004US4K2C|5.0|I have tries so many launcher and always home back to Go Launcher Ex.  It is very easy to use and so many free go apps love it.

B007N85POS|5.0|[[ASIN:B004SBS8LA Angry Birds Rio (Ad-Free)]]<br />I enjoy playing all the Angry Birds but I think I like this one slightly better than the others.  I will admit that there is a certain amount of frustration from having to give up at some point because I can't get past a level. Enjoy the fun with any of the Angry Birds.
B007Q0OV6Q|3.0|I purchased this set for my son because he has had lego advent calendars for the past few years and loves them.  This year was no different.  He saw the set at a local store and went nuts over the Santa Darth Maul and R2-D2 snowman.  However, the price was outrageous and we did not buy it at the store.  Luckily for my son Amazon knocked 7 bucks off the price tag for it's customers and I had a $15 gift card from work that I used to make the total price right around $30 which is what this set is really worth.  So in a nutshell... a 5-star product knocked down to 3-stars because of price gouging.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|does what it advertises. I don't have a way to test to see if its calibrations are 100% correct but they appear to be.
B0055SWM08|5.0|The music is great,  the puzzles are fun &amp; challenging,  but the backstory is really what grabbed me. The game is set in a ( presumably)  older couple's home,  and and the use of symbols like the male/female symbols and rings in the puzzles kept me curious.<br />In the &quot;extras&quot; section they reveal a bit of the story,  which really only adds to the intrigue...<br /><br />...but when you finish the game you get an answer. In a way.<br /><br />All this just adds another layer to the already great game.
B009KHDT0C|4.0|I have fond memories of watching this all the time when I was a kid!<br />This movie was good but I guess I was expecting more.
B0052RE4MQ|3.0|It's OK - the writing is formulaic, predictable.  The vocabulary and descriptions are about a middle school level. It is a page turner, and reads quickly.  I hope the third book is better.
0385344333|4.0|Having read all of Child's Reacher series, I did not feel this one was as good a many earlier earlier ones.  Some good lines but, all in all, Child did not inject the humor that characterized other Reacher novels.  Hoping the next one deserves five stars - this one didn't.
B008FOB124|3.0|I am in duality with this album. I think nothing really progressed after all this time. It is a coming together of two disciplines: Brendan's and Lisa's. Brendan is my absolute favorite but his songs could also be released on his brilliant 'Ark' album or if he waited longer on a follow up. Lisa's middle eastern songs start to get on my nerves. It starts to sound always the same crooning and to be frank I would rather have her sing the 'medieval' song style like they did on 'Spleem and Ideal'.<br />Brendans' Children Of The Sun and Amnesia are my favorites. 9 songs is not much for a 15 year hiatus and the length of songs can't be an argument. To be truthful: I am a bit disappointed but I still carry a warm heart to this band. I wait rather for a new Brendan Perry album.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|So I thought the Son of Neptune was incredible, and after waiting months for The Mark of Athena, I must admit it was fabulous. Simply amazing, though I am sad that I must wait a year until the next book. Rick Riordan is a great author and he certainly knows how to appeal to the right audience, so to speak. Five stars, though the ending could be better; really a cliff-hanger. Another great book by Riordan, can't wait for the next!
B007VUA7VO|4.0|Battery HD is a handy way to keep track of one's power level, and shares some helpful information interpreting power levels into practical information for various activities, showing the times of battery life left (based on specific tasks). It's attractive, and does not appear to be a drag on the system. At the same time, it's really not a necessary app, so you can do without it quite nicely.
0307895475|5.0|It is exactly what my son wanted. He uses it all the time, and loves the information about the game.
B0064SHI9I|5.0|I love this app! After losing all my data last year when my SD card died, I purchased this and it's been a life saver! There's no need for a rooted phone! This worked perfect on my stock HTC Incredible and now on my stock Razr Maxx. Plus, the tech support is top notch! Thank you RerWare, you rock!
B0086700CM|3.0|good I guess....but when I am just about at 1.000.000 points it freezes up and I have to restart my whole kindle!
B009NQKPUW|3.0|Was looking forward to seeing this movie from watching the previews. It is visually striking and the special effects are amazing. It just seemed to me to rely on these things more than a great plot. I would recommend you see it but would rent it not wait for the DVD.
B0086700CM|5.0|I JUST WANTED THE FRICKEN STARS TO GET ALOT DAM HIGHER SOOOOO THAT IS WHY I AM DOING THIS!!!! VERY VERY VERY FUN GAME!!!
B00785P2QC|4.0|I like the graphics and how you make moneys when you are not there as well as a bunch of other stuff
B008BM9L72|2.0|I HAD to read this trilogy thanks to all the hype and I was determined to finish all 3 books but it was a real struggle. Christian Grey is a really unlikeable character. I don't really understand how anyone could find this man attractive. So I think that made reading these books very difficult for me - its hard to connect when you dislike a character so much! And I found the storyline a bit boring - even the sex scenes! And the nature of the sex scenes should have made it anything but boring!  But I just found it all very repetitive and was flipping through pages just to get to the next bit. I don't think it was worth all the hype.
B0053O89WY|5.0|I so enjoy the antics of the actors and actresses.  They can always seem to make me laugh.  Not just chuckle the big belly laughs.  Kudos to the writers.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|This series is an excellent tale of a post-apocalyptic world where humans must struggle to survive under very strained circumstances. The author has done an excellent job of bringing both the characters and the microcosm of humanity. I see that the book has been optioned for a movie and I certainly look forward to seeing it.
0316228532|5.0|Almost finished reading book.  So far I like it very much.  It is such a different storyline from the Harry Potter series.  Those books really taught kids and some adults, hopefully, some life lessons.  This one seems to be doing some of that too.<br />I am really happy for her success. What a great lady she is who gives so much back to children.
B00932IHGK|4.0|Emotionally, it's suspenseful and all too realistic;  I wonder how many of the young men who fight overseas are vulnerable to the teachings of radical anything?  Remembering the recordings of Tokyo Rose of WWII attempting to brainwash/seduce the boys to betray their homeland. Terrorism is so scary to contemplate and this series explores my worst fears.
B007ZBWJXI|5.0|Great musicians make great albums.  It won't be a chart topper and that's a shame but well worth the money.
B0076DCT2G|4.0|I received a couple of emails from Amazon recomending this book which sparked an interest. I downloaded the book for Kindle and have just finished it. It's a nice read.

B008Z9YGEE|4.0|Think this a duplicate request for review but liked it so much that I rated it again. All characters were well cast, particularly Katniss.<br />Gave it a 4 rather than 5 because I'd read the book and the condensed parts of the movie removed some the flavor and excitement found in the book detail.<br /><br />GJ
B008JAFXOQ|1.0|I saw this in a theater, so it's possible that the directors cut is worth a look, but I doubt it. I'm amazed by the positive reviews the film has received. This is easily one of the ten worst films I've ever seen. It had no flow, bogged down by scenes that go nowhere, behaviors that are never explained and the editing was so bad that in one scene, I thought the projector broke. Run, don't walk, away from this film.
B008GVD6D8|5.0|May cannot come soon enough what an utter pleasure to read!! Knocks spots off of 50 shades enjoyed every second of reading this after reading bared to you. I think you should bring the release date for the final of the trilogy forward! :)

8866130907|5.0|I've used this planner for years and love it! The cover is very durable and even though wear and tear shows by the end of the year, I've never had problems with pages falling out, etc. Its still lightweight and small enough to toss in my purse or backpack. I love the page format: weekly calendar on the left page and a lined page opposite. Its perfect for me, as a student, because I use the lined page to list my assignments and reading for the week. This will be my fourth year ordering this planner!
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I saw the movie first not knowing what it was going to really be about. The previews made it look happy and light but I was sure surprised and in a good way. And it just made me want to read the book immediately and I couldn't put it down. Such a great and honest look at life
0375507256|4.0|The failure of some reviewers to comprehend the depth and nuances of this book is, frankly, an indication of its brilliance. One reader threw in the towel after the first few pages, disgusted by the use of the ampersand in place of \\"and\\" - completely oblivious to the fact that, like the vocabulary shifts throughout, it was a historical writing device - and another huffed that the book seemed \\"disconnected\\" (well, it is in a way, but in a way it's completely connected, and that's the very point). This is no piece of fluff, so if you don't want to put your thinking cap on, steer clear.<br /><br />Others have recapped the genius of the plot and writing style, so I won't tread into that territory. I'll just say that, while this is the most astonishingly original read I've had in a long time, its creativity left me enriched but its message left me a bit hollow. For those who love fatalism and care not a fig for \\"happy endings,\\" this could be the book of the century.
B0052ZQMLO|4.0|[Updated on November 2014]    Translation dictionary support in the Kindle app for iPad works quite well now. Contextual Look-ups tend to handle declension variations correctly. That, and the prevalence of touch-based e-ink kindles, makes this dictionary much more useful than a few years ago, certainly for me.    Still, read carefully the product description. Some other kindle apps do not support translation dictionaries. Kudos to Collins for being clear about this, and shame on Amazon for not updating their Kindle apps / cloud readers.
B008RV5K4U|5.0|This movie followed the book so closely that I almost felt like I was reading it again. It is a great movie depicting Frank Miller's Dark Knight Returns Series.  I am very pleased with my purchase and I am awaiting the sequel's release. I also recommend reading the book to go along with this.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|with some games i find myself getting sucked in and spending too much time, but i like this one because when i run out of coins, i have to stop playing and wait for more to regenerate.  which is fine because then that is my automatic cue to put the game down and get back to reality!  but it's really fun when i do have coins.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|One of the best CD's I've heard in ages! Although you can find the tracks on youtube, I thought it was well worth supporting The Piano Guys by buying a CD so they could continuing making incredible music. I do not regret my purchase one bit! Every track is crafted to perfection! I love listening to this CD anytime I can, it enhances any situation I am in (be it working or working out!)<br /><br />Buy this CD, you wont regret it.
B009YDAUJ0|3.0|This is a Zombie TV series right? It's called the Walking Dead so I guess so.<br /><br />So when the series departs from a theme that has Zombies as the primary focus I get very uncomfortable.<br /><br />This episode has 'bout 30 seconds of Zombies as a \\"part\\" of the plot. Most of it is related to a really crazy guy who controls a town . . . a really sick SOB.<br /><br />A couple survivors who were separate from the main group are caught up with this settlement.<br /><br />I'm okay with this for right now but I have this creepy feeling that the rest of the season is going to get caught up in conflict between this small town and the group just like it did in the horrible second season on the farm.<br /><br />I'm not going to buy the season ticket as I'm waiting to see if this season tanks like last season did.
B009NPKTN6|1.0|Acting was insipid, stars mailed in their performance, the two young leads were equally awful (though the girl could sing).  Pass on it.
1601251505|5.0|I was pleasantly surprised that it arrived a day early. The book is everything I expected it to be. But since I was leaving for vacation, it was really to my advantage that it came a day early. Kudos to the shipping team.
B008LZHA3G|5.0|Dylan's tribute to John Lennon is very moving and genuine. To me it is the heart and soul of Tempest. No other assassination of a popular public figure was as disgusting and meaningless as Lennon's. What can we do with such a paparazzi-madness fueled culture as this? Our whole culture has become like the final apocalyptic scene in \\"Day of the Locusts\\". The song \\"Tempest\\" , like Nathaniel West's story, reflects the apocalyptic, panic, confusion and destruction that sometimes takes us out...but on a much larger scale.<br /><br />When John Lennon sang , he no longer believed in Zimmerman or the Beatles or others on his list (the song \\"God\\"), he was telling the world to look at them as human beings not fabricated nearly religious icons created by mass media. That dream was over. Dylan surely knew where he was coming from. Good music was still to be made, music that reflected a more truthful reality.<br /><br />There is great \\"Bob Dylan\\" music on this album. Every song has something to offer. The band does not really rock but kinda lopes along like a western soundtrack. Solid and supportive with very little showing off or solo work. Just good music for Bob's damaged  but still effective voice. This is my favorite Dylan album of the last 15 years and I am not a casual listener, I have of all his work. I'm no expert I just know what I like.<br />.<br /> Tempest is successful because he has looked at the world and reflected an honest truthful picture of man in this universe. The ultimate irony of life is on display here and presented in such a way that most people that like Bob's work are responding to it in a positive way. What is that irony?....... the fact that everyone one of us with all of our personalities, feelings, emotions and identities are doomed..we all are here for a short time and then we are gone. We know not where. The life force that created us and holds us will eventually destroy us. There is no understanding of this no matter what we say.<br /><br /> Zimmerman has sensed this from the very beginning of his career but he's always been a spiritual person and that gives him peace. It helps a lot of people but as he has said, it's difficult to write a religious or spiritual work...that's why we have Tempest. As dark as Tempest is, I find it very spiritual in a facing the truth manner.<br /><br />As we get older we lose a step or two..... but Bob Dylan/Zimmerman ain't going \\"gentle into that good night\\".erman has sensed this from the very beginning of his career but he's always been a spiritual person and that gives him peace.

B005VQE2LQ|3.0|I admit the Green Lantern movie was not great but it certainly didn't suck as much as Batman & Robin. Personally I was just stoked that the Green Lantern character would ever get a big budget movie so that for me was enough to watch it. I understand not every person is familiar with the character or grew up reading the comics so its hard to like the movie unless you are already somewhat of a fan.<br />  Most people will agree that they did get some things right on for example, Mark Strong as Sinestro (Hell Yeah!) and yes Ryan Reynolds was a capitol choice for Hal Jordan. Other than those two pluses, I do think the movie crossed too many story lines for a first movie. Only dedicated fan boys can keep up with all of the mishmash that was going on.<br /> They crossed at least 3 major story lines all in the first film and that to me was complete overkill. The Sinestro Corp War storyline was hinted at, The Parallax storyline was raped and abused into this film and the Hal Jordan origin story was rushed along in this film as well.<br />  I totally think that Hugo Strange did not even need to be in this film. The Movie should've just focused on Hal Jordan, his origins and early days as the Green Lantern of Earth. The other story lines could be spread across a really nice trilogy that could've ended with the Parallax Saga. Overall I still could watch this again and I give the creators of this film at least 3 stars for the effort.<br /><br />P.S. The Limited Edition Steel book of this movie is not worth it! Don't spend any extra cash just to have this thin, tinfoil case. You can get the 3D 4-disc version now much cheaper than the Steel book version. They need to stop calling them Steel books because now all they give us is tinfoil.
B004J4WN0I|5.0|What a great ride! I loved the world building and attention to detail. Loved the strong voice. I'm really looking forward to more in this series.
B001EW5FIK|5.0|[[VIDEOID:mo1P49NULXNW38C]]Love this deck! I'd recommend it for beginners and up. It is my new standard. It's a little on the darker side with the images. They are supposed to tap into the subconscious and bring out all the hidden ideas, thoughts and feelings. From my experience it really does that. I wasn't sure if I'd like it at first, but the images really pop,are clear, have wonderful color and are easy to interpret from the cards.<br /><br />There is only the little white book that comes with it, but the author does a great job of describing the arcanas, suites and each card individually as well as giving upright and reverse meanings. It sticks close to rider-waite, but has it's own unique place. They even come with a map for a special spread called the Lunatic spread in the shape of a moon which is now my only spread I use (instead of the Celtic cross). Must have deck for all tarot readers and collectors! None other out there quite like it.
B003VSVWA0|5.0|He really got a lot better when he got in his 70,s it seems like he really found himself I would recamend his latest work the most.
B0042C1BP0|5.0|Bond, as portrayed by Daniel Craig is gritty and dark. This character really builds the character that we know as the slick, debonair Bond..
B007J4T2G8|5.0|There is more to this book than just sex, it has really great storyline as well. There was more depth to this book than I had expected and I highly recommend it!
B003DZX44I|3.0|The opening monologue has changed. The new voice is not as dramatic as the old voice, and sounds a little pretentious, so it's a bit of a letdown. The wording has also changed slightly. So be aware that, despite how this is being advertised, the original theatrical release version of the movie is not 100% faithful to the original.<br /><br />Also, the DVD has some glitches, right out of the packaging. I don't have a Blu-Ray player yet so I can't test the Blu-Ray disc.
B001H1SVO8|5.0|If you haven't seen fight club, you must. The Amazon rental was very easy to use and of good quality.
B005D9MUWY|4.0|Since the fix was entered, this product works as advertised.<br /><br />Only keyboard that I use on any phone I ever buy.<br /><br />Please add EMOJI support and I will up to five stars.
B008UUPOVM|4.0|Let me start by saying I'm a relatively new Owl City fan.  I casually listened a few years ago, then slowly but surely, have been purchasing almost anything Adam Young does.  His music could not be any more different than what I typically listen to (Rush, Coheed & Cambria, Dream Theater [Mike Portnoy era], Transatlantic, etc.)<br /><br />Albums like Of June, An Airplane Carried Me To Bed, and All Things Bright and Beautiful grabbed me during the first pass.. not so with The Midsummer Station.  I had purchased the 'Shooting Star' EP a few months prior to this album arriving, so I had an idea of what to expect.  My hope, though, was that there would be some stonger tracks on the full-length album, and Adam delivered.<br /><br />Tracks like 'Embers' and 'Dreams and Disasters' are classic Owl City.  If you like 'Hello Seattle', 'Fireflies', or 'The Airway', then those will speak to you.  By this point, you probably have heard 'Good Time' on the radio -- this ultimately may be the song that moves Owl City even more mainstream.<br /><br />The mix on this album is much different than, say, All Things Bright and Beautiful.  On many tracks, it sounds like the instruments are further back in the mix than they should be.  Honestly, I almost thought there was something wrong with my headphones until I listened to it in the car.<br /><br />In closing..this is an overall winner -- there's something on here for every Owl City fan.  I like this album a considerable amount more than when I first purchased it.  Just don't expect something with the strength of All Things Bright and Beautiful.
0385344333|5.0|My wife is the devoted Reacher fan in our family. She has read every book in the series. She loved \\"Wanted Man\\",saying it is one of Child's best. She finshed it in a day. Also, many thanks to Amazon for for the quick replacement. The first copy arrived in the mail slightly damaged. They got a new one to us the day after I reported it.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I didn't think it was possible to top \\"Bared to You\\" but Sylvia Day did just that. An incredible story of how deeply you can love someone!!
145210655X|5.0|My 6 year old son never expressed a whole lot of interest in Star Wars, but I was a big fan when I was a kid. We got this book and he immediately fell in love with it. The jokes are definitely for Star Wars fans and we had a great time going through all the movies and watching the related parts. He's been a Star Wars fan ever since. We still read this together all the time and and laugh and laugh and laugh.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|I like games that are challenging but not impossible.  Stimulant for the brain, but not headache-inducing. Games that you can play when that's all you have to do, or that you can play while on the phone or watching the ball game. Call of Atlantis is all of these. I just finished my second time through and I'm still enjoying it!

B009UQCD0K|5.0|This show is just outstanding.  In some ways it's better than last year because that kind of dragged on being on the farm.  I still wonder why some choices are made in the zombie apocalypse environment, but hey, it's just a show.  He kinda let's his kid run around on his own.  Even as an adult I'd use the buddy system.  Much anticipated and worth it.  Still awesome!
B006OAB2XO|5.0|First things first: if you love 80's pop, Enya, or even melodic Asian music, you should give this album a listen. Claire Boucher seamlessly blends several musical aesthetics into a cohesive whole that swirls and thumps and dances about with unabashed fun. Her voice is at once soothing and titillating - flitting through the ether like a frolicking fairy. I happily stumbled upon this album while searching for other bands on Amazon. After listening to the samples I decided to take the plunge and purchase it, but I can say without a doubt that the 30-second samples don't do the songs justice. Many of the songs have changeups in tone, beat, and even melody that make them different from today's typical Euro techno, hip-hop, or even New Wave. (Though, those songs have their time and place as well.)<br /><br />If my review intrigues you, then make the small purchase and support a young artist. I only hope she continues to produce this fresh style of music without being corrupted by the bigger music industry.<br /><br />Fav songs: \\"Genesis\\", \\"Oblivion\\", \\"Be a Body\\", \\"Symphonia IX\\"
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I cant stop playing this game. Help! Love time trial mode for easy puzzles and free play for the more difficult ones.
B001AQT11M|5.0|The work that went into re-mastering this classic is very evident.  I had an older dvd of this movie and compared the two.  The difference is stark.  It no longer looks like a 1937 cartoon.  The extra material and storyboards are fun.
B002O3Z50G|5.0|This is a movie that still has excellent special effects, a well developed storyline and some of the most memorable scenes of all time. I found myself quoting it all over again when I re-watched it and it still was able to capture my attention even after seeing it so many times. I highly recommend this film if you've never seen it!
B004P95A8E|5.0|I comes with three action figures so it is a complete set for the star wars fan.  My grandson likes everything star wars and everything LEGO so this fits the bill.  Not sure sometimes if I am buying these for my grandson or my son.  My son still has his old LEGOs and some of them are still put together just like he did them yesterday...when in fact they are 20 to 25 years old.  All of my favorite toys were metal cars and trucks and they are long since rusted away.
B000JQUKKU|4.0|Always love the classic. I could almost see the classic movie in my mind while I read the story. Good job
B000MR9D5E|5.0|Love having this on dvd.  I copied them all to my home network so they can stream to any device on the home network.  This is a great series.  Seems that BBC is the place to go for great video.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|This book does not disappoint! You find yourself sharing the emotions each character experiences right along with them. It grabs you from the first page and doesn't let go. I will be pre-ordering for the third book and can't wait until May 2013!
B0013ND30M|5.0|The quality of this re-do is fantastic.  The picture pops as you watch this old classic on your HD set.  The extra content is fun and interesting.  Well worth the money.  Great to introduce a classic to my grandsons.
B004UJCYYW|4.0|I dont know why this edition has no preface. I expected it would have Victor Hugos preface. In the other hand I really like it because it is free charge! Thank you very much!
B00466HN6S|4.0|Hop is a delightful movie to watch. It is light hearted and very funny. It's about the Easter Bunny's son EB who runs away from taking the reigns from his legendary father. EB is chasing his dreams to be a famous drummer and running away from his father's royal guard.<br /><br />While the story isn't all out amazing, it is something you can put on and just watch on a dreary day. It is not meant to cause great emotion. It is a solid family film, and I'm glad I watched it. It is very colorful as a cartoon type film should be, and you can expect the happy ending, which is always important in films like these.<br /><br />I say give it a try. It's not bad at all.
B0084IG7KC|4.0|Excelente disco, la película muy buena, llego antes de lo esperado directo a la dirección de mi trabajo en Perú. Lo único malo es que los extras están sin subtitulo, por los demás muy bueno.
B005LAIGLE|5.0|Contraband is truly a different kind of action flick. It starts off with two young men bringing in drugs. They have to dump the shipment because the border patrol invades the ship. They have to answer to goons, who in turn tries to kill them soon after. One of the boys dies, but one lives. Mark Wahlberg's character, Chris, is pulled in to help his young brother in law pay off the debt he owes to the drug dealers. Of course, the movie starts moving at a faster pace, eventually moving to Panama, where there is off the seat action. The Panama portion is the meat of the film, and it was fun to watch.<br /><br />I loved this movie. I have never seen anything like it. It is the kind of the movie that you can't walk away from because there is a lot going on, and it's all connected in one way or another. It is a well crafted storyline and all of the actors did a great job.<br /><br />I know there is a lot of reviewers that don't like it. It's not a complete shoot 'em up, car chase at every scene, bombings at every turn kind of movie. It is what I call a smart action film. Things happen you don't expect, and I really liked the refreshing change to the action genre.<br /><br />I recommend watching it.
B000002LJA|5.0|The more I listen to this recording the better it gets. I didn't realize at first just how star-studded this recording is. It's packed with big-name artists. I don't think there is anything in its category quite like it. I feel it was too sophisticated for average hip-hop fans and not sophisticated enough for non-hip-hop fans, but I now feel it was most certainly wayyyyyy ahead of its time. If it already hasn't, it should win some kind of major musical award!<br /><br />I'd have to say that the time for this recording to be fully appreciated has finally come; at least for those of exceptional musical tastes. I believe that is George Benson at his best doing a lead solo at the end of Birdland. Amazing!
B004WGIXX4|2.0|...but that's how long I hung in there waiting for the movie to 'develop' before I opted out. But then again, I guess that is the review.
B002MQYOFW|3.0|There is a specific flavor to this book and I feel it lies somewhere between twilight and Harry potter and closer to the potter end.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|I love this app... it is so amazing it has woken me up everyday for the last 6monthes failing only once.... and that is helpful because I'm a heavy sleeper.....
B008XX6J4C|4.0|I enjoy their short you tube videos! While the album is good I really like watching the location shots, themes, with the videography of the music components. While the music is good they have spoiled me for the video portion which is outstanding.
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|This app is great! it has more plot, better plans, and is just awesome. reviews take a while though. I love it
B004SBQGHS|5.0|I downloaded this to my Kindle HD Fire 7\\" and could not stop playing it.  I have just completed every level and will reeturn to try to do better after I finish the other Angry Bird gamees I downloaded.  It will probably be baned in the near future by our goverment.

B003O86FMW|1.0|It sucked so bad its not even funny. My kids even hated it,that is bad it sucked  I hate this series. <br />     <br /><br />                                                        :(<br />:(<br />                 :(<br />                               :(
074325144X|5.0|This book and running technique was recommended to me by someone during a casual conversation after I explained how I found running outdoors so much harder than running on a treadmill.  He correctly diagnosed my problem as \\"power running\\"  and told me about Chi running, and described one of the principles.<br /><br />So I checked out some Youtube videos and bought this book, used, $.99 plus $3.99 shipping.<br /><br />It works!  I thought I knew how to run, but I was doing several things wrong.  Using these principles or techniques of motion: body position, lean, striding behind you/not in front of you, landing on middle of foot, having your foot strike directly below your center of gravity instead of reaching your leg forward, faster cadence, really made a difference.<br /><br />I can go faster and farther now.  My joints take less of a pounding (big factor since I'm middle aged) so I now have no joint pain towrds the end of a long run.  Using Chi Running, I did my first half marathon without getting wiped out!  My two previous half-marathons were killers.<br /><br />I no longer pronate/heel-strike.<br /><br />I actually bought an electronic metronome, like the author recommends, and use it with ear-buds to control my cadence, and it works too.  The faster cadence, along with a shorter stride is mechanically more efficient, less tiring, and allows me to go longer before muscle fatigue sets in.<br /><br />By changing my foot-strike, I am working different foot muscles, so I have been using a small rubber ball, in between a golf ball and tennis ball in size, to massage the soles of my feet by rolling it between my foot and the floor.<br /><br />I'm so grateful to the author I think I'll either buy a new book or just send him a gift since authors don't make money off the sales of  used books.
B0049P1VHS|5.0|This show is never going to get the critical love that The Sopranos or The Wire gets, because it does have a tendency to fall back on gore and silly zombie killing.<br /><br />Once you get past the blood and goofiness that always accompanies Zombie movies, this show is a smart take on human interaction. While watching the first two seasons, I was repeatedly surprised by the level of acting. There are some plot holes, but overall this show has strong characters and strong writing. Even if you're not a fan of the silly stuff, this show is worth watching.
B007EECSFA|5.0|Books like \\"The Secret Keeper\\" are the reason why I love to read. It was amazing. Reading doesn't get much better than this.<br /><br />Thanks Ms. Morton for giving me this story and escape from reality.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|its super addictive watch out u might get sucked in for a couple of hours, I love this game, peece
B0083SBMBM|5.0|love all the action,the fighting were Thor and Iron Man was,and when Captain American came in the screen. Now when all was in the city fighting the Hulk was the bigges of the action.
B008LSVL6U|5.0|My son and I attended the concert at the Berklee Performance Center during this tour, and watching this Blu Ray edition was even better than being there live! The filming and editing are just about perfect, and the sound is pristine. I have a 5.1 audio setup... and I was astonished at the mix and clarity... this is the best live 5.1 mix I've heard yet. The musicianship exhibited during this concert is unbelievable -- craftsmanship of the highest caliber. I felt like I was watching a historic document.<br /><br />It would have been nice if the Blu Ray included more of the stage film that was projected during some of the songs during the concert. For example, the stage film that accompanied \\"Raider II\\" was the most chilling and creepy visual sequence I've ever seen and it pushed the climax of the tune over the top.<br /><br />Overall... amazing artistry... amazing sound... amazing film quality... and near-perfect editing. Nice job, Mr. Wilson!
B006LSZECO|1.0|It was to slow moveing. It just took to long to say what it was going to do. It didn't hold my interest at all. The only reason I kept reading it was I had to read something.  CINDY
B009439HEY|5.0|Several of the other 5-star reviews have already captured my sentiments about this magnificent double CD. Fantastic recording quality, yet with a classic sound! True enough to the originals to evoke the same feelings and sensations but with plenty of subtle arrangement touches and creative instrumentation flourishes to keep it fresh. Well done, Mr. Hackett and company! There is not a weak track to be found on this collection. My favorites are \\"Can-Utility and the Coastliners\\" and the new version of \\"Supper's Ready\\"... but then again, it's all good. Enjoy!
B003TSEL7S|5.0|Love the Percy Jackson books & The Lost Hero didn't disappoint!!!  It was a little bummed that Percy isn't actually in the story but, it makes me excited to read the next one
B000JML90Y|5.0|It's the third time I have read this book. It's one book everyone should read even if you disbelieve in what was writen.
B007FEFLTO|3.0|Very disappointed.  After waitiung so long, I think Follett could have done beter with the historical aspects of the era rather that the romances and sex lives of the characters.  Hope the conclusion is better.
B008O9V4C2|5.0|My, my... This one is as juicy, smooth and tight as a [you fill this in]...and it adoringly makes love to my sound stage (Manley Labs/Bowers & Wilkins). It sounds like it was recorded inside a pillow...very comforting and satisfying. With every pass one discovers something new. Really whacked the way the melody lines work with the chord structures...they shouldn't, but they do. This is one sweet, slick, sick album. Must have. Mr. Fagen, deny us not the 5.1?
1451695195|1.0|This book disappointed me. I was expecting much more material on his actual NDE, but only about 5% of the book deals directly with his NDE and I am being generous. I am happy for him that he survived and had all of his cognitive abilities return, but I really was not interested in hearing so many details of his medical and personal trials or his recovery. I wanted to hear more about his NDE. He claimed to have communicated with God. What did God say? What did he learn from God? The title of this book is \\"Proof of Heaven\\"; but, frankly, this author didn't prove anything to me and I am a believer, so I am certain he will not be able to prove anything to his skeptical godless medical colleagues. The author described his NDE as a dark bottomless core and a murky earthworm's view of an underworld. God is a being of light, which leaves me doubting the divinity of his experience. Quite frankly this author's description of heaven is a place I would not like to visit.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|I stayed up way too late several nights reading this book, because it was just too hard to put down.  Just one more chapter, always led to three more chapters.  One suggestion as you begin to read, unless your memory is much better than mine, jot down the names of the characters and how they are related to others.  There are babies born to slave women who are fathered by white men, and sometimes other women end up mothering someone else's baby for a variety of reasons.  It can get confusing.  Incredible story!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|this game is awesome! yes its like temple run but I like the fact that you can change characters and use the coins to buy more coins or other stuff. grab the app while its free pretty cool.
B004XDYJRU|4.0|I like this app enough to buy and support the developer. Now for my request for a future enhancement... Figure out a way to randomly shuffle favorite radio stations when starting the application.  I use this as my alarm clock and it would be good to wake up to a different fav station instead of setting up the night before.
1451673442|5.0|We believe what we believe because we are taught from a young age.  As one raised with the theory of evolution as fact, both at home and in school, it became confusing.  How can we be an accident? Descended from apes, but apes still exist?  Why would only homo sapiens be able to talk, walk and have higher thought?  Wouldn't every species have evolved to such a level?  IF it's proven fact, why would it still be called a 'theory'?  Magic Man in the Sky gives the answers scientifically-speaking.  We must have faith in something - whether it be science or a Creator - and this book gives more information upon which to base your trust.  In-depth yet understandable.  I liked it, very much!
0525953728|4.0|No Easy Day is the autobiography of one of Navy Seals who was part of the team that got Osama Bin Laden.  Few would object to how the narrative is written.  The narrative is clear with each topic moving easily into the next.  Several maps and pictures are included to further aid the reader's understanding.<br /><br />The substance of the narrative, however, is controversial.  The author claims that \\"no secrets\\" are revealed.  However, the author described how the Seals use infrared chips to show each other that an area is safe.  This tactic was unknown to this reader and was probably unknown to most of the Taliban or members of Al-Qaeda.  Now, with knowledge of this tactic, the terrorists and insurgents have yet another way of laying a trap to kill Americans.<br /><br />Over the course the author's service, the rules changed for conducting raids.  In early raids, the Seals just shot the bad guys -- even if children were present.  The author doesn't seem to understand that such unrestrained killing plays into the terrorist hands (in that the children will grow up and want to seek revenge for their father's death).  Later in the narrative, bad guys are not shot, but detained.  However, these detentions were usually short-lived, and the bad guys are free to make trouble again.  There just has to be a middle ground.<br /><br />With respect to the raid for Bin Laden, which takes up roughly one third of the book, one gets the impression that the women and children at Bin Laden's compound were, in a sense, liberated by the Seals.  Because their patron (Bin Laden) was dead they are now free to lead relatively normal lives.<br /><br />With one exception, No Easy Day does not get into politics or the merit of one counter-terrorism policy over another.  That exception is the author's unexplained derision for President Obama.  His dislike for Obama is obvious, yet nowhere in the text does the author explain why he has such a low opinion of Obama.<br /><br />Still, that bias aside, No Way Out is worth reading.  It is much more than an after action on the raid to get Bin Laden.  It is an insightful account on what it takes to become, and the sacrifices made to remain, a Navy Seal.de, No Way Out is worth reading.  It is much more than an after action on the raid to get Bin Laden.  It is an insightful account on what it takes to become, and the sacrifices made to remain, a Navy Seal.
B007TK77QE|5.0|I didn't read all the Harry Potter books because the magic was just a little bit too much for me but I loved this well-written, down-to earth chronic of a small town in England with all the characters who live there.<br />Rowling sees into the very soul of the persons and is able to convey to us her vision in a way that it is difficult to put down the book although doesn't happen very much in it.
0802136834|5.0|This book is very well written and reads more like a novel than a history book. This made it very easy to read. I thoroughly enjoyed my time spent reading about Henry's wives while getting a good history of what life was like in 16th century England.

B00094OBS4|2.0|Saw this concert on Netflix streaming and just had to own it, but when it arrived we discovered it would not play on the high-def DVD in the family room. Got the error message \\"Cannot play this disc. Video format of the disc does not meet required video output format of this product. Discs purchased from abroad may not be playable.\\" The disk did play in an older DVD in the office, but that is an inconvenient place to watch. Disappointing.
B003O86FMW|4.0|great book. i liked it better than the first but that could be because i watched the movie and it made the second where i didn't know what was going to happen.
0399229191|5.0|Nice bedtime book.  I bought the small one and it is easier to hold and handle by my 2 1/2 y/o granddaughter.  She loves the ending when the book makes the cricket sound.  Definitely worth the money.
1439152799|5.0|This book was received very timely and was in the condition expected.  Although I am a fan of Kate Morton I did not enjoy this book as much and did not finish so I will pass it along for other's enjoyment.
B007ZD17XO|5.0|If you want a fast match 3 game with increasing difficulty and brain teasing challenges,  this is it!  A big part of the fun is choosing the right totems with your gold stars.  At least you can go back later and change your mind and return a star so you can place it somewhere else.
B007IXWL2C|3.0|The first book was good it did hold my attention.The second book was very difficult to get through,it was way stretched out. The third book was the best of all, remember people still like a good story!!!
0425263908|5.0|I am not a frequent reader, but I absolutely loved it.  Just purchased the 2nd of the series.  Can't wait until the 3rd book of the series is released.  I can't put them down.  As good as or better than 50 Shades.
0061537969|1.0|Far-fetched, modern fantasy novel.  Not my favorite type of book, but this was just too over the top to even consider a \\"good\\" book.  It felt like 3 different themes: a lifetime movie, car racing, and a dog, with brute-force writing to tie them together.  It didn't really make sense how these things could all be related, and the story line of the trial just comes out of nowhere - like a bad lifetime movie.<br /><br />Interesting idea, but felt like poor execution - as if it was written in a college English class.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I love this game it's really addictive. I spend more time playing this game than I do watching Tv. I just wish it did'nt take so long for to get the coins. it does pass the time though.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|the plot develops as we read along- not predictable!<br />amazing characters and it makes you anxious to know what will happen in the 3rd book even though the story has a satisfying ending in the 2nd book.<br />Great scene with the ex!
0792164903|5.0|With his signature quirky wit and charm, Johnny Depp shines as the title character, Ichabod Crane, in Sleepy Hollow. A dark re-telling of Washington Irving's masterpiece in true Tim Burton style. It is beautifully filmed and a pleasure to watch. Excellent Halloween night movie!
B006LS7DQE|1.0|loved puzzle quest on dbl. was very pumped to see this on kindle but it wont even install waste of 4 dollars.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Like Temple Run, but getting bored? Pick up this game! It's the same concept, but it's very different, and better than TR. Grab it while its free!

B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Highly addicting and a great time killer!  I've been playing this game for three weeks and can't put it down.
B0055PGUYU|4.0|The book provides a good base about the theory of how habits work, as well as very good examples. I wish it could just go a little deeper in the theory.
B005K0HDGE|4.0|Truly enjoyed this book.  Great character development and sub plots.  At first it seemed King rushed to get into the story but then it became apparent why he needed to do that.  I'm sure like me a lot of baby boomers have asked the question \\"What would have happened if Kennedy lived?\\"<br />This was a truly entertaining depiction of the \\"What if\\".  Loved the historical references.  Will be recommending to all of my friends and family.
0425263908|5.0|Great read if you liked 50 Shades! Romantic, sexy and fun. Gideon will be your next Christian Grey. Would recommend to anyone.
B007GCY8FS|5.0|I have read all of the Jack Reacher novels.  This was the last one and I hope there will continue to be more.  This one was great, as usual, but I wouldn't say it was one of the best in the series.  As long as they keep coming, I'll keep reading them!
B0087HT36U|5.0|absolutely love this. Really makes your mind work. I am on pins and needles waiting for the update! I've gone back 4 times to try and get the best scores .  hurry up with the update sweet developers

B001GCUNYO|5.0|I love Liam he such a BadAss!! This movie was incredible plus the extras made the movie even better. The blu-ray is beautiful and the sounds are amazing
B0071XO8RA|5.0|What a great story of courage in a strange world.  I would love to learn more of how the silo came to be, and how these survivors re-make their future.  I had not heard of this series until it was a Kindle daily deal.  Fans of post-apocalyptic science fiction will enjoy the series.
0316228532|1.0|I tried and kept trying and I'm pretty sure it would have eventually turned into something but I just couldn't get into it. Sorry but it wasn't for me, and for the record, I was a HP FAN.
B0096PAA6E|3.0|Tracks 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 13<br /><br />These songs remind me of a mature, more Hendrixy, grungy version of Gary that I used to see for free in austin 1999-2004, when he had a small, local fan base and played for little $$$.<br /><br />However, this is the worst version of Things Are Changing (Track 10). I'd rather here his guitar more front-in-center. Some of the tracks are just overproduced. With the talent level of Gary, you don't have to GLOSS over his voice with effects.<br /><br />However, for the most part these songs are ballsy awesome and soulful. He's more psychedelic than he used to be. He's equally good as a singer and guitarist. Travis County and Please Come Home could have been replaced with more straight ahead blues...like he did on Tribute<br /><br />3, 6, 12<br /><br />These songs sounds like suggestions from a record company and/or an attempt to identify with the MTV generation. Completely generic and embarrassing for an artist of his caliber.<br /><br />I like him as an R&B funk singer and he's obviously a great blues, rock guitarist, but attempts to be POP, modern R&B or rap are awful.<br /><br />Stick to what you know in the future. Remember the reason you became popular was because you played and sang blues and molded into R&B, funk, soul, psychedelia.<br /><br />None of your real fans care if you collaborate with pop starts like Alicia Keys. It will just dilute your music BUT increase your sales. Overproduction and drum machines make you sound like a caricature of yourself.
B009JBZH54|1.0|Well it may seem trivial to some people, but to the collector and fan when a box set of any kind (especially a trilogy) is released we expect nice packaging with cool (or at least tasteful) cover art. This looks like a cover to an early DVD from 1997, worthy of the original Burton/Schumacher Batman Anthology (in fact that box set has much better cover art). From other reviews I've read, there are no deleted scenes and little to no bonus material which is not only a drag, but frankly a bit insulting, it sorta gives the impression of \\"we know you'll buy it so just pay us already, we don't feel like spending time on this.\\" Which is pretty much true because in 2013 Warner Bros. is re-releasing this in an Ultimate Trilogy set, so this one is really just a petty, half-assed, interim cash-in. It consists basically of the three films, the first two which we all probably already own, and the last one being undoubtedly the weakest of the three. As a fan and collector who didn't particularly care for TDKR (I don't think I'm alone here) I would have most likely bought this to have the complete trilogy as most of us probably would. I maybe would have settled for basically no bonus material, but the cover art almost seems like it's mocking us. Seriously, it's that bad to me as a fan that I almost feel slapped in the face. It's almost laughing at us for handing our money over, and just like the edited Star Wars blu ray releases, I refuse to partake. We as the fans made this franchise a success, and they won't throw us a fraction of our due - why even bother?
B000W796OM|2.0|I have read Harry Potter from the beginning. And never watched a movie because I heard mixed reviews. I preferred my own vision. J.K. Rowling is just amazing and an old school, skilled, story teller. Now that my kids are getting older we have begun to listen to the book on tapes. Something my kids enjoy very much and because it is such a great book, I admit to being captured once again, even though I am not the one reading it. So we bought the first DVD's.<br />1 and 2 are good. They left a lot out. But it still expressed the authors thoughts and voice enough that you got the picture and wanted more.<br />So we just finished watching number 3.<br />What the  heck was that?<br />I get it, new Dumbeldore,and new director. You can't put the entire book into the movie etc.<br />But everything is changed in this one. The fun the good scenes, like the gatherings at the great hall. And the Halloween scene with Sir Nick. This was all about the outdoors and the view of the director who , in my point of view, completely missed the point of this movie. Everything was cut, shortened or just didn't make it into this book. Moments that will continue on in the next book. And Ginny has hardly any part. But how does that then explain the happenings later on. Ron's new owl and so on. This is a rushed version of a story that was written very well but has been butchered for the movie. We were frustrated beyond. I hated the color. Green and gray or whatever. Who cares. This director changed it all and it made no sense. The professors have hardly an important role anymore. You see one or two times Professor Mc Gonegol. You never hear or see from Sir Geduggin and that the Fat Lady returns. Honestly, it doesn't allow you to bond with anyone. And the new Dumbeldor needs to slow down. He has little charm and is not as wise and smart. Or at least doesn't appear to be. 1 and 2.. yes there were cuts.. but that director understood what we enjoyed and loved about the book. Give me a break about Harry getting older. He is only 13. Haggrits hut was changed. What he just added on? And what happened to the forbidden forest? The magical creatures. Looks like backyard woods to me. The castle changed. Seriously. Where is the color and magical fun? The Weasley's house and the time spent there. And you need those moments for the next books/audio/ DVD, so you can understand. Ugh!. Frustrating. Thankfully we can listen to the tapes and get the correct version. It wasn't even explained why the willow tree was planted , for Lupin. Nothing was kept that was important. And seriously. This is not a regular school They should be wearing their ropes. What is with this wardrobe? They messed up so much and left out. Shame on the director for not thinking what the book is telling and expressing and people want to see, but for just looking at his point of view. I doubt he read the book or understood it. I mean, what the heck. He has a choir singing of goblins and witches at the beginning. That is not in the book at all. But that Harry was excited to be part of the sorting head moment.. because they had missed the others. That is not in there. And that Colin's brother was joining them. I mean. Those are important key information for what is to come. Very frustrating. no ceremony in the end that closes it up and points awarding or anything. This is a terrible mistake. Not worth the money. You can't just jump and change it all. The audience did not ask for it and enjoyed very much the version that stuck closest to the books. Shame on this director for stealing this away from us. These DVD's could have been a great hit. To think we had to wait 4 years for the next book because Warner Brothers wasn't finished making the movie. Yeah right. Shame. Blah. Not worth my time anymore.<br />I guess it is for each to decide if they like it or not. Which version they prefer. But this one is not just different and changes it all... it is also weird. Leaves you hanging. And why are there ghost horses and riders constantly jumping through windows etc. That is never in the book mentioned. And that is another point. Where is Sir NIck's amazing Halloween Party? Why is he not part of the movie? They do have a good relationship. Dumbeldore never stands at a podium. He doesn't have to. He is a persona that everyone recognizes. He does not need to be singled out. Oh I am steaming over this crab. Too bad. NO wonder many are frustrated. I am. This is the shade of green and gray I have to watch now for the next few DVD's. Yuck.<br />Very disappointing. I gave it a 2 star because it is Harry and some scenes are nicely done.<br />But nothing specially mentioned about Hagrit keeping his position at Hagwarts. Yuck1
B00571F26Y|4.0|Very thought provoking. Incredibly informative book and a really easy read. Time to review the diet in the name of better health. The whole time you are reading this book you are thinking of friends and family who have health issues and wondering if they are perhaps gluten related. A must read.
B002N5N4M6|5.0|Lets be honest, we've all seen it.  Its funny.  It lets us revel in geekdom.  And the price from Amazon was half the target price.  What more do you want to know?
1401324649|5.0|I read this book in the original Swedish about a year ago, and have been waiting for it to appear in English. This is not a novel where you look for deep insight or complicated structures. It's meant to be (and is) slightly absurd, completely unlikely, and just a good time. The translation, as far as I can tell, seems quite faithful.
B009KHBDUU|5.0|riveting! you can't quit watching it. Johnny Depp is excellent! Michelle Pfieffer is a diva! I was pleasantly surprised with this movie because I don't generally care for the supernatural.
B007CMD5AQ|5.0|I've been enjoying this recording so much, I feel obligated to add my 2 cents to these reviews. Forget for a moment, their Grammy Award winning track \\"Love Bites\\" (consider it a freebie); the song \\"Mz Hyde\\" is worth the price of admission alone! If their first self-titled recording wasn't enough, The Strange Case Of ... once again proves Halestorm has all the necessary ingredients to be at the top (or certainly near the top) of the rock heap. They have the vocal prowless, the instrumental intuition and skills and their song writing ain't bad either. In fact, most of the songs are quite clever lyrically. No arguing that lead singer Lzzy Hale has the vocal power to carry off the hard rocking numbers (and even I whose ears have been subjected to decibel abuse over the years understand every line she sings in them) but listen to the ballads found here; they really showcase her voice and prove what great singer she really is. Of course her phrasing is great and she can capture every nuance with perfection. Quite frankly, she compares favorably to any of the rock's greats past or present and many other artists in the rock world are beginning to take notice. In the coming years, we will more than likely find all sorts of collaborations with other artists; she's that good! The backing instrumentation is equally professional. The drumming by Arejay Hale (Lzzy's brother) is ridiculous. Talk about a talented family! Not more could be asked of guitarist Joe Hottinger or bassist Josh Smith. They, along with Lizzy on guitar herself all meld together to form quite a formidable sonic assault. Like all great rock it sounds immediate but of course a great deal of thought and craftsmanship has gone in to each and every song, which makes me wonder how great they would sound if they extended some of these numbers in concert jam band style (`course that goes to my old school background).  I'd also like to mention that the deluxe edition of this title contains 3 extra songs whose titles are \\"Don't Know How To Stop\\", \\"Private Parts\\" and \\"Hate It When You See Me Cry\\". This is the edition you will want to purchase. \\"Private Parts\\" features a duet with James Michael of Sixx:A.M. This track alone is worth any extra you pay for the deluxe edition. A couple reviewers have said they didn't like the song \\"In Your Room\\". Well I do.  It is sort of an update/answer to Brian Wilson's classic \\"In My Room\\". It is a heart-felt melodic ballad which shows the softer side of Lzzy Hale (in stark contrast to \\"Mz Hyde\\"). Do yourself a favor, buy this CD immediately. If you don't have their first self-titled release, download the Expanded version available here on Amazon of that title. It too contains 3 extra tracks and \\"Tell Me Where It Hurts\\" alone is worth any extra you will pay for the Expanded version. While you're at it also buy the ReAniMate: The CoVeRs EP. You'll love their take on Lady Gaga's \\"Bad Romance\\", thrilled with the homage to Heart on \\"All I Wanna Do Is Make Love To You\\" and impressed by their Beatles vision on \\"I Want You (She's So Heavy)\\" among others. If you are like me, you will find yourself playing these titles again and again. Money well spent! Keep it up Halestorm! Keep 'em coming! You've got what it takes and as evidenced by your latest release; you know how to use it!
B007UW9WOQ|5.0|When my husband put this documentary on TV, I kept telling him to turn the \\"stupid sushi show about expensive sushi\\" off. But quickly I was immersed in the show that was much more than sushi. It was actually about learning how to be patient, how to love your job (sometimes forcefully), and devoting your life to the mastery of one skill to absolute perfection. In the end, I thoroughly enjoyed the documentary and would recommend it to people who want to learn a valuable life lesson about patience and mastery, a rarity in our flippant American society where the younger generation today are more about changing jobs than sticking it out and mastering it.
B007GCY8FS|3.0|I have read all of Lee child's books and I will continue to read his new ones; but A Wanted Man just did not measure up to Mr. Child's talent. While reading the first third of the novel, I became bored to tears; and the plot did not show me too much after that.  Reacher continues to dazzle with his very superior skills.  Just once I would love to see Reacher sleep thru his internal clock that he visually set for an hour and a half.  And 3 houre later he wakes up. I gave 3 stars as the plot did come together.I guess it was really an average book.
B00030DEQE|5.0|Arrived on time in good condition. No extra half height adapter. Looks new. Included software CD. It installed easy in a pci slot in my old Windows XP PC. I downloaded the newest drivers and sowftware from Intel and installed them and the software. I plugged in a Cat 6 ethernet cable to it and to my gigabite router. It shows to be a gigabite connection on my PC. Everything went fast and easy. I had to tweak the software because it wasn't letting my PC go to standby. I didn't notice any faster internet speed, I only have 30 meg internet. I haven't tried moving a big file to my back up drive conntected to my gigabite router USB 2.0, but small MP3 files move fast. I'm glad I made the change, and bought Intel. I would buy again.
B005D9MUWY|1.0|This app does not install all the way on my razr maxx HD with ICS. Please fix this issue asap.
B009NQKXYK|3.0|Decent storyline but does not answer all the questions.  I am sure this is being set up as a sequel but this could have been a much better movie if faster paced and got to the thick of the plot quicker.
B0052RDHTM|5.0|Before reading this book my knowledge of what lead up to World War I and how America became involved was at best sketchy.  Even though this was a novel and some \\"poetic license\\" was taken, I found it interesting, informative and captivating.  Those prim and proper aristocrats were not so prim and proper at all. It was one of those books that you start reading and you don't want to put down until the end and you wish it wasn't over when you finished.  I look forward to the second book in this trilogy which will carry the characters into World War II.

B0000BVME4|4.0|This was a present for my mother for Christmas and she loved it and listen to it now. She wont even let famiily around it as well.
0316228532|1.0|I read 2/3 of this book hoping it would get better but it never did.  There are many boring characters and I quite frankly decided I didn't care what happened to any of them.  I love reading good books but this is not one of them.  I am sorry to have wasted my time trying to read this one.
B009RI4FRU|1.0|This movie was made for perverts and weirdos. If you're a normal person, don't waste your money on this trash.
B001VNB54A|5.0|Amazing how people are comparing the European theater to the Pacific. BoB and TP can't be compared: like the comparison to the apple and the orange. YOU JUST CAN'T DO IT. Anyways with that aside this series is great and you should definitley buy it and watch it.
B0071R43MG|4.0|If you love Satch, then you're gonna love this. It's the first high def production for him.  My only beef is that the base is so strong in the venue that it shakes the cameras so much that it makes it very noticeable. I can tell it's the base because the vibrations follow the beat of the music. It's more of an annoyance than anything else but I've never seen this on any other concert video.
B006OCM0G0|4.0|I love Restaurant Story as well as all the other &quot;Story&quot; games and would have given this a 5 star rating except I got suckered into trying the Halloween version for a few gems and am now stuck with it as uninstalling it does not remove the Halloween theme. The Halloween version over-writes the original Restaurant Story but there was no warning that it would do so because they made it sound like a new and separate game. Very aggravating and deceptive. However, I am still giving the game a favorable review because I like the game play. I suppose I'll just have to tolerate the Halloween theme until they put out a different theme. Hoping that will be soon. (Hint, hint TeamLava!)
B0086700CM|5.0|I love this game. I cant ever put it down. I have it on every handheld device that I have.
B008LV8TSU|4.0|I enjoyed this book immensely!  I have owned the movie for a few years now and after so many times watching the film it became my favorite of the Studio Ghibli films available.  I had to read the book and have wanted to for quite a while.  I consider the book and the movie two different animals but like them each(very much so) individually.  I kind of like that they were different from one another.  While reading, I still had the SG images in my head with DWJ's characters.
B0096HIEE2|3.0|I would recommend it just because the dancing was great, the guys bodies were awesome and they were oh so good looking but the movie itself was just ok.
6304907648|5.0|This was a thriller when I first saw it and remains so even though I know how it ends.  I enjoy the thrill without all the excess blood and gore.  A great movie for the Halloween month.
B008J9EYFG|5.0|From the first curious listen, i was knocked out by the stripped, bare beauty of this album.<br />Gone are the electronic flourishes, that for me, sometimes distracted from the great music Beth<br />was creating.<br />Instead, Orton bares her soul with some of her most gorgeous vocal performances, and equally<br />riveting, sparse acoustic guitar arrangements.<br />In many ways, this record feels like a throwbook to the 60's and 70's, where ideas were more<br />free-flowing and engaging.<br />There is a strong folky, intimate feel to the material as well, in stellar songs like,<br />\\"State of Grace\\" and \\"Poison Tree.\\"<br /><br />Motherhood has done Beth good, judging by the maturity & craft of \\"Sugaring Season.\\"<br />Quite easily, her best work yet.
B0008ENHUI|5.0|This is a great movie for any older family member and surprisingly young people who like to see the human will prove out.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love this app! makes it so much easier not to have to go through the Internet! nice app pintrest!!!!
B000HWZ4CA|5.0|This is a great movie for anyone who likes war movies.  I got this for my dad and then he and my brothers sat together and enjoyed it (a way to keep the men happy at family gatherings).
B0034CNSFU|5.0|A very concise, and thorough collection of his very best music.  As someone who recently turned-on to this man's music I can truly recommend this as one of the best best-of's I've ever heard.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|Just as great as all the other books written by Mr. Rjordan in this series. Most comparable to the Percy Jackson and the Battle of the Labyrinth. If you liked any of the other Percy Jackson books you will love this one as well.
B00991TCOG|5.0|un superbe album que j'attendais depuis longtemps livré en 15 jours (livraison rapide vu que je vis dans le nord de la France)
B000QCS8TW|5.0|This book naturally gets a lot of credit for being a great fantasy story. The \\"fantasy\\" parts are played low-key for a long time, letting the other factors come to a head first, but the book definitely earns its \\"fantasy\\" genre moniker in time. What the book is really great at, though, it its primary focus: politics. This book was even discussed in Foreign Policy! Martin does an amazing job of showing how complicated, gritty, and ruthless medieval politics were. Naive characters simply do not last long in this world; the cunning and more vicious are the ones who survive the cutthroat business that is the \\"game of thrones.\\" If you are a fan of medieval politics this is definitely a book to pick up. I also suggest the \\"Crusader Kings\\" games, though they are not grounded in fantasy. My only knock is the price; I picked this up at a store in Manhattan for the same price as the Kindle version.
B006HTUZ1C|5.0|Tetris with a mathematical twist. Addicting and fun. Can take some time to complete a game, and you may find yourself spending time doing this instead of more productive activities...Worth a dollar.
B009HUB40Y|5.0|I really am enjoying this app its lots of fun and has great graphics. I would recommend this game to everyone.
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|the best game ever.I love how you can .......this g&agrave;me stinks (this game stinks) there is no pony of this game
B000FCK65W|5.0|Beautifully written. The hopefullness underpining all the struggles of the mther and daughter explains alot about the immigrant experience at the turn of the last century.
B009NPKTN6|1.0|Great concept for a movie, but the plot gets 1/5 and the songs, which I generally liked, had that awful canned sound that one encounters in so many terrible TV shows(i.e. Glee)  It's ironic to me in that if you are from the group of people who actually liked the music in its heyday (poison, def leppard) I'd find it hard to believe you like the genre of work spawned from those involved in the creation of this movie (Mia Michaels, Adam Shankman, etc) and thus the movie itself.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|its f in tight<br />I love this app and if u have free time download this here app solve all ur needs
B009G8GRX6|3.0|Too much electronic music, not enough of the awesome riffs that made their other albums so good.  Maybe it will grow on me.
1423140605|5.0|[[ASIN:1423140605 The Mark of Athena (Heroes of Olympus, Book 3)]] is such an exciting book to read. It is filled with non-stop action, mystery and slight romance from beginning to end, with Percy and his crew getting into heaps of trouble and fighting their way out of them. One thing I like about this book is that even though they succeed in solving the problems they are dealt with; each problem is solved in a unique way. All the characters have a special part and the spot light isn't on Percy only. Each of the characters have very interesting personalities that makes this book so funny.<br /><br />This book is truly a masterpiece but I recommend reading book 1 and book 2 if you truly want to get the whole story and if u really don't want to miss anything... start with the Percy Jackson & the Olympians Series first... each and every book in both these series are very exciting
0316228532|5.0|This book was absolutely fantastic. As I was about to enter my own review, I caught the title of another one: \\"A searing social commentary.\\" How very apt.<br /><br />True to Rowling form, the characters were fascinating and well-developed, and her writing style continues to draw you in for more.<br /><br />Anyone looking for some \\"light reading\\" or something a bit more shallow should perhaps skip over this book.<br /><br />The people who didn't like this book were looking for something more like Harry Potter... and as fantastic as Harry Potter was, this definitely isn't it.<br /><br />I can't wait to see what else she's got in store for us.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love this app. it is awesome to pass the time with. I travel a lot and I play this game on the airplane every time. awesome app!
B000UZPIAW|4.0|'Welcome to my nightmare.'<br /><br />On December 23, 1987 Nikki Sixx, bassist from Motley Crue, overdosed on heroin and was pronounced dead, but was miraculously revived by paramedics with two injections of adrenalin to the heart. The Heroin Diaries are his personal diary entries the year leading up to this day.<br /><br />'My bones were shaking...my heart was pounding...I thought I was going to explode. I'm glad I have you to talk to, to write this down...I tried to keep it all together, but then I gave in to the madness and became one with my insanity...'<br /><br />Dealing with depression and a troubling childhood on top of his addictions, The Heroin Diaries is a brutal and raw recollection of life in a downward spiral but was nothing less than fascinating. Fascinating, in that he's still alive today. December 23, 1987 was not his only encounter with death and certainly didn't prevent him from staying away from drugs completely afterwards but it set in motion the changes he undergoes to get his life under control.<br /><br />'I can't find a way out of this hole. i would like to say to myself, If you're in a hole, put down the shovel, but I can't.'<br /><br />I burned through it in record time; I was fascinated, appalled, and beyond shocked with each page. This was a brutally honest depiction of the life of an addict, and I applaud him for having the strength to put this out there for all to see. I loved the various pictures, illustrations, and especially the current statements from people (that are still living) that were witnesses to the events that took place. Not what I would consider an 'easy read' but is definitely worth your time.
B0002IQNAG|5.0|I have to say, being a die hard DOTD fan, I've owned all versions in every media style available. But when I saw that this had all versions plus a huge behind the camera documentary, multiple movie commentary and never before seen photos, even a collectors copy of DOTD graphic novel.. part I I'm in DOTD heaven, if there is such a place. I'm so pleased that I can find and purchase \\"hard to find \\" movies to add to my ever growing collection. Thanks Amazon.com
1439152802|5.0|'It was the liquid silver flash Laurel would always remember. The way sunlight caught the metal blade, and the moment was briefly beautiful.'<br /><br />In 1959, when Laurel was sixteen years old she watched as a stranger walked up her driveway, said hello to her mother, before her mother stabbed him to death. But the man wasn't a stranger at all because before he died she heard him speak:<br />\\"Hello, Dorothy,\\" the man said. \\"It's been a long time.\\"<br /><br />When the police interviewed her mother, Laurel admits to seeing everything. Her mother didn't do anything wrong, that the stranger had attacked her and she had no choice but to do what she had done. Nothing more was ever said about the man's death and Laurel never asked but she the memories of that day never left her.<br /><br />Fifty years later, Laurel's mother has been hospitalized so she returns to her childhood home to be with her. Returning only revives the memories but this time she's determined to finally find the answers to the mystery that has plagued her for almost her entire life.<br /><br />The story flashes back and forth between 1940 and present day. As Laurel begins uncovering answers to her mother's past, the truth begins to unfold. There is so much that can be said but shouldn't for fear of ruining the story. Definitely one that truly needs to be experienced to be fully appreciated. Suffice it to say, it was an incredible mystery with intriguing and amazingly well-developed characters; a definite treat.<br /><br />The immensity of the revelation at the end truly took my breath away. That moment when all is revealed and all the unanswered questions are finally given resolution and you finally see it all in its finality? Oh, the feelings! This book made me feel so much and it was intense, amazing, bittersweet and so poignant. Reading something with such intricate detailing, intersecting storylines that blended beautifully, and an ending I never could have possibly imagined... this was a real gem. I won't be forgetting this story for a long time to come.em. I won't be forgetting this story for a long time to come.
B000XUBFE2|1.0|This was a book we read in a book club, otherwise, I would not have finished the book.  It had a good story line, but found the writing to be very strange.  Not my type of book.
B0052RDHTM|5.0|What a great way to learn history. I can't wait to read the sequels now. Ken Follett never disappoints his readers. His characters are so real that you feel like you know them by the end of the book. Now, let's see what happens to the next generation.
B001T9O6X8|5.0|Amazing story. Filled with hope, facts, and inspiration. Anyone who has had anything similar or who knows someone who has had something similar should read/listen to this book. So much makes sense now...
B00910Y1OQ|4.0|I dunno, I don't pay any attention to the story, and I don't get the point of tracing the little paths every few rounds, but the actual tile swapping game is good
B003VIWO8Y|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed hearing Dave's tale, and read it completely it two sittings.  You can tell he is an intelligent guy telling a story from the heart.  Although you learn in the book, intelligent and smart aren't necessarily the same thing.  He, self-admittedly, made a multitude of mistakes during his life, but eventually learns from them.<br /><br />I would have liked to hear a little more about work in the studio and more about what was happening during the release of later work.  Unfortunately multiple album releases get glossed over towards the end.  It was still a great read, and I recommend it highly.
0061091480|5.0|I orders this book because I lost my original copy. It is very enlightening. It was very helpful in my life years ago when I first read it and I have purchase other books by Dr. Wayne Dyer as well.

B007ZGO7EM|4.0|I like this app.  It helps me a lot with my math homework!  The only problem is that it is hard to press the keys. Overall this a good app if you are not good at mental math.
B008GVD6D8|5.0|Loved this book! Way better than the first! Ties up a lot of loose ends from the first book. Totally addicted to this :)
B009NQKPUW|4.0|Interesting prequel to the Alien series that creates plausible reasons for looking for the humanoids who seem to have planted us on Earth...like a garden then decide to turn on us when we find them. Curious morphing of squid creature that will become the Alien in later series. No glaring continuity breaks with enough in common to complete your Alien trilogy.<br />Cinematography and scene construction is cohesive and characters are developed well.

B00881VLCE|4.0|Fun game but the puzzle pieces are placed talmost under the game ads which forces you to click the ads almost everytime you take a puzzle piece from the bin. Other than that the game is fun.
B000SW2F80|3.0|The tales are cute and clever, but not so scary that you can't watch them just before bedtime (unless you're 6).  Not laugh-out-loud funny, but humorous.  If you're a diehard horror movie fan, I'd pass, but if you're just looking for light entertainment, they're perfect.
B005K17RU0|5.0|I love this app. It is great for trips and daily use. I use it quite often to check the forecast.
B005IQZB14|5.0|I bought this book on the recommendation of a friend.  I just can't put it down!  I'm only half way through and I can already tell you its a great book.  I've already laughed with her and cried with her, and I know there is more to come.  This author is down to earth, and tells it like she sees it.

B008673ZAQ|2.0|I definitely had a hard time reading this book and staying with it.  I did, for the sake of Bared, but never really felt like the book \\"did it\\" for me.  It felt like we were moving from one subject to the next without really a seamless transition.  I feel like I could have gotten to know Eva and Gideon much more intimately in this book, but came out lacking.  Not sure if I will buy book 3!  I probably will just to complete the series, but was, all in all, mostly disappointed in this book.
B0063GORYU|4.0|good way to wind down at the end of the day.<br />I enjoy a good game of spider before bed.

0307719774|5.0|This is a fabulous way to journal.  It is a quick answer to a daily question. The best part is you answer the same question on that date for five years.  You get to see where you have been and where you are now.  Love this journal!!

B005CRQ2IU|5.0|Thought provoking and a rollicking adventure through the dark under belly of the American city as well as the darkness of the human mind. Completely fascinating, a must-read.
1475143389|5.0|The nutritional information in this book alone was worth buying to me. Teaches good form and very detailed with the workout. I definitely recommend this book.
B001KVZ6HK|4.0|Although I do not own a 3d Television, I purchased this product because it was such a great deal.  I paid $19.99 for this 4 disc set. I received this item within the days promised.  I would recommend this product.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|This is te best trilogy i have ever read in my entire life! It's the best love story (yes, believe it or not it's a love story) ever written.. Twilight fans: edward cullen and jacob WHO?!.. Reeead the three books! You will not regret it! Just an advise! DO NOT READ THEM IN PUBLIC! =P
B009NQKPUW|4.0|If you didn't know, this is a prequel to the Aliens movies, and serves as insight as to where the Xenomorphs came from. I really enjoyed this one.
B002B0NAV8|5.0|Great introductory album for this new listener. I've always been a fan of the heavier alt rock and keep my eyes open for new tunes. My tastes vary from SSPU to Neko Case to Foo Fighters. I must admit it took a few listens to really enjoy this album but now I'm hooked. The First song that caught my attention was 'Around the Fur'; the drum beat and guitar are awesome! In my opinion, many songs are reminiscent of the Finch 'What it is to Burn' album (which I thoroughly enjoyed wearing out years ago). The only thing I hate about this album is the 'hidden' track that you have to wait for 30 minutes to start.
B00683JK9K|1.0|Was looking forward to using this app, but it proved to be a big disapointment. This app just doesn't work, first of all I cannot fit the right side of the puzzle on my screen also am unable to rotate puzzle pieces. Oh did I mention a few pieces are missing ; making it impossible to finish.I plan on keeping this app with hope upgrades will solve the problems. I find the pictures very pretty.
B009NPKTN6|1.0|I love musicals (theatre or movie), and had great hopes for this piece.  What I found, instead, was an insipid bit of writing with mediocre acting (excepting Alec Baldwin).  I was very disappointed.
0425263916|4.0|I received my copy from Penguin Books through Book Geeks:<br /><br /> \\"He was my drug, and I had no desire to kick the habit.\\"<br /><br />\\"I'm caught up with you, Eva.\\" With his head tilted back, Gideon pulled me down for the sweetest of kisses, his firm lips moving gently beneath mine. \\"I'd kill for you,\\" he whispered, \\"give up everything I own for you . . . but I won't give you up.\\"<br /><br />And so the story of Eva and Gideon, which started in \\"Bared to You\\", continues. Magnetically drawn together yet incapable of communicating and trusting each other they stumble along, moving from sexual bliss to emotional breakdown and back again. Both carry deep and debilitating pain from the past. And while Eva shares her pain with Gideon she is full of insecurities and finds it impossible to trust him. Gideon, on the other hand, can't talk about that which hurts him most or anything else emotionally charged. And his silence fuels all of Eva's doubts and insecurities, making her doubt herself and their future as a couple. They are working on it though, going to relationship counseling and making allowances for each other. A blissful and very erotic weekend by the seaside seems to bring them much closer together only for Gideon to almost completely withdraw from Eva. Suddenly he misses meetings with her, is photographed out and about with his former fianc&eacute; and while he claims not to want to lose her, Eva can't help but feel that she's being side-lined. Will Eva discovering why Gideon is behaving the way he is bring these two desperate souls back together, or will it break them apart forever?<br /><br />There is actually a lot more happening in this book but sharing more of the story-line would involve huge spoilers, so I won't. Because the story is told only from Eva's perspective the reader has as little idea why her lover is behaving the way he is as she does which enhances the tension in the story and turns it almost into a mystery at times. I wouldn't want to spoil that for any reader.<br /><br />I feel a bit ambivalent about this story. There were a lot of times I felt totally frustrated with the characters. This book is almost an object lesson in what not to look for in a relationship, you could almost call it a cautionary tale. These two characters couldn't be more wrong for each other if they tried, and yet they so obviously belong together. It is a very confusing situation for the reader because you no longer know what to wish for, what a happy ending would actually look like. It does make for a fascinating roller-coaster of a reading experience though. I was turning the pages compulsively, in a rush to find out what would happen next, how a situation would resolve itself or what on earth might be going on.<br /><br />This is a well written book, an easy and smooth read. It is also a book with characters that come alive on the pages, characters with depth and development. And that is not just true for Eva and Gideon. There are other characters on the side-lines who play just enough of a role in the story to turn this into more than just a sensual, if troubled, romance. And those minor characters also make it possible for the reader to come to a better understanding of the troubled lovers.<br /><br />This book is dedicated to Nora Roberts and on at least one occasion while reading this book I was strongly reminded of Eve Dallas, the main character in the mysteries she writes as J.D. Robb. When Eva asks Gideon if there is any part of New York he doesn't at least partially own, the words might as well have come from Eve Dallas' mouth as she addresses her own billionaire, Roarke.<br /><br />In short I would describe this as a fascinating - at times frustrating -, sexy and gripping story. I'm looking forward to May when \\"Entwined in You\\" will be published and I will be able to find out how it is all going to endfor any reader.<br /><br />I feel a bit ambivalent about this story.

I was turning the pages compulsively, in a rush to find out what would happen next, how a situation would resolve itself or what on earth might be going on.<br /><br />This is a well written book, an easy and smooth read. It is also a book with characters that come alive on the pages, characters with depth and development. And that is not just true for Eva and Gideon. There are other characters on the side-lines who play just enough of a role in the story to turn this into more than just a sensual, if troubled, romance. And those minor characters also make it possible for the reader to come to a better understanding of the troubled lovers.<br /><br />This book is dedicated to Nora Roberts and on at least one occasion while reading this book I was strongly reminded of Eve Dallas, the main character in the mysteries she writes as J.D. Robb. When Eva asks Gideon if there is any part of New York he doesn't at least partially own, the words might as well have come from Eve Dallas' mouth as she addresses her own billionaire, Roarke.<br /><br />In short I would describe this as a fascinating - at times frustrating -, sexy and gripping story. I'm looking forward to May when \\"Entwined in You\\" will be published and I will be able to find out how it is all going to end
1600595871|5.0|I love this book! I had the first book some years ago and was able to use almost all of the bindings in my projects. I was even able to teach some of them to my first graders when I was still teaching. This new book is a combination of Alisa Golden's first and second books and all I can say is that she makes sure her readers can duplicate exactly what they see in the book. The instructions are clear and the results are always great. If you're a crafter, if you like making your own books and art journals, or if you're a teacher and you want a more fun way to compile your students' masterpieces (both written or drawn), you have to have this book!
B0073U2FB2|2.0|Emile Hirsch, what happened to you?  You're playing a douchy wannabe software entrepreneur whose best lines involve flirting with a flight attendant over airplane-cell phone propaganda.  We're only a few minutes into this movie and I already finding myself disliking your protagonist.  I've seen you quiet and soulful in Into the Wild (2007), humorously innocent in the amazing The Girl Next Door (2004), credibly authoritative in Alpha Dog (2006)...and now this?  Did you lose a bet or just piss off one too many directors with vegan, gluten-free, organic catering demands?  Simply accepting this role and this script was a failure before the cameras even started rolling.  We'll call this strike one.<br /><br />Anyway, this software designer and his partner are on a business trip to Moscow to market a social networking app for navigating the club circuit in any major city in the world.  [Why did they need to go to Moscow for this?  Because it was cheaper to film the movie there.]  Hirsch plays the more laid back, carefree partner who is always telling his business-oriented friend to relax.  Not even ten minutes into this flick they are double-crossed by a third party and ousted out of their own deal.  This really deviates from the standard formula.  The Hostel series, The Chernobyl Diaries, Wrong Turn, Wolf Creek and The Cabin in the Woods rely more simply on a group of friends going on a vacation.  It's simple but it works.  You never find yourself saying \\"what's the point in them being in Moscow for this business deal\\" and the movie's credibility is maintained until the real fun starts when the players begin to drop one by one to whatever the random malevolent force the writers dreamed up.  That's strike two.<br /><br />So our boys go out clubbing to drink away their failed business venture and meet up with two cuties.  They seem to get along when suddenly there's a world-scale power outage and countless energy-based life forms fall from the sky like snow-flaky embers aglow with Tinkerbell's fairy dust.  They start incinerating people like vampires to Blade's silver katana, people start running and screaming, and we're only fifteen minutes into the movie.  Well, at least we didn't have to suffer through the business deal plot any more.<br /><br />As people scream and turn into aerosol compost our heroes, now numbering five with the addition of the shark who screwed them over on their app idea,  hide in a restaurant store room. A week after the invisible, incinerating invasion began, they emerge to go to the US Embassy...because they wouldn't have been charred, right?  Oh, and the slick douchebag has turned into an annoying high strung coward.  Those characters are so annoying and they never get killed off as fast as you'd like.<br /><br />The streets of Moscow have turned into an I Am Legend, soulless dust bowl of abandoned cars and ghostly edifices.  Hirsch leads the way as they remain ever vigilant.  Because these energy-based aliens activate electronic devices (i.e., lights) when they are present, our heroes learn to travel when it's safest: night.<br /><br />At one point Hirsch avoids detection by standing perfectly still as the creature just strolled by unaware on the other side of a window.  Considering that these things see lifeforms like glowing fireballs of infrared, making them extremely obvious, I think that moment of idiocy makes for strike three.  They can't see through glass or metal cages?  Whatever!  Now I have to watch these idiots walking around like glass shield-bearing knights.  Just stupid!<br />Along the way their group grows by two, one of which is an annoying Russian girl with such memorable lines as \\"It's okay, I'm tough\\" and \\"I am not a kid!\\"  Barf!  I hope she dies next.  But luckily the other addition, a wacked out electrician, invented a Ghostbusters microwave gun to combat our electric invaders.<br /><br />I guess the effects were tolerable.  But how many times can you entertain me with people gettingjerked into the air for a second and then getting turned to spiraling cinders by some invisible dust devil alien?  They shatter glass and detonate doors--boring.  After they disintegrated the first few people and a dog the kills got boring.  Our heroes start freaking out every time a breeze kicks up some debris and then the \\"dumb\\" really hits the fan.  They meet dumber tough-talking characters who fight the aliens in dumb ways wearing dumb outfits amid ridiculously dumb scenarios and give dumb speeches about preserving every human life they can.  Just truckloads and truckloads of dumb!  Oh, and eventually you get to see these aliens and, you guessed it, they look dumb!  The worst effects in the movie were dedicated to showing us what the aliens truly look like without their invisibility shield--they look like some weird floating head monster from Doom.  It's most upsettingly dumb when Hirsch kills an alien by throwing a charred piece of another dead alien at it.  One throw?  Really?  Climax-fail!  Sorry, we're out of strikes.<br /><br />In the end I wished everyone died.  The quality of this movie actually decreased as the running time wore on and, accordingly, I turned on the characters more and more with every passing scene.  I won't say skip this movie.  But if you choose to watch it, watch and mock it with friends.jerked into the air for a second and then getting turned to spiraling cinders by some invisible dust devil alien?

B00563M11M|5.0|Its a long time since I've sat for so long reading a book without break. Keeps you wondering what the next page will bring and rarely disappointed! Thoroughly enjoyed it!
0385535147|5.0|I read this book straight through on our first cold, rainy Sunday of the season.  It was gripping, suspenseful, intriguing and impossible to put down.  The sentence structure was simple and there were no difficult words so it lent itself to a quick read, especially for me after just finishing Cloud Atlas!  Would highly recommend.
B000FCKC4C|5.0|This is the book which could change your life forever if you grasp the concepts, symbols and metaphors properly. The storyline presents a journey which every hero goes through in his life and all the challenges, obstacles and achievements are common to every man who pursues his dream. This book is so amazing and I would recommend it to anyone who is fearless of the obstacles in life and who is willing to die for what he wants out of life..<br />-Thilina
146920231X|5.0|Well written. Keeps you interested while being thought provoking and informative. I found it inspiring as well. Subsequently we went to one of his free seminars and paid for another.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|I enjoy the game and feel that it's overpriced. That doesn't mean it isn't worth five stars. And what's the problem with ads for their other products? It takes less than a second to bypass them, if your not interested. I have the new kindle fire hd and the product itself is one nonstop, tacky ad generator. The original fire had some class. This  version is so in your face it's sickening. I get mad when my hardware comes with nonstop, built in third party advertisements but software makers should be able to mention their other wares without being scolded for doing so.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|this game is the bomb I was so happy to find out this app store had because I have been playing it on my ipad. it changes to the theme of the up coming holiday. it is like temple run but better. get this game.
B007IXWL2C|3.0|GOod book to kill time and relax.  A bit repetitive at times. You  get tired of the use  of some words. A thesaurus would come in hand.
B005SEKMH4|5.0|The author writes a readable, engaging book, but with enough science in it to help you understand something about what is going on in the brain at a bio-chemical level.  I'm really enjoying it!
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|Loved this film in theaters and now have the chance to bring it home to my home theater. Love all the extra features and all the forms of the movie all in one.
B009NQKPUW|5.0|The Blu-ray version is really of high quality. The movie is very well made and the extras are worth watching
B00943SQCI|5.0|Its a very awesome movie...especially the ending where the doc was awaken in the water from the blood donation.  That was cool!!!
B007THA4FI|2.0|The new Rowling book grinds on and on. A slow read at best. The teenage characters are well developed and Krystal in particular is very well written /compelling. But the story and the adults? Boring.
0399157565|5.0|I'm a Cornwell fan but loved the surprise ending. Loved that she updated info on the main characters to remind me about them. I have a medical background but think she writes for anyone to understand the technical info.  And those who are upset with the updates should realize that not everyone has read her books previously. Can't wait for the next one.
0446580848|4.0|I enjoyed reading \\"The Panther\\", and appreciated what I saw as an attempt to provide the reader with information regarding Yemen, al qaeda and the middle east.  It was fun to question my husband about said information, to see what he thought in relation to his multiple deployments in other parts of that area.  In fact, there were quite a few things that I read in the book that my husband has said previously.  In my opinion, it's important to know as much as possible about \\"extremists\\", so I think that the information provided is very useful.<br /><br />On the other hand, I was also a bit bored by some of the \\"information dumps\\" and felt that perhaps there was *too* much detailed explanation.  I can see that in order to understand why the differing tribes and governments act the way they do, one must first be informed about their beliefs and motivations, but it seemed like a lot to absorb.<br /><br />John Corey is one of my favorite all-time characters.  He is, indeed, sarcastic.  He always has been, and hopefully he always will be; I think that he's pretty hilarious.  I know that some readers found his constant wisecracking annoying at best, but after living with a Marine for a long time, I have been told that \\"inappropriate\\" (sometimes downright \\"morbid\\") humor is normal when some people are in dangerous or stressful situations.  It's a coping mechanism, and while I have never experienced combat, apparently it's very common -- and can be necessary.  Regardless, I find Corey's humor to be entertaining and and think that he's written very intelligently.<br /><br />I also love Kate, Corey's wife, and think that she is written as a strong, intelligent woman.  (She also gets annoyed at John's wisecracking every now and then.)  To add to the cast of wits, in my opinion, Paul Brenner makes an excellent addition to the core group.  He and John work well together, in spite of any misgivings each might have, and they clearly have much in common.  It was great to see the pieces fall into place as they worked together to find their enemies... even the unexpected ones.  He, too, had some wisecracks that played off of John's, so be alerted that there are plenty of jokes.<br /><br />Bulus was not what I expected, and could have benefited from some Diabolical and Frightening classes.  I thought he was an adequate villain, but not a great one; to me, he needed a bigger part, somehow.<br /><br />And Chet gave me the willies.<br /><br />In all, I really liked \\"The Panther\\" and would recommend it to others who like a LOT of sarcasm, a well-researched and informative book, and who have enjoyed John Corey et al in the past.
B009NPKTN6|5.0|Loved it! Even my 12 year old daughter, wife and 86 year old mother loved it.we watched it 3 times in a row.
B006HAPY26|4.0|Kept me interested throughout the book I enjoyed this book a lot a must read for any boy or girl!
B00992CF6W|5.0|This Game is meant to be on everyones touchscreen device! I just wish that we could make mods and have the items that the PC version has. Still is an incredible game. Cant live without it!<br /><br />(Use on Kindle Fire!)
B004VMUS9G|5.0|I'm really pleased with this app. it never fails to get me up in the morning unlike my phone. lots of bad experiences with ancient phone in which I get in trouble, but this app usually saves me from that. It would be cool if they put in a white noise / sleep sound setting though.... *hint hint*
