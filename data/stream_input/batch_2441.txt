B00005UNCL|5.0|I have this movie on DVD and think it's terrific. The BluRay version is EXCEPTIONAL. The sound reproduction is beyond perfection!
B000WCDI64|5.0|Contrary to what you might think, I did buy this on purpose.  Every song is good and she's relatively coherant for the first half hour.  I do enjoy her song writing ability and her witty repartee.  You'll like it.
B0025VLELQ|4.0|I have this movie on DVD. The BluRay copy is soooo much better from the standpoint of PICTURE CLARITY & ENHANCED SOUND.
1476734941|3.0|I would recommend this book to help you understand the benefits of fasting. I is a helpful guide to getting started to eating healthy.
B004W2UBYW|5.0|I just couldn't put it down. I would go back to the book whenever I had even 5 spare minutes (I read it on the phone. Thanks Kindle on Android. Oops, it wasn't an iPhone). There's not much I can contribute to the analysis of the literature or the character, but I want to say this - for the first 25% or so of the book I found myself laughing hard on a few occasions at public places (train basically).
B00ALYY6ZA|4.0|Works for me. First two or three fast days are difficult but after that initial time gets easier.  I am losing about a pound per week. Looking forward to the next day after fasting gives you the incentive to keep it up
0767817478|5.0|What's a sham  are  the  negative reviews. I say this in almost every review. You can not compare movies. For legal reasons they can't use the same Godzilla, but the overall concept is still the same.<br /><br />As for the monster himself, some complaints saying he doesn't look real. It could be because it isn't, but looks pretty good. I'd compare it/them to the dinosaurs in Jurassic Park. Very similar in realism.<br /><br />It was an action packed film from the get go, which I liked. The special effects were  fantastic. Yeah some say they were  terrible, but Ive seen some terrible B movie effects in movies, this was great. Mind you this film was  made in 1998, yes that's 14 years ago. Can't find any better effects than this.<br /><br />As an unbiased reviewer I can tell you this film is great one of my favs and I normally dislike these kind of films due to their cheesyness.This one surprised me<br /><br />I watched this on Amazon Prime HD so I have no issues with the rain/darkness.
1400069742|5.0|If, like me, you've always been puzzled and almost ashamed at how long it took America to enter WWII then this is not a book to be missed. I've read brief and very dry explanations for why this happened. I've heard angry allegations of anti-Semitism and waffling on the part of the Roosevelt administration. But for a clear, well written and logical explanation of what exactly happened in those days when America hung back from entering the war, even as country after country fell to the Nazis, this has to be one of the best, easily approachable books written on the subject.<br /><br />The book begins with a beatific image of Charles Lindberg, American Hero and modern Galahad, slipping into the Smithsonian museum to simply look at his plane, The Spirit of St. Louis, as it hangs suspended from the ceiling of the main Hall. If all you know about Lindberg is that he flew this little plane cross-Atlantic and became a modern hero, then this book is going to be a surprise for you.<br /><br />As most things political, there was great complexity as to why America stood on the sidelines and resisted Churchill's request for involvement in the war. The provisions for neutrality legislation passed by American Congress would not allow the US to sell arms to any country at war and the house and Senate would simply not repeal the law. Lynne Olson does a magnificent job explaining the logic and the quagmire that American politicians were stuck in as they debated and resisted involvement in a war not yet their own.  The people were split into Isolationists and Interventionists: those who advocated fighting only for our own nation and no one else, and those who insisted that America could not evade International responsibility.<br /><br />The author has done a magnificent job bringing alive the time period and the sheer vitriol that people felt for those with opposing points of view regarding involvement in the war. She focuses her attention quite solidly on Lindberg (or perhaps her most interesting chapters are about Lindberg) and his impact and influence on the Isolationists. She depicts Lindberg quite harshly, but perhaps more accurately, compared to many other books about him. His life in Europe, his opinions of the Germans and how he may have been deceived by them regarding their capabilities in aviation are a fascinating part of the book. Lindberg's opinions have far reaching consequences because he is in the national spotlight and Olson explains exactly how his opinions contributed to American lethargy regarding the war. She also does not hesitate to show how he contributed to his own downfall from American Hero to one of the most vilified public figures of the time.<br /><br />There are fascinating characters in this book. Wendell Wilkie, FDR, Churchill, Hoover, etc but I found myself most intrigued by Lindberg and his family. Lindberg's wife, Anne Morrow, easily ignored in all this, has a powerful voice in the book. Lindberg is a fascinatingly flawed human being whose ignorance and stubbornness cause untold harm. There are points in the book where it seems that what Olson should have done is simply written a book about the Lindberg family and their influence on the war!<br /><br />There are certain sections of the book that are quite dry especially since there isn't one particular character or chain of events to follow. There are chapters on Anti Semitism in America, the Yale students who were isolationists, the efforts made by British citizens in America to court support for Britain in the war, etc. For me this is the kind of book that takes a month or two to read since it is a heavy read on its own and is jam packed with historical details and connections that need to be made. What comes through in almost every page is how the issue of entering the war or not managed to split the American populace into two very angry groups; neither of which was willing to see or concede the others' point of view. The nasty atmosphere in the politics aswell as normal life is oddly similar to what we can see even today and the book holds up a mirror to the past as well as to the present.<br /><br />I would highly recommend this book to anyone interested in American History, Charles Lindberg and WWII.well as normal life is oddly similar to what we can see even today and the book holds up a mirror to the past as well as to the present.<br /><br />I would highly recommend this book to anyone interested in American History, Charles Lindberg and WWII.
1442346272|5.0|The best story of the most successful entrepreneur of our time. Outstanding audiobook. Saved it on my computer for listening again and again.
B0086O4FLC|5.0|How does he do it? Pat Metheny plays something like 250 shows a year, teaches, and on top of all that cranks out one amazing album after another. I was fortunate enough to see him on the Unity Band tour last year, and it was a seminal show! Chris Potter is incredible (as are the other musicians in Metheny's band). If you already like Pat, you'll love this album, and if you are not yet a fan, this is as good place as any to start. This was my fav jazz album of last year.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|I enjoy this game. I find it very cool how thee are several levels, as well as character. The fact that it updates itself is also pretty nice.
B000002GBB|4.0|The music is well known.<br />The songs are a formula.<br />The band was at its peak.<br />For a CD the quality is good to very good.
B008RA3X5E|3.0|It's a decent clock. Not really anything special but it gets me to work on time. Wish you could just cancel aland from the main screen without having to go into the alarm setup for the days that I wake before it goes of.
B0096HIEE2|1.0|What a stupid movie. I didn't buy it to see half naked men. I thought it was going to have a story line and make sense. I didn't even finish watching it. If you just want to see men then get it. If you are looking for a movie to watch, don't bother.
B0030N3O8Y|5.0|I watched every episode for each season.  I even stayed up all night a couple of times watching episodes because the ending would be so exciting I would have to keep watching! Excellent writing and acting!
B0091REZMW|4.0|fun game if you like hidden puzzles and games. wish energy would build up quicker but other then that very addicting
B00BMR5HOO|4.0|I do like this app a lot. It is very helpful for me because I like to know if it is going to be hot, cold, humid, rainy, ect. and so I won't be burning up in a long sleeve shirt or freezing in a short sleeve shirt. I do, however wish it had every day of the week hourly.
B00A757EFW|4.0|Grandchildren loves this game.  I like it to because it is a through back from the old games that I prefer much more than the ones today.
B0074MZSWW|5.0|Reminds me of the soul and blues from the late 60's - early 70's. Bands as good as Alabama Shakes are rare. This album is an instant classic and can already compete as one of the greatest debuts, or just plain greatest albums, ever recorded. This album is an absolute steal for any price!
B008MEM24S|4.0|My grandson and granddaughter loves it.  It was also a great price for it.  They think they should keep my kindle just to play this game.
B003EYVY0E|5.0|This is the best version possible for this movie. This included all the extras every bell and whistle totally with the extra cost!

B0094BB4TW|2.0|This app frequently crashes and lacks many of the functions of the iOS app. It doesn't really beat going to the FB mobile site.
B007BFSYMS|5.0|I absolutely love this app! It is so much easier to fall asleep at night with the beautiful and relaxing sounds. The app itself is super easy do use, and the sounds are absolutely amazing. To anyone who has trouble sleeping or just wants to relax, this app is a must buy.
B002DEI4NG|5.0|So, I love streaming downloads from my Cloud, which doesn't have to be dusted and the kids can't scratch and ruin.<br />I love the Gilmore Girls, ever since I stumbled upon it completely by accident while sitting in an emergency room waiting room.<br />If you don't know the Gilmore Girls already you should start at the beginning... When you meet Loralei's mother you will meet my grandmother at the same time... not the actress, but the character they wrote. That is probably one reason that this show has so much appeal for me, I didn't know enough people who had grandmothers like that, so didn't know there were a lot of people who could understand....!<br />When you come right down to it, Loralei the mom is rather selfish and intolerant, just like HER mom, but she does it differently so its hard to recognize as being the same at first. Rori, the daughter, is also being taught a lot of that, but having her eye on education and career makes her a little less in-your-face control freak. And, of course, all the women have stunning moments of goodness, which sort of helps you love them in spite of....<br />I hope you enjoy the series as much as I do. And, I just won't understand anyone who doesn't love that streaming cloud thing!

B003TXSF5C|4.0|After having read a &#34;Brief History of Time,&#34; I have a certain expectations when it comes to Science text and while enjoyable, it didn't hold up to my expectations. While I appreciate the ability to be concise, this was too short. I finished it in one sitting. It wasn't as technical as I would of liked it to be. It did seem very dumb down. it makes up for it in other ways. It got across a lot of information in a short amount of time. It explained &#34;complicated&#34; Physics issues better than a &#34;For Dummies&#34; book could have. For the price, I could have done worse. Overall I think this book was a decent book to add to my Science collection.
B000062X90|4.0|30 plus years have past since this album was on high rotation in my life. It is now back on high rotation and I'm loving every riff of it.

B008AK8FHM|4.0|Easy read.  Fun, uplifting.  It is easy to be cynical but I took this story on face value.  Listening to kids is almost always better than listening to jaded (and cynical) adults.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is an awesome game,once I start playing I can't put it down and the regular updates to different cities make sure you don't get bored, not that this is possible.

B008AK8FHM|4.0|This book really gave me a tremendous amount of hope that there is a better life after death filled with love and peace and that all things happen for a reason and even though I don't understand how or why someday I will. Really a great book.
B00A3NQNUU|4.0|This game is fun and very cool but the only thing I don't like is  it has to have internet connection but everything is cool
B003PDQEBS|5.0|Firth is an amazing actor, the direction and sensitivity of the character are superb. Understatement is a perfect means to examine this kind of pain and pathos. I loved this film.
B00A9V2JSG|4.0|It was pretty good so far I'm liking Lauren Oliver it's the first book I've read of hers. I'm reading the second book now awesome
1439102813|5.0|Startling description of the ascent into the painless situation of Alzaheimers.  Much more than an interesting read.  Most informative information about this 'disease'.
B00B49GSOS|3.0|I didn't do my homework and research this film. Knowing it was the same producers, some original cast, and director, I just went for it, expecting to see the film-maker's version of the first novel. I love these films and loved this one. But I selfishly gave it 3 stars because no one told me it was a two-parter!!!!  HP and the Deathly Hallows all over again!!! Karwa mac!!!!
B005GFPZYK|5.0|Truly an amazing read. The range of of emotions that I felt reading this book ran the entire spectrum. I highly recommend this book.
B005K17RU0|5.0|I love this app, its exactly what I'm looking for! it never randomly shuts down and the temp is accurate and the chances for rain are usually right

1449433251|4.0|Everything was brand new and wrap in packaging. The only problem is that it was really heavy. I wonder why.
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|It was a long wait, and while I'm sorry Robert Jordan wasn't here to finish it, Brandon Sanderson did a fine job of filling out this long series. I enjoyed it, and would recommend it, (the whole series) to any fantasy fan. I have read and re-read all the books, except, of course, this last one.  But I am sure that will happen.  I have also read a few of Brandon Sanderson's books, and I would recommend them, too.
0743289692|5.0|This autobiography is so pertinent in today's world.  Ayaan tells her story in a dispassionate way, but nevertheless, the harm done to her because of Islam is so troubling.  Seeing the religion through a woman's eyes is very upsetting.
B0083ZRAJS|5.0|For all, especially adults, who have seen the film but never read the book, then this is a must. The descriptions are so colourful and vivid and the story is quite engrossing.
B00004D07F|5.0|This was a great movie, I needed it for  class and it took a little long to get to me, but other than that it was an interesting movie
B007G3H8Y0|5.0|Good Music - Good Price - Good Value - and \\"extra\\" can play on Amazon's Cloud Player too!  Love the Cloud Player!  Thanks! Amazon for offering music you can play on your computer, your phone or any other device.
B002RVZV9K|5.0|Anyone who loves rock n roll like I do will appreciate this.  As an amateur guitarist I soaked up every second of this dvd from start to finish.  This documentary gives you a glimpse into the creative process of 3 of the most inventive and eclectic guitar heroes to ever record music (J.Page, the Edge, J.White).  The film is well made all around -excellent directing by D. Guggenheim and definitely worth watching for anyone who is a Led Zeppelin or U2 or White Stripes fan, or for those like myself who are fans of all three!
B009IJJ5B4|5.0|This is a refreshing series Jonny Lee Miller and Lucy Liu are excellent actors both bring a chemistry to the series that makes the viewer anxious to see the next show.  Sherlock is what I would imagine him to be and Watson is brilliantly surprising by being female. I can hardly wait for the next season.
B0091REZMW|4.0|you should be able to select what friends you want to join you instead of the app sending a general post.
B005D4YOWI|2.0|I love the Keen Newport, but this pair was way too small; they were uncomfortable tight even in bare feet. I sent them back.
B00C5W3SBE|5.0|For the life of me I cannot figure out why everyone is so upset about the 3D version not coming with 2D. There are 4 combo packs for sale and you have choices! We are supposed to be rating the movie here and it is highly entertaining, great effects and I for one can't wait to see it again!
B00B89WXYS|5.0|This whole album is worth purchasing and listening to. I rarely buy whole albums, but each track is an evolution of OneRepublic's unique and anthem driven sound.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Very seldom does the ending of the book surprise me but this one did.  Had goose bumps reading the ending!
B0090P98Z4|3.0|Fun but seems like you have to buy things to really get ahead instead of play earned items. Good graphics though.
0060007737|3.0|This is a good book, but its been rewritten from the 22 Immutable Laws of Marketing.  If you've already read that book, there's almost no need to read this one.  Most of the facts and statistics from that book are rescrubbed for this one.  Its ok and there are some new truths, but if you've read any books on branding this one doesn't offer a new punch of knowledge.  Better off buying The Origin of Brands.
B009RH9FR6|4.0|It's been a great product do far. I like how it stands horizontal or vertical. It is a very good quality product.
B00BETX5PS|4.0|The last of the James Bond films is a little long and a little dark, but overall, I think that it's a great ending to a fantastic trilogy. I think that the tone of this film is much more in line with the &#34;James Bond&#34; brand.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is fun and fun when you get to play in different places. This game is also very additive to stop playing.
1476734941|5.0|I watched Dr. Mosley's show on the Fast Diet and had to give it a try. I lost ten pounds the first week and hope to lose more. I fast on monday and thursday and have no problems with the process. 600 calories on the fast days takes getting used to, but the recipes in the book are very good and nutritious. I passed my copy on to my parents and they are going to give it a try.
B004CS7R70|3.0|They are just ok, nothing special.  The optics are not especially clear--a bit cloudy.  six more words six more words
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|I could play this game for hours.  My husband wants to eat dinner every day and this is a major interuption in my game playing.
B00BFUUMO8|1.0|I've been cheated out of so many Dino bucks from offers I accepted.  I even purchased bucks and it took a week to get them. The game is designed to make you fail.
B000HEWEJO|5.0|If you don't like this film, there may be something wrong with you (LOL)!  For those who do like it, the challenge is to hide your emotions that this film brings out of many viewers.  A timeless classic.
B005IQZB14|5.0|Great book to read.  It is a happy book and can make you laugh and a few times cry. For some reason it made me proud, like I was as strong as she was, or maybe it was because she is a girl and it was so good to hear something that a girl can do.  She is one strong lady.
B0002S943O|5.0|This concert video is one of the best you will ever see.  DM's live performances are as crisp and on-key as any of their recorded albums.  Highly recommended - wait until you see the video enhanced stage set and performance!
B008DVJMAW|1.0|They remind me of a mix of the eagles meets the ozark mountain daredevils. I know many of you won't know who the daredevils were or are but if you'll take a listen to \\"if you want to go to heaven\\" by the ozark mountain daredevils you might get the connection. Now if modern country could be like this I would still be listening to it. Sorry but I will say they have a chance at making it commercially.
B001BZRUR4|4.0|I fell in love with Markus Zusak when I read The Book Thief and was really looking forward to reading more of his creative endeavors, and I was not disappointed with I Am the Messenger. It was a great read and I really enjoyed it!  Zusak's character development embodies a richness that embraces the depths the day-to-day everybody and while the protagonist may appear to be somewhat of a loser through the eyes of modern day society, he is an unsung hero who brings out your protective instincts. You really like the guy. I did feel that the ending left me wanting something else in its place, (but what, I don't know) and that is why I rated the book 4 instead of 5 stars. A good ending is hard to find.
B00BFUUMO8|4.0|If you're a fan of Jurassic Park then you should definitely get this fun and cool game. It's so easy , and the dinosaurs are really cute. Only for people who enjoy simulators
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I got this game 20 minutes ago, and I have completed 75 boards. This game has potential to be on my top 5 favourite apps list. Absolutely fantastical. Fun for all ages. The 10 by 10 through 14 by 14 are good for experts, while 5 by 5 is great for beginners.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|Have had it for six months, never failed, set three different alarms, love it plays my songs.  Very easy to use, good job Angle Labs!!
B0063IH60K|5.0|This game is challenging and enjoyable.  Possible to spend hours playing, if you have extra time to spend.  Recommend for hours of enjoyment.

B000VWYJ86|5.0|XXXXX<br /><br />This is the final movie in the Bourne trilogy following \\"The Bourne Identity\\" (2002) and \\"The Bourne Supremacy\\" (2004).<br /><br />This film is loosely based on the novel \\"The Bourne Ultimatum\\" (1990) by Robert Ludlum (1927 to 2001).<br /><br />Jason Bourne (Matt Damon) finally gets all the answers he was looking for in the first two films.  In other words, all is revealed.<br /><br />This movie takes us all over the world to such places as London, Paris, Madrid, and Tangier (in Morocco).<br /><br />This is one, smart, action movie.  It's also exciting.  Action fans definitely will not be disappointed!<br /><br />There are two chase scenes in this movie that are, in a word--unforgettable.  These are a rooftop pursuit in Tangier and a New York City car chase.  Also, there is one incredible fight scene.<br /><br />Matt Damon gives a good performance as a former CIA assassin.  As well, all supporting actors (such as Julia Stiles, Joan Allen, Scott Glenn, Albert Finney) give solid performances.<br /><br />As with the two previous movies, the background music adds to each scene.<br /><br />The DVD itself (the one released Dec. 2007) has seven extras.  All of them are interesting.<br /><br />Finally, some scenes employ a \\"shaky camera\\" technique.  Personally, I found this interesting but some may find it distracting,<br /><br />In conclusion, this is an excellent movie on which to end this trilogy.  The numbers also prove this statement:  this movie cost about one hundred and ten million dollars to make and the worldwide box office amount, thus far, is about four hundred and forty-three million!!<br /><br />(2007;  1 hr, 45 min excluding end credits;  wide screen;  20 scenes)<br /><br />&lt;&lt;Stephen PLETKO, London, Ontario, Canada>><br /><br />XXXXX

B00BEPVAV8|4.0|I don't know if its me or what but i think this game is kind of hard to do..I don't seem to be able to get very far.  But thats the fun of it I guess cuz it makes me mad and I keep trying to get further on it.

B001AQR3JY|5.0|This is just a wonderful movie.  It is perfect for a fun rainy afternoon with the kids.  Excellent quality DVD.
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|at first I did not like this game because it was a bit diffucult. once you get the ropes it is an addicting game. the one thing I don't like is the price of new armors. which wouldn't be bad if the rate at which you get money was not so comparably slow.
B005LAIHZY|5.0|Wonderful movie, especially if you have a little girl with red hair!  Love having the Collector's Edition, great quality discs and extras!
B00947N6UG|5.0|A story that reinforces the idea that bad dreams/night terrors can be overcome with beliefs in the GOOD characters, the Guardians.  My 6 yr. old grandson has watched it several times, and knows when he quits believing in the Guardians, the magic goes with them.

B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I didn't think the melodrama would be so captivating, but the location, the time period, and the script &#34;grabbed&#34; me.  The story line of all three seasons shows is so well done that I find myself talking about possible future plots with my sister who introduced this program to me.  Can't wait to see how the young widow conducts herself.

B00C7JG0KG|1.0|Listen up Disney! It's time to fire those flying chimps you've got working in your public relations and marketing departments. Charging a premium for a single 3D disc and then asking for an additional $5.99 plus shipping for 2D is adding insult to injury. No 2D/3D combo pack = no sale. You lack the brains of the Scarecrow, the heart of the Tin Man, and the courage of the Cowardly Lion. We won't suffer your insolence any longer. Do not arouse the wrath of the Great and Powerful Oz! You need to give this matter a little more thought. Now go away and come back tomorrow. The Great Oz has spoken!

B004ZMWUCU|4.0|This book was heart wrenching at times with its accurate depiction of an orphanage in Ireland in the 1930's - 1996 when the last one closed. The author did a good job of incorporating facts with fiction. I really enjoyed it, as I think many others would as well.

B000IYV1ME|4.0|Blu-ray transfer quite good which is to be expected for a 2005 film. Special effects are realistic and credible.<br /><br />Aging can be a problem with some geopolitical films; this one is holding up as still reasonably contemporary eight years later. It's not for casual viewing though as there are four related major sub-plots that are advanced simultaneously from very nearly the beginning to the end. The manner in which the film switches between them, and their intellectual depth beyond the typical intelligence agent action genre, requires paying attention to prevent getting lost.<br /><br />Syriana does not tie everything up neatly at the end and in retrospect this is appropriate. It's not to set the stage for a sequel. There is sufficient finality to end the story but maintaining credibility demands it be presented as a time slice on the continuum of fossil fuel energy resources, enormous corporations, and powerful governments. The manner in which Syriana does this should provoke some relevant questions and thinking about the issues afterward.<br /><br />I found it a film well worth seeing, even eight years after its theatrical release, as it's still provocatively relevant. Strongly recommend doing so when attention to the film won't be distracted.

B00CL0J99K|4.0|Let me start by saying that I can understand why there are a lot of split opinions about IRON MAN 3.  It's a film full of misdirection and deceptions, and I was a little distressed by a couple of them - which would give away too much to detail here.  Suffice it to say that there were a couple of moments I felt somewhat cheated; and though I'll be vague about it I can say it involved Mandarin. Still, read on; while I gave the movie four stars, I believe down the road I might very well revise this to a five.  I'll explain...<br /><br />First of all, rest assured there is A LOT of action. And there are a lot of the Iron Suits, too...it's just that Tony Stark isn't often the one IN the suit.  I found myself often frustrated by that fact: Iron Man interruptus, if you will. Either the suits were off on their own, or they were on other people, or they weren't working properly...something that seemed to occur almost constantly.<br /><br />I saw it in Imax 3D, and it was well worth the extra $$ to do so (given the fact that $17 is a RIDICULOUS price for a movie ticket in the first place). The movie was lush, packed with detail, and continuously drew me \\"inside\\" it.  The scenes of (don't panic about spoilers - these are in ALL the promos) Stark's house exploding and falling into the sea are meticulously crafted and extremely inclusive...I really felt the dimensional layers as the house was blown apart: I could feel the force of the detonation, and house collapsing, and the impact of the sea as the house AND Iron Man tumbled into it. Similarly, the moments where his suit fly through the air and \\"find\\" him, or the death-defying scenes aboard (and outside) Air Force One, and so many others throughout the film really do feel like you're there.<br /><br />When it comes to the action you'd expect from a movie such as this, IRON MAN 3 is a rollicking, smash-mouth treat. Director Shane Black - whose only previous directorial role was on [[ASIN:B002QYSZBO Kiss Kiss Bang Bang]] (which ironically served as Robert Downey, Jr.'s comeback film) - does a more-than-capable job, and the characters and events are big and loud. You'll feel like you are on a roller-coaster; while there are of course moments of crazy adrenaline rushes, there are also emotional ups and down.  But Tony Stark is just as glib as always, causing almost as much damage with his mouth as he does as with his armor.  I laughed a lot during the movie ... for those who care, Tony's mechanical manservant JARVIS (the voice of Paul Bettany) gets a good deal of air play here, and he's just as lovably bumbling as always.<br /><br />Yet - and remember my dichotomy about this - the movie really focuses on Tony Stark OUTSIDE the suit. I wish the promos had clued me into this: our man Tony is experiencing Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder because of what happened in [[ASIN:B008NCSZQ8 The Avengers]]. Had I been informed of that I wouldn't have felt slighted, and I think it would have better prepared me for this movie. I found myself constantly disappointed, even cheated, by the absence of Tony WITHIN the suit. I realize now that was the only way I felt Iron man was indeed Iron Man. Yet I will declare that now, looking back, I feel good about the movie, and I'm glad to have seen Tony as a more \\"real\\" person, as a more human man, a man undergoing a metamorphosis.<br /><br />There are other things about this movie that surprised me - and I'm sure will surprise you - that I will NOT tell you. Just realize that while this is a very action-packed movie, it is also a personal one. It's this kind of writing that has typified the action movies of today, making them stand out above their \\"super-hero\\" predecessors. Like the [[ASIN:B001OGWY1W The Dark Knight]] movies of Chris Nolan, these new, and better, powerhouse films are focusing on their heroes' moments of personal growth, warts and all. It's a trend I'm really happy to see.<br /><br />(A NOTE: if you feel negatively about my review, please leave a comment to help me next time.)nt to help me next time.)
B000SLP4SE|4.0|Plausible thriller with Wahlberg easy to root for protagonist. Good pacing keeps interest and Danny Glover is a good heavy.
B0018O4YSQ|5.0|(NOTE for anyone who wants to give a negative review: please leave a comment to help me do better next time.)<br /><br />POINT 1: This is one TERRIFIC movie!<br />POINT 2: It's not for everyone.<br /><br />One of my top ten movies of all time, this movie is breath-taking from beginning to end. If you're a repeat viewer - and there are many - you might prefer to keep the sound off until Kiefer Sutherland first looks at his watch (it's a tradition among many purists who believe the opening narration gives away too much). But if you're a newcomer, you'll need the opening narration and everything else the movie provides you because, to paraphrase Bette Davis in ALL ABOUT EVE, \\"it's going to be a bumpy ride.\\"<br /><br />DARK CITY is a thrilling head trip from start to finish, a tale that gives you just enough to stand upon and then every so often yanks the rug right out from under you.  But the disorientation is purposeful: director Proyas said that he wanted his viewers to experience the same level of bewilderment that his characters were feeling.<br /><br />We start with a naked man (Rufus Sewell) waking up in a bathtub, the telephone ringing, and when he answers it he's told to leave IMMEDIATELY or THEY will find him there. He has no memory of anything before the phone call, but before he can rush out he finds the body of a woman who has been viciously murdered in one of the rooms. He makes it out just in time for us to see that those who are coming for him virtually float on air. They wear black floor-length leather jackets, and they are known as the Strangers.  THAT at least makes sense, but it's what they can DO, and how it affects the citizens of Dark City, that makes all the difference. It isn't long before we find out the man in the tub is John Murdoch, and HE finds out that not only the strangers want to know what he's doing, but so does a woman who says she's his wife (Jennifer Connelly). And a detective hot on his trail (William Hurt). Oh...and the mouth-breather over the phone, too (Kiefer Sutherland).<br /><br />It's told in a dark noir-ish style, with a nod to the old, clunky cars, clothes, and styles of yesteryear, and the sets seem almost to breathe an atmosphere of tense, claustrophobic fear. And that's not close to the strangest part: at midnight, every night, when the clocks strike the hour, the city grinds to a halt...cars stop, people fall asleep, and the Strangers get busy: dressing citizens in new clothes, placing them in new homes with new memories, and then...the buildings change. Yes, CHANGE. They shrink or grow out of the ground like hungry worms, twisting, widening, thinning, closing off alleys and making no streets. And when the citizens wake they do so without realizing they were out of commission, and life continues on as normal...with new family members, new homes, new jobs...<br /><br />Yes, it's trippy, and a little crazy...but if you have seen and liked [[ASIN:B000HAB4KS The Matrix]], or anything by Jean-Pierre Jeunet ([[ASIN:B004SEUIXS Amelie]], [[ASIN:B000MQ787U The City Of Lost Children]]), or [[ASIN:B001HM1PFO The Rocky Horror Picture Show]], this could be right down your alley. In fact, Richard O'Brien's portrayal of Riff Raff in ROCKY HORROR was the role Proyas credited for inspiring the Strangers.<br /><br />Alex Proyas is an extremely selective director, and in a quarter century of film making he's only made five feature films other than this one.  Three of them bear mentioning: [[ASIN:B005ZC0SYQ The Crow]], [[ASIN:B000I9VZKW I, Robot]] and [[ASIN:B002GGCKYA Knowing]].  While each film at first seems to be quite different from one another (and DARK WORLD), they all display worlds at a crossing.  Within every film there is a moment in which society faces a monumental coming to terms with a supremely metamorphic moment. But at the heart of each movie the metamorphosis occurs because one person stood his ground. And it is that which lies at the heart of this movie - a man who must come to terms with a microverse that makes no sense, where none of the rules apply, and it is only when he understands that - that the rulebook must be thrown out the window - that he begins to effect change.<br /><br />And that, in a nutshell, gives us our insight into this bizarre and wonderful movie...one that the recently late Roger Ebert called the best film of 1998. It was the year before THE MATRIX came out (and if you look hard, you can see the same rooftop scenery - when DARK CITY wrapped, their producers sold its set to the Wachowskis' production company). Certainly, fans of both movies might agree, it's not the only debt THE MATRIX paid to DARK CITY.rms with a microverse that makes no sense, where none of the rules apply, and it is only when he understands that - that the rulebook must be thrown out the window - that he begins to effect change.<br /><br />And that, in a nutshell, gives us our insight into this bizarre and wonderful movie...one that the recently late Roger Ebert called the best film of 1998.

B00B1E6FF8|2.0|I found the movie less than believable in many respects. The use of vulgarity was far too distracting for me (some is okay but do all agencies teach their people to curse and swear continuously?). The scenes at the compound were blacked out too much but could have been filmed as though being seen through night goggles. All in all, I found the movie poor at best--I am stretching to give it two stars.
B000OLGCI4|5.0|Didn't have any scratches on the disc and the cover looked brand new. My daughter has loved this movie since she was 6 months old and i was devastated when I lost my first copy, but after I received this one it was as if I never lost my original.
B004UHL9EK|5.0|I've tried at least 3 other timers and this was the only one that allowed me to set it up so that I could open it and choose from several different timer settings that I previously set.

Also shifts back to your previous activity - surfing, gaming, reading, whatever, very easily. Lets you choose your sound. Snooze button with selectable time. There's really nothing else I could ask from a timer. Highly recommended.

0439023483|5.0|The first -- and by far the best -- of the trilogy.<br /><br />Katniss Everdeen, the heroine, is nothing like the soft, spoiled, boy-crazy teenaged girls who infest the pages of YA; she's a tough, fierce, prematurely grown-up young woman from a hardscrabble West Virginia-like province in what remains of a future United States. Her voice is solid and grounded, believable for who and what she is and refreshingly light on navel-gazing. When she turns introspective, she's usually earned it. The three main men in her world (Gale, her best friend; Peeta, her partner in the Game; and Haymitch, her reprobate coach) are also well-realized, strong characters in their own right.<br /><br />Collins has built a world that, while different from our own, feels authentic and requires only a moderate suspension of disbelief. The Game itself is oddly familiar in this age of reality TV and only a few degrees away from MMA and the other bloodsports we watch today. The characters are engaged by this setting but not overwhelmed by it, as sometimes happens in future-worlds stories.<br /><br />The Hunger Games isn't perfect -- it has a few slow spots, thankfully brief, and Collins is better at descibing one-on-one or two-on-one combat than the two or three large-scale melees that ought to be swirls of kinetic energy (a handicap that especially hurts Mockingjay, the last in the series). Much can be forgiven in the sheer speed of the telling, and in Katniss' often engaging company.<br /><br />Male readers: don't worry that the main character is a girl, because she's a kick-ass girl (no pink cover here). Adults: don't worry that the characters are mostly teenagers. If you're looking for an adventure, there's one right here.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|So happy to be able to watch Downton Abbey Season 3 on Amazon.<br />I highly recommend it and am looking forward to Season 4.
0439023513|3.0|A severe disappointment after Hunger Games and Catching Fire, and for a very clear reason: Katniss, the teenaged warrior-heroine of the trilogy, isn't allowed to be herself.<br /><br />In addition to being the point-of-view character for this series, Katniss is also its living, beating heart. As long as she's out fighting, rebelling, worrying, wondering, we're right there with her, feeling her pain, celebrating her triumphs, holding our breath as she's about to fall off yet another cliff. Indeed, the series' weakest points come when Katniss is still. In Mockingjay, she's not merely still, she's passive much of the time, not allowed to go out and fight her own fight.<br /><br />Mockingjay has problems other than a smothered heroine. Collins doesn't handle large-scale action effectively; her hand-to-hand combat scenes in the previous books crackled, but anything above squad-level engagement falls flat. A major character just fades away, even though he deserves a much better sendoff. A character close to Katniss -- one who helped start the whole mess -- dies not only offstage but in an almost offhand way.<br /><br />If you read the first two books and just can't stand to not know how it all works out, go ahead and read this. If you want to see what all the fuss is about, go directly to Hunger Games, do not pass \\"Go\\".
B0094LTWDM|5.0|Loved it more than I was expecting.  Meryl is always one of the best and this was just another of her best.
B007AJFSJW|5.0|In our times everyone needs a good grab of basic economics concepts. Given the complexity of the economic questions that affect our lives, it makes a lot of sense to try to educate oneself in such questions. However, most of the books on the subject available to the layman do not care for explaining the underlying economics before defending its preferred agenda.<br /><br />This book is different. Mr. krugman starts by a very clear and  overview of recession and depression economics. For the first time I really understood what is a &#34;liquidity trap&#34;, how this can happen, and which policies can be used to counter it.<br /><br />All in all, the book does an excelent job in educating it's readers in basic economis., and presenting a proposal for getting the world out of this lengthy recession.<br /><br />An impressive book and a good read.

B000JMKTLO|5.0|Flynn as a knack for writing suspense and taking the reader on a ride of twists and turns so unexpected and at times shocking that it makes for some sleepless nights! I read a great deal and a true test of how compelling a book is to me is how obsessively I read to the exclusion of all other things- let's just say there was a fair amount of housework and errands to run by the time I was finished this one. This author can show you the characters that sound like people you know, and unveil the ugly and beautiful that lurks underneath. I have read other Flynn books and they are of the same caliber. Haunting, fast-paced and just plain awesome!
B00BESFWBY|5.0|I don't think I have seen a bad movie with Gerard Butler but I must say this is one of his best. Good story with a sad ending. I'm hard to please but this one is worth it. If you are into surfing the visual is also great.

B0055OG2BC|1.0|Now going into this, I knew the movie had an episodic plot, had multiple famous people acting as James Bond, had five directors, was a comedy and was short of unfinished then reworked to be a complete film. That should have detered me from viewing it, to bad I didn't listen.<br /><br />This movie is a mess. Sure some scenes are funny, but it's very stupid at the same time. I usually call Will Ferrel humor stupid but I laugh almost as much as I go &#34;Come on that's....&#34;, here the laughter to come on ratio is like 1 to 10. The plot to this movie just randomly happens thanks to trying to work at least three different scripts into one movie, and it doesn't even seem to try and give an overall story except for total caous.<br /><br />Every male James Bond portayal seems stupid, Woody Allen is a blumbering idiot (yes that's what his character is supposed to be but, I can't stand it in this case), Peter Sellers preformence really made me not like him when he's actually brillent and David Nieven just was a complete jerk. He makes Berry Nelson look like a gentalmen as Nieven's attitude is &#34;I'm more concerned with what I want, woman and beautiful flowers not the country I served and continue to serve for x years. Screw you all.&#34;<br /><br />Now the girls Vasper, Moneypenny and Nieven's daughter I liked but, most of their purpose is to be in hot outfits, seduce everyone they met, talk to Nieven and for Vasper to (SPOILER ALERT SO SKIP THIS NEXT BIT) kill Peter Sellers, thank you.<br /><br />Also it was extremely hard to view this movie, I checked the clock every five minutes for the first hour, and then every two and half for the next.<br /><br />Honestly, this movie for ME sucked. Good thing Austin Powers came along and made this properly.
B004NJW976|5.0|This 4-disc `deluxe' collection of Moby's 2011 release `Destroyed' is in essence a 2-CD album plus a DVD, and a bonus CD recording of a live-on-stage concert in London featuring some of Moby's classic numbers from his earlier work.<br /><br />The 2 studio-recorded CDs offer a mellow collection of music from Moby, more in the overall style of 2009's `Wait for Me' than `Hotel' or `Last Night' though with some upbeat numbers. The music is complex, and develops course by course rather than serving you the whole meal in one go. You could almost describe the style as `progressive' in that several numbers evolve from sparse beginnings to increasing multi-layered complexity and in most cases take the listener on an emotional roller-coaster to a satisfying climax.<br /><br />Disc 2 continues in the style of disc 1, with 8 new tracks plus variants on 3 of the disc 1 tracks: `the broken places', `lie down in darkness' and `the day', the theme of which is the day Moby lost his mother to cancer.<br /><br />The DVD includes videos, live-on-stage material, interviews and some odds & sods. There appears to be no `play all' option, so you have to watch the clips one-at-a-time then return to the main menu to make your next selection.<br /><br />The bonus disc sold only with the `deluxe' edition is a live-on-stage concert recorded in London in June 2011. This is Moby at his most energetic onstage with mojo in high gear. Danceable renditions of 14 numbers including `in my heart', `we are all made of stars' `porcelain' and `lift me up' actually better the originally released studio versions.<br /><br />The presentation is fine but understated. In a strong hinged box oozing quality, the 4 discs nest in robust numbered sleeves, and a glossy 12-page booklet full or artistic photo-images completes the package. The whole effect is very tasteful, even highbrow.<br /><br />So, with the deluxe edition of `Destroyed' you get a lot of very fine music for your money.

B0054N73EY|5.0|I wanted to hate this album, I really did.<br /><br />To me, for a band who's been at it for over 20 years, they straight killed it.<br /><br />Here's why... A majority of bands lose an \\"edge\\" after a certain point. Most after their third or fourth album.  Not the Chili Peppers.  These guys are pushing 50, and are able to maintain an innovative style in their song writing album after album.  One of the few bands who have actual \\"eras\\" to their music.<br /><br />Is this the same Chili Peppers of the last decade? NO!... but that's a good thing! I think this is the secret to their success... They keep themselves evolving instead of trying to stay with a certain sound.  On \\" I'm with you\\" The chili peppers make musical diversions not heard on any other album, and they do so in a very tasteful style.<br /><br />Like I said, I really wanted to hate this and came at it with skeptical ears. But I cannot NOT like this album.... Do yourself a favor and listen to this (especially if you worship Frusciante). It really is an awesome piece of work.

B009I2UH2W|2.0|**Update after 5 months of light use this product separated from main plug and will no longer charge, I decided to buy a skiva plug which seems to be doing better and not giving me the same issues***<br /><br />This is a great power cord. It is durable and I love the little light indicator on the main plug showing that it has power. The reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5? Well I don't like how tightly wound the cord is. I find myself unplugging it to talk on the phone because otherwise i'm really fighting with it to stretch it to my ear. The second thing I don't like is how small the actual plug is. Maybe it's because my chevy malibu has the adapter charger in the WORST place. If I plug this powercord in to my chevy I almost pull apart the molding of my center console to unplug this. They plug part is so sleek and small that I can't get a good grip on it to pull it out and as a result everything gets tugged on. Maybe it's just the location of the adapter charger in MY car but this drives me nuts. I now plug it into the backseat adapter because there is ample room to get a good grip and unplug it.

B00B4VI8MQ|5.0|Time flies doing this game.  Not too much brain power either.  Of course I don't get much done other than play.  Its addictive
B006MW3UZW|4.0|While we very much enjoyed the first season, and give it five stars, the second (so far, anyway) is a little heavy on WWi in the first 3 episodes.  That's as far as we've gotten at this point.
B00AQNOCZ0|5.0|If you need the entire Harry Potter collection, this set is worth the money. Every movie, plus bonus features, for roughly $50.00.  Buying each movie separately (and getting special features) is probably going to cost close to $100.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|This virtual keyboard is very intuitive. It only gets better with using. It doesn't like curse words, but after a while it will learn even non standard expression such a &#34;grrr&#34; if used often. Using SwiftKey many time takes just thumb of one hand. I love it.
B009VIZDLI|5.0|I had so many giggles and  fun reading this.....aren't we all just a little different, so therefore we can all find a connection with the characters, and have a chuckle at ourselves.
B00A81NFAS|4.0|Meet Pat.  His mother has just bailed him out of a psychiatric hospital, against the doctor's advice.  Pat has been institutionalized because he caught his wife, Nikki, with another man.  And then proceded to beat that man near to death.  Once out, Pat's friend's wife Veronica tries to set him up with Tiffany, an equally-troubled widow who uses dance to cope with her demons.  Figuring he could be charitable, while at the same time convince Nikki to drop the restraining order, Pat decides to help Tiffany with her dance competition, all the while trying to satisfy his father's belief that Pat is the key to a Philadelphia Eagles victory of the Cowboys.<br /><br />When you get right down to it, SILVER LININGS PLAYBOOK is a romantic comedy.  It's not laugh-out-loud funny, and it's not even that romantic, yet that's exactly what the film is.  It's a bit predictable, too, despite writer/director David O. Russell's best efforts.  His previous film, THE FIGHTER, was also a genre piece that more or less stuck to conventions; that film was a superior outing, perhaps due to its grittier subject matter.  PLAYBOOK does try to dig beneath the skin; this is most visible in the scenes between leads Bradley Cooper (who would have won the Oscar if Daniel Day-Lewis hadn't been nominated), and Jennifer Lawrence (who did win the Oscar, even if she deserved it more two years ago for A WINTER'S BONE).  The actors are game for the material; the script starts out strong, bogs down in the middle, then picks up again for a beautifully unconventional dance number (I couldn't take my eyes away from the screen), and throughout the film, these two actors give it their all.  Anyone who only knows Cooper from THE HANGOVER should take note, and anyone who identifies Jennifer Lawrence solely with THE HUNGER GAMES should pull themselves out of puberty for a minute.  (Okay, that's unfair.  The book was actually pretty grown up.)<br /><br />Cooper and Lawrence aren't the only two here, however.  Jacki Weaver, as Pat's mom, is a subtle wonder (and was nominated for Best Supporting Actress, for what it's worth); she doesn't do much, but what she does is terrific.  Julia Stiles is great in her limited role, as is (surprisingly) Chris Tucker.  Shea Wigham continues to get work as Pat's brother; one of these days, he'll be a leading man in his own right, but for now it's nice to see him wherever he pops up.  The true wonder among the supporting cast, however, is Robert De Niro, nominated for Best Supporting Actor.  De Niro isn't as good as he was in his heyday, but this is the best he's been in a long time, and his character is one of the more interesting ones in the film.  His relationship with Pat isn't explored as thoroughly as it should've been, and that is one of the film's many flaws.  SILVER LININGS PLAYBOOK aims high; as such, when it falls flat, one can't help but notice.  But what's here is worth watching, if only for the caliber of performances features.  It may not be a whole lot more than an actor's piece...but hey, there are worse things in the world.

B00B2G2RG6|2.0|Just another network flop. I thought it would be another Hannibal-type chiller but it just seemed to lose itself in Edgar Allen Poe instead. Became slow, somewhat overstaged as do many network TV series. Couldn't get past 4 or 5 episodes. Sorry.
B00AESN8XY|5.0|Creating a plague to wipe out humanity takes a lot more thought and strategy than one would think. Highly addictive game, you will be sucked in and mesmerized for hours.

B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is a fun game that you will go nonstop. I would recommend this game to any one. There's a bunch of fun challenges you will do
B00992CF6W|5.0|Ok guys. This bug is on mine too. The one where you can't host multiplayer. Works fine if you join other devices. You just can't host on the Kindle. Otherwise I love this game and I know the new update is coming out with online multiplayer so hang on guys!  :)
B0019TSI8W|5.0|I know there is a gorgeous woman inside each of us.<br />This movie helped me to love me and start to do something to make me fall in love with me again, because it is not enough to love what you do for a living and to love the people around you, we have to start with us first then it transcends.
0307266303|5.0|Highly recommended for anyone who likes to run. I guess non-runners can enjoy it as well because it provides lots of good info about the tribe and great narration of interviews with runners, coaches and professors.
B000OJFV4C|4.0|I would suggest to have a glass of wine on one hand and some chocolate on the other to indulge yourself while watching this series.
B00881PTRC|4.0|The little animated guy is amusing, and there are plenty of word catagory's to choose from.  A nice pastime  Sometimes you need to tap on a letter more than once if you are on a Kindle.  Not a biggy.
B008HK3XKO|5.0|Case is not only good looking but it is very functional. The screen savers were also a nice touch for my kindle.
B001QFZADA|5.0|Love this book. It was an easy read and made a lot of since. I also bought the 5 love languages for children, book.
B00AHSIQWE|3.0|My 14 yr old daughter and I really enjoyed the first two in this series and were looking forward to this one.  About halfway through it pushed my &#34;suspension of disbelief&#34; too far and I was no longer involved in the movie.  I checked in with my daughter and it was the same thing -- to far, to ridiculous, unbelievable characters and events (even for Batman!).  So, watch this to complete the series but I certainly didn't get as much out of it as the first two.
B00BWBHIUG|4.0|Colorful &amp; can build differently each play! Mix those plants, coral, and ornamentals &amp; get new fishes! Fun for various ages &amp; skill levels.
B0041KKYBA|5.0|it shows exactly what happened to create this disaster of an economy that we're living in.  this government needs to stop going into wars to profit the arms dealers and go after the bankers with the same zeal.  that's the solution.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This is even better than the first book!!!!!!! I love this book so much it is amazing! Can't wait to read 3
B000H0MKOC|5.0|i wish everyone could see this movie.  i've tried to show it to all my friends who smoke.  the topic is so scandalous.  nobody who smokes wants to talk about it.
B008RA3X5E|1.0|The volume does not work so it was a waste of my money...if it worked I would have loved it.  I have a Kindle HD 8.9.
B0087JTAKW|4.0|Another good one from Mitch Albom! A lovely tale of life and time.It makes your realize that you need to treasure each day.
B008NW67E0|3.0|Their last cd was much better.  Only care for two songs.  But if you are a through and through Mumford fan, it may be for you.
1594204217|5.0|I first fell in love with Michael Pollan when I saw him review his book Botany of Desire more than a decade ago--and I have enjoyed every one of his books since.  In Cooked,  Pollan reflects on the lost art of cooking, which is being replaced by commercially processed foods that cater to busy lifestyles at the expense of nutrition, flavor, socialization, and the shared traditions of cooking  that are passed down from generation to generation. Calling on the elements of fire, air, water, and earth, Pollan researches the best aspects of barbecue, simmering pots, baked bread--and makes a case for bringing cooking back into the home. This is an important book, which celebrates an endeavor too important to lose.
B001RXB4FY|5.0|this cd is for my son and he loves it. I didnt know who they were until he told me about them. they are a good band like their music.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I honestly can say this game is awesome and it takes a lot to impress me Cuz I am a hard core gamer but this game is fun for all ages and its easy and keeps me and it will keep kids occupied for a while on and not to mention it free so get it to see and take it from me THIS GAME IS AWESOME
B003OF3R0S|5.0|this was for my son, he loves them. good music. He plays it all the time. I would recommend this product
B002VUFKG6|2.0|I can not recommend this book... it is only about problems with marriage. The author must be really disgusted of marriage.
1476712042|3.0|I couldn't put the book down. This does not mean it was the greatest written piece of romantic fiction I had read, rather I didn't mind so much because I cared about the characters. Each one was well written, and their personalities were realistic as well as the interaction between them. A very important quality when the book is moved forward by dialogue and not just the narrator.<br /><br />It was crammed full of drama and events, none of which seemed linked to one another. Perhaps the author put endless amount of effort into this one project. It could have been strategically split into two or more. I would have been hooked on the series, and would have gladly read more of the delicious details of the steamy romantic scenes.<br /><br />The relationship between the lead and her man was hot, desperate, and dysfunctionally beautiful. It was nice that there was some substance in this young adult romance, and not just an \\"I-love-you-for-some-unexplainable-but-toxic-reason-even-though-you're-not-special\\" storyline. I truly, deeply felt for them, knowing that their relationship had value even as messed up as it seemed at times. Disfunctional? Yes, but that's what dramas are all about anyway, right? I would recommend it to friends, but would also defend myself in saying, \\"guilty pleasure.\\"
B0070DOHQS|5.0|I have tried so many desktop control software programs and been let down time and agian.This one did not let me down works right the first time and every time. windows 8 to android 2.2 smooth as silk. and quick start up times.I could not want more.
B000GYI32M|5.0|This was a pretty good season of the OC. I have to say they handled Marissa's death really well in this show. They did a good job with pulling everything together with them all graduating from high school and planning their futures. It was a really fun season to watch.
B000VBJEEG|5.0|This is one of my fav disney movies of all time! Def enjoyed it And highly recommend for kids and adults alike!
B0009K7QZ8|4.0|Once again another good season of the OC. This season was pretty good from beginning to end, I still loved the drama and especially the music within the show.
0060536276|5.0|My daughter and I love this audio book, ever since she was a child. It's a hoot! And Ronald Dahl is the best! Beats the movie by far.
B009NQKPUW|4.0|I was actually pretty surprised how much I enjoyed this movie. I have never seen the Alien movies, and I am terrible with scary movies (I am way to squeamish). But I really did enjoy this movie. It had really good effects, the actors were good at being both creepy and freaked out by the events that were happening, and overall I would have to say that I really did enjoy this movie. I hope they make another one in the series, or remake the old ones, because I may actually watch them now. I have to say the best scene was in the automated surgery machine thing where she had it cut the alien out of her, seriously disturbing but very great scene for the movie.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Lose track of time so easily! Love it!Like the seletion of characters...would like to see more boards with special enhancements! Play it at least 3times a day for hour or so!
B007X15GRQ|4.0|This was another good Mark Wahlberg movie, and I loved Kate Beckinsale in it. The action was good, the story was good, overall a solid movie.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|I like all of the hidden object games.This one is tricky to play but I like that too so download this game
B003JTHXOK|4.0|I always enjoyed Nicolas Sparks books because they are easy and quick reads, and they typically have pretty good endings. He's really good at writing romances that evoke emotion in the reader. That being sad, I really enjoyed this book from beginning to almost the end. The ending of the book just didn't feel right to me, it didn't seem like the right ending and it left me with a feeling of dissatisfaction with the entire book, which really bummed me out since I liked the book up until that point.
B0017I1IZA|5.0|When I grow up I want to be Stephanie Plum!  Tastycakes and Ranger for desert, o boy what a life!
B004X75RK4|4.0|I actually liked this movie more the second time around than the first. I like Sandra Bullock and Ryan Renolds together. I also loved Betty White in the movie, but she is always funny in all of her movies, so that wasn't a big surprised. The whole deported to Canada storyline was pretty amusing, and the investigator is equally amusing throughout the movie.
B009AMANBA|4.0|Had to format DVD but when we did we enjoyed the movie better.  If you are a history buff, then you will like this movie.
1582701709|5.0|I read this book a few years ago and like most of the bad ratings I've read here, I decided it was all bunk.  Nothing like happiness can be that easy, right?  Wrong!  I feel sorry for the bad reviewers today.  It's so much easier to be miserable and find fault with everything than it would be to take personal responsibility for positive change, because of course, nothing negative in our lives is our fault, right?  We are so conditioned to blame everything and everybody else for our own misery, it has become common place in human nature to blame blame blame.  Go ahead and criticize and blame, make fun of and devalue your own ability to make your life better.  Take a pill to keep from taking the pill of responsibility for your own existence and the happiness to be achieved in living.  Blame your DNA, your parents, your job, your kids, your husband, your brain chemistry, your health.  Keep blaming and if that works for you then live that way, but don't bitch to anyone else that life just threw you a bad hand.  That's pathetic.  Misery loves company especially when it's your own company.<br /><br />I reread this book with an open mind and basically all it teaches is to take some freekin responsibility for your own life, your own happiness and quit thinking it's going to come from anyone else or anything but you.  For those who are skeptics, it affirms they will always be negative, no matter what.  Sad!
B005LAIIHG|4.0|Haven't watched this yet, but talking to several who have, none of them liked this movie.  I bought it because of the Academy Awards nominations it received.  Will watch it anyway and form my own opinion.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|i like it 20000000000000) timez better than 1 if it cost money still get it soooooooooooooo GET IT yeaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa. hi hi hi i think u should get im awsome at it hard thought get it
B00BT0ZS52|4.0|I couldn't find anyone to go see this in the theater and just had to watch it alone at home. My dear-heart was interested, right up till I told her the name of the movie! I really don't know how this epic deserved such a bad rap. It was convoluted but actually hung together very well. I am a serious sci-fi fan though. Anyone who went to this to see their favorite actor may have been either thrilled or walked out early.<br />Spoiler... Soylent Green is People!<br />An excellent addition to my sci-fi video library.
B004UID2LC|2.0|This app was okay when I first downloaded it but now its not that good. it has all the pictures on different videos and runs the battery down.
0062082353|5.0|it was very good and very believable. Raw and reallistic. enjoyed it very much. Sorry to see him murdered like he was. A great warrior killed by a coward.....
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|this App is so fun. and good gtaphics too! very realistic! I love it! so what are you waiting for?! GET IT!<br />:-D
B0050DIWFC|3.0|It sucked me right in at first and I was excited. But then the story kind of slowed down.. I found the characters a little unbelievable and not consistent. Great twist at towards the end. But worst of all - this book has one of those 'not an ending' endings.. left me with questions, ya know.. I hate that! I like everything wrapped up all nice neat at the end. If I wanted to make up my own ending, I'd be writing my own book.
B002NT3B52|3.0|If you want to learn more about your dog and it's behavior patterns, give this book a go. Interesting so far (I'm only half way through) and as eager as I am to get to the end, it's a tough read. The author is a dog behavioral scientist and it's almost as if she's written this work for a scientific journal, for fellow scientists, using big, laborious scientific words - hence the 3 star rating. I skip the silly words and am still able to get the gist of her communication using layman's terminology. I say give it a good shot. It's interesting what you can learn about your furry loved one.
B00CL68QVQ|3.0|This was a loud movie....alot of yelling and fighting.  I was really surprised that it caused such a stir.  It was okay.  The actors were awesome though.
B000WCDI64|5.0|Great video!  Amy is in her own element and at her finest.  She has a great back-up band and this video shows that she sounded awesome when she sang live.
B00CL68NOG|5.0|This is a good movie.  I enjoyed the mother son relationship.  It was such a real story, well at least to me.
B000VBJEEG|5.0|This was fun, very cute and funny. It was appropriate for all ages which was another positive feature. I would recommend it.
B00C1BU7V8|3.0|This movie bored me from the beginning, in fact, I couldn't even watch the entire movie.  The actors were amazing, but that was it.
B00000K3D4|5.0|This is fun for children of all ages. I enjoyed it and was glad to add it to my library of DVD's.
B00APUQRPC|5.0|All movies that Clint makes are amazing.  He can't pick a bad one.  I enjoyed the story and I LOVE baseball.
B0042U94UQ|5.0|I like animated films very much. This one will be popular with my students and me. I appreciate the humor.
1455502758|1.0|I'm sure he's changed his opinion by now.  Hitchens continues the legacy of Juwish radicals that want to continue the talmudic assualt on the Christian faith under the guise of disinterested agnostic.  But, c'mon.  We know from his last interviews he's another cryptic juwe.  Knowing he's a cryptic sort of  blows the integrity of his criticisms out the window.
B001HN6922|5.0|This was a fun piece of animation and story. It gives the small underdog another little boost. I will enjoy sharing it with my students on a Friday afternoon.
B001ANSSDC|4.0|I knew almost nothing about this book, other than all the Oscar buzz for the movie, which I have yet to see. I picked it up because I just got a Kindle and wanted to read a book on it, this was cheap so I grabbed it.<br /><br />What a great surprise! I loved it. I don't know if it has been said before, but I took it like The Perks of Being a Wallflower for adults. I loved how rich all the characters were and the optimism of Pat. Now knowing who Jennifer Lawrence plays I can see why she got all the Oscar buzz again, very different from who she really is and a great character to portray. I'd really recommend it to anyone who likes stories with a little mystery and portrayals of real life.
B000F8O35U|5.0|I enjoy animated films. The story is a classic, and this one has great songs to sing along with boot. I will share it with my students, after they read the book.
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|it not that bad of a game iron man armors are pretty awsome it is a game that I would tell my friends to download on to any device be aneroid kindle ect
1476734941|5.0|I am usually skeptical about topics like this, but since Michael M. went to such lengths to show what it was all about in the DVD, I became more interested.
B000VYX8PE|5.0|It was a very exciting book. It was also very sad.<br />If u are younger than 10 don't read these book.
B000E8N690|5.0|We both enjoyed the music and the story. Acting was excellent. It does deal with some of the darker sides of being a music legend, but the outcome was good.
B002BU0DPE|5.0|Love this headset. Second one I've owned...it was broken during moving. Live the sound and use it primarily for FPS games....gives you the advantage.you hear footsteps that much louder and cab tell if they're coming from the left or right. A must buy for serious gamers.
B00003CWNR|5.0|Some may not like the movie's stand of abortion, but I liked it as a historical piece and a good story. Acting was excellent.
B004DLPXAO|4.0|I like the kindle and the prices here on Amazon. I liked the way you use to be able to highlighted a word and it would give you a brief meaning or click on link to give you full dictionary, they took that away in the latest update.  I also liked the two page view or one page view option., again they took that away. On my galaxy s3 phone 1 page was great and on my galaxy 10\\" tablet the two page view was perfect. I would like to see those to option back.<br />Overall one of the easiest way to one-click and buy to read I have found. It is easy to search for a book. Archiving is very easy also, but deleting can be difficult to accomplish.<br />Overall I give them a 4 star.
B007ZI06FE|5.0|I bought this book as a Kindle Daily Deal and I have to say this is one of the better daily deals I have purchased. I am really looking forward to book 2. I really like her spin on vampires and the whole, paranormal scene.
B009GIPDQS|4.0|The first question that comes into our mind after reading through the initial part of this book is about the title. Who is the racketeer? Is it the main protagonist, Malcolm? He is languishing in a jail, hating every moment of it, because he was involved in racketeering. The truth be told, he was caught unawares in the middle of a racketeering scheme. But now, he is looking forward to walk free by helping with the Feds solve the murder of a judge. So is the book about a wrongly convicted man yearning and working towards freedom? Yes, it is.<br /><br />Because of the way John Grisham narrates the story, we also tend to suspect there is more to the story than freedom. Possibly, there is an angle of redemption in it. If there is how? This thought grips the reader after he/she has taken up this book. This is also what makes this book a compelling read. You may be already familiar with the genre which has made John Grisham famous. This book doesn't belong to the genre that made John Grisham famous. It actually starts where most of his books end. That is to say after dispensing justice.<br /><br />Although John Grisham tries to provide a social commentary on justice system, ambition of the officials, greed of men and the prison system, the emphasis is on telling a simple story. Hence the social commentary is mostly hollow but helps to build drama and also makes a naive reader to choose sides. It was exactly what I was looking forward when I picked up the book. I didn't want a lot of twists and turns. A straightforward narration was good for me. At the same time, I also wanted to be surprised once in a while. That is exactly what I got.<br /><br />This is a good diversion from anything that has been eating your mind.

B00CHDKGKW|1.0|Relationship of Command is one of my favorite albums ever made, and for years I've wanted to have it on vinyl. Unfortunately with the original 2000 pressing being so hard to find (and prohibitively expensive), I never had the chance. Then, on Record Store Day 2013 the music gods saw fit to hand down unto us 4000 copies in a two disc, orange vinyl reissue. For the weeks leading up to it, I was so thrilled I would finally have this on vinyl. Then, my heart sunk when I got to the record store and immediately saw one guy buying the only three copies that store was able to get. I'm quite positive he turned them around and sold them through online marketplaces (Amazon) at double the purchase price, if not more. To the person price gouging this particular copy, please realize that no one, not one person, will pay your highly immoral asking price. In a few weeks, maybe a month or so, you and the rest of your bloodsucking RSD scalpers will be scrambling to just recoup your original losses. So, I hope you are pleased with yourself. Not only are you keeping this out of the hands of fans for as long as it takes for you to sell it at its original price, you will actually end up losing money in the process. For anyone interested, DO NOT buy this record for anything near this price. Give it time, it will go down. Also, for those of you selling this who are actual record stores, I will be reporting you to the good people behind RSD and you will be banned from all future events and releases, like so many of your greedy cohorts have already seen happen. Hope it was worth it.

B00CL0J99K|1.0|Don't waste your money on this garbage.Generic , unimaginative plot about typical terrorists crap. They ruined Iron Man's nemesis The Mandarin. They say its a racist stereotype to make The Mandarin Chinese. What the hell, Mandarin was a part of China.If they would have treated the Joker like this , Batman fans would have freaked. What I found offensive was the Middle Eastern stereotypes. The humor was generic and overwhelming, and the special effects were long boring. I had to struggle to sit through this garbage in the theater .
0307951529|3.0|As a serious marketer I found this book not all that helpful. Perhaps it's because the title dosen't match the content. The first several chapter try to inspire and motivate you but have nothing to do with a $100 Start Up.<br />Maybe it's not that great because I have read quite a few books on this subject and The $100 Startup dosen't really shine above the rest.<br />It's not a bad book, it just not a great book. If you're new to this sort of thing then you may find it useful.<br />There are some very useful pages that help you sort out what actionable steps you can make such as getting ready for a product launch.<br /><br />Read it, get what you can out of it and see if it helps you.<br /><br />MM
B00992CF6W|3.0|WTF. You have to pay seven dollars for THIS?!? It sucks unless your in multiplayer, let me say that right now. The minimal worlds you get board of quite easily, there arent any spiders or skeletons, and YOU CAN'T ACCESS CHESTS, CRAFTING TABLES, OR STONE CUTTERS, WHICH IS HOW YOU GET MOST BLOCKS. It's either, have limited blocks forever, or have to work your ass off getting them. I might make a review once the update comes out, but for now, three stars it is.

B004SD5GZ4|4.0|This ap works pretty much like the one that a person would have on his/her computer at home. Good ap to have.
0896898288|4.0|I purchased this as a gift for a friend.  She was very happy with it.  Can't wait to see some of her blocks.  Great book at a good price.
B00AZNEW5G|5.0|The movie was depressing but something every American should view at least one time, especially that you needed payback for 9/11.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I love this game.  I especially like being able to play the &#34;winning&#34; version.  After several trys, I always win!!!!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Great story. The plot is very different from what I usually read. It's a good read. I like it. Read this book.
B004MC8CA2|1.0|It used to work great with previous  versions, but now with 4.2.20 it stopped working. Time to find another Bible app.
B00BAVCD8A|3.0|It doesn't sound the same as their older stuff. The only songs that kind of sound like their older stuff are Young Volcanoes, The Phoenix, My Songs Know What you did in the Dark, and Save Rock n Roll. If you don't like pop, I wouldn't recommend this album.
B0095VP8D4|5.0|A new A10-5800K has a great performance, with a very good price, its cost vs performance is fair. I'd recommend it to everyone want to own average PC with FM2 motherboards from the great AMD
B005SUMBTU|4.0|As described. Very good movie. Nothing too heavy. I was able to watch with my daughter without her getting scared.
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|This is a great game to just relax and empty all the worries running through your mind, very, very relaxing
B005HSL626|4.0|EVEN my 2 1/2 year old can play this game. Colorful and fun for all ages. My new favorite game.
B00AZMFO9U|5.0|This gem was released almost unnoticed in the USA, but it topped the list when it was released in the UK.<br /><br />Anyone who thinks that Jennifer Lawrence and Anne Hathaway can act, should be forced to watch this lesson in acting from the very best.<br /><br />Dame Maggie & Pauline Collins were remarkable and stole every scene from the men.<br /><br />There wasn't a dry eye in the house and we were transfixed from beginning to end. I beg you to see this movie and when you do, you will want to add it to your collection. I wish I could give it 10 stars !!
1401219268|5.0|Alan Moore and Dave Gibbons at their best. This is what comics should be. Complex characters who you love to hate and hate to love.
B0000AYJXR|5.0|i first got it in 1997 when it was on VHS and i was glad to find it on DVD.
B00005LQ04|5.0|First off, I would like to say that I have been a loyal fan of Suspiria for about a year now. When I first saw it (last year), I had no idea what it was about. I just knew that Dario Argento was supposed to be good. So I went to my local DVD store, and picked up the Blue Underground version of Suspiria. Little did I know that I would soon become a huge \\"suspirian\\", and also a big Blue Underground supporter.<br />So it only seems logical that as soon as I saw this copy, I NEEDED it. But then I looked at the price, and said \\"Nope.\\" After about 2 weeks, the thing had been nagging me. So I got online and ordered it.<br />When it got here (rather fast), I ran to the mailbox. I was so excited! When I opened it up, I was not disappointed. There was some stills of the movie, a scene selection, and a little booklet (which contains an AMAZING interview with Jessica Harper). Then I flipped through the discs. It had everything the Blue Underground version had, AND a soundtrack. I was in LOVE. I've been listening to the soundtrack for a couple days now, and I just love it. I have yet to check out Special Features and the actual movie yet though :/. Anyone who loves Dario Argento should buy this. Thanks Anchor Bay, and thanks Amazon!
B006ZPJWBM|5.0|Tony Bennett has always been a marvelous voice in both decades gone by all the way up until today.  However, as wonderfully talented he is, he is also a much flawed person as shown by his limited understanding of patriotism, defense of country and the drug problem in the world.  He has since backtracked from his 2011 public comments that 'American military actions in the Middle East brought 9/11 to America ... ', and he remains steadfast in his mistaken belief that all drugs should be legalized.  Perhaps he has an ageist 'right' to exhibit his ignorance by virtue of having reached the grand old age of 85 (this reviewer is 83 years young!), but I'm not so forgiving of someone who exemplifies the old adage that 'there's no fool as an old fool.\\"  When deciding whether or not to purchase anything involving Tony Bennett remember: caveat emptor.
B002VPEAM6|5.0|I absolutely loved this book.  Fresh, witty, sarcastic.  Epistolary genre is usually not easy to read for me, but this one was diverse and worked really well.  The funniest parts were probably the exchanges between the terrorists.  Dr. Jones is a character who undergoes a radical change in life, aided by a somewhat mysterious sheikh who offers interesting musings on faith and possible results of salmon fishing.  I never thought such topics could turn out to be so delightful for me.  A charismatic book.  The ending left me wishing for a somewhat different ending, more forgiving for the characters - and I did not want to part with them.  Great read!
B001TH16DI|5.0|This item is GREAT, i bought it cause the price was right and im a star trek geek, i am very very satisfied with my purchase.<br />wether its for you or the STAR TREK FAN gift its great, i recommend it to anybody who loves star trek or sci fi !
B0027MJU00|2.0|Really out there. Crazy, crazy plot that gets more bizarre the longer the story conitnues.Can't say I really enjoyed it.
B002Q9MZHE|5.0|There probably aren't many operas the can be done in a movie format but La Boheme is certainly one of them.
B005LAJ16I|5.0|Enjoyed each episode - don't get Showtime but wanted to see what<br />everybody's talking about re: Homeland.  Was NOT disappointed!
B0054YIQK8|5.0|Getting Carmen off the stage and into the hands of the sexiest Carmen I've ever seen or heard is pure joy.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|It may not look like much but this is a very engaging puzzle game. It gets your mind going and I find I come back to it again and again. Highly reccomended!!
B008O2T3O0|2.0|This production seems to me to be very static, and the singers might as well be doing this work in concert mode. I would have been just as happy with a CD version of this production - maybe happier.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|What a fun game....I am having a great time playing this game. Looking forward to getting more dragons now! Who ever thought this grandma would be playing dragon games!
B0079IJ0R0|5.0|Maybe I'm simple minded but this is one of three versions of Carmen that I have in a Blu-ray release. It's must be that I can't get enough of the music and that I can't get enough of the character.
B0097GVJWQ|4.0|looking for the next one. hope it is as good as this one was. keep up up with games that keep you wanting to play.
B007UW9VWO|5.0|Perfection is easy to come by if you devote your life to it, and then do even more every year.
0300169787|4.0|Great book.  All future designers need to understand what art fashion is and what it could be.  This book puts things into perspective. Raw, talented and very original production. Love this book.
B0012HRJEA|5.0|The director of the Romeo + Juliet film Luhrmann matches Shakespeare's intention. The dialogue is concise but it goes along with the original story. The director just added a modern spin to the story, making the story easier to understand for young viewers. Luhrmann still hits the main theme that hatred can defeat love in the end shown by Romeo and Juliet's deaths. Overall Luhrmann's version think exceeds Shakespeare's initial intentions. I think Shakespeare would be amazed on how Luhrmann tied in his dialogue, which is really difficult to do. The movie also showed how Romeo wears his emotions on his sleeve. Romeo's instant action of killing Tybalt exceeded the original story's climax of the story. Luhrmann's use of camera angles and weather adds a finished touch and effect on the story. The Romeo + Juliet movie by Luhrmann is very interesting, entertaining, funny, and memorable.
B004QZ9PLU|5.0|Truly enjoyed this book!  It will be one that I read and re-read!  Reminiscient of &#34;The Notebook&#34; but unique in it's own way.  If I say more, I would give away everything...enjoy!
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|I love this game it's so cute I love finding nemo dory and his dad it is a great movie and its so perfect to learn new things about the covenant nieces play it too
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I love this game.  It's fun, challenging, and entertaining.  The only negative is that you have to wait for more energy.  I like that you can play and not spend any money, that's definitely a bonus for me.
B009YU62H2|5.0|Amazing album - especially satisfying for fans of DOTU and Superunknown.  Soungarden back at their 90s peak - they do not disappoint! Finally, a \\"comeback\\" albums that actually hits the mark.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I am not a big TV watcher but I could not stop watching this series until I had caught up to the coming season.  Now I'm just sorry that I didn't pace myself because now I have to wait until November for the new season to start!
B005LLSZNM|5.0|Very Good continued story line development, nice twists & turns while keeping true to the characters, now waiting ot see what happens in season 5
B00CDT41RY|2.0|Too long with too much dialog that didn't help to build characters. Exaggerated violence, poor editing. In spite of all the negatives, it was almost fun. It came off as an attempt for comedy, but wasn't.
0345803485|1.0|THE SUCCESS OF THIS BOOK IS A HUGE DISSAPPOINTMENT (INDEED THE END OF CIVILIZATION?)<br />IT WAS ALMOST PAINFUL TO READ IT...NOT BECAUSE OFF THE BDSM SCENES BUT BECAUSE OFF THE PLOT, THE STUPID CHARACTERS AND THE WRITING OF A 10 YEAR OLD.<br />IT'S TRUE WHAT A FAMOUS WRITER SAID: THIS BOOK MAKES \\"TWILIGHT\\" LOOK LIKE \\"WAR AND PEACE\\"...
B00AREIAI8|5.0|1 word. AMAZING. It has great graphics and I love the game and the way everything looks. This is a great app.
1451668945|2.0|\\"Daddy's Gone A Hunting\\" is a typical Mary Higgins Clark novel.  The chapters are super short which makes for quick reading.  Unfortunately, the plots in Ms. Clark's last few books remains the same ... predictable suspense/mystery with little character development.  I did not like any of the characters or parallel stories in \\"Daddy's Gone A Hunting.\\"  This is definitely not one of her better novels.  It's a good read for the beach or a weekend, but if you are looking for something with a lot of suspense or a plot with twists and turns try one of her earlier books.
B003F3NEBG|5.0|I love this version of Pride and Prejudice. It so closely follows the book that I can hardly find any inaccuracies. The acting is also phenomenal.<br /><br />This is by far the best portrayal of Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice and I would recommend this over any other version.
B00136Q6DA|5.0|This is an album that is full of good songs.  I love her voice!  Some of the songs are soothing while others are very passionate.  A good mix of songs.  Gravity is my favorite song on this album.
B004IYWN7C|5.0|This is one of my girlfriends favorite movies, I enjoyed it as well.<br />The movie brought a bunch of found memories of my childhood.<br />Overall this was a great movie, and wouldn't mind watching it another night.
B004ZRV3AU|4.0|works well. did what i wanted it to. Bottom bar to help keep in line does not stay very tight
0793544610|5.0|With a little patience you can get a lot, and I mean a lot from this book. I keep going through it though as Jimi was full of guitar genius and nuances. Tab friendly!<br />Have you ever been experienced? Well after tooling through this book, I have . . .
B008L1F91A|4.0|It is not the same level as a full on Koto sculpture but it is a great approximation and still high quality.
B0051OZ564|4.0|If you buy this movie for the story, prepare to be disappointed.  The story is flat and the end does bite, but that is because of the industry forcing the same movie types down the public's throat.  I NEVER pay attention to critics, as they seem to pan most of the best movies.  That being said, if you buy it for the STYLE of movie that it is, (read the Amazon review) then you will be pleasantly surprised.  The visuals in the movie are outstanding and the crossing genres blend together really well and they are a treat.  The most noticeable example of this would be the scene at the castle, with monster, knights and dragons and also WWII imagery.  The story such as it is, doesn't fulfill our stereotyped expectation, but does provide the discerning viewer the chance for thought and different method of storytelling.<br />I gave this four stars due to the wonderful visuals, would have given it 5 if the story line was stronger.  I liked this movie for the visual feast contained and the cross-history sub-stories.  I didn’t like the fact that the story also could have been as strong as the visuals to make it an even more powerful movie.<br />In spite of what I wrote above, I like a good story in addition to the stunning visuals.  It does deserve watching a couple of times to catch all that is going on.  I would recommend this movie to those who appreciate the extreme visual, steam punkish style that this movie provides.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Twist on the usual run of the mill abduction story.  Keeps one guessing.  Ending very unusual.  Good read that keeps you hooked.
075669812X|5.0|My 6 year old grandson loves this book.  He has memorized almost all the characters' descriptions and likes to play a game where we give him clues to the character and he guesses them.  Great book!!!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|For some reason, I don't seem to understand the ending. But I actually loved it! What a great trilogy of the hunger games
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|I love the original story and while I thought this was a great movie - in my opinion there is nothing to compare to the original story. I just wish that the movie makers would not add or subtract from the book. I am glad I have read  The Hobbit many times so I could spot the differences in the movie. Other than that it is a great movie and was very entertaining.
B004J64QSI|5.0|Les Miserables 25th Anniversary DVD is Excellent.  Alfie Boe and cast are amazing. The entire concert (symphony, stage lighting/production) are awesome!  Ordered the DVD from Amazon after viewing a section on KNPB, CH 5 Reno.<br />Very impressive production!  Kudos to all.
B005H2IAM6|5.0|So I remember watching Starblazers when I was kid and when I found this I just had to buy it. What a great adaptation of the original anime series. So much fun watching the cartoon come alive!
B005V20JKI|1.0|I had gotten this game over a year ago, and it ws fun enough to keep around even when various little accidents caused me to lose my progress.<br /><br />Unfortunately, even though this was a paid game when I first got it, this most recent update has introduced all sorts of insidious IAP: a level cap and locking of certain characters, both of which can be removed via payment. (But not by playing--these updates now hold the progress I had previously made ransom.)<br /><br />So, you now have to pay again to play the game that you paid to buy? Forget that.
B000VMFDW2|5.0|For anyone who is a war history enthusiast this is an amazing first hand glimpse of what it was like to be a marine in the Pacific Theater during WWII.  I've read many books about the European theater and there is a stark difference between the two. This book greatly details the daily struggles of a marine in the Pacific.
B001TH16DI|5.0|Grew up watching these films and they didn't disappoint. Great to see in blu ray and the sound quality was excellent.
B004J4WN0I|5.0|I put this series on par with the Dresden Files. A druid in modern day performing rituals, battling demos and working to protect his little piece of the world against angry deities.
160094048X|3.0|This is a good cookbook.<br />If I had known exactly what it was before I purchased it, I may not have gotten it.<br />It has a lot of good vegan cookie recipes, but they're not necessarily very practical.<br />I will keep the cookbook and will probably use it at some point.
B000F4RHB6|5.0|What a great CD, all the hits are here plus a new track which is just OK IMHO. I listen to it constantly!
1569242739|3.0|Good cookbook.<br />Not the most practical cookbook.<br />But if you're looking for good vegan cupcake recipes, this is a good place to find them.
B009PHQ9OA|5.0|Bastille is absolutely one of my favorite bands I have stumbled upon. The first song that obviously made me like them was \\"Pompeii,\\" and that song being amazing, made me decide to listen to give their album \\"Bad Blood\\" a try. Seriously Bastille's sound is very eccentric and different than anything, especially from any band I have listened to, and that is perhaps why I really enjoy them. The song \\"Flaws\\", is amazing, \\"Get Home,\\"\\"Oblivion,\\"\\"Laura Palmer,\\" and \\"Bad Blood\\" are probably my top favorite tracks, but the WHOLE entire album is great and if you watch their acoustic performances on YouTube they're just as amazing if not even BETTER than the recording. Overall this is one of the top three albums, \\"Bad Blood\\" is definitely a very well put album, with great hooks and beats. Some of their other stuff such as covers is just as amazing as well, their other album \\"Other People's Heartache Pt. 2\\" is just as amazing, haven't listened to Pt. 1 yet though album. Anyways one of my top three favorite bands, definitely recommend this wonderfully well put together, and I hope they come to the U.S. soon, especially here in Texas!
B007VUCAVO|5.0|Purchased day after received Kindle-Fire for Christmas! GREAT app for the $ I use it constantly!! Everyone should get this app!
B00APKIN1I|4.0|Watching the film is a must. You'll appreciate the album more. Corey Taylor definitely stood out for me.  Dave and Corey need to do an album together.
B007MB5OCE|4.0|Flowing, imaginative and great fun. World history and politics never more entertaining. Indeed luck and good fortune are sometimes more important than schooling and planning
B00B2YH7D6|5.0|It was a very fun, nostalgic trip. This film was better than I expected, and it gave me a stronger appreciation for those who still do things the \\"old way\\".
B005CA4SJW|5.0|Awesome value on this boxset. One of m'y favourite shows 3:)
B003TJ4YUQ|5.0|This album is no different from the first, it's brilliant. It's great to see something like this happening and to be bringing back uplifting music to the World, I know for sure that God is fully behind it. Thank you to Playing For Change and all of the musicians around the World for taking part in it.
B0000UJL96|5.0|This is the easily the best movie of the original crew after Wrath of Khan. You are easily glued to the edge of your seat. The acting is bar none. I highly recommend this classic film to any aficionados.
B001QOOCTE|5.0|I love the whole concept of Playing For Change and what it is doing to bring Humanity together. Every song I have heard from playing For Change is brilliant.
0307387178|4.0|Jon Krakauer's Into the Wild provides a stirring account of the life of Chris McCandless. While all the details of McCandless's life and death are not known, this book makes an attempt to connect the dots.<br /><br />All in all, this book is an interesting read. I have not heard of many people who are willing to strike out into the wilderness and live alone for an extended period of time. While McCandless was brave and ambitious is this regard, I couldn't help but think that maybe he was a bit too ambitious. It was awesome to learn about someone embodying the adventurous human spirit. This is something inspiring and respectable. But on the other end of the spectrum, it is wise to plan your adventures to some extent to ensure personal safety is a priority. McCandless seemed to have a disregard for his own safety and (somewhat) of a disregard to the awesome power of nature.<br /><br />With that being said, I'm sure McCandless had a deep appreciation and respect for Mother Nature. That is clear in the various encounters people had with him throughout the book. But as I said, perhaps he didn't have the right amount of respect for Her. Alas, I am simply another outsider reading about a man who seemed to have been very bright and in many ways was misunderstood. The allure of this book remains regardless if you think McCandless was a bit foolish or was someone whom you'd admire.
B009NY43NY|1.0|Rushed and predictable, the book did not even come close to living up to the hype. This is an early review so i won't let off any spoilers, which means I can't give clear examples for now. If, like me, you had to buy this book to know how things ended... Buy it with low expectations and a disappointed heart.<br />Will update in a few days with spoilers to give others a chance to read and process.
B007QPFGJW|3.0|All the Harry Hole novels are a little depressing but usually end on an upbeat since he always gets the perp.  And the mystery is always engrossing.  I kept waiting for that in this one but, by the time Harry gets the bad guy, you really don't care anymore.  Read the earlier Harry Hole novels first.  Then. if you're still a fan try this one. But be forewarned; you may not like the ending.
B007B6VOG0|3.0|If you like the first two songs from this album that played on the radio, that's what you're paying for.  Luckily it was only $3.99 because the remainder of the album stinks.
B00AB55BS0|5.0|They did a great job of keeping to the intent of the books and not editing out important scenes.  Some of the character images  The actors that portrayed the individuals were for the most part right on too.  If you enjoyed the books this wont be a disappointment.  It actually helps understand some of the visualizations that I had a hard time with.
B004HYXW1O|5.0|This album is filled with great songs.  This band is really talented and I got my money's worth with this purchase.
B004EPYZV2|2.0|Ghost Protocol does not compare to the original. The plot and character development are lacking although there is not much more one can do to prolong a dying series. The special effects are good and the new gadgets are cool but that's about all this movie offers.
B0075MFS9Y|3.0|I was very happy with my purchase but the case arrived broken.  The cd was unharmed. But very happy cd wasn't broken.
1442486937|4.0|According to Holly Black and Tony DiTerlizzi, the text of this story was left for them by three mystery kids.<br /><br />With that stab at blurring the boundaries between fantasy and reality, these two authors slip easily into a haunted house tale that rapidly blossoms into a story of hidden fae and strange creatures. The first of the Spiderwick Chronicles -- \\"The Field Guide\\" -- is a staggering brief story that sets up mysteries, marvels and everything that come after.<br /><br />After their parents' divorce, the Grace kids -- teenage Mallory and nine-year-old twins Jared and Simon -- move with their mother to a crumbling old Victorian house, owned by a weird old aunt. Jared is having a rough time with all of this, but he's distracted from his personal woes by a \\"squirrel\\" scuttling around inside the walls. And their investigations reveal a strange little stash of items that were obviously not taken by a squirrel.<br /><br />An exploratory trip in a dumbwaiter takes Jared to a hidden library full of strange books on mythic creatures -- and soon strange things start happening to the family. Jared's further investigations uncover a strange little book called \\"Arthur Spiderwick's Field Guide To The Fantastical World Around You,\\" a little guide to faery creatures. Jared begins to believe that the unbelievable might be true -- that there are faeries causing trouble in his new home -- but his siblings are a bit more reluctant.<br /><br />For the record, \\"The Field Guide\\" is a short book in a short series full of short books. It's only about a hundred pages of heavily-illustrated text, and we're not talking large pages. It's more like the first chapters of a longer novel -- and it ends on a bit of a cliffhanger.<br /><br />But Holly Black's writing style definitely makes it worth reading. Though the storyline is pretty simple, she weaves a web of subtle, eerie strangeness around the seemingly ordinary circumstances, and builds an increasing sense of dusty, leaf-strewn age around the house. And despite the Victorian house, the sprites and faery creatures here are anything but Victorian -- sometimes ugly, bizarre or malicious (such as when Mallory's hair is tied to her bed).<br /><br />And Tony DiTerlizzi's artwork is simply perfect for the story that he and Black are telling. He crafts lots of intricate pen-and-ink drawings, shadowy depictions of the decayed Victorian mansion, and illustrations of the weirder aspects of the Spiderwick estate (like the dusty library, or the vaguely Satanic door-knocker). The highlights are the old scribbled-on papers of Arthur Spiderwick, including a picture of a household boggart.<br /><br />The main characters are also quite believable: Mallory is a loving but slightly brittle teenager, and the mom is clearly struggling to stay afloat after her divorce. And the twins Jared and Simon (who can be told apart by their hairstyles) make good protagonists for the book, especially since they're so different -- Simon is a tidy animal enthusiast, while the more prominent Jared is a kid who is starting to sink into trouble after his parents' divorce.<br /><br />\\"The Field Guide\\" is a good opening chapter for the Spiderwick Chronicles, building up a sense of suspense, eerie fantasy and otherworldly creatures.

B008G12ERC|5.0|I have all of their CDs and I love every one of them.  The great part is that this purchase came with an autorip so I could put it on my phone and listen to it while exercising or plugged in to my car, before I even received the cd!
0765337541|5.0|Ender Wiggin is a very unusual boy -- he's a brilliant tactician, a genius, and a despised \\"third\\" in a future that only allows two children. He's also six years old.<br /><br />And despite the fact that Orson Scott Card's sci-fi classic is about a little boy learning how to be a warrior, \\"Ender's Game\\" is a pretty gripping and sometimes grim adventure story. The descriptions of children being taught out how to be cold-blooded warriors is pretty creepy, but the well-developed future world that Card comes up with is pretty awesome.<br /><br />After a fight with a gang of bullies, Ender Wiggin is approached by an army officer who wants him to join the elite Battleschool, where kid geniuses become soldiers -- basically because aliens are about to attack Earth AGAIN and may end up wiping out the human race. His brother Peter is too wild and cruel, and his beloved sister Valentine is too mild-mannered.<br /><br />Ender accepts, and quickly finds himself in a dog-eat-dog space school where he soon becomes loathed for the special treatment the teachers occasionally give him -- when they aren't observing his every move. And it soon becomes obvious that Ender has a natural ability that exceeds that of most of the Battleschool recruits: he instinctively knows how to outmaneuver his opponents and protect himself in a fight, even if he annoys some of the \\"army\\" commanders who don't like being outshone.<br /><br />Back on Earth, his brother and sister try to alter the increasingly unstable politics of Earth by subtle manipulation of the public, a situation that may bring the ruthless Peter into greater power. And as Ender reaches the end of his training, he faces both the buggers and the knowledge of what he is capable of.<br /><br />\\"Ender's Game\\" is kind of an unusual space opera, because the actual war between humans and buggers is not front-and-center until the last act of the story. Up until then, it's about following Ender and his equally unusual siblings as they develop prematurely into adulthood -- these are genius kids who can reshape entire worlds, but you're not really sure that they SHOULD.<br /><br />Card writes in a detailed but brisk style, with pretty realistic dialogue and some ugly dark spots (the description of Peter flaying a squirrel... for no reason). Ender's time at Battle School and Command School feel rather slow at times, only for things to blossom in the final laps of the novel -- Card suddenly turns all our feelings and expectations on their heads. The tragedy of children turned into soldiers becomes even more tragic as we discover what the war is actually all about.<br /><br />As you'd expect from Fascist Hogwarts In Space, there are a lot of kids at Battle School who are developed to certain degrees. But the center of the story is Ender himself -- and despite being a tactical genius with loads of natural ability, Ender never seems like a Wesley Crusher.

B009KEN87O|5.0|I really liked this game, in my spare time I play this.... plus it kind of reminds me of that arcade game where you shot down a bunch of ships.... it's just all in all a good, fun game!!!!
B0031RAOVY|4.0|I wanted to fall to the ground with my pillow and just cry.  What happen?  Did I get the &#34; Im a baby syndrome...
B005D9MUWY|5.0|I have used this app for a while now and it has saved me lots of time.  Several times my phone has gone kaput and I ended up having to retype the message  SwiftKey saved me by remembering what I entered.
B009NY43NY|1.0|I do not write reviews, but I could not let this book go without one. I would give it no stars if I could. I have come to expect a certain quality of book for the money I pay, I did not get it.  I loved this series when it started. I am so sorry I paid for this book. Did not like the story, did not like the ending.  It was awful.  Ruined the whole series for me.  I would like my money back for this one, Charlaine Harris should have stopped way before she wrote this one.  See other reviews for story line.  It was so bad I couldn't write it out again.  I will not be buying any more of her books.
B009NY43NY|1.0|Thank you all for your reviews. I won't spend my time or money to only be disappointed. I have long loved the series but it seemed to have changed after the tv series came out.
B000SEI230|5.0|It was a great book, it held your reading interest all the way thru, look forward to reading more of his books
B0055S348W|5.0|I downloaded this app quite a while ago, possibly 3 phones ago. Currently runs on my GS2 and Galaxy Tab 10.1v without issues. Recognized my Oki printer and works great with a generic driver.<br /><br />Very easy to use - can print from a pdf, or file - say if you were to save a file from google drive. You can also print from a url by merely copying the url and pasting into the app. There is also a few other printing options that I don't recall.<br /><br />Definitely an app of convenience. Print whatever you need in just a couple minutes from your phone or tablet device, not having to wait for a computer to start. I've printed a few websites, lots of recipes, even event tickets.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|A super hot romance between two people with a damaged past each.  Loved the way it was written, as well as the story itself!  Can't wait for book 3!
B000BW7QWW|5.0|I watched the series and when I saw there was a movie that ended the series I wanted it. It is a great ending to the series !!!
B009FZFONO|5.0|Such a convenient way to catch up on Season 3! I would highly recommend purchasing Walking Dead Season 3 from Amazon!
B00371XIJE|5.0|I had watched this movie on cable television but I love it so much more without all the commercials. Definitely a keeper. Will watch many more times I'm sure.
B0028IDXDS|5.0|My grandson still uses this at 10 months to gum as he is teething. Very soft, easy to find, very affordable for the length of time using
B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|This was a somewhat cheap mouse compared to many others I've seen, It does exactly what it says and has a brilliant feel to it.<br />Would recommend to any who are curious about purchasing a gaming mouse.
B000YMDQQ4|5.0|I like all of Neil Gaiman's works, and this was no exception.  Easy read of 4 short stories in typical Gaiman style.
B0028MBKVG|5.0|I had no idea that ultra-marathons even existed! Great entertainment for those who don't run, and good info for those who do.
B0043JDUNS|4.0|Watched this prior to seeing Part 3 so I could refresh my memory!  Good movie, but Part I is by far the best!
B008XKSW7M|4.0|Quite the cast of characters for this movie- Jennifer Lopez, Elizabeth Banks, Anna Perkins, Chris Rock, Brooklyn Decker, and others.<br /><br />The movie covers the path to pregnancy for several couples. It does a good job demonstrating that the Hollywood, romanticized notion of a \\"perfect pregnancy\\" is possible but only one of several possibilities. Some women will breeze through their 9 months and come out the other end no worse for the wear. For this movie, Brooklyn Decker sneezed and her baby came out. If only all labors were this easy! Elizabeth Banks had a much rougher time, experiencing all of the negatives associated with childbearing.<br /><br />There was also the nontraditional version of a couple deciding to adopt. It was nice they provided some variety, but I was thinking they could have just as easily used a gay or lesbian couple to fill these roles. Perhaps the creators feared some sort of backlash, but it would have been a good place for its use and not changed the story one iota.<br /><br />If you go into this movie hoping for tips on dealing with your pregnancy, good luck. This was more of a reflection on pregnancies in general and the gambit of experiences for these couples. Some surprising topics were covered, such as when Anna Kendrick and her boyfriend lost their baby or the almost death during childbirth. But all in all, it was gently poking fun at the events leading up to childbirth. While not all that funny (it did invoke a few laughs), it is a decent film worth watching once...and that's it.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|My 6 year old daughter loves this game. This game is a great change of pace from all the shoot em up games that are out there. It lets little girls be little girls.
B00CKOYVG8|5.0|This game is really fun. I mean loads of fun. Everybody that's complaining about needing a facebook profile to play, its a facebook app! That was the sole purpose of this game.
B0045HCJRG|4.0|This dvd, like the clint eastwood set that I purchased has audio quality issues in the early portions of the movie.

B002QEXN2K|5.0|I got this to give as a gift to a relative, and they love it! This album's got some great songs on it! The price was great, and the disc is in great condition. It took a while to ship, but it came from the UK, so I won't complain.
0062238868|5.0|A soldiers look at how the Iraq war was really fought. City by city. A very good read. Couldn't put it down!

B008XX6J4C|5.0|Recommend to anyone enjoying music of any kind.  Incredible the way they re-imagine known tunes with the two instruments.  Found the Piano Guys on YouTube.  Watched and listened to them many times.  Had to have the CD to listen to them without the computer.  The Piano Guys are the greatest!  Looking forward to receiving the next CD/DVD in late May 2013.
B000RPTQ1C|5.0|This Coldplay album is awesome! So many great songs! Disc quality is great, price was great, just what I was looking for. Took a while to ship, but it was coming from the UK, so that was expected.
B00B9EQS98|5.0|Nice caricature’s movie, very entertained for the whole family. Good to have in your movie’s library. It's one of the best ever seen.
B005IZLPKQ|3.0|This is an awesome movie! I bought it used, and usually the product description is accurate (as far as the condition of the product). The disc I received had some scratches that cause the movie to freeze/skip in some spots, but the price and shipping speed were excellent! I'll try cleaning the disc, and see if that helps.
B000VNMMQG|5.0|I would recommend this movie to everyone.  It's wonderful and I love the subject matter.  Based on a true story of course.  The acting is very very good.  The music is wonderful (Amazing Grace - bagpipes).
B0083SBMBM|5.0|Shipped fast, disc quality was great, great price, such a good movie! Didn't need the special edition or blue ray version. Just what I was looking for!
B00BE97ONM|4.0|I think that the book captured what it would be like being a mentally ill person. Most definitely had a few surprises in the story.job well done.
B004LWZWGA|5.0|This movie is amazing! It's one of my all time favorites! The Ultraviolet Digital Copy is a plus to this purchase. Now I have the movie on a disc, and on my iPod/computer!

B001BFFTO0|5.0|These boots look really nice, I like them. I usually wear 11 in sneakers but I got these in 10.5 and they fit perfect and feel very comfortable to me! I would totally recommend these.
B005SS2QXS|3.0|Stretches over time and then ends up covering the camera lens.  Pretty good protection from basic drops otherwise.  More words required.
B007ZYJMU8|5.0|What more can we ask from a film: to be deeply moved, to be involved in such a way we forget our surroundings, and for this to be done so eloquently.... This film is highly accomplished on all of those levels, and more.
B000SEGUDE|5.0|Makes my wandering life much easier :)<br />I wanted to understand the movie better. Hope I can get it - not easy to read through at one go..
B00C7TAF3Y|4.0|Loved the game. Very different from what I've placed before.  Hard to stop once you have started to play. Addictive game.
B008HJGPVO|5.0|The length of the stylus is like having a pen in hand. Dual tip, great. Would recommend this to anyone wanting a quality stylus
B007MDB6L0|5.0|Movie was amazing!! Kids love it!!<br />I would recommend this movie to any family!! Great way to spend good family time!

0345803507|5.0|I was especially happy with the ending in Book 3 Fifty Shades Freed. Christian & Anastasia were truly meant to be.
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|This game is badass...I truly enjoy playing it and being able to build new armor. I would definitely recommend this game to my friends!!!
0345803493|5.0|I really, really enjoyed reading Book 2 Fifty Shades Darker.  It was the most intriging book I've read in a long time.
193700788X|1.0|To sum it up in one word - I'm disheartened.<br /><br />***********************SPOILER ALERT****************************<br /><br />My best friend and I began reading the series 7 years ago and she stopped reading around book 8, believing that Ms. Harris was mailing it in.  I continued reading, sure that the brilliance of the earlier books would return and believing I owed Sookie that chance.  I'm sorry to say my confidence was ill-placed. The series started out quirky, sexy and fun and has turned into predictable plot lines, unbelievable characters and now, a shoddy wrap-up.  If you are a fan of the books (or of what the books once were), I strongly recommend not reading this last book.  I confess that I'm a Bill-lover, but I would have been happy to see Sookie with Eric or even with Alcide (Harris would have to undo the equally shoddy character assassination she performed on Alcide last book).  But Sam?  Boring, older-brother-esque, permanently-in-the-friend-zone Sam?  Your fans deserved better than that, Charlaine.<br /><br />I would say much, much more, but what is the point?  Do yourself a favor and save the money.  Your goldfish could write a better ending for free.
B009KS4XRO|3.0|The developers keep adding new rooms, games etc. But each time they do it messes up for the players. Fun and love it but kindle users are the last to get updates and their tech support is worthless. So addicting I keep playing, but the glitches get tiresome.... worth the cost of free but I wouldn't spend any money to play.
6305692572|5.0|This is a sweet, tender movie about dysfunction. I have watched it many times and recommend it.<br />The acting is wonderful. How can you go wrong with Andy Garcia and Meg Ryan?
B000WN7NEQ|5.0|Cheyanne and Vanessa Williams had chemistry! The music and foot work was inspiring, teachable to the observer and the passion Rafael and Ruby had for each other and for Latin dancing was awesome. As an Afro-Cubana, I felt this movie reflected a lot of things about our culture...all the fun things, and things borne out of necessity. So maybe the movie is personal to me, but it makes me want to dance, to love life and be in love. The Latin performances by renown Cuban and Puerto Rican groups and singers was a treat, and the club scene dance where everyone danced together, I'm sure drove Latins to salsa clubs in droves. Rhonda Haines, I hope you do it again. Your work was inspiring! Oh...and P.S. Get Cheyanne to do more American movies!
B001FB4VXU|5.0|Great cast, so worth watching again and again. The writing is exceptional!<br />A perfect stocking stuffer. Great for all ages! Bazinga!!
B004EPZ070|5.0|I was compelled throughout the entire movie!  I was telling the characters what to do and what I wanted to have happen.
B0016CEGZQ|5.0|This is the book that led to the films Yojimbo, Fistful of Dollars, and Last Man Standing although for some reason the film makers in all three cases refused to credit it. This is Hammett of the first order featuring the Continental Op character. If you don't love this book then you just don't get Dashiell Hammett and what he stood for at all.
B006GWO5NE|4.0|This was bought for my Grandson.  I have not heard anything bad from him, so I assume he is happy with it.
B00CJ7EK4E|4.0|Rod Stewart has still got it. He has always been a great singer with a uniquely brilliant voice and the skill and musicality to put a song over with real feeling, but some of his choice of material and production style has often made me wonder whether any of the old magic was still there. In places on this album it certainly is. It's variable material, but the good bits are really good.<br /><br />The album opens with a decent but pretty standard pop song, She Makes Me Happy which Rod lifts a bit above the ordinary, and in It's Over it's good to see that he has the dignity to sing about the end of a marriage rather than teenage heartbreak, but he shows that his real greatness is still there in Brighton Beach, a beautiful, deeply evocative song about the recall of first love. It may not be the enduring masterpiece that I Don't Want To Talk About It is, for example, but it affects me nearly as deeply.<br /><br />I won't go through the entire album - there's a good variety of pop, dance and ballads most written by Stewart himself and often reflecting on ageing and times past. Some bits are pretty ordinary, some are very good. I think the three bonus tracks are among the best here, by the way. They're a little more bluesy and a little less produced which gives them a genuineness which I like a lot, and I think they're well worth the extra.<br /><br />The thing that strikes me most strongly is that Rod sounds sincere throughout, probably because he's mainly singing his own songs. He never sounds as though he's going through the motions and even in the places where the production is a bit schmaltzy (which is too often for me, I must say), or the parts when material isn't great, the band sounds fairly ordinary or the lyrics are a bit naff, he sings as though he really means it and manages to lift the whole thing well above the average.<br /><br />Rod Stewart has made some albums which I think would fall into the UN classification of Cruel And Unusual Punishment, so it's good to see that a truly great singer can still make a good record. It certainly isn't up there with Every Picture Tells A Story, but it's not bad at all and has moments of brilliance. Recommendedod to see that a truly great singer can still make a good record. It certainly isn't up there with Every Picture Tells A Story, but it's not bad at all and has moments of brilliance. Recommended
B005K17RU0|5.0|I like that this is so complete and informative.  It gives me what I need for planning my day or week and can feel pretty confident.
B000SEI230|5.0|a walk to remember is one of most powerfully emotional books that I have ever read. The story effectively  depicts the life and death of an angel, and that God is with us at all times. the book conveys to us the way God wants us to live our lives and if we do live our lives the way he wants,than people around us will eventually do the same.  what a wonderful world this would be!!!
B008Z9L94O|3.0|I was chomping at the bit to get my hands on this vinyl since I couldn't afford the original album release.  I was a little disappointed though.  The sound doesn't quite seem right.  Lots of noise and almost clipping sounds on several of the songs.  Don't know if its just my copy, several in the pressing or all of them that are affected.  It sure is pretty sitting on my shelf though.........
B00AEFY0F2|5.0|i have loved this movie from the first time i saw it,and it is one i will watch over and over again.
B005MW8CUG|5.0|Awesome collection from one of the greats.  Very cool to hear the demos and unreleased versions.  DVD was amazing as well.
B00CBRADU2|2.0|It seems everyone knows the drill in the internet age.. criminal goes free, western town, upright sheriff, good girl, bad boy, dumb deputy, free spirit in charge of arcane weapons(?) against the suave, the sophisticated, cruel, vindictive armani suit wearing criminall. Evil cannot stand against good. The law must hold. Ah, it's not too bad, but, if one pays attention and I did, it wasn't hard for me to see it all coming from way, way off, like a dust devil, no, dust storm on the flat horizon of the Arizona desert.<br />Arnie's fun as the codger/sheriff who upholds morality, decency as he enjoys the peace of a small town after fighting crime in LA. But heck, Shane couldn't find peace in a small town either. Trouble just has a way..... That's about it for the story. If you enjoy westerns, Fast and Furious,Jackass, with small town corn thrown in- it'll fill the bill. Forest Whitaker does his best at acting. The rest try to measure up, but it's a mix of pone and car oil, with a chaser of speed and guns.
B001ANSSDC|4.0|From the movie promos I expected a fluffy read. This is not that. More serious and deeper than I expected. A good quick read
B007N31YFW|5.0|Very Innovative, loco-motive, and provocative to the ears in a positive way! Should watch and listen! Rock on! Highly recommended
B003ODIZL6|3.0|I love it a lot to help my son's home work on vocabluary at school slot some times at school
0385340990|5.0|It was a fun way to learn about something I knew noting about and from p a personal point of view.
B005DOKL3E|2.0|I chose the rating because the sleeve doesn't fit the Kindle Fire once the body suit is on it.<br />I wish I had known the two items wouldn't work together.<br />I would advise anyone buying the body suit not to buy the sleeve.
193700788X|1.0|I've been loyal to Ms. Harris and the series since book one.  I've been patient since her writing started unraveling in the past few books, thinking \\"maybe the next book will get better\\".  This one was a very, very quick unfortunate read!<br /><br />But this, being her \\"finale\\" book was just ridiculous.  What a way to go out - fill those pages with lot's of \\"blah blah blah & more \\"yada yada yada\\" because there is just no intensity there anymore or anything coming from the heart.  Or, you just wanted to get your commitment on the series \\"over\\".<br /><br />I thought Sookie deserved much more respect - not the almighty $$ on the finale book.  I feel a great loss over what I felt was lack of respect Ms. Harris also gave the characters - I felt they deserved much more detail and better closure.<br /><br />Oh wait, we have still the coda \\"After Dead: What Came Next in the World of Sookie Stackhouse\\" yet to be released..(insert intense :rolleyes:)<br /><br />Don't buy this book.  Save your money!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I'm really loving this game. My wife and children take turns adding to the score.I It's just great passing our kindle around to see who is going to get the highest score at subway surfer! I love it so much, I downloaded the subway surfer on my phone, and now I play it everywhere!
B001IBIHQ4|5.0|Absolutely perfect quality. We totally loved this set and have leant it to several friends. All who have viewed have commented on the quality.
B00280LYIC|5.0|this was so much better than the movie.. then again the BOOKS are always better than the movie! I wish id have read them before the movie came out!
8866137626|3.0|The bad thing s, you need to take the picture with your phone or tablet. It's OK. I am still trying top get used to it.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|this was awesome!!  the ending left me wanting more..i cant wait for the next installment!!!  Thank you George for writting this series!
B00957T6X6|5.0|The best fantasy series ever written.  Once you pick it up it is next to impossible to put back down. Very complex and full of unbelievable twists and turns that you would never imagine.  If I could give a hundred stars I would.<br /><br />Just my opinion but I didn't like the bundle pack. It was a little annoying flipping to the maps and genealogies.  I know it's more expensive but I would buy five separate books if I bought them again.
193700788X|4.0|This arrived on my doorstep at 2pm yesterday and I finished it by 6:30 -- absolutely glued to the story. The author ended it as she planned, tied up many loose ends in the Sookieverse, and let us know that many of our favorite characters had grown up, matured, and were going to be OK. I'm good with the ending. Maybe not as *I* would have preferred, but then, I'm not the author. It's her story with characters she created -- I'm just along for the ride, and a good long ride it was.<br /><br />I did note that there were lots of babies born, on the way, or hinted at -- so maybe there might be some future adventures in Bon Temps as they grow up and start asking questions!<br /><br />Thanks, Charlaine!
B00BPA2PBG|5.0|This is a fine example of pushing the boundaries on technology that is readily available. It pushes the bit rate for blu-rays as far as it can go, in order to preserve the original content. The transfer looks to be about as good as the last blu-ray release. But the micro blocking effect is minimalized and the nice grainy film image stays intact. I have a 55\\" Tv so the difference is noticeable when looking at the two blu-rays from side to side. Don't double dip if you already own the previous blu-ray. The difference is not great enough to validate the purchase. On the other hand, if you don't already own the movie or if you have a 4k TV, than this is the release for you.<br />Just to note. Sony is not the first ones to push the blu-ray bit rates, just the first to advertise it. There are a small amount of blu-rays that have done this in the past.
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|Great calc app!! Very easy to use &amp; really like how it looks.  it is very easy to read.  I would recommend it to others.
B005LAIIPS|5.0|Phooey on the critics. This is a thoroughly enjoyable movie that was worth the watch. In fact, worth several.<br /><br />Once I got the idea that this was a concurrently running program with the Treadstone situation, I was able to focus on the characters and situations without expecting this to be like the three previous movies. The scripting is great, and there are a host of fine actors who thoroughly do their part. The camera work and musical scoring are notable. Good stuff.<br /><br />Jeremy is intense, human, believable, and obviously an athlete. Rachel does an outstanding job of combining shocked overwhelm with critical survival instincts. It is refreshing not to see \\"flouncing\\" when she runs. Ed Norton always delivers... the list goes on and on.<br /><br />I have one question: Who was the last Outcome agent? They only show pictures /scenes of five.
B000QCS8TW|3.0|Felt a bit too much like reading about a chess game.  Too long, too many characters, too much battle strategy and after all these pages I learned nothing, was not moved emotionally one way or the other...only just stubborn to finish and mildly entertained.  I dont get what all the fuss is about.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I like this game since it has a lot of automated features.  I recommend it if you like to play a basic game of solitaire.
0143122916|5.0|As others have noted, an extremely important work;  The author has painstakingly documented the veracity of this tale.  This is so important - one shudders to think - it is still going on now!  And, given how little leaks out, in the post-NorKo future - the deniers will have an easy time saying it never happened!
193700788X|1.0|The ending is so devastating, like I don't even have words. Why on earth CH chose Sam to be the HEA is beyond me, this book doesn't even make sense in comparison to the way sookie is in the previous books, I'm just not convinced. Such a shame that such a good series was ended so badly!
B004G5VFOU|5.0|To me, this release has always epitomized the best of Traffic; long, jammy jazzy tunes interspersed among folkier and rockier songs. Winwood is in fine form throughout. The title track remains one of the best recordings of the era; a sinister, ancient folk song give a lift from Winwood and Traffic. Empty Pages and Glad are also stand-out tracks.<br /><br />The sound has been remixed on the anniversary release and it sounds great! Buy it if you like great classic rock tunes.
0689835604|5.0|I'm a fan of Karen Lutz and her Lift-the-Flap books for babies<br />and toddlers.  This is the first book my grandson wants to<br />read when we're together.

B00AECGQF2|5.0|This app is great for if you get bored. I like it because the options are endless. This is a great app period·.
B00BSWMITK|5.0|This is just plain good music. I'm not sure how many more albums Joe is going to make but I hope he keeps them coming.
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|This game is a type of Temple Run-ish kind of game, except this has enemies,<br />A.I.M. enemies. Most are easy.<br />  The reason I play this game a lot is because:<br /><br />1) The game is exceptionally fun.<br />2) The graphics are AMAZINGLY nice (The game takes up about 0.8 GB<br />3) This game has daily challenges (as most games of this sort do) that are actually bosses.<br /><br />The missions are partly challenging, but are very rewarding.<br /><br />If you are an Iron Man fan, this is the game for you. If not, you could try it (you would like it) but could end up deleting it because of space problems. My Fire HD has 16 GB of space, so I have got memory to waste.<br /><br />Thanks for reading! :D<br /><br />WARNING: HIGHLY ADDICTIVE
B000EDWKXS|5.0|Can't say much different.  It's not much different - a few more scenes, maybe a bit more gruesome.  It's not a classic, but if you like action, irony, humor and Nicolas Cage, it's a winner.
B00BOL22GY|5.0|\\"Vikings\\" is a miniseries that deals with the Viking discovery of England and the \\"lands to the west.\\"  Protagonist Ragnar Lothbrok is a restless, ambitious man who is sworn to fealty to a tyrannical chieftain.  His chieftain fears Ragnar's ambitions, and therein lies a fascinating story of jealousy, intrigue, and power.  The acting, cinematography, and storyline of Vikings are all first-rate.  This story is also historically accurate.  Until the Vikings learned how to navigate and sail the open ocean England was protected from their depredations.  Once that changed England and other European lands were subject to the full \\"fury of the Northmen\\" and a terrible age of slaughter and plunder ensued, which lasted for many centuries.<br /><br />\\"Vikings\\" in no way tries to whitewash the vicious and bloodthirsty nature of the Northmen Vikings, but it does humanize them and give the viewer insight on how things looked from the Viking perspective.  The Vikings viewed raiding and plunder as the natural state of affairs, and they were good at it.  They had their own laws and religion among themselves and they lived by these, and this series brings this out as well.<br /><br />This is a first-rate miniseries which I trust will not end with only nine episodes.  The story has just begun!  RJB.

B00005JKJA|5.0|If you have seen any of the of the other films by MR. Lynch you may agree he uses a fair amount of dreamworld aspects mixed in with reality.  Previously mostly in and around small towns and lonely spaces.  But with MD he flips the camera around and sees Hollywood itself as a strange place mixed with dreams and nightmares.<br /><br />Major bummer that this film/show did not get to be made into a series.  Its pretty clear from the film that he did his best to use what he had and put his ideas into just a few hours....when it should have been spread out over at least 8 to sixteen episodes. [btw: there is a version of the twin peaks pilot that tried to do the same thing and crunch it all down to two hours with just ok results].<br /><br />I noticed alot of people trying to solve this movie like it was a crossword puzzle but I think DL doesnt want everything to be solved.  So as much as I liked this movie its mostly because it points to what could have been developed over more shows (the strange old couple that seem so happy to throw \\"betty\\" into a town that could eat her alive (and later come back to taunt her in a very bizarre sequence that to me hints they are crazy spirits of some kind; the cowboy; the director, the police, the thugs and the strange gangsters).<br /><br />Well lots worse things happen in this world than a show being cancelled before it even starts so I just have to deal with it.  But for me part of the fascination with this film is imagining what more could have been involved (on the other side twin peaks and other shows went on too long and tried to reveal/explain too much).<br /><br />Its worth seeing this film with DL's Inland Empire which also deals with a women caught in the bizarre world of hollywood. Despite his dark humour, DL seems to really care about the people in his movies (though they go through a lot).  I for one think he was both films were a slight change in his vision.  MD and IE start really talking about hollywood being vortex ofhuman desires and dreams and people damaged very badly by desires (in particular women who are the center of the desires)...and this vortex spreads back out over space and into the past (back to Europe, the old country).  But that is a big oversimplification.  The ghouls, the creeps and angels (some applying to the same character) all have a story to be told as well .  Its a very strange world and a place like hollywood is where the strangeness is even greater.

B0079XPUOW|2.0|The book should have ended on Chapter 24.  The Codas (in my opinion) sucked.  I felt like Scalzi had a contract to write a 300 page book and was struggling to fill the final pages so he wrote the Codas (which was filled with drawn out meaningless conversation).<br /><br />This was the first book I read on a tablet (how sci-fi fitting)

B007H1HQW0|3.0|I figured the bad reviews were written by dummies who couldn't read directions or were just clumsy.  My apologies.  The basic concept of this cutter is good.  There's plenty of adjustment capabilities for different size bottles and different lengths of cut.  The one big design flaw is the aluminum bar at the bottom of the jig that parallels the cutter handle.  The angle between the cutter handle and the aluminum bar determines how well the carbide cutter wheel approaches the glass surface.  You need to be able to lock in that angle, but a small screw and wing nut doesn't do the job.  If that angle changes as your pressing and rotating the bottle, the cutter wheel lifts off the glass and ruins the cut, and the bottle.  Also, as you press and rotate the bottle, the cutter slips off center and off the bottle.  Happened to me several times, so I determined that you could only rotate the bottle about 10 degrees before you have to reposition your hand.<br /><br />My success rate is about 50%.  It is critical that the scribed line be perfect, but this jig doesn't allow it consistently.<br /><br />Also, after eight bottles, the first carbide wheel was worn out!  So do the math. You'll only get about about 48 cuts before having to replace the cutter.  Not a big deal, really, but I would expect a carbide wheel to last much longer than that.<br /><br />I'm probably going to build my own jig, one that cradles the bottle in a holder and allows more downward force on the cutter wheel while you rotate the bottle.<br /><br />I'll be returning this item, and I don't recommend it.

B00BSWMITK|4.0|Satriani has assembled a world class ensemble to perform on his latest album.<br /><br />UNSTOPPABLE MOMENTUM - Aptly titled, as Vinnie Colaiuta propels this song from start to finish with a forward momentum akin to that of one of the drummer's strongest influences, Tony Williams.  The song is composed in 5/8 and Colaiuta's penchant for evening out odd-time signatures comes into play, even while he dares to take the piece out of bounds with some of his patented beat displacement and soloing over the final 50 seconds or so...a jazz musician's sense bringing a heavy dosage of sophistication to the simplicity of shred.<br />CAN'T GO BACK - An impeccable groove to accompany tasteful and economical melodies - Satriani's tone and phrasing remind me of Jeff Beck on this one...probably my favorite track on this disc.<br />LIES AND TRUTH - Contains a wonderfully syncopated \\"drums n bass\\" pattern during the verse sections and then briefly breaks into some heavier riffing along the lines of Hendrix's \\"Fire\\" before the chorus blasts through with a straight ahead rock n roll rhythm...an extremely intriguing song throughout.<br />THREE SHEETS TO THE WIND - I was prepared to approach this track as a mere novelty song, but it's a pleasure to hear the band cut loose as the song unfolds - and I can appreciate the 'drunken horn section' brought to the track with the assistance of Keneally's keyboards.<br />I'LL PUT A STONE ON YOUR CAIRN - A brief respite from the fierce and aggressive sounds that surround this interlude. Judging by the title, Satriani intended the piece to have a Gaelic influence - Scottish bagpipes perhaps?<br />A DOOR INTO SUMMER - Straight ahead and mid-tempo rock with catchy commercial melody lines.<br />SHINE ON AMERICAN DREAMER - A simple song composed for the common man...not turning a blind eye to the death of the American Dream, Satriani attempts to express his affinity with the Occupy Wall Street Movement.<br />JUMPIN' IN - Some southern gutter boogie mixedwith a fat back beat, then a new age-y transition, leading to some impressive funk bass by Chaney during the solo section...I really dig this, but perhaps not as much as I am blown away by:<br />JUMPIN' OUT - Colaiuta's half-time shuffle groove is golden on this track and the interplay between the musicians is testimony to the synergy that can occur when great players get together and allow their respective talents to shine.  The hip-hop groove during the breakdown is also a nice touch.<br />THE WEIGHT OF THE WORLD - A bit grandiose at moments, but I like the propulsive energy and especially get a kick out of Keneally's approximation of funk clavinet (ala Don Blackman, Andre Lewis, Stevie Wonder), percolating under a pompous progressive-rock sound.<br />A CELEBRATION - At moments this track recalls some of the grandeur of Eric Johnson's unique style, fusing seemingly disparate elements such as the country shuffle capably dispatched by Colaiuta and the trademark heavy metal proclivities of Satriani.  A fitting conclusion to a strong release packed with such a wide range of diversity.
0307596885|5.0|I've just finished reading Alice Munro's new collection of short stories \\"Dear Life\\" and am, once again, in awe of her prodigious skills in the short story genre.<br /><br />Already in writing this first sentence of my review/reflection, I inadvertently betray how much I have to learn from Munro. It's unlikely that she would use an adjective like \\"prodigious,\\" at least not in one of her compellingly spare stories. Munro writes with a stylistic asceticism that eschews almost all adornment. \\"Eschews\\" is also an improbable word to appear in a Munro piece. (Fortunately, since I didn't have Munro looking over my shoulder as I wrote my novel \\"Searching for Gilead,\\" I had the benefit of skilled editors to pare away superfluous descriptors by which I am all too easily seduced.)<br /><br />Let me open \\"Dear Life\\" and select a page at random. Scanning through the roughly 375-word text on this particular page, I find a total of two adjectives (\\"easy\\" and \\"disgusting\\") and three adverbs (\\"actually,\\" \\"exactly,\\" and \\"primarily.\\")<br /><br />I have two reactions to the lack of literary adornment in Munro's short stories. On the one hand, her capacity to fashion a gripping narrative with the bare minimum of vocabulary is genius. Picturesque canvasses are drawn, the intimacies of characters' inner lives are laid bare, and engaging plot scenarios are unrolled with prosaic everyday language. Reading the selections in \\"Dear Life,\\" I was never bored or distracted. Munro captured me and carried me along from beginning to end.<br /><br />On the other hand, I miss savoring the beautifully poetic descriptions that are typical of other eminent fiction writers. I love luxuriating in the rich prose of a Jane Urquhart, Hilary Mantel, David Mitchell, Esi Edujyan, or Allan Hollinghurst, let alone the classics of a Marcel Proust or Charles Dickens or Jane Austen. I'm thrilled by the writings of those who can draw from the teaming resource bank of languages to create powerful narratives that enthrall me and elegant descriptions that take my breath away.<br /><br />With that (not inconsequential) caveat, let me return to celebrate one other aspect of Alice Munro's writing. In \\"Dear Life,\\" which may possibly be the final book that is published by this Canadian literary giant, Munro demonstrates once again her capacity to create a wide variety of credible and internally consistent voices.  Within a paragraph or two of the beginning of each new story, the reader has a clear sense of the narrator or visual of the protagonist. And each voice, in each story, is unique.<br /><br />Almost. The last four stories in \\"Dear Life\\" have autobiographical elements. As Munro says of these four, \\"I believe they are the first and last--and the closest--things I have to say about my own life.\\" They are absolute gems and are all focused around the life of a young girl, presumably the same young girl who is, apparently, Alice Munro. My favourite, if I were forced to choose, is \\"Voices\\" in which a pre-pubescent girl is witness from a very great distance to the traumatic reverberations of war. The subtlety of the story is awesome--we readers discern what is going through the child's narration while the girl herself is left perplexed by what she is seeing and hearing.<br /><br />My novel \\"Searching for Gilead\\" went through five drafts based on feedback that I received from friends whose judgment I valued and two editors who were sympathetic yet ruthless in their advice. The published book is immeasurably improved from the initial versions largely as a result of a protracted exorcising of unnecessary and distracting verbiage (I know--I hear you readers, writers and editors decrying the redundancy of the phrase \\"unnecessary and distracting verbiage.\\")  I am now at work on a new writing project--a collection of inter-related short stories with the working title \\"Booktales.\\" Hopefully, having read and learned from Alice Munro's \\"Dear Life,\\" I am further ahead than when I started work on \\"Searching for Gilead.\\"<br /><br />* * *<br />For more information on Alice Munro's \\"Dear Life\\", see: [...]<br /><br />For information on my novel \\"Searching for Gilead\\" and my memoir \\"August Farewell\\", see my website at [...]Searching for Gilead.\\"<br /><br />* * *<br />For more information on Alice Munro's \\"Dear Life\\", see: [...]<br /><br />For information on my novel \\"Searching for Gilead\\" and my memoir \\"August Farewell\\", see my website at [...]

His wife would have been able to detail his distractedness from the day-to-day demands of family life in their home in Ireland.<br /><br />None of that technical or domestic information would give us much of a clue about how Mitchell conceived of a 19th century notary by the name of Adam Ewing writing a journal in the Pacific that gets discovered in 1931 by a frustrated composer Robert Frobisher working in Belgium who writes letters to his friend (and apparent lover) Rufus Sixsmith who becomes involved in a 1975 case of corruption involving a California nuclear power plant which is investigated by journalist Luisa Rey and then turned into a novel that falls into the hands in the early 21st century of a British publisher Timothy Cavendish imprisoned against his will in an eccentric nursing home a movie of which is watched by Somni~451 a futuristic clone rebelling against her totalitarian state which itself becomes the subject of a holographic projection viewed by primitive tribesman Zachry in a far off post-apocalyptic future which turns out to be the apex of the novel that then rewinds chronologically revisiting and picking up the story from where it left off earlier involving Somni~451, Timothy Cavendish, Luisa Rey, Rufus Sixsmith, Robert Frobisher, and Adam Ewing.<br /><br />Are you still with me?<br /><br />David Mitchell's imagination somehow came up with this gargantuan story line and then committed it to prose that ranges from lyrically beautiful phrasing to ancient and futuristic dialects that, I presume, are at least in part of Mitchell's creation.<br /><br />I'm in awe of the miracle of the imagination, not just the exemplary case-in-point of David Mitchell's, but of all creative artists.<br /><br />I've had some first-hand experience watching the imagination at work and am as confounded by the process close-up as I am when appreciating the product of someone else's mind.<br /><br />I've recently written a memoir \\"August Farewell\\" and a novel \\"Searching for Gilead.\\" The memoir is based on my life with and the death of my long-term gay partner and hence is biographical.

B004ADF7RO|5.0|After all these years, nothing has dethroned this &#34;king of the coming-of-age movies.&#34; The message is still universal and the story is still easy to relate to even though it's set in the 1980s. And, if you grew up in the 80s, you'll love the nostalgia and seeing a quite a few actors before they were big.
0061692034|5.0|As my partner Bill lay in bed in our home dying of pancreatic cancer, he told me that there was one message that he wanted me to say to his family members and friends during his funeral service: \\"Tell them to be kind to one another.\\"<br /><br />I was reminded of this as I read the final page in Richard Ford's recent novel \\"Canada.\\"<br /><br />It's not that Bill's words and those that Ford has his narrator speak were conveying the same message. Rather, it is that deceptively simple injunctions to others or observations on life or reflections about human nature can carry a wallop far out of proportion to their seeming innocuousness.<br /><br />Richard Ford has a capacity to communicate profound philosophical insights through casual comments that his characters drop in mostly unselfconscious moments. \\"Canada\\" is teeming with them as my highlighting pen gives witness. A few examples drawn randomly:<br />- \\"... it's the edging closer to the point of no return that's fascinating...\\"<br />- \\"It's been my habit of mind, over the years, to understand that every situation in which human beings are involved can be turned on it's head...knowing this, however, has not made me cynical. Cynical means believing that good isn't possible; and I know for a fact that good is.\\"<br />- \\"...if anyone's mission in the world was to gain experience, it might be necessary, as I'd already thought, to become someone different--even if I didn't know who.\\"<br />- \\"Which may finally be the only real difference between one place on the earth and another: how you feel about the people, and the difference it makes to you to think that way.\\"<br />- \\"What I know is, you have a better chance in life--of surviving it--if you tolerate loss well.\\"<br /><br />Grouped together like this might give a sense that Ford's \\"Canada\\" is a ponderous read and yet such personally philosophical and, one might say, existential reflections never obstruct the quietly paced narration of the story. I read the novel more slowly than I read most fiction, in part because I was relishing Ford's writing, and in part because I was trying to ferret out how Ford is able to convey so much of the internal mindscape of his narrator without succumbing to the tedious descriptions of \\"I'm-feeling-this-now\\" and \\"now-I'm-feeling-that\\" which make much contemporary fiction boring.<br /><br />I think that I've come up with a few clues. Ford is so skilled in character depiction that he is able to create a credible narrator who can share details of his own thoughts and feelings without coming off as either exhibitionistic or self-absorbed. Secondly, the philosophical reflections emerge organically from the story line. And thirdly, the narrator's observations strike us as simultaneously novel and familiar--we are jarred by the uniqueness of the insight but then immediately recognize how they resonate with our own perceptions of the world around us and within us.<br /><br />Which is, after all, why so many of us drawn to reading and writing fiction--to help others and ourselves draw meaning out of the life that we experience and witness.

B00BIRRDZ4|2.0|I don't know, but this Dawes album just doesn't cut it for me. A couple of the tracks are decent enough, but there's two main things that ruin it for me.<br /><br />1. The Production - The style on the first two albums fit together with the songs perfectly. Laid back, a slight twinge of rock here and there, with the main focus being on the songs. This...I can't put my finger on it, but the production just takes away from the songs. At times it seems too \\"big\\" and slightly slick.<br /><br />2. The Lyrics - The beauty of \\"North Hills\\" (and a decent chunk of \\"Nothing is Wrong\\") was that there was simplicity in the lyrics. On \\"Stories Don't End\\", it feels like the lyrics are too busy. When I first heard the track \\"From a Window Seat\\", it felt hard to follow because it sounded like there were so many lyrics crammed in there.<br /><br />And Taylor Goldsmith, if you read this, try this for a writing exercise...write something with NO similes in it. I'm a big fan of your stuff, but it seems that every time I turn around, some person or situation is \\"like\\" something.

193700788X|1.0|As someone who genuinely liked the world and (most of) the characters created, I was both sad to see it end and excited to read this new one. I will state that that past few books I got the distinct feeling that the author was bored with her own work which never makes for good writing but I kept going... maybe having a light at the end of the tunnel would rekindle her passion for the characters that got me involved to begin with, right? Oh so wrong... this last book was terrible. Everyone was back at square one intelligence. And it's like the author had a list of character names from the past 12 books next to her while writing and was determined to throw every single one of them into at least one \\"scene\\" no matter how little sense it made. Let me assure you, most of them made NONE. The writing was basic and boring, I found myself skipping whole paragraphs after the first 200+ pages I was worried to miss something and realizing I actually wasn't going to miss anything important. On to the specifics, if you still insist on reading this yourself (please, please don't waste your time or money) and don't want to know, don't read on...<br /><br />SPOILER -<br /><br />As someone said, Sam had been firmly set in a boss/friend/platonic place. Suddenly there's all this touching and confusion and they end up having pillow talk where Sookie admits she secretly wanted them to hook up? Um, I'm sorry, I understand that the author should know the characters best but 12 books of reading disagree with EVERYTHING about this story line. And as another said, she basically destroyed Sookie's entire relationship with Eric, which took books and books of building and development and emotion, in a matter of a couple pages. Three and a half meetings and a text message if I recall is what it took to end something just to set up her being single for the last hundred pages to sleep with Sam. It was disgusting how little effort and emotion was put into this... if the author could have put Eric ina spaceship and shot him to the moon to get rid of him, she probably would have. It was a bull-- move that made no sense.<br /><br />Every character had some kind of disgrace like this despite not as grand an \\"injustice.\\" Alcide shows up for two seconds to get naked and sniff around. Quinn pops back up for barbeque and a nice walk just to disappear to prep for Eric's wedding. Glassport.. what the hell was with his involvement? He got into this whole convoluted plot to kill Sookie just because he likes to hurt women? At least Newlin had SOME motivation.. But oh my gods was Harris scrapping the bottom of the barrel for ideas. Claude popping back up with no explanation how he got through a sealed portal and some weird hypnotic voice power to make men want to have sex with each other? What? (Not meant in a homophobic way but seriously, where'd that come from?)<br /><br />There were just so many problems with this book I couldn't list them all. Back-tracking plots, contradictions, personality changes or just no personality at all for some characters.. it was a waste of 400 pages and $15 or whatever I paid on iBooks. My advice... just don't do it. Make up an ending in your own head. Write it down in a fanfiction forum. Something else. Anything else.<br /><br />And if vampire-ism was a metaphor for gay struggle, with Sookie taking all this hatred for being in an 'unconventional relationship,' the ending says it fails and stick with the easy and the safe. If there was supposed to be a deeper message here, it did not go the way it should have where at least the vampire and the human stayed together and overcame diversity. Whether you like Eric with Sookie or not.<br /><br />Ugh. I could keep going but I won't, it's clear this series may have started as a fun fantasy but became nothing but a money grab as she drew out what many wanted, got bored, and just ended it however she wanted without regard for logic just to get it over with.

B0050DIWFC|4.0|Defending Jacob by William Landay is well written and has an unexpected ending.  The reader will learn a good deal about how Grand and Petit juries work.  If one enjoys legal thrillers, this is a very good book.

B0045NXMJE|4.0|A ragtag group of junk dealers helps their newest member discredit the arms manufacturers that caused his father's death and the super bullet lodged in his own head.  The plots and schemes they conjure up show flawless comic timing.  A lot of planning, joy, and creativity went into this.  Who says the French are morose and humorless?  Well, not all of them are anyway.  Good times.
B0006OBPTA|4.0|You get the movies which are all good to excellent.<br />A really nice feature is that they come in a small but easy to use DVD case which doesn't take up a lot of room.
B004N868DS|5.0|I went through several mousepads including the ones from steelseries before going with this one and it is far superior. I use this with my roccat kone xtd and they work perfect together (as should be expected). The build quality of this pad definitely seems solid and felt like I definitely got what I paid for.
B00AQSN7HE|5.0|Daniel Craig has captured the essence of the Bond character to a degree that few of his predecessors in the role attained. Bless the writers for recreating what I consider the essence of Bond: gritty, stubborn, single-minded and driven. The film is both gripping and should be great fun for all Bond fans. The modicum of romance in this film is more central to the plot rather than gratuitous or 'obligatory'.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I enjoyed reading this book. it was hard to put down. Filled with lots of action and suspense. I can't wait to read Catching Fire.

B009NY43NY|2.0|I gave 2 stars ONLY because the author at least made an attempt to conclude the series.  But what a sad half hearted attempt is was.<br /><br />I've been a Sookie fan from the beginning and have loved or loved to hate all of the wonderful characters but it seems Ms. Harris managed to totally divorce herself from not only this story but all of the ones that came before.  Many others have gone into the details so I will spare you.<br /><br />I would have rather been left in limbo than to have been subjected to this joke of a conclusion.  It is a shame Harris had so little respect for the world she created and so little respect for her faithful readers.<br /><br />I write this review not to discourage others, if you've been fan I will assume you will read it for the same reasons I read it, I write this review as a direct response to the author.<br /><br />Ms. Harris, I am completely disappointed.  This is the last book authored by you that I will purchase.

B007XU0N1G|5.0|So, this is my 1st review ever. Thought I'd give a little history first. After exploring the entire Rhapsody of Fire discography, they have become one of my favorite bands ever, some of their best works being Power of the Dragonflame( or pretty much anything from The Emerald Sword Saga ) and Frozen Tears of Angels, IMO ( although all of their albums are amazing ). Been listening to them for a few years now and there are very few bands out there than match the epicness and virtuosity of RoF. A bit fanboyish, I'll admit but anyways, moving on. I'll admit I was a bit nervous when I heard Luca left to form his own version of the band, now known as Luca Turilli's Rhapsody. Seen as a fresh new start for Luca Turilli so he can fufull his musical visions, he most certainly delivers here, delivering some of his best work to date. I've given this album a few spins already and am loving it, and now that I've had some time to let it settle in, I'd put it on the same level as the albums I mentioned above.  So how would I describe this album? Well if you're at all familiar with RoF, then you already know what to expect. You've got the neoclassical melodic guitar solos and speedy riffs by Luca, as he delivers some of his best work to date. You've got the latin choirs and the big orchestral sounds, so it doesn't stray too far from the typical Rhapsody sound. But there are a few twists throughout the album, there are a few new things, like some electronic sounds throughout the album and as heard on Quantum X, almost sounds like techno. And on the song Dante's Inferno, there's a part that sounds kind of alien. I cant quite explain it, but it sounds space-y. The beginning of Clash of the Titans has some police sirens at the beginning. Overall it's the same Rhapsody, with a few new tricks. Also, the narration returns on this album, and it sounds like the narration to a movie trailer or something like that( of course this is coming from Luca's passion for cinematic scores) but thankfully he struck a good balance with it and kept to a minimum. My biggest worry was who could Luca find to sing for the band. Fabio Lione ( vocalist in RoF ) is one of the best vocalists in power metal, so those are some big shoes to fill. Thankfully, Luca hired Alessandro Conti and he is a damn good vocalist, plain and simple. His vocal style fits like a glove. He reminds me a lot of Fabio and can hit those high, soaring vocals no problem. As for the songs themselves, they are really good. Rather than explain each song, I'll just say they mostly fall into fast tempo songs with lots of solos with a few slower songs in between. I found myself listening to the whole album from start to finish and just getting lost in the music. If I had to pick the absolute best songs, I'd have to say Excalibur, Tormento E Passione, Dark Fate of Atlantis ( a fast and heavy song ), their cover of Helloween's March of Time, and the 16-minute epic, Of Michael the Archangel and Lucifer's Fall. Really, the whole album is fantastic, but if I had to pick one weak link, it's the song Luna. Not necessarily a bad song, but it seems a bit out of place having a pop-ish ballad in the middle of the maelstrom of fast solos and speedy riffs. It doesnt stand out like the rest of the songs on here. Other than that, this is an excellent album and it'll be in rotation for a long time. Can't wait to see what Luca will come up for the next one and to see what RoF will come up with, the bar has been set pretty high. Check out some of those songs and if you like them, you should pick this album up, these guys really deserve the support. If your into symphonic power metal/ progressive metal, definitely pick this one up. I give this one an excellent 9/10, or 4.5 stars.
B0011ZVVOM|4.0|This album is very bluesy - it has a gritty, kinda muddy feel to it.<br />If you like bluesy stuff, there's a chance you'll like this.<br />If you not, this probably isn't for you.
193700788X|1.0|I have heard the complaints about the last few books but have always stood up for Ms. Harris and her books, but this one was complete crap! There was very little satisfaction in reading this book and it is a terrible conclusion for the fans that have followed this series for a many years.  It is increasingly clear how little Ms. Harris cares about her characters or her fans.<br /><br />DO NOT BUY!
B00BPEWNZU|3.0|This album is a let down from what I was hoping for. This record lacks the attitude and soul that Pressure and Time had. Also, the mix of the drums is not good - the kick drum is flabby and washed out and it affects how you hear the rest of the music. I realize they are trying to do some new things, which is good, but they lost something in the transition. Granted, I just got the record and these are my first impressions - but first impressions are usually reliable.  I knew the first time I heard Pressure and Time it was special - this is not.
1449437524|4.0|This was literally just a book with the online comic (seen here) [...] but in color. There's no added content or anything, its literally just that comic...in color. Not at all what I was expecting, but if thats what you want, that's what it is
B0085TKAW6|5.0|I loved it, great historical, geographical and all the other interesting things about a great tale................Lou.  I reccomend you read it.

B004S9AK3G|5.0|I loved this book and the one it followed.  If only they had taught history like this in school.  Maybe somone should suggest school children read it for history with a twist of fictional characters......very enjoyable.............Lou
B002XBVQKW|5.0|This has to be in the top of alltime musicals! It has catchy tunes and fun characters. The plant looks so real at times given this was done such along time ago!<br />A must have for all!!!

B001F12J0C|5.0|I bought this as a gift to my boyfriend. He loved it! All three movies come in a case so you don't have to worry about misplacing any of them.
B00BEZTMFY|4.0|I was anxious to obtain &#34;The Hobbit&#34; and was happy to see it arrive quickly and in good order.  A very good movie but maybe not at the same level as the Lord of the Rings trilogy.  Of course this is only Part One of Two and I believe the second one will be even better than the first.  The bonus disc is definitely worth the price as you get behind the scenes of the making of The Hobbit in a video blog format.  I enjoyed it very much but maybe not as much as the bonus features of the LOTR DVDs.  A must have in your collection if you are a fan even though it doesn't hit the level of the LOTR trilogy.

B009NY43NY|1.0|I can't believe how CH has disappointed her fans.  I've read all the books in this series, and invested a lot of my money and time for nothing.  What a way to repay us Ms Harris. I could go into all the things that are wrong with the ending to our beloved story, but why bother.  The only thing I enjoyed about DEA was clicking the return button.

B009NY43NY|1.0|I am so disappointed in the final installment of this series.  Horrendous writing with a lackluster plot this book did not tie up the series.  Full of contradictions from previous books, I felt it should not have even been published. Unfortunately Charlaine's writing became worse with each book.  Maybe if she had condensed the books and left out so many pages of mundane tasks such as \\"sitting, trying to check email\\", \\"cleaning out drawers, and closets\\", \\"eating this type of food\\", \\"here is my shift at Merlot's\\", \\"here is how I went to bed last night\\", and \\"here is what I wore\\" it may have helped the series.  Also, the investment in character's from a readers standpoint and then to drastically change their personalities/roles in one book after building them up over a series was too much for me.  Such a disappointment.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|i recommend this for everyone.  i love this game.  if you dont have it get it.<br />one of my experiences was when i jumped over the tunnel.
B000UVT3OI|3.0|I was very disappointed to learn that all the songs do not have titles.  They are just listed as track 01 etc.  So, if you want to record on to your MP3 you would just record over each cd.  I thought when I put them in my computer maybe I could change the name to the name of the song but that does not work.  The music sounds good but I would never buy one of these albums on line again.  Unfortunately I just purchased five cd albums.
B008JFUUIA|5.0|It is very much like the singing version of step-up and Bring It On, but I liked this movie a lot more than either of those.  It's funny and the music is great!

B0017SWPXY|5.0|There was a lot I could relate to in this book from many directions. I drive track so the things discussed from a racing aspect were all my language. Denny's respect for the family as to his racing, and so much more I don't want to spoil for anyone reading. I've had several dogs that looked at me like they wanted to talk to have a discussion. What a great perspective on life.
B00CL0J99K|5.0|This is by far the best IRON MAN yet!<br /><br />There wasn't a single dull moment.  Compared to the Avengers, which left me in lull for quite a few moments.  I stayed entertained with Stark's antics throughout.  There is a little something for everyone.<br /><br />The exciting part was that some of this movie was filmed in Kenansville, NC.<br /><br />Can't wait for the Blue Ray!
B004TJ1H3C|1.0|SGU: Stargate Universe - The Complete Final Season tried so hard to be something but ended up being less than nothing.  Wooden acting would be an amazing upgrade for this series. The characters are all pretty one demensional cry babies.  Everything in the ship is black except the people.  The reason you watch a DVD is to see something hopefully something good.  You see nothing in most of SGU: Stargate Universe - The Complete Final Season because; most of the scenes are so badly lit.  I mean most TV shows at least do a good job lighting the actors faces but not here. The special effects were nothing truly special.  The Stargate in this show was more a fifth wheel rather than important part of the show.  The writing was tepid and often boring.  Even the so called fast paced action scenes were boring.  Watching SGU: Stargate Universe - The Complete Final Season was about as exciting as whiching the bubbles pop in a collection of spit.<br /><br />Then there was the sex scenes there was just too much bad sex in SGU: Stargate Universe - The Complete Final Season.  I mean if you are going to have sex scenes they should be about two people who really mean something to each other.  During the sex scenes it is obvious all the characters are just going through the motions.  The people in SGU: Stargate Universe - The Complete Final Season  are mostly young folks who seem to think acting is too much of a chore so they can just skate through the script coasting on their looks.  It is as if someone cast a bunch of mid-level fashion magazine models in a Stargate franchise, the director says ok people \\"Act!\\"  I watched the Starlost from beginning to end and it was full of cheap sets, bad writing and horrible effects.  I'd take watching Starlost over this crap anytime.  This reminds me more of the updated sexpot soap opera version of Battlestar Gallatica only done far worse.<br /><br />I saw Stargate in the title and immediately figured hey I'll give SGU: Stargate Universe - The Complete Final Season a chance big mistake.  I have a vast DVD library on the order of 25,000 DVD's.  When I croak I'd love come back just to see the fight over who gets the DVD collection.  That said SGU: Stargate Universe - The Complete Final Season is not likely going to be in my collection.  I love collecting bad movies especially sci fi because; bad sci-fi is often still very good or at least very funny. SGU: Stargate Universe - The Complete Final Season is neither good or funny.  SGU: Stargate Universe - The Complete Final Season is not watchable because it is so dark you can hardly see the actors.  Use of the Stargate is just a running joke. Stargate Atlantis was good but SGU: Stargate Universe - The Complete Final Season is just a waste of money. I only wish I could give SGU: Stargate Universe - The Complete Final Season the negative five stars it so richly deserves!lete Final Season a chance big mistake.

B00BMKDTNC|5.0|So glad it was finally made available for E-Readers!! While not everything was wrapped up as neatly as I would've liked, part of the magic of the high fantasy genre is your imagination. Mr. Sanderson did a great job with including things RJ wanted in, but doing it in his own style. BS has done many interviews on AMoL, so if you need clarification on some things, you can probably find it by reading through those. He has said that he won't be writing any side stories, or furthering the epilogue, which is really disappointing, but understandable.
B00B2V66VS|1.0|Since January people have been requesting that this game be debugged. It is now MAY and there are still problems. It works a few times then kicks me out. It is fun and I would give it  5 stars but not until the problems are fixed.
193700788X|1.0|My fellow readers - thank you for your honest and candid reviews of DEA.  I was on the fence about actually purchasing and reading this one.  (Book 12 was horrid.)  I can now put this $15 to better use.  I feel really sorry for those who actually purchased this one - ick.  At least we won't have to worry about any more horrid titles and/or series from Ms. Harris.  I for one will be waiting for the next J.R. Ward series...
B0091REZMW|5.0|so addictive. this game is truly wonderful. a little overwhelming at first but overall great. I love the different levels but am unsure why all the women look like prostitutes
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Great show! A lot of twist and kept me on the edge of my seat. Can't wait til next season.
B00BNYCFNM|4.0|It is hard to imagine that Big Big Train could pull off a \\"Part 2\\" album as good as \\"Part 1\\" but they managed to do it. Part 2 is as good as Part 1. I will not say better because nothing new is really on display on here. Personally, I like the fact that their creative awareness extended to continuing some of the musical themes from Part 1 over to Part 2. This gives the entire English Electric project a true sense of cohesiveness. To not do this would make the naming convention somewhat pointless.<br /><br />I do not have much more to be added from my review of Part 1 so I will not ramble on hear. Just suffice to say that if you enjoyed Part 1 there is no reason not to purchase Part 2. If you have not purchased either, then you will in no way go wrong in purchasing both and having probably two of the best progressive albums for 2012 and 2013. Big Big Train is rapidly becoming one of the most consistently good progressive bands in England, possibly the world.

0061950726|5.0|During my Sunday morning commute to church, I had the good fortune to hear a wonderful interview on NPR Radio of author Christina Kline and the discussion of her new book, &#34;Orphan Train.&#34;  I was astonished that I had never heard this account of &#34;Orphan Trains&#34; as part of our nations history.  The story is based on the author's extensive research of train orphans that were unwanted children from east coast cities, especially New York City.  The &#34;Orphan Train&#34; operation began in 1854 until around 1929 during the Great Depression in relocating children to areas in the mid-west where they worked on farms, did child labor or did extensive work at foster homes caring for many children.  The story evolves around two orphans; one, Vivian Daly, an Irish immigrant and Molly Ayer. a Pentoscot Indian.  Both of these women spent difficult times in foster care and this author brings you closely into their lives.  You feel every struggle that they endure and every change in their lives.  This story will tug at your heart; while you may forget many other stories of fiction, you will always remember the children of the orphan train, especially Vivian and Molly.  When you reach the last page of &#34;Orphan Train,&#34; you will feel it has been an great reading experience. This is a story of fiction but reflects, in a similar manner, lives of unfortunate children.  This would be a great book for book discussion.  My only complaint was with the publisher's choice of very small font size and poor book binding quality.  This book is a literary treasure and it should have been published in a quality that it deserves. So the publisher gets a &#34;F&#34; and the author gets 5 stars.  Thank you Christina Baker Kline - a great read!
B005LAIHY0|2.0|Even though the special effects are cool, the story sucks! I thought It was going to take me to the next level but honestly ... I didn't like it.
B00AQ3K8IU|3.0|An interesting perspective from a 17- yr old girl, with all her ups and downs......has a few bumps and surprises along the way....the boyfriend was a saint, as in my experience, 18-19 boys only think of themselves...but a nice story, a little sad at times....overall a nice story. I am 46yrs old, and its refreshing to read something, that is about real life, and I love Sky's attitude in life...she battles on no matter how hard life throws things at her.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This book was amazing in every way! One can't help but fall in love with the main character Charlie and sympathize with the struggles he endures figuring out himself. The author has a unique way of telling this story in the form of letters that really makes the reader gain a clear picture of life as an adolescent boy struggling with identity.
B004ODLUGM|5.0|She has watched this so much I will need another one in the near future. Thank you so much for a great movie.

B0083Z614S|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book. It is well written and captures the imagination. This is a story that young and old alike would enjoy.
B008VBYN80|5.0|I was surprised that Kingdoms and lords was a free app once i started playing. There is of course a way to buy items with a credit card but the game is designed so it is not necessary to put real money on the line though. A helpful tip with this game is that you need a gameloft live account to open some of the features. You can just make up a username and never look at it again and gain access to some of the features. The gameplay is fun and if you are a fan of any other games you build a city or military base this app is for you!
B0083ZRAJS|5.0|It's a short, easy read, but it's very enjoyable. The entire series is a delight for people of all ages who enjoy the characters of Oz.
B00B8R1NP0|5.0|From the very start of this story I was held captive by the darkness and terror. Well-written and engrossing, Time Killer is frightening and gets you inside the sickness of serial killers. Imagine something, an event that is considered an everyday occurrence, being large enough in the mind of an individual to kill someone over. Then multiply that madness by 100. That will begin to describe, without giving anything away, the twisted mind of this book's villain. Add to the mix an ambitious, slightly sexist, detective on the move up through the ranks paired with a rookie female detective and you've got a pretty interesting gang of characters. Despite some mechanical dialogue and awkward point of view tense, I'd recommend this. If you like procedurals mixed with horror and solid writing, get this book.
B00B1OWEVC|5.0|Trent Reznors new project meets the expectations of his long term fans without sounding like Nine Inch Nails 2.0.  It's easy to tell that he is the composer but the two projects are distinct from one another beyond the obvious female vocals from his wife, Mariqueen Maandig.
B000C20VPA|4.0|This is the case I understand this movie is good, but I dislike it.<br />Call me strange, but I don't like showing Robert de Niro, the dangerous gangster, watching constantly the cleanliness of the floor as a housewife, and doing many task I think much more real that beatings or killings, but to become so high in the criminal ranking to finish in looking constantly the if  the glasses are clear and so on it's a sort of terrible damn for a man of action. Fighting the love of Sharon Stone against the stupid personage played superbly by James Woods is another curse.

1616614609|4.0|Android: Netrunner overall is a fun and diverse experience. Asymmetric play, racing to score agendas vs. burning your opponent, traps and timing attacks make this a welcome departure from the mass combat play style of Magic and other card games.<br /><br />However, the &#34;Living Card Game&#34; format does not really save players any money over the collectible card format in the long run. Type-A players will keep buying more and more expansion packs, effectively forcing casual players to keep up or lose out to more powerful cards and strategies. Also, both the core set and the data packs have a lot of spam cards. Net Shield, Bullfrog, and Snowflake? Waste of art talent, space, and money.

030758836X|1.0|I wanted to read this book as it has gotten so much hype.  The first half dragged and then I was encouraged as it picked up in the second half.  However, that was short lived as the story and characters just dissolved into unbelievable, uninteresting, hateful nonsense.  And I totally agree with others that the ending was just terrible.  Nick deserves Amy.  I will not read another book by this author.  I feel like I need a shower after reading this book.
B00C1ZYM56|4.0|I like the spin-off.<br />Gave it 4 stars because it was good. Parts 1 & 2. But it needs a heavy hitter in there somewhere.<br />I don't feel like I would put my life in there hands fully. I'm sorry but I feel there should be a male in there who knows his weapons. They all seem to make for good comic relief. Paris and Roy seem to  have some funky issues and time will only tell.<br /><br />I like the LA team the best.
B003UV8TFE|5.0|It is widely assumed that a good scientist is also good at teaching. At the same time the stereotypical scientist is reclusive and hidden behind piles of paper covered in chalk dust. Needless to say that all of these are completely unrelated - and along comes Walter Lewin.<br /><br />\\"For the Love of Physics\\" is not a book about everything you ever wanted to know nor a comprehensive review of our fundamental theories of the universe. It is an exhibition of raw curiosity that every one of us probably has felt at one or another point in our lives. It is that original spark which is at the core of a good scientist. The boldness to ask questions without the fear of not understanding the answer. Even better, the answers are beautifully simple once the relations are laid out (in principle). Here is the scientist who can't help himself but go out and let other people rediscover the world around them.<br /><br />\\"For the Love of Physics\\" is in part biography and in fact starts with a chapter on the author's childhood, although these parts never serve their own purpose. There may be short chalk board type excursions (no equations, though) but in the end everything always leads back to the basic motivation. Research happens in all our lives and whatever we do in research needs to be understandable (or maybe adorable) by everyone. That being said, this book is for everyone. If you ever felt that certain curiosity about nature and the universe, here is your guide to find it again. If not... find it for the first time.
193700788X|1.0|Don't buy this book it is a waste of money. I have to agree with other reviewers who gave this book a poor rating.
B0034DGPEU|1.0|This book was a waste of time. It was repetitious, filled with stereotyped characters and cliched writing. Read The Help instead.
B00BJ9VBLI|1.0|Playing and starting to really like this game I was thrilled it was free...  Until very quickly it got to a certain point in the game where you HAD to purchase the full version in order to go further.  This was a MAJOR disappointment in that there was no mention of this before I downloaded it, and I only did so because it was listed as free.  Sure wish Amazon would make a rule that this MUST be disclosed in the product descriptions!!  This is the only reason I gave 1 star, otherwise it would have been at least 4 or more.
B0053TMP24|5.0|THE BEST BOOK YET THANK YOU for writing this book and the series (both of them) because they are both awesome.
B0067TQQI8|5.0|The Anker 8400mAh is a great battery pack for charging your phone. I owe a Samsung Galaxy S3 and the battery pack can easily charge my phone 3-4 times. It is a good compromise between weight, size and power. I would strongly suggest this product to anyone who needs to have his/her phone always charged.
B003TSEL7S|5.0|Awesome book keep up the good books Rick Riordan this is best book yet thank you for writing the good books.
B007H1HQW0|4.0|Little bit of a learning curve, but after a few cuts I had it working good.  Allow a couple of extra bottles for &#34;testers&#34;.  I used WD40 as a lubricant and if worked good.  I will have a lot of fun with this!
B005S9EK5Y|4.0|similar to the play but the movie is clearly differnet and the voices of some are very strained or insufficinet
B004X6PRO6|3.0|I liked the book.  It is an interesting take on what it may be like to live in Korea from an American perspective.<br /><br />According to Johnson, when living under the North Korean System, the story is more important than reality, and when the story conflicts with reality, it is time for those living in reality to adapt to the story in order to survive.<br /><br />Most of the book is very interesting, but because of the reality vs propaganda story that is at the heart of the book, the book is nonlinear and sometimes confusing, just like the lives of those who must adapt to the story.<br /><br />Some of the examples of the official North Korean take on the story of life in North Korea are brilliant.  According to Adam's take on the propaganda speakers, in North Korea the generators shut down at night allowing the North Korean populace to enjoy deep and powerful dreams of work quotas and reunification, while (adjusting for time zones),  Americans dither away their indolent evenings with television and even religion.  For this reason, and many other similar reasons, eventually North Korea will triumph over those who have burned it to the ground.<br /><br />Adams' take on Korea is that it is bizarre and oppressive,  and it may well be; but his focus on the strange culture gives us little insight in to how that culture came about and where that culture is going.<br /><br />So I would recommend the book as an interesting read into life under oppression, but do not think the book provides any insights into how that oppression began or how it can be avoided.
B00B3HJMLM|5.0|This is just like the sunshine it reflects. Bouncy,catchy and a lot of fun. Some great songs and performances. Highly recommended.
0385349947|5.0|Enjoyed the book very much.  Good for Sheryl Sandberg writing this book and raising women and men's awareness of equity issues in the work place.  Yes, I know she has lots of money.  Still a good read.<br /><br />Carol M

B009JZWO3I|5.0|Season 4 builds on the previous seasons.....Knowing the characters makes the show more enjoyable.<br />I love the way opposing lawyers and judges with quirky personalities rotate through the episodes, and<br />the show addresses timely topics.<br />And of course the sexual atmosphere is always smoldering under the story line, and reappearing every once in a while..<br />The last scene of this season is highly manipulative, but still fun !
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|this game is really fun the only thing that I hare about it is that I have to download extra. space for it to work
B009KS4XRO|5.0|This is a Fun  and Great bingo game.  Sometimes I cant get enough of it!  You will have hours of fun.  It is well worth it.  I take it with me every where I go.  Good job Developers!
B009XY97VC|5.0|I love 21 of these 22 songs.  The only one I don't like much is #2 Titan Dream, only because the vocals somehow bother me.  However, the rest of the album is fantastic and amazing!  It's wonderful to like nearly every song on an album.  That is rare, unless it's a 'greatest hits' album.  I really like Two Steps From Hell, and I think this is the best album.  I didn't realize it was my son's favorite until after i had bought it and chosen every song but one to listen to!  I highly recommend this album.  I think you will love it too.
B008GFI4V8|5.0|Always loved Peter Jackson's telling of the story. It's got 2 discs for the ACTUAL movie because the movie is so long and since it is blu-ray, they didn't want to sacrifice the quality just to fit it on one disc. I am personally fine with the fact that it's on 2 discs. Then, there is a bonus features DVD disc that comes with most standard movies, and 2 really long and in-depth documentaries and behind-the-scenes DVD discs (I think one of the videos on the disc was 1hr 30min long, so bascially another movie you can watch) about this specific film, while Return of the King and the Fellowship of the Ring both have 2 discs of really extensive documentaries about their respective films.<br />All in all, wonderful for a collection and anyone who wanted more even after 3 and half hours of the original cut (this one is 40 mins longer!)
B003MOHX8S|5.0|I like 17 of these 22 songs.  Freedom Fighters, Heart of Courage, Master of Shadows, Moving Mountains, Enigmatic Soul, Fire Nation, Invincible, False King, Fill My Heart, Protectors of the Earth, Undying Love, !000 Ships of the Underworld, Tristan, Breath of Ran Gor, Infinite Legends, To Glory, After the Fall.  Definitely worth it to buy the whole album!
B004G8QHKO|5.0|I saw them in concert at the Santa Barbara bowl with Garbage last year. They were fantastic. Great cd. Definitely recommend.
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|I was a little doubtful about this game at first, but if quickly won me over.  I've always been a fan of dinosaurs, so the feeding and upgrading aspect of the game is fun.  Its taken a lot of time and patience but I've gotten up to level 30 and I plan on going until I get every dinosaur and every park expansion.  The buildings and decorations available for your park make for unlimited customization, build your park however you like.
B005PK553C|5.0|Very interesting show with great acting. Jessica Lange is incredible. It is scary at times and funny at other times.

1598595474|5.0|This is a must READ, OWN, and USE for everyone. This has helped me in all aspects of my life!
193700788X|1.0|Dont waste your money. I loved this book series and now one book ruins entire series. Awful awful book....what a shame. Eric was by far the best character in the series and you just toss him aside!
B000OLGCI4|5.0|Another one of my favorites, The jungle Book.  Loved it!  The movie was the first movie that my children went to the theatre to see!  Great!
B009KS4XRO|2.0|Love to play the game despite the laggy peak times but the customer support is one of the worst i've experienced. I could not get a response from them when I didn't receive $40 worth of credits i ordered and had to contact amazon for a refund. Buyer beware... if you have a problem... you are on your own (amazon support was great tho)!
0881036366|3.0|To be fair, I'm not EXACTLY sure what &#34;library binding&#34; means. That said, the copy I received doesn't seem to be particularly sturdy or well-made. It's a huge book, so I understand the difficulty, but I was a little disappointed.
B0016492BW|5.0|Ordered this yesterday when the price dropped to $9.99. Instabuy considering you also get the Ultraviolet copy as well! Chose 3-5 day standard shipping and it was at my door this afternoon. Love this movie ... My 5 year old is starting to like it too!
B004GHNIRK|1.0|Don't hate the book,  just have not yet had the time to read any of it. Don't know when I will get to it.
1589795474|5.0|I would highly recommend this book to any person who has ever received or spent money!<br /><br />This book is without a doubt one of the best personal finance books I have ever read.  In fact, I have read this book several times.<br /><br />This is NOT a fluffy, motivational book that claims to 'change your life'.<br /><br />It does NOT portray any 'get rich quick' methods.<br /><br />It gives the FACTS on what it takes to be successful and accumulate wealth (based on tons of research and common sense).<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br />-Prodigious Accumulator of Wealth (PAW)
193700788X|1.0|I will never ever buy another book written by Charlaine Harris! What a waste of time and money invested in this series!! Seriously CH, this is the ending we get??? A steak through Eric's heart would have made more sense!
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|No strings...just free! I downloaded this file to my Kindle. I was able to create a quality level document with awesome editing for free. A great little app.
B0065GC0PG|5.0|Wow, what a story! Yep its a retell of the good ol faithful Cinderilla, but this one packs a real punch. Not only is Cinder a page turning adventure, its a thriller with many levels of plot. DON'T turn to the back of the book, because you will still not get the whole thing until you have read all of it.[[ASIN:B0065GC0PG The Lunar Chronicles: Cinder]]
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|One of the best books i've read in years! For anyone who plays and loves video games, this is a great book.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is a very fun game to play I like it and I know a lot of people who play this game
193700788X|1.0|I can't go into to this now other than to say... what a waste. After 12 books? Really? I was holding out hope for something redeemable. What was all that garbage about \\"the essential spark\\" for? Sookie can now have her telepathy removed? What???<br /><br />DO NOT spend your money on this book.
B009P13RQY|5.0|If you're a fan of The Sword, then purchasing this album is a must. Check out 'Dying Earth' and 'Apocryphon,' especially.
B0044DEAUA|5.0|I order this product for my Sony Xperia TL Phone, easy to used and the bluetooth is compatible to my phone. This is my first time using this product.
0553386794|5.0|My sister is totally hooked on this series thanks to this copy that I bought her for Christmas.  She's purchased the rest since then from this same seller I believe.
B002ZG997C|5.0|Greatest movie ever, tons of fun acting wwas just great , I watched this movie over and over again its 5 stars
0375869026|5.0|I LOVE LOVE LOVE this book and was pleasantly surprised to see how quickly I was able to get another copy and in as good of shape as it was.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Amazing graphics and an even better story. If the hidden object games become too difficult or tedious they have another option which I like.
B009NY43NY|5.0|I Enjoyed this book so much. Without giving anything away, if you have read all the books in The Sookie Series, you will love to see some of the series most loved and hated characters.  There is no way for Ms. Charlaine to give everyone their own personal wants as a ending, it's Sookie's ending and I loved it all, trials, tribulations, heartbreak, the laughs the tears the loves and the loves lost. I am very pleased at where we leave the Sookieverse.
B003ODIZL6|5.0|It is absurd that i have to submit a review before i close the book and with a precise number of words
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love playing it a lot.I love playing that sort of thing.What a lot for a free game.Thank you very munch.
B00CDT41RY|1.0|This movie was not good at all, I'm not sure why everyone thinks it is so awesome.  It is extremely gruesome, and the story gets lost in the constant gross brains being blown out everywhere like an exploding watermelon, or banged out with a hammer, etc,  and in between showing people being tortured.  It should have been more about the story, and less about the blood and guts. It was a waste of my time.
B00AZL3PBK|4.0|The first thing I thought of when I began playing this game was Super Mario Brothers. How fun. Easy to play. Can become addictive. Good app. Colorful. Like the graphics.
B000FC11A6|5.0|Loved it....great weave between WWII and present.  Funny, thoughtful, and informative on history of computers and crypto.  End is more satisfying than others Stephenson has written.
1616550414|5.0|I'm a huge Zelda fan so after finding out that this was coming out in English I was excited and it delivered! The book is filled with about 200 pages of unseen artwork, top that off with concept art from all the games, a timeline explaining how each game works within Hyrule's History and Skyward Sword bonus manga in the back makes this an awesome book! My only thing I have that I don't like is that there are a few (3 last I counted) misprints and errors in the timeline (example on page 89 being that Darunia giving you the Spirit Medallion, he doesn't, Nabooru does yet in the book it says she give you the Fire Medallion) but besides that I say it's a great buy. If you not into The Legend of Zelda at all then after reading this review please look into it, you'll like it and pass if you're not a fan. If you are it's one of the best books out there!
B001BC5HXG|5.0|ONE OF THE BEST BOOKS I'VE EVER READ. IT TELLS ABOUT THE HUMAN CONDITION. I WOULD RECOMMEND IT TO ANY ONE FROM A MATURE TEENAGER TO AN EIGHTY YEAR OLD LIKE ME.
B00BD2DRHW|4.0|This game is wonderful. Adults and children  both  seem  to  like. it.  My  great  gradson  did  a better job  than  I  did.
B00CI5ET7K|5.0|This album is amazing from beginning to end. It's title says it all. The album is in overdrive the whole way through. I love the song called \\"Three sheets to the wind\\". It's funny and groovy. I can say there is a lot of keyboard in this album but not as much as \\"Engines of Creation\\". The final track \\"Celebration\\" is classic Satch. I haven't skipped one song and this is my second time listening so far. I highly recommend this album.
B000YJ85BI|3.0|Not a great ending to a good series. The books in the trilogy became progressively less interesting. The fist book was fantastic followed by good and then this one was just ok. I was really annoyed with the writing style.  In particular the overuse of every sentence ending with: He said or she said or someone else said. Really!!!?  Could have been better.<br /><br />The plot was interesting but really drawn out.<br />The backdrop was like a painting that lacked any color. It was there but not described in much detail.<br />Dialog is used to carry the story along in 90% of the book.<br /><br />What did I like?  The obin are fun. The conclave is interesting as is its leader's high sense of morales. The CU proves to be almost incompetent and flawed. Something their scientific abilities suggest is impossible yet there it is in the book. I really enjoyed that twist.<br /><br />Is it worth a read?  Yes!
B001ANSSDC|5.0|I thought this book was way better than the movie . The book has a better story line and shows more of the ups and downs of a bipolar person . Also the book decribes Philadelphia the way it really is and that is a plus !!
B0041C1ZXE|5.0|Really liked some of the songs on this album right away, but wasn't a big fan of about half of the songs at first. My friend encouraged me to listen to it a couple more times, and claimed that the songs get better with every listen. I listened to the album a few more times, and fell in love with most of the songs.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game rocks!!  You can build things that will amaze even you!!!  But dont get me wrong. This game should be like .99. The game would be even better if it was .99. I still LOVE it, but it is WAY too expensive!
B00AO686MY|5.0|I am so glad Disney finally released this movie on BluRay.  It's great to see again after all these years.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love subwaysurfers XOXOXOXOXOXOXOXOXOXOXO XOXOXOXOXOXOXOXOXOXOXO<br />IT IS AMAZINGLY AWESOME AND THE REST OF THIS WORLD SHOULD BE ABLE<br />TO PLAY THIS GAME[[ASIN:B009UX2YAC Subway Surfers (Kindle Tablet Edition)]]
B001M2CBRK|1.0|This one is just plain terrible.  Absolutely, positively terrible.  A complete failure on every imaginable level.  First off, this is a war movie without a war.  There is no combat in the entire film!  None!  Not one single shot is fired against an enemy throughout this entire turkey of a film!  Instead, we are forced to sit through the meanderings of a bunch of comic-book Marines as they sit about and do absolutely nothing for the vast majority of the film.  The protagonist (Gyllenhall)is trained to be a Marine Scout-Sniper, but he spends almost the entire film as a rifleman in an infantry squad.  He is presented as some sort of unfathomable oddball who is supposed to be tough yet intellectual; caring yet a trained killer who is \\"addicted to it.\\"  His performance is that of a poorly conceived caricature of a tough Marine/psychopath/deeply conflicted good guy, and he manages to pull of not one bit of it convincingly.  He is not the only one, though. The acting throughout is atrocious - no one would mistake any of the artificially \\"complex\\" characters for a real Marine.  To be honest, the film is a vile insult to the many brave men and women who have served and are serving in the United States Marine Corps.  But the failures of this film so not stop there (would that they did!).  The screenplay is utterly pathetic.  Note to the hack who wrote this thing: you never write a story about a meaningless day in your character's life.  This entire film is a chronicle of the most meaningless days in the protagonist's life.  The viewer is left not caring one bit about any of the characters.  It is almost enough to make you root for Saddam Hussein.  If the film accomplishes anything, it is to convince the audience that Operation Desert Storm was a nothing more than a completely one-sided air war in which the troops on the ground served no purpose whatsoever.  The film's greatest success is in convincing the audience not to watch it in the first place.  Cardboard characters, nota trace of realism, a war film with absolutely no combat and less action than a typical romantic comedy.  This one should have been thrown into a shredder before it was ever inflicted on the viewing public.  Absolute garbage, pure and simple.  Don't waste your time or money on this zero-star looser.  Without a doubt, one of the worst - if not the worst - war films ever made.
B00BSBT8M6|5.0|Wonderful and engaging film; the best I've seen all year. Special effects are amazing. Great acting, directing, and an unforgettable story. I was sorry I hadn't read the book first, but will surely read it now.
1451695195|5.0|I chose this rating because I really enjoyed Dr. Alexander's book.  I knew his father from work and appreciated him very much and I'm happy to learn that his son has personally experienced Proof of Heaven.  It is great that some physicians are experiencing what so many of their patients have.
0307346617|4.0|I'll admit; the first time I read this book, I didn't get what all the fuss was about. But I was bored one day and decided to pick it up and read it again. I'm thankful I did. This book is amazing, not because it tells the tale of Zombies, but it tells the tale of humanity. It tells how humans pushed to one foot off the cliff of existence came back from it changed. Better.<br /><br />Now, if you're picking up this book to read cause the movie is coming out in June and come to love the book as much as the rest of us, you'll have to realize that the movie is NOT the book. Not even close. If you want to experience this book in it's true form, go old school and download the unabridged audiobook. In the abridged version, every character is acted out to perfection, I'm not expecting any less when the new unabridged version is released.
193700788X|1.0|If you want a series that leads you on for a great character development and twisting plots for the first 10 books, and then lets you down and blows up in your face for the last three books, this is the series for you. I am left wondering how the series took such a downward spiral, and I can only say it angered me enough to write my first review to save other people the time and money. This final installment was especially pathetic, the writing was poor and unimaginative and the characters were unrecognizable. By the end, I hated all of  the main characters... especially Sookie. I can't believe I defended the books as being better than the TV show (which the earlier books were indeed better)... but now I have to say that even the train wreck that Alan Ball left the True Blood writers in is still better than this pathetic excuse for a story.
B0085W09ME|1.0|I did not find this app useful while looking for flights, so I deleted it. You may, but it's not as powerful as Orbitz.com.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|Great from beginning to the end! Nice characters and lovely plot. You can tell from the start there was love in both their hearts.
B00BB67UNW|3.0|When I finished watching BROKEN CITY, I thought \\"Hmmm...not too bad \\" especially since I'm not a big fan of Russell Crowe.  It held my interest and moved at a reasonable pace.  Mark Wahlberg and Catherine Zeta Jones did well and the supporting cast were effective in smaller supporting roles.<br />However, the day after I found myself thinking \\"It's really not that good...\\"  Some of the plot seems contrived, much of Crowe's dialogue is muddled and hard to understand, and the movie's big twist leaves a bitter taste.<br />I'll give it three stars because I've seen much worse.
B00571F26Y|5.0|This was actually a pretty quick informative read. He does a nice job at making all the science more palatable. He even invokes some humor making all the information easier to digest. I saw the author as a guest on the Dr Oz show and was intrigued and decided to get the book. I am so glad I did! This book really resonates with me and I am giving myself a 2 week wheat and grain free challenge. I started the challenge on 5-6-13, I plan on reporting  back my experiences in two weeks for all that are interested.
B005IQZB14|4.0|The almost perfect summer read.  Parts get a little bogged down with the personal demons, but the books holds your attention and delivers a better than expected ending.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|This app works perfectly for Facebook.  I don't always have connectability when out and about, but if you have opened your app before leaving home, it will store quite a bit that you can open without a connection later.
B002O6FBW0|4.0|I think this recreation of the original classic deserves a lot of consideration for its meticulously perfect digital restoration of the original backgrounds and sets. The music is excellent and hauntingly obscure and perfectly suited. The costumes, makeup and photography are perfectly rendered to add this remake of the original macabre story beautifully. I am still sort of torn about the way the actors approached this. In one way it seems to be stylized acting that fits the subject matter in a rather soap opera-ish style. Sometimes it works perfectly, and other moments seem too ordinarily current american personality wise. The acting is more in line with that of a stage play, but its actually pretty good over all. I have to say this production is a notable and gallant effort that pays memorable honor to the original. Im not sure why some members here didnt get the gist of this. Considering the obstacles faced by the director, crew and actors on how to make this film effective and what they had to deal with to pull it off so well is practically an extraordinary achievement. I enjoyed this very much and think its a marvelous homage and labor of love.
B009ME47H2|5.0|I use this to record meetings, or just quick thoughts in the car to remember later.  Works very well.  2 thumbs up.
B00000K0DQ|5.0|I remember when sister Helen Prejean came to Stockton, where I live, in the late 90s to talk about her experiences with death row inmate Matthew Poncelet. She spoke at an auditorium just 3 blocks from where I lived at the time. I missed her appearance because I had a flu with a 104 temperature and remember regretting not being able to attend the lecture. It would have been truly interesting and I am sure also life affirming to listen to her experiences in those dark days back then. But Tim Robbins film is a powerfully moving experience that tells a very painful but gloriously touching recounting of what happened during those depressing, dark and freightening days she spent with Poncelet on death row. An average woman of faith who cared enough to take an interest in a man who commited terrible crimes. She her self had never been involved in something so hopelessly dark and painful, but she was used in a wonderful way to help bring peace to the convicted killer and the families who suffered the loss of loved ones at his hands. Sean Pean and Susan Sarrandon give astonishing heartfelt performances that are rarely seen in cinema. Especially Penn who clearly was so deeply over-taken by this character that it must have been deeply emotionally draining experience to go through. The end result is a truly memorable film that becomes more and more intense and dramatic as it goes. This is one of the 10 best films of the entire decade of the 90s. Well worth seeing.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Very interesting and entertaining.  Appropriate for teens and adults. Make sure you read before watching the movies!  Certainly worth buying.
B001AH6ZWY|5.0|\\"If it's just us it seems like an awful big waste of space\\". How true. Here were are in the midst of billions of planets, stars and galaxies. Its so vast and amazing it boggles the human mind. Planet earth is a spec of dust within it all, yet we humans are so pompous we actually find it difficut to believe there is other life out there. But not Ellie(Jodie Foster). She had the faith to believe in such possibilites, and by sticking with her hope she discovers the greatest breakthrough in human history, and was then left to stand aside while goverment scrutiny and red tape made their own decisions and not for the best. In the end Ellie gets her chance to visit another world, and as the audience we get to experience a magical spectacle rarely seen in cinema. Contact represents one of the finest science fiction experiences that can be imagined. This is a solid motion picture masterpiece that I have personally seen several times and it takes my breath away just a little more with each viewing. This film often rises above the masterful sci-fi achievements of Kubricks 2001: A space oddesssey some 30 years later. Indeed a cinematic experience rarely achieved to this degree. Jodie Foster once again proves what a truly talented actress she really is. Along for the experience are some gifted actors like Tom Skerrit, James woods, Mathew McConaughey, and even Bill Clinton signed on to play him self in this truly epic motion picture. There is a sub story here that is truly interesting also. Should someone who doesnt believe in the existance of God be allowed to travel 20,000,000 light years into space to make contact with an alien existance? Though I believe in god, I dont think its an issue at all. This is truly a spectacular and powerful movie experience that represents the best in science fiction story telling. Highly recommended!
B008MG1E4A|4.0|I don't read very much and I knocked this out in a couple days, great read!
B005EJNAK4|5.0|I gotta say, I'm getting really tired of reading bad member reviews for movies I almost pass on, then watch and am suprised how good they are. Based on the bad reviews I almost passed on this one. Two many people out there reviewing films here that don't know what the hell they are doing and their taste seems to be in the toilet. I am beside my self why so many people didnt like this movie. I loved it. Judging from numerous member reviews here I thought this was going to be practically a dud. I found the exact opposite to be the case. This film was excellent. I felt the entire story was one of the better Sci-Fi ideas someone has come up with in a long time. It was filled with lots of action, well crafted special effects and an ingenious plot. Other films that were critically praised recently from the Sci-Fi world like District 9, which in my opinion wasnt as good as this movie was, simply were not as original or as interesting. Is it that my taste in film is really vastly different than that of so many others? The entire film was engrossing, exciting, unique and well done. This is one of the most original science fiction films I have seen in nearly 20 years. I liked it more than Disctrict 9 for certain. Liked it more than Minority Report. Like it more than A.I. Hell I liked it more than the last two Terminator films as well. This is right up there with the best sci-fi ever made as far as I am concerned. I found it an entertaining thought too that Bruce Willis looks a helluva lot better without the youthful appearance of his surrogate with that pile of blonde hair it had. I bet knowing that someone out there thinks he improves with age like a fine wine would at the very least put a smile of Bruces face. I really loved this film. Its the best sci-fi film I have seen in a long long time. I consider it a classic!
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This book was extremely real and amazing. The tears which flowed from my eyes weren't even as real and the story. Breathtakingly amazing.
B0036SUQWA|1.0|Just off the top I want to say this is a review of the reviews, of the title, and of the trailers. Firstly I saw several different trailers for the film. I thought to my self \\"Ok I can tell this movie is going to really suck. The title alone is enough to keep me from going to see it\\". I mean how good can a movie that comes from a title like 'The Men who stare at goats' be? The trailers looked extremely stupid and there wasn't one second of any trailer for this film that grabbed my interest what so ever. I was thinking that maybe the film was way better than the trailers or something, because the trailer looks so inept and stupid that it's less appealing than the title of the film which is the stupidest movie title I have heard of in my entire life. Based on user reviews here which are about 70% 1 or 2 star reviews urging people about how bad this film was. it leaves me wondering why anyone would want to go see it. The title alone told me that the chances were this movie was going to bomb, and it did. Glad I didn't see it.
B00AJAFNIA|5.0|This has defintiely been my favorite FAOD in a long time. Different, cute, really fun for all ages, challenging to master but easy to play. I defintitely would have paid for it, but i may not have heard of it if it had not been offered as the FAOD. Definitely worth the money. I anticipate that this game will be very popular.
B000KW6HN2|5.0|The people vs Larry Flint is a very important film for many reasons. And it is just as important for those with moral conviction as it is for those who have have literally no moral or godly conviction. For the usual christian they may see the film as a statement that equates the wages of sin amounting to utter ruin. For there is a point that can be made that to the conservatives Larry Flints life was one of literal implosion. Living with no limits or control leads a slippery slop to demise. To the christian this film is an example that drives home the common statement The wages of sin is death. In the case of Flint death follows through excess, drug use, loss of control and mental deterioration. Indeed most of us wouldnt want to trade places with Flint no matter how much money was involved. His life indeed was a tragic one. To some however Flint is seen as something of a hero. A voice for free speech and a free america. Flint in reality was a man with clearly no moral convictions at all, be it spiritual or secular. Without some conviction to rule your life in one form or another total misdirection and demise follow. This film in my opinion never judges the religious order or the heathen one. It masterfully stands by as an observer and simply tells the story as it really happened. Leaving each individual to decide which side in this debate they would really want to be part of. In the midst of this are three incredible performances by Woody Harrelson, Cortney Love, and Edward Norton. The film is often hysterically funny then sadly heartbreaking, and sometimes even operatic in its creativity.
0061743526|5.0|I was very pleased with my purchase. The picture matched what I received. Books were in great condition. I would buy again.
B0035XVVDY|2.0|This has to be one of the most rediculous films I have ever seen. The film was actually entertaining in an odd way, but the entire plot is so over the top its just plain silly to say the least. What happens in this film is so far fetched that there is no way it could ever happen in reality, in the real world. What the character Gerard Butler plays accomplishes is so impossible that the slickest and most professional government agents on the planet could never pull it off. No one has the capability to excercise the kind of power and control that Butlers character seems to have in this film. To add insult to injury some of the acting in this was rather pathetic. Butler was really weak in this role, as were numerous other actors. This entire film had me thinking constantly things like Good lord, give me a break or Gawd how silly. There however is plenty of action, and if you can find it within your self to suspend any sense of reality you might actually enjoy the dumb premise to the film. I did in some odd way even though I kept thinking how stupid the whole affair really was. If your the sort of person that needs to feel the plot is at least even remotely plausable I would avoid this film as you would the idea of coming down with the flu. Horrid idea for a film, yet sometimes it was kind of interesting.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Can't wait to begin book 2! Fast reading. Couldn't put it down from the time I started reading. Very entertaining. Would recommend.
034580404X|5.0|I have been looking forward to reading these books and they were brand new in the box which I didn't expect!! I can't wait to read them all and order more from Amazon!!!
B0060MYM3S|5.0|If you haven't read the books, you will probably need to watch this more than once.  Just watch it again for the fun of it!
0060531053|5.0|I liked the detail in the book. It would turn a novice into a professional brewer. Look forward to the companion volume.
B00BJ9VBLI|4.0|Like the game just think that once you have completed the game that you should be able to play on.  Didn't like that i had to buy the full version.  The next one that issue coming out we should  get it for free.
B001GMQALY|1.0|I would describe this as a bunch of random soft porn scenes strung together without any meaningful plot. Kim Basinger and Mickey Rourke give possibly the worst performances of their lives. Completely disappointing on all levels.
B003O86FMW|4.0|Not what I was expecting but the twist ending makes me want more  I can't wait to read book 3
B005IXSN4E|5.0|1) If you have never listened to this album (who hasn't?!) - Just buy it, don't listen to any of the tracks until it arrives. Unpack, turn up your volume, and sit on the porch with a beer. This is one of those albums where the tracks just keep getting better. Do yourself a favour and buy it!.<br /><br />2) If you have heard it - Why don't you own it already?
B004W2UBYW|4.0|If you own or ever hope to own a business you should read this book. If you are ever curious about why Apple grew to be so large, so good, so unique and able to change the way we live, you should read this book! Or, if you just want a better understanding of why Steve Jobs was such a &#34;one of a kind&#34; leader, read this book.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|my daughter really enjoys this game...she loves how the horse looks and that she can groom it and feed it treats. training it is fun for her too.
B004WGIXX4|4.0|I thought this was a cute movie.  Of course it is one of those that you can kinda guess how it ends.  Would recommend!
B0089Q1TPM|5.0|This is Mel Brooks at his best. Great characters, good acting, a movie that is fun to watch and doesn't take itself too seriously.Lots of memorable lines and moments. Even my grandkids love it.
0425263908|1.0|Copy cat so boring same story line same old sex scenes just different names I wish I would have not bought these
B00371QQ2U|5.0|Having just received a Blu-ray player, I tried this film out. I didn't see much difference between it and my other DVD, but it was still a crisp, clear picture. The film is so uplifting, showing how everything worked out when people stopped panicking and &#34;worked the problem.&#34; Refusing to accept failure as an option, the head of the mission kept everyone focused on a higher principle, and Jim Lovell also set a good example with the crew in space.
0425263916|1.0|Its like I dont know which came first - this or Shades. Dumb and dumber its just almost word for word - same story line, same goofy repeat sex scenes
B00BSWMITK|5.0|It's amazing how Joe just keeps getting better with age. This album is just fantastic from start to finish. I love Jeff Campitelli and Stu Hamm, but Joe put a monster of a rythm section together for this one! Vinnie Colaiuta and Chris Chaney tear it up throughout this whole album. And Mike Keneally...what can I say? If you are a fan of instrumental music or a musician you will love Unstoppable Momentum. Enjoy!
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|Love this game-addicted!  Cannot stop playing this game.  glad I got this game on my phone through Amazon.  So fun!
B0019N8P2W|5.0|yep the monotone girl and her iffy world going to iffy places with iffy friends. but the entirety is great to have.
0399230033|2.0|The condition of this book was very poor in my opinion. I also didn't think I had ordered a small board book. Very disappointed.
B0031RAOVY|5.0|This movie arrived as estimated and was quite touching.  It ran perfectly.  The video tells the tale of the connection and loyalty between a man and his dog.
B009HEJXFS|5.0|What can I say? I am a sucker for the MIB concept! If it were real and I got wind of it, I would join the organization right away, no hesitation. And this franchise keeps getting better.
B000ZN802W|4.0|This video arrived in plenty of time for my purposes and was priced right for my budget.  It ran perfectly for me as well.  It is a story of a young man who wanted to survive without the trappings of a financially sensitive society.
B009X01D9U|3.0|The case is very well padded and I liked  that you had more than one choice of angles to stand it up. That said, it is fairly heavy and I wish it had included an inside pocket and a loop for a stylus. Also turning it vertically is not a very smooth action.
080701429X|5.0|Delivered on its title.  Made me have to stop and reflect on many occasions.  Will be suggesting this to friends and family.
B00A0MJA1I|5.0|This is a wonderful Disney movie. I bought this for my grand daughters, and the two disc combo is perfect. My daughter puts the regular disc out in her car for the kids to watch on the DVD player there, and the Blu-Ray disc stays in the house.
B0001CNRSE|2.0|it was scratched and it didn't come in a case....I only got to watch it once! it was awful! I love that movie it was unfortunate that is was scratched!
B005LAIHXQ|5.0|This movie finally connected the Alien films.  I have watched it at least 10 times before buying it.  It would be great if Ridley Scott would to do a sequel to this one showing Shaw going to their planet.  The special effects are wonderful.  I love this film!
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Can't wait for the third book to come out. I love this series. I like it better than 50 Shades series.
193700788X|1.0|I'm so happy I didn't buy this went to the bookstore to read it after everything everyone was say online. I'm so happy I didn't waste my money this book it was a mess from beginning to end & the fact that it ended this way makes me wish I had never started reading in the first place. Well at least I still have the show & maybe it will have a better ending than the book did.
B006M7JCC2|5.0|I have a fascination with hearing near death experiences and this one was truly amazing with such a great message to us all! The beginning was a little slow for me because i wanted to get to her near death experience but it was setting it up so you could understand her background which in the end made the message even that much better, knowing how she was raised and such. Worth buying and could potentially be life changing by incorporating her message of being your true self and living fearlessly!
B003G4W49C|5.0|Now before I begin I want to tell you that this might be the most mind racing book ever all I wanted to do is read read read unroll I finished the book this is the story of Andrew Wiggen Speaker for the dead
B007SGLZP8|3.0|For the past few years Grisham's lawyer books seem to have lost their ability to engage. This one is no different. A fun enough read, but as with the past few, I was never drawn in by the characters or the story line. Perhaps this one was a little too contrived.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Such a great book!! Read both (1st 2) in two days. Could not put them down! Anxiously waiting for the third!! Great job Sylvia!
B003LSU0K8|4.0|Nice watch, not heavy, right size, easy to put on. I bought as a gift, and was excelent idea. Excelent for sports. ,
B0086700CM|4.0|This game if fun if your bored. Its a challenging and fun game. You should buy it..if you haven't already
B000IZ8SD8|5.0|Hands down the best of the Next Gen movies, and the transfer to Bluray is amazing. The video and sound quality are fantastic.
B003LQMZS0|5.0|It's a cute toy and my daughter likes it, but it wasnt super amusing to her. Maybe she is just hard to entertain, but it's still cute. she did like the little mock mirror so she could look at herself.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|I really enjoyed this book from the very first page. I love that it was told in first person from Pat's perspective; that way the reader isn't privy to information that he doesn't want to reveal or can not and/or doesn't wish to remember. I haven't seen the movie yet; I'm anxious to watch it, although I'm sure it can't compare to the novel. Ive never heard of this author, but now I'd like to see what else he's witten. A lot of people complain about choppy style, but if it seems choppy, it's only because Pat's thought process is choppy...a reality for someone who's suffered a mental breakdown.
1594487154|5.0|A great book from Pink. This book covers two topics. First is the premise that everyone is in sells. Pink defines sales as the process of \\"moving others.\\" Second is an overview of the new world of sales and how we can all increase our natural ability to motivate others.
193700788X|1.0|I can't believe how disappointed I am in this book.  Since May 2012 I have been looking forward with trepidation and excitement for this book. Trepidation because I knew it was the last but excitement because I thought (based on the previous 12 books) I knew whom Sookie would end up with.  I wish I could be &#34;glamoured&#34; just to erase this novel from my brain.  Whatever happened to Eric being the only on who 'got' Sookie? These novels are in the realm of fantasy - you mean there was no better way to end it like this? It ruined my enjoyment of this series.
B0042RJWTC|1.0|The series was good.  However, the later disks were scratched and as a result the show skipped at points or out right stopped.  It was too late to return the product by the time I got to the later episodes.
B009MYARIK|5.0|i loved this book! There were many times I laughed out loud which is a big plus.  I almost didn't buy this book after reading some of the reviews so let me assure readers who like Kinsella's writing, they will love this book too
B0042TV4IW|5.0|The characters feel like family and friends.  The countryside is beautiful and I feel like I have returned to family and friends with each new episode.
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|Good series. It is a long read but where Robert Jordan started Brandon Sanderson did a good job of completing it. You can see the swap over but only just barely
B00C2VGAW2|5.0|The soundtrack to the Great Gatsby movie sounds modern for the most part, unlike the movie which is set in the twenties. Like Luhrmann soundtracks of the past (\\"Romeo & Juliet\\" or \\"Moulin Rouge\\"), contemporary songs and covers are used to enhance the movie experience, and in some strange way it works.<br /><br />Laden with a plethora of multi genre stars (Jack White, Jay-Z, Beyonc&eacute;, The XX, to mention a few), the album opens with the Hip Hop \\"100$ Bill\\" by Jay-Z, followed by a dramatic almost Trip Hop reworking of Amy Winehouse's \\"Back To Black\\" by Andre 3000 (who sings) and Beyonc&eacute;.<br /><br />\\"Bang Bang\\" by will.i.am is one of a few songs that attempt to fit into the period, a big band horn-laden Ragtime dance track which surprisingly works. Other similar tracks are \\"A Little Party Never Killed Nobody\\" by Fergie, Q-Tip and GoonRock, and a swinging jazzy reworking of Beyonc&eacute;'s \\"Crazy In Love\\" by Emile Sand&eacute; and The Bryan Ferry Orchestra.<br /><br />Lana Del Rey's \\"Young And Beautiful\\" is a beautiful atmospheric ballad. Other ballads are \\"over The Love\\" by Florence And The Machine, and the piano-driven \\"Kill And Run' by Sia. \\"Love Is The Drug\\" is a Jazz/Blues reworking by Bryan Ferry And The Bryan Ferry Orchestra. \\"Together\\" is a moody downtempo electronic number by The XX, as is \\"Into The Past\\" by Nero. \\"Hearts A Mess\\" by Gotye is atmospheric and indie, while Jack White dramatically reworks U2's \\"Love Is Blindness\\" and it works.<br /><br />Great!
B00AF6MF9I|4.0|This game is fun and addictive.  I can't stop playing.<br />  It will have you coming back every day to test your strategic skills against others.  I highly recommend it to everyone.
B00BEZTMQ8|5.0|This movie was the bomb in the theatre and is a bomb on DVD. I only buy DVDs to watch the movie. I don't buy them to check out the extras, UNLESS there are bloopers. That's it. Good DVD.
B0063IH60K|4.0|Good way to spend time .good way to exercise your brain.  like classic Windows game.<br />Don't need anyone else to play
B001EYU1VO|3.0|When set up for BF3 game, it's really touchy and I usually crash. Take some time and practice and adjust you're settings, and you'll probably kick my butt for sure!
B0086449YA|5.0|The songs in this collection are a fitting addition to all the albums I have of Mark's.  The tunes are varied in style, but all have the signature sound with a sort of familiarity that makes them new favorites immediately.  So glad to add these tunes to my current rotation.  Just get it.
B005P4PAVK|5.0|This show is of course a show about Penny, I have heard others claim there are other members of the cast in the show , one can only assume they are hidden easter eggs on the DVD version.<br />I love Penny.
B008JGSM6G|3.0|Not too bad of a time waster.  Fun but not one you can't put down. Overall happy  with it since it was free.
B000055Y0X|5.0|a  great movie classic, a great cast of characters, easy to watch over and over! lots  of dark humor and great cast.
B00BWLKTOS|5.0|If this is your first introduction to The Piano Guys, this is not a review of the album per se, but a brief explanation letting you know that the review has been broken up into the individual songs. First of all, almost every Piano Guys song has a music video with it. This Deluxe Edition of the album has a DVD with all the music videos for the songs on the album. (Author's note: The DVD does NOT contain the video for 'Berlin'. The video must not have been finished when the album went out to stores...) If you are interested in any of the songs on this or their first album, go to their Youtube channel and check out the videos. If you like them, come back and buy the album. I have written a review for almost all The Piano Guys' songs, so click on my user name (http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1BIBNY8ID4MWE/ref=cm_pdp_rev_all?ie=UTF8&sort_by=MostRecentReview) or search for the song you're looking for and read the reviews. (Every song on this album has been reviewed).<br />These guys are awesome people, song writers, performers, etc...<br />They're awesome. Their music is awesome. Their videos are awesome. Buy the album. You won't be disappointed. :-)
1423140605|5.0|My daughter loved this book and all of them in the Heroes of Olympus series. She is just mad that it takes a year before the next one comes out. If your kids like the series check out Rick Riordan's Kingdom Keeper series they are the same type of book but are based around Disney
B0090CVJZ4|4.0|The product look and works well with one minor issue. When using 14 gauge wire it would pull out. I had to remove the red and black identifying rings to make them secure. I did not have a larger gauge wire to try them with.

B009R659L8|5.0|Another page turner from Mary Higgins Clark.  I could put it down, an absolute great read to start the summer reading season.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|the game is ok but it really is just a week version of Mario brothers, still fun but only middle of the road fun
B005IQZB14|5.0|Wonderful read about the many struggles of Cheryl Strayed, and how she finds herself on the PCT. Perfect read. Inspirational.
193700788X|1.0|******************SPOILER ALERT**************************<br />I have been a fan of this series since book 1. I am a fan who bought the newest book the day it came out and took the day off to read it through. I say this as a preface to what comes next. There are so many things that are wrong with this last book, starting with continuity failures. The author reverses herself on so many things she wrote previously;a last minute \\"fix\\" for Sookie's telepahty problem when she firmly established in earlier books (see conversations with Niall & Mr Catiliades) that it couldn't be taken away. She has Sookie tell Sam she can't hear his thoughts, only his emotions. Yet in previous books she heard him, as well as those of Quinn and Alcide. (This as a way to make it easier for her to be with Sam I suppose). Sam has been firmly ensconced in the \\"best friend/boss/almost older brother\\" role for most of the series and suddenly that changes. There is no build up in the books for this change,since it apparently is at least partially due to the Cluviel Dor she used to save him. And there is another huge continuity issue. Sookie hated the blood bond because she feared that it caused her to love Eric, yet she is fine with the possibility that the CD is effecting how she feels about Sam. And once again we have a fairy (Claude) back, it seems the idea of those portals being closed is more of a thought than a fact. The cruelest thing though I think is the way Eric's character was portrayed. While I confess I loved the romance between him and Sookie, I always thought that the author was not going to leave them together at the end. She has been quoted too many times as being actually confused why the fans of this series like Eric so much. But there could have been a gracious way to end their relationship rather than the gut wrenching painful way it was done. And I will mention in passing that the author has been given credit for making the vampires in the SVM world be a metaphor for the gay community (Vampires \\"came out of\\" of the coffin). Butthe message from DEA is clearly, it's too difficult to deal with this world, better to go back to what you know and feel safe with. I could go on and on. One positive comment, I do want to thank Charlaine Harris for creating the SVM world and the wonderful characters she populated it with. I just wish that in the end she had cared about them as much as her readers do.
B009MCRHH6|4.0|It's fun and I like that it gets increasingly harder to figure out.  I could play the day away with this game.
B00BTYP6QE|5.0|i own all of the cut the rope games and when i saw it i got it you wont be disappointed its a great game that makes you think about physics and patterns i enjoy it and so will you
078689136X|5.0|Great fun as police procedural tale.  Pulls in the reader quickly.  Complements the TV &#34;Castle&#34; series very well.  Have fun!
B002BWP49C|5.0|I loved the movie and always love the special additions on the DVDs on these. If you like the Twilight series you'll probably love this movie.
B002VKB0M4|3.0|It was ok nothing special was looking for my scenery of Paris and there was very little.<br />The subtitles reading what was being said was sometimes annoying.
B008XG1X18|5.0|If you want to lose yourself for hours in mindless fun pintrest is for you from recipes to fingernails it's awesome
B008602KQI|5.0|Really Great movie! Some parts are sad but it as great moments! Must see movie and if you wanna read the books it's alright too.
B00CL68QVQ|5.0|This was one of the best movies I have seen in a long time. The reason why it was so good? Because it was people ACTING and doing an amazing job at it. Not a whole bunch of crazy CGI and explosions to take away from an actor's lack of talent. Great casting in this movie. Bradley Cooper and Jennifer Lawrence play what it's like to suffer a loss combined with previous mental illness and how it feels to have lived the worst moment in your life, and have everyone around you see you as a crazy, broken outcast. This is an amazing movie for anyone who has gone through what these two characters have because it makes you feel human, not broken. Thank God, Hollywood and the rest of society are starting to accept mental illness as an ILLNESS and not something to be ashamed of.
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|What a lovely surprise.  Started very slowly.  However,the characters grew so beautifully and the storyline built to a perfect crescendo.
3836503050|5.0|As a graphic designer/illustrator and pin up lover, this book is a great collection of Gil's works nicely organized. Great reference material.
B00BGDF1FO|5.0|I just had to get this after I played through Metal Gear Rising because the music was just stuck in my head for days afterward.
B006LSZECO|4.0|I began the book taking days reading the first part, then finishing the book in just one day! Couldn't put it down!
B002SSUQFG|5.0|Wonderful and high price ratio, You will get what you pay for. I may want to have a second one!
B00A14SQBU|4.0|I purchased this mp3 album on one of the deals amazon had going on. it was cheap so why not. I really like Christina Aguilera a lot, but for some reason this album didn't catch my attention as much. it is a okay album and I still love Christina and her talent!
B0041KKYEM|2.0|I know I disagree with many people about  this film. But I have spent a major part of my life with the great dancers from the Bolshoi, Kirov, ABT, NYC; indeed, I have lived with two different Prima Ballerinas Assoluto. I know real dance, real use of arms, real charisma in ballet — and Miss Portman's efforts were simply dead, uninspired, almost pre-catatonic. If this is because the artists think they are merging an essentially schizophrenic heroine with a dual persona ballet role, they miss the mark on every opportunity.<br /><br />Remember how Garbo pulled off a great ballerina in &#34;Grand Hotel&#34;? That is what is missing from this strange, badly choreographed and for me badly filmed effort.

0439023521|5.0|In the future, North American has become the nation of Panem, ruled by the Capitol and separated into 12 districts. Past rebellion has caused the Capitol to become extreme in their methods of keeping the districts under control. To keep the districts in check, the Capitol instills fear in the districts by holding an annual \\"Hunger Games.\\" In these games, one boy and one girl from each district (called \\"tributes\\") are sent to an arena where they must fight to the death. To make it worse, these events are broadcast on live TV.<br /><br />Katniss Everdeen, who lives in district 12, is her family's provider because she breaks the rules and goes hunting. She is fiercely protective of her sister, Prim, so when Prim's name is called as a Hunger Games participant, Katniss volunteers to take her place. Katniss is immediately taken to the Capitol in preparation for the Hunger Games, along with the other 23 tributes. Will Katniss survive the Games?<br /><br />If you work with young adults or are a fan of young adult literature, this book is practically required reading. I'd heard wonderful things about it, but I didn't pick it up until recently. It kept me up late at night because I couldn't. put. it. down. It is action-packed and you never know what will happen next. I thought that Collins developed the characters well, and I was really rooting for Katniss throughout the whole book. There was even a little element of romance in this book, despite the grim circumstances the characters find themselves in. If you want an exciting blend of adventure, romance, and suspense, read this book. To be honest, I was afraid the violence in this book would be a huge turnoff, but I was so engrossed in the story that they violence didn't ruin it for me.<br /><br />The ending was a big surprise to me, and I couldn't wait to find out what happened to the characters next.  Luckily, this is the first book of a trilogy! I'm warning you - only pick up this book if you have time to finish it quickly. You will not want to put it down! Same goes for Catching Fire.
B00A3OT34M|4.0|This is a Awesome album to dance to, with a great beat! There are a lot of additional artists on this album. overall, I was happy with the album
B002PQ7JQK|5.0|I couldn't afford this set years ago but with Amazon's discounted pricing, I finally could.  If you are a Star Trek Fan, this set is perfect for you.
B004S3MB2U|4.0|not much to review except that its a calculator with a bit more than an average one. I really never use it but for some basic math.
B001TH16DI|5.0|I have VCR tapes of these movies and the picture quality on Blue Ray is unbelievable.  The VCR tapes have probably turned to dust by now.
B002X3V4P2|5.0|I love enya and her beautiful voice! this has the very best of her songs and then some. Glad I purchased this!
B007TBZ63Y|3.0|Good book loved it a lot it rekindled my love for Rick Riordan a little lovey dovey but the same old cliff hanging action packed adventure filled chapters that captivated me and many readers alike in the previous lightning thief series and the first two hero's of Olympus.definitely worth it to buy and read and I can't wait till the next book
0345529057|5.0|About the content...<br /><br />If you're more like Data than Lore, more like Spock than Kirk, you'll might appreciate that George R. R. Martin's A Song of Ice and Fire makes perfect sense.<br /><br />Sure, there's a bit of the supernatural (ok, there's a whole bunch) but all the swords and war and sex and politics are believable. Even the disconnect between seasons and years, even the 700-foot-high man-made wall of ice, even the baby dragons are believable.<br /><br />Plus, Martin doesn't waste endless words explaining his ancient alternative Earth... it just IS. This is a fantasy that even science fiction fans can love.<br /><br />Full disclosure: I'm reading Book 1 after having watched Seasons 1 and 2 of Game of Thrones on DVD and HBO.<br /><br />Yes, I admit, I haven't finished even the FIRST book, but there's no point in waiting to say this: the writing is wonderfully entertaining, better than the TV series in the sense that the books are longer and tell more of the story.<br /><br />The characters, Oh! the characters are fascinating, the twists and turns and suspense and adventure and dialog, this is clearly A Life's Work, this song of Mr. Martin's.<br /><br />I'm actually watching Season 3 while reading Book 1 and enjoying both. Sounds \\"Impossible!\\" doesn't it? Yes, but go ahead, buy this book, you'll see.<br /><br />About the books themselves...<br /><br />This review is about [[ASIN:0345529057 the set of 4 paperback books I purchased in April 2013 for U$19.78]]. That's five bucks a book, a fair price even though this set first came out in 2011.<br /><br />Don't forget, you're getting a total of 3,264 pages, plus this isn't exactly a candidate for the remainder table (think wildly popular TV series)... plus, it beats [[ASIN:B004JN1D2I the current Kindle price ($29.99)]] by a wide margin.<br /><br />I bought this 4-book set expecting to buy book 5 when I'm ready to read it, which might not be for a year. By that time, I'm hoping I can get it for five bucks aswell, but I'm not holding my breath... Season 3 of Game of Thrones is excellent.<br /><br />I'm tough on paperbacks, after I'm done with one you KNOW it's been read (possibly by an orangutan). This one is standing up as well as any.<br /><br />Yes, I have a Kindle, but it's one of the color versions that don't work too well in the bright Florida sun. Besides, I prefer paperbacks when they're available... ESPECIALLY when they're cheaper.
B00BKBCF38|4.0|Infestissumam for the most part is brilliant, the songwriting is top-notch, it's creative and has more hooks than a tackle box. And, while similar to their first release there are subtle differences, for starters some songs have a more epic feel to them, and the album as a whole is slightly lighter. It also sounds more accessible, but not intentionally, thankfully. And, they're branching out into new territory sounding less like their influences and more like \\"Ghost\\". There's also a fantastic cover of ABBA's \\"I'm a Marionette\\" - Obviously the band understands if you're going to cover someone, doing something different with the song is the way to go. HOWEVER ... The ONE downside to the album is the production, it sounds like the band is in another room with the door open, rather than sounding like being in the same room as you. You can have the finest ingredients in the world, but cook it wrong and it's bad news from there. Fortunately, the band is SO good, one could over look the production to a degree. On the first release, the rumbling bass is always present and clear, while on Infestissumam it gets lost (but still present) in the haze of guitars and drums.<br /><br />METAL
B0012TWRAO|4.0|I have one of these for every ATV, UTV, motorcycle and bicycle in the household.  Makes for a quick attachment/detachment for a GPS unit.  This product will be worth your hard earned money.

B007J4T2G8|3.0|Ok this book was good. Apart from the fact that this millionaire is perfect and handsome. She can't figure out that she likes him because she herself is shallow.maybe she doesn't like all the other  guys she's met because there not millionaire pilot pianist statue of David built giving grey eyed smart sexy men? Jesse girl get a grip.
0143116738|5.0|This book just explains what you already know.  It just brings it to the surface of your daily thinking.  It supports getting an education, but not necessarily a college degree, you don't need a college degree to be a massage therapist and make 70,000 a year.  but if that is what you are talented in, and enjoy it, DO IT!<br /><br />I wish it would come with a starter kit to figure out what you are naturally good at doing, like an aptitude test or something,<br /><br />Thanks!
B009MCRHH6|5.0|This is an awesome game. I love it so much. I my only problem is that I cant find a way to turn the sounds off. Worth the 5 bucks.
B00A757EFW|2.0|Was at first excited to see pacman available. But I ended up deleting from my phone becuase i was getting frustrated due to the slow response or no response to the control on my phone. Maybe its my phone. Download the LITE version first before buying it to try out.
B008CLI4N4|5.0|This is a very intriguing series!  The combination of good character development, multiple story lines, solid acting and good direction ensure this will be an interesting series for years to come.  I look forward to getting season 2!  As a deployed Soldier, working through Amazon to make on-line purchases is easy.  I am very satisfied with their customer service and speed of product delivery!  I highly recommend using Amazon to every Soldier.
6305428042|1.0|As far as shipping went, it arrived in a very timely fashion. Unfortunately, when it arrived the DVD had dislodged from its setting and was rattling around the case during shipping so it was scratched to high heaven & my DVD player could not read it. I was very excited about owning this DVD but it clearly wasn't meant to be. I'll order it again one day.
B0060MYM3S|5.0|The second season picks up where the first season left off.  Great characters and story lines.  Looking forward to season 3.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|Pretty good book, a little slow at times but picks up at the end. Would read another from this author before I can put him on the &#34;to read&#34; list
1451648537|5.0|Astonishing, breath-taking, mind-blowing story about the orphan who changed the world. I have to admit that this book was one of the thickest books I've ever read in my life. And in addition to that it was one of the most stunning book's I've ever read in my life.<br /><br />This book is biography of one of the most brilliant minds ever lived on earth. He is Steve Jobs. Everyone knows iPhone, iPad, iPod and many other devices created by Apple Inc. So in this book you can find all the life story of the man who played the main role in creating and developing those amazing technologies and the company itself. And this story isn't simple.<br /><br />I love this book because it's so involving and inspiring. I couldn't put it down since I first took it in my hands. Of course, I haven't read this book in one sip, but until I was finished I could think only about what's next. Another thing that fascinates me a lot, is that in this book there are a lot of dreams, struggles, challenges and victories. Jobs himself was a very difficult, but interesting personality. Some people hate him, some love, some do both, but there is none who don't have any of these feelings for him. His vision was huge, his dreams were unrealistic. Despite all of that, he made everything to make them come true.<br /><br />I greatly encourage you to read this book. If you have big dreams, huge visions, wish to succeed - Steve Jobs biography is a must read for you.
B001ANSSDC|4.0|Realistic characters that have relatable qualities to people who live less than perfect lives. Quick read. Would recommend to friends.
B00BSBT8M6|5.0|There are too many reviews here on Amazon, many of them lengthy and well worded, for me to add anything other than this: I am changed by this story, perhaps forever.
B008BU75IQ|5.0|Best volume yet o f the Clifton Saga. Wonderful characterizations and Archer is back in style. Great story with a great setup for a spellbinding end.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Sooo much fun!  It's totally addicting.  My best friend got me started and now I'm hooked.  We now challenge each other or help the other one out.  We even got our kids to play.
B005DI9HPI|5.0|To be honest, when I first started reading I Heart New York I found it a little over the top. The characters and their antics were a bit bizarre. But after reading for a while I fell IN LOVE with these characters (except maybe Jenny, still a bit much).  Angela is cute and crazy and absolutely hilarious! And Alex, oh my goodness! They make the best couple.<br /><br />I heart New York is the first in the series, set in (you guessed it) New York. Lindsey Kelk does an amazing job of really portraying the atmosphere of each of the cities, LA, Paris, Vegas, London, in which the books in this series are set. One other thing she does fantastically is take you through the various stages of Angela and Alex's romance. Even though these books are crazy funny, in that sense, Angela and Alex's relationship is very real and sweet, and I heart it.<br /><br />If you like I Heart New York even a little bit, trust me, keep reading, the series gets better and better! Such a fun read, with a sigh-worthy romance.  In a lot of ways these books remind me of Janet Evanovich's Stephanie Plum series.<br /><br />If I could be any crazy book character in the world I would be Angela, her life makes me smile.
193700788X|2.0|So, I received the book a day early (of course this calls for some excitement, right?!). Once I started reading the book, my initial excitement began to dwindle. As the story goes on it seems like the same old thing but different book within the series, especially the last couple books. I felt that the romantic relationships in this book were almost nonexistent in regards to Sookie. And when there was it was just a quick wam bam thank you ma'am that felt like it was thrown in there so the author can say Sookie ended up with someone.. or did she? I can't even tell.<br /><br />Through my love and devotion to the series, I forced myself to give it 2 stars. Why 2 stars when the overall story was bland, repetitive and did not go into any character development in the story? Because the beginning of the book showed potential that could have resulted in an interesting conclusion to the series. Furthermore, the plot had an unexpected twist to it by the last few chapters. However, Charlaine Harris did mention that she ended the series the way she has always wanted to, and to put it nicely I can see why readers are upset and rated the book so low. Unfortunately, the ending of the book left me wondering about too many things in the book (e.g., what happened to Bill, Eric, Alcide, Quinn, etc.), which will probably be explained in the book that is coming out in October that is meant to be supplementary to this.<br /><br />It's probably a good thing I had a chance to sleep off how crappy I felt by the end of the book, otherwise I would have ranted about every part of the book that disappointed me. And trust me, I would have been able to write my own book about it.
B001N1DPDE|5.0|great knife love the quality and apperance. wish it came with micarta handles.bought some for forty bucks,would rather have payed more for the knife if it came with them.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|This is a good game if not a tad short.  Hope that more will be coming soon. The graphics are great.
B008VBYN80|4.0|Good time waster game. had fun but wish you could get those crystals a little easier. I don't like that they try to make you pay.
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|I love this game because I like to have different missions and different challenges. and the fact that you have to earn the points.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|great graphics and sound effects full of adventure.another great game from G5 deffinately worth playing.watch out once you start you cant stop.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This game starts out easybut gets more challenging as the size of the space is increased. My grandson loves it too.
B0070DOHQS|5.0|I've only tried it out enough to see if it worked, but it seemed like it worked flawlessly, and imo, the setup was very simple.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|I'm glad I made myself read this book and REALLY hope Hollywood doesn't screw this up. This book should be considered a fine piece of Americana, written in the natural voice of a fantastic example of the military that protects it and keeps us (and others) from having to worry about what true horror is. Bradley Cooper and Steven Spielburg have a lot to live up to if the likes of them really do make this into a motion picture.
B003ODIZL6|5.0|Thanks I love it you guys did an awesome job  pretty smart to think of a name for the dictionary

0738702994|4.0|I love the artwork on the cards and the included book is very informative. I love that this deck has a mythological background for all of the major arcana cards. The art of the minor arcana through me at first. It doesn't have the same detail and depth as the major arcana. Reading the other reviews, I see why they did this. The minor arcana features everyday life and they wanted the major arcana to really stand out. The pip and court cards also follow the symbolism of the RWS style closely. The cards are wider than I'm used to, but it doesn't bother me and they do feel a little thin. The packaging wasn't what I was expecting. It didn't come with the bag that the other reviews mentioned or a smaller box to store them in where they won't move around in the larger box, they were just plastic wrapped.
B00AG6Z92C|5.0|I admit it... I wanted the CD after I heard the duet &#34;Quizas Quizas Quizas&#34; with Jennifer Lopez.  But oh... it is beautiful and emotional from the first song through the last.  Buy it... don't think twice.  You won't be sorry.
B000001DQI|4.0|This is Elton John's best album. Still have the LP from the seventies. Under 5 dollars with shipping is a lot cheaper than buying from down loads( if you want most or all of the songs). And you get the liner with the lyrics and art.
B00B23O96A|5.0|When you read about the beginnings of this CD, you learn that these are the songs Eric Clapton enjoys to play when he's not playing his own hits.. and I see why.  They are fun and easy to listen to.  When I first got it, it reminded me a lot of Paul McCartney's &#34;Kisses on the Bottom&#34; CD, which I adore.  Both of the these legends of music share a side of themselves that is very appealing and a bit out of character but no less great to listen to.  Buy it... you'll like it!
B004ODLUGM|5.0|Really cute story, also bought the book and have the sequel DVD which is just as cute.  My grandson loves this.
B00C1BU7V8|4.0|I appreciated the movie, however disappointed so slow.  Difficult to maintain attention at several points in the movie.  Sally Field is an excellent part of the movie.  Daniel Day-Lewis did a superb job.  Not a movie that would keep younger people's attention.
B00BZOFUI2|4.0|I really, really like the new incarnation of Deep Purple, mostly because because I've always been a fan, since first hearing \\"Hush\\" in the early 70s. But the reason I like the newest version of the band is really Steve Morse. Some diehard Blackmore fans don't really appreciate Steve's contribution, but it is his versatility that makes him great. He wasn't named Guitar Player Magazine's guitarist of the year so many times that they had to make him ineligable for nothing. But he can certainly handle the classic licks of the old songs in concert anyday, as their recent DVD's can attest, and he brings new, fresh, unique sounds to this century's version of the band.<br /><br />This album is the first Deep Purple album that I can really tell his writing contributions to the songs. They have an almost \\"Dixie Dregs\\" quality of sound landscapes. In fact it is the almost urban quality of the classic Purple groove that made me take off a star. The songs that sound more like Deep Purple, sound somewhat rehashed, as if I've heard it before. I am writing this while listening to the album for the first time and I am discovering that there are some songs that will definitely go on my phone as permanent \\"road\\" songs. But just not all of them. It's rare these days to find an album that \\"blows you away\\" from start to finish and this release does not do that.<br /><br />In conclusion, it is a very listenable album, and there isn't anything on it that makes me want to turn in off. There are a few cuts that will make me go back regularly. But like I said above, it is really Steve Morse's contribution that is keeping this band going and probably will until Ian can't sing in concert anymore. I can't see them going on,(again) without Ian. But Steve has got a least a good decade of blistering licks in him.<br /><br />As a side note conclusion and query to other readers. Has anyone noticed that the very specific voices of singers like Ian Gillan, Steve Walsh(Kansas) and Robert Plant, and thepop artists like Billy Joel and Elton John, just don't hold up to the old songs in concert? The new stuff sounds good because the singers don't extend themselves like they have to when they try to tackle the old material. My theory is that this is the main reason why Plant doesn't really want to tour with Led Zepellin. We're all getting old and want these old guys to live (and sing) just like the old days forever. Wonder how Jon Anderson of Yes can still sound the same as he did when he was 20? Too bad Yes won't bring him back to do it.
B004GCPJDQ|5.0|As the below review states....READ the instructions and be a little careful of how you put it together and you'll have NO problems.<br /><br />Have been using mine for over 3 months now and have never had an issue.<br /><br />-Always charges when it's placed on the base.<br />-Never disconnects the battery.<br />-Battery have never dropped out.<br /><br />All in all a top product at a great price and it does what it says it does.
B00BLGZDVS|3.0|Movie was fair and really didn't hold our interest throughout.  Wouldn't necessarily recommend this one.<br />Glad we didn't see it in the theater.
B006YTTVHO|3.0|Very helpful an  to the point. I'm  be going over some points in the book again. I recommend it. Fast read.
B00BETX5PS|5.0|Was pleasantly surprised.  Great action and drama.  Wasn't sure how I would like Daniel Craig in the role of Bond but he really pulled it off.  Highly recommend!
B000065U1N|5.0|pretty graphic.  I didn't know just how graphic it was until I had to turn away a couple of  times.  It is very intense.  We will watch it again, but not for a while.  I do recommend it, but screen it first before watching it with kids or those very sensitive to blood and mangled bodies and violence.
B004XWMXW4|1.0|I do not like it. it is not what I have expected. It's just noisy. I think a good music is something we want to listen it again & again. I don't think I want to play it again.
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|This app is tons of fun. My one complaint is about the amount of time between missions, otherwise great app
0066620996|4.0|Three of the biggest things I took away from this book is to be a great business it has to be your passion, you have to think you can be the best in the world at it, and it has to drive your economic engine in other words somebody has to be willing to pay for it. All in all I think this was a well written and easy to read business book. It keeped my attention and the chapters flowed. I would definitely recommend this book to any business owners, executives, or anybody thinking about starting a business.
B008OOYALE|3.0|please fix the app crashes and my coins are disappearing right in front of my eyes without spending them! It's hard to get coins in this game as it is...also when I'm playing on my kindle fire hd when I move something from one place to another it sends the screen to the sky and it will not come back down the only way to get it to come back to right is to sell whatever I'm moving than visit a neighbor! If theses issues are not fixed soon I will not play anymore and uninstall I'm not wasting my time getting coins for them to disappear..I'm afraid to put my real money into this game if I seen my coins disappearing then without spending them I would be pissed!

0988936402|5.0|Ongoing giveaway of a signed copy of The First Pillar by Roy in my blog<br />(threeblankpages.blogspot.com/2013/05/everville-first-pillar-by-roy-huff.html)<br /><br />MY REVIEW:<br /><br />With the first ever book written by my friend Roy Huff entitled  The First Pillar, which is the first book in the Everville series, NEW TYPE OF FANTASY WRITING WAS BORN!<br /><br />The way this book was written was awesome. The way Roy connected two different worlds, one with space and time and one with the absence of those two was exceptional. For how many fantasy books I have read, this was the only book that I've encountered this kind of writing. It was magnetic and captivating.<br /><br />The main character of this story is Owen. He is eighteen years old and he doesn't have a father already. He is with his friends Dante and Anika. who are also living without fathers. Now, what I love about this book is the fact that he uses unique names for characters and places. Like using THEM as the enemy and The Other In Between as a place. We can't usually read books with those names in it.<br /><br />He made new worlds in this book. He has an impressive wide imagination! He sees things others can't see. But somehow I was frustrated by the lack of details and descriptions of places, making it hard to be imagined. BUT, that doesn't stop you from reading because it was still as captivating as ever.<br /><br />Another thing I love is the way he made different point of views in the book. I love how the main character can see the point of views of his friends by using magic--- Magic that only Roy can make.<br /><br />Furthermore, I also love the fact that this book is full of things and ideas about Philosophy. It makes us think critically and make us do mental exercises with ourselves, too.<br /><br />And also, the way the school clubs run contests like the Roundabout was also fascinating. It was the most unique contest in school I've ever heard.<br /><br />HOWEVER, I had the feeling of unfulfillment with the descriptions in the actions of the characters, making me want to read the next book. Cant wait for it to come!<br /><br />But overall, it was new to my taste and I was impressed even though that this is his first book .<br />KUDOS.<br /><br />my rating: 4.5 / 5illment with the descriptions in the actions of the characters, making me want to read the next book. Cant wait for it to come!<br /><br />But overall, it was new to my taste and I was impressed even though that this is his first book .<br />KUDOS.<br /><br />my rating: 4.5 / 5
B00A3NQNUU|4.0|This is a very fun game about building your own park/zoo. I enjoy playing it, weather its to kill time, or just for fun. BUT...<br /> At some point, this game was IMPOSSIBLE to open, just for a day, and then it started working again. it can take a couple minutes to open, but I guess I just have a pretty full kindle.<br /> Overall, I really like the game itselft, but please fix the sudden closing.<br /> Ooh, and readers, shh don't tell backflip, but I have spoilers. on youtube, it says how to get pretty much every dragon. I got a gold dragon by doing metal and fire, silver is metal and cold. it was random and I wasn't trying to get it. don't be disappointed if it doesn't work, its really rare.<br /> spring is fire and storm. I got one on my third try.<br /> I got a seasonal dragon on my FIRST try, with um, I forget sorry lol. IT SAYS ON YOUTUBE.<br /> moon, and sun I think, is sonic and storm.<br /> and there's lots of combinations for rainbow, like seaweed and firefly, bluefire and crystal, ice and river, etc. I haven't gotten rainbow yet, but, eh they say its the rarest anyway.<br />I hope these are useful for you! Any more you want, see on youtube. heehee, don't tell backflip I spoiler. ;D  (troll face)
0141345659|5.0|I forgot how I came to know this book- maybe it was suggested from a friend of mine or maybe I found it in the internet but it doesn't matter anymore because to whoever that gave me the idea to buy this book, I can really say thank you!  Thank you for letting me meet Hazel and Augustus' tragic love story in Indianopolis. Thank you for bringing me into the world of Cancer Support Group.<br /><br />  This book, with a colorful cover and a sad title is ironic.( You won't know where the title is from until you'll read the book and I have no plans of telling you. :D)<br /><br />  It is devasting, heart-breaking, tear-jerking yet funny at the same time..<br /><br />  Hazel Grace, a cancer survivor, or a cancer-bearing but tumor-shranked or whatever you call her,  shows the courage of a girl that doesn't have cancer even when she's connected to an oxygen tank for more than 2 years of her life. She's a strong girl that holds tears and she's witty and intelligent. AND she doesn't believe in the afterlife and the supreme God.<br /><br />  Augustus Waters, a physically strong man with his one leg natural and the other one prosthetic but a holding-back-cancer one. He is the most capable man in their trio, with Hazel and his bestfriend Isaac, who is blind due to cancer, too.  AND Augustus is funny and he believes in the afterlife and God.<br /><br />  ( The main narrator in the book is Hazel. Everything was her point of view so we don't know what's happening in Augustus' life unless Augustus will tell her or they are together. )<br /><br />  The way they were connected by one special book, Hazel introduced to Augustus, is cute.<br /><br />  The way John Green wrote this book as if he was in the part of a cancer patient was acceptable, with all the facts in it. And i like the part where he makes up names for medicines. We, the readers in turn would really feel the pain, the madness, the hopes, the hopelessness, the struggles, and even the gasping for air or throwing up that the characters are feeling. I give him 5 stars for that!<br /><br />  What I also love about this book is that you can get many lessons from it and quotes.<br /><br />  It shows us how the characters inspite of their illness can throw back to each other jokes about thier illness. This shows us positivy. EXELSIOR! This is what makes the book funny.<br />  It shows us how to feel when someone we love is die-ng or dying. It pains me a lot. I cried.  Or I think show us how to feel when we are on their shoes---How to feel like you're dying and you can't do anything about it. I cried.<br /><br />  While reading the book, I asked myself because I was afraid.-<br />  \\" What if that happens to me?<br />  \\"What if I'm dying?\\"<br />  \\"Will someone cry?\\"<br />  \\"Will someone say to me something before i die?\\"<br />  \\"Do i have lots of friends?\\"<br />  \\"Have i lived my life how it's supposed to be? \\"<br /><br />  Overall, the book will (be warned:) break your heart.

0142410705|5.0|This 2008-published book, ABUNDANCE OF KATHERINES of the very famous author of The Fault in our Stars, JOHN GREEN, is promising.<br /><br />The main character is Colin Singleton and he has a best friend named Hassan. He is a child prodigy and so he quickly can memorize facts and he reads a lot. All his life , he only love girls who are named Katherine. Not Katerine, Catherine, Cathy, Kathy, Katey, Katty, but KATHERINE. It was so cool because it was kinda  his fetish. It was funny because all the Katherines he loved, all dumped him, all broke up with him. And so, he thought of making a theorem on the prediction of relationships, who will be the dumper and who will be the dumpee.<br /><br />Colin, being a prodigy, wants to get popular and wants to be known. He wants to matter. He wants to stand out, but he realized that all he did was retyping, retyping and copying all the deeds of others. He wasn't genius. He is unlike Einstein as he says, not a prodigy but a genius.<br /><br />His best friend Hassan was the Mr. Funnypants in the story. He was the comedian and the clown in the story.  He makes the story very funny. :D<br /><br />And Lindsey was the one who broke Colin's streak of Katherines.<br /><br />I love the way John Green wrote the story. It was funny and it was hilarious but sometimes, it becomes so corny. It was boring in some parts because of the math and the non-interesting facts that Colin spits out of his mouth because he knows a lot. ahem. Then, what makes the story interesting is the presence of FOOT NOTES. They are so cute and funny. They are written for more facts and clarifications. They add humor and knowledge to the story.<br /><br />And, GUTSHOT, I must say, is a very awesome place. Love it.<br /><br />I didn't know where John Green got his amazing idea with this book but it was really good. Good in the sense that it has lots of lessons.<br /><br />I would really recommend this book for you. HAVE FUN! :)
193700788X|1.0|Very mild spoilers<br /><br />What an unfortunate ending to what started as a such a promising series.  From the abandonment of the theme of tolerance, to letting rapists win, to the lack of growth, to the obviousness of the mystery, to the boredom of reading pages of Sookie shopping, to the \\"uncharacteristic\\" way many characters behaved, to the laughable sex scene (\\"we slid against each other like seals\\"), to the sudden re-writing of previous actions and the significant continuity errors (such as the change in the way Sookie hears supes' thoughts, the sudden ability to take away telepathy), to the need to resort to magic to bring resolution (if there really is \\"resolution\\" at the end), I found this book incredibly disappointing.<br /><br />But it's Charlaine Harris' inability to make the overall arc believable to the vast majority of her readers (see other reviews and spoiler pages), even using magic, that makes me wonder.  Is she that inept a writer?  Or did she lie when she said she planned this for more than a decade?<br /><br />Not that it matters whether she's incompetent or malicious.  In neither case do I feel inclined to ever buy another one of her books.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|Loved the book very touching and informative. Finally science is accepting the larger universe. Would make a great movie. Fabulous read!
1476734941|4.0|Saw the show on public TV and started my fast without the book.  The book is great and is good reinforcement.  I've lost 7 lb in 4 weeks.  I started the fast to help my LDL cholesterol, but ended up losing weight.  I am having a blood draw next and anxious to see my LDL numbers.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Very easy to use and the numbers are very big. I don't need my glasses to use this calculator and this app is free.
B00AIBZLVY|2.0|For special effects you're better off with a Pixar movie, and for scares as well.<br />Where is the horror....anybody???<br />Give it up already and let the real pros do the WRITING and the DIRECTING, stop wasting money on nonsensical productions. Please do it for those of us who know what horror movies &#34;were&#34; like.....even one of them a year would now be quite a welcome surprise.
B00AFEXRME|4.0|Was not what I expected.  I was fascinated on how they filmed the flying sequences.  There was even an article in Popular Mechanics about whether it was possible to fly as they showed in the movie.
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|Thank You I Loved My Amazon Kindle USB Cable It Works Perfect Just Like The Original Kindle Cable Again Thanks
B005LAII3A|4.0|Another remake of an old movie.  Did enjoy it and the plot twists were different than the original and the special affects are very good.
076535618X|5.0|John Perry is back with his sarcastic humor, and his adopted daughter, Zoe joins him together with Jane. It's like meeting with old friends.<br />In this book - as in other Scalzi books - there is always something bigger going on in the background. The CU lies to Perry about its real purposes, but he is smart enough not only to play along but to turn the whole situation to his advantage - saving thousands of lives in the meantime.<br />Scalzi have put a little more than the usual twists and turns into this story right until the end.<br />If you want ten hours of entertainment, read this book.
B00AZNEW5G|4.0|not sure how true to form this was but it does tell a good story about out intelligence agents and how they tracked down bin laden.
B009NY43NY|1.0|Another reviewer said that it is too bad CH doesn't care about her characters as much as her fans do, and I agree completely.  These last couple of books have shown just how an author can abuse and swindle an extremely loyal fan base.  Like many other fans, I kept buying the books the day they were published, hoping that this one would return to the former glory of the series.  My hopes (nd financial investments) were not rewarded.  I do not understand how CH could do this.  Yes, she was contactually obligated to write more books than she might have liked, but one can assume she has been adequately paid for her work.  I  would have thought that out of professional pride or gratitude to the people who have spent so much money on her books that she would do better work.  Deeply disappointed and no matter what she writes next I will never buy one of her books again!
B007REV4T8|5.0|Good story line.  More about James Bond's personal life and of course the action sequences are as spectular as ever.
B0013TXA5Y|4.0|I've read through all of the Mortal Instruments books so far. The magic and world building was interesting and I like the characters for the most part. It is definitely YA-centric, so I can understand the appeal even though I found the romance between Clary and Jace rather too much Harelquin-zero-to-consuming. The 'adults' never really seem to have much to recommend them, even when they are forced into action. Overall, it was still worth spending time in Clary's world.
0399160450|5.0|Have read all Tom Clancy's books.  This is the continuing story of Jack Ryan's family.  The story line is out of today's headlines.
B0002E5O9G|5.0|I've seen the show three times on stage.  I saw the movie -- it was good but, there is nothing like a live show and those voices....which is why this is also my favorite concert.  I can never hear it enough.
B00AHTYI5M|4.0|I had seen the original years ago and this is a re-make but the story is still compelling.  Amazing how they pulled it off.
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|Found this book to be well written....didn't have to look back and figure out who was who or what was what.  In among tears there were laughs.  Stayed up late to finish and glad I did.  What a heartwarming ending.
B005LAII8A|4.0|Took me awhile to figure out the ending but I'm getting slow in my more mature years.  If you like time paradoxes you should enjoy this movie.
B00C1BU7V8|2.0|This movie is for those truly interested in history and I respect that. For me it was boring and something I would have turned off in 10 minutes if my husband wasn't interested in the story line. Not my kind of movie......
B005LAIIHG|3.0|Was not what I expected after all the hype.  Kind of a strange story and I read a lot of sci-fi.
B006T3RM08|1.0|Like the others mentioned, this product jams.  I recently took both the keyboard and trackpad out so I can actually use them
B005OCFHHK|5.0|With all the collectors sets out there it was nice to find a small and simple Blu-Ray set at this price.
B007DIQC90|3.0|This album struggles with variation and spams the same rhythm/texture combinations throughout the whole album. As one of the reviewers pointed out, the style is more formulaic than innovative(repetitive crescendos, too many \\"la la la\\" and \\"hey!\\" textures, frequent arias from the female lead singer). Whether this is thematic or just a crack in the creative process--I do not know. Moreover, the production is way more overdone when compared to other folk pop contemporaries.. Their hoist in fame is akin to Mumford and Sons in that the album uses one or two simple hook songs to carry it while the rest is cloned filler. Unless they expand their boundaries and introduce variety instead of banking on a limited generic style(which birthed the initial radio-loving pop hooks), then their survival rate will instantly become paper thin. Play this album once or twice, then shelve it.
B0091REZMW|5.0|First time playing this game. It's a bit small on the kindle fire 7inch screen. It is fun though I must say.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|It's a great app for people like me who don't care for other people. But an individual they cool. Thank you.<br /><br />Ok, Don't take what I said to literal or to heart. Know that I don't like a lot of people let alone a lot of new people. Knowing that about myself and the fact I do tattoos I have to make sure that I don't let others ignorance get to me even if their in a false bliss for them. As long as I set my goals and I work towards them I will keep achieving all that I set my mind to, maybe not tomorrow or the following three days but sure as shit,dollars to donuts it is guaranteed for those who put in are going to get what's need to help them better them self.
B009GEAPYW|3.0|Although I think it was very true to the comic I was not crazy about the animation nor the voice casting. I like Peter Weller, he did a good job, but in my heart Kevin Conroy is the voice of Batman. Every time Bats spoke it was not what I was hoping for.

B009NY43NY|1.0|What a waste of time and money!  Poor Eric, he deserved a much better ending.  CH, what a tease.....  I will never trust this author enough to buy another book from her.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Love this game the best on can play it four hours without getting tired. Love this game it's very exciting
B00AZL3PBK|4.0|It is good but I think a little to much like Mario. Well it is a good game I would say buy it.
B005HSL626|1.0|This app ruined my kindle the only way to fix this is to shut down.just walk on if you have a kindle before it's a victim.
1935670913|5.0|I loved the story. Great information. I recommend others to buy and read, and re-read. Smart ideas and worth the price.
B0090SI44M|5.0|Family friendly movie. My kids aren't afraid of monsters in the closet after watching this film. Humor that adults can enjoy and animation is great. A classic for your home video library.
0425252868|5.0|What a book!. The research and writing that went into it was extremely well done. The story is fascinating.I like the way the book showed us that war is hell and at the same time showed that there is some mighty fine compassion going on in the midst of that hell.
B008P9M614|5.0|I'm into the second season and so far I don't remember seeing any of these. There all good and some are a real tear jerkier.
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|This book is lovely, heart warming, gut wrenching and magical.  It weaves together a dirty reality and fantastical journey of fate and hope.
193700788X|1.0|Save your money. This series started out fun, but has gone out with a fizzle. Don't bother reading the last book. It's dull.<br /><br />I don't think the author was interested in her story or her characters anymore when she wrote DEA. Too bad she didn't wrap the series up a book or two sooner.
B00CL68NOG|2.0|Hilarious?.... You have got to be kidding me?!?!?  What a disappointment.  Barbra should stay with the Fockers!  She was a riot in those movies.
0393330435|1.0|Growing up on the Apple //e, Woz has always been a bit of a personal hero to me. Throughout watching the story of Apple unfold, I have always looked at Steve Jobs as the unsympathetic, opportunistic viper who basically used Woz and threw him away as soon as he had outlived his usefulness. When I finally received a copy of this book I devoured it quickly and with each passing page my disappointment grew. This book is deficient in so many ways that it is truly unforgivable. It's so bad that it has actually turned me on my ear a bit regarding Jobs - I now very much want to read his book, because I wonder whether putting up with Woz' passive-aggressive anti-humility drove him as crazy as it did me... and I just read a book Woz wrote, nevermind having to work with him day in and day out for years on end!<br /><br />First of all Woz, I would have thought you'd have figured that anyone who was interested in reading your life story might be at least in some small part technically minded and that you might have given consideration, for five freaking seconds, that we might be bored to tears or even borderline INSULTED by a book written at a fifth grade reading level. Seriously, this stupid book reads like Wikipedia's simple English version. A side effect of this editorial choice is that anything CLOSE to being technical concerning the development of the Apple ][ (which would have been incredibly interesting to this reader) is largely glossed over or ignored altogether. The most exciting part of the book for me was reading about the development of the floppy 5.25 - a triumph and testimonial to just how brilliant Woz is - yet even this was simplified to a maddening degree and followed by a profuse apology for 'getting so technical.' YOU DIDN'T GET TECHNICAL!<br /><br />Then there is that maddening anti-humility. Woz, anyone who picks up your book already knows you're a genius. It's part of why we love you and it's part of why we want to read your story. So why wouldn't you just tell your story and let it speak for itself? I simply can't understand the decision to push the story AT the reader rather than simply telling the story and letting the reader make his or her own inferences. This is a difficult thing to put into words as a reviewer and to demonstrate fully, but reading the book you get the feeling that Woz feels underappreciated by anyone who might read it. Every sentence feels as if he is screaming out for you to appreciate him while simultaneously being embarrassed for having to ask and subsequently tempering his assertions with \\"aw shucks\\" nonsense. \\"The Apple ][ was the computer that changed the world. So they tell me.\\" OH COME ON.<br /><br />The practical upshot of Woz' decision to write the book this way is that he comes off (inadvertently, I think) as a guy who is completely full of himself and who thinks everyone in his potential audience are borderline idiots who could never understand him, his thought processes or his motivations. The plane crash part of the book changed my mind about this though. This is the only place where the book finally started to make a little sense to me. Woz tries to gloss over this event too but I was left wondering just how much that crash messed up his mind. It certainly seems like the kind of thing that can send a genius off into mad pastures and effectively end his career - culminating in the writing of an overly-simplistic book like this one. Ultimately, I left thinking that this must be exactly what happened.tell your story and let it speak for itself?

B0054VVRBQ|1.0|I have been informed by Transcend (the manufacturer) that this product is END OF LIFED, meaning that there is no current production, no meaningfull future support, and no chance for future drivers to work with current or future versions of your operating system.<br /><br />I mention this as none of the vendors (or even Transcend, on their &#34;information&#34; site) have seen fit to share this significant data.<br /><br />Despite the occasional positive review, this devices does not work reliably with the MacBooks, unless you are running Snow Leopard.<br /><br />It's a shame -- it's a nice price. But the product is not worth the hair-tearing.
B000NDMRDW|5.0|I used this video to introduce extreme weather conditions and global warming to my 6th grade students and they were completely wrapped up in it! It was a great start to our unit.
0446580848|5.0|A novel of terrorism and antiterrorism set in a part of the world - Yemen - most know little or nothing about. I once served there and DeMille's portrayal of the country and it'seople is \\"spot-on\\". His characters are strong and true.  The story line is believable.  The action is high paced and non-stop.  He is at the top of his game with this one.
193700788X|1.0|This is quite possibly the most disappointing end to a series I have ever experienced. There are so many symmetry issues I do not even know where to begin. Inconsistent plot, inconsistent character development, inconsistent \\"facts,\\" inconsistent world building, etc. However, I have no doubt that there will be one consistent result of this book - a severe drop in Charlaine Harris' fan base. I, for one, will NEVER buy a book by this author again.
193700788X|1.0|I can feel Mrs. Harris' pain in struggling to write the last few Sookie books.  I can't even bring myself to write a decent review of the absolute worst ending that could have happened for this series.  Apathy to be had all around apparently.  Mrs. Harris kept insisting after all the hoopla around the leaked Sookie's HEA that those who didn't read the book based on knowledge of the ending would miss all the plot arc's.  Really???  Who cares! It's the end.  It can arc all the way to the moon and back and it wouldn't matter.  It is honestly a shame that Mrs. Harris dragged this story out at the behest of her publishers when she knew who it was all along, she should have wrapped it up at book 4 then it would make sense.  So yes, if you felt the need to capitalize on the popularity of the books, in great part to Eric and Sookie's interaction, then you should have felt compelled to finish the story you sold to us: hook, line and sinker.  This is nothing better than a bait and switch scam to steal your money.  If you feel compelled to read the book \\"just for closure\\" like I did, save your money and get it at the library.
B005S9EKCW|4.0|Never could get to the theater to see the movie so finally bought the DVD.  I am a lover of musicals, so I liked it but others I watched it with didn't like it as much as I did.  I thought the singing was fine and the production as a whole was excellent.  A little long but overall a good show.
B0083ZRAJS|5.0|I got the audio to go with this and I switch back and forth.  Read along and then switch to Anne Hathaway reading to me.  Great story and great audio.  Sorry I had not read it earlier.  (But this was audio was a good reason to wait)
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love this game but it cost to much how about 0.99 for two days then back to 6.99 thank you and please do this for me
B009NY43NY|3.0|Admittedly, I haven't read much fan fiction in recent years but I doubt it has changed too much. The general surroundings are there, the characters are there, but everything seems a touch off. After 12 books with the same characters one would hope that the audience would have a good sense of the character's well... character. And too many moments seemed out of character or out of place or slightly forced. I wasn't one of the fans rooting for any particular ending so I didn't really have a dog in that fight (pardon the expression) but, I did want the characters to ring true and they frequently didn't. There were also a couple of themes that I found off putting but bringing them up would be spoilery.
B00B4VI8MQ|5.0|Thoroughly enjoyed Cursed Onboard! Crisp graphics, entertaining plot with mysterious little girl to keep you company. A sure winner! Hints were liberal throughout game play.
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|I love this movie and I thought the music was fantastic as was the casting. It was definitely worth buying!
B00005QW5X|5.0|I love this movie!  I saw it for the first time when I took a course on rock n' roll in film, and I loved it so much I bought the DVD.  Hedwig is a transsexual with a traumatic past and present, which she chronicles through very entertaining songs.  So many smart ideas are communicated in this film; if you listen to the things she says you're sure to get a dose of philosophy.  A must see.  (Then afterwards, buy the soundtrack!)
B0000CD5FN|5.0|An album of covers. Joe puts his spin on songs that caught his ear. It's not one of his best, but it still has the energy and skill we've come to expect from Joe. -Evan from joestrummer.org
B003DWC6IQ|5.0|A very good read. Difficult to put down. Fast moving. Holds your attention. This book will not disappoint you. Highly recommended.
B003IKMR0U|4.0|Cheap simple game that is fun to play. No setup, just get out the dice and roll. There is a gambling element and a competition element to keep your interest. Easy enough for a 6 year old and interesting enough for my whole family.
B00BN3EE1O|4.0|Safe Haven was filmed in my hometown and I must say it was very good. Not quite as good as \\"The Notebook\\" but still good. I've just bought the DVD and watched it again and cried at the end AGAIN. There is a twist at the end that is unexpected. Having watched some of the filming I am proud to say that it shows off Southport, NC beautifully. I think everyone will enjoy this not just women.
B00AATFJK2|5.0|Got this for my husband for his birthday.  He watched it one night with a friend.  I was in the next room and heard them both enjoying it.  A great classic for sci-fi lovers.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|So fun to read. I can only imagine having the nerve of these characters. Kelly did an amazing job looking for more of her books
B005HHSXP0|5.0|Although it features little Annabeth and no reunion (that we've always been waiting for), it's quite a worthy read. Recommended!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|a nice exciting game for all ages. me and my 54 year old mom enjoy playing this game. I highly recommend it.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I wanted to buy it but i was unsure. It ended up being a fun game( one of my favorites). I recommend it!
B009NY43NY|5.0|This is my favorite so okie stack house book so far! It keeps you on the edge of your seat the entire time. There are lots of twists, surprises, and character that we haven't seen in a while. The ending was my favorite part but I will say I did not see that coming!!
B0060MYM7O|5.0|If you enjoyed Season 1, then there's no reason you won't like Season 2 of HBO's Game of Thrones.  This show is excellent.  Season 2 starts to explore the magical elements of George RR Martin's universe, something that Season 1 largely left obscured from view.  Season 2 maintains the excitement and pacing witnessed in the latter half of Season 1 through out its duration.  More than the 1st season, this one got me hooked to GoT.<br />This particular box set includes a booklet with the Claimants to the Iron Throne, which is helpful in sorting out the intertwined story lines.  The show looks AMAZING in blu-ray quality.  Although this set is expensive, it is entirely worth the money.
B009NY43NY|4.0|It's nice to have closure. I know Charlene is sick of writing this series and wanted it over, but I was disappointed by how she ended everything in such a neat little way.  I am one of the few folks who was rooting for her to end up with who she does so I'm happy about that, but it was obvious she was steering in this direction for three books now.  All things must come to an end and I'm sad to see the series go.
193700788X|4.0|It kept me interested. It took turns that I didn't expect. I loved it.  I am sad that it is in the end of the series, but it ended well.
B0054SMID0|5.0|Great plot and acting -a worthwhile and thought provoking movie. Great plot and acting -a worthwhile and thought provoking movie.  Do I have to say it twice to be recorded as a review?  Most folks will thoroughly enjoy this movie.  Well done!
B008OOYALE|5.0|I love this game because if you have some thing going on @ the time your egg is done or something else it won't make you start over like some games I would get it.

B00CHIMG6Y|4.0|Great acting, good suspense from start to finish but not for the sqeamish.  Not sure the 12 yrs and younger would enjoy.
B0060MYM7O|5.0|What can I say? I love GoT!<br />Blu-ray is the way to go bc of durability. This series is incredible, read the books too bc you will be addicted and waiting for the new series to be released is so hard to do.<br /><br />Having all three formats is great BC you can watch it in any device almost or buy yourself the Blu-ray and give away the DVD or vice versa.
B00AKL1XPU|4.0|This game is amazing looking, fun and easy to play. Don't have to spend real money to enjoy, and there is lots of variety.

B00CDT41RY|1.0|And since Tarantino and others of his kind can't just walk up on a black man in REAL life and call him the \\"N\\" word without getting beat to a \\"PULP\\"! Then why not get it all out in a movie!! Where Hollywood can even REWARD you for doing so!!
B0066W1AZK|4.0|Difficulty ranges from novice to omgwtf, easy to use, overall great app. Only gripes are minor, for example screen will not rotate if kindle is turned and occasionally pieces will line up in reverse and app will have to be reloaded. This happens rarely, overall very I impressive app.
193700788X|1.0|I've read all of the sookie stackhouse novels and short stories and this book was nothing more than a let down. There was really no closure to the series or explanation of any sort. The characters acted out of sort and did not stick with the tone of the book. It was sad to have such a great series end in such a disappointing way. I kind of wish I didn't read it and had stopped reading the series earlier. All in all I am very upset at the way this series ended.
B00BGZ8OLA|2.0|i do not know what the whole fuss was about? it was a horrible movie. unfortunately i bought it, doh!
B005LAIIKI|5.0|One of my all time favorite movies. Tarentino does it yet again! Christoph Watlz is amazing as always. Love it.<br />DJANGO!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|So convenient to have the entire bible, with my favorite translation available with just a touch.  I have this on my Kindle and Iphone.
B00BETX5PS|5.0|Daniel Craig is an amazing Bond in my opinion. I love how this one comes sort of full circle in the end!
B001NEK2GE|5.0|I love this thing.  I have had one for a while, and used it so much I wore out one of the thumb buttons, so I bought another one when it went on sale to replace it.  You can configure the lights to be practically any color you want, and the 22 programmable buttons works amazingly well in games like SWTOR, WOW, etc... There is a slight learning curve when you first get it, but once you are used to it, you won't want to play MMO's without it.
B009GEOLM4|5.0|Awesome Awesome Awesome. If only DC could make all their heros translate this well into movies. Can't wait to watch part 2.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|I can't wait for the next book.  I need to know the fate of John Snow, the Lannisters, Starks, Dany and the realm.  Can't wait for the Dragons to battle the others!
0307744434|5.0|Can I give it ten stars? Flat out the best book I've ever read. I loved everything about it - from the characters, to the touch of magic, to the romance, and the setting. The vivid detail used by the author made me feel like I was there - which is exactly where I wanted to be. One of the few books that I can't wait to read again. It managed to be sophisticated and fun at the same time. I didn't want it to end but I loved the ending nonetheless. Most authors can't end a book. This one can. I absolutely recommend this book to everyone.
B0052AC8C6|1.0|I surprisingly got 2/3 of the way through this painful movie. DEFINITELY not a kids movie, it's really sick, twisted and gruesome. It's more a series of disjoint events, there's hardly a plot.
B000059POY|4.0|just to see richard burton as the worlds most arrogant, drunken, perferted pop star on the face of the planet!  he's just to perfect! drunk on his face, crawling on the GLASS FLOOR of his stretch limo, grabbing at (actual &#34;Miss Teenage Universe1967&#34;)  girl's bikini panties,demanding she satisfy his&#34;GIANT NEED!&#34;  then add ringo,star as a mexican gardener, turned revolutionary rapist?  all in the first 20 minutes!  totally worth it!  even if i hated the rest of the movie,(which i don't)  i'd still buy it, just to watch the first 30 minutes, over and over, as the noble richard burton, drops his pants, and jumps a manaquin! orgasms, then screams out; &#34;mi cassa! su cassa!&#34; pure classic gold!
B0064X7FVE|5.0|This app is great for tracking the weather do matter what I am doing or where I am going.  I love it.  It is my favorite.
B007HC3LHS|5.0|For the first time in a long time, I had trouble putting this book down.  The main characters were believable and real.  Even Cathy's OCD was understandable considering the danger she was in.  Creepy.
B00AA7O22U|5.0|A whole generation of long-ago young stud heroes joining forces to be &#34;as good once as they ever were!&#34;  If you watch EXPENDABLES 1 & 2 back to back, you'll be absolutely exhausted!  Mucho, mucho action!!!!!!!
B0073XV2W2|5.0|Suarez, combines an in-depth knowledge of current day cutting edge technologies and ongoing scientific research which highly realistic near future scenarios that provoke some very serious thoughts about our coming future. All this in a breathtaking action laden page turner you will barely be able to stop reading.<br /><br />This is a serious highly entertaining read in line with Suarez's previous books. Highly recommended to anyone who is interested in the future...
B000V39KDO|5.0|A surreal film with action galore.  Buff guys everywhere for the gals to watch and the leading lady is a beauty.  Boyfriend and I watch over and over when TV lineup is dull as dishwater.
B002KVSJ64|5.0|Breaking Benjamin Is very creative and I like how they keep their sound on every cd they release.I bought Dear Agony at mckays for 92 cents, sorry amazon,but I do recommend you buy this cd along with their other 3 cds they released.Also, this cd contains no cussing, but I didn't mind cussing in it, but its good for people who don't like cuss words in their music.
B00BGZ8OLA|5.0|Even recommended this to my 82-yr-old momma and she truly enjoyed the unexpected twists and turns of the slightly lengthy plot.
B0087ZG7UW|5.0|bought for my mom for mothers day. this is her favorite movie and she wanted the 1960 black and white. i am extremely happy to have found it here
B004LQGXPA|5.0|I think George C.Scott would have been a better soldier than Patton himself!  We never tire of watching it classic.
B009NY43NY|1.0|I have now read all 13 books and am very disappointed.  This book does not match the arc of the whole series.  The characters seem out of character and it is lacking depth.  After investing so many years in this series, this book makes me wish I hadn't.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This an excellent app that's easy to use. The that it is free to use is amazing for such aquality tool have on the go.
B005HSG3VK|3.0|Not very sturdy, would have preferred something like the IPad covers which are sturdier .Doesn't  keep the screen clean the either.
B0091REZMW|3.0|The game is ok.  I would like it better if I could zoom in on the rooms.  Works fine on my kindle fire so far.
0385349831|1.0|I was so looking forward to reading this.<br />What a disappointment in most every way.<br />It is a very poor and rather egotistical re-take on the beautifully crafted \\"The Prophet\\" by Kahlil Gibran.<br />Where \\"The Prophet\\" succeeds in sharing powerful, timeless wisdom, this book fails profoundly.<br />There is an effort to appear wise and therein lies the conundrum - one cannot appear to be wise.<br /><br />\\"The Prophet\\" is divinely inspired - I highly recommend it. A much more fulfilling use of time and money.<br />Or, read \\"The Alchemist\\". It's a jewel.
B006OV7RQ4|4.0|Martha Marcy May Marlene starring Elizabeth Olsen is an interesting film, even though the ending is a little bit of a letdown. Olsen is absolutely spellbinding as the title character, and it's good to know that at least one Olsen family member has acting chops! Olsen's character Martha, suffers a horrific trauma after she escapes from a cult. Martha has difficulty reconnecting with the outside world and with her sister played Sarah Paulson. Martha doesn't have any healthy boundaries, she was subjected to horrible things during her stay with the cult. Martha's self-identity is nonexistent, she is flashbacks daily from what she went through. There are some plot holes which made parts of this movie frustrating but overall, I found this intense drama worth while. Enjoy!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Great second book in the series. I enjoyed being taken along with Ana and Grey as their relationship changes. Looking forward to the third book!
B004SJ3BCI|3.0|Fun to play.  Graphics are just as good as purchased game.  But field is often obscured with frequent ads.<br />Ugh!
B009KS4XRO|5.0|I enjoy playing this in the evening. Just kicking back and playing. Sometimes I am disappointed when it has froze on me and I do not get my credits but that is rare. For the most part it works just fine.
B00AYB0TOW|1.0|Could not have been more disappointed by this. If you care about ANYTHING more than seeing people get shot, then this is not the movie for you. I love action movies, I love comic book movies, but wow, I don't think I've ever cared so little about the characters in a movie (what were their names? who the hell are they?) and the story is....aw, who needs a story? Shooooot Stuuuuuff!!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I can't wait to read the next one!  It keeps you right on the edge of your seat with the new twists the author wrote in.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Well this game is awesome as u can see from my title but it is more than just awesome it is like pure awesomenss lol but the only thing I didn't like was that it deleted the whole thing my high score waz there but nothing else no charachters or coins I earned or evenmy facebook information was deleted but what bothered me was my high score was still there but I would so buy this game even though its free lol which I like too and it is really fun and addicting and the characters are cool exept i really didn't like Tokyo
B00BIK3FAI|5.0|Wow, happy i bought this. Stunning graphics, beautiful detail, entertaining story, lovely music. I really enjoyed it. Looking forward to a grownup version.
B008P8B9ZY|5.0|This is exactly the same as the blue and white sole matching Crocs Adult Duet Sport Clog that I also purchased but for less. It serves my purposes to enable me to wear a matching different color quasi orange and other blue croc on each foot at the same time to rally my cause against the Nassole Toe-County frauds. I would prefer a real more vivid orange and matching white sole instead of dull off-white.<br />I'm more than satisfied. Mission accomplished.
B00BWDJILG|4.0|Four SUPERB Stars! Tenor and soprano sax titan Joshua Redman follows the intensities of the \\"[[ASIN:B000N4S95Q Back East]]\\" trio and the \\"[[ASIN:B004KNM3GC James Farm]]\\" quartet recordings with this lovely, more laid-back, and atmospheric ballad recording split equally between a string, brass, and woodwind orchestra and a jazz trio/quartet. It is produced by pianist Brad Mehldau who joins the 5 quartet tracks along with Redman, Larry Grenadier on bass and Brian Blade on drums. \\"The Folks Who Live On The Hill\\" is a lovely, string-laden trip through this classic ballad with Redman starting with the verse and beautifully soaring above a superb arrangement. \\"Easy Living\\" starts conventionally on a bed of lovely strings, but goes in an angular direction with Redman getting off some intense, declarative phrases.  \\"Adagio\\" by Johann Sebastian Bach is a stately 'tenor sax, double bass, brushes on drums' trio reading that enhances the normal sonic pallet of this classical work. The quartet version of Lennon-McCartney's \\"Let It Be\\" turns up the heat considerably in a performance with gospel-like flourishes. And perhaps, best of all, Wayne Shorter's \\"Infant Eyes\\" becomes a smoldering vehicle for Redman's soprano sax, \\"Stardust\\" gets the relaxed boss tenor sax reading, and the gradual intensity of \\"Last Glimpse of Gotham\\" has strings used quite effectively and adventurously. These enjoyable, beautifully-recorded orchestral and quartet performances are quite a change from recent Joshua Redman outings and could become a romantic-evening and late-night listening favorite. The orchestra with strings, playing songs deftly arranged by Dan Coleman, Patrick Zimmerli, and Mehldau, definitely enhances the 6 orchestral tracks. Very Definitely Recommended. Four LOVELY Stars! (12 tracks; time: ~57:42)
B0001GOH6Q|5.0|Currently in the middle of watching this as I type.  It is a great film and it came in without a scratch.  Would recommend this buyer and film to others.
B00A9X9ORI|1.0|I paid for HD and constantly saw it going to SD and even then it wasn't clear.  I couldn't rewind properly.  It was the worst streaming experience.<br /><br />I use VUDU and Best Buy's version as well and did not see that problem on my home network.  Only Amazon's VOD cannot seem to handle it.
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|This book was well written, full of surprising twists and turns, lots of action, and i cannot wait for the movie! This book was so awesome i read it in 3 days!!! Cassandra Clare is an amazing writer and knows how to surprise you! I cannot wait to see what's in store in the next books! I'm so excited to continue the journey with Clary and her Shadowhunter friends!!!! :) :) :) :) :) :P
B00AA8Q0FQ|3.0|This movis is overrated as most kid movies of this type. It is sort of scary for kids under age 5.
1560100842|5.0|In the 1980s, when I was a Pratt student in Brooklin, I was experimenting with a super 8 camera. (Who remembers super 8 now, right?!) But with that I was able to try out the information on movement from veteran animater, Preston Blair! I love the old Disney classics, Pinnochio, Fantasia, etc. as well as the warner Brother cartoons and MGM cartoons and Blair contributed to Golden age of cartoons in the 40s and 50s! His drawings from Fantasia( the dancing hippo) and &#34;Red&#34; the sexy girl from &#34;Red hot riding hood&#34; are so inspiring to any wanna be animater! No one book can have everything you need to be a great animater and it takes a fasination with how people and animals move as well as dedication to finishing the work to improve but Blairs drawings are clear with simple direct communication! I have the original How to animate cartoons vol 1 and 2 and I have worn out the covers so it's great to have this later edition that combines the 2 books with new illustrations from this master animater! Pages 80 to 87 include drawings of a wicked witch, cute kids and a pretty heroine that are not in the earlier volumes. The witch drawings have strong &#34;wicked&#34; attitude with evil poses and hand gestures that say &#34;witch!&#34; while the heroine drawings have that pretty Dorothy damsel quality from the Wizard of Oz! I also think of Wendy from Disney's Peter Pan. Blair made what he did look easy when it certainly wasn't but the pages make the art of animation accessable and understandable and fun to draw! Pages 184 and 185 show his drawings of the Honeymooners and the character and attitude of Ralph Kramden and Ed Norton are clearly there! And we all know that the Flintstones are Hanna and Barbera's stone age version of that classic series. The pages that show run , walk, gallop, sneak cycles etc are drawn so they can be easily adapted to any character you can imagine and draw! I'm so glad to have this mint condition book to go with my earlier Blair vol1 & 2 on animation at a good low price! There is great nostalgia in looking at these techniques today in the midst of all the CGI hype! Thanks Amazon. com!on animation at a good low price! There is great nostalgia in looking at these techniques today in the midst of all the CGI hype! Thanks Amazon. com!
B006O6F932|2.0|I know many kids toys are plastic &#34;made in China&#34;, but this is not worth near the price it's offered for. It's not sturdy even when it put together properly which frustrates the kids as it comes apart while they are playing with it.  I think this item is a waste of money... I recommend buying a few MH dolls instead..
B00AESN8XY|5.0|I would recommend this to anyone that loves strategic games really expensive if you want to buy everything with out having to play them all on normal or brutal
B009JZVT70|5.0|I am amazed at the ratings decline from Season 1 & 2.  For fantasy fans, this is an awesome show.  From the stories crafted amongst the various characters as how they are in the present, but their histories in rich detailed background stories of how they came to be the way they are, leading to a greater sympathy, especially for the villains.  For children and adults, Henry's (the adopted son of one character and the biological son of two other characters) acting is superb and draws us in as the catalyst for unexpected changes.  So many of the sets and costumes are dazzling and clearly no expense was spared.  The CGI is great for a TV series.  If you have missed any of the seasons or episodes, I highly encourage you to retrieve them.  Last year I obtained both the Amazon Instant Video and the Blu-ray versions of this series.  This year, money is tight, so for now I'll live without the Blu-ray.  If you missed the first commercial on the 5-5-13, it is hilarious.  At any rate, this is a show that can be loved by the whole family.  WATCH IT!!
193700788X|1.0|I read this book with trepidation.  I had a very good idea Sookie would end up with Sam.  I thought I was all right with that and I might have been if time had been taken to build it up.  Sam is not a problem for me.  I wish Harris had spent the time Sam was avoiding Sookie, having him comfort her, trying to cheer her up, until she realizes how much he really does love her.  Alas, she threw in a plot twist and the romance of Sam and Sookie never happened.<br /><br />The book is sloppy. She sets up these bad guys and really goes nowhere with them.  Copely Carmichael sells his soul to a devil.  The devil never shows up again, not even to collect.  In fact, we don't see ole Cope and his trusty (and also soulless) chauffeur Tyrese until near the end of the book.  Amelia Broadway is brought back and you'd think she'd be given satisfying confrontation with her, now soulless, father.  Nope.  She doesn't even see him.  Amelia's apparently just there to say \\"howdy\\" one more time and to be pregnant like almost every other woman of childbearing age in Bon Temps.  I'm sure Sookie's got one growing now too.  Because isn't it true, ladies, that a woman is never completely a woman unless she has a man and children?  What?<br /><br />And what about this \\"soul\\" stuff.  It's mentioned over and over again in this book in one context or another. I thought maybe this was a theme of the book, but there's never anything concluded.  It's proved in this book that vampires actually do retain their souls, but no one actually reacts to that fact.  It's not like Bill or Eric or Sookie ever wondered about the possibility right? In fact, Sookie wonders about this in the beginning of the book.  She doesn't even say \\"Huh, I guess they do still have souls.\\"<br /><br />I also thought I was neutral to Sam until their wild day of passion.  I've never felt any mutual sexual attraction between them, aside from that one time they were interrupted and Sookie never thinks about it again.  It surprised me how distasteful I found it.  I blame that on what I said in the first paragraph.  There were no gentle moments between the two of them.  It was friend and partner Sam and BAM!<br /><br />What's most appalling to me is that Harris has finally succeeded in making me dislike Sookie.  She's irrational, uncompromising, ungrateful, self-absorbed, self-pitying and impatient.  I've been feeling this way since the end of \\"Dead Reckoning.\\"<br /><br />I'm so very very sad about this.  I've read this series nine times and loved every minute.<br /><br />My suggestion, try the Mercy Thompson series by Patricia Briggs [[ASIN:0441013813 Moon Called (Mercy Thompson, Book 1)]], The Parasole Protectorate series [[ASIN:0316056634 Soulless (The Parasol Protectorate)]], by Gail Carriger or the Cat and Bones series [[ASIN:0061245089 Halfway to the Grave (Night Huntress, Book 1)]] by Jeanine Frost.  So much more satisfying.nine Frost.  So much more satisfying.
B009OYTAL8|5.0|This show is truly great, not only for those familiar graphic novels or comics, but for those who enjoy watching great drama and a charismatic hero.  There is a back story so we can understand the dramatic change he endured to become such a different person.  At the series has developed, he is joined by others in on his secret life and mission.  Fantastic and truly worth watching.
B000JMKQX0|4.0|Very good book, I really enjoyed this work. I found it entertaining and fun to read. I'm looking forward to reading more from this author.

B005IQZB14|3.0|I was fascinated by her journey. It kept me glued to the trail. Being a California resident, I marveled at her bravery to walk the Sierras and the volcanoes of the Pacific ring of fire dotting Oregon. It was like getting a grand tour myself. She developed her story around her brokenness that she healed by looking and communing with nature. A woman of sensitive insights to the nature of men and beasts, she turned potentially dangerous situations into harmonious encounters, dodging potentially disastrous events during her trek. I liked the part where REI would send her a pair of boots anywhere, free of charge if she was not satisfied with her boot purchase. Regrettably, her first boot purchase rendered her feet swollen and bizarrely without nails because her boots were a size too small.<br /><br />There were parts I disliked especially where she enumerated the things that she realized her mother was, and that her grief and longing for her dead mother was based on something she did not understand. Her relationships were all needing to be tended, she had been estranged from her family.<br /><br />I strongly recommend this for those who like to travel and especially those who like the outdoor life.
B001RHPJBU|5.0|I like this song, it is worth buying and spending the money on.  Instrumentals and the vocals are great.  Good lyrics.
B0034DGPEU|4.0|I quite liked this novel, as I felt it appeared most historically correct, & wonderfully believable. I chose 4 instead of 5 stars  because I would have liked the ending to have seemed less rushed.  I felt that it seemed that all the unfinished character stories were quickly brought to an abrupt close, but perhaps in reality,it might have been my wanting more....Loved it!

B009NY43NY|1.0|The first several Sookie Stackhouse books were so amazing. They brought you on a creative and fun filled rides. At some point a few books ago I would say Charlaine Harris started to resent these books. They have brought her so much wealth and fame but she couldn't even for the fans sake hold it together until the series was over. Instead we are left feeling cheated. I loved Eric and Sookies relationship and it seemed he was really in love with her for so many books. It was the last book where Charlaine forced us to see the cracks in their relationships even though it was unfounded and no explanations were given.<br />This book sadly disappoints. ****Spoiler aler***** She ends up with Sam? Not only does that sound gross and pathetic because we all know Sam has been in love with Sookie the entire series but Sookie was NEVER into Sam. Charlaine is again forcing us to believe this actually could have happened but it just couldn't. This is a miserable ending to the series books. I know I can't say don't read it because if you have been reading the whole series to leave this out is a missing part. I wouldn't give the author more money. Either share it on kindle if you can without buying or WAIT and borrow it from the public library. Charlaine Harris doesn't deserve our money for writing such a horrific book without any thought for her fans and love for Sookie. I think it's time for her to retire from writing.

B00BFUC8RC|4.0|This game centers around an amusement park where its stuffed inhabitants come alive after dark and ride all the roller coasters after-hours! However some of the coasters are in major disrepair and it's up to you to make sure your fluffy companions make it safely to the end of the ride!<br /> This game vaguely reminds me of &#34;Extreme Road Trip&#34; and is very appealing in the way it preforms and the way it operates. The game is simple enough: DON'T DE-RAIL! Although this may seem like a simple task, the levels progressively get harder and harder as the rides become more elaborate; with loops and high speed jumps, it can be difficult to decide whether to brake and whether to speed on through! Overall, this game is a blast and will definitely spark you'r interest!
B000SGGUWS|4.0|I am with the show now im obessed with the books.amazing absolutely love it.i will continue to read the rest of the series
B00881VLCE|3.0|I enjoy the puzzles very much BUT every time I go to play it I have to uninstall it and reinstall it to get it to work am afraid to purchase any of the puzzles afraid I might lose them having to reinstall it all the time.And pay for them again if I want them bad enough. Hope the company reads reviews and works on problems report. Haven't figured out how to get out of a puzzle after it's started but have decided I didn't want to do it don't see a back button on actual puzzle page when I try to go back it goes to add
B007TXN4TK|4.0|I do not play piano beyond Chopsticks. I did however play the violin, so am familiar with tempo and such. This is a fun game to play. I like that there are different levels and that you can preview the music. I may even upgrade to the paid version someday (and that is saying a lot from a cheapskate!)<br /><br />It does take a little effort to get the hang of it, but that is part of the challenge. I imagine it might bore a piano player, but for me, it is quite entertaining.
B00006WKSZ|4.0|I grew up with the Scorps and like this cd, if you like old school heavy metal you will enjoy it.
B003G4W49C|4.0|I was desperate for a book and pulled this from my husbands kindle. It was engaging and thoughtful. I can't wait to read more
B00BWBHIUG|1.0|It's a charming game.  That said, the developers put an on-screen button in the wrong place, which means if you're right-handed, after struggling for a week to get 5 pearls you could spend them all at once by mistake on something you didn't even want.  I've quit playing it out of frustration with that.  Note:  a lot of people here seem to think the game is educational.  It is not.  At all.  It is very, very charming and fun.  But not educational.
B00CHSPB8Y|3.0|This game is not great at all. You only do one thing and you can't chang your suit. And second level you die no matter what. and after your second time getting on and of it will freeze or not let you play so don't get this app it's a ripoff.
158270208X|5.0|I'm almost done with my 5th Gratitude book and I just received my new one! Love this journal. Keeps me sane!
B00005QGAT|4.0|Whenever I play this CD, it skips the 3rd song.  This one of the main songs I bought the CD for. The first time I played it, I thought I just must have been busy and didn't hear it. The next time I noticed the cd skipped over it. And it has been doing that consistantly. It's annoying. I also don't care for the tracks at the end which is a bunch of talking. Although it is interesting, when I just want to hear the music and shuffle the CD with others it is a pain. Other than that I love the music. I wish I had gotten a different version.
0385349947|5.0|Whether you're male or female, if you currently have or intend to have a career and/or a family (read: nearly everyone), you should read this book. The depth of the research she's done is really impressive. It's not a &#34;feminist manifesto,&#34; it's well-reasoned advice, backed by hard data, on how to move the world forward to ensure the most successful businesses and families for everyone.
B002BI6SMI|5.0|The setting is, mostly, Paris and the star is Irish, but this is a<br />distinctly American story: given that the authorities are bound to be<br />incompetent or corrupt, you have to go rogue to get anything done,<br />such as saving your daughter from white slavers. This is a brutal<br />film, with an unending supply of bad guys and only one good guy, and<br />the suspense is tremendous. What holds it together, really, is Neeson's<br />steely command--amid all the action, he is steadfast, smart, and<br />incredibly resourceful. Don't as much as blink, because the surprises<br />come so suddenly that you'll miss them.
B009PK9SB8|4.0|Works great but you don't want to use it for an extended amount of time as it sucks the battery quickly.<br /><br />We do really like it!
B008D30K7E|5.0|a most interesting and funny  book.  A clever author gives us a leap into history while at the same time giving the reader the impression of a feisty ever young mind in a 100 year old body. full marks from our book club also
0547569653|5.0|This book was amazing and well-researched. Little propaganda or personal agenda. Its inspirational and motivating. Most chapters center around a particular race in a particular year and end with a comment about running and a vegan recipe. A rewarding read for everyone.

B0002HZ18C|1.0|I bought this for a diorama of a ship wrecked in a storm so it's not a total loss.  It doesn't look ANYTHING like the image online - it doesn't even look like the image on the package it came in.  The pieces are all flimsy red plastic.  The directions are really bad and the whole thing is just CHEAP.  It looks like it could've come out of a cracker jacks box except it's too big.  The directions say to glue the pieces together only with the model glue but there's no glue in the box.<br />I do not normally write reviews, even though I firmly believe in giving credit where it is due.  I am not one to &#34;bash&#34; a product, but I'd say don't waste your time or your money on this product!

B005HJU7HA|5.0|I used to have the complete collection as well in one book.<br />It was convenient to have all the stories in one place but that made the book<br />itself an inconvenience (;-)). The book was too unwieldy and after a few reads,<br />spine has all but disintegrated.<br /><br />This collection is the perfect replacement and has extra content too.
B0087GJ8KM|4.0|Daniel Pink provides a look at how we interact with people and try in all aspects to move them in our direction.  The book goes beyond the concept of selling and provides insight and tools into leading and managing through change.

I give this one star only because you can't give 0 stars.

B008Y1RTUG|2.0|I was very torn about watching this movie.  I am a suppergeek for fairy tales and beautiful graphics.  However I have to date seen a Kristen Stewart movie that does not make me want to throw the remote or popcorn at the screen in massive frustration.  Finally I sat down and watched it.  I was amazed by the special effects and CG work! Also Theron and Hemsworth held there own in making the film good.  Theron especiallly did a wonderful job in putting depth in her character.  It almost makes the movie worth watching, almost.  Then Kristen Stewart strikes again.<br /><br />I really did try to give her a chance.  I sat there there the whole movie saying to myself 'she will show some emotion, she has to show some emotion.' Nope there was no emotion to be found.  The farther along in the movie I got the more frustrated I became.  I kept shouting at the screen 'Kristen really? Smile, frown, scream do something!!!' I felt incredibly bad for Hemsworth who tried so hard to get her to act.  I kept encouraging him though the movie to not give up and maybe he could get her to act her role.  Oh well so much for lost causes.<br /><br />Again Theron did a specatular job and made the movie worth watching.  I would suggest watching most of the movie on mute and just focus on the effects because they really are excellent!  Just be prepared to be upset with the lack of emotion that we have come to expect from Ms. Stewart.

Listening to this album makes me feel like I haven't showered in two weeks, and I am packed in the back of a sweaty, smoky van on the way to TJ to get even wasted than I already am!

B0047Y0FGY|4.0|Tina Fey is witty and droll and sarcastic and SO much fun to read. She's like that best friend you have that mutters snide remarks under her breath, but she's still the nicest girl in the group. Her humor is self-effacing and always on point. I wouldn't mind hanging out with her at a happy hour sometime. love her, loved the book.  Hope she writes another!

0385535147|1.0|Why do I keep reading Grisham books.  The last few have all been the same.  How can they call this a \\"Thriller\\"?  There are no thrills.  Three hundred pages of complicated plan executed by \\"hero\\" with nary a glitch in the plan.  Nothing goes wrong, no surprises.  At one point near the end, when a real thriller is just pulling out the biggest surprise, the hero talks about being completely relaxed.  He's like that all the way through the book because nothing every happens to upset his plan.  The only surprise for the reader is that although he knows what the predictable end of this book will be, you don't know the killer of the judge for sure until the last 10 pages, but it is totally predictable, unexciting, boring.  His last few \\"thrillers\\" have all been like this.  The plot is so complicated (the hero's plot) that the author has to keep his plot simple.  The hero spends the book driving around, slowly executing his plan and we gradually learn what it is.  Beyond that there is nothing to look forward to but thankfully turning that last page. SNOOZE!

B00BWBHIUG|4.0|basic grow and wait kind of game yet oddly addictive.  the colors are bright and the artwork is first rate.
B009NY43NY|5.0|I loved this book. I love how in this final book instead of Sookie sacrificing so much for others and reaping no rewards other than new scars, grief, and nightmares- everything she ever did for others, pays off. When it's her freedom on the line, in the moment she feels the most alone and abandoned, people came out of the wood work to return the many favors they owed. I like how comfortable Sookie was in her own skin at the end. Not because of a new lover or any other outside forces, but because she finally understood her own worth, inner strength, and capability. She finally knows what she want s and what her future is going to look like. There is no more unanswered questions of \\"Is what Sookie wants in her life going to be possible?\\" At the end of the book, I knew that whatever she wanted, she'd damn well have. And I am really pleased with how her character has grown and yet still has the fundamental values and quirks that made me fall in love with these books to begin with. I began reading these books in 2004, way way before the True Blood hype, with it's acid-dream plots and over dramatized performances of the book's characters. Sookie, in the books, was always a little innocent despite being literally exposed to different mindsets and was always polite and overly accepting. She was a normal girl with an abnormal gift that made her feel she had no where to belong despite the fact that she would never go anywhere else. I think this ending, where she is finally happy with her home, friends, herself, and her future is the perfect ending to the series that I've spent nearly a decade following. So... Yeah lol- Go Charlaine Harris!!
0544002318|5.0|just got my book and really enjoying it. recipes are great and the stories have been really interesting. would recommend to a friend for some inspiration for sure.
193700788X|1.0|I'd say there might be spoilers in this but honestly at this point who cares? It's nothing new. The whole entire series is spoiled. I knew it would not be Eric. Harris herself has said she could not understand why fans liked Eric so much, in spite of the magnanimous way he is portrayed by Askars, which in itself means nothing to me since I read Eric before I watched Eric. To answer your question Harris, we like Eric so much because Sookie likes Eric so much. Duh. What a slap in the face of Sookie, that she is so stupid to fall in love with a character that the writer herself despises. Way to go Harris, way to go. I think you may have delved deep into your own personality when you created the vampire, sucking the life out of everything good and bright, making money off the weak, with no conscience, no care for your actions and behavior, and then hiding in the dark in the face of your critics. No book tour here for her, it's no wonder at all really.<br /><br />But it goes part and parcel with the ending for Sookie, lackluster, boring and moving right back to square 1 where Sookie was from the very first book, in Bon Temps, with Sam, at a bar, reading the simple minds of it's patrons. There is no character growth except easement of her financial woes and the possibility of creating another life, so dismal, with such a terrible gift that it has to be hidden, suppressed and god forbid, used for the benefit of the host.  What made Sookie so special and so entertaining is completely lost. She has been reduced to a wine swilling, trucker mouthed, spineless and directionless slut. I wish she, at the end, she would have woken from the Rat's beating, with Sam having run them off, in effect saving her, and have the rest of it having been a dream, like the ending fight sequence of the Twilight Movie. This is what would have happened to you, Sookie, if Sam did not come along and save you from the Rattray's. That could at least explain the utter lack of character development of Sookie. She would be exactly where Harris wanted her to be, with Sam at Merlotte's with no physical or emotional scars that she earned and now carries for absolutely no reason whatsoever. Never have I been more disappointed in a character. It's not worse than Anita Blake, it's just not.<br /><br />But to be frank and honest, I really don't care who Sookie ended up with because Harris succeeded in her goal of making us all hate the woman Sookie becomes or fails to become really. It's hard to have an investment in the future of a character you could not care less about. And after this end, who could care? The last 4 books were so lacking and so poorly written that you could not be mistaken if you thought that True Blood, the TV, show was not effecting the story arc in Bon Temps. So much of what Harris should have done in this series could not be done, for fear of killing the fan base of the show. I get it, completely. Does that make it OK for me? Get rid of the utter disappointment, the betrayal I feel at having shelled out each year for the latest book, waiting on pins and needles for each one and devouring it in a matter of hours? No. Will it make me purchase another Harris book, as I read now she is starting another series? No way. I no longer trust her. I feel completely ripped off.<br /><br />I think she made a very poor business decision in terms of her fans, while it was so obviously lucrative for her. She sold us out when she sold the rights of the Sookieverse to HBO. Then she beat us over the head with the lies, the deception and the huge paycheck, by releasing crap after crap, 4 times then wrapped it up with more poorly written crap. She lost creative control. So all the fans have to go on was her interview opinions on characters and story arcs, no longer could her writing be trusted. It is the most blatant, backhanded, two faced talking you can do as a writer. Write one thing for your characters, then say in an interview it means something completely different and we her loyal fans just don't get it. I get it, you don't care about Sookie anymore. Well guess what? I don't care about Sookie anymore either. Mission accomplished. It's too bad really. I will never get that time back or the trust I so faithlessly placed in Harris as a writer and a care taker of my most favorite characters. I am crying now, not because of Sookies's ending, but because of her utter lack of place anymore in my literary endeavors. She's gone, but not really. She's just not at all who I thought she was. I wish she would have died so my grief could at least feel warranted.<br /><br />So, for me this series ends at book 8, and part of Book 9, up to Bills should be death. He should have died, that Rat Bustard. He should not get to be friends with the woman he abused, raped and cheated. And I will write Sookie's ending in my own mind as completely loved cherished and protected by whomever she saw fit to choose as her HEA. Poor Eric, just poor Eric. There is nothing to say of his demise. Maybe he should have met the sun too. Hello True Blood! Maybe YOU will get it right. Doubtful, but it is my last hope for Sookie.

193700788X|1.0|FIrst, this is the very first of nearly 100 ebooks I have returned for a refund- and according to their refunds policy it is eligible for refund. And BTW, I called the publisher as well, and spoke with the (sincere here) ever gracioius Ann Seward regarding my opinion of this novella. She correctly pointed out that artists can write as they see fit, and I do support that position, just not with my limited purchasing dollars.<br /><br />I am terribly disappointed in this... NOVELLA. The fact that Sookie Stackhouse literally gave up on a promising relationship when it was unnecessary is a sad bit of work. That she'd take up with Sam within days of the anti-climactic 'divorce' from Eric is so completely out of character as to be unbelievable.<br /><br />Far too short to be the final book in this series, and it certainly isn't worth what I paid for it. Knowing Ms. Harris is capable of writing much more engrossing material, I find this perfunctory conclusion to a previously interesting serious to be contrived and sad. I'm doing my best to write this review in a mature, considered manner, but really? Inside I'm spouting 10 tons of four letter words, most directed this shoddy excuse for a finale, and secondly at the enormous waste of money I spent on this... NOVELLA.<br /><br />I strongly doubt that the promised \\"after\\" work will be able to explain the failures that riddle this work, and I'm very surprised that any editor would accept this piece... for publication. I'm equally shocked that Ms. Harris would bother publishing such.<br /><br />Not the least of which is that this novel is what I bought myself for my 55th birthday.
0440117658|2.0|Maybe I expected more from Vonnegut. This wasn't it. It was a let down for me, and I read a wide variety of writers. And I'm generally a pretty flexible reviewer. Sort of a mundane book.

B009NY43NY|1.0|I call bull to CH's claim that she knew from the beginning who Sookie would end up with.  If she knew, why break rules?  Why manufacture new magical items?  It's ridiculous.  And how about investing in a binder that includes world rules instead of sticky notes placed around the monitor of the computer?  In her interview with The Wallstreet Journal last week, CH discussed tying up over 100 characters.  As if that was a must.  Not everyone needs to make a cameo, especially if that cameo is flat.<br /><br />CH milked this cash cow till her udders fell off.  She could have ended the series earlier rather than renewing for four more books, but she didn't.  That's on her, as is the poor writing, contrived plot points, and broken world rules.  I don't care if she's tired of it!  Do it right, or don't do it at all.<br /><br />I've read CH's other series, looking for something that resembled SVM, but honestly until this series she was just an okay cozy writer.  That's where she needs to be, because clearly this type of success does not sit well with her.

0385349947|4.0|There is a lot in this book. It is part anecdote and memoir, part business class, part psychological analysis, part cultural analysis and, most importantly, full of footnotes. The footnotes are there because, quite frankly, some of the statistics cited are impressive and without a citation it would be easy to dismiss them as exaggeration.<br /><br />This book puts in black and white a lot of facts about being a woman in business and technology.<br /><br />There's also a lot of gray and the lessons to be gleaned are not exclusive to women. Sandberg does an excellent job of working her way through her critical mistakes as well her perceived mistakes that turned out to be gold mines.<br /><br />A section that resonated with me was in the middle of the book when she talks about crying at work. I too am a person prone to tears when I'm sufficiently angry or betrayed. Sandberg tells two stories of how her tears actually forged stronger connections with the men she was working for. She goes on to describe how she evolved a style that connected more deeply with colleagues rather than just being all business.<br /><br />When I see these best-case outcomes, I'm encouraged, but I'm not foolish enough to believe it will work every time. But it does make it easier to analyze a situation, make a better choice and move on. Even within the same company, no two managers will necessarily react the same way to person's request for help.<br /><br />Ultimately, there were countless examples of the unconscious short-changing we tend to do to ourselves. \\"Women rarely make one big decision to leave the workforce. Instead, they make a lot of small decisions along the way, making accommodations and sacrifices that they believe are required to have a family someday. Of all the ways women hold themselves back, perhaps the most pervasive is that they leave before they leave.\\" Does that sound harsh? Absolutely. Is it true when you start thinking about the little things and small choices? Absolutely in many or most cases.<br /><br />I still have mixed feelings about this book, probably because it does hit close to home for me. I've re-read sections out of frustration. I've been actually tempted to highlight the whole book. The chapter \\"The Myth of Doing It All\\" was brilliant and there's a great quote from Gen. Colin Powell.<br /><br />I encourage you to read the book, think about it, re-read and think some more. Somewhere in there, take some action to stop short-changing yourself.ely in many or most cases.<br /><br />I still have mixed feelings about this book, probably because it does hit close to home for me.

1400069807|5.0|This 480 page book is the result of 3.5 years of investigative journalism by Pulitzer Prize winner Michael Moss. This is a serious book with many notes and citations to back up the statements made within. I either knew or suspected every single thing in this book but I still learned a number of things and had my suspicions confirmed.<br /><br />I appreciated the professional tone of the book and love the fact that it was not a soapbox rant or unfounded opinions being slung around without just cause. The only time he strays into opinion is with some anti-Wall Street bias in two places in the book; the food companies are in the business to drive profits and when they choose to go public the investors are the owners, so what's wrong with wanting profits or increased sales? In the final three paragraphs in the epilogue he finally reveals why he wrote the book: to inform the consumer and to empower them to make food and drink consumption choices that are best for them.<br /><br />Moss documents interviews with food scientists and marketing and advertising professionals. He tells the stories of food company's beginnings and about processed food successes and failures.<br /><br />Of vital importance for Moss's expose is the explanation of how the processed food industry has spent lots of R&D money to show the effect of food on the brain: what things can we become addicted to (spawning eating more in between meals and to eat those things during meals), what components cause cravings (to, and which foods impede satiety therefore causing us to overeat at each meal. We know and accept that illegal drugs and alcohol and cigarettes or caffeine in coffee and other drinks can affect our brain, but seldom do we hear about how common foods in the Standard American Diet act as drugs in our brain: causing addiction, triggering cravings, and leading to over-consumption.<br /><br />The book is in three sections, in a different order than in the title; I later figured out why. Sugar goes first to establish the effect on the brain and the addiction and cravings it creates and sugar is an energy food for humans. It has a calculable bliss point to help recipe creators match the food to what will make the brain happy. Fat is next, and it is also an energy food for humans, and it has a high bliss point, beyond what the body needs for energy to survive. Salt is last in the book and it brings out and amplifies flavors. Although is not essential for human life to survive it is easy to become addicted to and the tolerance builds and more and more is needed to satisfy. At the end it comes full circle to explain how those three things are key to potentially harmful to humans if not eaten in moderation and how all three are essential to producing processed foods that can be cooked or baked to a nice appearing food that has the intended flavor after a sometimes long shelf life.<br /><br />I had previously learned about the addictive nature of sugar in books by Kathleen Desmartins (Potatoes not Prozac and The Sugar Addict's Total Recovery Program).  I had previously learned about the addictive nature of sugar in books by Kathleen Desmartins ([[ASIN:141655615X Potatoes Not Prozac: Solutions for Sugar Sensitivity]]and [[ASIN:0345441338 The Sugar Addict's Total Recovery Program]]).<br /><br />Interwoven through the book is an explanation of the US government's role with the Department of Agriculture and the FDA and how they are looking out more for the food companies than for the health of American consumers whose taxes pay their salaries.<br /><br />This book focuses on processed foods. I am disappointed that Moss mentioned that newborns love sugar and hate salt and that formula companies are trying to make formula sweeter. I was disappointed that Moss never mentioned human milk (breast milk) and told us what the sweetness level exactly is (it is high).

B008IJTFYW|2.0|I wasn't really that impressed with this app for my Kindle. I guess I expected something else. But may be worth it to someone else.
1931559317|5.0|This is for the sky and telescope pocket sky atlas...<br />First, you should be aware that almost if not every single 1 star review on this product is because the ipad/ipod type portable app didn't work.  While I'm not discounting their frustration, these two items should be separate on amazon.  The spiral bound book is a five star item as the reviews reflect.  The pages are smooth and water resistant (pretty much waterproof) coated.  The size is extremely portable but big enough to be very useful.  The charts are smaller chunks of the sky than your typical full size book, but that is to be expected.<br />It is laid out so that as you turn the pages you go from the top of the celestial sphere to the middle.  In essence, it is like you took a globe of the celestial sphere and chopped it horizontally into sections like a tiered wedding cake.  Each page shows the next larger chunk of sky sphere slice.  This way it is easy to find something on one page and if you need to see a little beyond the item you can turn to the next or previous page depending on the orientation and see a portion of the previous page and the majority is the next slice of sky.<br />It feels very durable.  I've carried it in my backpack and used it in heavy dew conditions.  So far it still looks pretty much new.  The binding allows a fully open position so the page you're on can be fully flipped all the way around the book and behind it to lie flat or it can lie flat open with two pages.<br />The sky charts are simply beautiful will tirion-esque art.  Simple, clean and informative.  I highly recommend this book as a portable guide and all around star chart/atlas.
B0094BB4TW|4.0|I really like this for my Kindle. I have facebook on my laptop and also my cell phone so I thought it'd be great for the Kindle too. Pretty good!
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I have been using this for all my meetings and keeping attachments with my notes. The ability to have this on all my devices is great for the mobile information life I live.
B00BZODDYU|5.0|All I can say is WOW!  This film was released on my birthday in January, and with me being a horror genre fan...I was overjoyed.  The movie was sooooo awesome.  The monster is sooo believable and terrifying...this movie rocked!
193700788X|1.0|The last several Sookie books were bad, and I expected this one would be also. I bought it anyway, just to finish out a series I've read for years. I think that's the kind of buying the publishers and author were banking on...those who felt compelled to buy it for closure. It was not a good book. Every single character still &#34;living&#34; made a cameo. I'm surprised Gran's ghost didn't pop up somehow. Anyway, that part of my life is done.
0345529057|5.0|This came very fast, I am working on finishing another book, but i cannot wait to crack these guys open, I have only heard great things about the books, and if they are better than the show, I have nothing to complain about!
B00A7OJ0DC|5.0|We absolutely love this movie.  Our kids love it and all adults enjoy due to the old arcade theme.  The 3d effects are good too.
0385720920|5.0|Book came very fast, and I read it in a few days, I could not put it down. I was the first book of Palahniuk that I have read and it wont be my last.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|I like this app. It is really fun to play and seems really nice. overall it is on of my favorite games right now.
B00CL0J99K|5.0|I rarely give 5 stars for a movie. I don't know what's wrong with people, but I've found out you will always have people who don't like a movie. It could be the best movie it the world and people will still look poorly at it. Just ignore those people, and enjoy this fantastic movie!
B003O86FMW|5.0|Im completely on Peetas side, boy deserves her and much more, and I loved learning more about Haymitch and his victory :)
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|this is awesome I'm usually late when I wake up but it is loud so I can here and I'm no longer late thanks alarm clock
0439023521|5.0|was fast paced, and loved the romance confusion amongst all fighting, does a good job of creating a whole new world with Panem
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|very fun and addicting game. it is just like farmville but you are building a coral reef. you'll get tips/challenges from nemo and his friends that you have to complete. some of them take pearls that are very hard to get. I think they did this so you have to spend money. I skip those challenges and do the ones I can do without spending money and it is still fun. not a game for children alone. it takes strategy. search online for tips and tricks. that has gotten me further without spending money
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|Katniss can be taken as a little weak or emotional but it fits when you think about how much shes lost by now, but still am glad to have it all wrapped up.
0307341542|4.0|I read Gone Girl first and was blown away by it so I was really excited to read Sharp Objects. It was enjoyable but not nearly as much as Gone Girl was for me.<br />Camille is a reporter sent back to her small town that she hates to cover a story about two young girls being murdered.<br />I liked Camille and felt for her but at times she was a little to far fetched to be really believable. The places on her back mostly, maybe just me but I can't see how it would be possible to carve some of the words into her back without help? Just the way your arms would have to reach around but maybe I am wrong.<br />Amma was a bit to over the top at times, I am sure this was sort of the point but it just became annoying and seemed a bit overdone.<br />The ending was not as much of a shock as the author intended at least for me but I did like it. As with the ending to Gone Girl I think it fit the story and the book.<br />I loved Gillian Flynn's writing style so will pick up more of her books. Overall I think if you loved Gone Girl you may like this one but I doubt it will be as much as you loved Gone Girl.
B007H1HQW0|5.0|Details were clear and item was exactly as described. The bottle was cut neatly. I will try a different shape bottle next time.
B000FBFN1U|5.0|You never have any idea where this story is going. And that's what makes it so great! A must read!
B00B5JBZGS|5.0|This cd marks the return of original lead singer Jesse to the fold. And wow, does he make a difference. This is, if possible, heavier than anything we've seen from these guys yet. Get this if you are a Killswitch fan or just a fan of all things metal!
B00973902K|5.0|\\"Call Me Maybe\\" is an incredible song by Carly Rae Jepsen, Tavish Crowe and Josh Ramsay. And wow, how this song gets the royal treatment when Carly sings it! She does this with lots of energy and just one listen proves it! The music fits in perfectly with those clever lyrics, too; Carly never skips a beat and this upbeat tune just couldn't have been done any better.<br /><br />Carly sings about a young woman who is instantly smitten with a guy, so much so that she gives him her number and hopes that he'll call her for a date. This is a theme many people can relate to which makes \\"Call Me Maybe\\" an even better song. This is also great music to get people up and dancing on the dance floor.<br /><br />Carly Rae Jepsen amazes me with her excellent performance of this song. I highly recommend it!
B003VANOFY|4.0|I'm updating my review from 1 to 4 stars.  The headphones only lasted six weeks then would no longer take a charge.<br />Logitech warranty support was good.  They replaced the headphones in about 10 days and paid for shipping both ways.  They also informed me that they have recently upped the warranty period from two to three years.<br /><br />The headphones can be used while being charged.  Be careful if you choose to wear them with the charging cable plugged in.  The charging port is very fragile.  Tension on the charging cable will break the port.<br /><br />The headphones themselves are awesome.  Both the mic and headphones sound good.  Also, the mic appears to have built in clipping protection.  If the volume suddenly gets loud it will compensate and anyone on the other end will still be able to hear you clearly.  Also, I get more than 40 feet of range through multiple walls in an electronically noisy environment.  I'm using Windows 7, 64 bit.<br /><br />By far the best headphones I've ever owned.  I just wish I could safely use them while charging.
B009UX2YAC|2.0|First I really liked it and I was really good but then it got boring and I stop playing it for a while
193700788X|5.0|Yes, I read the ending chapter first!!!!!<br />I just had to get the suspense over with.<br />I then slowly enjoyed Sookie's last journey in it's entirety!<br />Thank you Charlaine for 13 wonderful books! I loved them all!!!!<br />This one gave me great joy in reading as the others have!<br />The ending really wasn't a shock.<br />I always knew they belonged together, it just took them a while to figure it out! (Not that I don't totally love Eric!!!)<br />I must say...I will miss Sookie!
0937381888|5.0|I am just getting started but my son is very experienced and a trained chef and he LOVES this book. He recommended it as a great place to start and a constant reference source. So, here I go!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Addictive.  This game is a lot of fun.  Daughter loves it also.  SHE IS MUCH BETTER AY IT THSN I AM.
B002PQ7JQK|5.0|My ONLY sole complaint, I would LOVE to have seen these episodes remastered in true HD (16:9 ratio)  in widescreen
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway Suffers is a bit like Temple Run by game base, and that is actually why I like it. So freaking fun!
B002KSPKRS|4.0|We have 2 sets of these and even though they are discontinued they are still worth buying. I only hesitated when I was looking for a set that would work on PS3 and PC too. They only sets that claim to do that are &#34;coming soon&#34; so it was better to just get the one for the system that gets played the most. Best gaming headset hands down and a really good quality mic to boot. These do go through batteries so I suggest either buying large packs of alkaline AAAs or a few sets of rechargeables.
B00AS1Q8FW|3.0|Earlier in 2012 and for whatever reason, Tom Cruise decided a singing role in The Rock of Ages would be a smart role for his borderline flailing career.  Hopefully, Cruise learned a lesson that an un-relatable character, like Stacee Jaxx, was always going to be pitiful to watch, even if he did star in the massively successful Mission: Impossible sequel just a few months prior.  What's the point here?  A typical Tom Cruise film is either incredibly good or horribly bad.  Despite his reputation outside the world of film, Cruise is still a reputable actor - and if he'd stick to a certain genre of film, he might even be able to revitalize his career to its previous prominence.  Clearly, he's at his best in action flicks, and even might be able to sell himself in a comedy role (Tropic Thunder), but outside of those roles, it's difficult to take him seriously right now.  Sure, within the last ten years he's starred in a few intriguing dramas, like The Last Samurai or Collateral - but since Collateral (despite his box office success stories), Cruise has gone stale.  Could Jack Reacher be a career difference maker?<br /><br />Directed by Christopher McQuarrie (The Way of the Gun), Jack Reacher stars Tom Cruise as a former military police officer, named Jack Reacher.  Now a drifter, Reacher arrives in Pittsburgh after former military sniper, James Barr (Joseph Sikora) allegedly kills five people outside a sports stadium - someone Reacher has already investigated in the past.  However, as much as Reacher would like Barr to be guilty, he discovers not everything is as it seems and takes it upon himself to investigate these murders that the District Attorney, Alex Rodin (Richard Jenkins) believes are worthy of the death penalty.  At the same time, Rodin's daughter and defense attorney, Helen Rodin (Rosamund Pike), agrees to defend Barr and assist Reacher to try to save Barr from the death penalty.  Robert Duvall, David Oyelowo, Werner Herzog, and Jai Courtney also star in supporting roles.<br /><br />Much like the Jason Bourne character for the Bourne novels, Jack Reacher also originates from a series of novels - created by author Lee Child.  Jason Bourne and Jack Reacher are very similar characters, not so much because of their origin (even though they are both officers), but because they are two incredibly powerful individuals (mentally and physically) that you wouldn't really want to mess with.  Unfortunately, unless you're digging into their past, characters of this nature are only interesting to an extent.  Jack Reacher is well-trained in combat and weaponry, so yeah - he's a total badass.  But, what fun is it to watch one guy constantly succeed at everything?  He takes down five guys with no problem (not to mention he does it with a Spider-Man-like banter), hits a bullseye with a sniper rifle like it's no big deal, and is basically smarter than everyone else (especially the police and a District Attorney).  As an introduction to the Jack Reacher character, this film does a fine job of putting him on the map.  In future films, though, he needs to be more flawed, a bit more open to emotion, and have a better villain trying to kill him - otherwise nothing sets him apart from established characters, like Jason Bourne, James Bond, Agent 47 (Hitman), or Rambo.<br /><br />As far as Tom Cruise goes, he does his usual \\"thing\\" with the starring role in Jack Reacher.  The description of the Reacher character in the novels is a tall, overpowering man.  Obviously, Cruise doesn't really fit that description - but it doesn't hurt the film that he's not the perfect character actor for Jack Reacher.  Cruise is easily believable as this smart, athletic drifter that mysteriously outshines everyone else around him.  He's not an ego driven character, yet he's driven none-the-less.  In any event, the spotlight is on Tom Cruise for the duration of the film, briefly allowing newcomer Jai Courtney to spread his wings as the villainous henchman, Charlie.  Speaking of Charlie, his boss, a Russian businessman known only as The Zec, is supposed to be the \\"big bad\\" of the film, yet the character is weakly written and without an overpowering motive for his villainy.<br /><br />The underlying question is:  is Jack Reacher worth watching?  The quick answer is yes, but it comes with strings attached.  If you combined films, like Shooter, Rambo, or any other \\"frame job\\" film, you can already say you've seen Jack Reacher.  However, you can make that quick judgment about most every film these days.  Jack Reacher is a new, mysterious character that walks around with a great deal of baggage - and he's an honest, charismatic character with personal qualities to be admired.  In the end, this film creates more questions than it provides answers, which means there better be a few more sequels, otherwise this film will fail to stand apart from the pre-mentioned titles in the future.<br /><br />Overall Film Grade:  C<br />FNDNreview.com<br />Facebook.com/FNDNReview<br />Twitter.com/FriNiteDateNiteeaking of Charlie, his boss, a Russian businessman known only as The Zec, is supposed to be the \\"big bad\\" of the film, yet the character is weakly written and without an overpowering motive for his villainy.<br /><br />The underlying question is:  is Jack Reacher worth watching?
