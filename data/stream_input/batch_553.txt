B000BCKFWK|1.0|Quite the worst film I have ever seen in my 76 years! <br />The inadequacy of the above rating system reminds me of the story about the old Danish professor who found himself forced to modify the usual marking system in order to do justice to the proficiency of his students. In the usual system the highest mark was 6, 4 was pass. He had to extend the system downwards to -23. I give this movie the mark -24.
B0007YMUZW|5.0|This is one of the best albums of this time period.  It portrays one of the greatest stories of any cd I have ever listened to and that is alot.  The lyrics are magnificent especially on Meadowlake Street.  If you do not like this album I would like for you to sit down for about an hour and listen to the cd while you read the lyrics.  If you still don't like it then do it again, and if you don't like it after that then you are probably just an idiot or musically challenged.
B00008PX8P|5.0|This two disc set is a Zep fan's dream.  This dvd showcases the gods of rock in all their mythic glory.  The first disc is a fantastic performance from the Royal Albert Hall in 1970.  The show opens with a rocking \\"We're Gonna Groove,\\" a song which is heard all to rarely.  Page's violin bow solo on \\"Dazed and Confused\\" is a real treat to hear in 5.1 sound.  Other highlights include Page's guitar jam, \\"White Summer,\\" a very long \\"How Many More Times,\\" and a classic Bonzo drum solo on \\"Moby Dick.\\"    Disc 2 is might even be better than the first disc.  It opens with a raw and heavy Immigrant Song.  I always prefer the live renditions of this song because of how raw it sounds.  We are than treated to four tunes from Madison Square Garden in 1973.  We are then treated to portions from two very famous Zeppelin performances, Earl's Court 1975 and Knebworth 1979.  It all begins with a very well filmed acoustic set that really shows the band having a good time.  Following the acoustic tunes we receive a mammoth rendition of \\"In My Time of Dying.\\"  This tune is an absolute showcase of Zeppelin's power and their creativity with classic blues.  \\"Trampled Underfoot\\" is funk-blues fusion at its finest.  Page's solo on this tune raises the hairs on my neck everytime.  Knebworth was Zeppelin's final performance in their native England.  The band's career was drawing to a close but you wouldn't know it from these energetic performance.  Tunes such as \\"Sick Again,\\" \\"Achilles Last Stand,\\" \\"In the Evening,\\" \\"Kashmir,\\" and \\"Whole Lotta Love\\" take on a whole new life on stage.  The songs are equal to and in some cases superior to their studio counterparts.  All in all this is the absolute best concert dvd that you can buy.  The wait was well worth it.  A true treasure for Zeppelin fans the world over.  Nuff said.
B00003CWPL|4.0|Eraserhead is one of those few films that were clearly never meant to be \\"enjoyed\\". If you want a film that will make you happy and fill you with a warm glow you are clearly in the wrong place. In this film David Lynch has set out to build a mood, to disturb the viewer. In this he remarkably succeeds. This film is never comfortable to watch; at times it truly makes the viewer squirm. One thing I have noted over the years, is the polarizing effect this film has on audiences. I've met a few who adored the film, and many who despised it: but never anyone with a \\"casual\\" opinion. This is memorable cinema, arguably memorable art, and for this reason will always be on the top of my favorite films.
B0006GAOBI|5.0|words cant describe how much i love this movie. it made me think, laugh, and cry. it took me 2 times of seeing it to understand it, but each time i watch it, i find something new. some people may call it weird, but i learned a lot from this movie. please please please buy this movie. just renting it would be fine. i think everyone should see this movie. donnie goes through everything every normal person goes through in life. he is human. i have nothing else to say then: SEE THIS!
B000BM6AVA|4.0|I'm going to focus my brief review on System of Down's Hypnotize more on their questionable decision to split the album's up and release them 6 or so months apart.<br /><br />Now, if each CD had been over 40 minutes then that would've been justified since a CD can only hold 80 minutes worth of music.<br /><br />But the previous album half called Mezmerize was only 36 minutes long and this newer half is only a little shy of 40 minutes long.  That's only close to 76 minutes worth of music folks.<br /><br />While I like both releases (though I feel that Mezmerize is the stronger of the two), I have to give this business decision to screw people by making them pay 28 dollars for 2 releases that could've (and should've) been put on just one CD just one star.<br /><br />Burn both CD's onto just one 80 minutes CDR and listen to them all the way through from start to finish. It makes a very cohesive listening experience and makes the whole even stronger than the parts.<br /><br />I'm surprised that more reviews on here haven't mentioned that SOAD are making people pay double for just 76 minutes of music.<br /><br />That bothers me, but then again, the albums ARE really good stuff and really catch the band in an incredible transitional period which really makes me excited to see where they go next.<br /><br />Hopefully the rumors of them splitting up are just that, rumors.<br /><br />I'm a fan back from the beginning when they first came out and I think they've just gotten stronger and stronger with each release.
B000007T1M|5.0|I love system of a down, and their entire catalog but there is just something special about this cd that puts it above the rest. Unlike many reviewers, I'm not going to go through this cd track by track and review each one, because I would just give every track the same review (perfect). Maybe it's because when they recorded this cd they weren't a household name and they were poor and pissed off. Maybe it's because the times just gave them so much more material. For whatever reason this cd is a classic and should not be overlooked as it often is. For some reason toxicity propelled system of a down into the limelight, I don't know why, I love toxicity, but this cd blows that one out of the water. This cd also blows mezmerize and hypnotize and steal this album out of the water (even though those are all excellent cds). Maybe this isn't the cd to start on with system of a down, if you wanna get into SOAD you might wanna try with some of their newer stuff and work backwards to this cd. Once you get to this cd though, you'll know what I'm talking about.

0679422714|5.0|This carefully researched and detailed summary of Mao's life reveals him as one of the world's worst tyrants - causing the deaths of 70 million Chinese through torture, executions, mass starvation, inane economic decision-making, and politically-motivated military misadventures.  The only criticism I have of this important work is that it failed to communicate what made China vulnerable to a communist revolution; hopefully Chang (or someone else) will now provide an equally well-researched story of how Mao's successors managed to lead China out of the mess Mao created, after his death.<br /><br />Mao was an avid reader throughout his life, beginning at an early age, and he supported that interest by maneuvering to attend schools and evenutally becoming a teacher.  Mao decided at an early age that \\"I\\" was the focus of morality, that he did not have to benefit others, and that \\"do not kill,\\" \\"do not steal,\\" etc. were precepts meant only for self-preservation.  As a result, Mao took a cavalier attitude towards death, concluding that changing China required destruction, and that major loss of life was not a problem.<br /><br />Shortly after Mao began teaching he met the leader of the Chinese communist part, and began distribution its literature at age 27.  Soon Russian communists began supplying money and Mao was able to quit teaching.  Mao then lead a group living as bandits, focusing on those with land, commandeering buildings/homes for headquarters.  His actions created a backlash as a result of their savagery.  At 31, however, Mao was kicked out by the Russians, though accepted back at 32 - again as a local leader.  At the time, Chiang Kai-Shek was #2 in the Chinese communist party, though after going to Russia Chiang broke with the communists because he did not like what he saw.<br /><br />Constant scheming to increase power was Mao's main focus - torture and execution of those opposed became his trademark.  In these early years the Nationalist army was busy fighting Japan's incursions - nominally so did the Reds, but in reality they did little, preferring to let the Nationalists get shot at.  Controlling communications was a major part of Mao's scheming.<br /><br />Mao's \\"Long March\\" to the Chinese/Russian border to get Russian arms began in October of 1934.  The Nationalists did not attack (probably could have wiped Mao's forces out).  Chiang's plan was for the Reds to go into heretofore unmanageable bandit areas (had strongly resisted the Nationals), antagonize the locals, and then have the Nationals welcomed as they came to the local's rescue.  Another key reason Chiang did not attack was that he planned to trade this respite for Russia's releasing his son held hostage in Moscow.  Mao and his two co-plotters were carried on litters shielded from the sun and rain - sometimes the bearers had to climb up mountains on their knees.<br /><br /> Mao \\"repaid\\" his men's efforts by engaging in unneeded combat with Nationalists as a means of delaying Moscow-ordered meeting up with another much more powerful Red leader (Mao feared losing control - after eventually joining forces he began character-assassination and other actions that diminished the stature and strength of his competitor).  Prior to joining forces Mao's sojurn consumed almost 8 months (half pointless from a military or survival point of view, but critical to Mao's political maneuvering; had also lost his heavy weapons, had but 5 bullets/rifle) and lost 7/8ths of his force.<br /><br />Moscow's focus at this point was to use the Chinese Reds to hold back invading Japanese forces - Russia feared being next.  Unfortunately, an overly-exhuberant Mao disciple instead took the opportunity to capture Chiang, thanks to Chiang being double-crossed by one of his leaders.  (Chiang ultimately lost China due to subsequent actions of other moles in later combat with Mao's forces.)  Regardless, Moscow got Chiang to fund Mao's group and grant it legitimacy in return for his being freed.  Chou En-Lai then got a Mao supporter appointed head of p.r., leading to major positive publicity for Mao that greatly helped future recruiting and his foreign image.  (Edgar Snow's \\"Red Star,\\" reportedly full of Mao-invented myths of early struggles during the Long March and benevolent actions, was an example.)<br /><br />Another Red mole within Chiang's group helped start the Sino-Japanese war by falsely claiming a Japanese massacre in Southern China - thus relieving potential Japanese pressure on northern China (south-eastern Russia).  The war greatly weakened Chiang vs. Mao's forces - from 60:1 pre-war to 3:1 afterwards.  (Mao's forces did little against Japan.)<br /><br />Meanwhile, the favorable publicity brought many new members to Mao.  He required them to write down the thoughts and statements of others (informing on each), as a technique for supposedly identifying subversives who were then interrogated, tortured, and possibly executed.  (This technique was repeatedly used by Mao in his terror-reign, and quotas for executions etc. were often imposed.)  Mao also liked to use iinformation divulged in this way to hold over the heads of his officials as a threat if they crossed him.<br /><br />Mao then raised the grain tax to levels much greater than that under the Nationalists.  Other revenue-raising means including large-scale opium-growht, and selling the salt that had been stockpiled in his area.<br /><br />The U.S. provided respite for Mao after WWII as part of its efforts to stop the Chinese civil war.  General Marshall was misled regarding Mao's actions (also had a prior negative opinion of Chiang).  Forced Chiang to give Mao a four-month truce, providing Mao with the time to  solidify positions and receive substantial aid from Russia.  (North Korea also sent 200,000 men to help vs. Chiang.)  Mao repaid Russia by sending food, while allowing locals to starve.<br /><br />After the truce Chiang sent a leading Nationalist general to capture Mao's base.  The author is convinced, however, that this general was a Red mole; regardless, he managed to destroy his force by repeatedly splitting it and allowing Mao to chop up the smaller pieces.  Another mole general also lost a great number of men and large areas.  (Chiang displayed poor judgment - having heard these individuals were disloyal, seeing their poor performance, he did nothing.)  (Mao's historians had no interest in revealing the truth, since keeping reality secret made Mao look better militariliy.)  Still another Nationalist general did poorly - he was loyal, but his staff was riddled with moles.<br /><br />Korean War:  Stalin saw the potential for tying up massive U.S. resources, allowing him greater reign in Europe; also the ability to test new weapons and see how strong the U.S. really was.  Therefore, approved Mao and Kim's request.  (Mao saw the Korean War as an opportunity to purge/wipe-out large numbers of former Nationalist troops who had surrendered earlier.)  Mao dragged the conflict out an extra 18 months after Kim wanted out - wanted to extra Russian help to build arms industries.  (Russia, meanwhile, was seeing that the U.S. could not completely keep up with aircraft losses, and American political resolve to continue was weakening.)<br /><br />After the war, China gave 6.9% of its GNP to other nations in '73 - the highest levels ever seen in the world.  Meanwhile, Chinese peasants were starving, and prevented from moving to other areas.  Mao then collectivized agriculture because this made it easier to collect the harvests and to monitor production efforts.  Another purge was undertaken - this time of those with contacts within Russia.<br /><br />Offshore islands Quemoy and Matsu then came under Chinese bombardment.  Mao's intent was to get the U.S. to threaten use of nuclear weapons, and then use this to obtain further Russian support.  Eventually the strategy worked, and extensive technical assistance, a nucelar reactor, and a cyclotron were provided.  When Kruschev was threatened with a takeover, Mao prolonged giving his support to extract more military/weapons assistance.<br /><br />A second Chinese-manufactured Taiwan crisis then was initiated - this time to extort missile and submarine support from Russia.<br /><br />\\"Let 100 flowers bloom\\" said Mao, inviting dissent from those in the artist/intellectual community.  It was only a trap, and dissent received very limited publicity (posters) and those involved could not communicate with each other.  Another purge, with executions, quotas, and banishments to Manchuria.  Newspaper study groups were formed - taking up free time, and ensuring the indoctrination of even the illiterate.<br /><br />Food quotas were again increased, with \\"Potempkin fields\\" created by transferring ripe crops from a number of fields to a single plot.  The aim was not to fool Mao, but the cadre at other collectives.  Peasants were also used in forced labor at dams, stell mills, canals - and they had to provide their own food and tools.  Many large projects were never finished, and the steel produced in back-yard furnaces was virtually useless.  (The latter also resulted in demolishing countless homes and leveling forests to provide fuel for the furnaces.)<br /><br />Tibet was taken over.  Mao managed to make himself abhorrent to other communist leaders with statements about how China was prepared to sacrifice 300 million if need be; such statements probably totally undermined the influence he was trying to buy by donating food to other nations.  (He had hoped to take Stalin's place, and ultimately rule the world.)<br /><br />The Cultural Revolution began in '66 with students.  Classes were stopped (but students still fed), while Mao encouraged cleansing.  Every school suffered atrocities.  Fashionable dress, writers, and libraries also suffered.  The focus then shifted to faiding homes - confiscating money, jewelry, etc. and destroying much of China's historical monuments (eg. Confucious' home and museum were targeted - Confucious had declared that a \\"ruler must care for his subjects\\").  Finally, the uprising spread to attack Party leaders who had shown distate for Mao's extremism.  Many were exiled to labor camps, and replaced by army staff.  Normal schooling did not return for about ten years - after Mao died.<br /><br />Mao recognized at the end of his life that others were increasingly turning against him and his never-ending atrocities.

0553801503|3.0|I am addicted to George RR Martin's writing.  I think he currently is the best fantasy writer and A Song for Ice and Fire is the best ongoing fantasy series period.  That being said I think he does take a small step backwards with this book.  There is no doubt about Martin's writing skills and the world he can pull readers into is unique, but the organization of the overall plot/storyline of the series is lacking in A Feast of Crows.  How the storyline of the series has progressed after this book I can't exactly say, but it was fun to read. <br /> <br />My concern for the series then starts to echo many of the same problems I had with the latest Star Wars movies.  For me, both Martin and Lucas are able to create unique science fiction worlds, either visually or by writing, that pull the audience in.  However, without a carefully structured plot/storyline (plus for Lucas dialogue) for what purpose have we gone alone for the ride?  Just because Martin can write from 20 minor character's perspective should he when it leaves the 10 other major characters and storylines hanging? <br /> <br />I will definably eagerly await Martin's next book, and undoubtedly enjoy reading it.  However, I do think Martin lacked the structure to the main storylines in this book that was so beautifully apparent in the first three. <br /> <br />I would wait for this book to come out in paperback before buying it, and I also wouldn't pay to see Revenge of the Sith...... if I had more willpower. <br />
0393312836|5.0|So many passionate and intelligent reviewers have talked about this book, mostly discussing the conflicts of good vs. evil and man vs. the state. But no-one has discussed the unending source of Alex's fascinating personality. Is this modern icon of cool a demon or a damsel in distress? <br /> <br />On the surface, Alex seems to be a very macho personality -- a stereotypical teenage hoodlum slashing away with his razor, fighting like a demon with fisties and boots, a cross between the volatile Riff in WEST SIDE STORY and the rebellious James Dean in REBEL WITHOUT A CAUSE.  <br /> <br />Yet what makes Alex stand out from the pack is the languid, almost feminine personality he exhibits whenever not actually fighting in the street. Aside from his delight in violence, all his personality traits are \\"feminine.\\" He's dainty and fastidious in his dress, obsessed with cleanliness and neatness, sensitive to pleasant smells and extremely disdainful of sloppy people and dirty surroundings. Moreover, his Nadsat language contains a surprising amount of baby talk, the kind girls use. And he insists on describing himself as \\"luscious,\\" inviting us to imagine a fair damsel and not a foul brute.   <br /> <br />All this is very important in explaining why the reader cares so deeply about Alex, in spite of all the hateful and ugly crimes that lead to the \\"treatment\\" in prison and the ordeals that follow after. Really we are reading about a damsel in distress -- and we sympathize completely because the person being injected with drugs, tied in a chair, and so forth, responds in a way that's more endearingly pliant, submissive and helpless with each passing page.  <br /> <br />By the time Alex is relased from prison, our sympathies are entirely with the dazed and helpless damsel, who obviously needs rescuing. And the irony, of course, is that the ruggedly handsome writer who takes Alex in after his beating by police is the same man Alex injured earlier in the novel. Note that in the Kubrick movie version, writer F. Alexander is a cripple and a gibbering buffoon. But in the book, F. Alexander is strong, ruggedly handsome -- and a lot more masculine than Alex. It's very easy to visualize Alex as a forlorn damsel, a beauty in distress whose suffering awakens the protective side of this rugged knight's chivalrous nature. The reader is put off balance, drawn even more deeply into sympathy for Alex, who by now is gentle and meek and sweetly submissive, wearing the rugged writer's pajamas and all but eating out of his hand. <br /> <br />If Alex were a true damsel in distress, this would be the beginning of a love story, not a journey into further terror.  <br />(See the superb historical romance SOMEONE TO WATCH OVER ME by Lisa Kleypas.) But in this case the reader does not know what to expect, and these oddly tender images and emotions help to explain A CLOCKWORK ORANGE'S haunting and disturbing appeal.    <br /> <br />
0553801503|5.0|I am amazed at so many people rating the book as a one-star!  That's the lowest possible!  Surely it is just pique because it wasn't what they expected.  And what is the hurry to get this series finished?  I'd be glad if Martin wrote one book set in this world that I could read each year until my demise (or his).  Unlike Robert Jordan, whose books are premised on a grand finale battle, or quest books when the quest is fulfilled, what is the natural end of this series?  So far, many of the characters have seen their plans end in their own ruin.  Isn't this a lot like our world?  Are the negative reviewers out there envisioning some \\"and they lived happily ever after\\" ending for their favorite characters? Maybe Tirion will marry Dany or something like that! I very much enjoy more elaboration on the Ironmen, Dorne and Braavos.  Who cares if they don't lead to \\"progress,\\" in the sense of a traditional plot-line?  In this book, Martin shows even more sophistication in his knowledge of medieval culture; for one example only, look at how he handles the heraldry.  Those who don't know what \\"vairy\\" or a \\"bend\\" is are going to have to look it up in order to picture what he is talking about.  I like that, although maybe most don't. He has some memorable lines, such as a scholar who likes dead history more than living history because \\"dead history is written in ink, live history is written in blood.\\"  So true.  I'm not one who gives everything Martin wrote \\"5-stars\\".  As a matter of fact, I'm not wild about most of what GRRM wrote until he started this series.  This is his masterpiece, though.  I'd say to him, \\"make it as long as you want.  Don't worry about 'finishing' it.\\"  If I could make one criticism: more maps!  It is annoying to be reading about geographical locations that aren't found on the included maps!
B000002LKU|5.0|The year was 1990 I was in high school and a big Dire Straits fan, I happened to be vacationing in Singapore when I chanced on this casette and I have never looked back.  <br /> <br />It's difficult to describe the effect it has on you. It evokes memories and just makes you feel so good. I used to listen to it during my days at sea far away from home. Simply  brilliant. <br /> <br />The music is folksy with some bluegrass undertones now and then and the signature Mark Knopfler finger picking on his FS. <br /> <br />Buy it, borrow it or just record it you won't regret it.

6305428387|5.0|Christmas should be a time for reviewing Christmas things. Whatever...    Cool Runnings is one of the greatest films. It has something for everyone.    The story begins in November 1987 where Sprinter Derrice Bannock (Leon) is hoping to join the Olympics. However when he enters the trials to go, Junior Bevil (Rawle D. Lewis) trips up Derrice and Yul Brenner (Malik Yoba). Derrice is depressed until the Jamaican President talks about Bobsleds. Derrice gets the idea to get a Bobsled team. He gets his best friend, Sanka Coffie (Doug E. Doug), to join and former Bobsled Champion Irving Blitzer (John Candy) to be their coach. Eventually Junior Bevil and Yul Brenner join and everything starts there.     Reasons to enjoy this film:    1. It's Humour (Espically Sanka).    2. It is telling people about the first Jamaican Bobsled Team.     3. The acting is great from the main actors, Leon, Doug E. Doug, Rawle D. Lewis, Malik Yoba and John Candy.     4.The film length lasts for at least and hour and a half.    5. The soundtrack (Which I want to get).    However, this DVD doesn't contain any Special Features. Other than that a great DVD.    If you like the sound of this movie, then on the 30th December 2005, it will be on BBC 1 at 1:30pm-3:05pm. I guarantee you won't be disappointed.    Jake Potts
B000002AP1|5.0|Lets be frank. This album is almost an abuse of power. When Iggy says this is a violent mix, he means it. Its not worth bickering about the quality of the mix. At what point was this meant to happy, listenable music you can shove in your home stereo to placate your kids.      But is this just a cacophonous mess? Possibly.Is that the point? No. This album stands as one pf the best releases by the Stooges because of its rough ragged sound. This is music to go out and cause trouble by. So don't pay attention to folk whining about the loss of some heys in the background, and buy the album. Its worth it.
B00005JO1Y|2.0|Where do I start? I wanted so much to like Peter Jackson's vision of King Kong. After all, his Lord of the Rings films were staggeringly good, especially in the extended editions.  It's a rare director who can make a film that holds you to your seat for three to four hours. He did it easily. And so when I read that King Kong was going to be nearly one-third longer than its predecessors, I shrugged it off. \\"The longer, the better,\\" I thought.<br /><br />Boy, was I wrong.<br /><br />This latest--and entirely unnecessary--remake of the classic film fails in almost every way. Its self-indulgence is epic in scope, with the overall feel of a sugar addict starved for a week and released into a swimming pool of vanilla frosting. There's too much of just about everything. Too many slow motion shots with over-the-top looks of longing; too many close ups of Adrian Brody; to many fuzzy-looking brontosaurs; too much juggling; too many cars getting flipped over; and on and on.  Enough already.<br /><br />We only get to Skull Island after what feels like a ten-year voyage on a creaky iron schooner populated by caricatures: the first mate who quotes Conrad (oh brother); the \\"kid,\\" who is really a thirtysomething guy; the \\"Chinaman\\" who is a blatant, central-casting stereotype from the 1920's; the stoic Eastern European captain who can't seem to give the right commands; the \\"writer\\" who is both nerd and \\"stud\\"; and the damsel in distress who poses a lot, and whose eyes change color (you get to notice a lot of detail when you're bored out of your mind).<br /><br />This is a movie filled with visual cliches (the map swept from Jack Black's hands and fluttering out to sea is but one example) that are poorly executed even for cliches. This is a movie that makes the only redeeming character an ape, thus rendering the ending eminently unsatisfying. Our hero dies and all the awful human beings who populate this world live? Come on!<br /><br />Jackson can and now must do better than this.

B00005JNBQ|5.0|The first time my wife and I watched this we just didn't get it. We had to stop watching it.  After that, we caught different parts of the movie and it started to grow on us.<br /><br />Once you get through this; you'll understand why this is such a hilarious movie.  The one liners, the mannerisms, and just about everything that goes on.<br /><br />Watch it, then watch it about 5 more times and you'll understand.<br /><br />You might just want to catch a delicious bass too.
B000BMSTMS|4.0|Well, as most people expected, this would be a very interesting release from Korn. My own biggest question was whether or not they would still be creative enough w/o Head, and it shows that they lost some of their swagger.   <br /> <br />1 Twisted Transistor (10/10) - when it first was released, many people were probably thinking \\"WTF?\\", but this is a great song with a very catchy chorus and catchy verses as well. The bonus comes with a surprise 1-minute intro, an excellant choice by Korn. <br /> <br />2 Politics (9/10) - this one grasps you right in the beginning with the powerful guitar and strong words towards our government. Also one of the top 5 choruses of the album. <br /> <br />3 Hypocrites (8/10) - good overall track, but probably not as good as it's made up to be. Disappointing chorus. <br /> <br />4 Souvenier (9/10) - sounds like a classic-korn type of song from the beginning moments. Another good side of the album that seems to go unnoticed. <br /> <br />5 10 Or A 2-Way (6/10) - this shouldn't have been on this album or any other Korn album.  'nough said. <br /> <br />6 Throw Me Away (8/10) - a deep and dark song beginning with Jonathon's lyrics followed by a softer but creative chorus. <br /> <br />7 Love Song (7/10) - hard to discribe this one, just average, nothing special. <br /> <br />8 Open Up (8/10) - another slower song, but an overall good feel towards it. This one captured me, but to be honest with u, i'm not sure why. <br /> <br />9 Coming Undone (9/10) - #9 begins a string of 4 consecutive strong points of SYOTOS, much like how the album begins. Although containing a slower rhythm, it's one of the brightest parts. <br /> <br />10 Getting Off (9/10) - wow. hmm...not to fool anybody, but i wonder how Head would have felt about a song that is ACTUALLY about \\"getting off\\". This shows Korn's comical side once again, and displays another one one of Jon's \\"sexual\\" songs, following the likes of \\"Faget\\", \\"A.D.I.D.A.S.\\", and \\"Beat It Upright\\", just toname a few. <br /> <br />11 Liar (11/10) - easily the best song on the album, as well as the one that stands out the most. While a little on the short side (about 3:03 when the guitars cut off), it's still my obvious pick for single #2. <br /> <br />12 For No One (9/10) - another one that has that \\"classic\\" feel, nothin too wrong with this one. <br /> <br />13 Seen It All (7/10) - probably should have been the closer of the album, but what are ya gonna do? <br /> <br />14 Tearjerker (9/10) - while most will diss this one, mainly because we never see this side of Jonathon in an entire song, i like it and think it is a great finish to SYOTOS. Overall a great one if you're not in the headbanging mood. <br /> <br /> <br />Not the best overall effort from Korn. While my rating were generous, it is still far from perfection when considered as a whole. However, u have to cut them from slack i.e. the loss of Head.  He wasn't as big of a blow as what happened to Creed, Drowning Pool, or Adema, but it's more than nothing. The 3 bonus tracks on the limited edition are all great songs, i recommend picking that up.
0553801503|4.0|There are about a zillion reviews of this book that seem to indicate that \\"nothing happens\\".  That couldn't be further than the truth.  This is the quiet lull I was expecting after \\"A Storm of Swords\\", the pause before the next thunderbolt.  My cheif complaint about the last book was that it had too many big surprises, earth shattering events, and a lot of major character deaths as well.  This book is the aftermath, and aptly titled,  just look at how many times he mentions corpses laying about, ruined castles and towns it is indeed a feast for crows. <br /> <br />As far as 'nothing happening\\" look at the set up for future events, it's all being laid out and it's going to be awesome.  There were a lot of complaints about Cerseis's inclusion as a POV character, but that maegi's prophecy explains everything she's done in previous books and hmmmm I think we know who the young queen who will supplant her will really be, and which brother will really stangle her (one hand or no), or who knows maybe not, but speculation drives this series and we get plenty new opportunities to do just that.   <br /> <br />Something tells me when get the other half of this book (I personally could have waited for the whole thing myself, but I'll take what I can get!) a lot of the negetive folks will shut there holes. <br /> <br />Rock on George, your still the man!
076790592X|5.0|I felt that Tuesday's with Morrie was a very moving story.  As I read more into the story and as the story went on, I felt myself feeling with Morrie and those around him.  I also realized that the lesson he taught each Tuesday made we want to continue reading.  Most of these lessons I can use in my life and encourage others with a dying friend or family memeber just as Morrie coached Mitch.  This book was a requirement for a college course, but I find it is a requirement for living life to the fullest.
B00000JPYQ|5.0|The guitar solo that Michael Schenker plays in the song \\"Rock Bottom\\" on this live recording is in my opinion THE BEST ROCK GUITAR SOLO OF ALL TIME !!!<br /><br />There is so much emotion and flawless lead guitar playing put into this song that it makes me cry when I listen to it!!<br /><br />Schenker is AMAZING !
0441172717|5.0|This is by far the best book i've ever read. Even if you don't like sci-fi you should still give it a shot. This book is extremely rich, it has so many philosophical implications and so many cultural and political things that are well  blended. The plot is like nothing i've ever seen, so much better than a lot of books out there....... yeah, the book is a little hard to understand and sometimes you have to read a chapter twice to truly understand what's going on, but it's worth it.
0060920432|5.0|Flow - a state that people are so involved in an activity that nothing else seems to matter. <br /> <br />The entire book is about how to achieve that state in everything from exercising to using it to achieve successful relationships, and to making life a complete flow experience. Flow can also be seen as another way to achieve happiness.  <br /> <br />The book really changed some of my thoughts and that's why I think so highly of it. It's a well written book with many good notions. It is also some what motivational though it is not intended to be.
156895557X|5.0|I really like this book because it's a true story of an old man who is facing death. After reading this book, it makes think of people around me and treasure them more because I don't like to be like Morrie and his father. They never get to know each other. This book reminds us that not every one think about death or repare for death. We usually think of vacation or make plans, but death is something that we never thought about it. Anyway, This is a very good book that every one should read to understand more about life.

B000068TPN|5.0|From the casting to the dialogue to the weapons, uniforms and equipment, We Were Soldiers should be on every list of the all-time best war movies. I'm an Army veteran (didn't serve in Vietnam but did see the Gulf War) and I appreciated the realism of the combat scenes, the training and preparation, the leaders' devotion to their troops and the depiction of the tactical decisions by the commanders on both sides.  I thought this was superior to every recent war movie, including Saving Private Ryan, with the exception of Black Hawk Down - and it's the equal of that one.  <br />Among the things I particularly liked was the fact that the home front was shown but not excessively; the bond between the Air Cav Huey pilots and the grunts; the recognition that the timely application of air support saved the battalion from being overrun; the \\"other side\\" is shown in a realistic manner, without condescension or caricature, but mainly without \\"PC\\" revisionism either (the best war movies, like Battle of Britain and Tora Tora Tora, are usually the ones that do this); and the extremely realistic depiction of close-quarter combat, wounds, cameraderie and bravery under fire. This movie has the most excruciatingly realistic simulation of a burn casualty I've ever seen and really brings home the sacrifices made by our troops. <br />The acting and performances are great. Mel Gibson is outstanding as LTC Moore, even to the accent, and looks and acts like a cavalry squadron CO in his every mannerism, expression and speech. I can't praise enough Sam Elliott's portrayal of the hard-as-nails Command Sgt. Major fighting his last war - perfect in every way, and he has some of the best dialogue in the movie (\\"Can't take any pictures down there, Sonny\\" and \\"Time comes I need a rifle, there'll be plenty lying around, Sir\\").   <br />Also getting high marks for realism from me are the air strikes (especially the effects of the 20mm from the Skyraiders), the reaction of the Air Cav pilot when berated for leading Medevacs into a hot LZ, the feeling evoked by the troops all gathering at the buses that will take them, ultimately, to combat, the scenes of Gibson praying with his children and his lieutenant, the realistic calls for artillery and air support, etc - I could go on forever. One of the best scenes is when the Hueys are returning for another ammo/wounded run while the air strikes are going on and two fighters can be seen through the helo cockpit, pulling up from their bombing runs. <br />Of course, this being produced by Hollywood, it's inevitable to have at least a few hokey scenes, even with Hal Moore himself as a technical advisor. The home front scenes of delivering the casualty notices seem contrived (I agree with the 'Nam vet who said the notices probably wouldn't have arrived during the battle) - it's hard to believe that the Army gave the families no support whatsoever, not even sending a chaplain or officer to notify the next of kin who are living on a military base, but that may be the way it is in Moore's book (I haven't read it yet). Gibson's/Moore's return home also is unlikely - that he'd just sort of walk in the door unannounced, more likely the unit would have come back and everyone would know when their husbands were returning. Also agree with an earlier review that the final scene with the NVA colonel almost tenderly handling a tiny American flag is pretty improbable and smacks of the only real case of \\"PC\\" in the movie. The final American scene, with the horde of reporters emerging from a CH-47 to cluster around Joe also is unlikely - even if the artillery round that goes off is \\"friendly,\\" if it lands that close and there's still a need for artillery fire, it's unlikely that the Army would have choppered a crew of reporters into the area. It would have been more realistic if different helicopter crews, not just Snake and Too Tall, were shown, giving the impression that these two pilots were the only ones in the 7th Cav's aviation squadron who continued to make runs into the area. The last part of the final charge is also pretty hokey - doubtful that the helicopters would have timed their appearance just at the moment when the US troops appeared lined up at the crest of the high ground (a very bad tactical move by a commander who was shown to have exercised very good tactical judgement up to then), or that they would have hovered just off the ground to fire when the enemy had heavy machine guns in the area. These are minor annoyances, however, in an otherwise outstanding movie that's a tribute to the combat veterans who fought in Vietnam.
078681859X|5.0|I listened to the unabridged audio version of this book and loved it. Well narrated, the pace is quick and keeps your interest. <br /> <br />The magic is believable and has many quirks that keep it in bounds. The djinni is hilarious and Nathaniel is good enough to gain your sympathy. <br /> <br />The scond book is just as good and I can't wait for the third.
B00005JK8K|2.0|I was excited about this movie when I saw the trailer in the theater. Since watching it on the big screen and buying it, I'm more dissatisfied every time I watch it. At first I appreciated some of the large battle scenes, with their sweeping views of the advancing Marines and the Japanese trenches and gun emplacements, and the use of correct weapons, vehicles, tanks and aircraft (even if the F6Fs are computer-generated). However, I judge most war movies by realism (I'm a 24-year retired Army veteran) and this one lacks it in key areas.  <br />Of course, the Navajo code talkers are what make this movie unique and are the basis for its whole premise. Great care is exercised to prevent them from falling into enemy hands (the whole premise of the movie) so the code cannot be tortured out of them. However, the Marines then go out of their way to place them in the most exposed, dangerous positions. Enders violates his orders by allowing Ben to pose as a Japanese soldier, placing him in a situation where he is in the greatest danger of capture (why couldn't they have just called in artillery or air to take care of those positions?).  <br />As a plot device, the director wants the code talkers to save the day by passing critical information to the naval fire support teams. However, there is no reason to send calls for naval gunfire, artillery or air support in code, since they are only divulging the enemy's location, not friendlies'. In fact, that would only delay getting the needed support. Also, anyone in the platoon who could read a map and send coordinates on a radio could have sent the calls for fire - didn't have to be done only by the code talker, yet everyone seemed to think only he could do it.  <br />There is far, far too much use of fire in artillery explosions, a regression to earlier war movies that I thought today's directors had moved beyond (unless caused by incendiary shells or secondary explosions, very little flame is produced by artillery explosions, which do damage mainly by blast and shrapnel) to the point of being a distraction. Another regression is a few appearances of the \\"Hollywood hundred-round magazines\\", although at least the movie shows guys reloading. The Marine column taken under fire by the Japanese artillery at the end of the movie never attempts to disperse, move off the road or take cover. Again, they can only be saved by a radio call from codetalker Ben, when any of the guys in the column under attack could and should have called for fire or air support themselves, instead of getting killed for 15 minutes while the remains of the recon platoon fought over the radio. Same goes for the time that their own unit comes under friendly artillery fire. On several other occasions, the unit appears to exercise poor tactical judgement, mainly for the director's purpose of allowing more Marines to get killed so as to show the \\"horrors of war\\". Any unit that was attritted in combat as much as Enders' was would have been pulled off the line, not required to fight on with only half a dozen men.  <br />It's also not clear what is the actual mission of the unit - is it a recon unit (as seems to be the case) or is it part of a main force infantry company (since they are in the main assault earlier in the film)? And where are their officers? The highest ranking guy in the unit appears to be the gunnery sergeant.  <br />Accuracy of weapons and uniforms is a strong point of this film (even to having Enders use the earlier M1928 Thompson SMG with a drum magazine in the opening 1942 Guadalcanal scenes) and there is some riveting close-quarter combat (sure wish they had let the gunnery sergeant USE that trench-sweeper shotgun he carried). Too bad they could find (or afford) only two tanks to support the main attack, but it was great to see the Sherman and M5 Stuart in action.  <br />I liked most of the performances - perhaps Cage's wasn't one of his best (he does seem to overact here sometimes) but I wouldn't rate it asbad as some of the earlier reviews (but I haven't seen that many of his other movies). The other main characters are pretty good, and it was a nice touch making the \\"gunny\\" have a Scandinavian or whatever accent. This film would have benefited greatly from a good ex-military technical advisor or two and/or a director who listened to them.
B0002ZMITY|4.0|I have no idea why this movie just cracks me up, but it does. Whenever I'm bummed out for no good reason, I turn it on and watching him dance like a dork in that tiny car cracks me up.  He's the biggest goof but thinks he's wicked cool.  <br /> <br />Take it for the fluff entertainment it is and if you like this sort of thing (I normally don't), then enjoy it. If not, pass it by and get something else.

1573223026|4.0|In his latest book `A Long Way Down', Nick Hornby tackles the taboo subject of suicide (at least in popular mainstream fiction) with empathy, chutzpah, wit and humour. He tells the bitter-sweet tale through the eyes of four very different strangers.  <br /> <br />Introducing Martin, JJ, Maureen and Jess.  <br /> <br />Martin is a disgraced TV personality who is divorced, broke and is recently out of prison after serving time for having sex with an under aged girl. JJ (an American in London) is a frustrated musician turned pizza-delivery man and has been through two recent heart wrenching break-ups, one with his girlfriend and the other with his rock band. Maureen is a middle-aged woman who leads a lonely and monotonous life taking care of her severely disabled son. Jess has behavioural problems and is an angst-filled troubled teenager with a gutter cum motor mouth.  <br /> <br />The story begins on New Year's Eve atop Toppers House in London, a popular suicide venue. Martin has cut through the barbed wired fence and is sitting on the ledge in contemplation. He is interrupted by a shuffling and awkward Maureen who wants to borrow his ladder to get to the other side of the fence. Soon afterwards, JJ (with undelivered pizzas) and Jess arrive on the roof. Meanwhile, Jess gets highly aggressive and threatens to jump while the other three, forgetting their own suicide plans, try to physically restrain her. Finally, she agrees not to jump if the rest accompany her to look for her ex-boyfriend, Chas, who broke off with her without giving her an adequate reason despite her constantly stalking and harassing the poor guy. Shelving their suicide plans and deciding on the next eventful day (Valentine's Day), the foursome walk 'a long way down' the staircase of Toppers House to go to a party that Chas is supposedly attending. <br /> <br />What follows is a series of funny twists and turns. Jess turns out to be the daughter of a Junior Minister of Education and pictures of them get splashed all over the tabloids. They try to profit from the press by selling their fictitious story of abandoning their suicide plans because they saw an angel atop Toppers House. As events unfold, the reader gets to know the characters and their feelings more intimately. It turns out that Maureen just needs a break from her mundane life and is craving for newness and change. Martin finds it hard to live with the humiliation and is bemoaning the loss of his job, wife and kids. Jess feels misunderstood by her parents and is trying hard to cope and live a normal life after her elder sister who ran away from home and disappeared years ago. JJ is trying hard to come to grips with reality that he is not a gifted musician and that he'll be just another average person throughout his life.        <br /> <br />Valentine's Day arrives and they meet again at the roof of the Toppers House. However, this time, their lives are turned upside down when they witness another person commit suicide causing them to re-evaluate their own lives and find meaning. The story winds down as they decide to support each other as they become an unexpected but somewhat strong resource in each others' life.  <br /> <br />More book summaries at compelligence.com/bookblog
076790592X|5.0|Overall I thought that this was a good book.  I would not have normally read this book but I am glad that I did.  Morrie is able to communicate his feelings in a way that only a man who knows his death is near can.  Because of his unique view on life Morrie is able to make the most of the time he has left and share what he has learned through his life experiences.  There are many valuable life lessons all throughout this book.  If you want to read a book that will touch your life and make you see things in a different light you should read Tuesdays With Morrie.

0425170349|3.0|Fans of Clancy know his novels vary a great deal in quality.  Rainbow six is not one of the best.  A lot of action?  Sure.  Suspensful conclusion?  Of course.  But the book overall has the feeling of a summertime blockbuster with more action than substance.  Often there is interesting character growth and philosophical quandaries in his novels.  However, this novel is not very political and attempts at human drama come off as sappy, sentimental, and unrealistic.
B0007GAERG|3.0|For those who check out reviewers' comments to get a better idea of an album's strengths or weaknesses, (sometimes the selected sound snippets just aren't enough)you've probably learned by now that it's a dicey proposition, at best. Try reading reviews for progressive music, where you'll find more insightful prose.  <br /> <br />For uber-popular artists like Mariah Carey, you gotta wade through too much dreck from the laughably ignorant, who need no pointing out, as their dumb comments proudly proclaim to all the world, \\"Yes....all this, AND I'm allowed to breed.\\"  <br /> <br />For those who think calling Mariah Carey a Moo Cow and denigrating her because of her age: you're not funny.

B00001OH7P|5.0|The Rise And Fall Of Ziggy Stardust And The Spiders From Mars (1972.), David Bowie's fifth studio album<br /><br />As the 1970's progressed, David Bowie became recognised as a music legend. However, in the early part of his career, Bowie was much less known and hadn't yet broken through into the mainstream, even though he'd released classic albums such as 'Hunky Dory'. This all changed in 1972 with the release of the 'Ziggy Stardust' concept album. David Bowie's newly adopted persona in the album transformed him into a famous star overnight. Over time, David Bowie's glam rock styled 'Ziggy Stardust' has been hailed as his ultra-definitive album and perhaps as his greatest. So does 'Ziggy Stardust' live up to its great reputation?<br /><br />'Ziggy Stardust' is unlike any other album I've heard. Even though the style is totally glam rock, a trend which was very popular in music in the early 70's, the concept around the album and the whole transformation Bowie made himself within the work is what makes it pretty unique. The concept of the album aside, all of the tracks on the album hold up individually in their own right. There are plenty of great concept albums such as 'The Wall' by Pink Floyd or 'Tommy' by The Who which require you to listen to the album as a whole to 'get' all of the tracks in context; with 'Ziggy Stardust', there is no such problem and all of the songs can be well appreciated as unrelated songs. This is why plenty of the songs, such as 'Starman' and 'Suffragette City' achieved popular status and plenty of radio play. Bowie and his backing band capture the glam style brilliantly. Mick Ronson is one of the main stars of the album with some legendary inspired solos plus the piano intertwines on some of the songs are played by him. The music on the album has a crisp and fresh sound to it and hasn't aged at all. You can tell the music is 70's glam but at the same time it never sounds dated.<br /><br />In the past ten or fifteen or so years, the David Bowie album series has undergone a number of remasters. The first of these was the 1990 remaster series which features the original 11 track album and bonus tracks including songs 'Velvet Goldmine' and the single 'John I'm Only Dancing'. Since then, an enhanced series of Bowie albums has become available and this is the version you're most likely to find on the CD shop shelf. These new versions have awesome sound quality for the original albums and come with well constructed booklets of lyrics however the enhanced CD's have no bonus tracks featuring like the earlier version. This is a shame because the remasters are excellent and it seems strange that they miss off extras that feature on an earlier version!<br /><br />The album is the epic saga of a space rock stars ascent to superstardom and his subsequent fall. 'Five Years' gets the album going; a footstep sounding drum opening leads into a great piano driven song. Bowie gives a pleading vocal performance about the end of the world drawing near. The orchestral background and whirlwind finish is classic. The glam style then truly kicks in with 'Soul Love'. This is one of the really catchy songs off the album, with some great driving guitar work from Mick Ronson and a great saxophone interlude. Bowie is a more than capable saxophone player and it is probably his most underrated musical ability. 'Moonage Daydream' for me is the height of this great album. This spacey sounding song rocks in great style. Epic, moody choruses contrasted by punchy verses make this song great and Mick Ronsons futuristic sounding exit solo is phenominal. 'Starman', another one of Bowie's most famous songs follows. This is another great, catchy song with a space theme. To finish the first side of the album is 'It Ain't Easy'. A good song, although probably the weakest on the album - ironically Bowie didn't write this one! The song has a killer chorus with wailing guitars.<br /><br />'Lady Stardust' then 'Star' open up the second half of thealbum. Both songs are great glam rocking songs; 'Lady Stardust' is especially great with a great piano melody carrying the tune. Another famous track, 'Hang On To Yourself' is next. This is a great fast paced song with a great guitar riff and inspired 'C'mon C'mon' chorus. Then, who could forget the opening guitar sequence of 'Ziggy Stardust'. Bowie sings the story of the rise and fall of the rock n' roll star; another one of the albums highlights. 'Suffragette City' follows; another classic glam sounding song with a driving riff and a really cool chorus. However, after all of these pretty upbeat songs, the album closes on a more mellow and darker note in the 'Rock n' Roll Suicide'. Lyrically brilliant, this acoustic starting song builds to an emphatic climax before finishing with the grand sound of a string orchestra.<br /><br />The 'Ziggy Stardust' album immortalised David Bowie. This, coupled with his famous 'Ziggy Stardust' tour which followed are some of the highlights of his great career. This album is up there with his other great works such as 'Hunky Dory' and 'Aladdin Sane'. Bowie's glam rock phase was perhaps his most successful era and this masterpiece has it all. If your looking to start a Bowie album collection, this is the work to begin with.<br /><br />MY RATING: 9.5/10g songs; 'Lady Stardust' is especially great with a great piano melody carrying the tune. Another famous track, 'Hang On To Yourself' is next. This is a great fast paced song with a great guitar riff and inspired 'C'mon C'mon' chorus. Then, who could forget the opening guitar sequence of 'Ziggy Stardust'. Bowie sings the story of the rise and fall of the rock n' roll star; another one of the albums highlights. 'Suffragette City' follows; another classic glam sounding song with a driving riff and a really cool chorus. However, after all of these pretty upbeat songs, the album closes on a more mellow and darker note in the 'Rock n' Roll Suicide'. Lyrically brilliant, this acoustic starting song builds to an emphatic climax before finishing with the grand sound of a string orchestra.    The 'Ziggy Stardust' album immortalised David Bowie.

B000BW7QWW|5.0|I must start of by saying I am in disbelief at the poor performance Serenity had at the Box Office, but I'm all kinds of pleased to see that it is the #1 selling DVD on Amazon(at the current moment). Honestly the movie on its own merits deserves 4 1/2 stars do to minor plot holes and some ackward character development. That said, this DVD deserves 6 stars (if that is even possible) do to the shear fact that I damn near laughed my self in to a coma when I saw the Outtakes reel. Nathan Fillon should be a stand up comedian, but I'm damn glad he can act cause this movie wouldn't be the same without him. If you have even an ickling of humor in your body, or you like a good action flick then pick this DVD up while you still have a chance. If I'm lieing let the almighty lord strike me down right now!.... So the crew can string me up to the ship like a hood-ornament of course.....HAHAHAHA!!!....Oh great another Coma!!!
B000BW7QWW|5.0|Joss Whedon is an absolute genius! He created in my opinion the three best TV shows in history (Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Angel, and Firefly) and now he has created one of the greatest films I have ever seen in 'Serenity'. The witty dialogue, incredible character relationships, and amazing action sequences are only the tip of the iceberg for what only can be described as cinematic bliss. Please buy this DVD and support the movie so that we fans may luck out and get a sequel!!!
B000BCKFWK|5.0|How my ratings work:<br />5 - I really liked/loved it<br />4 - I liked it<br />3 - Could've been better/worth a look<br />2 - Just didn't live up to the potential<br />1 - Simply awful<br /><br />Sin City is one of the best comic book adaptations to come along in a while. I couldn't beleive how accurate it was to the books. It's also one of the most visually stunning films ever! The casting is pitch perfect, the entire cast does a great job. But Mickey Rourke steals the show as Marv. He's the ultimate street thug who'll take down anyone who get's in his way (and does half the time) to get his revenge. A must see for Frank Miller Fans, comic book fans, Robert Rodriguez fans, or people who just love good movies.
0307276902|1.0|I picked up this book once I heard Oprah raving about how great it is. I think it's the most boring book I've ever read. I read what other's had to say about this book and everyone raves about it like Oprah did. I just couldn't get involved enough in the character to care about his struggle with drug addiction. Sorry, but that's just my opinion.
B000B7BRMM|4.0|Diana, as always, captivates with her renditions of these Christmas favorites. Her take on \\"Christmas Time Is Here\\" is especially wonderful. I was disappointed, though, by the lack of any of her chosen Christmas songs containing reference to Christ. Still, I am sure this is a CD I will play every year.
1400079179|3.0|It was time to see what the big deal was. For ages, all I've been hearing about is this book, and after some procrastinating I finally settled down to read what was adored by some and reviled by others, to decide for myself how good Dan Brown's famous work really was.<br /><br />Professor Robert Langdon (previously appearing in Brown's earlier novel \\"Angels and Demons\\") is called into the Louvre Museum by the French authorities - acting under the orders of the intimidating Captain Fache - to answer some questions about a murder. The highly esteemed curator of the museum, Jacques Sauniere, has been found shot to death in the most bizarre crime-scene imaginable. He is found spread-eagled, naked and with messages scrawled around and on him (in both blood and florescent ink), all of which is his own doing, and which Langdon believes is a series of cryptic clues that point to the killer.<br /><br />However, unbeknownst to Langdon he is the police's main suspect, though it is not until he is joined by French cryptologist Sophie Neveu (beautiful, confident and green-eyed, of course), that he realises the trouble he's in. From this meeting stems the discovery of several ingenious clues concealed by the dead man that take the two of them on a whirl-wind treasure hunt in search of - what else? - the Holy Grail. On the run from both the authorities and sinister agents of a church-sect, Langdon and Neveu gradually begin to fully understand the importance of the quest they have found themselves on.<br /><br />Thrown into a big melting pot of intrigue and conspiracy are factors such as the Knights Templar, Leonardo da Vinci, Isaac Newton, the Mona Lisa, Goddess cults, Mary Magdalene, the Priory of Scion, the Freemasons - heck, according to Brown even Walt Disney was in on the cover-up. This range of clues and hints have Langdon and Neveu delving into the depths of history, manuscripts and symbology as well as racing around Paris and London from one pit stop to the next, much like contestants in \\"The Amazing Race\\". However, the treasure hunt that Brown creates for his characters is undeniably clever in its instigation of both ancient and ultra-modern implements, and the clues themselves have double, even triple meanings, sustaining the two seekers almost to the end of the novel. It may take a stretch of credibility that a respectable (and innocent!) professor would take a complete stranger's advice in fleeing a crime-scene and remain on the run, but once the ball gets rolling it's one heck of a roller coaster ride.<br /><br />But the leaps of logic aren't the only thing that has caused criticism. During the course of Langdon and Neveu's adventure, the core-conspiracy that lies at the heart of the story (that is, the humanity and blood-line of Jesus Christ) is explored by establishing certain \\"facts\\" shared between characters in discussions that are meant to strengthen - even prove - the existence of a church cover-up. The problem is that these facts are seldom correct. One could take the `hey, it's just fiction', stance and that's fair enough, but Brown seems to expect the reader to take his information as truth and even provides a disclaimer at the beginning of the novel that declares a series of \\"Facts\\", including \\"all descriptions of artwork, architecture, documents and secret rituals in this novel are accurate.\\" This statement, to put it simply, is not true.<br /><br />I'm no historian, but even I could spot gaps in his research, including an incorrect date on the finding of the Dead Sea Scrolls. And when information is lacking, Brown simply fills in the gaps as it suits him; as when he quotes the Gospel of Philip: \\"Christ loved her (Mary Magdalene) more than all the disciples and used to kiss her often on the mouth.\\" Don't quote me on this, but I believe in actuality, the original document is damaged and the word \\"mouth\\" indecipherable as a result. The word *could* be mouth...but it could also be feet, forehead, hand, cheek or any otherpart of the body.<br /><br />These are only two examples off the top of my head; rest assured there are many more and a simple internet-search will access many websites that highlight other moments of fabrication or subversion in Brown's research. Of course, most readers will understand this for themselves as they read through the book; yet the problem lies with readers who are happy to take Brown's word for it all. Rest assured, \\"The Da Vinci Code's\\" historical context needs to be read with a grain of salt.<br /><br />And yet this is not the end of the controversy. There are claims that the book takes a negative view of the Catholic Church, demonising its teachings and its people. Although I can see the point of this claim, I also believe there may be some overreaction at work. On the whole Brown steers clear of anti-religious hysteria. Although that may sound like an odd thing to say considering the most blatant villain is a religious fanatic, Brown is careful to accommodate the existence of faithful, decent and worthy religious individuals and organisations. Personally, I found it more offensive that the afore-mentioned villain is portrayed as an albino, with the suggestion that this condition is the cause of his near-insane persona. And the fact that he is described as having red eyes is truly irritating; albinos do NOT have red eyes - that is a complete myth; they usually have grey or green eyes.<br /><br />The length of time I spent in this review on discussing the controversy surrounding the book rather than the book itself may be an indicator of where its popularity truly lies! I for one, found \\"The Da Vinci Code\\" to be a good, exciting, interesting read and I enjoyed it. However, it can certainly *not* be described as \\"literature\\", and is possibly not entirely deserving of the worldwide hype and publicity that it's been receiving. Though the conspiracy theory it deals with is a legitimate one (and by that I mean it is not simply invented by the author, but was a theory, however flimsy, in existence before publication), many of its historical facts and figures are hopelessly incorrect and/or misleading. Though the two lead protagonists are pleasant enough people, they are can hardly be considered three-dimensional characters (though again, they technically don't really need to be) and the action-sequences are suspenseful and nerve-wracking. And despite some who will undoubtedly take Brown's claims for granted, surely it can only be considered a good thing if some readers who would otherwise not do so find themselves looking more into history as a result of reading his book.or any other part of the body.  <br /> <br />These are only two examples off the top of my head; rest assured there are many more and a simple internet-search will access many websites that highlight other moments of fabrication or subversion in Brown's research.

B000BKJ78U|1.0|Duped again!  I saw the original artwork on the cover and RAN to the shelf at my local big-box-mart with excitement thinking that we FINALLY had the ORIGINAL, un-edited trilogy.  There was nothing written on the box to confirm that though, so I was naturally skeptical.  I came here to check it out and I was right.  Same Special Edition set that was released just recently, only without the bonus disc.  Lame Lame Lame.  In fact I looked around for the other set and it was marked down to the same price as this one.  Crazy.  Makes no sense at all to the fans to even consider buying this.  I was hoping to finally unplug the old Laserdisc player and unload some of those gigantic discs.  Hear our pleas George!
0694525499|5.0|American Gods is one of those novels that is incredibly ambitious, but you don't realize it until you are lost in the middle somewhere, the mundane world far behind, and your mind reeling.  You have a hero named Shadow - in jail because he took the fall for a robbery that his wife was involved in.  He's just been doing his time, learning from his cell mate Low Key - waiting to get out and home.  His wife is waiting.  His job, working at a body building \\"farm\\" for his best friend - is waiting.  Did I mention Shadow is huge?<br /><br />A few days before he is to be released, Shadow gets a call to visit the warden, and from there - anything goes.  Meet Mr. Wednesday, an enigma unto himself. Every character is a story, every story stretches back to the roots of our country - the very things that make America - well - American.<br /><br />Ever wonder why you can't seem to turn away from fifty signs that lead you to the world's largest ball of string?  Why is it not odd that you can drive through Illinois and make your way from Cairo to Paris in a couple of hours?  What happens when you leave your homeland and go to a new world, but you still believe in the Gods you left behind?  How do Leprechauns get their gold?<br /><br />This isn't a synopsis.  I'm not going to give away the surprises and insights that make this a wonderful novel.  It has Aristotle's three parts - the conclusion of which is complete and satisfying.  It has some romance, some magic, some philosophy - even some history.  It has all the appeal of Kerouac's ON THE ROAD - but with a major twist.<br /><br />Don't be surprised if you buy this, and then find yourself wanting to sit in the car JUST A LITTLE LONGER to hear what happens next.  The narrator, George Guidall, comes off at first as maybe too old - maybe too quiet and reserved to narrate Neil Gaiman.  Then, before you know it, you can see those characters talk - and the voices are distinct - clear and well-conceived.  An amazing production of a wonderful novel.  Go buy it.duction of a wonderful novel.  Go buy it. <br />
0307276902|2.0|I didn't read the reviews for fear of spoilers.  It was hyped as \\"a book you can't put down\\" and that \\"the reader never knows where he's going to end up next\\".  Well guess what?  About 20 pages in, he ends up in a rehab clinic and that's where he stays for the rest of the book.  Great. <br /> <br />A mix between an ABC After School Special and 'One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest' minus the horrible staff, I felt cheated.  I would have rather read a story of Frey's pre-rehab days lived fix to fix than go through the 'When a Man Loves a Woman' trip again. <br /> <br />There is nothing novel about this novel, save the extreme state of James's addiction and stubborness...and his bizarre use of capital letters and lack of basic punctuation, which often confused the stretches of dialogue. <br /> <br />I applaud him as a person, not as an author.  What could he possibly write about now that his memoir is accomplished - and what story could survive his lack of basic punctuation? <br /> <br />I recommend this book only to the easily shocked.
0553588486|5.0|This story works well, despite the many different perspectives telling the tale. Martin does not fall into the \\"trap\\" of feeling like he must save his protagonists from the slights, pitfalls, backstabbing, and unfair natures of those around them. People are portrayed as human, and with all the foibles of humanity. Loyalties and morals fight alongside and against each other, and at many different layers.<br /><br />That this is a \\"fantasy\\" book is without a doubt. However, if your definition of \\"fantasy\\" is one that relies on dragons, wizards, magic swords, elves, dwarves, orcs, and a war of good against evil (akin to a different author with the \\"R.R.\\" initials), then this is not your sort of fantasy. This story sets place in a \\"low-fantasy\\" world, where dragons USED to fly, giants USED to terrorize the world, and the gods USED to talk with men. That being said, Martin gives you glimpses of the supernatural that still holds on at the fringes of the \\"civilized\\" world.<br /><br />The only thing that I don't really like is the lack of a more comprehensive \\"world map\\", seeing that roughly 1/5 - 1/6 of the story takes place on a different continent.<br /><br />Still, at this price ($3.99 NEW), you should pick up the book.
0312323859|5.0|I didn't think it was possible, because I loved Something Borrowed, but Something Blue is actually a better book, and ultimately more satisfying. It has one of the best endings I've read, very touching.  <br /> <br />It's amazing too that she his able to take a truly hard to like character, spoiled pretty girl Darcy, and actually make the reader care for her. I loved this book, and look forward to her next. <br /> <br />
0553579908|4.0|I purchased the first book after reading a review of \\"Crows\\" (Book 4) a recent copy of Time Magazine. I liked that book, and decided to purchase the second in the series. <br /> <br />Martin does continue in the same tone as before. The story does bog down slightly in the middle, but does continue onward (if only slightly ploddingly). Martin likes to do a bit of a \\"Rashomon\\" treatment of some of his characters, viewing them from many different angles as he cycles through the different \\"protagonists\\". (While this sort of writing can endanger a story's plotline, Martin works this system of writing quite well). <br /> <br />That this is a \\"fantasy\\" book is without a doubt. However, if your definition of \\"fantasy\\" is one that relies on dragons, wizards, magic swords, elves, dwarves, orcs, and a war of good against evil (akin to a different author with the \\"R.R.\\" initials), then this is not your sort of fantasy. This story sets place in a \\"low-fantasy\\" world, where dragons USED to fly, giants USED to terrorize the world, and the gods USED to talk with men. That being said, Martin gives you glimpses of the supernatural that still holds on at the fringes of the \\"civilized\\" world. What is different from the first book is the greater influence of magic as it seems to seep (potentially to later POUR) back into the world. <br /> <br />As with the first volume, a more comprehensive \\"world map\\", seeing that roughly 1/5 - 1/6 of the story takes place on a different continent.
0156027321|5.0|At first glance, the story may seem to move a little slow, but give it a chance and you won't regret it! There are a lot of memorable quotes from the novel and the ending will leave you pratically dumbstruck. After finishing the book it left me with a smile on my face. I couldn't help but almost laugh out loud! The main character, Pi, is quite smart and witty. A really great novel. Don't miss out!  (...)

Still, A good movie to get Thinks started, If your interested for the first time. Any Way 5.5/5!

B000063COX|5.0|I am a huge Iron Maiden fan and I gotta say that I can't understand why this isn't considered one of their top three albums.  It has a sort of metal/punk (more metal if you ask me) blend that just sounds great.  Dianno sounds tougher than dickinson and harris has more bass solos than in any of their future albums.  PHANTOM OF THE OPERA IS THE BEST IRON MAIDEN SONG...PERIOD. TRANSILVANIA IS THEIR BEST INSTRUMENTAL SONG AS WELL.  Charlotte the harlot, a song about a [working girl].  How can this not be Iron Maidens best album?  That being said, i truly believe that new metalheads (or to not hurt anyone, contemporary metalheads) will really like this album over the rest of their stuff (killers and Number of the beast are the only 2 albums that are on equal footing).

B000BFH2S2|3.0|The Bobby Darin influence on Michael Buble is obvious, though he does not electrify like Darin did.  The DVD is enjoyable, and if you are a fan of Sinatra, Bennett, Connick Jr., you will like Buble. But of course, he pales in comparison to the master - Bobby Darin.  Check out the \\"Mack Is Back\\" DVD to see a truly electrifying concert.
B0000524CY|5.0|I've been watching this since I was 13. What a record a week or 2. I mean I've seen scary movies and some of them get me scared for 12 hours! But this one tops them all. Satan takes control inside a little girls body (I know I know it's called possesed). After you watch this, you better find or watch something non scarcy or you'll go threw the night sh*ting yourself!

B000A6T1JU|4.0|The other reviews cover what the movie is about, so i'll spare that since you probably already know the summary.  You're probably reading this board for the same reason I did:  To find out which version is worth it to buy. <br /> <br />Here's the news: <br /> <br />If you're a hardcore fan of this movie and remember it as a part of your childhood, it's highly unlikely that you'll like the \\"Ultimate Director's Cut\\".  Some scenes from the original movie were chopped up and cut out.  The main thing that seperates this version from the previous dvd release is the inclusion of comic strip scenes.  You'll be watching the movie and all of a sudden the character on screen pauses, turns into a comic drawing, then the camera moves to another section of 'the page' with a letterboxed caption - 'meanwhile'.   <br /> <br />This is where the early fans seem to dislike the dvd because it takes away from the gritty, vintage, feel of the movie.  The beginning of the feature has a comic intro that parallels this story to the Greek tragedy that inspired it.  Aside from this, the comics really don't contribute to the story nor the film.  If segments like the first were intergrated throughout the movie, it would definitely cause larger damage to the continuity that already affects this film with the comic digresssions as they are. <br /> <br />But if you have little to no patience for 70's movies, or kinda remember this movie, but not really, then you might like this dvd version of it.  What helps is that the movie is enhanced from the original, and looks alot cleaner than its earlier counterpart.  The documentaries provide valuable insight as to how this film was made and came together, the origins of the story, and how the actors look now.  Throw in the 5.1 dolby sound, and it makes for a worthwhile dvd.  But there is no substitute for the original.  They could have added the enhanced sound and picture plus documentaries to the film as it were, and it would have been ten times better.<br /> <br /> <br />SPOILERS: <br /> <br />For those who have seen this dvd, here are my own thoughts on the special features; <br /> <br />I don't know if any of you were annoyed at this, but I would have liked to see a \\"play all\\" option on the documentary menu.  It was a little irritating to keep playing each section after every 14 minutes or so.  Sometimes you just want to have it on and do other stuff.  Not a big thing, but it's funny when you think of how the comics disturb the continuity of the film and how even the special features suffer this fate!  I also didn't like the near-mandatory adds that appear in the beginning.  I get the ad for the video game version of this movie, but it provides an unnecessary inconvenience.  Not to be lazy, but losing yourself in a dvd is where we escape the little technicalites of life.  This is why we watch our movies right?  Sorry, i'll move on before this becomes a Seinfeld bit... <br /> <br />David Patrick Kelly is the MAN!!!  It's hilarious because all the other actors look so different (as expected given the age of the film).  If you could look at this movie and picure his character as an older gentleman, he looks exactly as you would picture him!  And he still has that squirmy, creepy voice!  I remember watching the documentary for the first time, uncertain if the entire ensemble would be back, and anxiously awaiting to hear his two cents, and then out of nowhere, you hear him speak.  Priceless.  He does his infamous saying again when he explains how he came up with the taunt - and it was golden! <br /> <br />I liked how all the actors seemed so enthused about this movie.  It may be seen as pathetic, and that's why many actors try to downplay their parts, but i'd rather see them proud and happy about it rather than act like a-holes.  David Harris and Deborah Van Valkenburgh in particular seem very genuine in their recollections. <br /> <br />I've seen how Walter Hill has drawn comparisons to George Lucas for the tendency to screw with his movies, but this guy has literally turned into him!  Draw a comparison picture and you'll see what I mean.  Funny. <br /> <br />Andrew Laszlo reminded me of GOLDMEMBER. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />Most of the people who have reviewed this dvd have very strong feelings against it.  I don't blame them.   This newer version isn't totally without value, but I could have done without it.  If it absolutely HAD to be made, then the least they could have done was keep the original, remaster all it's components, and then add this newer one as a throw-in.  I know some people, especially newer audiences, don't have patience for dated movies, so for that reason only would I suggest that you may have use for this dvd in showing it to them.   <br /> <br />But if you're only going own one version of this movie, try and get the first edition that came out.  It is currently out of print, but I would suggest either going on ebay where you can get a new or used copy for less than it's being sold here, or burn from a rental or friend.  If you like this movie alot, then I would only recommend buying this newer dvd for the extras and higher quality picture.
0385493622|4.0|If you have a strong mathematical background looking for a book about a sketch of the proof of Fermat's Last Theorem, sorry, this is definitely not your book.  But if this is your first book about the history of number theory, or even mathematics in general, welcome, you've made a good choice.  I think the author knows well enough that this book is for the general audience.     The first 100 pages or so of the book mainly walks through the history of number theory till early nineteenth century. If this is not your first book on the topic, there should be nothing new and you may well skim through it without missing a whole lot.  Then it comes the gist of the story.  The author eloquently presents the biography of those mathematicians involved in the quest, and explains every piece of work required for the eventual proof of the theorem in plain English.  In the last 2 chapters we see a vivid portrait of a contemporary mathematician, Andrew Wiles, who was on the verge of a humiliating failure, but eventually wrote his name in the history book by proving the 350-year old conjecture.    It is an enjoyable book.  Having said that, I think the author could have done a better job by (1) makes it more rigid mathematically (for instance, spells out his assumption on Euclidean geometry when he emphasizes the 'universal' validity of Pythagoras' theorem on p.19); (2) curtails the biography/story of mathematicians when things are not related to Fermat's Last Theorem (e.g. a 12-page biography of Sophie Germain from p.97 to p.109 when only a few lines were about her contribution to the Theorem); (3) enriches the appendix with more technical details.    In a nutshell, it is a good book for the general audience but it is not the best one you could possibly imagine.  For those who are hunting for a slightly more technical approach for the proof of the Fermat's Last Theorem, I would recommend Chapter 3 of the book \\"From Here to Infinity\\" by Ian Stewart.
B000002KIE|5.0|Sure The Doors and The Velvet Underground experimented with the revolutionary sound that would soon take the name, \\"punk\\", but the Sex Pistols along with The Clash and Ramones would make it popular and introduce it to a wide audience.  Never had a band made such explicit politcal and social statements.  The Pistols were very bold and not once did they hide it. <br /> <br />This was very only LP thanks in part to poser boy Sid Vicious who replaced Glen Matlock as bassist and couldn't even play the darn instrument.  Somebody told me that drummer Paul Cook played bass for the band instead of Vicious.  Guitarist Steve Jones was very raw and furious in his musical abilities as was Johnny \\"Rotten\\" Lydon's vocals.  The opening marching sound effect and first guitar chords throw you into the political and social turmoil that the band had on their minds when they released this album.  \\"Anarchy In The UK\\", was a punk anthem that rivaled The Clash's, \\"London Calling\\", as the most important stab at England's social and political vaules.  \\"God Save The Queen\\",  is an exact opposite of England's national anthem.  Here it completely condemns the Queen as a figure head and facist ruler, no better then Hitler.  \\"Bodies\\", is one of the most graphic and explict songs about abortion ever written.  With lyrics like, \\"DIE BABY DIE!!!\\", its no wonder this album was initially banned in both the UK and US.  \\"EMI\\", is a direct stab at one of the top record lables at that time and, \\"No Feelings\\", is about violence towards a man's wife. <br /> <br />The Doors and The Velvet Underground were very dark and explicit at their time but it all seems like child's play when compared to the Sex Pistols' debut album.  Not a record for a strong supporter of the British government but if you like to walk on the wild side this album is for you!
B000BUYP4Q|3.0|As with most recent comic adaptations, some scenes are unecessary, painfully slow, and devoid of any kind of logic. <br /> <br />The companies seem to think of them as 'Epics' in the Spartacus vein, which means they take themselves way to seriously to be enjoyed on a comic level. 2hrs 15mins is just TOO long! <br /> <br />The characters played by liam, Michael, and Morgan are yawningly predicatble stock roles that any of them can do with their eyes closed. Scarecrow/Crane is played out with some looney tension to his due, and Bale is humane enough to pass it off.  <br /> <br />The most exciting bit was the Batmobile 'Tumbler' sequence. The action is turned up 30 notches in realistic 'French Conncetion' style ode, and really delivers a roar. <br /> <br />I'm all for these movies in a disposable, popcorn way. But like I mentioned, they're too cliched and drawn out, and too serious!
B000002I25|5.0|The Doors' self titled debut is still to this day a milestone in rock and psychedelic music.  They rocked harder than most of their peers and explored lyrical territory no one else dared go near.  Jim Morrison's vocals are very sexy an seductive and Ray Mazarek's organ and keyboard work set the standard for other keyboard wizards like Keith Emerson and Tony Banks in the future. <br />Robby Kreiger on guitar and John Densmore on drums make up one of the more interesting rhythm sections of the 60's.  Whoever played bass was very talented as well. <br /> <br />The lyrical content is much more darker and taboo than on most records made up to that time.  \\"Break On Through (To The Other Side)\\", is still a major and popular proto-punk anthem and, \\"Soul Kitchen\\", is a yearning marching hard rock number.  \\"Crystal Ship\\", is beautiful and seductive and, \\"Alabama Song\\" is an almost comical approach on a southern hillbilly song.  \\"Light My Fire\\", is an incredible piece of psychedelic work with an unforgettable organ solo by Mazarek.  At seven mintues long it created the genre know as \\"epic\\" amongst song writing. <br /> <br />Side two is a well sorted collection of fun pop like tunes mixed with some blues and dark psychedelic material.  Its capped off with the epic number, \\"The End\\".  Having a very avant-garde feel to it, that song was the first time anything so graphic, violent and sexually explicit was allowed on a record.  The original vinyl copy was censored but the CD bares all. <br /> <br />Sample lyrics: <br />Father. Yes Son. I Want To Kill You <br />Mother. I Want To (explicit) YOU!!! <br /> <br />This followed by the lyrics: \\"Hey baby lets do it in the back of the bus\\", which is then followed by Morrison shouting out the F word a hundred times.  An interesting but great cap to such a revolutionary album. <br /> <br />As I said before this was the first time an album was so explicit and daring in its musical and lyrical approach.  To see a darker side of the 60's psychedelic era give this album a full listen.
B000B8QEYC|4.0|I love Enya and all her past efforts so this is like yet another breath of fresh air for me. However, I do see other people's point that this is very much like every other past Enya release. It is, in fact, extremely reminiscent of \\"A Day Without Rain.\\" The title track is like a part 2 of \\"Only Time.\\"  <br /> <br />There really is not that much else to say. If you like Enya and have enjoyed her past works, this is highly recommended. If you have not cared for Enya in the past, do not expect thi sto change your mind. Album highlight: \\"Amid the Fallen Snow.\\" This is my favorite Enya song to date second only to \\"Orinnoco Flow.\\" <br /> <br />For those interested, here are Enya's US album sales to date: <br /> <br />The Celts (1987) Platinum (1 million) <br />Watermark (1988) 4x platinum <br />Shepherd Moons (1991) 5x platinum <br />The Memory of Trees (1995) 3x platinum <br />Paint the Sky With Stars (1997) 4x platinum <br />A Day Without Rain (2000) 7x platinum
B000003TA4|5.0|Nothing could have prepared the world for this incredible release.  Grunge is an amazing fusion of metal, punk and rock alternative that only Nirvana and Pearl Jam were ever able to really master.  Not since The Doors released their groundbreaking debut 25 years earlier had rock music taken such a dark step forward and broken so much new ground.  Metallica's, \\"Kill'em All\\", may have rewrote the rules for hard rock but Nirvana published those rule and displayed them to the public. <br /> <br />Opening up with the unforgettable grunge anthem, \\"Smells Like Teen Spirit\\", the album is a driving locomotive of hard rock and post-punk.  The video to that song was revolutionary and many like Good Charlotte and Simple Plan have tried to mimic it but failed completely.  Tracks like, \\"In Bloom\\", \\"Come As You Are\\", and \\"Lithium\\", have become post-punk standards but lesser tracks like the driving force, \\"Breed\\", and the absurd noise maker, \\"Territorial Pissings\\" are no less impressive.  \\"Polly\\", and, \\"Something In The Way\\" mark the quiet and mellow moments of the album, the latter being one of Kurt Cobain's most personal songs.  Sadly this is one of Cobain's only major statements as he only released a few more albums up untill his death in the mid 90's. <br /> <br />The Doors and The Velvet Underground may have given birth to punk and hard rock, and The Clash and Sex Pistols may have made it popular but Nirvana revived it and gave it new life before others like Good Charlotte and Simple Plan made it suffer a second death. This along with Pearl Jam's, \\"Ten\\", and Green Day's, \\"Dookie\\", marked the pinnacle of 90's hard rock.  A must have for anybody interested in post-80's rock & roll.
B000AP04EW|1.0|I knew this movie would be cutesy, but I didn't it expect it to completely insult the viewers' intelligence. Bad story, bad script and bad acting. Even Vince Vaughn, the very best part of this film, can't save this mess. <br /> <br />Want to see a truly funny and clever dysfunctional marriage film? Watch \\"The War of the Roses\\". WAAAAY smarter with much better acting. <br /> <br />Really, I'm surprised the critics didn't totally trash this one. It's really, REALLY bad.
B000006NPY|5.0|Whenever I hear those screaming guitars about halfway into \\"For Martha\\", I think about when I was little and how my dad would turn up the volume at that part. Of course I appreciate it 10 times more now that I'm older and my taste in music has flourished, but I'll always remember listening to the Pumpkins when I was younger. When I rediscovered the Pumpkins a few years ago, this was randomly the first album I listened to. I was completely blown away and the SP became one of my favorite bands just through that first listen. Maybe it was better that I listened to it first, because then I didn't compare it to their previous works. If I can't sleep at night, I always put on this album.. not that it bores me but most of the songs are like lullabies and put me to sleep! Stand-out tracks include For Martha, Shame, Ava Adore, Tear, and Pug. As you've heard a million times, this album is less hard rock/grunge (even though I don't really consider the early SP grunge...) and more gothic, techno and overall just more emotional, as he writes about his mother. Some songs even give you a synthpop Depeche Mode feel (another band I highly recommend!) <br /> <br />I don't know what else to say about this album.. but I recommend it to any Pumpkins fan.. just give it a chance.. I'm not guarenteeing that you'll like it because it's pretty different from their other stuff.. but you should give it a listen and decide for yourself.. don't be influenced by the bad reviews written by those simply afraid of change!
B000B8QEZG|3.0|I am a huge fan of Madonna since the 80's and own all of her last 5 albums. I just bought the very latest album, \\"Confessions on a Dance Floor\\" last week and was not very impressed with the over all album. There are a few songs that i thought were good but besides that i did not care much for it. <br /> <br />The last few albums of Madonna have a dance feel to it, starting with Ray of Light which i really liked. I think the problem here is that she is doing the same type of stuff over and over again. Its all sounds very similar. All the people i know who love this album are on average people who \\"only\\" listen to dance,techno & rave type of music. <br /> <br />People with a diverse taste in music like my self will soon get tired of this trend. Madonna has an amazing talent and shows no signs of aging. I hope her next album will be much different from recent 3 or else she might lose her larger audience to a smaller one that \\"only\\" listens to Dance/Techno and Rave type of music. <br /> <br />I give this current album a C+ <br /> <br /> <br />
B000000WJZ|5.0|Everything wonderful I could say about this album has already been said repeatedly.. but the Smashing Pumpkins are my FAVORITE band and this is probably their best album, although Gish, Mellon Collie and Adore tie a close second. Every track is incredible.. Silverf*ck is the only one I never got that into and I'm not sure why.. but all the songs flow together seamlessly, which is unusual due to the fact that the album alternates between soft lullabies and pretty hard rock. It's hard to choose favorites but some \\"stand-out\\" tracks are Mayonaise, Spaceboy, Quiet, Geek U.S.A, Disarm, Today... see I'm just naming them all.. but that's a good sign! I get goosebumps every time I listen to Quiet and Geek U.S.A! And this album is truly special.. I can only allow myself to listen to it under special circumstances. Of course, I need a full hour of time so I can listen to it in its entirety. Secondly, it needs to be when I'm laying in my bed in the dark or in the car. This album doesn't reach its full potential until you listen to it in the dark; your other senses (eyes and such) aren't distracted, and you can fully concentrate on the music! I cannot tolerate interruptions during my listening of it, especially during a breathtaking guitar solo. I may sound crazy.. but I really believe it is just THAT good! Siamese Dream happened to be the 4th Smashing Pumpkins album I've become acquainted with. If you're new to SP, I want to say buy this album first, simply because I believe it's their best.. but then you may fall into the same position others have.. you will inevitably compare this album to their others and some are very different, so that can't be done! I feel you wouldn't fully appreciate the other Pumpkins' albums for all that they're worth.. so it's a tough call. But disregarding order of introduction, you definately need this album if you are a fan of rock.. no matter what particular subgenre you favor because SP incorporate numerous styles. Although many compare them togrunge bands of the 90's, such as Pearl Jam and Nirvana, their sound is pretty different. However, one thing I must recommend, is don't stop listening to it if you're turned off by the first listen. I was totally unimpressed upon my first listen but it grew on me, and eventually became my all-time favorite album! So don't give up! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
B0000AUHOH|4.0|People love beating William Shatner up for this movie... but really, it wasn't all his fault.  Stupid budget constraints, the absence of ILM effects, and a failed \\"Rock Man\\" suit all worked against poor Shatner!!<br /><br />Unlike \\"The Voyage Home,\\" this film is true \\"Trek.\\"  It has mystery, exploration, spirituality and psychological themes. It may be unpolished, but it WON'T make you yawn.<br /><br />I REALLY LIKE the \\"religious cult leader\\" theme of \\"Sybock.\\"  I enjoyed the fact that he was Spock's brother, and was a \\"passionate Vulcan.\\" The theme of \\"seeking God but finding a devil- like Alien\\" was rich in irony... and a morality tale for the aggressive Sybock... who ends up atoning for his sin.<br /><br />I also loved the idea that one could \\"control\\" people by easing their psychological \\"pain\\"... using the \\"feelings\\" element of spirituality to manipulate followers.<br /><br />The most profound statement to EVER come out of Kirk is \\"(Pain) is what defines us... it's what makes us who we are. We lose this, we lose ourselves! I don't want you to take away my pain... I NEED my pain!\\"<br /><br />Then come the obvious weaknesses.<br /><br />Some of the humor is great... other moments are just silly (Like \\"row, row, row your boat\\" and Scotty knocking himself out.)<br /><br />The effects are very substandard, although the \\"Great Barrier\\" is nice.<br /><br />(Spoiler alert) The conclusion is HORRIBLE! The \\"God Alien\\" becomes some misty form shooting lightning bolts, moaning \\"Yooouuuuu!!!!!\\" It's almost laughably funny. Too bad Shatner's original vision of winged, demonic looking creatures or even a troop of fire breathing \\"rock men\\" wasn't actualized.<br /><br />Having a Klingon Bird of Prey rescue Kirk is a good twist, but it doesn't seem to fit well.<br /><br />And another horrible cliche' comes up in this film... the concept that God resides \\"in the human heart.\\"<br /><br />It's true Star Trek, and it's entertaining. Too bad it's flaws held this film back!!<br /><br />Jeff Messenger, the author of the novel \\"the Shroud of Torrington.\\"is film back!! <br /> <br />Jeff Messenger, the author of the novel \\"the Shroud of Torrington.\\" <br /> <br />
B000001E18|5.0|This is an inspiring and impressive album.  One of the most creative albums the band has produced - well balanced and composed, mature, but still playful and ornate.  The songs leave lots of room for the listener which is not so much the case with their latest stuff.  It's truly daring in terms of the sonic palette they've used, so it's no wonder that some of the songs are seemingly jarring or unexpected on a first listen. <br /> <br />I would write something about how I don't think their new stuff is as good, but then I'd just be like every other U2 fan in the world.  It's going to happen with bands that aren't content to stay in one place.  Sometimes when I see Bono being a bit of a tit (a lovable tit) I get a bit embarrassed that U2 are one of my favourite bands.  But then listening to an album like Zooropa reminds me why.  So that's why I like it.
B0007Y08PQ|4.0|This is a solid Star Trek movie, but slightly more disappointing than Generations or First Contact.<br /><br />\\"Lost Horizon\\" is plagerized, but that's okay... it's a wonderful theme.<br /><br /> The \\"Ba'ku' are very dull, however. They putz about, growing crops, making quilts, baking and playing with the children... but they don't seem to have any purpose! They ENJOY life, but is \\"enjoyment\\" all that life is about?<br /><br />As contrasted with the Amish, at least the Amish have a defined spirituality and an expectancy of Heaven. Right or wrong, they have a future purpose. To the Ba'ku, their current life IS HEAVEN... and they are seemingly immortal. I wouldn't want to live forever, if all life entailed was farming, quilting or picking flowers.<br /><br />The Ba'ku homeworld is a \\"beautiful place to visit, but I wouldn't want to live there.\\"<br /><br />The Son'a... the villians, are a good concept. An aging group who desire immortality. Their vanity isn't their ultimate goal... it's their satirical obsession as they stretch their skin to unrecognizable lengths.  Michael Jackson and Mary Tyler Moore should see this film.<br /><br />F. Murray Abraham is a brilliant actor, even in ludicrous make- up.<br /><br />The effects are good... especially the depiction of the \\"Briar Patch.\\" Alas, ILM seems to have a better touch with the starship effects.<br /><br />the \\"Shuttle chase\\" is a great sequence... which made me expect more excitement... that unfortunately didn't come.<br /><br />The humor is great... albeit, overdone at times. Worf's pimple still makes me crack up.<br /><br />The scenery is exceptional... great location shooting! Star Trek finally escapes the desert!<br /><br />Complaints would be that the battles are fleeting and unfulfilling.<br /><br />The starship battles leave you \\"wanting more.\\"<br /><br /> Crew members firing at dart shooting drones flying through the air has all the drama of shooting cardboard ducks at a carnival.<br /><br />And most definately... TOO MUCH TECHNO- BABBLE!! This film has the most techno gibberish than any other Trek film.<br /><br />Despite these flaws, this is a worthwhile film with more intelligence and humor than most.<br /><br />[...]ese flaws, this is a worthwhile film with more intelligence and humor than most.

B000B8QEZG|4.0|The world needs some joy - welcome back Madonna.  <br /> <br />There's a lot of Madonna/Mariah talk here and on the net at the moment (I love them both), but according to Universal(Mariah's Label)and other sources, Nana Mouskouri(Greece) is the biggest selling female artist in the world. She speaks 15 languages and has recorded in many, so that may help. In the U.S. I believe Barbra Streisand is top.  <br /> <br />Just because an artist has sold more records than another though, doesn't mean they are better or more revolutionary - just ask Billie Holiday if you're ever in Heaven. <br /> <br />Madonna no doubt draws on Carole King(remember her - billboard named her the 3rd most successful songwriter in US history) and Olivia Newton-John's 80's stuff (Madonna says she loves Olivia)amongst others for this fine release. Give the samples a listen and judge for yourself - I hear the angles calling. <br /> <br />Did you know that Bing Crosby has had 41 #1 hits in the US and 383 top 40 singles. He also has 5 academy awards with world wide sales of 900+ million. <br />
B00006G8HX|5.0|This movie, bashed and considered an \\"odd numbered failure\\" in the franchise, is actually better made than \\"The Wrath of Kahn.\\"<br /><br />While the movie does waste time in \\"Spacedock,\\"  it makes up for the sluggish plot with fine moments of humor. McCoy adopting Spock's personality traits was brilliant. Sulu overcoming the cadet who called him \\"Tiny\\" is a fan favorite. The Christopher Lloyd Klingon Captain is hilariously brutal.. it's especially clever to have him execute an officer on his bridge, and then have him call the dead crew member \\"animal!\\"<br /><br />The conclusion could had been better... more fighting, and less standing around a Vulcan ritual... but all and all, this is a great Trek film!<br /><br />Jeff Messenger, author of the novel \\"the Shroud of Torrington.\\"
B000088E6D|5.0|Thanks going out to Michael Buble' for bringing this music back and adding a fresh new twist to it......he's adorable, has awesome stage presence, and to me sounds better than Harry Connick, Jr. & Frank Sinatra.....I an soooooo tired of the songs that are on the radio now, the same 'ol same 'ol, and like him, my Dad & Granddaddy introduced this music to me as a kid.....I listen to him every day, he's definitely got a fan in me!!!!  Way to go and keep it up!!!
B0000UJL96|5.0|Ah, welcome back, Star Trek.<br /><br />Finally, the series restores what was missing with Trek 4 and 5. This film has mystery, humor, good effects, intrigue and action.<br /><br />The Characters are once again \\"fleshed out\\" very well, especially Kirk and McCoy. Christopher Plummer's character is shrewd and cunning, a \\"Kahn\\" in Klingon garb.<br /><br />The cinematography and backdrops are beautiful, complete with a glacier landscape and a high Klingon court room.<br /><br />The battle scenes are well done, and tense! The only complaint here would be the ILM effects... they decided to abandon the old Enterprise model that had a massive amount of interior lighting (called \\"running lights\\"), and instead illuminated the new model with a strong exterior source (like the sun). Unfortunately, the exterior lighting DOES make the ship look like a plastic model!<br /><br />Other than that, the effects are excellent. The soundtrack is dramatic, and the film never gets dull.<br /><br />This movie was a good send off to the original crew.<br /><br />Jeff Messenger, author of the novel \\"The Shroud of Torrington.\\"
B00005LOUP|5.0|This movie is an instant classic and together with \\"Scrooged\\" with Bill Marrey two of the best Christmass movies out there. <br /> <br /> Who can doubt Jim Carrey's talent? He is fantastic! <br /> <br /> For me the term classic is that when the movie plays on tv you cant take your eyes of it no matter how many times you have seen it. I might have seen Grinch today for the third time only but it was a great enjoyment (nothing compared to Scrooged with Bill which I have seen for 20 times or more and I will definetly seen it again this Christmass-he is fantastic also!!!). <br /> <br /> In the end there are some christmass movies which make you feel better and makes you wanna be a better person. Grinch no matter how simple and childish might seem it manages to touch me and it will be a certain movie I will let my children (to come!!) in the near future!!! <br /> <br /> Jim Carrey is one of the best comedians out there today and no matter how repettitive he can become sometimes he is genuine and a great actor...give me one mediocre movie he made...one...
B000083C49|4.0|\\"Considered the best of the Trek series?\\"<br /><br />That would be the assessment of those who don't enjoy Star Trek to begin with.  Having these characters out of the future and present in America, 1980s...  this makes it more \\"assessible\\" to those who never watched the series or other movies.<br /><br />Add to the mix some politically correct environmentalism and activism... \\"Save the whales!\\" (A cause I happen to support). Liberals world wide were having a religious experience.<br /><br />The crew bantar and bounce off of each other perfectly. Very clever humor is infused throughout!  They are really out of their element, as they wander around 1986 San Francisco.<br /><br />Kirk: \\"Well... double 'dumb a$$' on you!!\\"<br /><br />Scotty: \\"Computer? Hellooo computer!\\" .... Speaking into a mouse.<br /><br />Checkov: \\"We're looking for Nuclear VESSELS...\\" to a street cop.<br /><br />\\"Minor\\" crew members also have significant roles and lines, such as Scotty, Checkov and Sulu. This is rare for them. Poor Uhuru is still ignored, for the most part.<br /><br />Other lines are dopey...<br /><br />Spock: \\"Then I'll be sure to make the best guess I can... \\"<br /><br />McCoy: \\"Well, nobody's perfect.\\"<br /><br />Horribly missing from this film is action or urgency. When they release the whales at the end, and the whales \\"communicate\\" with the probe... one can't help but yawn through the whole sequence.<br /><br />This film is a great comedy, but not fully Star Trek in nature.<br /><br />Jeff Messenger, author of the novel \\"The Shroud of Torrington.\\"
B0007OASII|5.0|sound better!!  <br /> <br /> However, its not right to rate it less comparing it to their previous albums. The first time I listened to it, it sounded a little \\"difficult\\" and it took me a while to understand it.  <br /> <br /> Moreover, I believe that the songs get stronger and better from the 6th one and up until the end!!! Imagine my surpise.... <br /> <br /> Trying to figure out why I like the previous albums better I reached to the conclusion simply that they might be 99% perfect but this 1% missing is the thing that makes it better in the previous albums... <br />  <br /> For example, when I listen to \\"Lost and Damned\\", \\"Wander\\", or \\"14 ways to Epica\\" I get excited and my hair rises on my skin!! I just don't get this feeling with the songs in this album. And again I say that the album is very good worth no less than 5 stars and with no filling songs either. <br /> <br /> The band has evolved and manages to create a whole album with no mediocre songs. Khan is one of the best original singers that exist today and his crystal clear voice can be recognized in a second! <br /> <br />So if you rate this album compared to other heavy albums out there its top. If you compare it with previous ones of the same band it lacks just a bit of \\"inspiration and feeling\\" -just a bit though. <br /> <br />
B00005JKHP|5.0|This film has been bashed up and down. Is it a \\"weak story\\" dependent on \\"special effects?\\"<br /><br />Not to me. The film has an awesome villian (and unlike most people, I use the word \\"awesome\\" sparingly), a huge and mysterious craft enveloped by a cloud. It's ominous mystery and deadly power could destroy the Earth itself.<br /><br />(SPOILER ALERT) As the craft is investigated, it's discovered to be an earth probe evolved and seeking it's creator. It needs to have meaning and purpose, much as the dispassionate and logical character of Spock needs.  It needs spirituality, hope and faith!<br /><br />Unlike what most reviewers claim, this movie does do justice to the Star Trek characters.<br /><br />Kirk is dissatisfied with being a desk jockey admiral, and wants to captain a starship once again.  His ego compels him to \\"compete\\" with the current captain of the Enterprise, a young \\"William Decker.\\"<br /><br />Spock has been trained to erase most of his emotions, but finds this path of pure logic unfulfilling.<br /><br />McCoy is as tempermental and sarcastic as ever.<br /><br />This is a unique and imaginative movie, don't be fooled by the negative press.<br /><br />Jeff Messenger, author of the novel \\"The Shroud of Torrington.\\"
B000002U9Y|5.0|This album is the first of the classic Floyd lineup featuring David Gimour.  Yes it is a little rusty around some of the edges but this album is still damn good.  The creativity and all around psychadelic awe that early floyd encompased is clearly here. Yes it's true that the transition from Barret's happy \\"Beach Boys\\" style of psychadelia to Gilmour's darker more rythymic psychadelia was something that the band would take a few albums to master, but this album still has some of the band's best work and should not be dismissed as the weird album they did before \\"Dark Side.\\"  Highlights on this album include, \\"Let there be more light,\\" \\"Set the Controls for the Heart of the Sun\\" and the album closer \\"Jugband Blues\\" which is an eerie tune about Barret's own demise from the band spoken from Barret's mouth.  I know this album isn't as good as Animals or Meddle or Dark Side but I still cherish it with all the classic Floyd releases.
0790742780|4.0|Yeah, yeah... I know, the film is loaded with stereotypes and hokey moments. Especially that scene where Duval sings to his nutty wife over the phone... Ick.<br /><br />Yet, lets get beyond that stuff. Is this film all superficial? No substance? HARDLY!!<br /><br />Number one... it is \\"unique.\\" Oh sure, the retiring cop afraid of being killed on his last day is cliche, but it's not the main thrust of the movie.<br /><br />Number two... stereotypes DO have a basis in reality. It isn't over reaching to imagine the gang members, the convinience store owner unwilling to break a dollar, the fast food joint insisting on \\"lunch menu\\" only one minute after the change over, the neo Nazi militant, the snobbish country club coots, etc, etc.<br /><br />Number three... Douglas has flipped his wig. He's really not responsible for his actions, as he does everything most of us have secretly fantasized about. It's not really a \\"celebration\\" of violence, but it seems absurdly FUNNY as he acts out his retributions. He is obsessed with his ex-wife and daughter... he can't accept their loss. His mind is falling down...<br /><br />Number four... The main thrust of the movie is a societal commentary. Everyone is after the \\"crazy man\\" with a white shirt and gym bag... but when put in perspective, the wandering psycho isn't as \\"sick\\" as what is ACCEPTED in modern day LA.

B000BO0LKY|4.0|Finally, Mariah is back, now this album is more like it,  I don't know where she's been for the last few years, but this is the Mariah I've been waiting for, uh I hope Whitney listens to this album maybe she can find her way back as well.  I'll admit I was hesitant about this album even after Shake it off came out, a song I loved, but everyone kept saying how great this album was, and so I listend to a friends copy and was elated that the whole album was strong.  This is a huge comeback album and I for one am jazzed that she found her way back, she is a singular talent and it's great to see her hit her stride, but I have to ask, uh honey what is with your rack....
B0006GAO5Y|5.0|What a film! What's not to like?<br /><br />Rocky Balboa, a \\"nobody\\" who works for a Loan Shark, but doesn't have the heart to \\"break bones\\" like he's told to.<br /><br />A lonely, sad man approaching his 30s, Rocky feels his life is slipping away. Given the opportunity of a lifetime, he finds dignity through giving it his best effort and \\"going the distance.\\" He is victorious, even through losing.<br /><br />The object of his affection, Adrianne, is a beautiful woman taught to feel bad about herself. She also overcomes the oppression she has felt.<br /><br />Pauli is a semi-villian, but he's ultimately someone to pity.<br /><br />Packed with memorable characters and an INCREDIBLE soundtrack, Rocky is a timeless and inspiring epic!<br /><br />Jeff Messenger, the author of \\"the Shroud of Torrington.\\"
B00009V8Z9|4.0|This c.d. really is infectous.  There is something about Gavin DeGraws voice and his lyrics that really gets you into the song.  He sings the hell out his music and I love that.  Chariot and I Don't Wanna Be, are the standouts on this c.d. but all of the selection is strong.  I saw him perform I Don't Wanna Be, last night on some awards show and he tore it up, the guy has total confidence and real stage presence, he must be great live, but until then I'll just enjoy listening to this top notch c.d.  I highly recommend it.
B0000683DH|5.0|I love the colorful, navel \\"look\\" this film introduced, as opposed  to the \\"sterile\\" long john uniforms of the original film. This Enterprise is a battleship, and it's crew are prepared by combat scenarios.<br /><br />The characters are fleshed out beautifully, as they banter with each other. They hold both deep affection and annoyance with each other... much like a real family.<br /><br />The humor is good... especially the moments were Kirk in his mid life crisis is forced to wear bifocals!<br /><br />The battles are thrilling, and Kahn is an over-the-top madman with operatic themes. His quoting from \\"Moby Dick\\" was brilliant.<br /><br />A few inconsistencies and weaknesses do occur. Kirk's eulogy claimed that Spock \\"gave his life\\" to \\"protect\\" the genesis planet. No, he didn't... he gave his life to save the Enterprise... the planet wasn't formed until after the ship escaped Kahn's explosion and Spock was near death.<br /><br />What a cliche', having McCoy state \\"... he's really not dead... as long as we remember him.\\" Even Hallmark would be embarrassed by this sentiment.<br /><br />Despite some cliches, this film is well made and thoroughly entertaining.<br /><br />Jeff Messenger, author of the novel \\"The Shroud of Torrington.\\"
0393327655|3.0|The concepts were believable in this book , which , by the way, was not written to appeal to a predefined audience.  It is an overview of how all religions have their quirks and how people can rationalize whatever they have faith in-with or without substantiation or proof of their belief.  <br /> <br />A  history of the major religions in the world are given throughout the book, including atheists \\"beliefs\\".    <br /> <br />I found the book extremely well researched...one look at the bibliography and notes, and you will see a third of the book is reference to his sources.  That is commendable and appreciated. Still, I think way too much material was crammed into this one book. Harris should have generalized a bit more and saved the extensive research for future books.
B000BW7QWW|5.0|I really expected this to be one of the big film hits of the year. It was critically acclaimed at its release but failed to generate the box office that I anticipated.  Part of it, I'm sure, was the marketing campaign by the studio. However, upon reflection, I've come to realize that it is hard to boil this down to a simple concept that you can push.  It's a little too complicated for that.  I hope that, like the series, it will be discovered by many more on DVD.  If not, perhaps it will be picked up by someone like the Sci-Fi Channel.  It would make a great companion piece to Battlestar Galactica. There are many  more stories to be told in this universe.                         <br /> <br />By the way, looking at the deleted scenes and the outtakes, there is great extended edition of this film contained within.  I would like some of these scenes reinserted into the film.  This one is something special.
B000BVD460|2.0|First off, if you want Eminem's greatest hits, just buy The Slim Shady LP and the Marshall Mathers LP (and download \\"lose yourself\\").  Overall, this is a very poor assortment of Eminem material.  The tracklisting seems like it was assembled by one of Eminem's 14 year-old female fans from the UK, not Eminem himself.  With the exception of \\"The Way I am\\", \\"Guilty Conscience\\", \\"My name is\\" and \\"Stan\\", there's not really anything on here that is stand-out eminem material.  But the mediocre \\"hits\\" are a breath of fresh air compared to the new bile he's spewing from his ruptured lyrical gut.  The new tracks on this CD range from nauseating to projectile vomit-inducing; \\"fack\\" being the most puke-manifesting of the bunch.  \\"Fack\\" is easily Eminem's worst song, and possibly the worst song ever released by a major recording hip-hop artist.  And contrary to what some people have been saying, it's not so bad it's good, it's just bad.  And it's not just bad for Eminem, it's bad for anybody; well-respected MC or otherwise.  This is the kind of song you found out your little brother recorded with his friends in his bedroom and not only do you make fun of him for it at the time, but you still make jokes about it 25 years later when you see him at Thanksgiving and Christmas.   If it seems like I'm being harsh it's only because past albums have indicated to me the immense amount of talent this man possesses and for him to release such inarguably poor music is simply not acceptable.  J-kwon can do it, lil Zane can do it, Juelz Santana has my blessing, but not Eminem (Jay-z and Nas are also forbidden).  Simply put, the new tracks are awful (barely worth a DSL download let alone an actual purchasing of the album) and virtually none of the Greatest Hits are great.  Although I hate to see Eminem go it certainly seems like it's what should happen, seeing as how it is painfully obvious that he is no longer a caged demon on stage screamin' like rage against the machine, nor is he any longera brainiac with a cranium packed full of more uranium than a maniac Saudi Arabian.
B000BMSTMS|5.0|Why is it that everyone who hates KoRn feels the need to buy their cd just so they can remind themselfs how much they hate KoRn. I can almost guarantee that half the people who gave them a bad review hardly listened to the cd. To be honest, i do agree that some of the songs on it are a big piece of Cr*p, like the song \\"for no one\\". This has to be one of KoRn's worst albums as a nu metal band, but its their best hard rock effort, and as everone said, nu metal is dead(granted people who gave 1 star are probably black metal heads and to be honest, there is no point in screaming or dark tones to make fans feel like they are dark). Id rather buy this cd rather than any awful metal cd. use your own discression on this cd and remeber the fact that most cd's have only 10-11 songs, so even if three songs are bad, they still but out a good album( and by the way, this cd sounds nothing like untouchables, because i hated untouchables and this one rocked. Also the limited edition of this CD has some of the best KoRn songs to date. I suggest this cd, but if you expect some random screaming throught the whole cd, buy another cd so you can spare people your annoying rants about how much you hate KoRn, even though you liked them on life is peachy, THE CD IS TEN YEARS OLD!!!!! IF THEY PUT OUT THE SAME STUFF OVER AND OVER AGAIN, IT WOULD MAKE THEM THE WORST BAND ON EARTH!!!!!
1878424505|3.0|Some years ago, I read this little book and shared it with a friend out in California, calling it a 'gem' so, when I found it again, it was like coming home to a 'friend' who had been waiting until I needed to be reminded of his soul-searching and (could be) life-changing practical knowledge.  This time around, this is what spoke to me specificially:    #1  Through your word, you express your creative powers.  The word is the most powerful tool you have as a human.  It is the power you have to express and communicate, to think, and tereby to create the events in your life.  The word is so powerful that one word can change a life.  The truth is the most important part of being impeccable with your word.  Only the truth will set us free.  One little piece of misinformation can break down communication between people.  Gossip is poison.  Impeccability of the word can lead to personal freedom.    #2  Your point of view is personal to you.  It is your version of the truth.  You have to trust yourself and choose to believe or not what someone says to you.  When we really see other people as they are without taking it personally, we can never be hurt by what they say or do.  Healing is on the way, and it's just a matter of time before things will be better for you.  You are never responsible for the actions of others; you are only responsible for you.  You can experience inner peace and happiness.    #3  The problem with making assumptions is that you believe they are the truth.   It is always better to ask questions than to make an assumption.  When the truth comes out, we find that it was not what we thought it was at all.  Have the courage to ask qustions.  Perhaps you need to gather more facts about a particular situation.  Real love is accepting other people the way they are without trying to change them.  If you don't understand, ask for an explanation.  Find your voice to ask for what you want.    #4  When you wake up refreshed and energized in the morning, your best will be better than when you are tired at night.  Your best will be different when you are healthy as opposed to sick, or sober as opposed to drunk.  Regardless of the quality, keep doing your best.  If we like what we do, if we always do our best, then we are really enjoying life.  We are having fun; we don't get bored; we don't have frustrations.  Be aware and learn from your mistakes.  Letting go of the past means you can enjoy the dream that is happening right now.  You are a master of speaking your language because you practiced.    You must have a strong will to keep these Four Agreements.  You don't have to be religious or go to church every day.  Live one day at a time, and don't be concerned about the future.  Like the brave butterfly, let your spirits fly high and wide.  These are the teachings of the Toltec knowledge.   In southern Mexico, they were the scientists and artist, men and women of knowledge.  They group together in the ancient city of pyramids outside Mexico City.    Don Miguel Ruiz's mother Sarita was a 'healer,' his grandfather, Leonard Macier, a 'shaman.'  His father, Jose Luis, taught him discipline.  His other books include THE MASTERY OF LOVE, BEYOND FEAR, THE VOICE OF KNOWLEDGE (2004) and his newest, THE SPIRIT RECOVERY.
B000929AJQ|5.0|Trent Reznor did it again.  Read on, this review is very short and very true.  With Teeth is an excellent breakthrough, because he gets in touch with all of his signature styles, but produced it with a more live, instrumental band sound that shows that what he made in the past was not good because of the computers and synthesizers, but because of Trent's compositional and musical talents.  This is definitely something that will create controversy and appreciation from any modern music lover (synth, rock, pop, techno, etc).   <br /> <br />DM
B00005N7Z1|5.0|This is a damn near perfect movie. It has intense fight scenes, wonderful graphics, terrific quotes, and a lot of feeling, danger, evil and determination. Here is how the story goes-There is a new cop on a team in Detroit. His name is Alex J Murphy. Dick Jones, the leader of this cop department, who is actually a bad guy wanting to create cop machines that are really killers. Meanwhile, Anne Lewis and Alex are starting to be friends, when a ruthless and notorious cop killer named Clarence Boddicker is hired by Dick Jones to take Murphy out. With the help of his gang, he succeeds, but Murphy is brought back to life by doctors who make him part man, part machine. He is amazingly strong and almost indestructible, and has all sorts of weapons from guns to hand spikes. He is dubbed Robocop, and in no time proves worthy as he trashes all sorts of criminals, saves all sorts of lives and protects Detroit. However, the memories of Clarence Boddicker and how he took his ordinary life away from him makes Robocop want not only justice for others, but also revenge for himself. He soon finds Clarence after plowing through some of his gang, fights him and arrests him. Clarence gets free, though, and talks to Dick, who he makes a plan with to crush Robocop once and for f**king all. Clarence and his remaining gang attack Robocop and Lewis, who is with him and is the only human he'll listen to, at a large construction site. Soon, most of Clarence's gang is dead, and only he and one more member remain. While Robocop moves in, intent on killing Clarence and ending his menace forever, he is dropped on by a lot of metal bars released by Clarence's last henchman, who gets blown to bits along with the building he's in while he and his boss cheer, by Anne Lewis' rocket launcher, no less. Now, Clarence is on his own, but it seems like that doesn't matter, as he sticks a metal spike into Robocop's chest and injures him badly. However, even if Clarence can fend for himself with weapons, what he did to Robocop is still nothing compared to what Robocop does to him. He extends the spike on his hand I mentioned earlier and to say it nicely Robocop gives Clarence the Hector treatment. After Clarence is destroyed, he takes Anne with him to get medical treatment, and then goes for Dick Jones at the police headquarters. After revealing Dick's betrayal, Robocop can't attack as Dick threatens an old but important bossman with a gun and will kill him unless given an escape helicopter. But the old man and Robocop have the last laugh. Despite his age, the man's in good shape and he breaks Dick's hold and says: \\"You're fired!\\" And so, Dick Jones meets his demise as Robocop fills him full of bullets and he crashes out a window, falling thousands of feet to the rock hard pavement. Robocop tells the others he is Murphy and the movie ends. This is among the best movies I have ever seen. It gets a solid and gold 10 out of 10 and I recommend it to anyone who likes fighting films.
B000B8QEZG|5.0|This album is by far Madonna's best, like a collection of songs meant for dancers and people who like to move, every track has a good beat.  I like how this covers basically all of the popular styles of dance music in the past up to today in a very excellent, concise CD.  This is the kind of CD you listen to everyday and never get tired of.  I very highly recommend this CD.  This is not an album where you listen to two songs and want something else, you really get your money's worth.  I'm actually amazed it wasn't full price.   <br /> <br />DM
0440241588|1.0|Ok...where is it written that, if you have sold millions of books worldwide, you can start writing books that are HORRIBLE and still get wonderful reviews? John Grisham's \\"The Broker\\" is fit for the garbage which is why I am trying to warn any other potential readers from falling for the flashy reviews this novel has gotten(mainstream reviews). Not only does the book make you want to drive your head into the wall (by the 3rd chapter) it will make you slightly dumber- it's a proven fact. I was reading this book on my lunch break and I could feel Grisham's words creeping through my brain, eliminating any intelligent thoughts I had in there, and replacing those thoughts with Grisham's crappy dialogue. I am 200 pages through and, since I NEVER put a book down, I will force myself to finish it. I just want to warn everyone else against this literary catastrophe. Resist the enticing reviews  <br /> <br />\\"Where Grisham Leads, Millions will follow\\" -New York Daily News <br /> <br />\\"Like a meticulous magician debutting a fancy trick,Grisham takes great care in creating his setup\\" -People <br /> <br />I should have known...with these generic, flashy comments, that the book would probably suck but hey, I am a sucker for punishment, what can I say? Do yourself (and your brain cells) a favor and do not purchase this book.  <br /> <br />It just makes me so mad that mainstream authors write CRAP and expect us to read it.

B00003CWPL|5.0|I saw this once in a theater years ago, then many dozens of times since I've watched and re-watched the horrible VHS copy I had, to the point where I have dedicated all Eraserhead dialogue to memory. It is a beautiful and hilarious one-of-a-kind film that stands up to Lynch's best work. (Mulholland Drive, Blue Velvet, Elephant Man). What I never really knew or had a chance to appreciate until the release of this amazing DVD is how gorgeous the cinematography is, incredible lighting, every frame a sumptuous surrealist tableau... and the sound design may be even more amazing. Lynch did an incredible job with this remaster. And the on-screen interview with him is a joy to watch. I could listen to that guy talk for hours and hours... I don't care if he's talking about pie and car transmissions and stuffed animals instead of Eraserhead... just keep talking. Lynch is an Original and Eraserhead is a cinematic Treasure. The naysayers are all babies.
B000002LRX|5.0|The first thing you notice about this album is the startling difference here in Mike Patton's voice from The real Thing. Unless you were familiar at the time with Patton's work with Mr Bungle, there's no way you'd think it was the same Mike Patton. His voice is deeper and matured and sounds like a completely different singer. Like Mr Bungle's debut album, Angel Dust really showcases Patton's truly beautiful voice, range and versatility - it's a marvel to listen to him crooning melodically one minute and then screeching aggressively the next. He surely has one of the most distinct male voices ever, not just in rock - I've always thought he'd make a good opera singer if he wanted to. <br /> <br />Whereas The Real Thing was conceptually singular and monochrome in style and sound, Angel Dust is a lot more colourful and playful, changing direction drastically. Out went the slap bass (except for a few instances)and the raw metal sound and in came Patton's developed vocals, increased production values and more keyboards and synths. The Land of Sunshine is a great opener, with a catchy, bouncy rhythm complimented by some of FNM's last slap bass style. Caffeine is a classic metal track with some of the percussion recalling Zombie Eaters from The Real Thing. Midlife Crisis is a great, rhythmic pop metal piece with great vocals. In fact, every track is a gem. Tracks like Everything's Ruined, Kindergarten, Be Aggressive and Crack Hitler would continue to showcase FNM's superior rhythm section and melodic writing and tracks like Smaller & Smaller, Malpractice and Jizzlobber would add to their collection of great metal tracks. The latter is a wonderfully over-the-top rhythmic piece of aggression about self love with a couple of great metal riffs and ending with an hilarious chuch pipe-organ solo - that was another thing that seperated FNM from other rock acts, they had a sense of humour and were able to portray that in their music. The last couple of tracks are decent covers, oneof the theme from John Barry's Midnight Cowboy and the other The Commodores' Easy but they don't really belong on the album, they are not really consistent with the album's sound and style and I usually skip them. <br /> <br />Sadly, FNM would never again reach the same highs or level of superior writing as they did here and with The Real Thing. Their following albums would still throw up some great material but were never as consistently good as these two, but with these two, FNM ensured they would go down in history as one of the best ever rock acts and their genre melding style and rhythm would influence many others to come.
B0001AVZA8|1.0|As evidence of my recent malaise, I subjected myself last night to watching Something's Gotta Give with Jack Nicholson(who I can rarely stand any more) and Diane Keaton (who I thought I could stand but now realize I can't).<br /><br />Why I sat through the whole stupid thing is beyond me. I had the beginnings of some perfectly good work in the studio. I'd already eaten my popcorn for the day, and I'd spent more than enough time on the couch. But sit through it I did.<br /><br />Are there any words to describe the horror of seeing Jack Nicholson's baggy 60 something ass sticking out of a hospital gown? I know it was meant to be funny, but there are SOME things that are just too gross for humor. And this was one of them.<br /><br />Was it a big fricking deal to see Diane Keaton's middle aged but acceptably perky breasts jiggling around as she tried to cover the rest of her 50+ but fit body in the infamous NUDE scene? No. there was no gratification, humorous or otherwise to seeing it.<br /><br />Should I get all worked up to see dopey Keanu Reeves try to play a handsome young doctor smitten with an *older woman*?--no, because his brain still wasn't there no matter how hard he tried to look *intelligent*.<br /><br />Should I toss whatever cookies might still remain in my stomach at the sight of a blubbery Jack Nicholson, all smarmy eyed to the max, getting all misty over Diane Keaton?? Christ almighty!<br /><br />And worst of all-- do I HAVE to hear a good five minutes of Diane Keaton pretending to act like she's crying. Sobbing, wailing, moaning, getting it all OUT---all because she fell in LOVE with that blubbery smarmwhale and then saw him with a little blond chippy in a restaurant?<br /><br />GOD!!!! are there not enough reasons in the world to shoot oneself without the cinema adding to it?<br /><br />Have I said how STUPID, SAPPY, MORONIC and INSIPID this movie was???<br /><br />well there, I just did.
B000AP04FG|3.0|Whether or not you're a fan of Pitt and/or Jolie, this movie is worth renting. The concept of a married couple who know nothing of each other's past nor what each other really does for a living provides great suspense. It turns out that both work as secret agents or even assassins who eventually are assigned to kill each other. The plot gets interesting up to this point but viewers upon watching this will learn why I didn't give this movie a fourth or fifth star. Everything was pretty much good up until the last portion of the movie. That is to say, the script became weak up to that point. Overall, the film still holds your interest and I can't say it isn't worth renting. Just don't expect it to be oscar material.
0743518144|5.0|I found myself in an office depot looking for a better organizational system for my sales leads, all dozen of them, when I found this tape series on a shelf.  After reading the synopsis on the back, I realized that I was in the wrong occupation. As a highly technical person, I was eking out a living in sales. <br /> <br />I oddly enough didn't buy this tape, because I didn't have the money and I got the message so strong on the back cover that I felt any further \\"getting it\\" would be impossible. <br /> <br />I drove home, quit my job and against my wife's wishes I started studying for a technology career.  6 months later I landed a job in the technology field.  Within 3 years I'm now making 2-3 times my old income every month without feeling like I don't belong here. <br /> <br />If you need more encouragement than myself, by all means read the book.
B000000OQY|4.0|This little release pales in comparison to Appetite and the two Use Your Illusion records, but it is still a worthy effort from the Guns.  The first four tracks are acoustic, showing the musical versatility of GNR, but one of them, 'You're Crazy' was already on Appetite as an electric version.  'Patience' was the only single off this disc, and is a fine song.  The other two tracks have controversial lyrics.  'Used to Love Her' deals with women who piss us off, and the thoughts we sometimes get about shutting them up.  'One in a Million' caught the most media backlash, though, with lyrics that put down police, african americans, gays, immigrants, and just about anyone except heroin addicts from LA who write music!  I'm not putting down the song - I'm just making an observation that Axl is nuts! <br /> <br />The other half of the disc is from a previous bootleg live release called \\"Live Like a Suicide\\" with the raw GNR originals, 'Move to the City,' 'Nice Boys,' and 'Reckless Life'.  There's nothing too special here, but I thought the guys did a great cover of the early Aerosmith classic, 'Mama Kin,' mostly because it was much more agressive than the original version. <br /> <br />This is an often underrated GNR album, but I would check out 'Appetite' and 'Use Your Illusions I & II' first.  GNR basically only has 4 studio albums, a 2-disc live set, and a disc of punk covers, so all GNR should be essential to your collection.
B000002UJQ|5.0|Radiohead has outdone themselves this time. If you like music, you will like this CD. I would point out songs that are especially good, but I would just name all the songs on the album. Ok Computer is by far the best Radiohead album by a long shot. Buy this album.
B000BYRCH4|2.0|The cinematic concoction Into the Blue by John Stockwell brings the memories of many B-movies released during the 1970s and 1980s, as it provides a healthy dose of butt shots, sexual innuendos, and violence in its visuals.  Occasionally, it proves to be an efficient blend, as the film presents levels of humor, suspense, and action.  However, the complete product also allows the audience to reminisce about where B-movies emerged.  The film displays large portions of cinematic awkwardness that seems to rest within a partially finished script, one-dimensional characters, and the obvious of exploitation of Jessica Alba's female curves.<br /><br />In the tropical paradise of the Bahamas, Jared (Paul Walker) has found himself a refugee from the monotonous life of holding a stead job and listening to the orders of bosses.  He is an avid reader of history, as it supports his desire to be a treasure hunter.  It is not for the quick riches Jared seek treasures, but for the self-fulfilling purpose to uncover the truth of the lives and the tragic fates of those lost at sea (or at least that is what the film tries to convey.)  At his side, always wearing a bikini, the audience can find Sam (Jessica Alba), as it is treasure enough for Jared and the whole world watching the film, something the director is obviously aware of due to the numerous shots scanning her body.<br /><br />The film opens with a plane crashing into the ocean, which Jared later discovers during a snorkeling trip with his best friend and lawyer Bryce (Scott Caan).  Bryce has come to the Bahamas to have a little well-earned vacation (I wonder if this character has ever worked or gone to law school as he shows tremendously little work ethic) and he has brought an easy girl, Amanda (Ashley Scott).  Together this quartette goes snorkeling while discovering valuable remnants of a shipwreck and the crashed plane full of drugs.  Both discoveries offer opportunity of wealth, but the choices will reveal the true character and the choices will have dire consequences.<br /><br />The idea is honest, however, the story, the characters, and the abusively large amount of underwater shots adds lead to this cinematic experience, as it slowly continues to sink towards the bottom.  The story does not evoke a sense of urgency, or secrecy as the characters party all night long and dive all day (when do they sleep?)  It also makes the discovery on the bottom of the sea feel unimportant.  The cast accentuates the awkwardness by only allowing their presence and actions to emerge on the screen while the emotional expression is that of a rock.  The film has an overwhelmingly large amount of underwater scenes, as most of it works like additional visual fluff.<br /><br />If the viewer is fond of seeing men and women in bathing suits, it is obvious that this is a film for them.  Jessica Alba's sex appeal might also sway a group of audience members to seek out this visual experience.  However, the sexiness cannot save the complete cinematic experience, as Into the Blue presents a truly deficient experience that might induce inappropriate laughter and much eye rolling in-between the bootylicious camera shots.racter and the choices will have dire consequences. <br /> <br />The idea is honest, however, the story, the characters, and the abusively large amount of underwater shots adds lead to this cinematic experience, as it slowly continues to sink towards the bottom.

B000067FP8|5.0|Gremlins 2 should definately be considered a superior sequel. Everything about this movie is top notch and for B-flicks that usually is not the case. Even the critics who despised the first Gremlins gave this movie good reviews. So much creativity was put into this film that it surprises me Spielburg didn't return to the project(Joe Dante did return). Everything from character development, stage settings, the music, and overall story were well thought out and you can tell that the actors enjoyed playing their parts and had a good time on the set. Gremlins 2 by no means takes itself too seriously. The first portion of the movie gives you the impression that it will be rushed though it doesn't end up that way. Four of the characters including Gizmo return from the first Gremlins and the gremlins themselves are designed a bit differently though it is definately for the better. Regarding my comment on the creativity of this movie, you must see it for yourself. This gremlins sequel (superior sequel, mind you) gets the DVD treatment it deserves like Terminator 2 did in terms of bonus features (okay, Terminator 2 had alot more but you get my point). Each feature is worth viewing and there are also some easter eggs a.k.a hidden features. At first I hoped for a Gremlins 3 but I don't see how it would rank up with this one. Even if you happened to not care much for the first Gremlins, you still should give Gremlins 2 a look. I honestly know someone who didn't care too much for Gremlins but told me they really enjoyed the sequel.
B000AMJDHY|5.0|Chicago is an interesting city nowadays. They seem to be training these kids to live and breathe hooks, high pitched vocals, and randomly non-conventional music. Fall Out Boy put out their pop masterpiece with From Under the Cork Tree. The Academy Is... put out a debut that easily equals the pop princesses and princes with double the amount of talent. OK Go took the more rock-pop approach. And now this. Now before you all go and start to say I am not helpful and that i am a poser who has succumbed to pop-punk as my favorite music. Its not true. now please read on <br /> <br />after the intro, the album starts out with a kick. from the first notes i knew i had found a new guilty pleasure. little did i know, that this album never falters. their slightly unnecesarily long, yet occasionally witty, titles are part of the new fad. like most of what Panic does, however, they do it almost better than anyone. the next song has a little bit of a bite to it, but retains the hooks that you will grow to love. Nails for Breakfast, Tacks for Snacks is one of the most synthy of the songs, and is also relatively slow. The following track is my least favorite song on the album, but it certainly has its high points. but these first few songs are simply to get you ready for their style. now for the real good songs <br /> <br />Starting with Time to Dance, the album truly picks up. Time to Dance is an aptly named song with memorable lines (When I say shotgun you say wedding), danceable beats in tune with lyrical hooks, and intelligently designed instrumentation. This is my favorite track on the album. Lying is the Most Fun a Girl Can Have really caught my eye on the cd because it is a wonderful allusion to the movie Closer, which is one of my favorite movies of all time. It starts out tantalizingly low, with the singer having all of the bravado and arrogance of musicians with much more experience that he. Yelling \\"lets get these teen hearts beating faster, faster\\", you believe the yearning to get people dancing. Intermission is a lyricless, electronica-based powerhouse showing off that the techno beats aren't just a whim <br /> <br />But It Better If You Do (a continuation of the line from Closer), is a funny, fast paced song that truly showcases the singer's voice. I Write Sins Not Tragedies is a lyrically out of place, but catchy as hell, track that swoops and swoons like any good pop-punk should. I Constantly Thank God for Esteban is admittedly a low point at this part of the album, but i have a large amount of affection for it. It attempts to soar, but finds itself falling flat <br /> <br />There's a Good Reason These Tables are Numbered, You Just Haven't Though of It Yet is my second favorite track on the album. It draws upon a type of jazz, and a breakup bitterness at a formal event. \\"I'm the new cancer, never lookeded better and you can't stand it, because you say so under your breath. You're reading lips when did he get all confident?\\" the singer spits at his ex, and it is very much believable. Great song. The final song has some noticeable differences. It is just as catchy, just as good, but takes part more in rock-pop than pop-punk. definitely a good sound for them.  <br /> <br />one last note about these guys. they have only been a band for about 6 months or so, and they are all 18 and 19. talent from people so young can either spell early flashes in the pan or musical legends in the making. lets hope for the latter. one way or another, this debut is going to be looked on with much affection from this fan
B000002KNY|5.0|I guess that sounds like a big statement but in my reality it is not too far from the truth. <br />Talking Heads enter the 80's with Fear of Music, arguably the most droll and cliched decade of rock. <br />Although there are plenty of shining lights of the 80's few can stake claim to have recorded an album that defined the era without having a dated sound which ties them to that time. <br />The sequence and flow of an album was never bettered by Talking Heads, and Eno's production while omnipresent is never overbearing. <br />Fear of Music IMHO is the most influential album of the last 25 years. <br />The effects are still manifesting themselves in current bands like Franz Ferdinand and Interpol. <br />Along with Joy Division and Wire, Talking Heads are really the beginning of the intellectualising of post punk, the ramifications which thankfully are still being felt today.
B0009I7O7A|5.0|I have to write a review in response to Raymond Lopez's review of this disc.<br />Ray I would agree with you that Enhanced Stereo is a load of rubbish and that putting out a disc with 16-bit 48hz audio is no different than a CD and a waste of the medium, but my friend this is not just an Enhanced Stereo release.<br />This disc also includes some very cool video footage, but the key elements are the audio.<br />Mr Lopez suggests that there is nothing Enhanced on this DualDisc - but people that is a GOOD THING.<br />Check this - Sony keeps putting out a number of discs with Enhanced Stereo on them.<br />CD = 16-bit 44.1hz audio<br />Enhanced Stereo = 16-bit 48Hz stereo<br />There's hardly any difference there at all - it's a complete sham.<br />Now onto DualDisc titles like Nine Inch Nails' \\"With Teeth\\" and \\"The Downward Spiral\\" or Dire Straits \\"Brothers In Arms.\\" These discs are all released with Advanced Resolution 5.1 surround tracks on them that are stunning. They blow Enhanced Stereo away.<br />Again<br />CD = 16-bit 44.1Hz audio<br />Enhanced Stereo = 16-bit 48Hz stereo<br />John Mayer RFS Dual Disc = Dolby Digital 5.1 multichannel audio.<br />NIN - Downward Spiral DualDisc = 24-bit 48Hz 5.1 multichannel audio<br /><br />Please for anyone else wondering if this disc is worth it - if you have a home theatre system and a DVD-Video player, or better yet have a DVD-Audio or SACD player, then check out some of the DualDisc titles, but look at what's on the disc. Enhanced Stereo is a load of rubbish, Advanced Resolution DVD-Audio (like the kind found on many DualDisc titles) is not rubbish and takes audio appreciation to the next level.<br /><br />EDIT - please note this disc has Dolby Digital 5.1 which can be played through a DVD-Video player. It DOES NOT have advanced resolution DVD-Audio on it. The best quality version of this release is the SACD version.
B00005JO1Y|5.0|Just like Peter Jackson, I have been enthralled with the story of Kong ever since I saw the original replayed one Saturday afternoon when I was probably no more than 10.  Lucky for me the same channel played Mighty Joe Young the very next week and I have been hooked ever since.  I am also one of the proud few who also enjoyed the 1976 Kong re-make with Jeff Bridges.  Sure it was cheesy, but it was Kong and I enjoyed it immensely.  Imagine my surprise when I found that the architect of the incredibly entertaining Lord of the Rings movies was planning on doing his own faithful rendition of Kong.<br /><br />First off, as an avid fan of special effects, I am just about the worst critic when it comes to paying such close attention to how realistic they are or aren't.  I have good and bad to say in regards to this edition of Kong: Overall the effects were stunning...however about the ONLY place where effects looked poor happened during the dinosaur stampede scene.  Absolutely gigantic creatures running towards you through a rather narrow ravine sounds a lot better than it turned out.  Was it a blast to watch anyway?  You bet.  Without a doubt, the Kong/T-Rex fight rivals just about any action scenes in virtually any film ever released.  Not just one, but Kong takes on 3 at the SAME TIME...all while cradling Ann Darrow in one hand.  Talk about an unfair fight.  Watching two of them get caught up in the enormous vines in a canyon wall STILL attempting to capture Ann was just incredible to say the least.  That scene alone ought to earn the movie the Academy Award for special effects.<br /><br />I would have to say that each scene featuring Kong looked authentic in every way.  Props to the folks who are out to give Industrial Light & Magic a run for the money as Hollywoods premiere special effects producers.  Certain portions of the film seemed to last just slightly longer than necessary.  I can't put my finger on exactly why, but even shaving off a couple of seconds would have made a huge difference.  I believe that Peter Jackson was so intent on doing such a good job that he almost lost sight of one of the biggest rules of movie making: leave us wanting MORE.  Don't get me wrong, I really REALLY enjoyed the movie...I would have liked CERTAIN scenes to have been cut by only a few seconds.<br /><br />Jackson brought a wonderful sense of entertainment specifically towards the end of the movie after Kong escapes into New York with Ann and finds his way into Central Park on a frozen pond.  This part of the movie was just spectacular.  Not just for how carefree it was, but how it allowed us to seriously CARE for the giant ape.  Unlike some of the scenes which lasted a bit too long, this one in particular was done virtually to perfection ending just as you begin to warm up to the playful side of Kong.<br /><br />The climatic ending atop the Empire State Building is simply movie-making at its finest.  The stunning visuals of New York caught up in the middle of the Depression were just amazing.  It ALL looked SO REAL.  Once again, kudos to the effects crew for recreating one of the truly bitter-sweet moments of film history, improving in EVERY way upon the original.  You KNOW what awaits Kong as he climbs to the peak of the worlds tallest building, but even as it was happening, I found myself rooting for Kong.  Every time the planes came by I was hoping against hope that he would catch and destroy them all.  Of course the ending came as no surprise, but all the same it did not stop me from hoping and wishing for things to have turned out differently.<br /><br />One tiny observation: am I the only person who noticed the incredible resemblance between Naomi Watts and Nicole Kidman?  There were several scenes that made Naomi look like Kidman's twin.  Oh well, even so, I just thought I'd bring it up.<br /><br />One small note for parents who are planning on bringing young ones: DON'T.  This movie is rated PG-13 for a very GOOD reason.  Not becauseof sexual themes, but because of quite disturbing visuals, namely the gigantic insects.  At the very least, shield them or take them out during this portion if you feel it necessary to bring them along.  It was quite intense, and could foster some disturbing dreams in the nights to come.<br /><br />All in all, Peter Jackson has cemented his place as Spielberg's rightful heir.  It has been a MIGHTY long time that Steven has stayed at the top of Hollywoods mountain of talented directors, and for good reason.  Who else could direct a movie featuring unknown actors with a script written by a 1st grader and earn a Hundred Million? But its time for someone new to take his place and I believe that person IS Peter Jackson.<br /><br />If you are looking for a three-hour getaway from the world, give King Kong a try and be prepared to be totally enthralled for a very long time.  I already want to see it again.on.  Not because of sexual themes, but because of quite disturbing visuals, namely the gigantic insects.

B000067FP7|4.0|Gremlins is quite possibly the most out of touch Christmas movie there is and oh how the critics hated this one! Still, Joe Dante and Steven Spielberg manage to pull off a pretty decent genre even if it is out of season. If you are into pop culture, Gremlins is probably one of the many unique films of the 1980's, especially 1984. To sum up the story, a man gets his 18 year old son a pet from Chinatown known as a Mogwei (spelling?). The pet's name is Gizmo and there are a few rules to consider. The first, don't let it near bright light or sun light which could kill it. The second, don't let it get wet. The third, never feed it after midnight. Sound ridiculous? It is, but the movie is still good none the less. There is campy and somewhat demented humor here and there from the gremlins themselves even though they turn out to be semi-vicious monsters but the movie doesn't fail to entertain those with open minds. Plus, the character development along with the acting is good and you may find yourself wanting to watch Gremlins every couple years or so. Though the movie starts out serious its B-roots tend to show but that doesn't hurt it. The DVD has good features which is an improvement over the original DVD release.
B000286S8S|3.0|This band was so good when they came out, I cant understand what went wrong. I know DLR has an incredible ego and he an ***hole sometimes but jesus, he is the voice of this band. Hagar sucks, he should have never joined. Though some of the reviewers have said the last 3 live songs are on this CD in studio form, Panama is not on this CD in studio form. I think it was a bad idea to put those on here without Roth singing them. Hagar does them no justice. I wish they would bury the hachet with Roth and go out on tour, they would sell out EVERYWHERE. Well I like this CD but it should be more Roth material and less Hagar. oh well what are ya gonna do.
B0002858YS|5.0|I bought the CD after seeing the music videos for \\"Mister Brightside\\", \\"All These Thing's I've Done\\", and \\"Somebody Told Me\\", and I am *so* glad. I've listened to it ten times. The lyrics are really intriguing, and the music is catchy. I absolutely *love* it!!! It's completely worth the multiple exclamation points.  <br /> <br />(Just a side note: some people have mentioned that it's unoriginal. I couldn't DISagree more, but I don't have a very large music collection and don't really know enough about the genre to have a valid opinion.)
B0000YWKHC|5.0|Sensitive, smart, masterfully performed and flawlessly directed. In my opinion, one of the best films of all times. Johansson is sexy and intelligent, however a little snobish and lost. Bill Murray brings great dramedy doing what no other actor could have achieved this perfectly: He is funny without trying to be funny. He is a sad man that has not lost his sense of humor. <br /> <br />In a conventional Hollywod film Charlotte and Bob would have had an affair and blah blah blah, but here the relationship between them is treated very subtly, it evolves in a beautiful and organic way. They like and understand each other, maybe there's even love, but at this moment their lives are so sad, that from within their desperation this brief contact is enough.  <br /> <br />Many will say that the film is highly overrated and it lacks a clear narrative structure, but why do you need that when all the other elements are there; besides that's the whole point: the film IS called LOST in Translation. <br /> <br />Coppolla includes silent, reflective moments, and also ridiculous  over the top misshaps; reminding us how funny and enjoyable life can be; if we let it. (or we could end up in a monotone existence like Bob.) <br /> <br />This is truly a cinematic gem, incredibly relatable, even if you are not a burnt out movie star working in Japan or a young college grad at an emotional crossroad; it is about everything: life, love, isolation, humor, children, fun, drugs, youth, innocence, Sex, marriage. just great!
B00006AFUR|5.0|This is the debut album self titled \\"30 Seconds to Mars\\". When I first came across this CD in the stores I was very timid in purchasing it, in fear of let down. But this CD was very different. This is not your ordinary CD, every track is well recorded and every track is vary good to listen to. I have not had the chance to pick up their new album, but I am sure it will be as good as their first.
B0009MDPYM|1.0|Bland rip off of a great comic book not only puts the worse actor imaginable for the main character but has a script that is almost a crime in itself. The dialog is so bad that it would even make deaf children cry and the special effects are not as good as one might hope. Some of the acting is great and that's a great feat in itself because of how bad the script is. Rachel Weisz, Djimon Hounsou and Tilda Swinton do great work here and for that, people should be grateful for but it's still Keanu's film and he still torpedo it with a lousy performance that is in tune with the lousy script it has.  <br /> <br /> <br />If this is the best they have to offer for the fans of the comic book, then take it back. <br />
B000BW7QWW|5.0|Translating a cult TV show to the big screen is often tricky business. Even with a heavyweight director like Robert Wise \\"Star Trek: The Motion Picture\\" did well at the box office critically the film became the Titanic with its long ponderous shots of V'Ger and the long lingering affectionate gaze at the Enterprise. Few TV properties truly make the jump to the big screen well so I was surprised and elated that \\"Serenity\\" Joss Whedon's (\\"Buffy The Vampire Slayer\\", \\"Angel\\") film extension of his TV show \\"Firefly\\" actually was very good. Fans of the show turned out in droves and critically it was a success but the theater seats were empty for most of its showings. That's too bad because Whedon does a nice job of giving a backstory to nonfans and still manages to capture the flavor of the TV show.<br /><br />Set centuries in the future the transport vessel Serenity commanded by Mal Reynolds (Nathan Fillion who comes the closest to channeling the spirit of Han Solo since Harrison Ford) is smuggling more than contraband-they're carrying a River Tam (Summer Glau) who has been altered by the government to become a brilliant killing machine and they want her back. Her brother Simon (Sean Maher) fakes his way into the facility where she's being kept and rescues her he spirits her off in the Serenity. The Alliance sends a nasty operative (Chiwetel Ejiofor) who will stop at nothing to obtain River including murdering anyone who stands in his way not just because of what she can do but also because of what she knows about illicit experiments the Alliance has been conducting since its formation. Mal bonded with Zoe (Gina Torres), her husband and pilot of the Serenity Walsh (Alan Tudyk), engineer Kaylee (Jewel Straite) and Jayne (Adam Baldwin) during the Brown Coat War for independence (Whedon was inspired to create the backstory for \\"Firefly\\" from the conflict during the Civil War and other incidents in U.S. history) Unfortunately, the pursuit of the Alliance puts the crew of Serenity at odds with River and Simon and they begin to wear out their welcome.<br /><br />Featuring a stellar cast, \\"Serenity\\" is a rarity in that it makes the transition to the big screen effortlessly and Whedon manages to clue in those who didn't follow the series with a breathtaking opening sequence that illustrates things fans were told had occurred during the first season but never saw. I suppose \\"Firefly\\" fans can satisfy themselves with the fact that they got their movie which essentially crams the story arc Whedon had planned for the second season into a two hour feature film. Sadly, the film stiffed at the box office despite a terrific campaign by Universal to attract both the hardcore Brown coat audience (so called because of the colors Mal's troops wore during the Civil War with the Alliance). It's unlikely we'll see another \\"Firefly\\" TV show or movie. Since Whedon wraps things up but also leaves the door open the film manages to work both ways for fans by providing closure to one of the main story points of the first season and opening up possibilities (which no doubt will continue in novels and comic books) for further adventures. \\"Serenity\\" manages to be that rare thing in science fiction films; a kick-ass adventure with some thought behind it. While some of the plot points that are revealed in \\"Serenity\\" are a bit predictable the film manages to combine the best elements of space opera and science fiction to create valentine for fans of the show.<br /><br />\\"Serenity\\" looks extremely good on this DVD with the original theatrical presentation of the film well represented. The colors are vivid and bright where appropriate and the clarity of the image exceedingly good. The one area that this transfer could improve is to eliminate the edge enhancement that appears in some of the high contrast sequence action sequences shot for the film. The 5.1 Dolby Digital presentation of the film nicely captures the active soundtrack from the theatrical exhibit of the film. Dialogue comes across crisp and clear while action sequences don't have the compressed muddy sound that I've seen in some recent releases.<br /><br />While the film looks and sounds very good, the extras leave a lot to be desired which makes me suspect Universal will be re-releasing this in a double dip edition later next year. I don't have news but I suspect the sales of this set will determine if an enhanced edition comes out next year (or perhaps Universal is holding that for the Blu-Ray edition that is no doubt in preparation for next year). We get three featurettes on the series the best of which \\"Future History: The Story of Earth That Was\\" clocks in at around 5 minutes. Whedon talks to the camera here explaining how he came up with the concept for the show. \\"What's in a Firefly\\" focuses on the optical effects with Whedon and members of the visual effects team discussing how they conceived some of the best visual sequences. \\"Relighting the Firefly\\" is the longest of the three at about 10 minutes and covers the resurrection of the show from the graveyard of cancelled TV shows. ***CAUTION THERE IS A SPOILER AHEAD ABOUT THE CONCLUSION OF THE FILM AHEAD. SKIP TO THE NEXT PARAGRAPH IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN THE FILM***While each featurette is of solid quality Universal should and could have done a separately disc of extras covering everything from what made it into the movie that was planned for the non-existent second season to Whedon's controversial decision to eliminate some of the major cast members for this film.<br /><br />Whedon's chatty commentary definitely ranks as the highlight of the extras included for me. The discussion of his thought process behind the film's plot and how he tied in various points from the series was refreshingly frank and fascinating to listen to. Whedon's impish sense of humor also gets a nice airing in his discussion on making the film.<br /><br />While the fact that this is truly the end of the \\"Firefly\\" saga will be a bitter pill for fans to swallow, Whedon delivers a truly stunning valentine with \\"Serenity\\" channeling the major plot points for a planned second season that never materialized. The image quality and transfer of \\"Serenity\\" is quite good but the extras a bit disappointing particularly compared to many lesser films that receive a DVD release. Whedon's commentary remains a highlight of this set. Definitely worth buying if you're a fan of the series although I'd suggest nonfans who haven't seen the TV show might want to rent some of the first season DVD boxed set to get a sense of the flavor of the show before buying.ross crisp and clear while action sequences don't have the compressed muddy sound that I've seen in some recent releases.

B000002BQK|5.0|People who tend to judge and criticise the music of Mariah do so based on the few singles they have heard rather than an indepth exporation of her key albulm tracks, many of which never got commercial release.  Butterfly marked a watershed in the career of Mariah; a fusion of urban beats and soulful ballads which continued  the direction  she had started to take in Daydream  with 'Fantasy' and wanted to follow up musically. Those only familiar with mariahs higger register will be suprised to find this albulm is a study in vocal restraint; the vocals croon over slick  beats and meander with the music to create sublime songs delivered with passion and heartfelt honesty.  <br />
B00007LTIB|5.0|Released in 1974, this would be the last studio album from Yes for at least three years until the debut of their triumphant 1977 album Going for the One.  Structurally, Relayer duplicates the format of Close to the Edge (1972) and as such is comprised of three pieces including the 21'55 epic The Gates of Delirium (it was Tolstoy's tome \\"War and Peace\\" that inspired vocalist Jon Anderson to put this epic together), in addition to the comparatively shorter pieces Sound Chaser (9'25\\") and To be Over (9'08\\").  In contrast with Tales from Topographic Oceans (1973), the energy levels are completely over the top on Relayer and may reflect the enthusiasm of new (Swiss) keyboardist Patrick Moraz.  I think its worth noting that Moraz was a first chair player and his contributions to Relayer are consistently brilliant throughout - as an exceptional talent with a unique playing style, it is unfortunate he was not with Yes for a longer period of time.<br /><br />Although the frenetic pace of Sound Chaser is exhilarating and the comparatively dreamy To be Over is a wonderful piece (Steve Howe's favorite apparently), The Gates of Delirium is my own personal favorite.  Would I be way off the mark to say that The Gates of Delirium is the most well constructed large-scale composition in all of progressive rock?  Being a huge Yes fan, it would be impossible to remain objective, but then again I have listened to a lot of prog and this composition really stands out.  Over a period of 15 minutes or so, this multi-movement suite gradually develops into a wildly churning sonic maelstrom, with the sounds of shattering glass and the clangorous racket of metal on metal (they collected parts from the junkyard to create this effect) swirling around and fighting with violent and white-hot synthesizer lines, Squires thundering bass parts, and Steve Howe's absolutely manic guitar playing.  Just when it appears that the CD player might actually erupt in flames (or wrench itself loose from its moorings), the chaos gradually dissipates into soft, muted textures, which then give way to the beautiful and gentle closing movement \\"Soon\\".  Soon is a deeply emotional piece of music and Trevor Horn (he provided vocals on the Drama album 1980) has been quoted as saying that it \\"brought him to tears\\".  This piece was eventually abstracted from the larger composition and issued as a single, which has been included on this remastered disc along with a studio run-through of The Gates of Delirium and a single edit of Sound Chaser.  As somebody who once owned this on vinyl, the bonus tracks do not really enhance my enjoyment of the album although they are OK.<br /><br />The musicianship on this album is mind-numbingly virtuosic and as I have mentioned, Patrick Moraz is outstanding.  Even Alan White (Bill Bruford once condescendingly referred to him as a good \\"rock\\" drummer) provides some great drumming on Relayer, especially on Sound Chaser and it is probably his best recorded performance.  Chris Squire once again demonstrates what it means to be a world class bassist and presents bass parts that range from the subtle to the impossibly difficult, while Steve Howe plays like a man possessed, with scalar runs played at breakneck speeds.  OK I need to slow down - just thinking about this album makes me completely hyper.<br /><br />The remastering on Relayer is wonderful and the CD package comes with a great set of detailed liner notes and color photos - the information may be \\"old hat\\" for hardcore Yes fans but should ultimately prove of interest to most.  This is the real McCoy folks - progressive rock in all of its splendor.

B00005JO1Y|5.0|I am capable of liking and admiring movies of all shapes and sizes.  My favorites this year include CAPOTE and CRASH.  But sometimes nothing fits the bill for movie thrills better than an outstanding, outsized epic.  The kind of movie where you simply MUST see it on the large screen, with a large crowd.  This year, the \\"epic\\" films have been pretty disappointing.  Even crowd-pleasers like the third STAR WARS installment and WAR OF THE WORLDS mostly pleased at a surface level.  Others, like STEALTH, didn't please at all! <br /> <br />KING KONG is satisfying on an emotional level.  It satisfies on a visceral, action-loving, special-effects level.  It pleases those who appreciate good acting and directing.  It simply WORKS. <br /> <br />I'm dismayed at anyone who says the film is too long.  What the heck is wrong with sitting for three hours through something that is this rich, textured and exciting?  True, if it is three hours of boredom, you can get quite fidgety...but then again, 90 minutes of garbage will make me fidget too.  But if I've been immersed in a world so thoroughly conceived and presented, populuated by people who are interesting to know and engaged in a plot that is told in a gut-wrenching way...the movie seems short.  I won't say, \\"I didn't want it to end,\\" because in actuality, the film has a rich beginning, a thrilling middle and an emotionally wrenching end.  I had been taken through a complete story, and I didn't need more.  It was just right. <br /> <br />I won't run down the plot.  But I will touch on some key elements.  First of all, the special effects are special. I was most blown away by the loving detail lavished on recreating depression-era New York City.  In the opening scenes, and in the big finale, NYC is beautifully rendered...I doubt we'll see it so loving done again.  It's a city on the brink of a collision between massive progress and massive poverty.  The new and shiny versus the old and decrepit.  Technology against a giant beast.<br /> <br />The action sequences are like nothing you've seen before.  There's a protracted sequence when Kong battles three velocoraptor-like beings while trying to keep Naomi Watts alive.  It is breathtaking..in the best way...it makes you hold your breath.  Later, the sequence a top the Empire State Building is damn near perfect.  It feels so cold, lonely and primal up there, and Peter Jackson films everything from angles that quite literally leave you dizzy.  A couple of scenes were still a bit rough, though, to be fair.  The scene in which the explorers all flee from underneath the giant legs of a stampeding brontosauruses doesn't quite convince.  It shows it's green-screen seams.  But overall, this is some of the best stuff ever.  Kong himself is simply great...totally convincing. <br /> <br />Jack Black is well cast in a part that isn't as much against type as some would claim.  A driven, unethical ego-maniac.  That's not such a stretch, is it?  Adrien Brody is quite nuanced in his role...which was smaller than I thought it would be, but well done.  Kyle Chandler has a smallish role as the \\"star\\" of Black's new film, and he's really funny.  But it is Naomi Watts' show...every scene she plays is done with whole-hearted conviction.  Her interactions with Kong make you forget totally that he was NOT in these scenes with her.  It all feels completely authentic...which for such an outrageous story is pretty amazing.  She feels like an \\"old-time\\" star...all modern mannerisms, all modern irony are gone.   <br /> <br />Also, the scene on a frozen pond in Central Park is brilliant.  If you have a dry eye during that one (or God-forbid, during the final scene between Watts and Kong) I do feel bad for you. <br /> <br />Yes, the film requires an attention-span.  But it rewards with so many riches.  It is not a film for little kids, not because of the action, but probably because of the time it takes getting there.  I saw a lot of restless 8 or 9 year olds in the theater.  But I saw a lot of 13 year olds (including my own) totally enthralled.  And I even caught myself literally on the edge of my seat.  I NEVER do that...I'm far to \\"cool\\" to get that caught up in a film...but the epic KONG made me feel like a kid at his first movie again.  Thanks, Peter Jackson, for that feeling.
B000B8QEYC|5.0|The \\"Amarantine\\" flower is a good metaphor for Enya's music, which seems to blossom eternally, and especially now. This new album brings the best from Enya: it is melodical, moving and touching, more than ever. The title song is truly addicting, and my other favorites are the emotional \\"If I Could Be Where You Are\\" and \\"Sumiregusa\\", the upbeat \\"Somebody Said Goodbye\\" and the instrumental \\"Drifting\\".  <br />And one final favorite of mine: if you like Enya's music, you will love Arye Geiman, a very romantic composer, whose music really awakens your imagination. You can listen to it at the \\"CDbaby com\\" website.
B000ASATWQ|5.0|This is his best album yet with out a doubt,  <br />look at my ratings <br /> <br />1. Confrantation - 9/10 <br />2. Welcome To Jamrock - 10/10 <br />3. Road To Zion - 10/10, his best song ever. <br />4. It Was Written - 9/10 <br /> <br />These are my favourites. <br />This album is worth every penny!
0060977493|2.0|I'm a very big fan of Rohinton Mistry and was hoping this effort by another Indian writer living in Canada might be similar in quality. It isn't. After just 20 pages, I was struggling to figure out what the plot might be, who was related to whom, and mainly, why I should care about any of the characters. After 40 pages .... I gave up. The writing isn't good enough to carry the book. The style jumps from literary to casual modern to just plain unpolished and rhythm-free. The characters are uncompelling. There isn't much of a story. Roy has a long way to go to match Mistry. I can't understand how this won the Booker Prize.
B0000025RI|5.0|In my opinion, this album is proof that Michael Jackson is the greatest music entertainer ever!! I remember purchasing this album and playing it to death until Bad was released in 1987. The amazing thing was it never sounded dated - How could it with tracks like \\"Wanna be startin' something\\", \\"Thriller\\", \\"Beat it\\" and \\"Billie Jean\\" on it! It is almost like a greatest hits album!! <br /> <br />The album also set the standards for pop songs and pop videos - need I say more?? <br /> <br />Little wonder then that it is the biggest selling album ever!! This will continue to be so for many years to come I'm sure, ENJOY!!!!
B00008WD6T|5.0|If you are wanting some diversity from cool jazz to hip hop...whatever...if you are into funk jazz music that can get you up and happening or just lay back then this 2 cd set is one for your collection. I must admit that this CD was a surprise in the new adventure each song takes me through, everytime I play it. Great compilation as always from Blue Note. Can't say much else good about it without sounding wishy washy...man it is one of the best CDs in my collection of over 600 CDs...
0679422714|5.0|This book, like Wild Swans, is extremely well-written.  It is clearly written, which is surprising, since it is so heavily referenced.  You would expect the use of so many sources to cause the readability to diminish.  It doesn't.  Bravo to the authors for that.  Who knows whether it is really true or not?  How can this be determined without question?  What are the tests?  Easy - follow the references.  Anyone who wants to throw stones at such a fortress needs to check and report on the facts, or expect to be laughed at.  I live in China now.  I can tell you adamantly that there is no freedom of speech in China.  Mao's party rules the media.  How many Chinese people are still put into prison every month for daring to raise their voices on websites in China?  Dozens?  More?  It's true and easily verified.  So, is it possible for this book to be sold in China?  Is it possible for the world to know what the people of China REALLY think about Mao?  Not yet.  Maybe someday, thanks to those who record the truth.  Thanks to Jung Chang. <br />
0385507755|5.0|This is the type of book that stays with you....and you want to share with everyone you know. <br /> <br />It is a true testimate to the human spirit- nothing is insurmountable.  <br /> <br />James Frey is an inspiration....and a brave man.  <br /> <br />A must, must read.
B00005JO1Y|5.0|Academy Award winning director Peter Jackson (the Lord Of The Rings trilogy) joins Academy Award winning actor Adrian Brody, Academy Award nominee Naomi Watts, and comedian Jack Black in the heart winning remake of the classic tale of King Kong.  <br /> <br />The movie pursues an eccentric 1930's film maker, Black, who takes off on an ocean voyage after getting scolded by his producers following a bad test screening to find the mysterious Skull Island where it was said is home to a monstrous creature. All that the director wants is to capture scenes from this island to put in his next movie to make millions. Accompanying him is an aspiring actress named Ann, played brilliantly by Watts, his writer, played by Brody, and the rest of the movie and ship crew.  <br /> <br />Cutting to the chase, King Kong, an enormous ape, is discovered on the Island occupied by grizzly natives who sacrifice Ann to him. What occurs between Ann and the ape is a heartwarming relationship. Ann discovers that the monstrous animal is not that monstrous, but playful, courageous and loyal. The scenes where Kong rescues Ann from the raging dinosaurs, including a few T-rexes, are reminiscent to Jurassic Park, but amazing action sequences that end with quite a laugh.  <br /> <br />The story evolves into a striking love story, not a romance, between the ape and Ann that end up in an incredibly rebuilt 1930's New York City, where Kong causes awe and havoc in the city, but all for the search of his lovely Ann where he sees a beauty that kills the beast within him. <br /> <br />It's a lovely tale, and you will feel pleased to watch it despite many criticisms revolving around differences between the original and this new version.  <br /> <br />King Kong will make you laugh, cry, and sit at the edge of your seat. Definitely one of the best movie experiences of the year! <br /> <br />Recommended <br /> <br />A-

B00009RAJI|5.0|Ah, the '70's.  They are but a distant blur in my memory.  Back then, in the summer that this album came out, we were listening to Hotel California, Frampton Comes Alive, and Rumours.  We'd play them so much, we'd have to put a penny on the needle of the record player.  Of course, if you were a true Mac fan it was mandatory to have the 45rpm of \\"Go Your Own Way\\", because that was the only way to get \\"Silver Springs\\", one of the delights that was mysteriously omitted from the complete album.  Mac wisely decided to include it here smack dab in the middle of the cd, where it certainly belonged all the time. One drawback though is that this version of \\"Silver Springs\\" is not the same version that was on the flip side of \\"Go Your Own Way\\": I would have preferred the original version.    Today, I find myself listening more to the bonus CD than the original, because some of the rough tracks and demos are just so darn good.  The Gold Dust Woman demo, in my humble opinion, is worth the price of the CD.  It's an acoustic, stripped down version that's just totally nailed by the band.  Another good demo that's better than the final cut is \\"Think About It\\", a song that Stevie Nicks put on her first solo LP-  this version is simply better.  The bonus track cd ends with a nice little jam session that rounds out the disc nicely. I do return to disc one regularly so I can listen to \\"The Chain\\", and \\"I Don't Want to Know\\", two of my personal favs.       Overall, this disc is a better choice for the fan, who, like me, grew up listening to this album.  You definitely get your money's worth here, as well as a look into how the band refined their music.  This was the biggest album of the '70's and for good reason. It still brings a smile to my face after all these years.
1400032717|4.0|It is a great, well written book that can be an inspriration to others. Haddon defintely delivers a great novel and shows that autistic children can be just as smart as anyone else.
B0006GAI6Y|2.0|Unfortunately this American version of the wonderful Japanese film fails to capture the charm of the original.  Mr. Gere and Ms. Sarandon are perhaps miscast causing the off-balance feeling of the film and the depleted expectations.  Neither Gere or Sarandon do well as an \\"ordinary\\" Chicago couple who have fallen into the doldrums of a ho hum middle class lifestyle.  Ms. Lopez, however, is fine as the sexy dance teacher with dreams of ballroom stardom.  Despite their obvious attractiveness, there is an obvious lack of sexual energy between Mr. Gere and Ms. Lopez, which depletes the overall feeling of the film.  Ms. Sarandon could have phoned this performance in, as there wasn't much for her to do, but wonder where Mr. Gere was, when he wasn't returning home after work.  But even then, there was so little tension that Ms. Sarandon merely seemed vaguely worried, and not at all fearful that her husband might be stepping out. <br /> <br />Standard Hollywood plot.  The second leads, especially Stanley Tucci and his dance partner, were mildly amusing. <br /> <br />
B00005JO1Y|5.0|Before I get started, I find it very interesting that so many reviewers are knocking the length of the new King Kong, yet they've written reviews that are longer than term papers!<br /><br />Here goes:<br /><br />The 1933 original is a classic landmark film for it's time. Though very primitive special effects were available at the time, one cannot help admire the excellent screenplay.<br /><br />The 1976 remake should be trashed. Just terrible in every sense. Only good thing about the film is Jessica Lange. Kong looks like a guy in a costume, especially the way he walks upright like a human being.<br /><br />Peter Jackson's 2005 remake is excellent, but not perfect. The film captures depression era New York very well. The CGI is a marvel, Kong looks very real. The highlights for me were: the way Kong and Ann related, a re-telling of Beauty and the Beast; the way he tenderly held and touched her; how she slept nestled on his arm; the Central Park scene where Kong was slipping on the ice, NOT skating...a stroke of genius; and the climax atop the Empire State Building. What could have been toned down was the amount of prehistoric creatures (a little goes a long way). The insect scene added nothing to the film, and should have been cut. Finally, the battles between Kong and the prehistoric creatures, though impressive and thrilling, really moved way too fast for the eye and brain to focus on and capture. This seems to be a trend in Hollywood these days. Directors, please S-L-O-W  down the action scenes a wee bit so the audience can actually enjoy what they're watching. Recommended popcorn movie.
6304779607|1.0|The \\"plot\\" of this massive disaster is simple: Stallone's Detective Cobretti must track down an army of serial killers before they track down and kill witness/girlfriend Brigette Nielsen. After several dozen murders, Stallone tracks the killers down and blows them all away (except for the one he hangs on a hook and burns to death). The End. <br /> <br />Total Recall showed how extreme violence could be used to produce an imaginative, entertaining film. Cobra shows how extreme violence can be used to produce a multi-million dollar mess that makes you wonder if Darwin was wrong. It's basically a star vehicle slasher film during which victim after hapless victim is paraded in front of the screen to be slaughtered in the name of forwarding the \\"plot.\\" <br /> <br />With a resume filled with junk like this over the past two decades, it's no wonder Stallone's career has gone down the toilet.
B000001E7V|4.0|From the first track (Overcome) this album has you hooked. Tricky was a collaborator on Massive Attack projects around the same time this album was produced, and you almost feel like this could have been released under that groups name, but 'Maxinquaye' definitely displays more of Tricky's sensibilities than the group efforts produced by Massive Attack. <br /> <br />I'd give a track by track review, but it is easier to say that if you are a Massive Attack fan, you should have this album in your collection.
B000BKVQTS|1.0|\\"I'm a big Terry Gillam fan...Brazil was genius...but this movie will go down as one of the worst of all time! Boring story, painfully acted and visually dreadful. We wasted 60 minutes of our lives hoping it would get better before we finally gave up. I have never in my life asked for a refund until Brothers Grimm. The theater manager gave a knowing nod and cheerfully refunded us our money. Too bad I can't get a refund for those 60 minutes of my life that was stolen. Miramax/Disney should be ashamed for putting this film into release.\\" <br /> <br />Ditto--except I wasn't smart enough to ask for a refund! *slaps head* Needless to say, this is the only film I ever walked out of. It put my husband and me to sleep. We kept sitting there scratching our heads trying to figure out what was going on before eventually giving up.
1401308201|5.0|For anyone who may have been swayed by the incredibly innacurate review of this book by Shari Anderson, I would like to clarify something: Her review was not that of \\"Wicked: The Grimmerie\\", but of Gregory Maguire's novel \\"Wicked\\". She is right in saying that the originaly \\"Wicked\\" is a very slow piece of literature, I myself couldn't even stand to read the whole thing. You're better off just seeing the live show.<br /><br />However, \\"Wicked: The Grimmerie\\" is an incredible look at every little bit and piece of \\"Wicked\\" the SMASH HIT BROADWAY MUSICAL. I was counting the days until this book came out and I continue to pour through it several times a week, each time finding something new and interesting, even exciting about this show. I used to be really into Brodaway shows, but the poor content coming out of Brodway the last couple  of years had made me lose interest. That changed when I discovered \\"Wicked\\". I was lucky enough to see it on the touring production and I plan on taking a trip to New York to see it again. I have read every page of text in this book and every time I learn something new. Don't hesitate to pick up this book. Even if you haven't seen the show, this book will help you learn what to look forward to, maybe even get you motivated to see it! Buy the cast recording CD too. It's all worth it in the end!
0393327655|1.0|Now listen to this:  (Warning--Spoiler Ahead!) 1. There is no God.  2. Therefore  religious beliefs are mere superstition.  3.  Since superstitions are false by definition, there can be no God.  From this airtight reasoning Mr. Harris got an idea for improving the world:  Get rid of religion and replace it with a world government based on reason.  I heard this same idea a few months ago from some sophomoric twit attending the local community college, but Mr. Harris has written a book explaining it all, and has even gotten on C-Span!    Now, I havn't read the book, but I did see the C-Span show, but, as I missed the beginning of his lecture, I also  must have missed the part where he actually proved his premise that God doesn't exist.  I confess that I had been wondering about that very problem for some years now, but, being unable to come to any conclusion, I was glad to hear that Mr. Harris had finally found the answer.  I'm sure that when I look into his book I'll be quite embarassed for not having figured it out myself.
B000005IU2|5.0|There is just no getting around it. This may be one of the greatest rock and roll albums of all time, if not THE greatest. This is pure electricity. Pure hardcore raw muscle flesh and blood pumped up stoned out ripped open smashed in drunk wasted rattle your blood get your flesh vibrating rock. This is pure punk rock. <br /> <br />Consider this album was made in 1969. Think about that! 1969!1969!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Just think about it!!!!!!!!!!! Amazing!!!!!!!!!!! It blows my mind!!!!! What the heck was everyone else doing in 1969???? Wearing flowered bell bottoms and cranberry V-neck kimonos and listening to the Beatles!!! Well, I overstate, but still! <br /> <br /> This may be one of the most ahead of its time albums EVER. I don't know if I've ever heard punk rock that can compare to this. If you listen to it at full blast a few times I swear it's like being punched in the face and injected with adrenaline.  <br /> <br />All the songs on this are amazing. Full-throttle. One thing I'd like to point out is a lot of people seem to be saying \\"Dirt\\" isn't quite up to par with the rest of the album because it's a little slower and murkier. I disagree. Dirt is amazing. It blows away Jesus Lizard, the Cows, and Swans with one fell swoop. This is true punk sludge the way it should be played.  <br /> <br />(I love Jesus Lizard and Swans too, though)
1400032717|3.0|The book lacked information on a autism child, but the journey that he endures is powerful, and inspirational. A parent looking for information on autism should not look towards this book. OVerall the book has touching and surprising adventures.
B000AP04FG|3.0|I thought I would dislike this movie because it looked cutesy in the promotional trailers.  Well it is kind of cutesy but it's not a bad 2 hour ride.  The chemistry between Jolie and Pitt is quite good and the action sequences like their little fight were quite entertaining.  Pitt is his usual sarcastic and kind of egotistical self but he always plays that type of part quite well.  Jolie's character was also quite amusing but I'm not as familiar with her body of work so I can't compare her character to any of her other ones.<br /><br />You have to go into this movie expecting a lot of fluff with cool action sequences and some sarcastic shots at wedded bliss.  This isn't a big hollywood epic nor is it \\"deep\\".  It's just a fun popcorn movie with two of hollywoods best looking celebrities in it.  Good enough to warrant a sequel in my opinion..
B000BMSTMS|3.0|Give it a shot...what do you have to loose but to further learn what sounds you like from Korn and those you don't.  I personally love tracks 1-4, 9 (alright) and the song Appears, which was a bonus download. <br /> <br />After taking a first listen to this album, I was rather impressed with myself once I discovered that they did in fact have an individual from the NIN albums step in and offer some advice/direction.  During this time, I was thinking to myself, \\"...this sounds a lot like NIN and Marilyn Manson...\\"  They are, without a doubt, stepping away from the Welch era. <br /> <br />Brian \\"Head\\" Welch is gone.  Anyone who doesn't think this will not only affect their emotional state, but also their sound is dead wrong and should be wrong for even wanting it to be.  I felt Head left after one of Korn's most complete \\"Kornesque\\" albums (meaning it was most like their self-titled and the ever popular follow the leader).  The melody the guitar ensues is some of Welch's finest metal guitar work.  He will be missed regardless of Korn saying they can get along fine without him.  They are a DIFFERENT band now. <br /> <br />So what affect did this have on the current album?  It made them have to go in a new direction.  Even if they were planning this in the first place, they had to account for the loss of not only his skill, but an additional guitar.  What did they replace it with?  Crappy filler for the most part brought to the project by producer Atticus Ross (Nine Inch Nails).   <br /> <br />It is not that it isn't decent music; it's the fact that it is just decent music that is the problem.  Korn is much better than the majority of this album.  The first 4 songs and Appears draw slightly off what Atticus brought to the table, but stays closer to their sound and talents that make them so successful, which is why I enjoy them.  As for the rest of it, you might as well go pick up a good NIN album or give Manson's Antichrist Superstar a try.  I am sure they wanted to expand their sound and rediscover themselves after the loss of Welch, but they far from succeeded and took steps towards a sound that is tired and has been over done.
0446577383|1.0|This book is the most anti-American book I have ever read. I'm sure the \\"New York Times\\" will love it. Not only is it poorly written, it fails to ever get off the ground as a \\"thriller.\\" Thriling it is not. The characters are flat and their dialog so stilted to the left that they all sound like Cindy Sheehan. This anti-American tripe is so far out that it will no doubt be scooped up by Hollywood as it continues to advance the political agenda of the far left. My copy is going straight into the trash; I would hate to have a part in the distribution of this worthless rubbish. What happened to the David Baldacci I used to read and love?  I guess Hollywood got to you too.
6303492509|5.0|I really liked this movie the 1st and only time I saw it. When me and my boyfriend first moved in together, he showed me this movie because he really liked it... well, after watching it my VCR ate the tape during rewinding! I just bought this for him because he probably would never think this would be a Christmas present of his, but I'm glad to finally replace it. It is a very good movie with a quite interesting and strange plot. I can't wait to watch it again!
B000AARKOO|3.0|I have some complaints agains this film that had they been eliminated, would've made the film great.  <br /> <br />First, the red-bearded man who has been in Braveheart, Troy, and countless other movies, playing the same guy over and over. He was just too much. I'm sick of Hollywood using certain actors in very specific roles in virtually every movie released.  <br /> <br />Second, what gives with the music from '13th Warrior' during Orlando Bloom's speech? This is about as bad as Ridley Scott's other idiotic move of using music from 'Zulu' in the movie 'Gladiator'. Enough already, use a totally original musical score!! <br /> <br />Third, I had no idea that howitzers existed in the 11th Century or earlier. I know that catapults and trebuchets were powerful weapons for the age, but they didn't cause explosions and they certainly didn't impact with the speed of a gunpowder weapon. Nor could they be fired with the frequency of a cannon. Ridley Scott's depiction of these weapons is far too crazy, and just ridiculous.

0393327655|3.0|Ever see the Mosquito Coast?   There was this broccoli farmer who hired a genius, Allie Fox, to help him harvest his crops better.  Allie did him one better and built a refrigerator.  The farmer was frustrated that Allie didn't do what he was asked to do:  make a machine that speeds the harvest. <br />Allie was frustrated with the lack of understanding in society and wanted to strike out on his own (in the jungles of Central America) and build a new, perfect society.   <br /> <br />When the farmer found out that that was happening, here's what he said to Allie's son (played by the late River Phoenix):   <br /> <br />\\"You're father is the worst kind of pain in the neck:  He's a know-it-all whose sometimes right.  He's a very dangerous man.  You tell him that, Charlie.  He's a very dangerous man.\\"    <br /> <br />The old farmer proves to be right..   <br /> <br />The family ultimately is driven to ruin because Allie would rather be delusional than compromise his thesis on life.  I always related well to Allie Fox..    <br />and I see the danger of being like him.   <br /> <br />Sam Harris faces this danger, I think.  His book, \\"End of Faith\\" most likely came to him in a flash following 9-11 and he hammered it out in a fevered pitch until it was published.    <br />It reads with razor sharp clarity with ever \\"i\\" dotted and every \\"t\\" crossed.  I know.  I'm an atheist and have thought these things through for many years.    <br /> <br />His thesis is well crafted and covers all the tedium that is required to build a bullet-proof case.    <br /> <br />So, what's wrong with the thesis?   <br /> <br />He gives his fear of the the irrationality of religous people for more credence than any belief that other motives for the terrorism we are seeing today could be controlling their behavior. <br /> <br />While he is technically correct with all arguments,  the thesis is more a complete painting, than a derivation of a true thesis.   <br />Harris paints the picture he sees.   <br />In that picture,  faith is the killer of civilization.    <br />Moderate or fundamental.. it leads to the end of us all.. unless you profess Jainism or Budhism which are live-and-let-live religions.    <br />The painting includes the ills of Christian past, and they are many (and I suspect there will be more).   <br />It includes the ills of Muslim terrorism including a refutation that terrorism is economically or educationally based.   <br />He cites examples of very educated and mainstream people, as the ones in England, getting involved in bombings.    <br />The painting washes over the arguments of Chomsky and the like that the Muslim response is a reaction to US policy. <br />   <br />In fact,  he boldly states that the US has moved beyond its odius stage (as demonstrated in the Mai Lai massacre in 1968) to being a well-meaning giant.    <br />The people that carried out those atrocities are still alive.    <br />I don't know how much time has to pass to \\"be past\\" something,  but on the Harris time scale,  Osama still has a chance at redemption. <br /> <br />Why don't I like the painting that Harris makes?    <br />Because he ignores two things:    <br />1) for lack of better word, the \\"human spirit\\".    <br />2) any acknowledgement of how the methodical use of political might might be interpreted by those on the receiving end.   <br /> <br />He paints pictures of all the evil despots of the past and makes black-and-white examples of how they'd wield power compared to the way we well-meaning-giant Americans do.    <br />Since it's hard to tell when the salt is missing from the soup, let me add it here:    <br />He makes a point in one of his scenarios that if we had a weapon that could commit no colleratal damage and gave it to US leaders, Osama, and Hussein,  the use of that weapon would find much more use by the Muslims (or Hitler or Stalin). <br /> <br />So, let's extend the model to more American leaders, since we can't be comparing anyone currently inpower with Hitler, Stalin, or Osama:    <br />What would FDR do?   <br />What would Truman do?   <br />What would Kennedy do?   <br />What would Johnson, Nixon, Carter, or Reagan do?     <br />Let's see:   Tokyo (burned to the ground),  Hiroshima,  Nagaski,   South Vietnam, North Vietnam, Cuba, East Timor, Panama, Haiti, Greneda, and Nicaragua.   <br />What was it that Nixon said?  Kill everything that moves?    <br />We haven't moved on...   and we should always be very wary of applying the force of the well-meaning-giant.   <br />Perhaps we should limit it to cases where we are asked (by the victims).   <br /> <br />And for the human spirit?   <br />I think the picture he paints of the Muslim world is highly technical and extremely unfair.    <br />We are all human and capable of despicable actions as has been demonstrated.    <br />But, perhaps there is a more rich explanation of the \\"mad\\" suicide bombings than 72 virgins bathing in milk and honey (or whatever it is). <br />I personally would not die for that purpose, but there are purposes for which I would die:   <br />to protect my family or even my community...    <br />it would be a personal choice in personal defense.   Maybe this sort of motivation is playing a role with the Muslims. <br /> <br />This is different that the crimes of Christian past in that they were instituted by state power on weak people.    <br />In the Muslim case, it is weak people exacting the only force they have on strong people.   <br />I see no mention of this in the picture that Harris has painted and it is a very important distinction.    <br />Worse,  his picture incites fear among us which, as he well understands,  is a belief that could lead to action...  action based on a belief he created..  perhaps a faith.    <br />So he bears responsibility for motivating action that I would see as ill-founded and regrettable.    <br /> <br />... back to human spirit:    <br />Perhaps the suicide bombers see the US, because of its policies and actions, as a threat to their way of life IN THEIR OWN COUNTRIES.    <br />Notice, there are no Arab bases in the US.   <br />There are no SOFA's (status of forces agreements).   <br />No one from an Arab nation is demanding regime change over here.    <br />We however,  are doing all of that.   <br />Maybe we mean well.    <br />But does it matter? <br /> <br />I mean well when I tell my wife that she needs to work out more.   <br />I assure you,  it doesn't help.  At all.    <br />Perhaps the educated people who are motivated to act are not acting on a mission from Allah as much as they are acting as a response to a sense of urgent threat to the survival of their way of life.   <br />Perhaps the rise of fundamentalism in Muslim countries has many sources:  the enormous class division perpetrated by the ruling class over everyone else.  The extreme poverty and lack of hope of the poor.   <br />People want answers.   Clerics provide them.   And so it is here.   <br />Again, we are painting pictures,  not deriving ultimate truths.    <br />We all look and interpret.   <br />For me, and I think many,  a moral life is one in which we encumber each other only to the extent that is necessary for the group to live.   <br />That is,  we mind our own business as much as possible, but when your business involves me, then I should play some role in those decisions.    <br /> <br />There will always be the odd nut that wants to kill people because some \\"mandate\\", but as long as he or she has no far-reaching power,  it's irrelevant.   <br />One crime and the problem is contained. <br /> <br />The \\"well-meaning-monster\\" has been tried before.   <br />It turns into a regular monster all too easily, so perhaps it's best to just not be monsters and let people be..    <br />  <br />and maybe we'll get along better than Harris fears.
B000BKVQTS|4.0|this is a fun action movie.  it is funny and dark without being terribly violent and certainly not overly sexual, so it's very kid safe.  it's just a fun movie to sit back and enjoy!!  heath ledger and matt damon are hillarious together!!!  it's a very fun movie!
B00002ZMNV|3.0|Once again, Dolby Digital is used instead of the better sounding DTS. Each channel is sounding very forced, and it sounds like listening to several diffrent things at once rather than a multichannel audio DVD. The voice is really annoying in that the microphone is turned off between vocal parts, making each phrase sung rather startling. And the fact that they switched microphone information depending on which camera they were using is just distracting. It could've been a LOT better, but I don't regret buying it though.

B00004RF8J|2.0|If it aint broke, don't freakin' fix it. That's my motto, but apparently that's not Hollywood's policy at all, because they took this once dark masterpiece, this deliciously horrific piece of story-telling, and they tinkered with it. Rather than make things easier on themselves and just make a screenplay out of the original piece of work, they fiddled with it, and they farted with it. They took out songs (I.E. Mushnik & Son, Ya Never Know, Closed for Renovation), they added characters that didn't need to be in it (the masochistic dentist's patient. Sorry Bill Murray fans!), and the most unkindest cut of all; they changed the ending. That's right, if you haven't seen either the stage or theatrical versions, I won't spoil it for you, but be forewarned. All musical theatre purists will be disgusted. It's my understanding that they did in fact film it the way it was done on Broadway, but a test audience full of Hollywood knuckle draggers didn't like it. So, they had to change it. Go figure! But ... it's Hollywood, so what do you expect?  <br /> <br />This film does, however, have one thing that the stage play hasn't got. It's the ending song \\"Mean Green Mother From Outer Space,\\" which is my favorite musical theatre song of all time. That's the ONLY reason why I gave this two stars. I think I could have lived without that song, though, had they never written it, and left the ending alone.  <br />

B00005QDW1|3.0|This album just rocks !!! Though it's not nearly as good as \\"Return Of Saturn\\" it still rocks. Even though \\"Hey Baby\\" was the hit song played on the radio and MTV ( the video for that song was so clever ) there are songs on this record that are far supeior. Like \\"Making Out\\", with an awesome keyboard at the beginning and a fluid sounding bass,Gwen at her most seductivenes,how can you not resist this song. How can you not? Tell me.And \\"Detective\\".... you want to talk about the so-called wall of sound. This song will BLOW YOU AWAY !!! Great album.
B000AMJG4Y|5.0|I didn't know anything about the Final Fantasy series when I saw this film.  So, I didn't fully understand the story.  But, the animation in this is unbelieveably awesome.  Just the beauty of the animation is worth seeing.  The action sequences are superb.  Amazing piece of work.  If you're an animation fan or fan of manga and art, this is a definite must.
0743454537|5.0|This is the first Jodi Picoult book I ever read.  I had always considered her to be a \\"women's lit\\" writer, and had never paid much attention to her novels.  Was I wrong or what?  I was immediately taken with the premise of the novel: a 13 year old girl wants to be medically emancipated from her parents because she feels she doesn't have any say in being a \\"guinea pig\\" or \\"spare parts\\" for her terminally ill sister dying of leukemia.  I have to admit it was a hard read at first as Ms. Picoult wrote each chapter from the POV of a different character.  However, once you got into the book and story, I could not put the book down.  Since the book has been out for a long time and a lot of people have read it, I don't feel bad about giving away the ending.  I say to the other readers/reviewers here on Amazon: real life doesn't always work out the way you want it.  If you are expecting a feel-good, isn't-life-wonderful, wasn't-that-a-miracle? ending, don't bother.  The ending will devastate you.  As another famous writer once said, \\"I don't write the story; the story writes itself.\\"  In reality, the dying sister would probably not have lived as long as she has.  I don't see the ending as a \\"yank the rug out from under you\\" literary trick.  I see this book as the ultimate example of irony.  It should be taught in high school English classes as such.  It makes the traditional stories to represent irony like O. Henry's \\"Gift of the Magi\\" pale by comparison.  Although I too was shocked and disappointed, I respect Ms. Picoult for keeping it real.  Looking back, I can see no other ending; the story writes itself.  In real life, people you care about die. Characters you have come to care about die.  For all our medical advancements, adults and children with leukemia die.  Donors die tragic deaths in traffic accidents.  The ending of this book has left a lasting impression on me; don't take life for granted.  Enjoy what you have while you're here.  If you are looking for a book toread passively and not be affected by its messages or themes, this is NOT the one to read.  Read something by Jane Green or Nora Roberts.  If you want a book with some deep ethical and philosophical issues to wrestle, pick this up.  But don't say you haven't been warned. You may not like how the story turns out, but I guarantee you: YOU WILL NEVER FORGET IT.  (No matter how much you'd like to).
B000AGTPUU|1.0|My girlfriend wanted to see this.  I had doubts.     I had read the book--if \\"read\\" is the right word for a book with no plot.  It was pretty and aimless, and I wondered how they could make a movie out of it.    They did it by stuffing it with miles of howling rollercoaster scenes, some not-very-magic magic characters, and more howling rollercoaster scenes.    Half the characters are voiced by Tom Hanks; the other half are voiced by Tom Hanks talking through a handkerchief.    A boatload of money was spent on this.  The computer animation is dazzling and whizbang--but never ceases to be dull.    The main reason for the dullness is the lack of charm of the characters.  They are often sentimental, but never truly warm.  And the computer-animation gives them a waxy, corpse-like look.    They all look like underdone refugees from a Tim Burton movie.    I wondered if children might like it, so I asked a friend who teaches 5-year-olds.  She had read them the book, which they liked, and asked those who had seen the movie if they like that too.  They didn't.  They said it was dull.    Christmas turkey.
0385335482|4.0|Becky Bloomwood has left home in order to share a flat in London with her friend, and to write for the magazine \\"Successful Saving\\".  The irony is that rather than do any saving herself, Becky chooses to spend her small paycheck--and then some!  When letters from her creditors begin to get nasty, Becky hides them and, in order to make herself feel better, she goes on another shopping trip.  She imagines all sorts of ways to become rich enough to pay off her debts--from winning the lottery to marrying a wealthy man.  None of her schemes seem to work, however, and she finds herself deeper and deeper in debt.  This is an amusing book whose main character is recognizable to anyone who is a shopaholic or who has a friend who falls in that category.  Nothing deep here, but it is a fun read.
B000AP04FG|3.0|I'm sure the two stars, director, and studio behind this action packed film would prefer that the film had a better reputation as the film that started the whole \\"Bradgelina\\" scandal. But the tabloid fodder that this pairing created, along with Jennifer Aniston, will forever be linked to this film, casting a shadow over it. I know some people who refuse to even see this movie because of what happened. I'm not saying you should see this movie, even though I liked it, but you should see it for yourself instead of letting outside forces rule your choices. As far as simple mindled summer/popcorn films go, this one is actually pretty good. It's definitley not great, but it's not bad. It could of been a lot better and they definitley could of taken it a lot further. What I wasn't expecting from the film was the humor. I just didn't think of it being there. But it was and it was nice to have. Kind of a \\"Lethal Weapon\\" funny, but not as much. Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie star as husband and wife. John and Jane Smith. Can it get any more blander and average?. Both seem to be living the normal upscale suburban life with both of them having careers. What neither of them know is that both are top assassins, and when they leave for work in the morning, they are killing people and blowing things up. Things get a little nasty when both of their agencies find out about their marriage and decide that it's not good image-wise, and set up a plan for the two to take each other out. The duo find out and start battling, until they realize they really love each other and team up to stay alive. The premise of the movie is pretty fun and it definitley has potential for a lot of great set up. Fortunatley, some of that potential is here. Unfortunatley, it's not enough. The movie moves along pretty quickly and once things really kick in, there is not a real dull moment. But the movie is not as big and explosive and memorable as it wants, or should, be. The direction is pretty slick though andwell done, and our two stars are game. I haven't seen a lot of Brad Pitt films, but he fits real well into his role. Jolie is a little more cold. However, she is incredibly sexy here. Vince Vaughan has a small suppoting role as a friend/co-worker of Pitt's, and Adam Brody from \\"The O.C.\\" puts in a small side role as well. The presence of our two stars brings a lot to the table, and there is enough humorous moments and big action pieces to entertain. But it could of been so much more.
B00004BZ16|5.0|I just finished reading Harold Pinter's Nobel Lecture \\"Art, Truth & Politics\\". It is easy to see why he won the 2005 Nobel Prize for Literature. But while reading what he said about Nicaragua in the 80s, the Contras and Sandinistas, reminded me of being 19 or so when this album came out.<br /><br />As a US citizen living in a fairly Reagan-loving state (Arizona) and having been told that the Contras were the good guys, I couldn't quite figure out why this band would be for the other team. But such was the beginning of my political enlightenment. The Clash and other punk and alternative bands were the first messiahs of political truth for me in my little sheltered life.<br /><br />Now there are Rap albums and Hip-Hop albums today that are important and political like The Clash's were then, but except for the few songs that make the list for Top 40 radio...for listeners who are no longer educated enough to get the irony--those more radical songs are mostly shared between friends and played late at night on College-Indy stations.<br /><br />In Milan Kundera's book, \\"The Incredible Lightness of Being\\" The author reflects on Nietzsche's idea of Eternal Return, and the moral consequences we face by not living in a world where all things are repeated ad infinitum. He writes,<br /><br />\\"Not long ago, I caught myself experiencing a most<br /><br />incredible sensation. Leafing through a book on<br /><br />Hitler, I was touched by some portraits: they reminded<br /><br />me of my childhood. I grew up during the war; several<br /><br />members of my family perished in Hitler's<br /><br />concentration camps; but what were their deaths<br /><br />compared with the memories of a lost period in my<br /><br />life, a period that would never return?<br /><br />This reconciliation with Hitler reveals the profound<br /><br />moral perversity of a world that rests essentially on<br /><br />the nonexistence of return, for in this world<br /><br />everything is pardoned in advance and therefore<br /><br />cynically permitted.\\"<br /><br />I remembered that passage today as I read Pinter's speech, as well as this album by The Clash. Because there was a bittersweetness to the memory of these songs, but tinged with the idea that the truth is that there is perhaps an Eternal Return of the same, and thus something even more deeply, impossibly immoral about the fact that some 25 years later, we are still playing the part of Imperialist bullies, murderers and exploiters--more than ever--dispatching a hideous form of terror under the banner of democracy everywhere on our little globe. So maybe now that the truth is so intolerable, it will finally be powerful enough to bring action. And people will be held accountable? I hope so.<br /><br />Harold Pinter's speech is brilliant and can easily be found in a search on the web, or on the Nobel Prize site. I'm sure I will get many \\"not helpful\\" votes for this, but I hope that at least one person will take the time to read Pinter's words since mine are admittedly inarticulate and inadequate to the task.\\" <br /> <br />I remembered that passage today as I read Pinter's speech, as well as this album by The Clash.

0452284392|4.0|This is an interesting book and is easy to read. As a non scientific person I was glad not to come across any heavy math or complex theories but the book is still very intelligently written.<br /><br />The consquences of network theory look to be profound. In fact it seems to be a framework that you can use to think about many different issues and problems. So beyond the books examples of the network organisation of the Internet, cells, and so on you can use the idea of network theory and apply it to many other situations. I have found it quite useful in trying to understand certain economic effects in Europe, specifcally around the recent rise in Interest rates.<br /><br />A good book indeed. It will be interesting to read about future findings on complex systems theory which is going to be built on top of this network theory.
B0002U4A9K|3.0|Stephen Sommers used Dracula(1931 with Bela Lugosi), Frankenstein(1931 with Boris Karloff( and The Wolf Man(1941 with Lon Chaney, Jr.) to inspiried him to make the movie. He made a good story for Van Helsing, but he didn't think they were in a movie together before. Did he see Frankenstein Meets The Wolf Man, House of Frankenstein or House of Dracula?  <br /> <br />It was a good story. I'm fine with that. But what's with these monsters and the special effects? How is this like a vampire, Frankenstein or a werewolf? I am not seeing the same kind of monsters and the special effect that are in An American Werewolf in London, Curse of Frankenstein and Interview with the Vampire. I do like Van Helsing, but why isn't he Abraham instead of Gabriel?
B000BW7QWW|4.0|I own the Firefly box set, and have watched every episode in it several times.  This is possibly the best sci-fi series of the past twenty years.  I eagerly awaited Serenity, and hoped it would cause the series to be revived. <br /> <br />Well, as soon as I saw the movie (on the first day) I knew it wasn't going to happen.  The movie is a little too intense and frenetic for non-fans to follow, in my opinion.  While it was fun (and I'm sure I'll pick up more details after watching the DVD a few times), I didn't come away thinking it was a classic by any means.  So, four stars.  There ya go, a Firefly fanboy who doesn't automatically give the movie five stars. <br /> <br />Nonetheless, it would be great if the series came back.  Isn't that what the SciFi Channel is for?

B000B8QEZG|4.0|Sometimes I wonder what I would do without MTV.  I was able to stream the entire Confessions album before its release on The Leak at MTV.com; so, if this review is early, (1) you'll know why and (2) that it's legit.<br /><br />I really like Madonna.  My fondest memories of her are from the late 90s, when after the Sex book and Erotica album, she came out with Bedtime Stories... which completely blew me away and made me forgive her for all the crap she'd given us in the name of pushing the envelope.  (Not to say that I don't appreciate the evolution process.  Fortunately, I can see the artistic value in a lot of what was made during the Erotica years.)  Nevertheless, Bedtime Stories and then Ray of Light made me love Madonna just as I had growing up with Like A Virgin.  Only this time, she seemed smarted, more relevant, truer... grown up.  And she was.  Ray of Light will always be my favorite Madonna album... because I too felt \\"like I just got home.\\"  Those lyrics still resonate with me.<br /><br />I've never been more excited about an album as I am with the release of Confessions... especially after American Life, which I wasn't too keen on.  (The production value could have been so much more.  But the Love Profusion remixes were really outstanding.)<br /><br />Anyway here's my blow-by-blow of the new album:<br /><br />Hung Up - By now you've all heard it... unless of course you're living under a rock.  And for that reason I'm not going to go into detail.  I wouldn't necessarily say this track is indicative of the rest of the album.<br /><br />Get Together - I almost fell over when I heard this.  It's amazing from beginning to end.  It's a heavy synth track with really cool, smooth vocals that seem to layer on top of each other; it gives the song a lot more depth during the chorus and sounds really good.  And the beat is simply incredible, a bit Stardust inspired (Music Sounds Better With You).  This is a whimsical, airy, and very sexy track.  And I'm not sure what the musical term for it is, but it's got a great build up, and in that sense, reminds me a bit of Hyperballad by Bjork.<br /><br />Sorry - They say this is going to be the second release off the album.  I hope so; it'll be a great radio-play dance song.  It's got a sort of a Jackson 5 thump-thump that's especially apparent at the beginning of the song.  I think it has a hard time getting off the ground though after following Get Together on the track listing.  But half-way through it, you realize, \\"Hey, this is pretty sharp.\\"  The chorus is extremely catchy; so, beware earworms.<br /><br />Future Lovers - A Donna Summer inspired track a la \\"I Feel Love.\\"  I Googled the chorus; apparently she's saying, \\"Give me evidence of its brilliance.\\"  I like this one; it's fun to dance to, but it's obviously a b-side and, unfortunately for some of us, this will never see the light of day (get airplay).  ...A great bridge to the next song nonetheless.<br /><br />I Love New York - This is the most rock-sounding song on the album.  Unfortunately, the lyrics suck.  This could have been a really great track and possibly something for radio play.  (The music lends itself to that well.)  I dunno.  It's fun and cheesy... something I would expect from ole Britney Spears.  But it's an appropriate end to what I would call the first act of the album.  There's an obvious downturn as this song leads into the next two tracks.<br /><br />Let It Will Be - Ahhh.  The 80s.  (Don't mind the strings.  Wait until it picks up; you'll get it.)<br /><br />Forbidden Love - Okay.  I absolutely HATED this song when I first heard it.  But listening to it in the context of the whole album on those days in rush hour traffic actually didn't kill me, make me want run someone over, or throw my radio out the window.  Granted, the song starts out overly dramatic.  Oh, Madonna!  Then comes the Daft Punk style chorus followed by a nice little thump thump that actually sound a lot like an old Kylie song.  It stillsounds a little downtempo but redeems itself in the chorus.  LOVE the chorus!  It just makes you wanna wave your hands in the air like some old queen on the dancefloor.  The \\"praise Jesus\\" stance.  Love this song... this block of songs actually because the next track is AMAZING!<br /><br />Jump - Put your dancing shoes on girl!  You're gonna love this song.  I'll be very surprised if it's not released as a single.  I love what she's singing about; it's got a positive message and a great 70s beat.  Love the high-hat!  Let's go dancing ya'll!<br /><br />How High - I would say this is the most Kylie-sounding track on the album.  And it reminds me a bit of \\"Come Into My World\\" from the Fever album.  (Not lyrically of course.)  I like the lyrics though.  I know they're about what she goes through and has gone through in life, but I think a lot of us can relate in our own ways to the personal and professional life choices she sings about.  Though it's a downtempo and probably won't be released, I find this to be one of the more outstanding songs on Confessions.<br /><br />Isaac - I have no idea what this song is about... haven't really listened to the lyrics.  Apparently it's caused a lot of ruckus among Kabbalist leaders because of who it's supposedly based on.  Whatever.  What really grabs me about it is the chorus, which has a lot of humming a la \\"Frozen.\\"  And I like that.<br /><br />Push - This song reminds me of \\"Don't Stop\\" from Bedtime Stories... maybe a tad slower BPM.  Supposedly, it's about Guy Ritchie (thanks Towleroad), which from the lyrics would make sense.  It's the most R&B sounding track on the album and has a catchy chorus.  It's okay; not an absolute favorite.  I think the chorus and bridge is what makes it.<br /><br />Like It Or Not - Yeah.  I think the album really ends with \\"Push\\" because this last one here is... well, it's gonna have to grow on me.  I really don't know what to say about it.  It's kind of how I feel about \\"Mer Girl\\" from Ray of Light.  I guess if the album were a workout, this song would be the cool down, which is really just meant to let you down easy and say, \\"Okay, thanks for coming!\\"  I mean really, does anyone truly stick around for the credits after a movie?  Maybe a little cartoon afterwards... or bloopers, but come on.<br /><br />All in all, Confessions is an incredible album.  The vocals are great - no straining, easy to sing-a-long (for those of us who like to).  Production value an A+.  Hook the ole lady up and pick up a copy of this album TODAY; it'd be a great addition to any CD collection.<br /><br />Certified QM rating: 4/5 starsn old Kylie song.  It still sounds a little downtempo but redeems itself in the chorus.  LOVE the chorus!  It just makes you wanna wave your hands in the air like some old queen on the dancefloor.  The \\"praise Jesus\\" stance.  Love this song... this block of songs actually because the next track is AMAZING! <br /> <br />Jump - Put your dancing shoes on girl!  You're gonna love this song.  I'll be very surprised if it's not released as a single.  I love what she's singing about; it's got a positive message and a great 70s beat.  Love the high-hat!  Let's go dancing ya'll! <br /> <br />How High - I would say this is the most Kylie-sounding track on the album.  And it reminds me a bit of \\"Come Into My World\\" from the Fever album.  (Not lyrically of course.)  I like the lyrics though.  I know they're about what she goes through and has gone through in life, but I think a lot of us can relate in our own ways to the personal and professional life choices she sings about.  Though it's a downtempo and probably won't be released, I find this to be one of the more outstanding songs on Confessions. <br /> <br />Isaac - I have no idea what this song is about... haven't really listened to the lyrics.

B0009I7NNA|5.0|avenged sevenfold are awsome and they are such one of the bestest band of metal or hardcore... they grown up so fast and u can see it in this album... they are influenced by mettalica and u can see it i think that they would be awsome or better than mettalica... m shadows have a great voice. the music is hard and u can see it i dont think that ''bat country'' is the bestest song u can see that their songs are very powerful like ''thrashed and scattered'' at the first time that i read bout that band i thought that they were a joke tryin to be the new metallica but when i listen to ''unholy confessions'' i knew that they would be awsome and they are but in this cd they are better than i thought now i cant get enough of ''trashed & scattered'' but anyways their songs are awsome and i think that they gonna be better than metallica
B0000DZEA1|2.0|The score functions in its role adequately enough, but the notes lack the spirit of works by more refined composers such as Harry Gregson-Williams or Patrick Doyle.  The main LOTR theme sounds good enough, but the rest of the score is sheer boredom.   <br /> <br />There is a dynamic, emotional quality that is completely missing from Shore's effort, and the score comes accross as something akin to 'elevator music' as a result
B000957O82|4.0|The story is old fashioned. A love doc who helped others, later fell in love, and eventually found out what love really was. It stood above the rest because of, first, the chemistry between the ever enchanting Will Smith and the main supporting actor who played a fat lousy accountant going after a beautiful blonde celebrity, and second, the very intelligent scripts, such as:-<br /><br />- 60% of all human communication is non verbal body language. 30% is your tone. That means 90% of what you are saying aint coming out of yoru mouth.<br />- A beautiful woman doesnt know what she wants, until she sees it.<br />- Listen and respond.<br />-Life is not the amount of breath you take. It's the moments that take your breath away.<br />- With no guile and no game, there's no girl.<br />- 8 out of 10 women believe that the first first kiss will tell anything they need to know about a relationship.<br />- The secret to kiss is to go 90% of the way and then hold, as long as it takes, for her to go the other 10.<br />- Begin each day as if it were on purpose.<br /><br />Dont tease me for copying those scripts. I like them very much and think I can improve my charm towards the opposite sex. Anyway, this is a good movie to kill time. Dont miss it.<br /><br />p.s. The several minutes in the opening will definitely become a classic. No exaggeration!
B0000042H4|3.0|Karajan in 5th place?! Karajan's is a wonderful recording -- lucid, balanced, and better quality sound than Solti. You'll hear orchestral details in this one you won't hear anywhere else.
B00000IPAX|5.0|With their 3rd major release, Blink-182 redefined the pop-punk genre that had been dominated by the Descendents, MxPx, etc.  Every song on this album has a certain catch or hook to it.  There is not a dull moment on this album, and I have listened to it more than any other album I own.  I consider myself an avid listener of music, as I have over 4000 songs now on my iPod ranging from death metal to reggae to classical, but no other cd over the years has quite caught my attention as this one has.  By far the defining album of Blink's carrer as well as a defining pop-punk album to close the 90s. A true classic, highly recommended.
0156027321|4.0|My daughter had to read this book as part of her summer reading program so I decided to read it as well.  I am glad I did.  It was a fun, easy read that wandered through the life of a clever, endearing character.
1400031087|1.0|FREY'S BOOK IS HANDS DOWN THE WORST BOOK ON ADDICTION I HAVE EVER READ, AND QUITE POSSIBLY EVER WRITTEN FOR THE SIMPLE REASON THAT IT IS IN NO WAY BASED ON FACT. <br />THE AUTHOR STARTS OUT THE BOOK STATING THAT HE CAME TO ON AN AIRPLANE 20 MINUTES BEFORE IT LANDED.  HE HAD A GAPING HOLE IN THE SIDE OF HIS FACE, WAS BLEEDING FROM THE MOUTH AND HEAD, AND WAS COVERNED IN URINE, BLOOD, AND VOMIT, ETC.  FIRST OF ALL, NO MAJOR COMMERCIAL AIRLINE IS GOING TO LET SOMEONE IN THAT CONDITION ON AN AIRCRAFT.  THAT'S NOT ONLY A RULE AIRLINES FOLLOW, IT IS PART OF F.A.A REGULATIONS.  NOT TO MENTION THAT HE WAS UNATTENDED.  HE CLAIMS THAT A DOCTOR BROUGHT HIM ON, AND TOLD THE FLIGHT CREW TO JUST LET HIM SLEEP.  WHAT KIND OF A DOCTOR PUTS SOMEONE WHO IS CLEARLY IN NEED OF IMMEDIATE MEDICAL CARE ON A PLANE INSTEAD OF TREATING THEM? CERTAINLY NOT A REPECTABLE ONE-BUT HEY, THIS IS FICTION AFTER ALL. <br />I HAVE BEEN TO HAZELDON, WHERE THIS BOOK TAKES PLACE.  FREY WOULD HAVE LASTED ALL OF 1 DAY IN THIS FACILITY IF HE DID ANY OF THE THINGS THAT HE CLAIMS HE DID. I HAVE ALSO BEEN TO TWO OTHER REHABS.  IF ONE PATIENT PHYSICALLY ASSAULTS ANOTHER, HARASSES/THREATENS/INTIMIDATES ANOTHER PATIENT OR STAFF MEMBER, THEY ARE DISCHARGED IMMEDIATLEY!!!! THIS IS A 'ZERO TOLERANCE', NO QUESTIONS ASKED POLICY, UNIVERSAL AMONG REHABS.  THE FACILITY MUST PROTECT THE WELLFARE & SAFETY OF ALL PATIENTS, AND IF MR. FREY, THE WANNA-BE BADASS IS TO BE BELIEVED HE WAS A THREAT, AND WOULD HAVE BEEN REMOVED.  WHAT HE CLAIMS HE DID COULD BE LIKENED TO BEING IN A REGULAR HOSPITAL AND HAVING THE PERSON IN THE NEXT BED,WAKE UP ONE NIGHT, START TO FREAK OUT, THREATEN YOU, PHYSICALLY HURT YOU, THEN PROCEED TO TRASH ALL THE FURNITURE IN THE ROOM, AND THE HOSPITAL STAFF DO NOTHING ABOUT IT.  HE WOULD HAVE BEEN SENT TO A PSYCH WARD OR SOMETHING.  <br />HE ALSO NEVER WOULD HAVE BEEN ALLOWED IN THE REHAB TO BEGIN WITH. SOMEONE WHO IS IN THAT KIND OF SHAPE MUST GO THROUGH A MEDICALLY MANAGED DETOX THAT THIS FACILTY DOES NOT OFFER.  HE NEEDED MAJOR DENTAL SURGERY, STICHES, AND HIS NOSE RE-SET.  ONLY WHEN HE HAD HAD THIS WORK DONE WOULD HE HAVE BEEN ALLOWED IN.  PATIENTS MUST HAVE A MEDICAL CLEARANCE IN OPRDER TO BE ADDMITTED. <br />IF A PATIENT DECIDES THAT THEY ARE NOT GOING TO COMPLY WITH RULES, OR DO THE WORK THAT THEY ARE GIVEN, THEY'RE OUT-IT'S THAT SIMPLE.  THERE ARE PLENTY OF PEOPLE OUT THERE WHO DO WANT THE HELP, AND MR. FREY WAS DOING NOTHING MORE THAN TAKING UP SPACE. <br />A COUNSELOR SPENDS APPROX. 4+ YEARS IN ORDER TO BE CREDENTIALED BY THE STATE IN ORDER TO WORK IN A REHAB. IT IS A LONG, DETAILED PROCESS. NO WAY IN HELL WOULD A COUSELOR DRIVE A PATIENT TO A REHAB TO PICK UP HIS GIRLFRIEND.  HE NOT ONLY WOULD HAVE LOST HIS JOB, BUT IT WOULD HAVE ENDED HIS CAREER. <br />SO FREY ALSO CLAIMS THAT HE KILLED A PRIEST IN PARIS WHO TRIED TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF HIM IN A CHURCH RECTORY.  I WILL NEVER BE ONE TO DEFEND THA CATHOLIC CHURCH FOR ALL ITS COVER-UPS, BUT COME ON, PLEASE!! THIS PART IS JUST SO CONTRIVED AND FAKE, IT'S ALMOST LAUGHABLE.  THE SAD PART IS, IT'S NOT LAUGHABLE-THIS IS A SICK BOOK THAT HAS THE POTENTIAL TO DO A LOT OF DAMAGE, ESPECIALLY TO THE PEOPLE WHO DON'T KNOW ANY BETTER. <br />I BOUGHT THIS BOOK BECAUSE THE HIGHER POWER PART OF THE AA PROGRAM HAS ALWAYS BEEN AN ISSUE FOR ME, ALTHOUGH I DO CONTINUE TO WORK THE PROGRAM ANYWAY.  I WAS EXPECTING TO FIND AN ENLIGHTENING TAKE ON HOW TO DEAL WITH THIS, ONLY TO DISCOVER THAT FREY HAD A HIGHER POWER WHETHER HE WAS AWARE OF IT OR NOT: HE USED THE TAO;THAT WAS HIS HIGHER POWER.  <br />IT'S SAD TO THINK THAT THIS BOOK COULD HAVE BEEN AN INSPIRATION.  I STOPPED GOING TO MEETINGS FOR 2 YEARS BECAUSE I BECAME TIRED OF THEM.  I WANTED SOMETHING DIFFERNET THAT I WAS NOT GETTING FROM AA. I AM BACK THERE NOW, AND IT HAS TAKEN ON A NEW MEANING FOR ME.  I CAN SAY THAT FREY MAY HAVE HIS REASONS FOR NOT WANTING AA (EVEN THOUGH HE PRACTICED SOME OF ITS MAJOR PRICIPLES), BUT IT'S FOR ALL THE WRONG REASONS: HE DOESN'T QUITE UNDERSTAND THE PROGRAM, OR WHAT IT'S REALLY ALL ABOUT. <br />THIS BOOK IS ACTUALLY VERY MEAN SPIRITED AND SADISTIC.  FREY KNOWS THIS IS A LIE, AND HE MUST BE THE MOST UNCONSCIONABLE PERSON TO WRITE A BOOK LIKE THIS, SENDING OUT A MESSAGE OF FALSE HOPE AND LIES TO SOMEONE WHO MIGHT BE ON THE VERGE OF ASKING FOR HELP, ONLY TO DECIDE NOT TO AFTER READING THIS PIECE OF TRASH. <br /> <br />OPRAH RECCOMMENDED THIS BOOK OUT OF IGNORANCE.  SHE DOESN'T KNOW ANY BETTER.  BUT TO THOSE OF US WHO DO, IT'S CLEAR RIGHT FROM AGE 1 THIS BOOK IS BY NO MEANS AMEMIOR-NOT EVEN CLOSE. <br />I DID NOT WRITE THIS REVIEW TO BE MEAN SPIRITED, AND COMPARE MY STORY WITH FREY'S.  I WROTE THIS TO HOPEFULLY EDUCATE SOMEONE, AND MAYBE EVEN HELP SOMEONE BEFORE THEY READ THIS BOOK.  IT'S NOT TRUE, AND THERE IS A BETTER WAY!!(NOT NECESSARILY AA EITHER. BUT, PLEASE DON'T TAKE THIS BOOK TO HEART, IT'S NOT WORTHY OF IT. <br /> <br />GOOD LUCK, AND BE WELL EVERYONE.
0596009208|5.0|We adopted this book for our first-year programming sequence at the North Carolina School of Science and Mathematics.  Our students begin their programming experience learning some Python.  Both C++ and Java are bad languages to teach buck beginners.  When I taught these to beginners I spent too much time untangling syntax and not enough on the core ideas of forking, looping and recursion.  Python lays these issues bare.  It also teaches good formatting habits. <br /> <br />Since our students know how to write simple procedural programs in Python, we wanted a book that assumed that ability.  Heads First Java picks up in just the right place.  We also wanted a book that emphasizes and exploits the fact that Java is an OBJECT ORIENTED LANGUAGE.  Many books treat Java exactly as if it were C++. They push inheritance and interfaces into the late chapters of their books.  Wrong!  Polymorphism and inheritance are bread and butter topics in Java.  Heads First gives them the early coverage they deserve.   <br /> <br />This book does a good job of getting the student to think in an object-oriented way.  It is doing a good job of preparing our students for the second-year course in Data Structures and Algorithms.

B0002Y4TM4|5.0|WOW! there are not enough stars to rate this album, an amazing sonic journey. <br />marillion has always been one of the best bands in the world, but since hogart join the band, it has just complete the circle with the other members of the band. <br />from the first sounds of invisible man the journey begins. <br />what can i say im not going to rate song by song , probably the weakest moments is drilling holes. and the best moments are invisible man,the only unforgiveable thing,neverland,fantastic place,angelina,ocean cloud,genie ,dont hurt yourself. excellent i mean really excellent songs. <br />and the lyrics oh man this can write,play and sing. <br />thats probably the biggest difference between fish and H. <br />marbles is in the same league as the all time great albums
B000696RIY|4.0|I'm a huge Britney fan, so when she came out with her Greatest Hits album, I was really excited. I would have giving it 5 stars but she did not include \\"From the Bottom of My Broken Heart\\" or \\"Don't Let Me Be The Last To Know\\". Why she included \\"Outrageous\\" is beyond me. I loved the remix bonus cd, especially the Chris Cox Megamix. All in all, this is a wonderful cd.
1400032717|5.0|The minute I began reading the curious incident of the dog in the night-time, by Mark Haddon, i thought about how parents of an autistic child will find this novel very helpful. The main character, CHristopher, had autism. He hated when anyone touched him. His parents found a way of expressing their love to Christopher, and it felt the need to share it in this review. This quote really touched me,  \\"He held up his right hand and spread his fingers out in a fan, and i held up my left hand and spread my fingers out in a fan and we made our fingers and thumbs touch each other\\"(87). THis was how they expressed their love. I think this book is great for autistic parents, for they will get an insight of an autistic child's way of thinking. I really like this book, and i'd refer it to anyone! MAGNIFICENT THOUGHTS THAT COME FROM A GREAT AUTHOR...WHAT MORE CAN YOU ASK FOR???
B000A6T1JU|4.0|i gave it 4 stars instead of 5 only because yes, the comic book approach takes away a lot from the original beauty of the film (if not totally butchers it)<br /><br />but im not saying the comic approach is bad!!!  i think i understand why Hill wanted to do this..<br /><br />well there are a couple possible reasons, maybe he's trying to fit it into a more modern comic-book-trendy style.. maybe he really did indeed intend the movie to be comic bookish to begin with as he says.. or maybe it is just marketing.<br /><br />well the new dvd release does coincide suspiciously with the rockstar game :)<br /><br />but you know what, this is bad and good..<br /><br />because to someone who isn't upset by the .. err . .  modification..  of their original beloved Warriors movie.. it makes an interestinglyh different movie!.. so if you have both versions, you can have the original and the strangely comic-bookized version..<br /><br />a problem though, im thinking a new generation of kids/young adults will see this movie, and think that is the way it was .. not seeing the beauty of the original version . .  especially the leagues of video-gamers it will probably draw in this time..<br /><br />the worst of all really...  the ending : (<br /><br />in the original untainted Warriors.. that isnt trying to cleverly repackage itself or mutate to market itself to new genres/trendiness..  the ending beach scene.. where the Warriors (or the remaining warriors at this point) all go walking away along coney island beach . .  for a very long while to the background while the credits are rolling..<br /><br />this was such a beautiful scene, maybe even my favorite of the film : D  that i almost cried when i saw it on television : D<br /><br />i know, call me tacky or whatever but it had such a wonderful aeshetic/poeticness to it . .  i was a loner at the time and it made me really want to join them, be part of the warriors/belong.. well this isn't a psychology thesis, so on with the review..<br /><br />and that was the worst shock last night as i watched this dvd release the first time.. they totally cut that for a stillframe of the comic frames.. and i knew right then and there 'this is a crime!!'  to the throngs of newcomers who will not even know the full beauty of the movie when they get this dvd..<br /><br />but like i say, if you can find the original, good, this one is good in its own way if you dont mind it being kind of mocked into the comic form..<br /><br />i think the only reason, frankly, they added the comic parts, were so they could even release it again and call it a directors cut..<br /><br />but i see lots of reviewers slamming Hill for the comic book thing.. its not really BAD !  in itself.. it is a cool idea really.. but i was shocked that they would totally change it like that..<br /><br />less shocking would have been if they actually just re-colorized or hyped up the visual to make it trendier ..<br /><br />with some sort of image program trickery, etc. .. to make it seem almost like a different movie.. well i dont know maybe thats a dumb idea..<br /><br />and yes, it ruined the beginning of the baseball fury encounter i thought..  i mean he pops on in a comic frame before you even have a chance to think 'hey where are we oh no who are these guys!!'<br /><br />a great movie!! by the way ..  yes it can be cheesy, tacky.. and i even caught some mediocre acting this time around..<br /><br />as i keep seeing this movie years after the last time i saw it..<br /><br />and seeing it in a slightly different way..<br /><br />and FULL of plot holes.. yes..<br /><br />and oh god...  much like a horror movie... they keep splitting up??<br /><br />my remote is broken so i cant access the featurettes yet : (<br /><br />but im looking forward to it, especially with the interviews with the original cast members..<br /><br />i was about to say im surprised an outright re-make of this movie hasnt been attempted yet.. the time seems ripe for it.. buti just found out that they are indeed looking to make one in 2006 . .  i was a small-time actor/model wannabe for a while, oh man what i wouldnt do to be in the remake of the Warriors..<br /><br />well thats all i have to say i guess, it is a great movie and though the comics cut into it, its still here on this dvd . .<br /><br />a surreal, maybe unrealistic in some ways escapade into escapism, but sometimes that makes for some great entertainment..<br /><br />its ART, man!! ~ile, oh man what i wouldnt do to be in the remake of the Warriors.. <br />well thats all i have to say i guess, it is a great movie and though the comics cut into it, its still here on this dvd . . <br />a surreal, maybe unrealistic in some ways escapade into escapism, but sometimes that makes for some great entertainment.. <br />its ART, man!! ~ <br />
B0002IVN9W|3.0|Before I heard this album I thought there were only going to be a couple of good songs. But instead I liked all of them I was truly amazed. <br /> <br />Great work from The Arcade Fire this is my first album from them but I do not know why you guys give this 5 stars, yes all songs are great and I can listen to this album everyday and not get bored but this isn't a classic think about it they in 10 years will this still be played. <br /> <br />And yes right now these songs are great but it doesn't help the genre and it doesn't surpass other albums. <br /> <br />Verdict: 3.9 out of 5.0 Definitely a buy!! Buy it, love it!!
0060930187|4.0|Sylvia Plath was one of the most gifted young poets of her generation. ARIEL, by far her finest work, was completed just days before she committed suicide in 1963 at the age of thirty.<br /><br />More widely read is her novel THE BELL JAR, written between 1958 and 1962, and published only six weeks before her death. Less a novel than a thinly fictionalized memoir of her first suicide attempt at age twenty, THE BELL JAR has become a feminist manifesto supposedly chronicling the frustrated hopes of a young woman held a virtual prisoner by an uncaring society.<br /><br />Plath's posthumous adoption by the feminist movement largely obscured the fineness of her writing and the truth about her life. As her daughter, Frieda Rebecca Hughes has acidly observed, Plath became a \\"suicide doll\\" for an intellectual movement seeking real-life martyrs. This turn of circumstance has long frustrated readers and critics who wish to assess Plath on her own terms.<br /><br />It is clear from a close reading of THE BELL JAR that Sylvia Plath was a complex, brilliant, unbalanced, creative and ultimately self-destructive person. On the one hand it is tragic that Plath ended her life before antidepressant drug therapies came into use, possibly regulating her lifelong history of extreme mood swings; on the other, medications may have subdued the brilliance and passion that underlie this book and the ARIEL poems.<br /><br />As THE BELL JAR begins we find young \\"Esther Greenwood\\" spending a summer in New York City as a student \\"guest editor\\" at a major women's magazine.<br /><br />Plath spares no effort in underlining the fact that this experience, with its exposure to the broad but not always genteel cultural and social mileu that is New York City horrifies Esther, an overprotected suburban girl to the tips of her well-shined saddle shoes. What another girl might find exotic or exciting about New York, Esther finds utterly repugnant.<br /><br />Her innocence leads her into several unpleasant encounters with men, and several scathing confrontations with the other girls in her group as well as the editor of the magazine, Jay Cee, whose pointed comments are almost uniformly unkind.<br /><br />Plath admittedly caricatured and lampooned real people throughout THE BELL JAR, cruelly and so much so that she published it under a pseudonym, \\"Victoria Lucas\\" in Britain, and felt that it should never be published in the United States. Her mother, with whom she had a symbiotic and mutually supportive relationship, appears in THE BELL JAR as a thick-headed ogre, largely blind to Esther's travails.<br /><br />Esther herself is a supremely gifted but supremely self-involved person whose constant internal dialogue effectively blots out much of the world around her. She is far less sensitive to the wants and needs of others than to her own feelings, of which even the most transitory or irrational are paramount. If Plath's Esther is a caricature, then she was the most cruel of all to herself. If Esther is an honest portrait, then Plath presents herself as a temperamental overachiever and a person who neither liked others nor was particularly likeable, at least at age twenty.<br /><br />Esther is like many depressed young people. She is unable to see any way out of her immediate unhappiness other than killing herself. Her contemplation of self-destruction, the actual attempt, and her long, slow painful recovery are recounted in searingly sad detail. The writing is simple but poignant.<br /><br />Throughout the book Sylvia Plath/Esther Greenwood laments that she is heremetically sealed within a bell jar, unable to have meaningful contact with life. Esther freely admits her terror of choices. To choose one path is to allow all the roads not taken to darken forever.<br /><br />These are thoughts that pass through every young mind, but they have rarely been committed to paper so well. GIRL, INTERRUPTED by Susanna Kaysen (which very coincidentally takes place in roughly the same era and in the same private psychiatric hospital) is but a pale shadow of THE BELL JAR.<br /><br />Dredging all this pain and reexamining this time in her life may not have been the best personal choice for Sylvia Plath, whose bell jar did descend again, and with finality. Plath fell into a deep depression during the writing of THE BELL JAR. Her personal life collapsed. She became increasingly isolated from those around her, even while she wrote the poems of ARIEL in a white heat, sometimes at the rate of two a day. She finally succeeded in taking her own life on February 11, 1963.BELL JAR.

0060723513|2.0|Being interested in things Australian, I welcomed the offer to borrow this book from a coworker who also enjoys reading books about Australia.  She had told me this was a true story.  It disturbed me somewhat by the end of it, so I'm glad to hear it was fiction. <br /> <br />It reads very well.  It's a quick read. And that's the positive. <br /> <br />It also presented the Aboriginal practices in such a way that is fascinating.  Being that I know very little about the Aboriginal culture, I cannot comment as to whether this is fact or not, but I'm willing to believe the people on here who say it isn't. <br /> <br />Why? <br /> <br />Because parts of the book were either unbelievable or disappointing. <br /> <br />I haven't read this in a while, but wasn't she teaching a course on Aboriginal culture before she was \\"invited\\" to join them?  Didn't she have a clue that she might end up somewhere where high heels and a dress wouldn't be appropriate? <br /> <br />The ending of the book really bothered me.  Here was a woman who spent weeks with these people and supposedly became one with them.  She explicitly says many times how much the Aboriginals tolerate the civilized people no matter what (whether this is true or not is besides the point - she says it over and over), but yet....  But yet, when she returns to civilization, rather than take the open mindedness that the Aboriginals seemed to have ingraned in her (which she needed in order to accept many of the rituals and practices they had asked her to partake in), she becomes rudly intolerant for the \\"civilized\\" culture for not believing what had happened to her.  She goes as far as to call them narrow minded for not even accepting what had happened to her, and in the end she moves out of Australia and back to the US out of frustration. <br /> <br />This bothered me.  This reminds me of Michael Crighton's autobiographical book about his own spiritual journeys.  Every chapter would start with him being impatient and intolerant of his environment (whatever it would be).  Then by the end of the chapter he would become more tolerant.  By the end of the chapter the reader would have seen how much he had learned and grown from that experience.  But then the next chapter would begin and he'd be back to his unsympathetic ways. <br /> <br />This is what I saw here.  This woman had been around a patient, serene culture that took no urgency to teach her that there's more to life.  Instead of taking that patience and that tolerance back to her own world, she was nasty and negative and frustrated.  Whether this book is true or not, is not the point at this stage.  As a human being this \\"character\\" learned nothing but to be arrogant about her own experience, instead of accepting of the fact that no everyone is going to believe her account.
B000BTJDGC|5.0|The Exorcism of Emily Rose was, in my opinion (and I've researched many exorcism cases for my horror novels) one of the most accurate portrayals of  what an actual possession case would look like.    The movie is exactly what the writers and producers held it out to be. It focuses on the trial of the priest who presided over the exorcism, not the exorcism itself.    Although the possession and the exorcism are shown in flashback, the focus is more on the court case following it, which I thought was an outstanding idea.    For those of you, and there were many in the theater, who want the high make-up special effect-laiden horror you won't find it here.     For those of you who want a movie that  does what all good movies do, provoke a discussion that lasts long after the movie is over, here you have it.    The movie, in the court room, does a fantastic job of explaining what happened to the girl both from the religious and the non-religious point of view.     To compare this to The Exorcist would be an injustice. This is a movie that, in its own right, deserves to stand as one of the better made horror films in recent history.
B000001EAQ|4.0|Constantly overlooked as just frivolous experimentation, however the tracks are strong in their own right, and come together as a surprisingly complete package. This is not a marginal album; it's a highlight and milestone for U2. It's not their most polished production but ambitious and essential just the same. A stretch for a band many would prefer to corner into a certain genre.

I also love Natalie Portman's role in this film, very enigmatic yet \\"disarming.\\" While this won't be the best film you've ever watched, I still recommend it for its unique contributions it may give to your outlook.
B00005U122|4.0|Surprisingly fresh and entertaining. Roger does great homage to his classic Floyd hits, as does his very talented assemblage of musicians. From start to finish he is energized and looks like a man far younger than his years. I expected much less, due to his Live in Berlin disaster, and especially because of the absence of David Gilmour. Any modern Floyd or Waters reproduction of the classics seem to be firing at 1/2 brilliance. (It's a tradeoff, no Waters or no Gilmour, what a terrible shame). Gilmour isn't missed as much as usual during the In The Flesh performance, however, which is a huge compliment to everyone involved. The New songs are equal to the classics because Roger is so fired to perform on all cylinders, thus garnering a 4 star rating. The backup singers as usual add that extra dimension and wonderment to the proceedings.
0060926317|3.0|As I read this book, I was continually compelled to question the reality that this women actually experienced the events she describes in Mutant Message Down Under (just look at her picture for one thing). I would recommend the story as being entertaining, but I think she is doing the people of Australia a disservice by calling it anything but fiction, and not very well-written fiction at that.
B000002BFL|4.0|Every self styled music critic has a at least a few \\"black sheep\\" albums they hold in special esteem. As frustrating as it is that they don't receive the public and critical acclaim deserved, there is something in our selfish nature that takes pride in being among a small group of enlightened admirers. \\"The Ghost of Tom Joad\\" is one of mine. Gloriously unnoticed and largely forgotten amidst the colossus of the Springsteen catalogue, I'm hard pressed to think of any other album I'd rather hear in a reflective/ melancholy,  idle mid-week evening, sort of mood.<br /><br />The album title of course presupposes a lot in it's reference to Steinbeck's \\"The Grapes of Wrath\\". As such it could easily be expected to fall into the realm of unforgivably overblown, self importance and frivolity. Likely a lesser musician would have been mired with such a facetious approach, and produce a laughably forgettable outcome. Fortunately Bruce's integrity and conviction prevent any atrophy of craftsmanship, and the album does proud the social legacy of G.O.W<br /><br />The songs contain unforgettable characters and stories with workman like artistry. Fitted with subtle guitar arrangements and occasional harmonic explosions, the music never detracts from the lyrics, which are the driving agent here. Much like Nebraska (another introspective folky piece a decade previous) Tom Joad shines with a slow burning, hard earned beauty which invites repeated exposure. The difference is breadth of perspective, which runs from introverted analysis to a larger social commentary, and thus establishes a more timeless appeal than does Nebraska. Also the musicianship is on a higher level here.<br /><br />Standouts include Highway 29, a stunning mood piece of a song, with such a wistfully tremendous finish-\\"I told myself it was all something in her, but as we drove I knew it was something in me\\" and \\"I closed my eyes and I was running, yeah I was running, then I was flyin\\". The Line, an exploration of poverty and destitution, could elicit emotion from a rock -\\"They risk death in the deserts and mountains, we send 'em home and they come right back again, Carl hunger is a powerful thing.\\"<br /><br />Straight Time, Youngstown, Sinaloa Cowboys, and the Title track are also all absolute stand outs. The Springsteenesque themes of social repression, political indifference, human resilience, and a general consensus of `history to the defeated' are explored with brilliant panache here.<br /><br />In a fall 05 interview with Rolling Stone, Bono pride fully stated \\"If Dylan is Faulkner, then Springsteen is Steinbeck\\". Opinions aside, that statement seems relevant to this review.<br /><br />And for what it's worth; I agree.stitution, could elicit emotion from a rock -\\"They risk death in the deserts and mountains, we send 'em home and they come right back again, Carl hunger is a powerful thing.\\"  <br />Straight Time, Youngstown, Sinaloa Cowboys, and the Title track are also all absolute stand outs.

B000089RVX|4.0|Thsi is the kind if music that really gets me going. It's like a rocked up version of some of that old folk music that lots of people like (including me.) This CD is great for putting on and driving around on a Friday night!
B000002J09|5.0|Everest of the Zepplin catalogue. Bonham is the quarterback and unheralded force of the albums crushing sounds especially on 'When the levy breaks'. Spiritual, invigorating, sublime, and wonderful. If IV is the measuring stick for all subsequent 5 star albums, there just wouldn't be any.
B000002NHN|5.0|The music on this CD is so awesome! It's like a journey to a distant land. Kind of reminds me of \\"Witching Hour\\" and some other songs by that band Outgrabe. \\"Marco Polo\\" is probably my favorite, but really this album blends together into a single whole. Just put it on and you're gone for 45 minutes. I like that.
B0000TB050|5.0|Remarkable atmosphere and emotion. Bono's a rare breed that can make a performance in front of 80,000 people personal, intimate, and polished. This is  'A sort of homecoming' for U2, after the death of Bob Hughson (Bono's Dad) and really packs a punch. The band is terrific, and Bono is as animated and charged as ever. Kite, Out of control, One, and Walk On are especially fabulous. This performance is my favorite U2, and a real gem.
B000BM6AVA|1.0|I Never liked this band nor any nu metal bulls*it that has came out, this album is just dreadful, stupid, idiotic mess, their first album was good, but that's about it, I Hated everything else, to compare this group to RATM is just stupid, this band is just stupid, Lousy and lameo. <br /> <br />This is why I Hate the music industry these days. <br />

B00005JO1Y|5.0|My initial reaction to \\"King Kong\\" was that it was not as good as I thought it would be, but that might be because the film is 187 minutes long and even though I did not get anything to drink I was rather jumpy the last hour or so.  But then during the mostly silent final scenes when beauty and the beast are reunited I was totally absorbed.  Still, this is a movie that demands the consumption of large amounts of hot buttered popcorn and liquid refreshments and although they have a perfect place for an intermission when we skip from Skull Island back to Manhattan, we do not get a break.  Fortunately \\"EW\\" gives us several places to make a break for it that I feel I should pass along.  If you are squeamish, then bug out 114 minutes in to film when the horde of insects descends (you have 4 minutes).  If you would rather miss the schmaltz then wait until 139 minutes in while Driscoll watches his play (you have 2 minutes).<br /><br />Okay, the 1933 version of \\"King Kong\\" is a certifiable classic and director Peter Jackson gets to do a remake because after \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" trilogy he has carte blanche for the foreseeable future (compare with whatever happened to James Cameron).  Everybody knows the basic story and obviously the computer generated effects that Jackson has at his disposal are a marked improvement over the stop motion animation of Willis H. O'Brien.  The question is whether the story will be as touching, and that is going to depend more of how Jackson tells the story and how Naomi Watts responds to the Kong that she has to imagine in her mind's eye.<br /><br />The big difference is that this time Ann Darrow cares for the big ape, which changes the dynamic for both her rescue on Skull Island and how she and Kong end up together on top of the Empire State Building.  Beauty still kills the beast in this one, but she also tries to save him.  The final test for this film is quite simple: are there tears in your eyes at the end?  There are other changes as well, the most notable of which is that Jack Black's Carl Denham is more opportunist than adventurer.  Robert Armstrong's character was a producer of his time who sees Kong as just another animal to bring back alive, but Black's character is clearly intended to be judged by our contemporary standards and he really deserves the fate of the Charles Grodin character who was the architect of the trip to Skull Island in the 1976 remake.  Kong might not be the hero of the film, but Denham is clearly the villain and the fact he does not know he is in that role does not forgive his actions.<br /><br />As for the hero in the film, that would be Adrian Brody's Jack Driscoll, who is now a Broadway playwright shanghaied to write the script for Denham's movie.  To put being a hero in context there is also Kyle Chandler's Bruce Baxter, the movie star who is not used to having to play the hero in real life.  But being the hero here means rescuing the damsel in distress only once, and since she did not want to be rescued being saved is not as endearing as it would be.  The script by Fran Walsh, Philippa Boyens, and Jackson follows up on this by having Denham, Jack and Ann be where they are on the night the 8th Wonder of the World is introduced to a sold out theater.<br /><br />Overall this film sticks to the original screenplay in terms of the narrative action and throws in more dinosaurs, bugs, cars and any other image that a computer can generate.  The only omission that I thought was of consequence was that because Denham is looking for Skull Island rather than what he believes is there this time around, we lose the scene where he directs Ann and gets her to screen at the sight of something too horrible to see.  In the original film that was not only an example of foreshadowing but Fay Wray's scream at that point is important because it is pretty good, but it is nothing compared to what she lets loose when she sees Kong for the first time.  Watts' big scream is pretty good, but it was the elevation in terror that made Wray as important to the original as the special effects with Kong.  Jackson shot the scene, but it was one of several scenes cut.<br /><br />Jackson has included some nice homages to the original in his film.  Fay Wray and Merriam C. Cooper are mentioned by name as Denham tries to find an actress, Watts wears a cloche hat like Wray did in the early restaurant scene, and the costumes of the natives in the original are reprised in Denham's Broadway show along with Max Steiner's original score, which is a telling critique of the 1933's film inherent racism.  You will also see echoes of other films from \\"Bambi\\" to \\"Jurassic Park.\\"  Rick Baker, the master of make up who played Kong in that ape suit in the 1976 version, is one of the pilots, Jackson is a tail gunner, and if you check out the end credits you will find some other familiar names, even if you do not recognize the faces.  Jackson wanted Fay Wray to be in the film and to deliver the famous final line.  That would certainly have been a lot more than a mere homage and would have qualified as one of the great movie cameos of all time.ty good, but it was the elevation in terror that made Wray as important to the original as the special effects with Kong.

B000060OFT|1.0|...but the best I can come up with is that everyday jargon: stupid. <br /> <br />From the cover, I was expecting a setting somewhere in Europe and during the Middle Ages or so. But the cover was misleading. <br /> <br />I did not like the movie since the beginning. The whole mafia/gangster scene reminded me of a typical Monty Python humor--stupid--but I thought it would get better in time. It didn't. The first scene was a stupid scene, as was the rest of the movie. If the director did it on purpose in an attempt to mock... something... I guess I'm just losing my sense of humor because I did not laugh (at least not *with* him). <br /> <br />Claire Danes looked sweet and innocent at first, but for some reason or other she ticked me off the wrong way. Maybe it was the way she grinned. Maybe it was the way her character could not even afford a bra in spite of her wealth. (Incidentally, wasn't Claire Danes 17 or so during the making of the movie? Was it legal for her to take off her clothes in front of the camera? Wouldn't that be child pornography?) <br /> <br />Finally, while I'm never going to be a qualified judge of art of any form, I'm pretty sure the way Leonardo DiCaprio recited his lined would be just the way I would--which is to say, badly and without any emotion. <br /> <br />So yeah, I guess I've gone off-tangents and failed to support my thesis that the movie is stupid. But seriously, you'll agree it is stupid once you see it. That is, unless you have a thing for either Leo or Claire or both.
0440241588|1.0|<br /> Or even a 'negative star' rating. <br /> <br /> I've never written a review of a book on Amazon, positive or negative, but after having suffered through 100+ pages of repetetive descriptions of ordering food in restaurants in Italian, I decided I had to.... if only to hopefully save someone else the time spent reading this pile of tripe. <br /> <br /> There is no intrigue, there is no plot, there is no humor.... I'm still not really sure what the book was really supposed to be about, other than a vehicle to show off Mr Grisham's rudimentary knowledge of Italian. <br /> <br /> I've also never burned a book before, but it's cold outside and I'm determined to get some benefit from the thing.  <br /> <br /> Where's my matches......
6305841861|5.0|Proof that sequels can be better than the original, this wild, hysterically funny, gory rollercoaster of a movie recaps the first (give or take a few characters) with Ash (Bruce Campbell) and his girlfriend Linda (Denise Bixler) heading to a mountain cabin in the woods and finding more than they bargained for. Ash plays a tape recorder that has chantings from a Professor Knowby which raise spirits that possess Linda. One decapitation later, she's six feet under, and it's up to Ash to kick demon booty, as Knowby's daughter Annie (Sarah Berry) shows up with boyfriend Ed (Richard Domeier) and two hillbilly locals named Jake & Bobbie Joe (Dan Hicks & Kassie Wesley). Oh yeah, and Ash's right hand decides to turn bad, so he 'lops it off at the wrist' and slams a chainsaw down onto it for a showdown with Henrietta (director Sam Raimi's little brother Ted, in a brilliant casting idea), Knowby's demon wife living in the wine cellar.<br /> This truly is a revolutionary movie, one of the first and most memorable to balance comedy and gore-splattering humor successfully (like Shaun of the Dead, Dead & Breakfast, the Scream trilogy, Idle Hands, etc., just to name a few). Campbell became a B-movie king with the Evil Dead trilogy (the third sequel is Army of Darkness), and rightfully so, as he takes all the insane goings-on with a straight face and clever wisecracks (many ripped off by the likes of Duke Nukem). Raimi truly is an amazing director (he went on to make the great Spider-Man movies and is releasing #3), using Three Stooges-like gags in between the flying limbs and splashing gore.<br /> If you like horror movies at all, the Evil Dead movies are one of the best (or THE best) to have, spawning three games (Hail to the King, Fistful of Boomstick, and Regeneration) so far, making a career for Bruce (don't call him Ash) Campbell and Raimi, and pretty much reinventing the horror genre with tongue-in-bloody-cheek action. And that, my friends, is as groovy as it gets.
1581650701|5.0|This book kept me on my feet and last breath.. read it over and over... sure over 20 times and still want to read it again.. I had a copy but when I left University I gave it to a friend as a token of luck.... It's a book I never stopped reading except daytime.. but the images in the the book stayed with me all day and could not wait for night to come... the only way I found connection with it was reading it at night... every detail became very alive infront of my eyes.. I felt like and still feel like I belonged in that world... I have read many books but this one  is one of the masterpieces that captured my heart...it became part of me.. the plot is brilliantly set out and the unfolding of events kept on moving.. there was no moment of missing a clue.. the mystery, the thriller,  the suspense, the relationship of characters just became a real world that we all live in.... it was as if, if I had to walk out of that door, then I will be engulfed in that world... this has been a fiery discovery of Mr. Dean Koontz's works. I have recommended the book to both my life partner and friends.... read it.. you will never be disappointed.... it's great!!!! <br /> <br />Tebby W.T. Ramasike, (South Africa). xxx
B000268QB2|4.0|The British pop sensation Keane is making huge waves across the pond here in America. They have a style all their own, and it's a breath of fresh air. They have no guitar player and i can't relee even tell because the lyrics and rythums and music is so powerful to the ears. They have something that not everyone can compete with and many other stars from across the sea aren't doing as well as they are because of that factor. <br /> <br />Their cd, Hopes and Fears, was so good that i bought it based on the assumbtion that they would be something i would like, and i got way more than i asked for! Their style of music is exactly the type where everyone can enjoy and sing/dance along to. <br /> <br />Keane is  haveing great success and will be able to follow up greatly with something a lot more musical if at all possoble. To know they've already recived international success makes it a lot easier to create something that they've already had the intire time deep down in their souls, and that is where their sound comes from!
0156027321|2.0|I heard great things about this novel, but I found it boring.<br /><br />The first 100 pages are set-up about Pi's life before the shipwreck.  These are interesting and unique, a boy so in love with God that he joins 3 religions.  But ultimately, this has little to do with the real story of the shipwreck.<br /><br />The next 200 pages are a boy stuck on a small boat with a tiger.  Interesting concept, but nothing happens.  It's about a 100 pages too long. I ended up skimming over most of it without missing anything.<br /><br />Martel should have cut out about half of the boat travels and interspersed the intro materials with the shipwrecked period as flashbacks to break up the monotony of the middle of the book, and tied his love of multiple religions better into the rest of the story.
0060977493|5.0|My first exposure to Arundhati Roy was as a guest speaker of the Lannon Foundation when I was a student in Santa Fe. From her first sentence I was mesmerized. In Come September, the speech that Roy gave for the Lannon Foundation in Santa Fe, she yields strong language and pointed statements, but with a voice as full of compassion as it is fervor. The same spirit that joins concern and vehemence in Arundhati Roy's political discourse carries into her fiction. Roy says \\"fiction dances out of me. Non-fiction is wrenched out by the aching, broken world I wake up to every morning.\\"<br /><br />In The God of Small Things, Arundhati Roy has a careful grasp of language that creates prose unmatched by any other I have ever read. The place descriptions carefully construct the home at Ayemenem. The characters, particularly Estha, Rahel, and Ammu come alive as the story unfolds. Their actions, while sometimes deplorable, are also unmistakably human. The events in the book are both profoundly disturbing and beautiful.<br /><br />The language in The God of Small Things is reflective of the thoughts Rahel as a young girl. From the day dreamy funeral of Sophie Mol to Rahel's separation from Estha and Ammu, each event is carefully plucked from the discerning eyes of an adolescent. The events of the story are meticulously woven to be consistent with a remembrance as Rahel returns after many years of being away from her home and family.<br /><br />In The God of Small Things Arundhati Roy renders a story both proverbial and absolutely unforgettable. The God of Small Things is among only a handful of books in which I felt a terrible loss when I left the characters on the last page. I think that I somehow hoped that the last page would never come. I know that this is a story that I will read and cherish many times throughout my life.
055357342X|5.0|This third installment in the Song of Ice and Fire series does not disappoint. In fact, it exceeds most expectations. Before I begin my review, I will start by saying that this is my favorite fantasy series and I believe it is a must read for fans of the fantasy genre. <br /> <br />A Storm of Swords picks up where A Clash of Kings left off, adding new point of views and expanding on ones from the earlier books. There is tragedy here as well as triumph. This book is not for the light of art, and Martin's form of dark fantasy is not recommended for immature audiences. This book is full of warfare, death, and sexual references, and I love it! <br /> <br />If you are familiar with the series, you know that the Seven Kingdoms have been fragmented with different factions fighting over the Iron Throne in order to rule the land. In this book, Martin once again does not balk at killing off main characters and storylines, and the amount of death of some of the principal characters in this book is almost mind-boggling. It is refreshing to see an author do this, however, after suffering through so many books that lose a lot of their intrigue because no one dies except the bad guys. <br /> <br />That is another reason A Storm of Swords and this series as a whole is a success. While there are some truly black and white characters, many of them are gray, meaning they have good and evil tendencies. I find myself rooting for the supposed \\"bad guys,\\" such as Jaime Lannister who gains a point of view in this book (one of my favorite PoV's actually). <br /> <br />If you're in the mood for a gripping story that will keep you reading from start to finish, pick up A Storm of Swords and be ready to have a great time reading a great book.
B000AL730O|5.0|Sixty-three-year-old Sir Paul McCartney gives us another of his most wonderful masterpieces. A FINE LINE really rocks hard! There's also some nice subtle pieces like JENNY WREN and ENGLISH TEA. McCartney gave an outstanding performance of some of his solo songs and Beatles songs at this year's Super Bowl game. One track on this CD sounds like YOUNG BOY from 1997's FLAMING PIE. All the other songs are awesome.
B000BOH8XW|1.0|People find it easy and love to put the blame on God when it comes to the problems in this world, and Shakira is one of these people. She says it clear in \\"How Do You Do.\\" What she and so many people do not understand is that God is not the one to blame for wars and conflicts. We all have the right of free will to choose whatever life we want to live. A lot of us have chosen darker paths, and that is what has gotten us to this point in our human history, with wars and famine and other problems. I'm so shocked to see how Shakira has changed since \\"Octavio Dia\\" (from her last Spanish CD, Donde Estan Los Ladrones), in which she previously lamented the way WE humans have caused so much destruction, and God is the victim. Either she has had an unfortunate change of heart since then, or sadly, she's just using popular opinion that she might not agree with, in order to sell records and make money. Judging by the cover of the album, she appears to have turned into a rebel who questions her own original faith. And yet, she herself promotes peace and love and \\"no fighting\\" (from her new hit single, \\"Hips Don't Lie.\\") What baffles me is that she does this and tries to spread peace, telling people not to fight, while at the same time blaming God for wars. But we are the ones causing these wars. <br />As for the music of her album, there is more rock-oriented tunes than Laundry Service or Fijacion Oral Volumen 1. But sometimes it's still hard to try and understand some of the words she sings without reading the lyrics. \\"Dreams for Plans\\" is an example. Oral Fixation is not a bubble-gum teen pop CD at all. In fact, some of the themes in the songs are more mature in nature. Two of the tracks are common among Fijacion Oral 1 and Oral Fixation 2, which is weird because she claims to have written 60 songs, 30 in each language. With such a wealthy list of songs, you would think that the two albums would be completely unique. <br />I think she could have done a better job. Fijacion Oral 1 is definately the better of the two CDs. Shakira should stick more to singing in Spanish because it's her mother tongue and she can express herself much better in that language. In fact, all of her Spanish songs are better than her English ones. She shined in her Donde Estan Los Ladrones era. Oral Fixation 2 is okay, but not her best work.

B00005JO1Y|3.0|I attended the movie on 12/17/2005. Peter Jackson's treatment of \\"King Kong\\" deserves kudos.  The special effects were top rate, along with the dialog, cinematography and good acting, and it's action scenes!<br /><br />Even though I've seen the original, this movie also deserves credit for it's take on a familiar theme!  Check it out if you get a chance!  I give this movie three stars!

044651652X|1.0|This book, which had an amazing crest of popular success when it was introduced, is a quick sketch of a careworn farm woman who chooses to enliven her ordinary backcountry life when a good looking photographer in tight jeans comes to call.<br /><br />He is already on the prowl--with the cover of photographing covered bridges.  She is stuck down on the farm in a life that is predictable.  It is a kind of midlife crisis for both of the main characters.  What will this chance encounter do to them?  Will they abandon their past for a tantalizing but uncertain future?  Or will this be just a fleeting affair?<br /><br />It is all very low quality soap opera.  Surely the plot is as old as Methuselah, and the decisions made are easy enough to guess from the get-go.  The truly sad thing about this novel is that it became almost a \\"go ahead and try it\\" message for all those who thought they could relieve their middle-aged boredom by a fling in a clandestine bedroom.<br /><br />The idea that excitement can be found in the arms of a handsome wandering stranger is appealing to those who are eager to fantasize their way out of humdrum lives, but even so, the way this book is written (both style and narrative) is so simplistic that it cannot be considered skillful literature.<br /><br />Thus the title of this review.  \\"An Over-Consumed Bit of Fluff!\\"<br /><br />There are so many bona fide romance novels that cover the same ground with more verve and dash, better twists of plot and characterizations.  There are more serious novels that cover the same ground with greater edginess and depth, not to mention a greater grip on the realities of the consequences of, dare we use the word in our time, adultery.<br /><br />It is hard to resist saying that this book plays on the prurient fantasies of an adolescent mind (no matter what the chronological age).
B00008PX8P|5.0|This has to be the best live footage of any band around. It ranges from the beginning of the Led Zeppelin band, all the way into the last of their days as a band. All of these performances are superb, each band member playing to their fullest extent.Earl's Court was the highlight of the DVD, including In My Time of Dying and Trampled Underfoot. This is proof of why Led Zeppelin is the best of the best.
B000BW7QWW|5.0|I love this movie!  It is a wonderful treat for those of us who watched Firefly.  But the great thing is that you don't have to have seen Firefly to enjoy Serenity.  I highly recommend that you watch this movie.  The only complaint I have is that they had to limit the amount of time each character had on screen (which I understand, because it is a movie now...but I wanted to see more of the supporting characters)!  Anyway, 5 stars.
0553801503|4.0|In general, I agree with those people that say \\"yes, it's not the best, but this is still Martin, so stop bitching, it will get better\\". From myself, I would like to add that as far as general American fantasy goes, this is still pretty good. As far as Martin goes, this is C+. This is not because the style of writing has deteriorated. On the contrary!    This is because the last book has mostly diplomacy and almost no serious action. In previous books, readers found \\"cooler\\" and \\"duller\\" chapters. For me, the latter kind was the chapters when characters did not do much but just schemed. This is pretty much the fourth book for you. Cersei, Littlefinger, Martel, guys from the Iron Islands scheming. The real \\"action\\" (not in the movie sense, but in \\"actual events happening\\" sense) happens in the chapters with Sam and Brienna (a little with Jaime and Arya, but not enough). As the previous reviewer noted, this is understandable, because all the arrows have been released, and the bow string needs time to draw. Figures are moving to their positions on the board.    The only exception is the last chapters with Brienna and Cersei. The meeting of Brienna with you-know-whom could've been more interesting. On the other hand, the last chapter with Cersei was definitely the good old Martin! The last chapter with Sam was also nice.    What does this all mean? It means you will have to \\"struggle\\" through scheming of the fourth book. It also means that the fifth book will have all the \\"cool\\" chapters concentrated in one book (which Martin will have more time to work on). (Those of you who find Daenerhys dull, think about this: where is Tyrion going? And, now that we've read this book: where are the Sage and Victarion going?)    Also, unless I am mistaken, the fifth book will have events happening in parallel with the fourth book. Which means that the *sixth* book will also be cool, as all the scheming of A Feast for Crows will result in some serious \\"action\\".    Lastly, whatever theresults, I believe Martin's decision was ultimately the right one. Events in the South have come to a temporary conclusion (we all have a general idea of what's about to happen and will not be sitting at the edge for the next year). Now the events on the Wall and in the East can be addressed fully. Otherwise, you would really have a book cut in half, with no (temporary) logical conclusion, and with chapters not really relating to each other.
B00005JO1Y|5.0|I am not a fan of remakes of classic movies.  If it was done right the first time, let it alone.  The original King Kong is a classic of imagination that captured this 9 year old boy as much as it did Peter Jackson at that age.  Then, of course, one grows up and realizes that the 1930's movie is a prisoner of its time, locked into perceptions about primitive cultures, savagery, race, and the nature of the beast itself.  And we forgive its flaws because it is a ripping good yarn and,whether intentional or not,the great heart of the story is sadness at the beast's destruction.  Even when deleted footage was restored showing a Kong not quite as loveable as the orginal theatrical version (what with him crushing natives like cigarette butts, dropping brunettes dozens of stories, biting heads etc.) the indelible ending of the film is Kong's sacrifice and his devotion to Ann to his very death.  It was probably the first time a movie elicited tears of pity from 9 year old eyes.<br /><br />Peter Jackson in his love for that film has wisely not so much  re-made Kong as he has re-imagined that film.  It was an absolutely correct decision to keep King Kong in its original time of the 1930's, allowing Jackson to retain and expand the look of the original while deftly altering some of the original's quainter notions.  Jackson has kept the heart of the original, while having fun parodying some of its outdated concepts, especially with the stage show surrounding Kong's Broadway debut.  Keeping it in the 30's somehow also retains the<br /><br />sense of plausible wonder.<br /><br />Likewise, the decision to make this King Kong resemble exactly a real silverback gorilla was spot on. In the years since King Kong we have come to know that gorillas, while hugely powerful animals are rather shy and gentle vegetarians if not threatened. We have seen Koko ostensibly signing to her keepers and petting her kitten. It was overdue to correct the perception of the wild ape. Jackson had to choose between the \\"monster on the loose\\" aspect or a more subtle view of the beast, and I believe his choice was correct.<br /><br />This Kong is fearsome, but with threats removed, he is a sad and gentle creature.  Showing the many bones of dead Kong-sized gorillas strewn about his lair, quietly informs us that he is probably the last of his kind, surviving alone in a very hostile world.  His visage is scarred and weary.  It is another brilliant stroke that helps explain the relationship that develops between Ann and Kong.<br /><br />And speaking of Ann, Naomi Watts is.....lovely.  Stunningly, heart-breakingly lovely.  My father was infatuated with Fay Wray, something I fully understood when I saw the original Kong on the big screen.  Fay was gorgeous too, but not much was asked of her beyond screaming a lot.  Jackson has corrected what many of us alway wanted from the original, one moment of recognition from Fay Wray's Ann that Kong has saved her life several times, and would and will die for her. Jackson builds that recognition in Naomi Watt's Ann to a relationship of trust and care that is touching and moving.  The scene of them sliding on the ice in Central Park is beautiful and and absolutely inspired.<br /><br />The other changes in the film are fine by me.  The movie takes its time in the early going, laying a foundation of the 1930's Depression Jackson probably thought necessary to explain to a modern audience (and not needed for the original audience experiencing it when they left the theatre) and expanding characters and the setting aboard the ship.  Patience was rewarded because once they hit Skull island it was hellzapopin from there on out.<br /><br />The movie is spectacular to look at, from the brilliantly conceived Skull Island, to Kong's mountaintop lair, to nighttime 1930's New York, to the aforementioned Central Park scene, and finally to the faithfully re-imagined stand on top of the Empire State Building in a gorgeously dawning New York.  A wonderful homage to the original, all the while retaining its own brilliance and integrity, this is a fine film, and Peter Jackson can be proud that he has paid tribute to the original all the while bringing to it his own heart and vision. Well worthwhile.
B000BYY0RY|5.0|I just recieved my copy of Kylie's Showgirl dvd from Canada (as it is currently unavailable in the U.S.) and I must say, I was VERY impressed. The picture quality, the sound quality, it's all brilliant. I was very surprised to see that the dvd also features a 5.1 DTS soundtrack! The song selection was chosen to perfectly retrospect her entire career. I would have liked to have seen \\"Got To Be Certain\\" performed, it's one of my all time favorite Kylie Tracks. The majority of the songs are very energetic and upbeat. Her older songs are remixed and modernized to fit with the rest of the show. \\"Hand On Your Heart\\" gets a Classic House remix while Spinning Around is remixed to CeCe Pennistons 7\\" Choice remix of \\"Finally\\". It works perfectly and sounds awesome. Kylie's voice is impeccable. She hits all the high notes with prefect grace and no strain at all. She perfoms the whole show effortlessly. you would never think that she was ill or feeling the beginning effects of the cancer at all. \\"Put Yourself In My Place\\", my favorite Kylie ballad, is performed as it's original version, unlike in her other concerts where she tones it down and sings it acoustically, it sounds immaculate, all the high notes, again, perfect. All of the costumes, dancers, lighting, bakground projection screens, they are all alive with brilliant colors. The dancers, male AND female, are some of the hottest I have ever seen. A very special version of \\"I Should Be So Lucky\\" is performed in it's original version with Kylie and her dancers also performing the lyrics is sign language while singing. Very, Very cool. Altogether this show is a feast for the eyes and ears. An audio cd version of this show would be perfect for road trips! I would LOVE to be able to see her live but thats kinda far fetched for me being in Oklahoma! Who knows, I hear she is still planning the Austrailian leg of the tour with a few modifications once she gets the all clear from her doctors. Maybe I will have the chance to fly down to Australia and see it. It's a dream of mine. I got to see Madonna's Re-Invention Tour, so thats one down and one to go!

0060977493|5.0|In this \\"Coming of Age in India (and the world)\\" tale of a girl who has tasted the best and the worst the world has to offer, and then has \\"re-returned\\" home, Arundhati Roy speaks to us in a new universal language, the language of our age.  It is an inventive and unadorned prose; one that with unerring accuracy and in a staccato like fashion, unveils at once the underbelly of what a so-called civilized world can create, become, and then bequeath to its progeny.  At the same time, the book by its sheer honesty, leaves us with a glimmer of hope that the sane (as well as the humble (not the meek)) may yet someday, somehow, inherit the earth.<br /><br />The phrase, \\"the God of Small Things\\" is a rich and universally serviceable metaphor for those times, ideas and situations when the smallness within us is allowed to triumph over the large outside us.  It is a symbolic code for those times when the indecent, like a mutant gene, is miscoded or recoded as its opposite, decency; when the collective insane and absurd wins out over the individually sensible.  It points to our habits of projecting and turning the things we fear most into Sartre's proverbial \\"other,\\" into our personal and mental enemy.  It is that force in our minds that allows us to turn feelings of fear,and shame, and smallness, and the self-loathing that these induce inside us, into a justified basis for violence, self-destruction, oppression and much, much worse.<br /><br /> \\"The God of Small Things\\" is that conceptual vector that winds around all the worthless things that define us and that we thus hold on to as if for dear life; things that lead unerringly back to a weakness at the center of our being.  It refers back to those things and times when the brand of chauvinism we prefer most, our own cultural and family idiosyncrasies, collective prejudices, and orthodoxies, get colonized and rationalized as \\"the new sense of fairness,\\" as the new morality and the new way of life; when the inconsistent, inchoate, and inane, get transported across times and generations and then get transformed into, and then somehow begin to masquerade as, their opposites. It is a metaphor for putting the same old (greatly weakened) wine into newer but ever-smaller bottles.<br /><br />It is \\"the God of small things\\" that turns yesterday's immorality and amorality into \\"today's new morality;\\" the honorable into the dishonorable; the holy into the profane; a lost in the real world into a win in our heads.  It is how Priests can rape little boys (and in the Church), and pimps can pretend to love the women they exploit.  It is how any tyrants can use their (always temporary) power for evil and recall and remember it as good.  And, it is \\"the God of small things\\" that somehow, despite our rebellious higher consciousness, always seems to get encoded in our brains -- or at least as Roy would say, in that black hole of delusions that it creates as a parallel universe within our brains.<br /><br /> \\"The God of Small Things\\" is just one of the many stunningly original and creative (and irreplaceable) ideas that Ms. Roy mines from our unconscious and thrusts into our consciousness in this \\"Tale of Many Cultures\\" telescoped onto her \\"small\\" home town, of Ayemenem India and its environs.<br /><br />Her story is without a doubt one for the ages -- one that leaves us with a mental map for decoding the absurdity that continues to be inflicted upon us, that inflicts us, and which too often IS us.  It is a story about how rules are made, enforced, ignored, reversed, broken and then re-invented.  This iterative process of rule-making is a collective absurdity that we seem to have no defense against, and seem to accept meekly and willingly, an absurdity that, despite our best efforts, continues to govern all cultures in the known universe.<br /><br />It is \\"the God of Small Things\\" that explains anomalies like the persistence of racism, classism, caste systems, sexism, incest, and all illogical political systems -such as Communism in India, or Democracy in Mississippi.  For instance, it is \\"the God of Small Things\\" that is responsible for the fact that characters like the GW Bushes, Tom Delays, Saddam Husseins, and Osama Bin Ladens of the world appear on stage as the key players in the drama that continues to preside over the known \\"civilized\\" universe (or to use Roy's adaptations, the Black hole that they occupy in the history of the so-called known \\"civilized\\" universe).<br /><br />This novel does what all good literature is supposed to do: use language to shake the world out of its comfort zone: Its job is to wake us up to who we really are, rather than who we prefer to be seen as.<br /><br />I do not know that a more original, inventive, honest, or more deeply moving or sober critique of our times exists than \\"The God of Small Things.\\"  The only thing that comes close to it is John Ralston Saul's \\"The Unconscious Civilization.\\"<br /><br />Ten stars.  Amen.

B0002XVQNU|4.0|'Daredevil',`Fantastic Four', and `Spiderman' make a very interesting trio of superhero movies, especially as they are, all three of them, based on a Marvel Comics character. To my mind, they exemplify the three levels of quality of `watchable' superhero movies, as opposed to those that are derivative and lacking any spark of imagination.<br /><br />Although many have rated it fairly well, I would put the newest, `Fantastic Four' at the bottom of the list, along with `Hellboy', which I happened to like, but which shares with `Fantastic Four' some serious difficulties to our suspending disbelief. These movies are simply made for fun. You can almost sense the tongue in cheek attitude of the writer and director, let alone the actors. The situation which creates the superpowers is simply too improbable to accept. How is it that a single physical phenomenon would have five totally different effects on five normal, healthy humans? I know just enough about genetics to know how this may be explained, but the film narrative touches on none of this. We are just meant to swallow this story whole. In contrast, the transformation of Matt Murdock is totally plausible. Enhanced senses following loosing one sense are very real. They just posited a bit more than normal ability in that direction. The genesis of Peter Parker's superpowers is a bit more sci fi, but totally believable, given the chance to believe a genetically enhanced spider species.<br /><br />`Daredevil' is probably the least popular of these three movies, and the first time I watched it, it didn't do much for me. On second watching, especially with the extras on the DVD, I appreciated that the moviemakers really accomplished something here. The premise behind both hero and villains is totally plausible and the director, special effects crew, and actors increase this verisimilitude by using very few CGI effects and stunt doubles. Most of what you see on the screen is really Ben Affleck, Jennifer Garner, and Colin Farrell, enhanced with a few wires to accomplish some of the more adventuresome gymnastics. The filmmakers also enhance the picture by doing a lot of the key scenes at night. This is totally logical, as the sightless Daredevil would have the advantage when his sighted rivals would be almost as visually handicapped as he is. `Daredevil' also has the added value of at least three very human relationships. Along with some of the `Batman' and `Superman' flicks, this holds the penultimate spot in superhero quality films.<br /><br />`Spiderman' is easily on the top tier of superhero movies, based not only on the believability of the premise and the humanity of the actors, but also on the relatively effortless special effects, lightly applied to great effect. I also think the actors contribute much to the quality of this film, where with Toby McGuire, there seems to have been just a bit of casting against type, the way Michael Keaton was cast as Batman in the first Tim Burton `Batman'. While I never read `DareDevil' or `Hellboy' comic books, I am familiar with the original `Fantastic Four' and `Spiderman' comics, so I think the relative merit of the films has a lot to do with the relative merit of the comics, since `Spiderman' is the traditional champion among strong comic book fans. I should add a plug for performances by Michael Chiklis in `Fantastic Four' for his comic relief and by Ben Affleck in `DareDevil' for taking the role so seriously, possibly through the influence of his good buddy, Kevin Smith, who appears in a cameo role as the medical examiner.Farrell, enhanced with a few wires to accomplish some of the more adventuresome gymnastics.

B00005JXY3|5.0|There's a reason why this movie made more at the box office then the first one did and it's because this one got real. Daniel is no longer fighting for a title but for his life in this awesome squeal. This is my favorite out of the entire series cause it gets real and honest and has Daniel fighting for his life as his mentor prepares to fight for his. In this movie Daniel is left to find his own way basically as his mentor has some problems of his own this time around and this makes for a very interesting spin as Daniel suddenly finds that his mentor is not made of stone.

0062502182|3.0|Get bunch of cliche philosophies, put them into a storyline, and you get this book. <br /> <br />    I do praise this writer for being able to put those philosophies into a simple storyline.  He crammed every bit he could into the storyline. <br /> <br /> <br />    But the book is a cliche.  Almost everything I've read that he put in are things I've read or heard before.  You probably won't get anything new out of this book by reading it.   <br /> <br />    What was up with the \\"Soul of *fill in*\\" anyway?  He introduces souls, and how everything in this world has souls.  How everything's connected by one language.  What kind of stuff is that?  It's some cult he believes in, I guess, but you won't gain anything from it.  You'll just frown with bewilderment because it's unneccessary flammery that he believes in. <br /> <br />    The translation is not very well done.  I noticed mistakes, and I am not good with grammer, or with english structure.  Many times, the book is a bore to read because of the lack of vibrant language in the translation. <br /> <br /> <br />    I decided to read this book because it had the 8th spot in the \\"top fantasy\\" catagory in amazon.  I don't even know why it's there.  Find a good work to read.  Not this badly translated, philosophy and cult/\\"spirits of the world\\" crammed book.   <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />    Also, I didn't like his mentioning of the Bible at all.  I am a Christian, and I'm guessing that the author's religion is some weird mixed up religion that's composed of the Bible, spirituality (everything has soul/spirit) and many more.  I would say that the author's \\"religion\\" or life philosophy, is messed up.  Where did he come up with these things?

B000BW7QWW|4.0|Back in the fall of 2002, there was a little show on FOX called FIREFLY created by Joss Whedon.  It never did well in the ratings and was pulled about half way through the season.<br /><br />I'll admit I was a casual fan at best of the show, watching about two thirds of the episodes.  Ironically, I really got into it after the cancellation news came out.  My biggest disappointment was that several story arcs were left with big question marks.  What exactly was going on?  Thanks to exceptionally strong sales of the show on DVD, we finally got to find out with this movie.<br /><br />Set 400 years in the future and a few months after the TV series ends, Malcolm Reynolds (Nathan Fillion) and his crew aboard the Firefly class star ship Serenity are still outlaws.  They make their living by conducting raids, sometimes for hire, and delivering black market merchandise to far parts of the galaxy.<br /><br />Also on board the ship is River Tam (Summer Glau), a fugitive from the intergalactic Alliance.  She was being programmed for something before she was rescued by her brother (Sean Maher).  The process has left her a shell of her old self, often babbling for no apparent reason.<br /><br />Her presence on the ship also makes the Serenity a much hotter item for the police of the Alliance government then it already was.  This is even more true when one Operative (Chiwetel Ejiofor) begins a dedicated search to return River to the program.  With the stakes raised, Malcolm makes it his mission to find the truth about River.  What he learns will send shockwaves through the galaxy and potentially bring the Alliance government to its knees.  That is, if the crew can get the truth out there for others to see.<br /><br />As I said, I was only a casual fan of the show and hadn't seen it since it went off the air.  Fortunately, the movie does a good job of reminding us about this particular science fiction universe before jumping into the new action.  This recap is done in an entertaining enough way not to bore those who rewatched their DVD's in preparation for the movie and contains enough background to bring new comers up to speed.<br /><br />Once the new information comes, the movie moves forward quickly.  Action scenes in the beginning are followed by new information that ultimate leads us to a conclusion I didn't expect.  The actors do a good job through all of this, making us care about the outcome.<br /><br />The show had a couple trademarks, both of which are present in the film.  While the show was a science fiction, there were western elements as well, from the planets to the old style weapons characters used.  This allows for some beautiful scenery as the ship is flying over landscapes and through horses.  Additionally, the characters had a very deadpan sense of humor that carries over well to the big screen.<br /><br />My only disappointment with the film was with Joss Whedon's story choices.  As with BUFFY and ANGEL, he felt the need to end this franchise with an apocalyptic finale that all the characters don't pull through.  While this is probably realistic, it's not why I go to the movies.  Also, since both the shows mentioned ended that way, it had a been there, done that feel to it, not the original climax that he was probably hoping for.<br /><br />I often complain when a show I like is canceled without a chance to tie up loose ends, so I'm glad this movie was made.  While it will appeal mainly to those who have seen FIREFLY, those not familiar with the TV show can enjoy it, too.  When I was done watching it, I felt satisfied with the story, even if I didn't like all of it.  While there are places the franchise could go from here, I am quite satisfied to let it rest in peace.entertaining enough way not to bore those who rewatched their DVD's in preparation for the movie and contains enough background to bring new comers up to speed. <br /> <br />Once the new information comes, the movie moves forward quickly.

However, as good as many of the recent crop of horror movies have been, they are all pretty much the same due to the villain being a person of flesh and blood, the only difference between them is the method the killer uses to dispatch his/her victims.  To shake things up former \\"X-Files\\" writer James Wong, crafted a new kind of horror film, one with the smart, sharp writing of the the 'Scream Trilogy', with talented young actors, and very unique death scenes that relied more on shock than on gore.  The biggest difference between this movie, \\"Final Destination\\" and all of the other successful horror movies of late, is that the killer is not some twisted individual, but rather Death itself, so it's not just a straight horror film, it's also a supernatural thriller. <br /> <br />\\"Final Destination\\" begins with a group of seniors in high school preparing to go on their senior trip to Europe, when one of them, a kid named Alex (Devon Sawa), experiences an intense vision of the plane exploding.  When the vision ends, Alex tries to write it off as just a bad daydream, until events in reality begin to match up with events in his dream, so Alex freaks out and is removed from the plane along with a small group of kids, some friends and the others are kids that are mad that Alex is being disruptive and were removed for their threats of violence.  After being removed from the plane, and witnessing the planes take-off occur without incident, the group believes that Alex was just crazy, but then the plane explodes and Alex's vision becomes frighteningly real.  Thinking they just survived a disaster and that their lives are now safe thanks to Alex, the kids begin to adjust back to their lives.  However, Death has a different idea for thisgroup, it seems Death has a plan, and Alex has ruined it's plan.  Now, Death is on a mission to claim the lives of the kids that got off of the plane in order to bring balance back to Death's grand design.  Knowing that he can see when Death is coming due to premonitions, Alex and his soon to be girlfriend, Clear (Ali Larter) attempt to thwart Death and save their remaining classmates. <br /> <br />Unique storytelling, solid performances from the entire cast, and a seamless blend of practical and CGI effects, allows \\"Final Destination\\" to rise above many other supernatural horror movies.  What really helps \\"Final Destination\\" is the fear of when Death will strike again, and since Death is an invisible force for the most part, in some scenes Death is foreshadowed by moving shadows on walls and other objects, this just adds to the thrills and chills.  Another wise move on the part of the director, James Wong, is to not use buckets and buckets of blood like most horror movies seem to do these days, instead scare the audience with the unknown, which is way more frightening.  While not everyone's type of movie, \\"Final Destination\\" should not be written off as just another horror movie in an already long list, but instead is more of a supernatural thriller that will at least deliver a scare or two to any viewer. <br /> <br />\\"Final Destination\\" is rated R for violence and language.
055380457X|4.0|Google is a search engine that millions of computer users have incorporated into their daily routine, so it's no surprise that someone decided to profile the two young mavericks -- Sergey Brin and Larry Page -- at the epicenter of such an amazing tale of success. In The Google Story $26.00 US, collaborators Vise & Malseed chronicle the company's meteoric launch, and the unique approach that has enabled its founders to stay one step ahead of the competition, while leaving few questions unanswered. I really enjoyed the team's breezy informational writing style, and I might have to read The Bureau and the Mole (also by David A. Vise) after finishing this.<br /><br />Ostensibly, the book hinges around: advertising on Google, AOL, Ask Jeeves, details of the PageRank system, employees of Google, Eric Schmidt's role at Google, the events of September 11th, international aspects of Google, Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers, the Michigan Digitization Project, Microsoft, Overture Inc., Privacy issues, the SEC, Stanford University, the stock price of Google, Venture capital firms, Yahoo!, and the company's admirable motto -- `Don't Be Evil' -- among other things. It was especially interesting to read about key dates and turning points, how the venture faced critical challenges, and how Brin and Page turned fleeting circumstance to their advantage. Ignoring prevailing wisdom would prove lucrative for both young men.<br /><br />Of course, no book is complete without photos, so you'll delight in the eight pages of black and white photography sandwiched between the pages of this non-fiction text. Some of these photos ran in Playboy, and USA Today, and it's nice that they were included, since you can eyeball the people profiled in the book. One photo shows Larry and Sergey in their first office, a garage in Menlo Park. Another shows the Googleplex campus in Mountain View, as seen from the Norden bombsight of a low-flying B-24 bomber. And one shows a polished Larry Page presiding over the opening of the NASDAQ stock exchange at the time of the Google IPO.<br /><br />Got free time? Like to Google? Here's who mixed with Larry Page at the William Gates Computer Science building at Stanford: Sean Anderson (creative), Tamara Munzner (geek), Lucas Periera (bouncy), and Ben Zhu (quiet). Sergey Brin had a different office, but camped at Gates 360, with Page and his associates. Four of Brin and Page's advisors/professors were: Dennis Allison, Hector Garcia-Molina, Rajeev Motwani, and Terry Winograd. What evolved into Google emerged from separate projects: one (MIDAS=Mining Data at Stanford) helmed by Brin and Motwani, whom were extracting information from large amounts of data, and the second (DLP=Digital Libraries Project) in which Page participated. Google is a mash up of those two efforts.<br /><br />Little details about Google fascinate. Did you know that Google was first known as `BackRub' in early 1997? Months later, Brin and Page decided they needed an improvement. After bouncing ideas off of each other, Sean offered up Googleplex, which Sergey shortened. After registration, Tamara told them they'd misspelled it. Another party had already registered the correct spelling, so Larry stuck with what they had. The simplicity of Google was dictated by circumstance, since the duo lacked the funds to hire a designer, or the artistic talent to implement anything better. I'd argue that the simplicity of their site is actually its `key selling point,' -- a fortunate accident if you will.<br /><br />Even though Larry and Sergey took pride in Google they were eager to sell it. Designing the PageRank system took ample time from their degree pursuits, when both men simply wished to resume regular studies. In March of 1999, at Palo Alto's Mandarin Gourmet restaurant, the duo pitched their superior search technology to AltaVista but incredibly, Alta Vista passed on it. They approached Excite and other search engines, but all the companies they tried to unload iton were disinterested. Yahoo! cofounder David Filo (Stanford alum) advised the duo to take a leave from their Ph.D. program and begin a business, even though he too passed on integrating Google into Yahoo!'s website.<br /><br />Stung by rejection the pair plodded along, improving Google for their university users, while delaying decisions. Five months later, angel investor Andy Bechtolsheim hands Larry Page a $100,000 check on David Cheriton's front porch and speeds off in his Porsche, to his next appointment. Bechtolsheim had reacted on gut instinct after a short presentation, and hadn't realized the gravity of what he'd done. David Cheriton, one of Larry and Sergey's graduate professors, served as the deal's matchmaker. Brin and Page hadn't even formally created a company when Bechtolsheim handed them that check. Larry had to lock it in a drawer for two weeks, until they were actually incorporated and had bank accounts.<br /><br />The boomtown climate of Silicon Valley in 1999 allowed companies to raise money through stock offerings, but Brin and Page were leery of revealing trade secrets. Brin and Page weren't in it for the money either. Both sought to improve and refine Google while maintaining control. Bechtolsheim's check -- paired with $1 million scraped together from family and friends -- got them started, but they quickly burned through the cash. They could smell success after licensing technology to RedHat, but needed a large chunk of money to stay aloft. One of two local venture capital firms were likely to keep them alive, either Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers, or Sequoia Capital.<br /><br />On the slim chance you're uninformed; I'll give you capsule summaries. Sequoia Capital is the VC firm that reaped huge profits when Yahoo! went public in 1996. Because Google was viewed as a potential vendor, Yahoo! and Sequoia wanted to help them. Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers, led by Doerr, is a VC firm that made a fortune by backing Compaq, Sun Micro, and Amazon.com before people conceptually realized what each were trying to do. Both VC firms wanted exclusive access to Google, to the exclusion of the other. That Brin got both firms to cooperate with him, and take equal $12.5M stakes in the company, is a testament to his business acumen.<br /><br />Readers will delight in the success of GoogleAds, whose profit-sharing revenue helped to lift the boat of Ask Jeeves, a previously bested rival (that once had a huge valuation) whom struggled with small sales before a three-year deal (valued at $100M) was forged with the Google Guys in 2001. After Steve Berkowitz took the helm at Ask Jeeves, he revamped a site that had was hard hit by a burst tech bubble. By acquiring Teoma, and partnering with Google's Eric Schmidt and Omid Kordestani, Berkowitz turned Ask Jeeves into one of Google's partners -- instead of allowing a bitter rivalry to fester. Without major audience overlaps, both firms benefited as a result.<br /><br />You'll probably enjoy reading The Google Story. You'll likely be impressed by the writing. Vise & Malseed make Brin and Page come alive on the page, even though the subject matter of this book had great potential to be dry and boring. The genesis of Google News was also an exciting portion of the book. The depth of the research surrounding the writing of this book is notable.

B00005JO1Y|5.0|KING KONG ROCKS I WAS ON THE EDGE OF MY SEAT IT WAS ONE HECK OF A ROLLER COASTER RIDE I WAS NOT EVEN SCARED A BIT AT ALL
B000BJS4BM|5.0|Madonna is riding high (thankfully not on horseback), and the well-executed electronica/dance formula of her new album, \\"Confessions on a Dance Floor\\" is indeed the culprit. Although her ambitious yet ultimately underwhelming 2003 disc \\"American Life\\" fizzled away soon after its release, it hardly forecasted her demise, for \\"Confessions\\" is a far more sturdy collection.<br /><br />Taking off with \\"Hung Up,\\" the Material Girl's 36th top-10 single, it is evident from the get-go that this album relies less on introspection than on sing-a-long choruses and frothy dance beats. Longer than its radio version, the track sounds even better stretched out to a majestic six minutes, until it blends into the hypnotic \\"Get Together\\" after a ticking alarm clock suddenly blasts. The pulsating track, which can best be described as an electronic freeze-out, will rub listeners in all the right places with its spare yet sexy lyrics and mercurial pace.<br /><br />The aptly titled \\"Let It Will Be\\" is a scintillating affair that takes the listener on an abbreviated ride on the roller coaster of Madonna's history, while maintaining the credo of its namesake. \\"Jump\\" and \\"How High?\\" follow the same self-effacement but delve deeper - beckoning listeners to make judgment calls about their own lives while still remaining personal. The former, which benefits from smoldering dance beats and a solid melody, belongs on the radio.<br /><br />Elsewhere, the vocoder-stuffed \\"Forbidden Love\\" is a slow-burning '80s throwback, while the pulsing synths of \\"Future Lovers\\" recall Donna Summer's disco classic \\"I Feel Love.\\" While delightfully retro, both songs are adventurous enough to suggest a futuristic sound. Fashioned similarly is \\"Sorry,\\" a tribute to those who simply cannot forgive.<br /><br />Other tracks include \\"Like It Or Not,\\" a blunt ode to self-sustenance, the tongue-twisting \\"Push\\" and \\"Isaac,\\" which reflects the diva's notorious interest in Kabbalah and contains Middle-Eastern chanting.<br /><br />The sole misstep on the collection is \\"I Love New York,\\" which has embarrassing lyrics and a choppy melody.<br /><br />Overall, \\"Confessions\\" is an infectious, high quality pop album that serves as yet another testament to Madonna's longevity. While it may not be as formidable as \\"Ray of Light\\" or \\"Like a Prayer,\\" it is a genuine gem.<br /><br />A deluxe edition includes an extra track, \\"Fighting Spirit,\\" a 40-page picture book, an 80-page journal book that includes some of Madonna's diary entries, and a one-month subscription to ICON, her fanclub.<br /><br />Last but not least, iTunes offers three different variations of the album, as well as assortment of club mixes of \\"Hung Up.\\"nting.  <br /> <br />The sole misstep on the collection is \\"I Love New York,\\" which has embarrassing lyrics and a choppy melody.  <br /> <br />Overall, \\"Confessions\\" is an infectious, high quality pop album that serves as yet another testament to Madonna's longevity.

B000BVD460|5.0|...and I know you will, but as tired as I personally am of MM, I have to allow that his talent is undeniable and this represents a solid run of top-notch rap singles...not a one of these tracks fails to entertain...
B000001IQH|5.0|It seems to me that punk rock needs 3 things to sound great:    1) good material and/or creativity  2) the band has to be incredibly tight--no excuses  3) a whole pile of visceral energy (at least 3.2 metric F-tons) that sends everything else to the background    ...and it turns out that 19 tracks that deliver, one after another,  doesn't hurt either :-) Rancid has the good stuff in spades.    This CD is a serious work-horse--every song, whether you heard it on the radio or not, stands up and kicks a**. I've rarely seen a disc that has no filler whatsoever, but this one clocks in at an un-heard-of filler-free 19! In a world where even half decent bands occasionally produce entire albums of filler, this one is a keeper.    I particularly like the bass-playing, which has a mean, clean, punchy sound, and continues to contribute something unique to every song. Also, the vocals are naked and forceful, which, IMHO, is exactly what punk rock is all about.    I guess what I'm trying to say is this:  Walk past Blink182 and Green Day, and _buy_this_album_--and be glad you didn't even have to pay for a double CD.
0446577383|2.0|I have read all the Balducci books and this book was \\"excruciating\\" to read. <br />I read 2/3 of the book and finally had to  quit. <br />Way too many unrelated characters and plots that never seem to mesh. <br />How could the editors have ever allowed this talented writer to produce this poor piece of mystery. <br />
B00000DOYR|3.0|Almost any song from this album could serve as an excellent definition of classic hard rock. The songs are great, but the album isn't, because it's repetetive. Having a CD with multiple AC/DC songs on it is like wearing two raincoats--it just shows that more of a good thing isn't necessarily better. AC/DC is openly against innovation in music, and it shows. They're  If you enjoy AC/DC on the radio (as I do), keep on enjoying it; it's best when it's one song at a time. If you actually buy the album, you're likely to be disappointed by the repetetiveness--unfortunately there's not much variation between songs.    On the other hand, if you are going to own one AC/DC album, this is probably the best choice.
B000BTC5LW|5.0|Yeah think they have the release date wrong - the same disc on the UK Amazon site has a release date of January 17 2006. <br /> <br />Brilliant DVD of a jaw-dropping concert. I was lucky enough to be at Earl's Court in London on the night they shot this video. Never seen anything like it before or since - the special effects were just out of this world, as was the music. We were treated to Dark Side all the way through without a break. Ended with Comfortably Numb with the huge glitter ball lowered down from the roof before it opened up in a hail of lasers and dry ice and Run Like Hell where they threw everything they had at it for a spectacular finale. An unbelievable experience and one that has taken far too long to make it to DVD! Very excited to put this through it's paces on a decent system and TV!
B000A2RRF4|3.0|I love some Michael Jackson songs. I was very excited when I bought this DVD as I tought I was going to hear some of my favorite Michael Jackson's songs played live. I was wondering how good did Michael sing his songs live hoping to find a new interest in these alredy beloved songs. I am dissapointed at the lack of quality singing by Michael. Of course, you can't ask for much as he is always dancing and jumping and when he gets to sing he is very excited, his heart beating fast so you can imagine the results: he hardly sings, the chorists always have to complete Michael's singing. Another dissapointing fact is the constant shots of people going into euphoria and fainting like if they saw God. It is really disturbing. This is a must have DVD for any Michael Jackson fan as it is the only live DVD of him available, but for the casual fan like me you should know that instead of seeing Michael Jackson actually SINGING you will see him dancing, shouting, touching himself alongs with obsessed fans needing medical attention. Some performances in this DVD like Billy Jean, Thriller are remarkable good tough. I say go for it just don't expect a whole singing performance rather than a dancing, touching himself performance.
B00005JOFO|5.0|I loved this movie so much I went back to see it the next day.  Heath Ledger's performance amazed me.  The scenery was beautiful and desolate.  It's a story of paths not taken and regret.
B000063DI9|2.0|I liked every maiden album before this one, so I expected a lot of this, but this album just has not the quality of Powerslave or Somewhere In time. To many average songs on this like Can I Play With Madness, Only The Good Die Young and The Evil That men Do. The rest is good, but not great. Infinite Dreams and the title track are my favorites of this album, and they are superb. But not the whole album is superb. Don't buy this unless you are a Die hard maiden fan!
068484267X|5.0|These harsh memoirs of a miserable Irish catholic childhood centre around a totally irresponsible alcoholic, but catholic, father. Bawling nationalist slogans, he prefers to be drowned in alcohol, rather than to buy food for his wife and many children: 'I didn't know how a man in his right mind can leave a wife and family to starve and shiver in a Limerick winter.' <br />This suicidal behaviour even prevents his children to have a good education, which is a vital national power factor. <br />But otherwise, he remains through and through a 'good' catholic (you may have sex, but it must be with profit). <br />His belief is however heavily tainted by protestant fatalism: 'Dear God, this is what you want, isn't it? You want my son Eugene. You took his brother, Oliver. You took his sister, Margaret. Dear God above, I don't know why children have to die, but that is Your will.' <br /> <br />The overall situation in Ireland before World War II was appalling: unemployment, hunger, poverty, alcoholism, illnesses, a high rate of child mortality, the hypocrisy of politicians, the rich and the clergy. <br />Children fought among themselves for apple peels. Some were barefoot the whole year long. <br />Catholic fundamentalism and sexual repression were more important than food, shelter and education.  <br />The school system for the poor was disastrous, run by brutal and stupid teachers, except one: 'this free independent Ireland that keeps a class system foisted on us by the English, that are throwing our talented children on the dungheap.' <br /> <br />Only a few members of the lower classes saw through the rampant Pharisaism. One of them was an uncle of the author who teached him a fundamental lesson for confronting life: 'Make up your own mind.' <br />Against all odds, the author took his fate in his own hands. <br /> <br />This is a deeply moving and desperate book about the struggle for survival in a family living just above the level of total destitution. <br />Not to bemissed.
B00004TH7Z|5.0|This is great, Bruce Dickinson has returned! I liked Bayley, but Bruce is much much better. Just buy this if you like metal, and it is a must if you are an iron maiden fan. This album is as good as something like Powerslave!
B000BVD460|5.0|personally i dont think he is leavin..................yet. i think he will make one last album. he will be workin hard on this last album. this album is a good album obviously because it has all of his numba 1 hits. his new song WHEN IM GONE should not be on this album. this song is very good and it basically talkin about how he is always talkin about his daughter in his songs, yet he is ignorin her. she wants him 2 be with her instead of him leavin all da time. i think dis song should of been on his very last album. he just wasted it on this.
B00002MZ2C|5.0|Yes. I think that The Battle of Los Angeles is Rage Against the Machine's best album. It is light years away from \\"Evil Empire\\" and just beats out their 1992 self-titled debut by about a hair. As a long time Rage fan, you must be thinking I am high. No I am not. This is great because not only is every song good, but there are about 10-11 great songs. Not one song on this album is bad enough to be skipped over... in fact none of them are bad at all. This is Rage Against the Machine's overlooked and underrated album. If you even hint that Limp Bizkit is anywhere near Rage, you should be stoned to death. <br /> <br />Even though Battle of Los Angeles would be Rage Against the Machine's last album with their own songs (they released an album of covers of old songs in 2000 before they broke up and then a live album in 2003) it does not mean that they faded. They got better. Tom Morello plays the best guitar riffs I have ever heard, Zack de la Rocha returns with his angry political rapping and bassist Tim Commerford and drummer Brad Wilk are their usual great selves. This album beats the hell out of any rap-metal band imaginable, and if you even beg to differ, death to you. <br /> <br />So, the album consistency on this is out of this world. Out of 13 songs, about 10 or 11 of them are classics, and the other two are great. If every album would be like this, then the music world would be a great place. Even though people think Rage is another bad rap-metal band, it has a political meaning, the guitarist Tom Morello is brilliant and the lead singer/rapper Zack de la Rocha is no Fred Durst. The lyrics aren't f**k you, f**k this, f**k your mother, f**k the world, but issues that are way more important than Fred Durst's life.  <br /> <br />O yeah! I almost forgot about the songs. \\"Testify\\" is a crazy opener that is one of my personal favorites. \\"Guerrilla Radio\\", a popular radio song is easily the best song on the album that never gets stale. It seems like it is so short because it's that great, but its really three minutes long. \\"Calm Like A Bomb\\" will blow you away with Tom Morello's crazy riffs. \\"Sleep Now In The Fire\\" and \\"Born of a Broken Man\\" are easily 10/10 in my books. \\"Born As Ghosts\\" and \\"Maria\\" are the non-superior tracks, but still great. And the immortal \\"New Millenium Homes\\" is the third best song on the album. The others like \\"Voice of the Voiceless\\", \\"Ashes In The Fall\\" and \\"War Within A Breath\\" are also great that just add to the album's depth. <br /> <br />So if you want to listen to the best band in the 90's, then pick up any Rage albums, especially this one and their self titled, because even though they only released three albums, they will forever live on as the most political and controversial metal acts ever. As he would say it himself, F**k Fred Durst and f**k Limp Bizkit fans and Long live Rage Against the Machine!
B0007P3582|1.0|Guess who's back? 50 Cent. And so am I so I can tell the people of America the worst album of 2005. Last year Ashlee Simpson's \\"Autobiography\\" took home honors, and now 50 Cent's \\"The Massacre\\" is our new award winner. And for all the gangster suburban teenyboppers who are going to give me a bunch of negative votes when this review will save your life, or at least your music life, unless you commit suicide after spending your hard, earned cash on trash from 50 Cent. <br /> <br />I like music. I listen to music acts like Metallica, The Rolling Stones, The Doors, The Who and The Beatles. Also as for modern performers, I like listening to rappers like Nas, Jay-Z, Kanye West and nu-metal acts like System of a Down. Old rap like Public Enemy, Beastie Boys and the fathers of gangsta rap, N.W.A. and Ice Cube. So, this is talented performers. And then along comes this whole little commercial bubble-gum pop-rap like 50 Cent, G-Unit and Twista and all that other garbage. They release albums, get played out on MTV and the radio and become multi-billionaires with bodyguards, cooks and drivers. <br /> <br />50 Cent's \\"The Massacre\\" is torture. ALl the beats suck. Especially on the hit \\"Just A Lil Bit\\", which is quite possibly the worst song written in the last 15 years. \\"Disco Inferno\\" is a carbon-copy of \\"On Fire\\" from Lloyd Banks. And then \\"Candy Shop\\"... 50 Cent dissed Ja-Rule for making queer, wimpie songs with Ashanti. So he makes a bubble-gum pop song like \\"Candy Shop\\" with Olivia who has half the talent of Ashanti. The biggest disgrace ever is that 50 Cent ruined Ja-Rule, yet he is copying his exact style which would lead to Ja-Rule's downfall, which now its 50 Cent's downfall. Everything else wouldn't cut it on any other album, and are just filler.  <br /> <br />Since 2003's \\"Get  Rich or Die Tryin'\\", 50 Cent has completely been hypocritical acting like he is all hard and he is really not because he ain't shooting or killing anyone lately. Get lost buddy, because maybe agreat 2Pac type rapper will come along and show the rap long and put an end to 50 Cent. That will be the day... as for now, your mission is to show everyone who listens to this some great rap, like Public Enemy or the Beastie Boys. ANd then get them into good rock. So white kids, give me all negative votes, cause you know that this sucks!
B000002UJQ|4.0|OK Computer is by far the best Radiohead album out and the only one worth a definite buy. I say this because all the songs are distinctly unique, and cover musical ranges from computerised melodies to raw and hard guitar works. <br /> <br />My favourites are: <br />Let Down- This song is so painfully beautiful, I can't do it any justice. By far one of Radiohead's greatest achievements. <br />It's a song for yourself when you feel suffocated. <br />Karma Police- Perfect \\"get what you deserve\\" song. It's all about suffering the consequences, which I like. <br />Electioneering- Manic energy. This song is pure electricity. It makes me feel supercharged. <br />Climbing Up The Walls- The ultimate stalker song. I like that you get the feel that the persona is thoroughly obssessed. <br />No Surprises- Undoubtedly the prettiest song on the album. <br /> <br />Those songs alone are worth the purchase.The other songs are above average. However, I absolutely think Lucky is one of the worst songs I ever heard. In the end,you'll find a song on that album that is just for you.
1400043662|5.0|I don't claim to fully understand either ending of the two amazing stories told here. What I love about both is the way Murakami can play with diunal time and soultime as well as telepathy and history.<br /><br />After reading this book straight through in one long day and into the night, I felt cleansed. For several nights, I had vivid and wonderful dreams. Why so? Because and I'm only guessing here, HM goes into realms of our lives that few of us dare enter, the mysterious which is also our realities, and so, his work if well read is also catharis for the reader, or it was for me. Monumental and memorable are the times and spaces he traverses what is hard to do without such a book.
0066214122|5.0|Before reading \\"Prey\\" (2002), I don't recall having read *any* of Michael Crichton's books as an adult.  I'd seen several movies based on his work (\\"The Andromeda Strain,\\" \\"Jurassic Park,\\" \\"Sphere,\\" and \\"Timeline\\"), and I knew Crichton created the TV show \\"ER,\\" which my wife has watched religiously over the years.<br /><br />At first I was a little daunted by the book's 500-plus pages, but Crichton's prose was so easy to read that I just breezed through the entire novel in less than a weekend.  While his technological explanations were a little bit repetitive, they successively built on each other, and weren't as obtrusive as the stereotypical \\"infodumps\\" in \\"old-school\\" science fiction (\\"Gosh, Doc, how does that work?\\" \\"Well, Jimmy, as you already know, the Universal Transmogrifier can easily rearrange matter at the atomic level, using...\\" [Contemporary reader slips into coma at this point]).<br /><br />Like a friend who admits to feeling like he's sold out when he listens to Top 40 radio after being exposed to the Canadian progressive rock group Rush, I had to wrestle with (apparently false) guilt at reading what felt like \\"sci-fi lite.\\"  But Crichton does a good job of showing how his \\"What if?\\" projections directly affect his three-dimensional characters.  Granted, I could see some of the \\"foreshadowed\\" clues from a mile away, but Crichton's painting in wide strokes may explain why his novels adapt so easily to the movie format, which doesn't work effectively as often as you'd think.  Crichton also pulls some completely unexpected surprises out of his hat in this story, as well.<br /><br />I discovered that Crichton's work is listed as \\"Fiction,\\" rather than \\"Science Fiction,\\" but hopefully that exposes his stories to a much wider audience, instead of relegating it to what some might call the SF ghetto.  Some \\"hard science\\" advocates will no doubt find something to nitpick about, but I \\"suspended my disbelief/And I was entertained\\" (paraphrased, \\"Mystic Rhythms,\\" _Power Windows,_ Rush).<br /><br />A lot better than I'd hoped it would be, and a pretty easy read.  Let's see what *else* young Mr. Crichton is up to...Rhythms,\\" _Power Windows,_ Rush). <br /> <br />A lot better than I'd hoped it would be, and a pretty easy read.

B000BO0LLS|5.0|She should get her fair share of Grammies come awards time.  This album was so good and sucessful it deserved to be re-released in this form.  The new hit \\"Don't Forget About Us\\" further proves Ms Carey's staying power.  Her vocals are incredible.  I also enjoy the videos on the second DVD.  This special Ultra Platnum Edition is the perfect Holiday gift for Mariah Carey fans.  Thank you, Mariah and Universal for this special collection. A MUST HAVE for MC fans.
B000065AQU|5.0|System of a Down is an awesome band, for all you SOAD haters (as seen below) :) This album completely rocks, there isn't a bad song on it. SOAD is a little strange, yes, but so is Maynard from Tool/APC. System of a Down is a very talented group and I personally appreciate the way they express their beliefs through their music. This album, along with all the other SOAD albums, is definetely worth listening to and buying.
B000BW7QWW|5.0|Joss Whedon creates a masterpiece in Serenity. With Whedon it is all about the characters. And you can't help but care about the crew of Serenity.  They are the underdogs in the story and they are so likable you can't help but root for them. <br /> <br />The movie does well to explain where main thread of the story comes from, but to really appreciate it you need to see the original series 'FireFly'. <br /> <br />The movie has a lot of drama, action, humor... everything you could want in a story.   But the real reason to appreciate it is that the characters have a sense of what is right. And they are willing to give up everything; including their lives for 'what is right'. <br /> <br />My only complaint with the DVD is the extras:  They show deleted scenes, and after watching them you can tell why they were deleted.  They should have left the 'bonus' material off the DVD release. It just lets you know that the editors did their job.
B00008HCCF|4.0|I am not sure if it is insecurity, or simply being sweet to the members of her band, or a strong willed manager, but Norah has absolutely lost my appeal to her live shows and DVD's, as she seems to now be a sidekick to her band.  We want Norah, not all of the noise that drowns out her beautiful, rich soulful voice - it is so sad, but many musicians seem to succumb to that temptation.  For instance, I was so grateful seeing James Taylor send his band away at some point during a concert and and simply sit there on the stage and play his guitar solo - it was absolutely spine tingling. I hope that some day Norah will regain her rightful position, and put the rest of the band where they need to be, which is in support of her, as opposed to some type of unneccessary substitute for her. Please give us Norah back so that we can hear her and her piano, and turn the rest of the band down !
B000BFH2S2|5.0|Until the day comes when I am fortunate enough to see Mr. Buble in the flesh at some concert hall or Vegas/AC nightclub, this fabulous CD/DVD set will do just fine, thank you.   <br /> <br />It's been just a couple of years since the record-buying public (including myself) gave this talented young man a first listen, and with every release since then, he has consistently wowed us with his amazing vocal prowess and stage presence.  The entire package is first-rate (even the extras on the DVD that won't even air on PBS). <br /> <br />I am praying that Mr. Buble will one day descend on Sinatra's old turf (Capitol studio A) and put his own magical stamp on more of the great songs his idols made famous (and of course, the new ones). FIVE STARS IS JUST NOT ENOUGH!!!!        <br />
B000AMWIVM|4.0|Saw is a mindblowing story that really gets your mind thnking, instead of just watching teenagers get slashed up by a masked killer.  Would recommend to anyone who enjoys the horror genre and enjoys and critical thinking.
B0001LJCMK|4.0|Definitely get this shambling, sloppy get-together of QOTSA's Josh Homme and friends. The Eagles ratchet up Jaggeresque lyrical machismo/decadence to an even funnier level than Mick himself does while staggering thru a noisy barroom blues practice session. Sure, there's not much \\"talent\\" going on here, but it is loads of fun, and I have always thought that was what counts. I don't think I'd be a rock fan otherwise, would I?
B000BKVQTS|3.0|I'd give it 3.5 stars if I could.  It's definitely not a 5-star film, but it's also not a disaster.  I disagree with the reviews that criticize the CG effects, which seemed as good as any to me.  I also felt that the acting was quite good overall.  My main objection was the inconsistent tone of the movie, with comic remarks being injected in scenes that were otherwise dark and forbidding.  At times, this worked quite well, but at other times, it just fell flat.  Still, it was obvious that the actors and the director had a great time making the film, and their total involvement was the film's saving grace.  There was a great deal of time and talent put into the project, and that it fell somewhat short of the goal is no crime.
B000C1YL1G|5.0|I've been the biggest Eminem fan for the longest time. I think that this is a great CD, & including \\"Stan's Mixtape\\" was a good choice for him. Some previous reviews said he shoulda put \\"Forgot About Dre\\" \\"Words Are Weapons\\" & \\"Purple Pills\\". Well, If you think about it, those aren't Eminem songs. \\"Forgot About Dre\\" is a Dre song that features Eminem. \\"Words Are Weapons\\" & \\"Purple Pills\\" are D12 songs. Although Eminem is in D12, it's not Eminem, it's D12, so their not HIS songs. This is an Eminem greatest hits, not a D12 greatest hits. I think that he only left off 2 songs from the CD, those are \\"White America\\" & \\"Mosh\\". Other than that, it's a Grade A CD. Way to go Em. <br />
B0007PAMR4|5.0|This DVD should be great. But people looking for a complete or mythical 6 hour version are the same people looking for the Holy Grail. This is the best we are going to get it seems. (Unless they can find missing footage. Was it mysteriuosly destroyed like Blue Velvets?) After the Lord of the Rings success I hope filmakers revisit the Dune Series. The Lynch one is great and visually stunning, but the books and further story have much to relate to in today's world.(Robots going wild, the drug trade, bad Leaders, war etc.)  Someone like Peter Jackson should make the Dune series of movies. A master at making thick and interesting literary material into a visual narrative he could and should make the Dune books a reality. If the unfilmable Lord of the Rings can be made, and made well, Dune deserves another look. until that happens, this DVD should be watched and put in the context of Lynch's life and films. Which is of the highest quality.
B000002IG4|5.0|When I wrote a review of another album and referred to it as a redheaded stepchild, I realized that this album may be the mother of redheaded stepchild albums - albums that become ignored by their creators and by the listening public. Once again, we have an album that gets only one song on the greatest hits - despite being chock full of some of the finest work of the artist's career. \\"I Don't Care Anymore\\" improves upon \\"In the air Tonight\\" in every way - lyrics that are angrier and more concise, music that cuts to the chase with intense, stark drumming from the get-go. Feeling ticked off? Try screaming along to this in your car. \\"I Cannot Believe it's True\\" and \\"It Don't Matter to Me\\" both use uptempo, EW&F brass to punctuate driving songs from the edge of a breakup. \\"Don't let him Steal your Heart Away\\" is one of the best songs ever to describe the too-little-too-late feelings of accountability that crop up as a relationship turns to dust. It's heartbreaking. \\"Do you know, Do you Care\\" and \\"Thru These Walls\\" are dark and scary (that's right, Phil Collins making music that is dark and scary!), plunging us into the depths of a troubled mind, frought with anger and paranoia. Particularly the unsettling \\"Walls,\\" which I've heard is either about how much Phil misses his kids or a fictionalized account of a separated guy deposed to a hotel room, being emotionally tortured by the sounds of a couple's lovemaking coming from the room next door. Whichever, it's a creepy, pervy-sounding song. I don't want to give the impression that listening to this is an overly depressing affair. The musicianship is first-rate, the tune selection varied. It's the last of Phil's deeply personal, handmade albums. Within a couple years, he'd get married, find happiness and dominate the world as one of the biggest pop stars of the decade (Really. The year Phil had in '85 is possibly trumped only by Michael Jackson's '83). He'd never return to this kind of introspective, nakedly personal work.This is a rock-solid offering that deserves to be heard.
0689859414|5.0|The ink drawings in the Spiderwick series, while quite good, don't hint at the talent of their illustrator, Tony DiTerlizzi, which is displayed in its full glory in this book.  These illustrations are so good they kind of make you wish DiTerlizzi could illustrate everything.  I'm definitely getting a copy, as well as any other illustration books by this illustrator.
B000AXSN5G|2.0|When I bought this Cd I was hoping to hear Neil Young doing what he does best - the liquid, thin voice along with dramatic background music.  <br />Unfortunately, the CD is full of loser sounds, the ones you skip over on other CDs. They all sound like \\"filler\\" songs and to me were more irritating that anything. The musicians sound cheap and poorly shosen, and bad. Sorry, but Neil has much more talent than this.
B000002H92|2.0|In Concert is a series of Doors songs taken from various concerts during their more raucous period.  As someone who prefers live vs. studio 99% of the time I was hoping for more from this album.  I refuse to believe that these were the best versions of these songs and this album is pretty much plauged by bad choices.    I never really bought into Morrisson's \\"poetry\\" nor all of his psychadelic mind freeing mantras.  He blabs and blabs on many of the tracks rendering them pretty much unplayable.  There are some fantastic instances of the rest of the band's brillaince shining through such as in Love Me Two Times and Break on Through.  Unfortunately there are just two many instances of Morrisson going off on some tangent or screaming into the microphone.    Bottom Line:  If drunken rambling at nauseum is your thing then this is the record for you.
B000BTJDGC|4.0|This movie to me is how (nonbelevers) trust olny what they csn see. I mean people alway lean tord what they can see, like a child invisable friend they want us to beleve that it is a child immagistion but realy is a angel. This movie has the same idea. I love the part where god call Emaily outside and she ask god \\" Why didn't the demons leve me tonight\\" and god told her thst it would not let them live because people have to understand that the devil is real. That wes a grate sceen. The cast was good, like the man who seid that she wes sick, he made me hate him.
B00070Q7VO|4.0|Michael Buble's debut was great.  His proper follow-up studio album  \\"It's Time\\" is just as good, if not better. <br /> <br />The voice is great.  Very warm and entertaining.  He's not like some other male jazz singers who you either like or hate.   <br /> <br />The instrumentation is really cool and laidback.  Very cool hipster atmosphere throughout.   <br /> <br />This is timeless music and I'm sure it'll still sound good 10 or 20 years from now.  Highly recommended!
B000B7BRMM|5.0|Is the best christmas songs cd I bought. Diana Krall has a lovely voice. It worth every penny.
B00005JO9J|5.0|I have never been much of a TV watcher, I prefer to read, however, I was hooked on this show when I saw the previews. I have never missed an episode, will not let anyone interupt my Sunday night viewing, and have sat here salivating while waiting to see when Season 1 will be out! <br />The show has amazing depth mixed with hilarious comments and situations. Each character is written and acted with such realistic qualities that I feel like my best friends have left when each show is over.  <br />This is by far, one of the best drama's in a long time.
B00005JO1Y|2.0|Forget what the CGI nerds are saying. This film was utterly overdone. <br /> <br />Too long <br />Pointless action <br />Absurd situatons with the Characters <br /> <br />Go see it yourself. Be your own judge. Don't be a sucker for what these clowns are claiming. PJ is a good director. But King Kong will be the film most remember for it's mediocre storytelling and entertainment.
B000002ADT|5.0|You know when something like this genre is simply awesome when it is listed at #87 on the top bought cd's on amazon.com for today, December 20, 2005. That just amazes me because this cd will never lose its powerful meaning, for being put out so many years ago. Miles Davis as many know was original and there will never be anyone like him ever again. I get chills everytime when Miles hits the first note of \\"So What\\" I enjoy taking periodical visits to heaven quite often, because you can never go wrong with COOL AND TRANE
0618001905|4.0|The author mentions how he first came to learn of the atrocities mentioned in this book through a inconspicuous footnote he read while researching Samuel Clemens.  After reading this book, it is truly surprise how such brutality could almost be forgotten from the common knowledge.  Not surprisingly, it is a brutality fed by a voraciousness that is thoroughly modern in its appetite.  However, for anyone interested in reading about the history of Africa, The Congo, or even Belgium or Victorian culture, this book is a must
0452282152|4.0|This book is set in the 1600's in Delft. A family is is on the verge of poverty so they send their daughter Griet to be a maid at the Vermeer household. She is not greatly liked by anyone is the home. Griet becomes Vermeer's assistant. As his assistant she falls in love with him. He does not show the same affection towards her. A very rich man wants a painting of Griet. She doesn't want to do it. The rich man wants to be in the picture with her and this angers Vermeer. The rich man want Griet to himself. This book is full of death, love, and Hate. It's a wonderful read.
0446310786|5.0|Harper Lee does a great job of developing the characters in this book.  Filled with the pains of growing up and seeing racism in the South through the eyes of a child is an eye opening experience.
B000AARKOO|5.0|The message of the movie is very simple :  <br /> <br />Despite wars having taken place, despite excess having been committed and blood spelled unnecessarily, there is still plenty of room for peace and mutual respect between christians and muslims, providing one is interested in \\"genuine peace\\" as opposed to \\"tactical peace\\". <br /> <br />After all, don't they both believe in ONE creator and in the messengership of Jesus (son of the virgin Mary) (pbut) ?. <br /> <br />That being said, this movie have been debased from every corner of the mainstream media because the tiny fraction of people who are running the show do not want peace in the world and certainly not between muslims and christians. They thrive on spreading fear and hatered, their bank account gets inflated by crisis and wars taking place. World peace will drive them into bankruptcy. <br /> <br />Plain and Simple. <br /> <br />Are you free enough to open doors you are told not to open ?. <br />Are you brave enough to leave the beaten path ?. <br /> <br />
1559409002|5.0|Candace Hilligoss superb as Mary. <br /> <br /> What gets me we're always hearing about overrated types like Sondra Bullock, Meg Ryan, Sharon Stone, et al--who haven't got half the talent as Hilligoss.  <br /> <br />How does that happen? Sadly, it happens all the time. <br />(It happened to Judith O'Day, who appeared in the original Night of the Living Dead, and it happened to the gifted Marilyn Burns, who had the lead in the original Texas Chainsaw Massacre. Am totally baffled why these absolutely excellent actresses were never used again. I don't get it, and never will.  <br />I mean nobody, BUT NOBODY HAS EVER TURNED IN A MORE POWERFUL FILM PERFORMANCE THAN MARILYN BURNS! Her turn as \\"Sally\\" simply fries your brain. Not to mention the incredible job of acting by the great Edwin Neal in the same film as the Hitchhiker... Where is the fairness? These folks should have been given some special award ages ago! Why didn't it happen? Why doesn't it happen now? Because they were all in a horror film? So what? Horror is a legitimate genre. Why should it ever matter that it was horror? A strong, believable performance is a STRONG, BELIEVABLE PERFORMANCE.) <br /> <br />Also, the director here: Herk Harvey, directs rings around the  over-publicized types like Robert Rodriguez, Quentin Tarentino, Coppolla, Spielburg... This guy was way better than Wes Craven, George Romero (who lifted plenty from Carnival of Souls, by the way), Eli Roth and their ilk...and yet when Carnival of Souls, made for paltry thirty grand in Lawrence, Kansas, first came out in the early 1960s it was panned by the ignorant critics... <br /> <br />What does that tell you? Two things: Don't pay attention to  critics-- & it appears that those with the least amount of talent very often are praised to the sky. <br /> <br />Herk Harvey, producer/ director, John Clifford, the screenwriter, and their lead Candace Hilligoss, created an undisputed horror classic.  <br /> <br />In addition, kudos to Candace Hilligoss'es co-stars. <br /> <br />Unfortunately, due to the drubbing received by the so-called professional film critics, Mr. Harvey, a documentarian by trade, never made another feature. Our loss. <br /> <br />
0307276902|1.0|I was so excited to read this book after all the \\"can't put it down\\" hype.  Because there was a wait list at the library I purchased the book because I couldn't wait to read it.  My advice is, if you're that curious, borrow it from the library rather than wast your money.  Can't put it down?!  I could more than easily put it down from the first page forward.  It is EXTREMELY repetitive.  So he vomits AGAIN. ZZZZZzzzzzz.  Quite the opposite of gripping.
B000BBOUU4|3.0|I enjoyed this movie very much; more than I expected, actually.  I thought Johnny Depp did a great job portraying Willie Wonka.  I do not understand the comparison to Michael Jackson.<br /><br />The story line remains unchanged in this movie.  A poor boy wins one of only 10 tickets to tour the Willie Wonka chocolate factory.  Throughout the factory tour, the less well-behaved children begin to have negative experiences (such as blowing up as a huge blueberry and falling into a vat of melted chocolate).<br /><br />The Charlie character is sweet and lovable as is the grandfather.  The Oompah Loompahs are still cool, though they're all played by the same actor in this version of the movie.<br /><br />I would recommend this movie to relax.  Nothing to take too seriously.
B0000012YO|4.0|This set contains sonatas 2-7, 8, 10-21, 23, 25-31, as well as the Eroica Variations and a few unpublished sonatas.  The missing sonatas are 1, 9, 22, 24 and 32.<br /><br />I assume this is a compilation of the recordings released individually throughout the years on DG, most of which I have.  If so, these are autumnal recordings, but still marked by Gilel's fantastically accurate technique, featuring a large sound, very clean textures and a very free approach to tempo, particularly in the later sonatas.  It's a pity that Gilel's recording of the last (and in my opinion greatest) sonata was omitted from this compilation. I know it exists, issued by DG on a single CD paired with a couple of early unpublished sonatas, since I own it also.  Perhaps (hopefully) it is included, and Amazon simply forget to list it.  Since I do not actually own this set, but rather the individual releases, I can't say one way or the other. It's for this omission only that I give this set a 4; the individual recordings themselves are an unqualified 5 throughout.<br /><br />I find Gilels' interpretations very satisfying.  He delivers especially deeply felt readings of the later sonatas.  I have a particular affection for his interpretation of Op.109, partly because I've played it myself.  The opening sequence  emerges like one long plaintive sigh and the rest of the movement maintains this eloquent balancing of sorrow and dignity.  Gilels can generate immense sound and execute the most intricate passages with clarity and subtlety.  In all the sonatas here, I think he captures the spirit of each phrase and each passage with exceptional fidelity.<br /><br />I doubt anyone who buys this set will be disappointed.
B0007ACVHI|5.0|Since classical cellists consider these pieces the summit of the art, and since they've been recorded by practically all of the greats--Rostropovich, Casals, Ma, et al--you would need considerable patience, expertise and a book length study to compare all the fine points of the various performances. Fortunately, complex analysis isn't necessary in order to recommend this set of discs by Maria Kliegel. <br /> <br />I first heard Kliegel in performances of Kodaly's daunting cello pieces (on two highly recommended discs from Naxos) and her Bach is no disappointment. This is a cellist of the first rank, playing a Stradivarius, beautifully recorded in digital sound at bargain basement prices. Naxos is often a hit or miss label, but when they get it right like this they leave the big (expensive, dull) labels in the dust.
B000003TA4|4.0|4 stars, 4 good songs. Smells Like Teen Spirit ranks one of my all time favorite songs. Also good, In Bloom, Come As You Are, <br />& Lithium. Rest of the CD, out of control. Don't buy it. <br />Buy it for those 4.
B00005JO1Y|4.0|A great movie can be determined by the hours passed without feeling the urge to go to the toilet even if a movie takes three hours long.  Peter Jackson has made his name in making great fantasy movie and \\"King Kong\\" did just that for me, making me escape from the real world for that three hours.  Audience cringed, laughed, awed, sobbed along the way.  This movie was handled with a great sensitivity.  Where the \\"Godzilla\\" remake failed miserably few years back, \\"King Kong\\" opted for a more intimate story line where the three hours were used wisely to build the depth of characters and also to give audience an educated background information regarding blossoming relationship of the giant ape and Ann Darrow.  \\"King Kong\\" seemed to be divided into four half sessions:  first quarter was rather slow moving, showing us the difficulty of making a dime during the Depression era and what made Ann decided to take the journey to the Far East to make a living and explaining to the audience how the movie director, Denham and the writer, Jack Driscoll met up with Ann at the first place.  By now, audience that had watched Peter Jackson's movies before such as \\"Heavenly Creatures\\" and \\"Frighteners\\" would be familiar with his close-up portrait shots of people and moving scenes.  Then, second quarter concentrated on the ship, introducing us to the ship crew (some of them would be killed off one by one later), and building up of the tension between the passengers and the crew as they discovered of Denham's ulterior motive of heading to Skull Island.  Some audience giggled due to some similarity to \\"Titanic\\"'s deck scene between Kate Winslet and Leonardo.  Third quarter went up a notch with the meeting of the \\"friendly\\" locales of the Skull Island, the misadventures with the creatures in the jungle (many highlights here with those dizzying camera swivels focusing on the dinasours stampede, the fight between Kong and many creatures to save Ann Darrow, crew struggling to keep themselves alive from many giant insects) and the tender moment when Kong's eyes betrayed his feelings for Ann Darrow and when she reciprocated back her feeling, and last quarter, the final show down on top of Empire States Building between Kong and the bi-planes and the last time, we bid farewell to the misunderstood creature.  Suffice to say that the graphics were truly outstanding and what's even more outstanding is that it's made in Wellington, New Zealand.  The set was sumptuous, made in Art Deco style, the in-thing in the 1930's.  Naomi Watts, Jack Black, Andy Serkis, Adrien Brody were truly true to form and they truly engaged the audience.  It's not difficult to feel a lump in our throat upon leaving the cinema thinking of \\"Kong\\" and his love for the girl that he loved.  \\"Gorillas in the Mist\\" starring Sigourney Weaver was another movie that you should watch if you want to find out more about the silverbacks.  There were many instances where Peter Jackson divulged to us the Kong's dead family members in his lair, his diet comprising of vegetables.  We simply need to be mindful upon watching the movie.  For those that are curious about the insects, please search for a book item produced by WETA that are available for sale, giving us a background information of all of them and other creatures that lived in Skull Island.  Talking about \\"God is in details\\", the Peter Jackson let their imagination takes flight in imagining the ecosystem that creates and sustains the habitat in that island.  A very personal movie for Peter Jackson and a movie that MUST be viewed on the big screen.  Highly recommended

B000002HMH|3.0|Well,this is a difficult task-reviewing Load,the reason Metallica's so-called hardcore group left them. <br /> <br />First of all,let me make it clear that no album Metallica makes will have an easy time displacing the first four from my heart.That said,I have to be impartial and give my honest impression of Load.Here goes- <br /> <br />1.Ain't My Bitch:After the awesome production of the Black Album I was expecting the same from its successor and this song does not dissapoint.It is the hardest rocker Metallica has made in the last decade and I love it-for the music.Lyrically,this could be Hetfield's nadir as far as I am concerned. <br /> <br />2.2X4:Good song and I appreciate it more everytime I listen to it. <br /> <br />3.The House Jack Built:Very nice effort at being creepy and good work by Kirk Hammett. <br /> <br />4.Until It Sleeps:This  became a concert regular and I can't see why.However,I will give credit to Lars for being nicely understated and I love Kirk's outro to this song. <br /> <br />5.King Nothing:Again I don't think too well of the lyrics but this is probably the best song on the album.  <br /> <br />6.Hero Of The Day:The only place to hear this is on S&M.It doesn't impress here.Mediocre at best. <br /> <br />7.Bleeding Me:Lovely song overall with a wonderful second half. <br /> <br />8.Cure:Oh please!Horrible stuff by such geniuses? <br /> <br />9.Poor twisted me:Another attempt at being creepy but it fails. <br /> <br />10.Wasting My Hate:The second hardest rocker here and I like it.It is short and this prevents Metallica's one-riff structure from making it boring. <br /> <br />11.Mama Said:This is quite obviously James' song and I must say Kirk is excellent after the first verse. <br /> <br />12.Thorn Within:Good song with poor lyrics.I felt a lot more could have been done with it.Just when it starts to build up,they cut it down.For the first time Metallica's song-writing abilities have failed them. <br /> <br />13.Ronnie:I like this song andkeep a ear out for the right speaker;Kirk is scintillating. <br /> <br />14.Outlaw Torn:Good song to finish with though it is a little too long.Follows a similar pattern to Bleeding me and also has a great second half with a really heavy riff! <br /> <br />So overall it is far from this band's best though it is not their worst.The songwriting is poor for the first time ever but some of the riffs are pretty good.One thing is for sure,it seems as if Lars played the same beat for almost all the songs.This can get boring.I like to see speed changes! <br />Good attempt at being different and surely better than ReLoad.
B000002J09|2.0|I'll give this CD 2 stars because I like 2 songs on this Led <br />Zeppelin IV. The songs are Rock and Roll, and Stairway to Heaven. <br />I bought this CD because Stairway to Heaven was one of the greatest rock and roll songs of all time. The rest of this <br />album is just noise. Green Day's new album is better. <br />Blah!!!! See ya later rock fans. <br />Love Waiting for a Girl Like You, <br />Sincerely, The Heavy Rocking Guitar Solo Kid. <br />
B000002H33|5.0|Okay so when you pop in Metallica's third studio album I presume that you have already heard Kill 'em All and Ride The Lightning.So you probably know that Metallica is capable of playing any given piece of music at the speed of light.Fade To Black also proved that they can be slow,introspective yet brilliant.So what exactly does Master have for you? <br />    Well probably the first thing that struck me was how similar this sounds to Ride The Lightning.Same format and similar songs.The intro of Sanatarium is similar to Fade To Black and the song follows a similar pattern.I prefer the latter. <br />    That said, nothing can take away the sheer class of this record.I consider Damage Inc. to be my favourite thrash song ever and Cliff Burton's work on Orion is simply stunning.Master Of Puppets is Metallica's best title track ever with a superb middle section. <br />   Overall,the songwriting does not slip in a single song and each band member plays his role absoutely perfectly.Even with all these great qualities,I only place Master third in the list of Metallica's best albums.Justice and Lightning do beat this one. <br />   It is still so good that nothing less than 5 stars will do for it!
B00005JO17|4.0|I took my four year old grandson to see this movie. He liked it.  I liked it.  It has enough action to keep a little one interested. It has enough interesting dialogue that I wasn't bored.  I think it was a good movie for young children.<br /><br />I do not support movies intended for kids which are mean spirited and violent. I would not recommend a movie for young children that had violence in it.  This movie was fine.  Watch it with your little ones and smile and sing.
B00005JOGU|5.0|On November 14, 1959 two men broke into a country home in a small Kansas town. If they were in search of something, that was vastly overshadowed by what they did. On that night so many years ago, the two men brutally murdered the family living there. Details of the four people murdered made their way into the New York Times and I am sure caught the attention of many. One man in particular was moved enough to want to write about it. He wanted to learn everything he could and write an article on how the town was reacting to this tragedy. After arriving in Kansas and talking to a few people, he realized there was too much material for an article. He would have to write a book. This movie tells Truman Capote's story as he researches and writes his novel In Cold Blood.  <br /> <br />Capote used the fame acquired from best-selling fiction novels, the name popularized from them, and his publisher's deep pockets to obtain unrestricted access to information and to the two men charged with the crime. From there he used his manipulative personality and his supercharged drive to write this book to pry into the lives of Richard Eugene Hickock and Perry Edward Smith; the convicted.  <br /> <br />At first glance, I had decided not to see Capote. My movie watcher-actor relationship with Philip Seymour Hoffman has never been strong. He has been in good movies (Almost Famous, Patch Adams), but I have never had much respect for his work in them. I have never seen any archive footage of Truman Capote, so I cannot speak to how well Hoffman played Capote. Trueness to the character aside, I was very impressed with Hoffman's performance. Too often I find his characters devoid of emotion. That may be the way they are written, but it comes across to me as attributed to Hoffman. As Truman Capote he felt, and he felt deeply. You may not like it, but you will feel along with him as you watch Capote.  <br /> <br />Clifton Collins Jr. is a name that I wish more people knew. In Capote Collins hasa very important role; he was cast as Perry Smith, the convicted young man to which Truman Capote devotes the most time. Based on the amount of on screen time he had, I hate to say that I thought it unfortunate that he had such a small role. When I say that, I mean that I am disappointed by how few speaking parts he had, but that was the nature of his character and the will of the makers of the movie. I think he has talent and decent potential. He has worked with big names earlier in his career, Samuel L. Jackson in 187 and Robert Redford in The Last Castle, but I think landing the role in Capote was his biggest step forward. Maybe after seeing Capote you will finally remember the name Clifton Collins, Jr. <br /> <br />Catherine Keener plays Capote's long time friend and research assistant Nell Harper Lee. That name may ring familiar, if it does it will be most likely from the book she wrote while she helped Truman Capote work on his. Her book was titled To Kill A Mockingbird. If you have seen Keener in other movies, you may know her as a strong willed, patient woman. This holds true in Capote as well.  <br /> <br />The movie really makes you want to like Truman Capote, it his Truman himself that fights to make you dislike him. As the protagonist watchers struggle with him to get information, but it is his choices of what to do with that information that causes conflict. What I learned from the movie Capote is that Truman Capote was a very self-absorbed man. Each and everything he did in his adult life appeared to be self-serving or not worth his time. You see the relationships he has developed. We get to know two the two people closest in his life, yet even their friendship is at his convenience. They see the good in him and wish to share it with him, but more often than not it seems to be buried beneath his own motives.  <br /> <br />This book was not a part of his life, rather it was his life as he wrote it and it left irreparable damage once this chapter in hislife was closed. It consumed him and you may take solace as it seems he does see the error in his ways at the end. Hindsight is 20/20, so they say. We are led to believe he could not forgive himself; it will be on a case by case basis whether we as viewers, now privy to the details, can forgive him.  <br /> <br />The movie was very graphic, so I do warn you about that, but if it is actually possible, I must say the graphic nature of Capote was done tastefully and it did serve a purpose. There was nothing gratuitous about it.  <br /> <br />I liked Capote very much. I love profound movies, and Capote certainly was that. I recommend you see this in the theater if you have the chance. If not, on DVD will have to suffice.
0783233477|5.0|This was the most intense movie I have ever seen! Wish in current life, that the grim reeper, would let our love ones have a few days to deal with their loveones.  It is amazing how they would act, the way they should have all along!  Very humbling!

0440241588|1.0|Grisham is now writing books for the sake of making his publisher happy. The Broker is awful. The plot starts off and the book seems like it is going somewhere. Eventually, it becomes a Berlitz book on the Italian language. The various countries send out their best \\"assassins\\" to kill the main character but they all fizzle out and are never heard from again near the end of the book. Why? This book is not even worth ONE star. Skip this book. Read his early stuff instead.
B000A0GP4K|4.0|This documentary was fantastic.  I have no qualms with it.  Rather, my problem lies with the extra DVD of 'performances.'  I thought, when I bought it, that I'd be able to watch entire filmed performances.  This is not the case - the 'performances' are simply the same clips from the documentary, not full performances.  So, this is false advertising.  Beware.
B000B0WODA|1.0|When major music publications such as Rolling Stone, Entertainment Weekly, and Blender all agree that a particular album or band is the next big thing, chances are they suck. Case in point--Franz Ferdinand. They should have just slapped a 'the' at the beginning of their name and an 's' at the end, because they're just as horrible as The White Stripes, The Hives, The Strokes, and the rest of those trendy alt rock bands. Franz Ferdinand is a perfect example of what is wrong with commercial rock music today.
B000AP2ZLC|5.0|This is one of the best of 2005, I cant get enough of the whole album.  its high quality shredding at its finest, with sufficient time changes and musical progressions for any metalhead with some musical knowledge themselves. Keeping the cadaver dogs busy & endless cemetary are my favorites, but not by much as the whole album is fantastic.  Not many bands take this kind of approach towards songwriting, but I love it, it makes the album epic rather than monotonous.  And I think Lord Worm sounds fine.
B000001FN1|5.0|What's the 4-1-1?<br /><br />Warlock started out in 1983 and released their first album Burning Witches a year later. The group was instantly compared to such heavy metal peers as Iron Maiden, Dio, Accept, and Judas Priest. In just four short years together, the group fronted by German vocalist Doro Pesch turned out four albums before calling it quits. Triumph and Agony was their final release together and it was probably their mot cohesive. The album starts off with the commanding rock anthem \\"All We Are\\". The groups doesn't hesitate to turn the energy and volume levels up to eleven as Doro belts out the resounding chorus with such power and melody.<br /><br />Furious vocals and hard-charging rhythms propel \\"Three Minute Warning\\" into a heavy metal meltdown. \\"I Rule the Ruins\\" is a play on words that really implies that Doro rules the bedroom. Who am I to argue with her? She's backed-up by some great chugga-chugga riffs and wailing guitar solos. \\"Make Time for Love\\" is a somber ballad that centers in on Pesch's vocal abilities. The addition of piano helps add to the emotional level. \\"East Meets West\\" could pass for a war charge anthem. Only Doro could make \\"Metal Tango\\" sound so cool with her assuring and convincing delivery.<br /><br />Warlock put the finally nail in their career with the ever-enduring ballad \\"Fur Immer\\". I have no clue what most of it means, but it sure is jarring and sad. That might have something to do with the warm strings and drum combination that makes up the music part of it. Doro Pesch went on to a successful solo career that continues to this day. I have no idea what happened to the rest of the group.<br /><br />The Verdict<br /><br />Warlock ended their partnership on a high note that left heavy metal fans with an instant classic.

B000BW7QWW|5.0|If your a fan of scifi, you'll love this movie and the series (Firefly).  Even with it's relatively small budget, this movie look and sounds great.  The cast is perfect the their roles.  I wish they would make sequels.
B000002VE7|3.0|I agree with the previous reviewer who claims this album has a tougher edge to it, but, while many may disagree, I hold that vulture culture, with its soft, melodic approach, suits the APP sound much better. There are too many tracks on here, I just do not like. <br />'Stereotomy' is an excellent opener and John Miles is exceptional. Anyone who does not know him, is directed to the 'rebel' album and the best of/anthology releases. He is a brilliant musician, whose ability is sadly overlooked. This track is multi-part and complex. Incidentally, there is a soft bridge near the end, beginning...'turn me to stone', which I adore, but I cannot think who sings this, could be Eric. (another amazing singer.) <br />Boujolais (or however you spell it) is Chris Rainbow's effort. He is also incredible, and his albums are all sadly out of print, as with Miles. But I find this track too shizophrenic sounding. I preferred his ballads for APP. <br />'Limelight' is an absolutely incredible tune, and one of the best in the APP catalogue. A beautiful melody. If one listens to 'Inside looking out', from Gaudi, I think the two tracks are similar. Check this out! <br />I really don't think much of the meandeering two instrumental tracks. 'In the real world' is a rocky, inconsequential track and 'light of the world' is a ballad of sorts, but for some reason is just not that memorable to me. <br />Tracks 1 and 4 are outstanding. But the rest is sub-standard to me.
B0009PM5ZY|1.0|As a collector of Led Zeppelin concerts, I can affirm this release is not official. It is a bootleg. I will not go into details about the quality of the concert and recording. This should not be offered for sale. If anyone is interested in Led Zeppelin concerts, please seek out traders. Many are willing to trade with new collectors for blank CD-R's and postage.
B0000X61UU|5.0|There is no denying that the lower body portion of the workout video works. My pecks are also getting very toned. She works a lot on the \\"wings\\" of my arms and that is definitely a plus. Although I am happy when it is over, I feel lost when I miss a day! If you aren't ready to feel the pain and soreness in the beginning this definitely isn't for you.. <br /> <br />
B00005NWM3|2.0|there are two tracks on this album i love but the rest to be honest to not spark the same creativity other than the last song there isnt anything that comes close how you remind me is a brilliant song and too bad is good as well but the rest are not on par when i got this album i was 11 and loved it and would of given in 5 stars on the dot but now im older (16) it just dosnt compare with bands like incubus system of a down and all the classics your probably better off buying the singles they do have better albums if dry grunge with course vocals that sound like sand paper are your thing then mayby the album would suit you but otherwise buy the singles
0142000663|5.0|Just finished the book.  I spent the first 1/3 of this book not very interested at all.  I appreciated Steinbeck's passages showing the workings of capitalism, but found the dialoge to be pretty artificial and, since so much of the book is dialogue, found reading it pretty grating.  About halfway throuh I was finally able to suspend disbelief and forgave the bad dialogue.  I suppose by then I was deep enough inside the world of the book that I was willing to accept the dialogue as real - like one might accept the dialogue in bible translations.  By this time, I was pretty interested in the story, but still not convinced I was reading a great book.  Good, not great.  This view continued until the last few paragraphs.  I don't know what more to say but the ending took my head off.  Wow.  Its almost an hour later and I'm still having brief fits of tears.  The ending was both devastating and inspiring.  For a writer to manage that is genius.<br /><br />Whatever you do, don't skip to the end.  Saving it will be so worth it.
0064407667|1.0|This is not a very good book.  The story is stupid, the characters are awful, and everything else about it is just weird.  I did not enjoy this at all and hope that I never have to read any bit of these books again.  Do not buy, do not get it out of the library, do not go near this book or any of them unless you wish to cause yourself great pain.  I would never get this as a gift unless you are shopping for someone you really hate.
B0001HAISG|5.0|Peter Pan, I imagine, is a difficult story to perform in any medium. The techinical aspects are one thing; but the complex story is another. It cannot be easy to produce something that vividly depicts a fantasic world where children can fly with faeries, that portrays sympathetic characters, and can entertain children and adults at the same time. This movie does all of these things.     Visually, every frame of Peter Pan looks like a color plate from a Victorian storybook. Peter's shadow dances and leaps; Tinker Bell has the energy and attitude of more than one human; there are snowstorms and thunderstorms and sunsets. We finally have the technology to make a proper Peter Pan movie, and this one makes full use of it.      But it's so much more than CGI effects. This has to be the most emotionally layered Pan film, if not children's film, ever made. The psychology of the children and the adults is develed into in a way that few movies can do without getting preachy. It's still the same never-grow-up story, but here we see Wendy as a child who is just about to succumb to the turmoil of adolescence. She and Peter, who are brilliantly portrayed by their respective actors, begin to discover romantic attraction through each other. During their time together in Neverland, Peter and Wendy go through what most people experience over at least a year-long committed relationship. Captain Hook points out to Peter that Wendy cannot stay with him if he won't grow up, and that's something that takes adults a while to realize. Meanwhile, Mr. Darling is trying to move up in society; Mrs. Darling doesn't pay enough attention to her kids; and the children's aunt is trying to make sure Wendy finds a suitable husband, which is something that she apparently did not accomplish in her own life. There are traces of Sigmund Freud in this retelling of the story, which does not make it \\"dirty\\" or unsuitable for children, but it gives the adults some things to think about. Wendy causes a scandalat school when she draws a picture in her notebook of a boy flying above her bed. Mr. Darling and Captain Hook are played by the same actor, which sets up the implication that Wendy and her brothers are essentially battling their own father. Even Hook and Tinker Bell have an odd flirtation of sorts. I don't want to make it sound disgusting or anything, but this Peter Pan brings up issues that other versions have only suggested.     The magic and romance are also punctuated with witty humor, like The Princess Bride or The Brothers Grimm. Smee never gets too much important but some of the best lines in the film are from his own dry observations. It is an incredible movie and it deserves to seen and owned.
0340823380|5.0|The Battle of Corrin is the final installment of a trilogy, a prequel of sorts ostensibly based on the notes and writings of Frank Herbert. For those of you that don't know, trilogy takes place ten thousand years before the time of originator Frank Herbert's immensely popular book, Dune. It is a collaboration between Brian Herbert (Frank's son) and Kevin Anderson. It is the sixth book co-written by these authors that I know of, having just finished another trilogy/prequel, The House series (House Atriedes, Harkonnen and Corrin).<br /><br />Unlike some other reviewers, I found this trilogy to be exceptional. I believe they may be Herbert/Anderson's most accomplished manuscripts. I finally got to experience the distant past, which was vaguely alluded to in Herbert's original Dune series. We get to meet the beautiful, compassionate Serena Butler, who's young son, the murder of which, set off the rebellion, which eventually after sixty-five years brought down the heartless thinking machines. We also meet distant relatives of Baron Harkonnen - Xavier (who is a good and honorable person) then Abulurd and Paul Atriedes - Vorian (the son of the wicked Titan, Agamemnon {a thousand year old human brain in a robot body})and Tio Holtzman (the revered inventor of the Holtzman Effect and other inventions). We experience the last stronghold of free humanity, with The League of Nobles, the fledgling exportation of the spice melange from Arrakis and the precursor of the Bene Gesserit, in the Sorceress's of Rossak. In the final story the pieces start to come together that were the basis for Dune some ten thousand years later as the groundwork is laid for the Harkonnen/Atriedes feud as well as the space guild and mentats<br /><br />As with the original Dune, the authors create numerous civilizations in a Universe dwelling on millions of planets and then embellish it with devious evil characters and their requisite counterpoints. It may be ten thousand years in the past from Dune but they are every bit as advanced to us, as we are to Cro Magnon Man.<br /><br />Conclusion<br /><br />Personally, I cannot understand why so many readers want to burn this series at the stake. I found this book, consisting of 704 pages, to be an riveting read. True, the chapters are numerous and short but the story is ambitious so it couldn't be overly detailed, or the book would have been unwieldy. We are, after all, talking about a Universal Epic in which the authors followed about fifteen main characters on six different planets and in space. As with Dune we are treated to an excellent page turning science fiction novel with religious undertones.<br /><br />As a reader it seems to be in vogue to criticize this trilogy. As a writer I can tell you that these authors did a wonderful job of juggling this very complex story and telling the story without being confusing and finally closing an open chapter of the Dune Saga. Personally I am in awe of their accomplishment.<br /><br />I suggest that you read this with an open mind and don't pre judge these books. No, it's not as good as Dune but neither were the elder Herbert's following works. The bottom line is this is a good piece of science fiction in this day when Fantasy has taken over the genre.ut they are every bit as advanced to us, as we are to Cro Magnon Man. <br /> <br />Conclusion <br /> <br />Personally, I cannot understand why so many readers want to burn this series at the stake.

B0009R1T7M|2.0|I consider Illinois by Sufjan Stevens to be the most overrated hipster album of the year.  I swear, nothing on this album sticks out whatsoever.  I must have listened to this thing a dozen times and nothing clicked.  It sounds like a whiny singer songwriter who is going out of his way to be different by playing with a band that sounds like a high school orchestra.   <br /> <br />I like the idea about doing an album for every state, but the music doesn't hold up to such an ambitious idea.  Sufjan Stevens and this album seem to a product of hype and reviews from sources like Pitchfork and Mojo who pressumably have indie cred.  So to sum up, avoid this, even if listening to it makes you hip with the coffee shop crowd.
B0002234LS|1.0|I rented this movie and it was just awful. The plot was predictable, and the twist at the end has been done countless times in other movies. Not worth buying.
B0006VU3ZA|1.0|WARNING: I have two copies of this CD and they both contain an audible \\"glitch\\" during the song \\"Set The Controls For The Heart Of The Sun\\"... which makes me wonder... is this a fake CD with EMI labels on the cover, intended to look official (it's hard to imagine EMI releasing something with such a clear sonic deficiancy).  <br /> <br />Furthermore, the recording level of \\"Animals\\" is much much lower than that of \\"Saucerful Of Secrets\\", which is a great deal louder (it makes you jump out of your seat when one album closes and the second one begins...!!). Anyone else agree....??
0689853637|5.0|This is truly the most beautiful book that I have ever seen - and it's for kids! Each page is gorgeous, the story is simple enough for the little guys, and the house lights on the last page really are amazing. Only one thing...there should be instructions about pulling the tab off the back in order for the house to light. I got this information from a customer review, so I was all set, but it would have been a problem otherwise. A most wonderful gift.
0679422714|2.0|After reading this book, i'm beginning to think that if someone has suffered under a dictator then maybe they shouldn't write a biography about that dictator. This book is written by that same woman who wrote Wild Swans. For those who haven't read that book. It follow three generations of women in Chang's family her grandmother, mother and herself. It was a very interesting memoir about living before Mao , during his rise to power and the tale end of his reign. The Chang family suffered under Mao's domination. A lot of people suffered under Mao's domination. Chang set out to write an unflattering biography but in doing so whatever valid evidence she has is complete overshadowed by her own hate of Mao. Her anger comes through every page of the biography. Mao was not a nice person. The Gang of four committed atrocities that would have made Stalin proud but because of the tone and language of the writing, Chang's version will be dismissed as spite. I recommend approaching this book with caution. Only read this book after you have read a more balanced biography to get Mao's background and the facts straight. Then go read Wild Swans to find out where Chang is coming from. Then read this one with a grain of salt. I believe that Chang fears that Mao is being romanticized as time progresses further away from his reign and she wants to make sure that the world never forgets but she's over doing it.
B000089CJI|4.0|The Postal Service comprises Ben Gibbard (of my favorite - once was - indie band, Death Cab for Cutie) and Jimmy Tamborello of Dntel. As you could expect from any DCFC production, Ben adds his thought provoking lyrics, colorful melodies and creative guitar riffs to music that is ATARI-esque electronic and almost \\"drum and bass\\" like (I think he wrote the drum tracks as well). The songs are very musical, but haunting and a little somber sounding. Violins and female vocals (have no idea who she is) helps give the songs added dimension.    I'm not sure who I would recommend this to - perhaps those who like Indie AND electronic music and maybe that musician who needs a little inspiration.
068485743X|5.0|Adapted from my February 2005 B&N review: <br /> <br />Noah Lukeman's 'The First Five Pages' taught me many new insights on the process of writing. The title is a bit of a misnomer, since 'The First 5 Pages' covers every major aspect of writing in a lively and indepth prose style. And yet, Mr. Lukeman does demonstrate how transgressing a number of major writing principles at the beginning of one's novel can derail one's goal of getting published. One of Mr. Lukeman's key insights is a warning to young writers not to plunge into dialogue without first grounding the reader in a specific setting. Despite such instruction, Mr. Lukeman caveats his advice often, demonstrating via specific examples that the proferred 'writing principles' are guiding advice to the general reader, and are occasionally circumvented by experienced masterful authors. The real strength of 'The First 5 Pages' are the writing examples Mr. Lukeman includes to demonstrate each and every writing principle he teaches. In each of his 19 chapters, Mr. Lukeman not only teaches you how to correctly handle 'style' or 'tone' or 'pacing and progression,' etc., but also demonstrates what the major problems are in these writing areas (with specific examples for each kind of problem) and how to fix each individual problem. His 'solutions' sections at the end of every chapter contain detailed guidance, as well as splendid writing exercises readers are to employ in improving their own creative efforts. I have read hundreds of books on writing, and must confess my amazement that Mr. Lukeman masterfully taught me so many new things. I recently purchased Mr. Lukeman's THE PLOT THICKENS, and look forward to the publication of his next books.

0425163407|5.0|Virginia's chief medical examiner, Kay Scarpetta, is trapped in a nightmare of unsolved murders and a pernicious virus in this breathless thriller, where clues are elusive and the killer's threats are hurled through cyberspace.<br /><br />Dr. Kay Scarpetta is newly returned from Dublin, where she was called in to examine the remains of a murder victim whose limbs and head were expertly severed--a signature of a cunning serial killer on the loose again after an eight-year sabbatical--when the same killer apparently strikes again, this time much closer to home to Scarpetta. The remains of a woman are found in a Virginia landfill, her body dismembered in the same expert way as in the Dublin case. After Scarpetta investigates the murder scene, the killer boldly contacts her through the Internet, inviting her to download photos of the murder victim and signing off with a chilling screen name: deadoc.<br /><br />Scarpetta soon discovers inconsistencies between this new case and the serial murders she has been investigating. With the help of her niece, Lucy, and FBI computer expert, she takes an extraordinary virtual tour of the background of the e-mailed photo. But even as Scarpetta and Lucy probe illuminating details in virtual relaity, local authorities try to wrap up the case by charging the man who discovered the body. When Scarpetta determines that the victim was exposed to a rare smallpox-like virus before she died and, later, that herself may have been infected, she realizes that she is up against a killer with access to an incredible sophisticated arsenal of deadly force--a killer with a specific animus directed toward her.<br /><br />Packed with unrelieved tension and constant surprises, Unnatural Exposure is the case of Kay Scarpetta's life--and a triumph for Patrica Cornwell.<br /><br />I loved this book because of the high tension throughout and the attention paid to forensic details. Cornwell is defintely an author who just seems to get better and better.
B000BTJDGC|3.0|More a psychological horro-drama, the film does deliver several \\"creepy\\" scares. The scenes that most disturbed me were of the dark shadow man following the priest. All the Emily stuff was essentially a clone of The Exorcist, which over 30 years later, still sets the standard for these clones.

B000BMSTMS|4.0|For all the other reviews I must say, smell what your shoveling, this is the direction that band less 1 guitar player is taking. I must say this is just as heavy as anything else they have done, perhaps not as dark but a welcome change being that. I have to admit the songs where Atticus Ross is added to the production may have a more industrial edge, this more of a natural progression that i always thought the band could take, it sounds just as i assumed it might. I like the flavor of Johns' vocal arrangements and the time changes. <br /> <br />This is over all a great change of pace from Take a look in the mirror album which i do agree was more of trying for the first shot out the door of their self titled album. Don't take me wrong it was a great album but this album has more lasting verses and choruses(did i spell that right). Truely a inspriring release! Nice change from the last few efforts.
B00078XGRO|4.0|After all, with the Borg, how can you go wrong?<br /><br />The ILM effects are terrific, the performances by James Cromwell, Alice Krige (sp?) and Alfie Woodard are top notch .<br /><br />The best things about this film is Picard trying to control his lust for revenge, and Data being tempted by the human flesh he is given by the Borg queen!<br /><br />The plot is unique, and the action is varied.<br /><br />Alas, there are some problems...<br /><br />The early starship battle scene is too short, and the destruction of the Borg cube is too easy!!<br /><br />Some of the humor falls on it's face... like when Picard and Data are touching the starship \\"Pheonix,\\" Troi asks them if the \\"three of  them\\" would \\"like to be alone.\\"  later on, Troi plays intoxicated well, but it just ends up being silly. And Picard's line \\"rumors of my assimilation have been greatly exagerated...\\" made me groan out loud.<br /><br />And finally, the Borg Queen is too human like! Her behavior is emotional and tempermental. The scariest thing about the Borg as a race is their dispassionate, cold and mechanical motivations... and here their leader acts like some reject from \\"Desperate Housewives.\\"<br /><br />And the \\"time travel\\" plot has a hole. If the Borg can time travel at the push of a button, why don't they try to assimilate Earth in the past... over, and over, and over again? With that type of power, the entire Universe should be \\"assimilated.\\"<br /><br />Despite these problems, this film is the most consistent of the Next Gen films and is thoroughly enjoyable!<br /><br />Jeff Messenger, author of the novel \\"the Shroud of Torrington.\\"
B000BQ7D9E|4.0|Diane Lane and John Cusack are like the couple from When Harry Met Sally and Alex and Emma.  Diane Lane was like Meg Ryan and John Cusack is like Billy Crystal in the movie.  Diane Lane is nice and oppionated girl and John Cusack is the lovable laid back guy.  Diane Lane has the greatest resemblance of Academy Award winner Grace Kelly, Michelle Pfeiffer and E.R. Sherry Stringfield.  What is Diane Lane secret, she looks like she was ninteen or twenty than forty.  I never thought she look forty. if she was in a nightclub people thought she was sixteen or seventeen.  I bet when her daughter looks at her, people thought if she was her sister not her mother.  Diane Lane was on Desparate Housewives, I think she would have played Edie Britt if she was on.

B000002UB3|5.0|This album is the Beatles at their Best, its so hard to choose the best beatles album because each one was fabulous. What makes them so great is that most huge bands usually only have one or two great members like U2 with Bono&the Edge or Rolling stones with Mick Jagger, or Led Zeppelin with Jimi Page&John Bonham. But with the Beatles all four are spectacular, all four sing, play, and write. John Lennon is no doubtebly the best singer/songwriter ever, Paul McCartney is the next for that and Bass playing, George Harrison is that and Guitar Playing, and Ringo...Well Ringo may not be the best drummer, but he can sing and write very well and he has a drum solo on this album that rocks.  <br /> <br />Come Together (Lennon) 100/10 Opener for the album that just plain rocks a Jazzy Bass line, Lennon Singing, famous chorus. what could be better? <br /> <br />Something (Harrison) 10/10 Beautiful Guitar piece. <br /> <br />Maxwells Silver hammer (McCartney) 8/10 Paul sings about a mass murder and turns it into a fun song <br /> <br />Oh Darling (Mcartney) 9/10 old school rock song that just plain rocks <br /> <br />Octopus Garden (RINGO) 10/10 brings you back to yellow submarine almost, just a great song <br /> <br />I want you (Lennon) 10/10 one of the longest and best the Beatles ever did. <br /> <br />here comes the sun (Harrison) 10/10 many regard this as Harrisons best song, not my opinion, but it is very good <br /> <br />Because (Lennon) 10/10 another Great one, The Harpsichord is great in it <br /> <br />you never give me your money (McCartney) 10/10 nonthin to say but that it is great <br /> <br />Sun King (Lennon) 5/10 worst song on the album  <br /> <br />Mean MR Mustard (Lennon) HAHA i love this song a distorted bass Lennons fun sing-along lyrics and just plain greatness <br /> <br />Polythene Pam (Lennon) 10/10 same as Mr Mustard without the Distorted bass, pure genious <br /> <br />she came....bathroom window (McCartney) 8/10 but of a weird intro but who cares <br /> <br />Golden Slumbers (McCartney) 10/10 Yet another great one <br /> <br />Carry That Weight (McCartney) 10/10 great chorus line and intro with them all singing <br /> <br />The End (McCartney) 10/10 so many solos guitars, drums, vocals. it upsets me though that paul didn't throw in a bass solo though. still rocks though <br /> <br />here majesty (McCartny) 8/10 fun....but pointless (hidden trak)
B00011RPB0|5.0|What a great idea for a movie - a little quirky, but \\"normal\\" enough to hit close to home, at least for those of us who have ended up in a strange place and wondered about the larger things in life.  The cast does a fantastic job - Murray probably will never be better.  Great direction.  Interesting storyline.  Great all around!
B0007GAEW6|5.0|First of all, you mostly either love the Mars Volta or you hate them, but I happen to be one of the people that are obsessed with them.  I can't blame some people for disliking the material on this album; on my first listen I was very frustrated with the long passages of inaudible noise and the spacy sections that seemed to drag on in between songs.  Although this all might be overwhelming at first, I guarantee that this album will grow on you.  As some other reviews have said, if you're trying to get into TMV, but can't seem to handle Frances the Mute yet, their first album is just as amazing, and it has a little more structure to it.  Anyway, on Frances the Mute, the things that impressed me most were the lightning fast drumming, the almost Jimmy Page-esque guitar, its overall originality, and, most of all, the diverse and creative musical infuences on the songs themselves (Latin, Jazz, Rock, etc.) If you're tired of the mainstream, uninspired crap on MTV these days, you won't regret giving the Mars Volta a listen or two.
B000AADYRQ|4.0|DCFC makes the jump to a major label... and loses something in the process.  Perhaps, like REM, they will eventually become a great mainstream band (it took REM a while, after many fantastic albums as an indie band).  Or maybe they will fade into pop music mediocrity while making tons of money.  However, this is not a complete loss.  There are great moments on this album, and of course soul meets body is hard to not get hooked on.  In the meantime, check out Transatlanticism and We Have the Facts... and cross your fingers that this very worthy band will not get the essence smashed out of it by the pop establishment.  Worth a buy.
B000B7BRMM|1.0|When do you know you are not the best at what you do? I guess we can't help what our talent level is and just plunge forward. Most of us have no choice and do the best we can and hope no one notices. If however, you are Diana Krall, and decide to record a Christmas CD, you're meiocrity is out there for all to hear. <br /> <br />This CD is almost excruiatingly bad. How Amazon reviewers can rate this four or five stars is beyond me. What does this say about the rest of their Christmas CD collections? By this time, most of us have separated the wheat from the chaff on Christmas music. The Diana Krall CD lands directly on the chaff. The first cut of Jingle Bells is so amatuerish, I could barely finish listening to it. At the end she rewards us with a Sinatra throw away line that was a real groaner. What did the guys in the band think about this? As for the scat, well, I hope Mel and Ella didn't get wind of it. Their legends are intact. <br />Count your Blessings had a chance, but you know, if you can't add anything to the penultimate recording of a tune (in this case it would be The Swingle Singers version), it's best to lay off. That is why people do not record Take Five(Brubeck/Desmond) very often or San Francisco(Bennett), or Misty (Garner). CYB like every song on this CD never lit anything up. Her intentionsl (?) slurring of words and phrases to summon up mood only results in giving the impression of someone trying to swing or stylize the music and failing. Performances like this are why I will not watch American Idol. Why subject yourself to bad perfomaces? On purpose? <br /> <br />Diana Krall tries to reinvent the Julie London/Peggy Lee style and unfortunately she gets a C- for her efforts. If you're going to imitate the masters, you can't fall this short.
B00004RFFS|5.0|Interview With The Vampire with Tom Cruise and Brad Pitt deliver erotic tale of two vampires that live in New Orleans and one trys to take over and control of the people and the other still trying to figure out his new life as a vampire....

I think that Tom and Brad do a wonderful job in this erotic sexy vampire movie and i do have to say that this movie is one of my favorite vampire movies that is out now!!!!!!
B000B7BRMM|2.0|Wow. The power of popular image is amazing. Once a star gets a certain amount of momentum going, people slurp up whatever they crank out. As long as the name and picture are on the cover...<br /><br />I'm a jazz fan for sure, and I like most of what Diana does---but on this one, she sounds like someone woke her from a sound sleep and thrust a mic in her face.<br /><br />At first I thought, \\"Okay, she's just laid-back.\\" But it goes on and on. Is she apathetic about Christmas? Is this material too technically demanding for her? (Most Christmas tunes are easy to sing, but hard to sing well.) Possibly both.<br /><br />I suspect that she didn't want to do a Christmas album. (After all, you can dress up Christmas songs with swinging arrangements, but they're not jazz---they're pop, and the point of being a jazz musician is to transcend pop pap.) So her handlers would have convinced her to make this stylistic concession---everyone knew it'd be a big seller---and she'd do it, unenthusiastically.<br /><br />Maybe she was so concerned about her jazz image, she felt compelled to lay irony into each song, as if to say, \\"Yeah, okay, I'm doing Christmas tunes, but I know how un-hip they are.\\"<br /><br />Nat \\"King\\" Cole was a superb jazz pianist. Like Diana, he didn't start singing till his handlers convinced him it would multiply his sales. And like Diana, he wasn't an especially technically-proficient singer. But whatever he sang---including a famous album of Christmas tunes---he sang from his heart.<br /><br />Maybe it's just me, but I don't hear any heart in this album. I hear someone who's waiting for it to be over.<br /><br />The band is great.
0440236738|5.0|This book was exciting from beginning to end.  Very intense non stop action and plot twists exist throughout this book.  On her deathbed, the narrator's mom tells her son that her brother is alive.  Will Klein, the book's narrator, is out to find the truth about his older brother, Ken, who is on the run from the police for murdering Will's ex-girlfriend.  Also, his fiancee, Sheila Rogers, mysteriously disappears right after the funeral of his mother. One of the more interesting characters in this book is Will's best friend, Squares, a former skinhead who made good who works as a Yoga instructor.  He also works at the Covenant House with Will in an effort to get runaways off the street.     This book was very well written and I've made every effort to find flaws with it.  I couldn't.
B0009S4IHY|5.0|Review for the original 2005 DVD release:<br /><br />  The main thing I learned from this movie is to always watch<br />your side view blade for oncoming landladies.<br /><br />  \\"Handles?!? Who's throwing handles?\\" - That whole sequence<br />was comedic genius. It made me laugh so much, I had to stop the movie<br />to catch my breath.<br /><br />  Made me an instant Stephen Chow fan.<br /><br />p.s. Anyone who watched the film with just the subtitles OR<br />  dubbing enabled should watch it again with BOTH subtitles<br />  and dubbing on. There's some humorous differences between<br />  the two.<br /><br />***2009 Notes on the 2007 \\"Axe-Kickin\\" Edition***<br /><br />I still love this movie, and recently came across a 2007 reissue called<br />the \\"Axe Kickin' Edition\\". I bought it because it was only four bucks and<br />the jacket touted all-new features, including \\"Never-Before See Footage from<br />the Hong Kong Version\\".<br /><br />If you have the original 2005 release, hang onto it -this newer version isn't as<br />good - both versions have the same run time -there is no additional footage<br />in the 2007 reissue.<br /><br />The difference movie-wise is the 2007 has more graphic blood effects:<br /><br />- When the Landlord falls from the balcony and then hits the pavement, a<br />trickle of blood runs from his head up the pavement.<br /><br />- When the \\"Cattle Raising\\" woman punches Stephen Chow after he challenges<br />her, she gets sprayed with Stephen Chow's blood.<br /><br />- More blood effects when the Beast first beats up Stephen Chow.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I think the additional blood takes away from the slapstick feel<br />of these scenes, making them more violent/less funny (maybe the original DVD<br />release was cleaned up for this reason).<br /><br />The new extras are pretty much run-of-the-mill movie prodution featurettes. The<br />special features on the original DVD release were more entertaining.<br /><br />So if you haven't seen this movie, try to get the 2005 release. If you own the<br />2005 edition and are a fan, there's nothing earth-shattering in the 2007<br />\\"Axe-Kickin' Edition\\" that makes it a must buy.<br /><br />Still, this is a classic comedic movie, either way!it a must buy.    Still, this is a classic comedic movie, either way!
B00001O2GN|4.0|This \\"Robobox\\" is not the MGM version reviewed below. It doesn't have any of the extras, it's just the movies. Still great movies, though!
B0000CBHOI|3.0|Please see the other reviews which adequately sum up the contents of these films. I won't spend my time on that. <br /> <br />What I will do is describe my viewing experience, which was profound joy and glee at seeing the vintage performance footage, followed by dismay and confusion as each filmmaker interjected annoying Voice-Overs, dramatic re-creations, and other material that completely detracted from the significance of what was being shown, even as they attempted to emphasize it.  <br /> <br />For example, the \\"Soul of a Man\\" video (horrid, horrid title, by the way) concludes with an unbelievable performance of the song \\"Crow Jane\\" by Skip James, which was culled from a Dutch television performance not long before his death. It is gripping and enthralling. I almost don't have words to describe it. I would buy the DVD for that performance alone. <br /> <br />Now picture that epic performance followed by some cheap CGI graphic of outer space, with the Voyager spacecraft floating by, (I'm not kidding) and Lawrence Fishburn giving a heavy handed narration that sounds like a seventh-grader's book report:  \\"These Blues artists have a place in history, even though they died a poor man's death ... blah blah blah\\" -- NO KIDDING!!??!! Just let me watch the vintage footage of Son House already, and SHUT UP! <br /> <br />I was very interested also in the DVD \\"special features\\" but they turned out to be just another basket of frustration. I clicked on the \\"Songs from the Movie\\" link, hoping to have UN-CUT renditions of the songs featured in the film. Would that have been too hard?!?!  Apparently so. Instead, you get treated to the 30-second snippet of the hacked-up songs *exactly* as they appear in the film. Thanks for nothing, idiots. But hey, you can read all about the director's filmography and hear his commentary all day long (who cares!). <br /> <br />Also the footage of other musicians covering the classic tunes was a waste of time. Showing something like John Mayall's \\"Death of J.B. Lenoir\\" is completely appropriate, and integral to the story (so naturally that homage gets short shrift). Yet some \\"alternative\\" artist gets scads of screen time to do a punk rendition of a classic -- it's a crime to even include that kind of crud on these discs. OK, it's a tribute. OK, \\"Today's artists still draw influence from these Blues Masters\\" -- every person with an ounce of musical knowledge knows that already. It's a MOOT POINT. I can go to the record store and get 45 Bonnie Raitt albums and watch her on VH-1. Enough, already! <br /> <br />If anything this set of films is interesting as a Blues primer and a container of precious gems that are scattered throughout so much junk filmmaking. I'd suggest you check this set out from the local library and watch them, before deciding if it's something you want to own. It will definitely give you a jones to look up more vintage films and recordings.  <br /> <br />Ken Burns would have done this project sooo much more justice. I wish Scorsese would just open up his vault of vintage recordings and release this stuff un-edited and raw. It would've been better that way.
B0000AZAUM|5.0|The Rise And Fall Of Ziggy Stardust And The Spiders From Mars (1972.), David Bowie's fifth studio album<br /><br />As the 1970's progressed, David Bowie became recognised as a music legend. However, in the early part of his career, Bowie was much less known and hadn't yet broken through into the mainstream, even though he'd released classic albums such as 'Hunky Dory'. This all changed in 1972 with the release of the 'Ziggy Stardust' concept album. David Bowie's newly adopted persona in the album transformed him into a famous star overnight. Over time, David Bowie's glam rock styled 'Ziggy Stardust' has been hailed as his ultra-definitive album and perhaps as his greatest. So does 'Ziggy Stardust' live up to its great reputation?<br /><br />'Ziggy Stardust' is unlike any other album I've heard. Even though the style is totally glam rock, a trend which was very popular in music in the early 70's, the concept around the album and the whole transformation Bowie made himself within the work is what makes it pretty unique. The concept of the album aside, all of the tracks on the album hold up individually in their own right. There are plenty of great concept albums such as 'The Wall' by Pink Floyd or 'Tommy' by The Who which require you to listen to the album as a whole to 'get' all of the tracks in context; with 'Ziggy Stardust', there is no such problem and all of the songs can be well appreciated as unrelated songs. This is why plenty of the songs, such as 'Starman' and 'Suffragette City' achieved popular status and plenty of radio play. Bowie and his backing band capture the glam style brilliantly. Mick Ronson is one of the main stars of the album with some legendary inspired solos plus the piano intertwines on some of the songs are played by him. The music on the album has a crisp and fresh sound to it and hasn't aged at all. You can tell the music is 70's glam but at the same time it never sounds dated.<br /><br />In the past ten or fifteen or so years, the David Bowie album series has undergone a number of remasters. The first of these was the 1990 remaster series which features the original 11 track album and bonus tracks including songs 'Velvet Goldmine' and the single 'John I'm Only Dancing'. Since then, an enhanced series of Bowie albums has become available and this is the version you're most likely to find on the CD shop shelf. These new versions have awesome sound quality for the original albums and come with well constructed booklets of lyrics however the enhanced CD's have no bonus tracks featuring like the earlier version. This is a shame because the remasters are excellent and it seems strange that they miss off extras that feature on an earlier version!<br /><br />The album is the epic saga of a space rock stars ascent to superstardom and his subsequent fall. 'Five Years' gets the album going; a footstep sounding drum opening leads into a great piano driven song. Bowie gives a pleading vocal performance about the end of the world drawing near. The orchestral background and whirlwind finish is classic. The glam style then truly kicks in with 'Soul Love'. This is one of the really catchy songs off the album, with some great driving guitar work from Mick Ronson and a great saxophone interlude. Bowie is a more than capable saxophone player and it is probably his most underrated musical ability. 'Moonage Daydream' for me is the height of this great album. This spacey sounding song rocks in great style. Epic, moody choruses contrasted by punchy verses make this song great and Mick Ronsons futuristic sounding exit solo is phenominal. 'Starman', another one of Bowie's most famous songs follows. This is another great, catchy song with a space theme. To finish the first side of the album is 'It Ain't Easy'. A good song, although probably the weakest on the album - ironically Bowie didn't write this one! The song has a killer chorus with wailing guitars.<br /><br />'Lady Stardust' then 'Star' open up the second half of thealbum. Both songs are great glam rocking songs; 'Lady Stardust' is especially great with a great piano melody carrying the tune. Another famous track, 'Hang On To Yourself' is next. This is a great fast paced song with a great guitar riff and inspired 'C'mon C'mon' chorus. Then, who could forget the opening guitar sequence of 'Ziggy Stardust'. Bowie sings the story of the rise and fall of the rock n' roll star; another one of the albums highlights. 'Suffragette City' follows; another classic glam sounding song with a driving riff and a really cool chorus. However, after all of these pretty upbeat songs, the album closes on a more mellow and darker note in the 'Rock n' Roll Suicide'. Lyrically brilliant, this acoustic starting song builds to an emphatic climax before finishing with the grand sound of a string orchestra.<br /><br />The 'Ziggy Stardust' album immortalised David Bowie. This, coupled with his famous 'Ziggy Stardust' tour which followed are some of the highlights of his great career. This album is up there with his other great works such as 'Hunky Dory' and 'Aladdin Sane'. Bowie's glam rock phase was perhaps his most successful era and this masterpiece has it all. If your looking to start a Bowie album collection, this is the work to begin with.<br /><br />MY RATING: 9.5/10g songs; 'Lady Stardust' is especially great with a great piano melody carrying the tune.

B000000W5N|5.0|The thing to know about \\"Sticky Fingers\\" is that all the songs on it are well written and sound great, of course you know \\"Brown Sugar\\" and \\"Wild Horses\\", but there are some special treats here too: \\"Dead Flowers\\" which is a great country and western song with Mick Jagger giving a classic London-Southern drawl performance, \\"Can't You Hear Me Knocking\\" has a lively jam that is unusual for a Stones record, \\"I Got the Blues\\" which has a sweet tune and is very very intense, and \\"Sister Morphine\\" which is a powerful tune that sounds like a plea for help (I understand this was a bad time for some in terms of heroin).  This is a great great album that you should own.  The sound is sharp and clear and the bands plays up to what is expected of them as the greatest of all rock and rollers.

The first of these was the 1990 remaster series which features the original 11 track album and bonus tracks including songs 'Velvet Goldmine' and the single 'John I'm Only Dancing'. Since then, an enhanced series of Bowie albums has become available and this is the version you're most likely to find on the CD shop shelf. These new versions have awesome sound quality for the original albums and come with well constructed booklets of lyrics however the enhanced CD's have no bonus tracks featuring like the earlier version. This is a shame because the remasters are excellent and it seems strange that they miss off extras that feature on an earlier version!<br /><br />The album is the epic saga of a space rock stars ascent to superstardom and his subsequent fall. 'Five Years' gets the album going; a footstep sounding drum opening leads into a great piano driven song. Bowie gives a pleading vocal performance about the end of the world drawing near. The orchestral background and whirlwind finish is classic. The glam style then truly kicks in with 'Soul Love'. This is one of the really catchy songs off the album, with some great driving guitar work from Mick Ronson and a great saxophone interlude. Bowie is a more than capable saxophone player and it is probably his most underrated musical ability. 'Moonage Daydream' for me is the height of this great album. This spacey sounding song rocks in great style. Epic, moody choruses contrasted by punchy verses make this song great and Mick Ronsons futuristic sounding exit solo is phenominal. 'Starman', another one of Bowie's most famous songs follows. This is another great, catchy song with a space theme. To finish the first side of the album is 'It Ain't Easy'. A good song, although probably the weakest on the album - ironically Bowie didn't write this one! The song has a killer chorus with wailing guitars.<br /><br />'Lady Stardust' then 'Star' open up the second half of thealbum. Both songs are great glam rocking songs; 'Lady Stardust' is especially great with a great piano melody carrying the tune. Another famous track, 'Hang On To Yourself' is next. This is a great fast paced song with a great guitar riff and inspired 'C'mon C'mon' chorus. Then, who could forget the opening guitar sequence of 'Ziggy Stardust'. Bowie sings the story of the rise and fall of the rock n' roll star; another one of the albums highlights. 'Suffragette City' follows; another classic glam sounding song with a driving riff and a really cool chorus. However, after all of these pretty upbeat songs, the album closes on a more mellow and darker note in the 'Rock n' Roll Suicide'. Lyrically brilliant, this acoustic starting song builds to an emphatic climax before finishing with the grand sound of a string orchestra.<br /><br />The 'Ziggy Stardust' album immortalised David Bowie. This, coupled with his famous 'Ziggy Stardust' tour which followed are some of the highlights of his great career. This album is up there with his other great works such as 'Hunky Dory' and 'Aladdin Sane'. Bowie's glam rock phase was perhaps his most successful era and this masterpiece has it all. If your looking to start a Bowie album collection, this is the work to begin with.<br /><br />MY RATING: 9.5/10g songs; 'Lady Stardust' is especially great with a great piano melody carrying the tune.

B000BW7QWW|4.0|For Non-Fans: <br /> <br />Though it's not essential that you see the series FIREFLY before you watch this movie, I would HIGHLY, HIGHLY, HIGHLY recommend it because it will enrich your experience of it ten-fold. These 9 crew members function in very specific ways for very specific reasons, both as individuals and as a group. Though the movie does do an admirable job of giving you the \\"crash course\\" in roll-call, nothing can replace the experience of getting to know and love each and every one of these characters one episode at a time. Those of us who saw this movie having already seen the TV show went in with great affection and genuine concern for the fate of its characters. Were it up to me, no one would be permitted to see this without first seeing the show. Rent it, buy it, borrow it... However you get your hands on it (notice I didn't say steal it), it's worth the time and the money. The reviews of FIREFLY on this website alone can attest to that. <br /> <br />Those of you that have seen and enjoyed the TV show have most likely already seen this movie, so I won't take up anyone's time by comparing the two. There's no shortage of websites debating this issue already. <br /> <br />For fans: <br /> <br />SPECIFIC TO THIS DVD <br /> <br />The introduction by Joss Whedon, for those of us who couldn't make it to the pre-screenings, is particularly touching and immediately reminds the fans exactly why we love these people. <br /> <br />The commentary... I was annoyed to the point of being nearly angry. Perhaps I just haven't learned yet what to expect from a dvd commentary. I wanted to hear why Joss made specific character choices and different plot-related explanations. The cupboard was all but bare. If you want to know what kind of light or camera lens was used, this commentary is for you. If you want to know anything about character development or to hear Joss comment on the significance of what's happening in a given scene, you will most likely be sorely disappointed. Practically none of the issues on which the fans would want to hear comments were discussed. The significance of a certain pilot was skimmed over at best. I was horribly disappointed and would have expected far more. <br /> <br />The features are pleasant enough and the extended scenes are well worth watching. As a fan, I'm obviously happy to own this movie. My only true disappointment is the commentary. <br />
B000002H2H|5.0|Ride The Lightning (1984.), Metallica's second studio album<br /><br />The 1980's were undoubtedly the age of heavy metal. One of the genre defining bands of the decade was Metallica. Taking the heaviness of bands like Iron Maiden and combining it with  intense speeds, Metallica were one of the bands to pioneer the genre we all know as thrash metal. The American band released their raw and aggressive first album, 'Kill E'm All' in 1983 however the band still needed a major record deal. Finally, they were noticed by Elektra Records and this album, 'Ride The Lightning' became their first major label release...<br /><br />... and what a major label debut it has proven to be! 'Ride The Lightning' is a masterpiece showcase of raw energy and intensity. The album is the best part of 50 minutes long and it doesn't hardly let up one bit. It's not hard to see why many Metallica fans hail this album as the band's best work. The album has raw qualities like its predecessor but at the same time, the song writing is awesome. The album is full of captivating guitar solos/melodies and grinding riffs that never for a moment loose interest plus at the same time, the music is played often at breakneck speeds! With all this, it is an album where with more and more listens, the work becomes more and more jaw dropping as you appreciate the phenominal and complex musicianship on the album. It is true to say there are some downsides to the album; James Hetfield hasn't quite found his vocal potential on the album although he gives plenty of aggressive and gruelling performances. Similarly Lars Ulrich's drumming does improve on the following two albums; it is sometimes low key in some areas on the album although he does pull off some stunning rhythms such as in 'Fight Fire With Fire'. These small pickings aside, Metallica work as a brilliant unit on this album. You can't fault the guitar play from Hammett and Hetfield and Cliff Burton's bass play is something else. The more you listen to this album, the more you can appreciate the blistering, resonating and sometimes cleverly distorted work from Burton's bass; it's truly awesome. 'Ride The Lightning' shows the Metallica of old; the band who were original and not interested in commerical success. The album is full of raw power and inspiration.<br /><br />'Fight Fire With Fire' gets this thrash metal classic going. Don't be fooled by the acoustic opening, the heaviness soon fades in. This opener is very aggressive and probably the rawest cut on the album. Snarling, complex guitar themes intertwine with a growling and angry vocal performance from James Hetfield and there is some great drumming from Lars Ulrich. The title track bursts in next. 'Ride The Lightning' is my personal favourite song on the album; a long but very spectacular song. Hetfield sings about a man condemned to death by the electric chair and his vocal style reflects this. The riff to the song is fearsome and the fast paced instrumental in the middle of the song is awesome; don't fail to listen to Cliff Burton's distorted bass in the background. One of Metallica's famous earlier songs, 'For Whom The Bell Tolls' follows. The lengthy cascading guitar opening is excellent and Hetfield gives a great vocal performance. Then, after all of these pacy, heavy tunes, 'Fade To Black' was a surprise for me, albeit a VERY good one. This lengthy metal ballad is the band's ode to suicide. Hetfield gives a more emotional vocal performance on this one. That's not to say the pounding riffs aren't there though and the song has a brilliant guitar exit.<br /><br />For the second half of the album, the intensity quickens up for 'Trapped Under Ice'. More snarling guitars, off beat pounding bass and a catchy chorus keep the high standard on the album going. 'Escape' is in a similar mold, with plenty of inspired guitar work. The album theme of death becomes even more plain with, you guessed it, 'Creeping Death'. If the hammering and dark opening chords don't entrance you into this song, then the lengthy vocal sequences with howls and thunderous guitar lines will. This is a masterful song. Then, to close the album, is the 9 minute instrumental, 'Call Of Ktulu'. This song, funnily enough co-written by Metallica exiled and later Megadeth guitarist Dave Mustaine, has a swirling, mysterious acoustic opening sequence. Eventhough it goes on just a little too long, the band give a powerful showcase on this song. Trademark pounding riffs are matched by great bass work from Cliff Burton; the song has some timeless melodies. The grand, crashing finish marks a classic end to a classic album.<br /><br />'Ride The Lightning' is a definitive metal album, and one of the greatest albums of the 80's as well as one of the band's best. This is a classic album from a genre defining band. In many ways it is quite sad to think how substandard this band's music has become over the past decade, no part due to the band going more commercial and shamelessly abandoning their thrash stylings (I'm looking at you, 'The Black Album'). However, the band's later failings aside, this album is amazing and is a must have!<br /><br />MY RATING: 9/10he lengthy vocal sequences with howls and thunderous guitar lines will.

B000B2YQX4|4.0|This is a solid and driven album by the great DM. This is their best album since Violater (my favorite). It doesn't beat Violater but it still comes in as a strong second.  <br /> <br />The beginning of the album hits you over the head with some dark, heavy, industrial sounding techno beats. However, I feel that the end of the album gets too muddy.  <br /> <br />That being said I would still recommend you buy it. Esp., if you're a DM fan.  <br /> <br />I hope they tour with this baby because they are soooo good live.
B00005JLWN|5.0|Wow, to my amazement this movie was a Blockbuster Hit! Ever since I've seen the Matrix, I've been a huge fan over that movie, thinking to myself that there would be no competition, until I rented Equilibriam. I was speechless by how all the effects and the beautiful art of gun melee fighting were, and the plot was stupendous, very similar to the novel/movie Fahrenheit 451, except it contained intense action. Although Equilibriam was a low budget film, limited to certain movie theaters, believe me, this movie is the \\"One\\"
B000BMSTMS|4.0|This is the best korn album since untouchables, which was the best korn album upto that point. Korn sometines has a problem with covering familier ground as in take a look in the mirror, which was good but not that different from earilier material. This is more experimental for them, and it sounds awsome. Much of the album(love song,seen it all), both lyricly and musicaly invites visual comparison, as if it were written for some gothic alice in wonderland type animation. Maby its more \\"nu\\" maby more industrial, whatever it is, people should stop trying to measure how much theve changed from what to what and just listen to the album. Good job korn. Great album.
B0007YMUZW|5.0|In the closing months of 2003, one of music's most prominent young songwriters released two drastically different, highly accredited albums before falling off stage and breaking his wrist while playing a show.  At the height of his fame, the continually prolific, (and self-proclaimed \\"firecracker\\") Adams withdrew from the public eye for much of 2004 in order to get healthy, both physically and mentally.<br /><br />  At the end of a much needed year or so of peace, Adams' began touring with his new band, The Cardinals; playing moody, jam-oriented shows to sold out crowds hungry for new songs.  Word began spreading in early 2005 that Adams had completed three new studio albums during his absence that would see release before the end of the year on Lost Highway records; the first of which was to be a criminally under-promoted double album entitled Cold Roses.<br /><br />  Before becoming a bona fide rock star in 2003, Adams' split his time playing county songs in old bars, busting band-mates heads, and writing candidly emotional songs with the proficiency of a sixties Bob Dylan.  Although he did focus on diversifying his sound as his career progressed, Adams continued to be a childish ball of fire up until his (nearly) career-ending injury.  With Cold Roses, Adams' reemerges as a thoughtful, mature songwriter; and for the first time in his career, a critical underdog.<br /><br />  Rather than writing a batch of songs and arranging them in the studio as per his usual methods, Adams and his touring band spent exhausting amounts of time perfecting their eighteen new compositions while on the road.  The result is a timeless album saturated with subtle themes ranging from the vast American landscape, to death, loss, and of course, old time values and beliefs.  Taking a less personal, more universal approach with his writing than usual, Adams and his band pay musical tribute to the distinct sounds of The Grateful Dead, Neil Young, ,and The Band while still maintaining their own brand of sun-drenched folk rock.<br /><br />  Spanning nearly eighty minutes over two discs, nearly all of Cold Roses is indispensable.  From the dark epic of the highly visual \\"Magnolia Mountain,\\" to the catchy (yet uncommonly eloquent) Carolina-country swagger of \\"Let It Ride,\\" Adams has found more modes than ever to utilize his natural propensity for old-time rock music.  \\"Easy Plateau,\\" \\"If I Am A Stranger,\\" \\"Dance All Night,\\" and at least half a dozen more are all high points in Adams' ever-swelling catalog, thus making Roses conceivably his most accomplished compilation of songs to date.<br /><br />  With each new album he releases, you can always expect to also see a new manifestation of Ryan Adams: the ever-morphing rock n' roll eccentric.  For allegiant fans who have long put up with him despite years of humiliating stunts and scandals, Roses is the ultimate pay-off.  Seemingly matured and (finally) responsible for his tremendous talent, Adams has at long last released a complete masterpiece.<br /><br />  An album with peaks as high as Cold Roses only hits a few times in any given decade.  Ryan Adams is right where he needs to be artistically; commercially underrated, yet without doubt, a top notch songwriter at the top of his game.  While Roses might lose a chunk of the younger audience his last few albums have established, it should do it's part in winning back original fans and finally convince a good number of his older, skeptical critics that he's the real deal.  Give Cold Roses a few unbiased listens-it might help you remember why you love music so much.  I recommend this album over anything I've come across since Wilco's Yankee Hotel Foxtrot album.heir own brand of sun-drenched folk rock. <br />      Spanning nearly eighty minutes over two discs, nearly all of Cold Roses is indispensable.

0060922583|5.0|This is a great book.  The first time I read it in 2001 I could not put it down.  I am now reading it again.  For someone like me with no science or physics background, he made everything easy to understand.
B00003CXN4|5.0|O.K., I may have missed some things here, but I think it's sad that this film, which actually had a message, has a lower average review rating than \\"Miss Congeniality\\".  I mean, come on!  Yeah, they're not in the same genre but I would much rather watch this film that \\"Miss Congeniality\\".  That film was formulaic and clichd. <br /> <br />Also, just as a disclaimer, I only saw the edited TV version so I am missing some scenes and dialogue, especially the obscene ones.  But until then I had only heard of this film and didn't really go out of my way to watch it.  After watching just the TV-edited version though I now want to see the whole thing. <br /> <br />Let's get one thing straight here: this isn't some after-school special with an anti-drug message.  Actually, I didn't even get an anti-drug message at all.  All I got was the showing of the effects of drugs and the drug war, JUST like the song \\"Master Of Puppets\\" by Metallica.  Now, yes, those things were bad but aren't they also true? <br /> <br />Anyway, I thought the film was entertaining and a good eye-opener to how the DEA is always criminalizing these drug dealers while at the same time regular people whom they might know are the ones supporting these drug dealers by being their consumers.  The acting is good, the characters and script are good (I especially like Don Cheadle, who's a very underrated actor) and the whole thing VERY gritty and maybe even a little disturbing.  The one thing I didn't like was the cinematography, or more specifically, the lightning.  I hate that \\"always dark\\" effect.  Can't they use some normal lighting?  I know the different colors were used to designate the different plotlines but I still didn't like them.  The ending was good too, although my two questions are why was Don Cheadle's character so confident that they were going to get the drug lord this second time around with the bug plant, and how could a person like Catherine Zeta Jones' character (I don't know the names as Ionly saw it once on TV) could support her husband after what he put her and her child through.  Yeah, she wanted to get him out of jail and everything but how could she totally convert to a supporter of his career?  Well, maybe that's just the way they wanted the story to be but I didn't really get what changed her like that. <br /> <br />Some people here are saying this movie is biased, racist and I think even unrealistic.  How?  This movie wasn't trying to explore the \\"averge\\" when it comes to drugs so much as it was trying to show the key elements of the drug world.  One guy complained that there was a black drug dealer \\"corrupting\\" the rich white girl.  O.K., why is this a race thing?  There are black drug dealers and Cincinnati (which is the city I thought it took place in) has black people, including black drug dealers.  The girl was white because that's what her parents were and they were trying to portray the good, blonde, straight A's girl becoming a junkie.  So what?  The whole remark about catching the \\"white guys\\" was because the white guys are the ones IN THE COUNTRY that run the show.  All the drug cartels are in Mexico and other Latin countries and they obviously can't go and arrest people from other countries, so, duh, they go after the \\"white guys\\", which they did.  The whole Mexico thing was shown that way because it was showing the top level of the corruption amongst the officials and the trickle effects to the police officer.  Yes, not every situation is like this but it was just making the point that these situations exist and this is what they're like.  This movie wasn't about a few people buying a little pot, some detectives busting a small-time dealer and an average girl with parents that have average jobs, developing a slight drug addiction.  God, look at it for what it is. <br /> <br />Anyway, this movie's good.  I mean, come on, at least give it a 4-star review!  Maybe it has some flaws but name one movie that didn't.  Even if you do I'msure there'll be a hundred people to argue otherwise.  Just watch this movie and stop trying to make it like some cornball anti-drug program.  This does not deserve a 3 1/2-star average rating.
B000BOH8XW|5.0|I have both Oral Fijacion and Oral Fixation albums. They are two very different albums and complement each other well. The lyrics for Oral Fixation Vol.2 are beautiful and Shaki's delivery of it is spectacular. \\"How Do You Do\\" is delivered in typical rock fashion with some experimental vocals in the background followed by \\"Don't Bother\\" which is fantastic and very \\"roca nueva del estilo\\". Next up is \\"Illegal\\" which is a very mellow song about breaking up (yep throw your Thin Lizzy records away, this album has it all, the finding of love, loss of love and star-crossed love, missed opportunities etc). This album is about life and the tribulations of love. Every song is exquisitely composed and rapturously sung. Shakira is able to express emotion into her English songs more than in Laundry Service which really adds another dimension to the lyrics.. <br /> <br />Don't buy this CD looking for a myriad of disjointed quick catchy pop songs or an English translation of \\"Fijacion Oral\\", buy this album because you love listening to a talented singer, a mature voice and a stolid lyrical story (I'd also go so far as to say an autobiography).
B00005JO1Y|5.0|Peter Jackson's take on King Kong is the best moviegoing experience I've had this year.  If you want to nitpick you can but the movie works too damn well.  Here's a list of how Kong gives the most bang for your buck of any movie released in 2005.<br /><br />1.  Fully developed characters that give you a reason to keep that gluteus maximus planted in that theater seat for the 3 hour plus duration.  Check. Jack Black's low key (but slightly frenetic) Carl Denham is believable and alternately despicable, and while I fully expected some type of Tenacious D freak out it never emerges (but you know it was there, in the back of his mind).  Adrien Brody as playwright/screenwriter Jack Driscoll gives us the quintessential workingman prototype without falling into cliche, and his heroism emerges from the workingman ethic (which only adds to the credibility of the character).  An unexpected Kyle Chandler (from the TV show Early Edition) plays the vain and shallow Bruce Baxter, the star of Denham's picture.  Andy Serkis gets to truly show his mettle as the wise sea dog cook, Lumpy (oh yeah he also plays a gorilla).  Naomi Watts as Ann Darrow gives the performance of her career.  In the past I've been on the fence about her, not feeling she truly deserved her \\"star\\" status.  I have since changed my mind.  Not only is she down right gorgeous but she acts her heart out, presenting the greatest display of onscreen make believe I've ever witnessed.  Remember, the big gorilla you see on the screen isn't actually there.<br /><br />2.  Eye-popping, mind-boggling special fx.  Check.  They may as well just give King Kong the Oscar for that category. While some of the green screen shots (especially during the stampede) can't quite convince the eyes, the amount of fx techno-dazzle is unprecedented.  Filmdom, the ante has been upped.  This is a creature fest of epic (and by epic I mean huge) proportions.  Dinosaurs, insects, arachnids, and bats.  The creepy crawlies abound.  Here is the escapist buffet that Hollywood execs should be learning from.  Make no mistake, King Kong is a film hybrid that rings of purity, an action yarn, a love story, an ode to the past, all wrapped in a horror movie shell.  While you won't believe everything you see in King Kong (and you shouldn't) you will believe in a good 90 percent.  1930's New York is eerily realistic and Kong is just, well Kong is just real.<br /><br />3.  One big monkey that somehow manages to simultaneously awe, frighten, and convey intelligence and nobility.  Check.  I was part of the school that called for recognition for Andy Serkis as Gollum in the Lord of the Rings trilogy. That call must be raised again.  I loved the original '33 Kong and hated the first remake with it's unacceptable monkey suit.  This King Kong is the best of the bunch.  Arguably there is a little disparity between budgets alloted for each film, but all the money in the world doesn't guarantee a good movie.  The combination of motion capture with CGI is the best innovation to film in the past twenty years and Peter Jackson is it's reigning champion.  His reliance on the intuition and observation skills of Serkis is amply and beautifully rewarded.  Like Gollum, but in a grander sense, the fx used for Kong work because the audience is entrenched in empathetic emotional responses.  When the king of Skull Island is enraged we're furious right along with him, when he's amused we're chuckling as well.<br /><br />Much has been said and written about how the original King Kong inspired Peter Jackson to pursue film making as his career.  What hasn't been postulated is how Jackson's version quite possibly could be that catalyst for some bright eyed, imaginative child blossoming into a wunderkind director of the future.  I think Peter Jackson's King Kong has that potential to motivate beyond anything produced since the first Jurassic Park.  Perhaps in this speculative future dictionaries will be graced with poster art from this film rightnext to one word: Spectacle.<br /><br />If you want a startling reminder as to why we go to the movies buy a ticket to King Kong.  Whatever the ticket price you will be exponentially rewarded in entertainment value.film right next to one word: Spectacle. <br /> <br />If you want a startling reminder as to why we go to the movies buy a ticket to King Kong.

B00005Y46O|5.0|I have just purchased this after owning the original LP for so many years... the remastering has really made this a great release audio wise and the  extra tracks are a great bonus... I just about knew the original album cut of All Right Now off by heart with the guitar cutting in and out... Now there's a fresh version to memorise, even though it becomes apparent why this track was not originally included - Paul muffs up one of the vocal lines... but nothing to worry about. <br />Mr Big is also another standout track... Andy Fraser's bass solo still gets me even to this day... awesome! Kirke's drumming as ever is also excellent throughout... What a great band. Buy this album, it's a must have for Free fans!
0895260131|5.0|First off, Mr. Spencer is the director of Jihad Watch and a Catholic. He an apologist for the Catholic Church and the Crusades. Mr. Spencer definitely has an axe to grind with Islam. Either way his wonderful little propaganda piece called a book never once questions the practices of christians or the christian church, both catholic and protestant.  <br />The cover of this masterpiece of literature says it all (A masked man with a rifle). It is a good attempt at playing to people's fears. The cover attempts to elicit from the reader the feeling of being threatened.  <br />I perused through this nonsense at the bookstore and he does a great job of providing information in a soundbyte manner and he takes liberties with historical accuracy, if it can be called accurate to begin with. He claims that Europe was threatened by the muslims, which is why the Crusades took place. The crusades, he claims, were an act of self defense. The self defense theory is great. inventive and delusional. I may use that one myself.  <br />Mr. Spencer riddles his book with half truths and a great deal of dis-information. He does a great job in working to have the reader rally behind christianity (especially Catholicism).  <br /> <br />So, after reading this book prepare your horses and battle gear. Raise the flag and get ready to crusade.  <br />
B000AP04EW|1.0|Ok first of all there are so many things wrong with this movie. Lets start with the idea of the movie. HORRIBLE. You dont have crazy killers liveing in the same house. Dumb ok. Ok then we have the catch phrases. Like when they are fighting, Brad says whos your dady. Then Angelina kicks him out of jelousy and totally steals his catch phrase, she just adds a now to it. Then they blow up there house cause there dumb. The worst part was when they were in that gunfight full of people. They got those super body armors. Not one of those F***ing idiots thought about shooting them in the head. COME ON MAN, its a no brainer. Shot them in the head and POOOOOOOOOOOOOOOFFFFF, problem done. Thats why i give this movie 1 bullet wound out of 5.  <br /> <br /> <br />(P.S. if you want action and greatness, i suggest the pest.)
B000001FDK|4.0|GREASE-VARIOUS ARTISTS: Is there a man, woman, or child among us who has not surrendered to the charms of this classic musical/comedy dose of nostalgic kitsch? Admittedly, AMERICAN GRAFFITI was a more accurate portrayal of the ducktail 'n poodle-skirts era and featured authentic oldies by the original artists, but GREASE has proven to have unlimited mainstream appeal across several generations. Even enjoyed separately from the flick, this high-spirited soundtrack is a hoot; JOHN TRAVOLTA does his best belting ever in tandem with the always capable OLIVIA NEWTON-JOHN on the high-spirited YOU'RE THE ONE THAT I WANT, and is no mean slouch as he solos on the semi-raunchy, ELVIS-inspired showstopper GREASED LIGHTNING. Liv carries a winsome torch on the breathless ballad HOPELESSLY DEVOTED TO YOU, FRANKI VALLI perks up the BEE GEES-penned title tune, Pink Ladies leader STOCKARD \\"RIZZO\\" CHANNING, eternal teenager FRANKIE AVALON, and retro-mongers SHA NA NA all excel at their turns at bat. A harmless hodgepodge of rock, pop and doo wop that continues to resonate with audiences several decades after the fact, GREASE is still the word.<br /><br />RATING: FOUR COMBS
B00006LI26|5.0|This is the foundation where ALL Speed Metal started at. <br /> <br />So many Metal bands were started from this one CD. <br /> <br />The next 2 CDs after this one were the foundations of all Power Metal. <br /> <br />So many Metal bands were started from those 2 CDs as well. <br /> <br />(That's the history that CD). <br /> <br /> <br />(The music itself).  Kai Hansen's singing is a little off here and there, but the guitar work is outstanding, and this is kick-you-in-your-face and take no prisoners Metal. <br /> <br />Helloween would never be this heavy ever again, even until today. <br /> <br />This was before Michael Kiske came into the band.  He would come into the band on the next CD that came after this one. <br /> <br /> <br />Also, if you like the \\"Helloween EP\\" and \\"Walls of Jericho\\" CD, DEFINITELY make sure you get the \\"Batallions of Fear\\" CD and \\"Follow the Blind\\" CD from Blind_GuardiaN. <br /> <br />Those 2 Blind_GuardiaN CDs are a direct clone / exact replica of the \\"Helloween EP\\" and \\"Walls of Jericho\\" CD from Helloween.  Even Kai Hansen sings some on the \\"Follow the Blind\\" CD from Blind_GuardiaN. <br />
B000006045|5.0|because last time i wrote a review, it didn't work. My real review will follow this one.
0671027344|3.0|I read the whole thing in a span of 2 days.  It's a quick and easy read.  The characters are interesting at best, but nothing about this book is compelling.  At first I was very impressed by this book, but after episode after episode of clichs it became boring.      While I was enjoying the first segment, which had a very nice crescendo at the end of Part 1, I learned that the book was published by MTV.  The later parts all then made sense because they were simple recyclings of themes and ideas.  Overall the book has interesting enough characters to read the whole thing, but after part 1 it just got boring.
B00004Z459|5.0|What can i say, this album is incredible. Its music is awsome, and the way its sung, and played are very, i repeat, very good. Some people may say that LP is not original, but they are wrong. Somehow LP managed to stay original with this album despite all the other music band's, and artists.     *Papercut- A great song, with an explosive opening. It is mainly rapped, but Chester Bennington does a great job. The guitar work is excellent too! It is just amazing! The DJ also does his part well. 9/10    *One Step Closer- This song is the reason that LP is so famous.It is the first song by LP that was made into a video. It has a great chorus, with no rapping what so ever. It has an explosive opening with a loud ending. Probably the most famous part of this song is the \\"Shut up, when I'm talking to you!\\". I played it in full volume and it hurt my ears SO MUCH. Probably my 2nd favorite song on the album. 9/10    *With You- I really like this song. The chorus could use some work, and the guitar parts are just awsome!. It could use some work. 8/10    *Points of Authority- Wow, the opening guitar part is my FAVORITE. It has always been one of my dreams to play guitar like that. Mike Shinoda starts of with a fast paced rap which leads to Chestor Bennington's lovely lyrics. The chorus in this one is good, but it's better in the reanimation version of this song. I like this song a lot, just by hearing it, i can tell that LP has put in a lot of work in this song. 8/10    *Crawling- This was the first song that i heard by LP. It was the song that made me like LP, it is LP'S Grammy Winning song. The lyrics in this song are really good, they have a haunted and dark feel towards it. This is a loud song, but there are no screaming parts. Mike Shinoda doesnt have a role in this song at all. Not a good thing, not a bad thing. I just dont think that he would have had a good part in the song. A great song, i like the chorus a lot, the guitar parts are really good as well. 8/10    *Runaway- This is a good song, it is not the best song by LP. I think that there have been better songs by them. The openeing DJ work is good. The guiatar scenes are ok, they get anoying after a long time. I am not crazy about the song, but I like them. This is not LP'S Best work, it could use a bit more work. 7/10    *By Myself- I really, really like this song. It's mood and pace just shifts automaticly. The chorus is awsome! and the lyrics really dont need work. A work of art. 9/10    *In the End- Oh my God, I love this song! It has the 2nd best lyrics in any LP song. I love it, Mike's raps are interupted by Chestor's voice, but that is a good thing. He doesnt scream at all in this song. It's LP'S second softest songs. The chorus has a great feel and mood to it, it makes you want to sing along with the music. Some say that this song is played a lot in the radio, but i think its a good thing. This song is so easy to listen to. You will like it, theres nothing more to it. 9/10    *A Place for My Head- My favorite song by LP. This song is the song I play all the time! I LOVE IT! The song is rapped throughout intensilly. The opening guitar part is AWSOME. The chorus is loud and great! It has one great quite scene then... GO AWAY!, comes blasting in the scene. The second half of the song is the best part, the ending when he goes, \\"Get Away From Me!\\" Is AWSOME. I love this song, I dont need to say anymore. 10/10    *Forgotten- I like this song, it has a koud chorus and good guitar parts. There's not much to say other than it is a great song. 8/10    *Cure for the Itch- I like this song. It is entirely DJ Work, i prfer Session of Meteora though, this just isn't as good.    *Pushing me Away- I love this song. The opening DJ Work is Awsome! It has a dark mood to it. The chorus is fast paced, with no screaming. I like the guitar parts. I think the guitar they use is a buzz saw one, I am not sure. My favorite part in the song is \\"The Sacrific...\\" I love it, and the ending is a niceone thoug it could have been a bit louder for this kind of a song. I liked this song a lot, i constantly listen to it, the adictive chorus makes me want to sing along with it! 8/10    This is a great album, people should definatly buy it. It is a great album!    BUY IT!!
B000AMJDHY|1.0|This band sucks.  My roommate will not stop playing this album.  All of the songs sound exactly the same, but have completely unnecessary and random bridges.  The canned techno in the middle of track two almost made me barf.  The lyrics make no sense at all.  Awful awful album.
B000BO0LLS|5.0|The first release was off the hook!!!!! It feels soooo good to hear 'THE VOICE\\"again!!!!! Ever song is listenable and gets you mooven. The four extra songs are just what a true Mariah Carey fan wants to hear!! I listen to this cd everyday!! BRING ON THE NEXT ONE BOO BOO, HONEY B FLY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B0000AQS6R|5.0|I agree with reviewers who say this is the best of the vacation series, and I never get tired of watching this movie.  While it seems a little tame and not quite as outrageous by today's standards, it has lost nothing in the way of hilarity over the years since it was first released.  There are scenes that will stick with you for years, and bring some good chuckles long after you've seen it.  For me the best example of this is the squirrel in the tree fiasco, with the ensuing freakouts among the family, and Chevy Chase waging war on the little thing.  I thoroughly enjoyed this movie, and watch it again at every opportunity I get.  Many of my friends who don't like slapstick so much also did not like this movie...so be warned, if you don't see the humor in stuff like the 3 Stooges, you may not enjoy this as much as I did.
B000BW7QWW|5.0|I first have to admit that I am not a sci-fi fan and have not seen many sci-fi movies.  But this is by far one of the best movies of 2005.  I give director/writer Joss Whedon full credit, he made me a fan with the witty dialogue, energetic special effects, and creative storyline.  If you like Serenity, I suggest you to get a copy of Firefly TV series.  You will not regret it!
B00005JOFO|5.0|The last thing I expected to find on a Monday night was  a small, indie movie theatre sold out of tickets to see what has been termed the \\"gay cowboy movie\\". Yet, when I went to see Brokeback Mountain last night, I found myself one of the last moviegoers to find a seat in a theatre overflowing with people from all walks of life.  <br /> <br />Upon first hearing of this movie, I considered it laughable to have an entire film set around two cowboys falling in love, for it seemed, at best, to be a chick-flick with a political agenda. However, my predication's were quickly discarded. This film is much undeserving of it's \\"gay cowboy\\" stereotype, as it cannot convey the emotional aspect which will inevitably overcome the most callous of moviegoers. For what this movie provides is a heart wrenching tale of two thoroughly complex men, struggling with societal pressures and their desire to be themselves.  <br /> <br />The story told in this film is of two men, who meet while working one summer herding sheep on top of, what else, but Brokeback Moutnain. Ennis Del Marr (played by Heath Ledger) and Jack Twist (played by Jake Gyllenhaal) find themselves with idle time and only each other to fill it. They spend days riding around on horses and nights sitting around a campfire, talking and drinking whisky. Ennis rarely speaks, and when he does, his words are simple. Jack, on the other hand, is more outgoing in nature. At this time, his spirit seems playful, yet experienced, making for a sharp contrast with that of Ennis. In a surprising turn, for both the viewers and the characters themselves, Jack and Ennis find themselves filled with a primal urges which fuels their first sexual encounter which is void of seduction. They next morning,they both assert that they are not \\"queer\\", yet continue with the relationship, never speaking of their bond, perhaps because they knew no words to define it. When it comes time for them to part, you can see anguish on both character's faces, believing that they will never see the other again. Both characters marry andestablish families before they meet again. When they find each other four years after their work on Brokeback Mountain, they are instantly drawn together again and establish a relationship where they meet a few times a year, for fishing trips where no fish is ever caught. Their story spans 20 years, culminating in a hauntingly tragic ending. <br /> <br />Credit must given to the actors in this film, who truly gave the meaning to each and every character. Much attention should be paid to Heath Ledger, an actor with potential who could never seem to break away from the teen demographic for which his prior films have been marketed. His portrayal of Ennis Del Marr is heartbreaking. With few words, he was able to reveal a array of emotions. With just one look, he could communicate more then words could ever describe. His performance is the reason I cannot get this film out of my mind, a full day since I was present in the theatre. Ledger has found the small intricacies which make this character come to life. The low, rasping voice which seems to come from it's disuse, as well as the slight hunch which hides Ledger's height and conveys his characters venerability. A simple shot of Ledger's soulful eyes can tell the viewers all they need to know about his emotional duress, and will surely leave every onlooker teary-eyed. The way in which he clings to a shirt of Jack's, still upon it's hanger was able to say all that Ennis could not express with words, and was one of the most poignant scenes in the film. In supporting roles, Michelle Williams (as Alma), Anne Hathaway (as Lureen), and Jake Gyllenhaal all do incredible jobs as well, each bringing an intense believability to the roles in which they portrayed. The melancholy nature with which this film concludes, does so, in part because of the exquisite changes each actor brings to their character. <br /> <br />It has been a day since I experianced this movie, yet I can still feel it's ramifications churning in the pit of my stomach. The heartache felt by Ennis Del Marr has yet to leave my being, as my mind reels. This film brings to life a story which will not quickly leave me, one which was so realistic in manner I feel almost as if I had experianced it all myself. Do not be quick to write this movie off as just one of \\"gay cowboys,\\" or a movie with a political agenda. This is a movie with heart, compassion and lose. This is a movie not to be forgotten
B00008H2LB|5.0|Okay, I have to get some things clear. Number one, Linkin Park is not a metal band. They fuse hip  hop and rock to make a different nu-metal sound. and they shouldn't be classified as nu-metal either, if you count songs such as \\"Breaking the Habit\\" or \\"Cure for the Itch\\". Number two, don't compare them with rock bands such as Metallica or AC/DC, because, once again, Linkin Park is not pure rock. Now, on with my review. I got this CD sometime in December 2004, and it has been my favorite album ever since. I liked the way they wrote the lyrics and the choruses in a few songs. From the hard rapping of \\"Faint\\" to the haunting themes of \\"Breaking the Habit\\", these songs all fit in to make one perfect package. Please give this CD a shot, because you never know when you can get hooked to a band.
1558908382|5.0|A great movie from a great actor and talent filled staff. Those who complain about the violence are missing the whole point, it's a dark comedy! Gun battles with hundreds of rounds coming from guns that hold 13 rounds is part of the intended humor. Perhaps these reviewers are somewhat wimpy.
B000BNX3B4|3.0|MUST LOVE DOGS is everything you'd expect it to be with a title like that: a silly rehash of internet dating, this time with older candidates all recently divorced, trying not to appear to ridiculous in this cyberworld of instant matchmaking.  The script is weak, the story old hat, but with a cast like this, who cares?  Watching the likes of Diane Lane, Elizabeth Perkins, John Cusack, Stockard Channing, Dermot Mulroney, and Christopher Plummer in an ensemble covers a lot of cracks in a flimsy script.  The overall effect seems to be one of an attempt to make a statement about the current conditions of relationships in the computer age among divorced people. It doesn't: it just throws out  a lot of clich&eacute;s which are delivered with as much panache as possible by this cast of talented actors, seemingly on break! Grady Harp, December 05
0312954468|5.0|Just finished reading my first work by Wilbur Smith and was very impressed.  This book has it all - trials and tribulations of ancient Egypt, love, war, torture, humor, etc.  One of the best novels I have ever read.  Will definitely read other works by this talented author.  Highly recommend.
B00005JO1Y|3.0|Of course, King Kong is gonna do great business around the world and attract audiences from all over the world and be a big bang. It's worth the money especially since it's a 3hour7minute film full of dinosaurs,large insects,bats,giant birds and of course our beloved King Kong.<br /><br />The action blows away most of what you might have seen for a long time and competition can lay off but it is truly the storyline and the casting that fails to make this a complete epic or an erstwhile great flick. There are a lot of loopholes in this entertainer and no, I'm not the kind of person who wants things to be explained to him but it's just the way in which the story unfolds that leaves a lot to be desired. Around 20 minutes into the film, one is left wondering where's the director gonna take the film from here.<br /><br />Like Lord Of The Rings, this film takes it times to create the effect of a time distant from today and there are a few scenes where the cinematography is quite good.<br /><br />However, there were many times in the film I felt that the story needed a push and better editing because it induces sleep. There's a good one hour before Kong shows us his teeth, his questionable transfer from Skull Island to America, Adrien Brody's shabby lovers miscast, the absence of blood on actors when obviously expected (probably to win a U certificate) were soem things that I could not turn a blind eye too.<br /><br />Naomi Watts does an OK job though she doesnt really sizzle in anyway. King Kong is just right for his size until the time he starts swinging on rocks and hanging from cliffs. The much exaggerated love affair between Watts and Brody is irritating especially when Kong falls of Empire State Building. Some of the best scenes in the film were the ones with Kong and Watts alone (ice,building,dance,etc)<br /><br />There was not one scene in this film that made me go WHOA! with the earnestness of a movie lover that I am. There were atleast 2-3 scenes in all of the LOTR Trilogy that did the same for me. I was very enthusiastic about this film but it failed due to a mammoth random sampling of individuals and sequences in not the most perfect way. It is impossible for King Kong to have been perfect but it's the magic of film making that truly brings the best out of mankind and I expect Peter Jackson to capture that essence.<br /><br />A very staunch effort,glorious budget,enthusiastic script yet a very disappointed Kong Lover,that's me..<br /><br />PS- Of course I will watch this film atleast two times more. However, I'm gonna have to wait for HBO to obtain the rights cause I'm gonna spend many Saturdays sitting on my couch enjoying Kong's roars yet recalling...ll of the LOTR Trilogy that did the same for me.

B000A7S4B0|5.0|I loved their first disc and liked the second.  While this is a departure for them, it is still a very solid set of songs.   <br /> <br />However, please know that you cannot import the songs into iTunes and cannot play them on an iPod.  If you are a Mac user, you're out of luck.
6305558175|4.0|A complete new vision of the South after the defeat from what we could imagine if we only knew « Gone with the Wind ». This little town and its one plantation gets its master back but he is different. The community, blacks and whites together, is going to invest all it has to re-plant the plantation in ... tobacco. A collective enterprise coming from the southerners themselves. That is a modern vision, probably not what really happened. No carpetbaggers, just plain more or less honest southerners who want to live and who want their community to find a new future, and this community is able to accept the two racial groups working together and the Blacks to become landowners. The Ku Klux Klan is shown as rather feeble. It probably was a lot harsher, if we believe history books. An identity imbroglio and a murder accusation later the main hero is going to be hanged. He is tried by a jury in a court presided by a black judge. I find that a little bit fast, hardly two or three years after the Civil War, and the judge is in his fifties. Modern rewriting too. All that to produce a very strongly emotional romance that has all the necessary details to work marvellously, even if there is no epic or tragic dimension, just plain dramatic. But dramatic is good enough to be emotional. We can do without tragedy all the time. And epics are kind of superreal to be emotional. In other words an interesting rewriting of the Reconstruction in the South. It could have been like that if ... But the problem at the time was that if ... precisely.<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, Universit&eacute; Paris Dauphine, Universit&eacute; Paris I Panth&eacute;on Sorbonne
B000301YY8|5.0|I loved everything about this CD.  Track 4 is my favorite, it alomst makes me cry it's so beauiful. I only wish he had more CDs out...
B000B8QEZG|3.0|This is all joints & jams - no ballads or grooves.  There are 2 Eastern-influenced songs - \\"Isaac\\" (featuring Yitzhak Sinwani) and \\"Push\\", a la of her \\"Ray of Light\\" album - and 2 songs produced by Bloodshy & Avant. The line about \\"U can 'F' off\\" (using the letter 'F', not the word) in \\"I Love New York\\" is corny, but all-in-all a good album.  Booklet does not include lyrics.
B000002UJQ|2.0|Radiohead, and this album in particular, are an anomoly. Some people think they are the best band in the world, and seem unable to understand others not caring for them. This makes others angry. <br /> <br />My opinion of this album is that it is over-rated, it is not genious. I have owned the CD for about 5 years now, and every time I put it on I get the same feeling, it just doesnt hit the mark for me. They know how to play their instruments, and there's some interesting ideas, but it lacks something. I would go as far as to agree with those who call it pretentious. <br /> <br />Throughout, the lyrics seem like someone had taken a left-wing political treatise and a 50's science fiction story, cut them both into pieces and tossed them up in the air - it's hard to tell whether they're trying to communicate and failing, or simply trying to be clever. <br /> <br />Some of the tracks are just plain dull - \\"Exit Music\\" and \\"The Tourist\\" for example. I also have to take issue with the percussion on this album. The cymbols and drums do not sound quite right, it's very odd, and hard to explain, but I think they have tried to create a different sound and have failed because it's unmusical to my ears. <br /> <br />To sum up, I fail to see what people get out of this album, I really do. I have tried to find some hidden message in the whole thing, there isnt one, and as music it fails to excite me except on the odd track. <br /> <br />The Radiohead cult is the biggest pyramid scheme in the history of modern music. You have been warned.
B000002LR6|4.0|\\"Psalm 69,\\" Ministry's fifth album, released in 1992, which was the follow-up to \\"The Mind is a Terrible Thing to Taste,\\" is very dark and acidic but also equally as rhythmic. It's full of rigid (yet non-dominating) guitars, thumping drums, and rather raspy vocals. This album is worth buying just for the mighty catchy hit single \\"Jesus Built My Hot Rod.\\" I've heard this song (fairly accurately) described as sounding like a square dance at a mental hospital. Here, guest vocalist Gibby Haynes spouts nonsense scat like \\"ding a ding dang my dang a long ling long.\\" But that isn't the only good song on here. Another high point is the album opener, \\"N.W.O.\\" This song, which stands for \\"New World Order,\\" samples a speech made by George H. W. Bush, and has a very catchy (if repetitive) rhythm which is worthy of a toe-tapping. Track two, \\"Just One Fix,\\" has punching drums and chugging guitars which wouldn't be out of place on a Rammstein record. Likewise, \\"Hero\\" is very speedy, with fast, running guitars. The last highlight on here is the foreboding and apocalyptic title track, which has several whiplash tempo changes. Even though it could stand to be a bit longer, \\"Psalm 69\\" is a C.D. which is as great as it is influential. And it's the sound of this band (and this album) in fine form, so it will forever be a milestone on industrial metal's timeline.
B0006SSOHC|3.0|I prefer scary movies that are heavy on the suspense, light on the bloodshed, which is why I gave this movie 3 stars. This movie was very, very bloody. There were a couple of twists, to be sure, but I would say that the extreme grisliness outweighed the suspense.<br /><br />\\"Saw\\" made me think of a very long music video, which is not necessarily a bad thing. I did think that it borrowed a lot from \\"Seven\\", which starred Brad Pitt.
B000B8QEYC|2.0|I'm a big fan of Enya.  I own every US release, and love them all... except this one.  I've read the reviews and heard all the fans saying it's great, classic, Enya material.  A little TOO classic, I'd say.  If many of the songs sound familiar, I don't think it has anything to do with the Enya \\"formula\\".  They sound familiar because they sound like poor rip-offs of her previous hits.  Sure, many of her songs on albums past have recalled even earlier songs.  But on Amarantine, the reminder is not a nostalgiac turn, or a return to by-gone greatness.  The attempt to replicate the success of older hits by replicating their sound seems blatant, and in all ways unworthy of Enya.  What happened?  How could she be so desperate for new material that she has to rip off herself!?!  I won't say this album has nothing good on it.  That would be too harsh.  But just because it's our first taste of Enya in a while doesn't make it a good album.  Maybe it's like that thing about dying of thirst in a desert, then thinking rusty water is red wine.  Listen to your Enya collections in chronological order, ending with Amarantine and THEN try to honestly say that this is a good CD.
B0009HLDFU|5.0|at first when i got the album i thought it was okay but then as i listened to it more and more in the car i noticed that before EVERY SINGLE song i would say \\"oh! i love this one!\\" and i still do it. it's because there's not one song on either disc that i want to skip. the acoustic cd is really soothing and the rock disc is a lot of fun, and especially when seen live, may i just say that no one rocks harder than the foos.<br /><br />&lt;33 it.
B00000AFGM|5.0|This is the Rock album for people who don't like Rock music.  It's even for non-fans of Marilyn Manson.  The music transcends.  The lyrics alone make this album great; the music makes it mesmerizing.  A must-have: this album gets better with time.  <br />
B000AM6MKU|4.0|My review is not of the movie or the item itself.  It is a warning for those considering ordering this item if you live in a cold weather state.  I ordered this as a Christmas present for my nephew.  It was delivered on time.  I was home at the time of delivery around 6:00pm Chicago time (where it has been averaging 10 degrees for the last week).  When I opened the box, I noticed that the Items I purchased were wet.  The liquid was coming from the Polar Express Gift Set.  The liquid in the snow globe was frozen, which caused the plastic globe to expand forcing it to separate from its base.  I'm guessing my package sat in the UPS truck all day before it was delivered to my house.  I can't exchange it because it will only happen again. <br />Merry Christmas <br />
B0000DDAU9|4.0|Many have become fans of this band only after \\"Leviathan\\" was released, and are completely unaware that Mastodon have other albums, including \\"Remission\\" (their first full length album), which is almost equally as great. This disc isn't a concept album, so it's not as smart as \\"Leviathan,\\" but it's also much easier to swallow and it doesn't take several listens to absorb. \\"Remission\\" not only has as much good musicianship as \\"Leviathan,\\" but it also packs a greater, walloping, initial impact, so one could argue that it is as good or better than that album. Its huge, Sabbath-y, crushing/lumbering riffs, pounding drums, chunky rhythms, and visceral yells make these songs very explosive and brutal. \\"Crusher Destroyer\\" has ultra-heavy, steam rolling riffs, whereas \\"Where Strides the Behemoth\\" and \\"Mother Puncher\\" are backed by fiery chug and churn guitars. Other highlights include the machine gun, stutter-stepping, cascading riffs on \\"Burning Man,\\" the crunchy, churning, appropriately titled \\"Trainwreck,\\" and the instrumental album closer. And even if you disagree that it is better, there's almost no denying that all Mastodon fans need to own this album, too, and you will enjoy it equally as much as anything else this band has made.
0375507256|5.0|David Mitchell not only possesses an imagination that rivals that of Isaac Asimov, but his ear for dialect and language rivals that of Mark Twain in Huckelberry Finn. This book is as much fun to read as your favorite pulp fiction novel, but as rich as the best fiction of the decade.
B0001L3MI0|5.0|The plot for this film was invented by H.G.Wells in 1898. It was followed up by Orson Welles in 1938. It has been repeated several times since: sometimes the aliens are destroyed by a virus, sometimes by Slim Whitman, but it's such a good plot that it's difficult to improve upon, and it's always been popular. So much for the plot. In this version the acting was good, and the dialogue was perfectly OK. The story moves along at a great pace, and there's always something interesting to gawp at. This is exactly what I like to see: heroes saving the world, baddies coming to bad ends, leaders leading from the front, family values and true love conquering. Just the stuff to fill in some time with a bit of escapist fantasy, humour and entertainment. Fortunately I'm not gifted with the genius of all those one-star reviewers, with their giant intellects, who are able to explain all the technical faults so excellently, but sometimes I think it's a bit funy that thy knt seme to spel to wel. I enjoyed this movie, but it wasn't quite as good as Robin Hood, which was much more realistic and credible. But better than Saving Private Ryan.
B000AYEIZY|5.0|I was channel surfing three weeks ago when I saw what appeared to be the oldest man in the world playing bass. However, he was playing it extraordinarily skillfully. Then the camera panned to another man looking even older and he was playing drums and exceptionally well at that. I then recognized Eric Clapton and realized that the RAH concert of Cream was being broadcast on my local PBS station.  <br /> <br />I was transfixed. The musicianship of these three was awe inspiring and caused me to turn on my computer and immediately order the DVD from Amazon.  <br /> <br />Compared to the musical trash currently popular at the moment with computerized drums and keyboards what you see here are the three best players at their positions in Pro Bowl form.  <br /> <br />This is a musical tour de force. Clapton must have practiced for hours a day for a month to get ready for this and so too Ginger and Jack. If they have lost a step they are still miles ahead of any behind them. <br /> <br />If you have some children listening to hip hop or Brittany who what to see what music should be show them this. Three guys playing great. No show, no dancing, no BS. This DVD is spectacular. Buy it. I did. <br />
B00000292K|4.0|This was indeed a controversial album when it came out and attracted the ire of many a jazz fan. Why? Because On The Corner eschews conventional jazz structure:there are no head arrangements or overt melodies despite some very interesting solo work. Rather this album consists of long, floating funky rhythmic jams over which soloists glide in and out making for a dense kind of free afro-psychedelica where rhythm rather than melody is paramount. It's a facinating listen, not unlike the beautiful In A Silent Way, but much harder and diverse in texture and melodically looser. And like In A Silent Way there's also a timeless quality to this recording. Not timeless in an historical sense, but in that the songs have no beginnings and no endings. You come into this recording at an arbitrary section, have a lookaround for an arbitrary length of time and then leave. It's like momentarily touching down on something infinite and has almost as much in common with current ambient electronica as it does with jazz. Not just for the way the music sounds but also how it was constructed. Many of the compositions were created by combining tracks from different takes or jams and mixing them together. That was a lot to ask of jazz fans of the time who thought of overdubs as studio trickery, much less creating whole new compositions by reassembling or looping pre-recorded tracks. In this day such practices are commonplace, but 1972 it was unheard of. I think fans of '70s electric Miles will probably like On The Corner, but other folks? Well, it's savory, but for special tastes.
B00004YX39|3.0|Fagen and Becker decided to take a twenty year hiatus after this effort, at least as a duo. Donald Fagen did some impressive solo work, and Becker did some producing, but it is easy to see why the two felt it necessary to take five... or twenty.<br /><br />  Although this is a good CD, it is probably their weakest offering, with their comeback CDs recapturing the magic that was the hallmark of all Dan recordings from the seventies. \\" Babylon Sisters\\" and the FM radio staple \\" Hey Nineteen\\" are alternately cautionary and fun, but the rest of the CD  tilts a little too far toward lounge act jazz. \\" Time Out of Mind\\" is uncharacterstic in its upbeat tone, but it somehow works. No Dan fan should be without this CD, but pick up the rest of the collection first.
B000AGTPUA|4.0|For a 21-year-old, it's been a long time since I believed in Santa. It was getting a bit stupid when I got told Santa didn't come down the chimney in our house (as we didn't have a chimney), he came in through the front door, which my parents left unlocked for him. OK then. And my mum always left out sherry for Santa, which she would then drink. And I get freaked out by these people who dress up as Santa to entertain the kids. He's not real. Does that mean I'm not going to get any presents this year? No. Cos they're sitting upstairs that's why.<br /><br />But for me, this film made me feel like I should still believe in the big Mr C, simply because of the magical, sweet ending. It meant so much, and showed how much you have grown up when you watch it. Just a simple thing like a bell ringing means you believe in Santa or you don't.<br /><br />I'm always a bit iffy around animated movies, simply because now I'm older, I notice the lip synch doesn't match etc. But I didn't notice it here. And in fact it was so well done, that I actually felt like I was watching a real movie with real actors. Also, it had all the classic 'moments' from cartoons in there. You never saw adults' faces and no one is given really proper names.<br /><br />Tom Hanks does a lot of the voices, and is the characters in this, and it's absolutely amazing how they managed to pick up his facial expressions. The animated character(s) even look like Tom Hanks. He voices these characters: Hero Boy, Father, Conductor, Hobo, Scrooge, and Santa Claus. I didn't really get the character of the Hobo, I thought he was originally going to be Santa, but he appears & disappears. That was really the only character I wasn't sure about. And Eddie Deezen also voices the know-it-all kid, who appeared in Grease, as wait for it, a geek!!! Even the kid looks pretty similar to how he did in Grease, just with lighter hair.<br /><br />There's a lot of bits relating to Robert Zemeckis' other big film Back To The Future. In a news photo of Santas on strike, their placards say they're picketing Lone Pine Mall. Hero Boy says, \\"I've wanted to do that my whole life,\\" after tugging on the trains whistle. This is the same thing Doc Brown says.<br /><br />The score is also magical, and has one of those memorable cues, that sounds so much like Edward Scissorhands, you'll actually think it was. It's a brilliant score by Alan Silvestri.<br /><br />It's a shame it's a Christmas movie, as it's so magical, it could be watched at anytime, but the obvious references to Santa etc, kinda means it can only be watched once a year. I can't wait for next year to watch it again. This will definitely be a film you'll watch year after year.re. In a news photo of Santas on strike, their placards say they're picketing Lone Pine Mall.

0790729393|2.0|Four friends from the violent New York neighborhood of Hell's Kitchen are sent to a reformatory school where they are beaten and sexually abused by guards.  Years later, two of them (Ron Eldard and Billy Crudup), now adults and full-fledged thugs, murder one of their tormentors (Kevin Bacon).  This provides an opportunity for the other two, one a public prosecutor (Brad Pitt) and the other a fledgling newspaperman (Jason Patric), to acquit their friends and bring down the other guilty guards. <br /> <br />Superficially, this is a mostly entertaining, though overlong, film.  Morally, however, the film is a mess.  Early on, it appears to be critical of the culture of violence in which these events occur.  The moral compass of the neighborhood is the scrupulously honest Father Bobby (Robert DeNiro).  Yet, when the time for payback arrives, the Mafia mentality takes over, murder is approved, and Father Bobby perjures himself to provide an alibi for \\"his boys,\\" who are guilty of worse crimes than the abuse that was committed against them.  I believe that these characters (with the exception of Father Bobby) might behave this way and a perceptive film about such choices could have been made, but such a film would require some evidence that either the characters or the filmmakers were aware of the moral complexity involved.  Instead, Father Bobby leaves the witness stand and disappears conveniently from the film, so we never see how he justifies himself.  The reunion of the four friends at the end of the film has an uninterrupted tone of triumph and happiness, without a hint of reflection, regret, or awareness that any moral compromises were made.
B000026C3T|5.0|This is the best double disc Led Zeppelin collection available.  Early Days/Latter Days, the American collection, is missing Heartbreaker, Ramble On, D'yer Mak'er, Celebration Day, Misty Mountain Hop, and The Rain Song, all of which are on here.  The only songs on that collection that are not on this one are What Is and What Should Never Be, When the Leveee Breaks, and Ten Years Gone.  Overall, this is a much better purchase.  I know diehard fans consider any retrospective collection an abomination and think that everyone should have at least the first four albums, but for those of us who just want a little bit of Led Zeppelin in our libraries, this is perfect.
B0000019PA|4.0|I love the songs, the instrumentation, the melodies, etc.  I can't stand Mangum's vocals.  \\"Caterwauling\\" is the word that comes to mind.  It makes some of the tracks unlistenable.  I only give it 4 stars instead of 3 because some of the songs are really well structured and instrumented.

B00011CZRE|5.0|Wait until you see all the sick and twisted ways psycho killer John Doe (Kevin Spacey) tortures and slowly murders those whom he deems to be guilty of one of the Se7en deadly sins (believe me, I lost all interest in \\"strap-on\\" products after this one !) <br /> <br />If you don't mind stepping over to the dark side (and I mean REALLY dark) you will enjoy following John Doe's bread crumb trail along with detectives Mills (Brad Pitt) and Somerset (Morgan Freeman), who are led from one grisly murder scene to the next over a period of a week. <br /> <br />The contrasting styles and philosophies of the two detectives make for great tension and polarity, but you will not find one single light or happy moment in this film. From beginning to end, Se7en will give you an uneasy feeling in your stomach. Which is, after all, the mark of a great noir film.
B00006AW2F|3.0|Not really a classic album, only recommended to Rolling Stones completists. Although this album is supposed to gather several rare songs (mostly b-sides) recorded at different times during their career, there is no information at all in the booklet of the CD about these songs. It's really a shame.<br /><br />Look on the internet for any information on the songs or you can take a look at Richard L. Carlton's review on Amazon.com (and other reviews as well).
B00074DXJE|5.0|The movie came out in 2004 and it shouldn't cost $50. It is $15 on DVD. Great movie though.
B000BW7QWW|5.0|I can't believe this movie popped in and out of theaters virtually unnoticed.  As a sci-fi fan this is what I crave, a solid story and deeply developed characters.<br /><br />It isn't comedy but it doesn't take itself too seriously.  The characters manage to get a laugh without being corney...okay some of them... er ... ONE of them is a little corney.<br /><br />Serenity can hold it's own with ANY Sci-Fi movie out this year, this was so good they should make a TV series or something... oops they already did.
B0002STNQ2|1.0|Found this Hardcover version on bargain section of Borders in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, grabbed it without a second thought, brought it to the hotel and started reading the first few pages... <br /> <br />Forget about Jurassic Park, Congo, etc.  This novel starts extremely slow, and it continued to be very slow for a very long time. <br /> <br />Though the nanotechnology issue is intriguing with Crichton's usual finese in researched information back up, it cannot salvage from this sinking Titanic plot.  There are a few sections which are interestingly written, but mostly mundane and boring.  I have fallen asleep many times reading just a chapter from this novel.  I always pace myself to finish reading a book to the very end, since I am not to judge it until it is totally depleted.  Well, this novel is not for me.
0803730470|5.0|This is a wonderful book which both boys and girls will love.  My daughter was five when we bought it and she still loves the story. I must admit I do also and have not tired of it.
B00080ZG10|3.0|Here's another Oscar nominee that includes a lot of big stars acting out two-dimensional cardboard characters (Leonardo di Capiro as Howard Hughes, Cate Blanchett as Kathryn Hepburn and Kate Beckinsale as Lana Turner) in situations that may or may not have actually occurred in Hughes' tumultuous life.<br /><br />The exquisite sets, lighting and production values are what make this film a keeper and entertaining. Hughes' obsession with perfection and clinical cleaningless are acted out by Leonardo with some acumen but would be only half as effective without the extravagent sets and production.<br /><br />I was very disappointed that director Martin Scorses allowed these fine, wonderful actors -- especially the marvelous Blanchett -- to act out these famous people in such minimalist fashion. Hell, all Blanchett had to do to act like Hepburn was copy her famous accent. Wasn't there more to this fascinating woman than that? Di Caprio never really escaped into the role of Hughes even though his hairdresser did what (s)he could to dress him up like famous images of the tycoon.<br /><br />The very best part of this flick is a wonderful plane crash over a swanky Los Angeles neighborhood that occurs about two-thirds of the way through the film. This is a modern work of art and one of the most successful special effect driven events since Tom Hanks flight came apart when he went to that island and lived there alone.<br /><br />I guess this movie was entertaining overall but I watched a little bitty movie most of you never heard of the next night -- \\"A Slipping Down Life\\" -- that had none of \\"The Aviator\\"'s ambition but had two wonderful performances of people much closer to real life than the cardboard characters projected here.<br /><br />So don't be all your apples into high profile, big budget Hollywood extravaganzas if you are indeed interested in seeing wonderful performances on DVD or in the theater. This is a good movie but not as good as the little filck I saw the next night, in my view.aw the next night, in my view.
B000BW7QWW|5.0|The Serenity movie is a phenomial continuation of the prematureley cancelled TV series Firefly.  Joss Whedon has a knack for evoking emotional responses and shocking turns in this creative space opera.  The character's dialog and interaction is genius and the twists and turns in the storyline leave you breathless and wanting more.
006054094X|5.0|A great history fanatic I am, upon reading this book I found Menzies is quite accurate.  Living in Asia most of my times, one can find Admiral Zhen He's relics all over places in Asia.  For non-believers, well... can't blame them for being one.  Read this book with an open mind, one can find oneself being transported back in time and issues to reminiscent.  Better still, try visiting his website.    American, Australian and other continents histories are turned upside down by menzies by this fantastic observation.  FYI: the author was a British Navy Submariner during his hey-days.  Thus, he went to most faraway and exotic places which I think not many of us have done.  Give him a credit, this is not a fantasy fiction book, it is in-fact a history non-fiction book.    His style of writing on this non-fictional book is quite good.  Though some errors in pronouncing Asian names, it is still an astounding book.    The National Geographic Channel has just started airing Admiral Zheng He's voyages this month.  In Asia, numerous exhibitions have also been held in commemoration of the ancient greatest navy of all time: Zheng He.  May I note again, Zheng He is a household name in many of Southeastern Asian regions.  He is like Christopher Columbus in the States.    Read this book, buy it or borrow it, and enjoy it!

0780021150|5.0|This picture adds another superb guerdon to the well known artistic trajectory of this visionary filmmaker, who expressed the fears and the complex and profound state of desperation, anguish and hopeless in the Weimar Republic.<br /><br />The extraordinarily well elaborated script begins with a precognitive burden: \\"Just you wait a little while/ The evil man in black will come/ With this little chopper/He will chop  you up\\". And this brutal murder of Elsie Beckman an innocent child is the undermost expression of insanity a sick mind can commit. But these terrified eyes represent a huge crowd of hungry souls that needed desperately to be fed by illusions.<br /><br />The demolishing and dreadful human chase will include not only the one hundred per cent of the police forces but besides - and here Fritz Lang goes again with his admirable genius touch - the underworld participates too due the interference of the police in the affairs of the \\"legitimate crooks\\", using the \\"Beggars Union\\" which will be hired to watch any liitle suspicious movement.<br /><br />Butt  the sublime irony has not finished yet. Once the murder is apprehended, he will be judged by a court of the underworld where members of the jury will include mothers of the murdered children. Make an instantaneous link with The Devil and Daniel Webster `s judgment and you will realize the surprising analogy.<br /><br />In casting the role of Franz Becker, the murderer, Lang sought to use the accustomed stereotype criminal, when he saw to Peter Lorre, a young Hungarian, Lang didn't think it twice and offered him the role, ignoring perhaps Lorre would play the role of his career.<br /><br />But  this character was even enhanced by the towering acting of Otto Wernicke as Inspector Lohman and Gustaf Grundgens as Schr&auml;nker in the role of underworld boss.<br /><br />The rest runs for you. And please remember the final statement if there would be still any doubt : \\"We, too, should keep closer watch on our children.\\"  Because in case you don 't, your children of the present may become children of the grave.<br /><br />This is simply a Giant film soberly filmed and loaded of such precognitive significance. As the same Fritz stated in 1971 during an interview: \\"We force the one who throws the switch or pours the poison into the room...to commit the same crime for we kill another...\\"watch on our children.\\"  Because in case you don 't, your children of the present may become children of the grave. <br /> <br />This is simply a Giant film soberly filmed and loaded of such precognitive significance.

B00005MP58|5.0|This is by light years THE best adaptation of Jane Austen's novel that exists.  Of course, no film (or mini series) is ever entirely 100% faithful to the original text, but the A&E series makes such small changes that you hardly notice...and then it flows too well for you to care.  Such can not be said of the other adaptations out there ESPECIALLY the newest one with Kiera Knightley...I've only seen the previews of this and even that makes me shudder.  The story is utterly re-written and does not have the same \\"feel\\" of the original novel.  And besides all that, Colin Firth is sooo very handsome and dashing.  Please, if you plan on seeing the new film version of this wonderful novel, then watch this mini-series first.  I guarantee you that nothing else could hold a candle to it.  Nothing!  And by the way, my boyfriend (an adamant \\"chick flick\\" hater) loves this mini series!
0131479415|5.0|This book provides insights into some common and vexing problems about how to do estimation and planning.  This book will help you to decide what to build, when to build it, and how long it will take.  Each chapter opens with entertaining quotes and the chapters are full of stories from Mike's experience, which makes this book entertaining as well as informative; the stories reenforce that the material in this book is based on experience.<br /><br />Much of the information in the book sounds obvious, but since few projects get estimation, scoping, and planning right, it's pretty clear that we all need to learn more about how to plan well.<br /><br />This book is a must have for people who are running agile teams and those who play the role of product owners. It will remain a useful reference throughout the project. Even those on non-agile teams will find the chapters on selecting and prioritizing features useful.

076790382X|4.0|This book is different from the other Bryson books I've read.  Rather than addressing a single (mostly) coherent topic, this book is a collection of newspaper columns covering a rather broad and eclectic range of topics.  He makes a number of interesting observations about the state of American society in the 1990's, especially the rise of the specialty coffee industry, and our tendancy to drive everywhere, including the gym to get exercise.  While there are some laugh-out-loud bits buried in here, I somehow was expecting it to be more amusing as whole.  In the introducton, Bryson notes these articles were originally written for a British audience and he has tried to remove \\"chunks of explication that an American would find unnecessary.\\"  I find this a bit disappointing--these bits might have been interesting, and would have provided some insights into the differences between the two countries.  Overall, this was a light and diverting book, but certainly not the best Bryson has to offer.
B000BTJDGC|4.0|I thought that this was going to be another exorcism movies that I had seen when I was younger, so I did not have high hopes when I rented this movie.  Aslo, I have seen so many bad horror or suspensiful films this year, so I thought that it would be another bad film like the others.  After watching this movie, I could not believe how great it was.  This film not only have great acting people, but the story line followed through very smoothly.  Usually, after I watch a movie I tell myself that the story lines in that movie did not make much sense, that it had too much loophole.  But, it this movie, I thought everything flowed very evenly.  Some of the reviewers said that this movie did not scared them.  I do not get very scared when watching a movie, but this one scared me, especially when they spoke about the significance of 3:00 a.m.  I kept watching my clock over and over again.  I thought that this film might be boring because it may have been written like a boring documentary, but it wasn't.  I for one very glade that I saw this film.
1582403589|5.0|I was out of the comic book reading hobby for several years, but I have to say that I was glad that i came back to reading comic books again. One of the first titles that hooked me this second time around was Kirkman's The Walking Dead for Image Comics. I have to say that its taken the current renaissance of zombie films and books and ran away with it.<br /><br />Using the same slow, shambling zombies that Romero first made popular with Night of the Living Dead and its subsequent sequels, Kirkman continues the story where Romero usually ended his films. All those times people have wondered what happened to those who survived in zombie films need not imagine anymore. Kirkman has created a believable world where the dead have risen to feast on the living, but has concentrated more on the human dynamic of survival in the face of approaching extinction.<br /><br />I won't say that the story arc collected in this first volume has little or no zombies seen, but they've taken on more as an apocalyptic prop. One can almost substitute some other type of doom in place of zombies and still get a similar effect (as was done in Brian K Vaughn's equally great series, Y: The Last Man). What Kirkman's done is show how humanity's last survivors are now constantly, desperately adapting to a familiar world through unfamiliar circumstances. Characters from the start make the sort of mistakes regular people would make when they don't know exactly everything that is happening around them. Instead of chiding these people as one reads their story, we sympathize and hope for their continued survival.<br /><br />I am hopeful that the rest of the collected trades will be equal to and maybe surpass this first story-arc. Already kirkman's done more to realizing the universe Romero created than alot of the hack filmmakers who have taken Romero's idea and cannibalized it for their own profit. I consider The Walking Dead as a must-read for anyone looking to find something different from all the costumed superhero titles.the costumed superhero titles.

B000B7BRMM|2.0|I've been a HUGE Diana Krall fan over the years  I have all - ALL her albums - my wife and I even flew to Washington D.C. to see her live.  After Live in Paris, she sounds like she's suffered a talentectomy.  This CD is lamentable in that it doesn't swing, it doesn't move, there are no tear jerkers.  Her energy is gone.  It sounds like she just walked into the studio, sang a few Christmas standards, stopped by the publicist for a quick photo shoot and went home to count her money.  The great Diana Krall seems to be diminishing into a world of pop Divas where talent is replaced with slick marketing, tawdry seduction, and high-volume sales.  Sprawled out suggestively on the cover, I should have known she was neither serious about Christmas or music.  She ought to give Russell Malone a call and get back on the right track.  Sure, this CD is fine for a Christmas party where people come together to celebrate Christmas, but it is utterly unnotable compared with the sea of \\"holiday favorites\\" from Brittney Spears and other bombshell blondes.  In short, there's no 'there' there. Pick up Swinging you a Merry Christmas by Ella Fitzgerald and listen to the master.  Krall was aspiring to this level years ago, but it seems she's cashed in her talent rather than using it to inspire us to better appreciate the gift that is Christmas.

1400077915|5.0|In her last collection of short stories, Alice Munro investigates her typical emotional terrain:  young girls defined and confined by Canadian small towns, marriages stripped bare of illusions of romance, women grappling with diminishing expectations of their lives. In few pages, Munro deftly reveals entire life spans in these eight stories, each revolving around an impulsive decision made that irrevocably alters the future. <br /> <br />In the title story, \\"Runaway,\\" a young horse trainer contemplates leaving her volatile marriage with the dubious assistance of an older woman.  As with many Munro's stories, Nature plays an ominous role as a wild force unable to be tamed.  Here, animal sacrifice is all that will quell one husband's rage. Three subsequent stories tracks choices made at the various stages of a woman's life--girl, mother, and crone.  In \\"Chance,\\" a young girl, Juliet, believes in her intellectual powers, but with sorrowful clarity she predicts its loss as she waits for the man she will soon marry:   \\"The thing that was your brightest treasure.  You don't think about it.  A loss you could not contemplate at one time, and now it becomes something you can barely remember.\\"  Fear, loneliness, and desire lead Juliet to the expected roles of wife and mother taming her individuality, waylaying and obscuring this \\"treasure.\\"  Only when her husband has died at sea and her daughter has severed communication after an escape to the wilderness, does Juliet regain her power by devoting her time to this unique gift. <br /> <br />In the final work, \\"Powers,\\" a vivacious small town girl and her neighbor, a fortune teller, reconcile the last years of their lives with lost chances at love, petty jealousies and cruelties, and the fragility of memory that adjusts to make the burdens of wrongheaded choices easier to bear.   When this story ends, the mind too has gone wild as both women hover between knowing and not knowing what has become of those they love.   The subtletyof this discomfort highlights the foreboding quality of all of Munro's work:  \\"But deep in that moment some instability is waiting that Nancy is determined to ignore.\\"  This, just before a woman is lead gently to death.  Each of these stories shows Munro at her \\"Runaway\\" best. <br />
B000AP04FG|5.0|This movie belongs in the same category as titles like, Taxi, The Godfather, Gone With the Wind, and Citizen Kane. It is simply cinematic masterpiece. Brad Pitt's role reminds one of the superb acting that Joe Pesci did in Goodfellas. This movie is definetely one of the top ten movies of all time.
B00005JKGK|5.0|It's about this woman who wants to find her mother's sisters,but unfortunatly,she dies,before she sees them 1 last time.They were separated because of the war.They are twins. I didn't understand the war parts.
B000A59PMO|5.0|Kristen Bell completely shines as the witty, wise-ass but warm, title sleuth...This vastly improves on the Buffy template. Because VM's character and background are so well-developed, we are able to see where the rough edges of her persona come from.  <br /> <br />Nifty job too, incorporating the over-arching series plot into the self-contained case each ep features...Points too, to Enrico Culati (sic?) as Veronica's Dad - he really nails the hurt and pride his character is forced to feel resulting from the bad situation he finds himself in... <br /> <br />And finally, excellent use of music - way better than Buffy...(in fact the music scenes in Buffy always reminded me of when they tried to feature rock bands in, I dunno, Mannix, or something - more like your Dad's idea of indie music...) In fact, Spoon are due to perform in an upcoming episode, covering E.Costello's Veronica. How tasty is that?
B00005NB0H|4.0|I love the Who and own all of their records and many bootlegs as well. As great a live album as this is, it can't be said that this was a night when the Who were \\"on\\". On the good quality bootlegs you can hear how great a band they really were. The sound on LAL lacks depth and they try to get everything right because it was being recorded for a live release. What Pete Townshend and Roger Daltrey should do is start releasing the unreleased live shows from the sixties and the seventies. This is what Who fans really want, live material from 1969 thru 1975 when Keith Moon was still alive. Listen to the Young Vic material on the re-release of Who's Next and you will see what I mean. Recorded when they were still rehearsing to take Who's Next on the road, they sound great even though the material was new and they were still trying to work out a new show after Tommy had been played to death on the road. What should be released is Woodstock, Tanglewood, Metropolitan Opera House and as many concerts as possible from the Who's Next tours of 1971-1972. (Why Townshend does not do this is a mystery to me. On his website he sells Who shows from the 1990's thru 2004. But it's not really \\"The Who\\". He would sell 10 times as many CD's if he released the live shows with Keith Moon.) Live at Leeds and Isle of Wight good as they are compared to other live albums don't really convey what the Who were capable of live.
B000AP04FG|2.0|With Mr. and Mrs. Smith, Hollywood proves once again that they think moviegoers are all morons.  This boring, ridiculous movie offers nothing other than two attractive people to look at.  In an age where smart, stylish spy films like Mission: Impossible and the Bourne Identity have added flair to a tired old genre, Mr. and Mrs. Smith takes viewers back to the 1980s when the most ridiculous of the James Bond movies were fashionable.  This film is so poorly written and badly directed that I couldn't find anything positive about it.  Despite bullets flying and cars exploding, I found myself falling asleep over and over again.  This is nothing but a rehash of everything you saw in the old cheesy action films of 20 years ago with nothing fresh or interesting added at all.
B000BTC5LW|5.0|I don't know if this information in amazon dot com is true or false.It seems to me that PULSE will never be released again. Does someone know somethin about it?Bye
1573223026|2.0|I loved High Fidelity and \\"About a boy\\" but did not enjoy \\"How to be good\\" or this latest effort \\"A long way down\\" as it seems to stray away from his strengths as an author which are basically describing how weak and useless males are in a some hilarious context. The characters are weak and it's really hard to believe at any level that they want to commit sucide. Jess is incredibly annoying and although that was the intention her character is simply too much. There are a few funny moments but they are few and far between. It's sometimes hard to figure out if this is a comedy or a trajedy and doesn't really work at either level. Not his best work in any case
B00005JO1Y|2.0|I am suprised to see so many positive reviews below! Like the rest, I waited in great anticipation for this film and wanted to like it so badly that I overlooked the first, oh, one or two hundred flaws, boredom spells, bad scripting and bad acting. But enough is enough, people. Perhaps Jackson's had one too many pats on the back for his near-perfect LOTR trilogy.<br /><br />Ok. So what went wrong?<br /><br />Like everyone else who dared to write a negative review, I must complain about the length. I think Jackson forgot that the reason his trilogy merited three hours a piece was because there was SOMETHING HAPPENING! In this, we have way too many extended close-ups of characters no one bothered to develop and therefore for whom we care very little - if at all. The Island scene left me completely exhausted. Every time they conquered one monster, cliff or maniacal tribe member, lo and behold, the camera turns and OH NO! yet another dreadful beast! Luckily, the people on the ship had been drinking their milk, eating their spinach, popping their steroids or otherwise brushing up on their superhuman powers. Nimbly they race under the feet of a dinasour stampede(thank gosh all the main characters made it!), they fall twenty feet, landing on their backs only to get up and ward off hundreds of inflated insects. They can swim, jump, wrestle and rock climb with the best of them. And good thing that Watts is made of plado or puddy or some other indestructable material - otherwise, her neck would have snapped with the first(of about twenty million) violent yanks from The Kongster.<br /><br />And while we are speaking of Miss Watts! I think Clinique or Avon funded a major portion of this movie, because at least 1/3 of it was devoted to Watts' always-well-made-up eyes. Yes, they are pretty. Yes, they express good emotion. But by golly we can only watch those big blue eyes water so many times!<br /><br />Which leads me to the acting. Unlike the other negative reviews(many of which were quite good and full of many solid points), I didn't think the acting was that bad. I felt like the direction made it very hard on the actors to do anything but what they did. Overact a little. Underdevelop their characters ALOT. Give meaningful stares that mean nothing. Etc. Adrien is great - I'm a fan of anything he does and he really did well for what he was given. Watts did alright, the sailors did alright. Colin Hanks was great to watch - I'm sure he hates to hear it, but he's a minature Tom. And Jack Black. Again, unlike the other negative reviewers, I thought he did a very good job switching to a slightly more serious role. He made me like him at the start, then slowly begin to disaprove of him, then subtley merge into a pretty solid hatred for his character. Nice job. However, the casts' attempt to lift the film was swallowed up by scenes that dragged forever, nonexistant dialogue, ornate sets and computer graphics, computer graphics and more computer graphics.<br /><br />Disapointing as this hyped up movie was, we must remember that Jackson really is pretty new on the scene. Should he have known better? Yes. Was he a little jacked up by his own image? Sure, but we're to blame because of our generous worshiping of his Ring. Are people still going to overlook this let down and make themselves love the movie for sake of a higher cause? Absolutely.<br /><br />But what can I say? Even though this movie doesn't half live up to what it promised to be, it was a decent action flick with too much running time. The graphics were great. The actors truly tried. And perhaps Jackson got that out of his system and will go back to making movies that stand above the rest... yeah right, whatever.<br /><br />So two stars.ny of which were quite good and full of many solid points), I didn't think the acting was that bad.

B0008JIJ2E|5.0|It goes without saying that \\"The Karate Kid\\" is an awesome movie all by itself. Nevertheless, the extras on this DVD are just what \\"special features\\" should be -- windows into the heart and soul of the film, its characters, and its creators.  They make this great movie even better. <br /> <br />Mr. Miyagi was the sensei and mentor I always wished I'd had. So when I heard that Pat Morita had died, it broke my heart. Fortunately, just months before he passed away, Pat recorded a commentary track for this Special Edition DVD, along with Ralph Macchio and the film's writer and director. Just hearing his insights into Miyagi's character and the relationship between Daniel and Miyagi is well worth the price of admission. <br /> <br />There are also a number of interesting and entertaining mini-documentaries, like \\"The Way of the Karate Kid,\\" featuring William Zabka (Johnny Lawrence), Martin Cove (Kreese, the Cobra Kai sensei), and Pat E. Johnson, the film's martial arts choreographer (who also played the tournament referee for the final showdown between Johnny and Daniel). <br /> <br />Buy this DVD. You'll love it. It's disposable income well spent.
0060976624|5.0|A relative gave me this book and said it was sure to entertain, I wasn't disappointed.  The book is a satire of the tobacco industry that goes even beyond what I thought was possible to promote tobacco.  Although I don't smoke, the people peddling tobacco are unique? individuals that have quite a gift? for promoting something so toxic to the human body.  Although the subject is appalling, I was laughing my head off at the outrageous interpretations of medical studies and clever rebuttals the tobacco spokesman came up with to counter the media and medical community.  In a dark way, it really is a funny book....
B00006690G|5.0|this is eminem's best cd by far. his first two lps he was just joking around and didn't care about anything. this time around, hes much more real, and shows more emotion. his lyrics have improved and his production is getting better. eminem is one of the best rappers regardless of race. buy this cd if you like hip hop.
B00030EIY6|5.0|Philips has hit the top specs with this DVD: the picture resolution and sound are so good, clear and accurate they make me feel as though I'm in Vienna, live at this January 1, 1992 concert of the Vienna Philharmonic conducted by Carlos Kleiber (1930-2004).  This is one of Kleiber's later rare TV appearances, and he is firmly in control of the Vienna Philharmonic: with minimal gestures, he conjures the needed music from the VPO musicians, be it Nicolai, Johann Strauss Jr. or Sr. or others on this program.  Still, the flow of the music is natural and Kleiber's leadership never becomes invasive or  \\"masterful,\\" as in say Herbert von Karajan's Tchaikovsky Symphony recordings (DG CDs).  Incidentally, Karajan's NEW YEARS CONCERT FROM VIENNA (Sony DVD) is excellent in every respect, and not masterful at all, as his Tchaikovsky was.<br /><br />The audience is large and appreciative, but never intrusive into my enjoyment of this DVD.  Kleiber conducts a perky \\"Overture to the Merry Wives of Windsor\\" (Otto Nicolai) to begin the program, and the following selection of Waltzes and Polkas by the Strauss family all give much enjoyment.  Kleiber senses the perfect tempo and phrasing for each selection.  I have heard many of the New Years Concerts, and consider this (along with Kleiber's 1989 concert) one of the best ones.<br /><br />I hope you enjoy this as much as I do.  My only regret is that Carlos Kleiber is no longer living, and will not conduct the New Years - or any other - concerts, in the future.
B000002ARV|5.0|This is one of the finest rock albums to come out of the late 60's, early 70's era, and for that matter, any other era.  I, too, saw Winters And on tour in, I believe, 1970, and was floored when Johnny cooked on the guitar and absolutely astonished to find out that his side-man was no other than the boy from the McCoys, Rick Derringer.  He had most definately been practicing since \\"Sloopy\\".  As for Derringers' songs, Hootchie-Koo, Still Alive and Cheap Tequilla, I love em all and especially when played by Johnny and And.  As for the length of the album, 12 songs seems fair and is, in fact, 2 songs more than the original album on vinyl.  I still remember playing this one for the first time some 35 years ago.  That, to me, says a whole lot about this album and, as a matter of fact, I'm buying a new one today from Amazon to replace my most recent worn-out cd copy.
B000BW7QWW|5.0|Why is it a good movie? <br />----------------------- <br />* a lot of the Firefly mythos is included (civil war, Alliance, Reavers, outer planets) <br />* your favorite Firefly characters are the stars of the movie <br />* some loose ends are tied, some secrets are revealed <br />* lots of action and drama both in space and on the ground <br />* maintains its sense of humor <br />* nicely done special effects that flow with the story <br />* great translation to the big screen while maintaining a reasonable budget <br />* almost 2 hours run-time <br /> <br />For those not familiar with Serenity/Firefly, you should first watch the DVD set of \\"Firefly\\" - the TV series. It includes the back story of all the characters and movie. <br /> <br />And lastly, Firefly/Serenity deserves a return to TV, whether it is as a weekly TV series or in an annual mini-series format or perhaps in TV or silver screen movies. <br /> <br />The DVD set  <br />---------------------- <br />* The movie and the bonus features are all in one (1) DVD disc <br /> <br />DVD bonus features <br />------------------ <br />* 15 minutes of Deleted/Extended scenes (9 scenes total). Favorite quote at the end of the last scene: \\"What a whiner!\\" <br />* 6 minutes of funny Outtakes <br />The next four features include on-screen appearances by Joss Whedon: <br />* 10 minutes of \\"Relighting the Firefly\\". The story of going from (unfairly) cancelled TV show to a big screen movie. This is my favorite of all the DVD bonus features. <br />* 6 1/2 minutes: \\"What's inside a Firefly\\" - various tidbits about the movie/show <br />* 4 1/2 minutes: \\"Future history - Story of the Earth that was\\" - tying Firefly/Serenity to the history of the Earth. Also explanation of why they occassionally speak in Chinese (for those who don't already know). <br />* 4 minute \\"Joss Whedon\\" introduction to Firefly/Serenity. This was recorded a while back before he grew facial hair. <br />* And of course, the customary director's commentaryaudio track by Joss Whedon
B000BW7QWW|5.0|I'm not going to go deep into plot points or how great the story is, how truly involving and exciting the action sequences are, how sublime the performances are, how masterful the dialogue is. You know why? Because I hate Joss Whedon. He has done more to make me cry man-tears than any other genre creator has ever done. He has been responsible for more great episodes of TV than just about any other genre creator I know of. This film is just another example of how much I hate him. I don't hate him because he's good. I hate him because he's GREAT!!!! I want just a little of his talent... maybe I'll ask Santa...<br /><br />Anyway, as another reviewer here stated, it is HIGHLY recommended that you see the show first not so much because of the plot, but for the characters to grow on you. Buy the DVD set of the series, then go out and get the film. You can't stop the signal.
B000002C1W|4.0|This album polarize most Pink Floyd fans, I really don't understand why. This is pure Floyd, and while it's true that is not on the level of Dark Side, Wish You Where Here or Animals, much of the music in the album is wonderful. Without R. waters the band lost much of the conceptual views of the past, but here Music is what is all about, not lyrics, but nevertheless THERE IS a clear concept in this album, specifically side 2 from Yet Another Movie. Some say that this is a Gilmour solo album, I don't agree; just listen to About Face, Gilmour's solo effort before this album, and you will notice the difference, this is a Pink Floyd album in its own right; songs like Sorrow, Yet Another Movie and On the Turning Away are as good as any classic Floyd song. So don't pay attention to fans that think that Roger Waters IS Pink Floyd, they are so wrong as the ones that once thought that Syd Barret was Pink Floyd. Pink Floyd is (or was?) a band that explored all its possible incarnations, from psychedelia and space jams to heavenly crafted rock that then converted in songs of angst, paranoia and dispair. This album just shows another excellent side of the band and a refresh from the previous album that was way too heavy and personal -but very good anyway, as all Floyd. And to anyone who says that there are outside musicians, I say: in The Final Cut, there was no Richard Wright to play keyboards, he was repaced by two guys and Nick Mason did not play drums in one song, he was replaced by other two guys; nobody complains about it, so why complain here?
B000A6T1JU|2.0|Look, to sum up this debacle: the extra features have an EXTENDED discussion of how hard it was to get the last shot with the sun coming up on the beach and the Warriors walking off into the distance...and that shot is SCREWED by the new comic book nonsense, which ends with a quick freeze-frame devolving into a stupid comic book frame...they go on and on about it, and it ain't even in this version of the film!?!?!! <br /> <br />Oh, and Remar's priceless reaction to the Baseball Furies is screwed up by Hill's comic book \\"improvements\\", too... <br /> <br />But then I think all the deleted scenes that were reinserted into the television cut back in the day, to make it longer, are lame and pointless too, which some here don't agree with... <br /> <br />Suffice to say, the theatrical release was King and always shall be.  Luckily, I have it.  I'm sellin' this, although it was nice to see the documentaries (once)...
B0009I7NNA|5.0|I take back all my reviews, except Seemless.  This C.D. blew me away.  And I did not want to like this album.  Very rarely, especially recently, can I get into a band from the mainstream music scene.  I am all about stoner, sludge, doom, and grunge, but this album hit me.  YEAH, it can be cheesy, but in the way Faith No More, GnR, and STP can be cheesy (in a good way).  Just a fun album to listen to.  In fact, this band has given me faith in mainstream music again.
B000001ELR|3.0|Being a Kiss fan my whole life and my first album that I bought a Kiss album I find this album pretty crummy. <br /> <br />Creatures of the night is a rocking tune to start off with. Ilove it loud is sort of a Kiss Anthem but the rest is typical Kiss including the power ballad I still love you. <br /> <br />I own this cd but I bought it used and would never pay full price for it.
B00008J4P5|5.0|One of the only good bands that came after the 70's. I can't approve of any music nowadays because it is so synthesized and fake and \\"popular\\" that I throw up when ever I see the letters MTV when    flipping through the channels. The White Stripes are REAL. You can tell when an album stinks when you get sick of it in a month. That is why Hendrix, Beatles, Zeppilin, and so many others are legends. You can put the White Stripes on that list. They WILL BE on that list. Unless of course pop culture has anything to say about it.  Heck, if pop culture has anything to say about, John Lennon will be replaced by P. Diddy, and in that case, I will be moving to a place where the word \\"POP\\" does not exist.
B000001DYJ|5.0|Kiss Alive III is by far the best for sound quaity and song seletion ! <br /> <br />A great selection of songs and a rocking show ! <br /> <br />Buy the cd and the DVD !
B00064ADR0|5.0|\\"It's my own fault\\" on the live disc may be the best 12 minutes of electric blues guitar I've ever heard. It seems blues guitarists are everywhere these days, but at his peak - which just happens to have been around the time he was playing the Royal Albert Hall in April 1971 - Johnny was in a league of his own. No player today I'm aware of comes even close. The 2nd Winter CD is great also, as is the rest of the live disc. Highly recommended.
B000002J09|2.0|Withe the release of Led Zepelin IV the mighty Zep grew into this so called \\"Gods of Rock\\" legend. <br /> <br />This is the only CD by Zep I have ever owned or will own.Anything else by this band is a waste of money. I prefer to listen to Robert Plant solo. Jimmy Page is a highly overrated guitarist and has very little technical talent at all and many other guitarists blow him away. <br /> <br />Buy this cd and save your money on the rest of the Zep CDS .
B00005JNTX|1.0|Okay, so I have to be honest.  Maybe I can't really review this film.<br /><br />I have sat through a lot of bad films and I usually make a point of not walking out but this is the first film I ever walked out on.  I do not object to the violence.  What bothered me about this film is that when characters basically cannot be injured by weapons, I don't care what happens anymore.  I like films where the appearance of a weapon makes me tense.  In this film characters can get shot repeatedly without being killed, so the appearance of a gun no longer becomes thrilling.<br /><br />My point is that, ironically, the excessive violence of this film made it one of the most boring films that I've ever watched.
B00003CXA2|5.0|Really, not a bad film at all. The movie is to long in some places. we all are slow and mistunderstood sometimes, and I think that people should stop judging us. It is an insult to us less-fortunate that these morons jack asses can use us as escape goats. and we should not be the ones to blame for other's insane mistakes, and there is no reason for it. so I think that this movie depicts some of the elimants of humanity and hope for me for you, for all people. so my rating is and will be a 5***** rating for this film. Forrest Gump KICKED BUTT. It's almost like we are being treated like kings for the moment, and then being treated like crap. it's basically par-from the course as far as I am consernd.
B000AMJDHY|1.0|1.5/10 stars <br /> <br />Ten years ago, who would've guessed that emo would usurp punk as the genre du jour for angst-ridden teens. By the late 1990s, most fans of the genre's second wave were abandoning it. Many of the best bands had split up, while the handful that were left were moving toward a more straightforward pop rock sound. But just as it appeared over, the scene suddenly exploded, giving birth to an entire new generation of slick, generic, mall-store neo-emo. It's like the bartender yelled last call, the house lights came on, and then at the last minute, he decided to keep the club open all night serving Cokes. So now, 20 years after Rites of Spring's only full-length album was released, we've arrived at Panic! at the Disco's A Fever You Can't Sweat Out. <br /> <br />Where does one begin to describe this steaming pile of garbage? You've already seen the ridiculous name, so let's try a few of song titles on for size. Track two is called \\"The Only Difference Between Martyrdom and Suicide Is Press Coverage\\", and it's followed by \\"London Beckoned Songs About Money Written By Machines\\". If those don't quite do it for you, check out \\"I Write Sins Not Tragedies\\", or my personal favorite, \\"Lying Is the Most Fun a Girl Can Have Without Taking Her Clothes Off\\". <br /> <br />But of course, the asinine song titles and the moronic band name have nothing on the actual songs. The usual guitar, bass, and drums are augmented by drum machine beats and synths that would be more at home blaring over the P.A. at your local gym than in anything one might consider enjoyable music. The production, handled by Matt Squire, a guy who is certainly no stranger to radio-friendly emo, is slick and polished. Vocalist Brendon Urie's impassioned, warbling vocals are so strained it's as if he might just burst into tears at any moment. This poor guy's heart must get broken on a daily basis or something. And if it wasn't bad enough, someone convinced him to add some fancy effects on a trackor two that make it sound like someone is lightly karate chopping him across the throat while he sings. <br /> <br />The lyrics are just the sort of vague teen heartache you'd expect. In \\"Camisado\\", Urie croons, \\"You're a regular decorated emergency/ The bruises and contusions will remind you what you did when you wake,\\" sliding up to a falsetto while keyboards shimmer behind him. In \\"Time to Dance\\", which utilizes some sort of poorly realized gun-as-a-camera metaphor, he belts out, \\"When I say shotgun, you say wedding/ Shotgun/ Wedding\\", and \\"Give me envy/ Give me malice/ Give me attention/ Give me a break.\\" Yeah, you and me both, kid.  <br /> <br />It's sad that this is what emo has become. The genre's always had some irritating characteristics, but this newest batch of heartbroken heartthrobs has managed to build their careers solely out of those characteristics. The whining, the emotionally exposed lyrics, and the passionate choruses are there, but there's no sincerity, creativity, or originality. [1.5/10 stars] <br /> <br />-Cory D. Byrom, November 29, 2005, Pitchfork Media <br />
B000002UB3|5.0|The Beatles are the best rock band that ever was...and ever will be.    The fab four's 1969 album Abbey Road, which was their last album released while they were still together (1970's Let It Be was released after The Beatles' official break up), is an outstanding collection of some of the band's greatest moments in rock history. It's flawless, geniune, and brilliant in every right.    The list of songs includes one of John Lennon's best contributions to the Beatles back catalogue Come Together, George Harrison's irresistably beautiful Here Comes The Sun and Something, Paul McCartney's artistic vision on She Came in Through the Bathroom Window, Golden Slumbers, Carry That Weight, and The End (which features the most positive lyric ever put on tape \\"...and in the end, the love you take is equal to the love you make\\"). The album also features some recording session bits and pieces put together to form a puzzle that is listenable as it is overwhelmingly enjoyable: Lennon's bluesy rocker I Want You (She's So Heavy), which stands alone as the most underrated Beatles rock jam ever, Mean Mr. Mustard, and Polythene Pam; Paul's 50's inspired Oh Darling!; Ringo's overlooked classic Octopus's Garden, and the essential and harmonious Lennon penned number Because.    It's hard to point out the best Beatles record, but Abbey Road is easily considered a contender!    Recommended    A
0895260131|5.0|I find this book throughly researched and well documented. Robert Spencer throws the ball back in the face of Arabian historians. Another book that muslim apologist and muslims do not want you to read. Now muslims and their apologist want to make it look like that no books make Christianity look bad, but they obviously have not read these books and if they have, have not mentioned it. The Crusades Through Arab Eyes by Amin Mallouf, which portrays the Crusaders as savages will not dispute this book. Nor this one by Jessica Stern, Terror In The Name of God:Why Religious Militants Kill? Which shows where she interviewed not only muslim terrorists but Christian terrorists as well, would probably not dispute this. How about Sir Ridley Scott's Crusades flick, Kingdom of Heaven which also portrays the Crusaders as aggressors against Muslims. People like Bill Clinton, Amin Mallouf would give high ratings for. And all you muslim apologist, and you know who you are, nor the muslims who are disputing this book as false would, and you know who you are would dispute this movie. <br /> <br />Jonathan Riley-Smith, author of A Short History of the Crusades and one of the leading historians of the period, called the movie \\"rubbish\\", but muslims and their apologists would disagree. Spencer shows how the muslim aggression into Christian lands started in 635, with the invasion of Damascus. Muslims invaded Christian lands such as Egypt, Antioch, and went into Europe pillaging christian towns, slaughtering christians unless they converted to Islam, and that muslims burned down churches, murdered monks and defiled nuns. But you will not hear these people make a mention of that. All 450 yrs before Pope Urban II called for the Crusades in 1095 as a defensive action to muslim aggression. <br /> <br />How christians who were enslaved who lived under muslims rule were treated, given dhimmi status. How they had to bow their head to the tax collector, while the collector can hold him by the beard and slap him on both cheeks. How they were not allowed to have their festivals as they were allowed in Christian lands. How they were forced to wear certain colors, and how they had to step aside when muslims walked on the same side as them. While Biblical verses shows war and violence, it does not literally mean that like the quran does. Only if you were of certain tribes. Not just anyone as in the Quran.  <br /> <br />Muslims will not show you the verses in the Quran that speak of hate and violence like Surah 8:60-strike terror into their hearts,Surah 47:4-Smite the necks of the disbeleivers, Surah 4:89 Kill those who turn their backs to Islam. Surah 5:51-take not as friends Christians and Jews. These verses are not shown.Timothy Mcvey and Eric Rudolph when committing their atrocities did not by no means follow the verses in the Bible,like Osama bin Laden or Al-Zaqawri follow verses in their Quran and use it to justity their atrocities against innocent ppl.  <br /> <br />People who dispute this as \\"rubbish\\" live in a bubble. Break that bubble. Spencer depicts both sides. People need to wake up. Terrorism is more predominate in Islam than in Christianity. ACTION SPEAK LOUDER THAN WORDS!! The truth hurts but it is still the truth.
B00005V3Z4|4.0|I have never been a huge fan of \\"Donnie Darko\\" as a science fiction story, which is how it was intended by writer/director Richard Kelly. The vague storytelling masks the gaps in logic and the budgetary constraints that did not allow them to show things more convincingly (also Kelly needed more experience before he tackled a project of this scope). However, fans have embraced this failing as the film's strength and have used the open-ended structure to mold the thing into something that fits their own individual agendas.    By now most everyone knows that early in the film the world diverges into a tangent universe, a situation that must be remedied in 28 days or the normal universe will end. Donnie has been selected by some undisclosed guardian to bring the tangent and primary universes back into alignment. He is given some superhuman powers for this task but only a few clues about what must be done. Searching for answers (mostly about time travel) during the day and performing sleepwalking pranks by night (an inefficient way to bring about certain vaguely tangential events), he semi-cluelessly moves forward toward the deadline. At last he figures out that he must send an \\"artifact\\" (a jet engine) back from the tangent universe to the normal universe. He seemingly knows that doing so will result in his death in the normal universe but he selflessly performs the task and restores things to a stable balance.    This is not as silly and contrived as it sounds but it does have some major issues that must be ignored if one is to really embrace the film. It also lacks useful philosophical depth and is just a teen movie with some intriguing thoughts about time travel.    But \\"Donnie Darko\\" becomes extraordinary when viewed instead as an allegorical story about free will versus destiny. It is basically a twisted remake of Frank Capra's \\"It's a Wonderful Life\\", with Donnie a 1988 version of George Bailey and Frank his guardian angel. Instead of being given a chance to see what the world would be like if he had not been born, Donnie is given the chance to see how his continued existence would alter events. For George Bailey the experience was full of positive revelations, for Donnie it is the opposite.    To go with this unintended interpretation you just dismiss the whole thing about tangent universes. Instead Donnie dies at the beginning of the story by a random event (a jet engine falls off a plane passing over his house)over which he has no control. Since he is not essential to the event, he is given a chance to experience an additional 28 days of life to see the effects of his remaining alive and then choose between the two alternate futures. But he is also given the ability to actually see the force fields that draw everyone toward their destinies and finds himself powerless to resist such manipulation. Ultimately he makes his first \\"free choice\\" and elects his original death.    \\"Heathers\\" was a major influence on Kelly and \\"Donnie Darko\\" has that same sedated tone, with characters generally under-reacting to absurdly extreme developments. As in that film parents are not the problem, rather it is kids being incredibly (but believably) cruel to each other.    The cast is solid although avoiding Drew Barrymore and Patrick Swayze is normally a good idea. Jake Gyllenhaal is excellent and it is nice that his actual sister Maggie plays his film sister. Unfortunately both Maggie and Jena Malone are wasted in unchallenging roles with minimal screen time.    Then again, what do I know? I'm only a child.
B00005JO9J|5.0|I have fallen love with this TV show.  I've dragged my mum into watching it, along with most of my aunts and my grandmother.  It's a hit with all ages.  When I saw commercials for it, I thought, hm...something different, so I decided to watch it.  Now I'm addicted.  I haven't missed one episode, it's just that good.  The relationships between all the interns make the show interesting.  You never want to miss a show, because you want to keep up with the characters.
0553801503|4.0|This one was a b@&%$ !  That's what George r.r. Martin said in the acknowledgments of this book, and he was right.  At points in this book, i felt as if i wanted to burn it, other times I was very much intrigued by it, yet by the time i finished it I realized that it was worth reading for two reasons:  it refreshed my memory of the other three books and set the stage for the next one.  This felt more like a skeleton, and the next book will fill in the details, and i think this book will come together nicely after reading the next one.  At least that is the hope.  Peace be with you always!
6304806418|5.0|Evita started as a concept album.  Then Harold Prince staged the album in London with album star Elaine Paige. Evita premiered on Broadway in 1979 with Patti LuPone.  This made overnight stars of not only Paige and LuPone and Mandy Patinkin but Andrew Lloyd Webber. <br /> <br />Since then it has become a Hollywood Jonah.  Everyone from Barbra Streisand to Bette Middler to Meryl Streep have been cast in (or mentioned for) the lead and as many top line directors including Oliver Stone have been attached.  Disney finally bought the rights for Maddona and the film died.  A decade passed and finally everything falls in place including Maddona.  I am not a big fan of Maddona but she can sing, she is Latino and she is not too old to play Eva Peron. <br /> <br />This film came together with near perfection.  The film went back to the concept album.  The only major changes were Eva now sings the best song in the score \\"Another Suitcase in Another Hall\\" and for continuity some of Che's songs were assigned to others (in the musical Che performed many minor characters.   <br /> <br />Madonna was brilliant as Eva but the find was Antonio Banderas as Che.  No one knew that he could sing!  The only miscasting is Jonathan Pryce as Juan Peron but this is a minor flaw.   <br /> <br />For most of the 80's and 90's, musicals have been disasters.  The main reason is directors chosen have no musical experience (John Huston did Annie and Richard Attenborough did A Chorus Line).  For Evita, Alan Parker was chosen.  Parker scored a triumph for the musical Fame in 1980.  Parker's choices were perfection, this is a crisp and clean film.  The film could have been overly sentimental or cloying but Parker chose the straight path, tell the story and let the emotion evolve from the story. <br /> <br />If you liked the musical, you will love the movie.  If you don't hate Madonna, you'll love the movie.  If you like great film making, you'll love the movie.  <br /> <br />DVD EXTRAS: None
006441034X|5.0|I bought this book after watching Hayao Miyazaki's animated version, and I absolutely adore it!  Each character is distinct and likeable, and the plot offers a very different twist to a modern-day fantasy tale.  After reading other (what I would call) flat fantasy series like 'Lemony Snicket' and 'Narnia' (both of which I don't find compare to the charm of 'Harry Potter'), 'Howl's Moving Castle' is a welcome relief that offers substance with its story - the magic itself lies in the wonderful characters.  I only wish there was more! <br />After reading 'Howl's Moving Castle' I am definately going to pick up any and all other books by this author.  Here's hoping to Sophie & Howl popping up in future novels.
0553801503|5.0|Clearly, it was a mistake to tell the whole story for half the characters instead of half the story for all the characters. However, it's still an incredibly good book. Others have complained about the excess attention to Brienne, but I enjoyed those chapters along with the rest. If you liked the first three books in the series, this one is in the same league (probably closer to the second in terms of readability).
B0007TKNL0|5.0|First things first, I find it interesting that many \\"professional\\" film critics wrote such scathing reviews about this film adaptation of this classic musical when most theatre-goers loved the film. Rarely do I see audience members applaud before and after the film. Rarely, do I even see the majority of the audience sit through the entire credits, just to listen to Andrew Lloyd Webber's haunting score while composing themselves after a heart-wrenching ending. The acting is topnotch. I prefer Gerard Butler's acting take and voice over Michael Crawford's any day of the week. I mean, for the past year, I have heard much complaining about who was cast in the title role. But let's face the facts. Michael Crawford is an aging man. You didn't think he would sing the Phantom forever....did you? Now I agree that Crawford did an incredible job, and set a high bar for everyone that would play the phantom in the future. I am going to put this rather bluntly, what happens when Crawford is gone? Should we place the scores in a sealed vault to be forgotten because we don't feel anyone will ever perform the role to Crawford's standards? Need I say more.....on with the review... <br /> Gerard Butler's Phantom has emotion and so does his singing voice........while Crawford went for beauty but lacked emotion. Butler's acting is phenomenal and not getting enough credit....for instance: The scene on the rooftop when he picks up the rose that Christine dropped. The emotion in his voice and on his face is painwrenching to deal with. His sense of betrayal and loss of Christine is deeply felt. And then his desire for revenge as he finishes the song while climbing the corner statue on the roof while the director uses a close up shot and then pulls away into the sky.........both the actor and director made that scene so wonderful, not to mention the beauty of the snowcovered rooftop with more snow falling. And then in the cavern at the end of the movie, Butler's raw emotion creates a tensionfilled final scene. For that matter all 3 actors do a great job of expressing the anguish of the catch-22 situation. Emmy Rossum commanded attention from her opening number! Simply put, she was wonderful and I give her a well deserved A+. If you watch her eyes closely, you can really see that she is feeling everything in the right moment. She believes that she is Christine, and in love with two completely different entities. Again, I cannot see anything wrong with her performance. Of all of the Raouls I have heard, Patrick Wilson easily takes first place....by a landslide. Guess you could figure out his rating. He sang very smoothly and without error. Even his acting was impressive...Webber definitely got it right.  Wilson and Rossum seem to have a very good chemistry with the acting as well as a beautiful blend of voices.....though at times, he does seem to let the soprano out do him on some of the higher notes. But thats okay....people go to an opera to see the soprano anyways. I also have to say that I liked the fact that they added a little bit more character to Madame Giry (Miranda Richardson). She explains to Raoul how she came across a boy being beaten by a circus leader. Previously, the earliest indications of who the phantom....or rather, why the phantam is, was during the finale events. It allows the audience to feel sypathetic to a character who seems to be nothing more than a beast stalking his prey....when infact he is just like any of us...at least on the inside. <br /> For those of you who are seasoned fans of the stage production, you will enjoy this new interpretation. I find it a nice compliment to the stage show because the movie incorporates the history of the Phantom and allows the audience a glimpse of the Phantom's reaction during scenes, such as \\"All I Ask of You\\". The increased screen time that the Phantom receives gives even a greater connection to this tragic character. <br /> For those experiencing this musical for the first-time, you'rein for a treat! The music of Phantom is beautiful and soulful. Accompany that with a visual feast and a stunning cast, this film is indeed Oscar-worthy. The music and story of Phantom has captured the hearts and imagination of theatre-goers for almost two decades now. It has endured a lot of harsh criticism before, but still remains to touch everyone that sees it. By withstanding the test of time, \\"The Phantom of the Opera\\" has provided itself the best review that anyone can bestow upon it. i hope this review helps you in whatever way possible.... <br />
B00097DXZS|1.0|I am studying for a mid-term exam and decide to listen to my new Santana CD. I pop it into my PC CD player, click Yes and start to play the music. Take a break - wonder what Amazon reviews has to say about the album. I learn that I just installed a rootkit on my computer that opens my computer up to security vulnerabilities and also transmits information to Sony music servers. Well, I'll have to uninstall it - WRONG. There was no uninstaller provided with the installation and the uninstaller provided at the software company, SunnComm, will open my computer up to more vulnerabilities. After looking at the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) web site and catching up on news and lawsuits regarding this issue, I don't quite know what to do about getting rid of this hassle. How rude of Sony and BMG. If this is what it takes to protect intellectual rights, I'll have to make sure that I don't support those artists and companies. <br /> <br />By the way, the music on the CD is not so great either. <br /> <br />If I could give this CD zero (or negative) stars, I would.
0060512806|5.0|Don't be turned off if you're not a science fiction fan.  This book is both intelligent and hilarious.  I do agree with other reviewers however, in that male readers may find it more enjoyable, due to the dearth of interesting female characters and testocentric humor.  If you are interested in computers, cryptography, engineering in general, and are looking for a fun book, buy here.

I know people have differant tastes in music, but you idiots insult and denegrate any thing that ISN'T Pantera or Pantera related, just because someone doesn't like Pantera doesn't mean they are a \\"PoSeR\\". You morons need to get a life and stop listening to this garbage, i don't like county music that much either, but it is a respectable form of music and it is about 1,000,000,X's  better then this crap. Dimebag was not a \\"God\\" either, i'v never seen such a hyped up guitar player then this idiot. Now that he is dead, people are gonna proclaim him to be one of the best guitar players and get all of the fame, which is sad because there were deseased metal guitarist with much greater talent and integrity who passed away and got no recognition (i.e. Chriss Oliva, Dennis D'Amour, ect). <br /> <br />Dimebag Darrle was nothing more then an average guitarist, plain and simple. If you dumb enough to belive he was some kind of prodigy, well, i guess then thats why you listen to Pantera.

B0007P3582|1.0|Is there actually many people that like 50 Cent in here? Does anyone care? Is anyone bothered? This truly is a massacre, by one of the worst rappers of all-time. Don't buy this at all. Yeah, one of his song's may be catchy (\\"In Da Club\\" is his only good spark) but after that he went all flip-flop. Seriously, not many people like this album (look at the mass of 1-star reviews!) and his new film (one of the worst of the worst) was a tradgic flop too! Really, you do not want to support this clown. Did anyone see the state of the Window Shopper video? Dissing people just because they aren't rich? Oh, so not only does his music suck, but he's also disrespectful!
B0000A98ZP|3.0|The soundtrack is outstanding, the story is true-to-life: teens spending a day in detention. I did find it somewhat unconvincing since the actors playing teenagers so obviously aren't, and the ending is disappointing. When they return to school on Monday nothing will have changed much. The outcasts will still be outcasts, and they'll all ignore each other despite the one-day of pseudo-bonding. Nice date movie though.
B000ANXLB2|5.0|For many lovers of Beethoven's Symphonies, Karajan's 1962 integrated set of the nine (available as a CD box set from DGG) is the best available. For some (but not me), that collection is definitive: individual symphonies may vary in quality of performance, they say, but in toto, as a unified vision of these orchestral masterpieces, there is no finer set. In his later years, with the dawning of the digital era, Karajan re-recorded the Beethoven Nine. I purchased those autumnal efforts as they were released. I found them to be slow, essentially lackluster performances. They were filmed as well, and when this DVD set was initially offered for sale, I feared it contained films of those later, inferior recordings. Thankfully, it does not.<br /><br />These performances date from the late 1960's - early 1970's. In many ways, they may be the best Beethoven recordings Karajan ever made. Those of you familiar with Carlos Kleiber's recordings of the 5th and 7th Symphonies might be interested to know that Karajan's 5th (lasting 30 minutes) and 7th (34 minutes) have a comparable urgency of expression. They are powerful, fleet explorations of these two ubiquitous works. His 5th is almost as fast as Roger Norrington's speed-freak version. It is as if Karajan sensed the future onslaught of period performances and was determined to pre-empt them.<br /><br /> The 1st (23 minutes) and 2nd (31 minutes) are Haydnesque Symphonies and Karajan conducts them as such. He gives them a Classical grace with a hint of the Beethovenian power to come. I love Beethoven's even-numbered symphonies; beautifully serene and graceful works that are less frequently played. They strike me as more personal expressions of Beethoven's genius, as if he had nothing to prove but his love for Music. The Berlin Philharmonic are like a thoroughbred horse, capable of instantaneously responding to the slightest touch of the reins. Watching Karajan conduct with eyes closed and only the slightest movement of his body is fascinating and the reason why DVD performances will inevitably replace the CD.<br /><br />The \\"Eroica\\" (lasting 48 minutes) is played beautifully; Karajan crafts this structure with intelligence. Though embracing the mystery inherent in this inexplicable masterpiece, his performance flaunts Beethoven's revolutionary clarion call by urgently weaving the strands of fate. This inevitable tension is barely resolved by the repetitive dance-like themes of the final movement. A wonderful performance. The 4th (31 minutes) and 8th (25 minutes) Symphonies are a return to the sound-world of Haydn. Karajan conducts them as if they mean something and not as a mere afterthought; thoroughly enjoyable performances that had me conducting along with him. Thankfully, I was alone and unobserved.<br /><br />The 6th Symphony, the \\"Pastoral\\" (lasting 36 minutes), is lovely, lyrical and serene. It evokes exactly what Beethoven wished to portray, the beauty and majesty of nature. Karajan loses himself in this evergreen score. An exquisite and delicate performance that I immediately replayed. The final work, the 9th Symphony (64 minutes) is sung by a masterful quartet of Gundula Janowitz, Christa Ludwig, Jess Thomas and Walter Berry, all at their peak. All except Thomas are Karajan regulars. Filmed on New Year's, 1968, this is a fleeter, fiercer, more dramatic 9th than Karajan's previously recorded versions. He himself directs the film of this performance, using the camera to emphasize the twists and turns of the work. This is an excellent version of Beethoven's ultimate Symphony.<br /><br />The films of these Symphonies all add to the enjoyment. Artistic self-indulgences are minimized. There are no slap-to-the-forehead, My-God-what-were-they-thinking? moments. The LPCM stereo and DTS 5.1 sound (the best sounding format) are both crystal clear, never betraying the age of these films. The performances are uniformly excellent, making this three DVD set nearly self-recommending. Watching them one can see why Herbert von Karajan and the Berlin Philharmonic were so admired, way back when the world was young.nd the Berlin Philharmonic were so admired, way back when the world was young.

0060537639|1.0|Menzies' \\"history\\" is to real history what alchemy is to science: fiction, but told in a compelling way to make gold from rubbish, and with enough truth at the beginning to lend credence to the rest (there's a good deal of real history at the start, but unreliably told). It's embarassing that so many people have been taken in. And shaming that Menzies - and his publisher - have made vast sums out of the public's gullibility.    Do read Robert Finlay's review, \\"How Not to (Re)Write World History: Gavin Menzies and the Chinese Discovery of America\\", (Journal of World History, June 2004: it's available online) for a long and in-depth evaluation of this book and the author's methodology.

0385495323|4.0|I tried reading this book five years ago when I bought it, giving up within the first 50 pages where the author started explaining how to decrypt a ciphertext. It bored me then. I'm glad I stuck through that minor hump this time around; this is an engrossing, fascinating book about cryptography's role in history. <br /> <br />Singh begins the history with Mary Queen of Scots and how she used a cipher to encrypt letters to her cohorts to plan the assasination of the Queen of England. Besides learning a lot of history, Singh describes the ciphers used in an easy to follow manner, using lots of useful examples. <br /> <br />For those with a computer science background, the book gets really interesting about two-thirds of the way in, when computers come into play for breaking codes developed during World War II. The history of DES, RSA and PGP are compelling, especially when you already know about those standards but didn't know the history of them; and the author describes how all are implemented in layman terms; it is easy to follow if you know little mathematics, although it will make the programmer in you want to start coding the algorithms he describes. <br /> <br />The author has published a less technical version of the book: The Code Book for Young People: How to Make It, Break It, Hack It, Crack It. <br /> <br />I picked up this book because I read the author's previous book, Fermat's Enigma, which is a lot more technical than The Code Book, but it's an interesting tale nevertheless; non-technical readers can skip the meaningless stuff. That book is about how Fermat's Last Theorem was solved after almost 400 years.
0060012358|5.0|This is an awesome story.  Yes, it does have talking animals.  No, that does not make a difference to the quality.  Basically, there is a cat called Maurice who can speak, and he gethers a group of speaking rats, and they get a stupi-looking, pie-playing kid, and go from town to town, conning up money.  See, the rats (there are probably two or three hundred) go in and gnaw and run around and make sure everyone is worked up about the rats, until the mayor sends for a piper.  So the stupi-looking kid comes in and plays them all away.  And they get money.  But Bad Blintz is odd- it has a rat-caused famine, but there are no rats.  The rat catchers bring in hundreds of rat tails, but they aren't real.  And beneath the mystery of the sinister rat catcher lies an unconnected evil far greater than anything any of them have encountered.  Witty, hilarious, and very well-written, this book is awesome.
1577314808|5.0|\\"To regain awareness of Being and to abide in that state of \\"feeling-realization\\" is enlightenment. \\" - E. Tolle <br /> <br />Before I encountered 'The power of now', I was a seeker of enlightenment. I now realize how stupid I was. As Echart Tolle says, Everything that has happened, is happening and will happen , happens in the moment called 'now'. He says \\"The word enlightenment conjures up the idea of some superhuman accomplishment, and the ego likes to keep it that way, but it is simply your natural state of felt oneness with Being.\\" <br /> <br />Through this book Eckhart Tolle demonstrates with practical tips and pointers how exactly this is done i.e. How you can stay in this state of connecteness and experience the joy of being in that state. You need not be a spiritual seeker to read this book. This teaching can be applied in various situations like waiting in a queue, in a traffic jam or even in the midst of a heated arguement. His techique involves staying present as the witnessing conciousness and observing the inner body. <br /> <br />I have observed that sometimes when the emotional charge is very strong, it is sometimes very difficult to stay present as the watcher. At those times I often find a inquiry technique called 'The work' taught by Bryon Katie very useful. She describes this technique in her book \\"Loving what is\\" also free in her website thework.org . Infact Eckhart Tolle himself has endorsed it. I highly recommend that book in addition to the \\"Power of Now\\", however the power of now by itself is sufficient. <br /> <br />If you don't own a copy of 'Power of now', you might consider buying \\"practising the power of now\\" instead. It is a concise version of the power of now with all its essential teachings in 128 pages and is full of excercises and meditations of very high practical value. Also get the Audio CDs as they are narrated by Eckhart tolle himself is good for listening in the car. <br />
0553573403|4.0|A Game of Thrones is George RR Martin's first foray into the world of epic fantasy.  It's a bit of an odd one, since it features very little magic, and no central nemesis.  For that matter, it features no central hero.<br /><br />At first glance, A Game of Thrones looks little like a fantasy novel at all.  Although the opening sequence features some weird supernatural creatures and zombies, none of this appears again until near the end of the book.  The rest is taken up by a stint as the King's Hand by Eddard Stark, and the accompyaning court intrigue.  However, there is also the story of Daenerys Targaryen, the young exiled princess across the ocean, and her adventures with the Dothraki, a group of barbarians patterned after the Mongols.<br /><br />It makes for a satisfying read.  Martin is a good storyteller, and can create some interesting characters.  His weaving of different elements in the court intrigues at King's Landing feels much more genuine than Robert Jordan's contrivances that hinge on nobody telling anyone else anything, even when common sense demands it.  The use of magic as a low-key undercurrent means that it isn't so powerful that Martin has to contrive to make it weaker lest the story suffer.  His characterization sometimes makes people out to be more than they seem (like Sandor Clegane), but sometimes just makes them static villains (like Gregor Clegane).  On top of it all, making the seasons last a long time, and hinting at a coming ten-year winter, provides a delicious piece of ominous malevolence.<br /><br />This is not to say that the book is flawless, of course.  Martin's worldview is excessively cynical, with the guys motivated by honor usually proceeding to do the stupidest things possible and getting themselves killed.  Also, there are too many point-of-view changes, and Martin's insistence that all of them end on a cliffhanger becomes tedious quickly.  Some things in the world just don't seem to make sense, either.  Why is it that Tyrion cares a whit about helping his family?  It's obvious that they could care less about him.  Familial duties could explain it, except that Tyrion seems a little too shrewd and cynical for that to carry much weight.  Also, a crucial element in the story deals with who is the rightful successor to the throne, but once you learn that not two decades earlier the throne was forcibly seized by the current king, rightful successor be damned, you start to wonder why anyone really gives a crap.  And what is with the man's obsession with gratuitous sex?  A scene early in the book is forgivable, as it is important to the storyline, and also believable since a kid unfamiliar with sex would probably see it that way.  However, Daenerys's various sexual adventures are not needed at all, and only jar the flow of the story.  Tyrion's are the same, and I could certainly do without the vivid descriptions of his genitals.  Most of these scenes are indistinguishable from porn, and that's just a waste.  Finally, some of the phrases and slang terms seem rather anachronistic.<br /><br />Overall though, A Game of Thrones is a worthy entry into the fantasy field, and the sheer force of Martin's storytelling supercedes the flaws.  Anyone with an interest in either fantasy or historical fiction would do well to read this one.Tyrion cares a whit about helping his family?  It's obvious that they could care less about him.

B0009NSE1K|3.0|Clutch is a severely underrated band that has endured for much longer than perhaps anyone has a right to in rock music. Most bands  that play this kind of stuff fade after an album or two, but Clutch keeps churning them out and touring non-stop.  For that they deserve respect. <br /> <br />Neil Fallon has never sounded better and is truly at the top of his game, incorporating a lot more melody than he ever has before. His lyrics are as sharp and clever as they always were. <br /> <br />Having said that, the songwriting has gotten weaker with each new album. I remember when Clutch wrote songs that were memorable, with hooks and well written and composed arrangements.  The new material (post-Pure Rock Fury) is a much more jam oriented affair with lots of change ups and generic southern rock riffing.  The effect is that the songs tend to run together and have no personality.  I've listened to this album in its entirety many times and I still cannot tell you what song I'm hearing half the time.  Play the self titled album or even Elephant Riders next to this and you'll see what I'm talking about. <br /> <br />If we could get a Clutch that combines the songwriting of the self titled album with Neil Fallon's constantly improving vocals, we'd have the best band in rock hands down.
B00005JMJ4|3.0|But having lived in Tokyo for 8 years, part of which was at the height of the \\"bubble economy\\", I have a hard time figuring out the mind of the heroine in this plot, namely the girl who becomes enamored with Mr. Murray's character.  <br /> <br />She's in Tokyo, apparently never been there before, has one week to be there before she leaves, and instead of having some curiosity and going out and interacting, she stays around a hotel room all day. She ventures out, a little, mostly to places that seem familiar and urban. I realize Japan has its share of culture shock, but her attitude was a bit over the top.  <br /> <br />What is this? Jet lag? Didn't bring a guidebook? Instant homesickness? Maybe she's just a boring person.  <br /> <br />I think the reason that the Japanese like this movie so much is because it reflects THEIR attitude toward foreigners and foreign travel, e.g. - Don't get too involved and hang around the hotel where the other Japanese are. Also, with \\"Japan as backdrop\\" it's mostly non-judgemental about the country.  <br /> <br />After a couple of YEARS in Japan, (and a few vactions) I started acting a little like that and would retreat to the privacy of my apartment on a regular basis. The only reason I stayed for years was because I lucked out and got a job that had 5 months paid vacation time every year. But I only started turning into a hermit after a LONG TIME had passed, and the place was starting to get old.  <br /> <br />This was also one of the draggiest movies I'd seen for a while. With its Stanley Kubrick style plot timing, (SLOW) I can see why it drove some people nuts to watch it.  <br /> <br />I do realize that the reason for the relationship with Murray is her immature husband's emotional neglect, but the artsy-fartsy emphasis on visuals overwhelms the story line, and I found myself \\"Lost in a Coma\\" a number of times while watching it.  <br /> <br />I did like the way the relationship was handled - with a fair amount of sensitivity andmore realism than a lot of hackneyed relationship flicks. But parts of it were so slow it was like watching paint dry. <br />
0684824906|5.0|Others have captured the essence of the book and the story. <br /> <br />I began by being slightly hesitant to hear Richard Thomas read the story - as I have become accustomed to the deeper, sonorous voices of Peter Graves, James Earl Jones, et al. <br /> <br />However, Thomas' reading is as spell-binding as Ms. Goodwin's writing. His tone sets percisely the right tenor for the subject matter and his warmth in the telling of the story brings images of Lincoln's own grasp upon his audiences. <br /> <br />I was almost sad to realize I had begun listening to the final CD, knowing my journey with this excellent story would come to a close all too soon.
B00004XMV6|1.0|having sex with a serial killer and the guy does everything except kill you. I knew a woman who had by her own admission, been an ex-mental hospital resident with Borderline Personality Disorder, and she was a big fan of this movie. As a woman, I did not feel liberated by anything Rourke did in this film. On the contrary, I felt trashed. Maybe I've got too much self-esteem, but cold, unromantic sex-obsessed men are just not my type. Good film if you're into S and M.
B000022TSV|5.0|opera ever!  It's very raw and authenic interpretation of both Merimee's and Bizet's story.  Filmed in Spain back in 1984, the movie holds a special place in my imagination. Real places such as the cigarette factory, the bullring in Ronda where Escamillo received accolades for his bullfighting prowess.  What I really liked about the movie are the performances by Placido Domingo and Julia Migenes.  They brought Jose and Carmen to life with their dialogue and acting.<br /><br />Please buy this movie.  You're in for a real treat!
B00028HBKM|5.0|A few thoughts:  <br /> <br />1. Not a film for the kiddies.  <br /> <br />2. In the bible, it's no big secret that Jesus (a Jew) was p*****g off the Pharisees (founders of modern day Judaism) by calling them liars and hypocrites, and showing them that their silly laws were leaving them in the dark ages. Fact is, Jesus' teachings were contrary to Judaism's - consequently he was a threat to the status quo. Jews have shown dissent among themselves for years over Judaism - why do you think they have Orthodox, Conservative and Reform sects, some with female(!) Rabbis? A female trying to be a Rabbi back then would have been dragged from the temple and stoned to death.  <br /> <br />3. Too far ahead of his time with his crazy ideas (shown in his actions more than in his words) about womens' rights, the rights of children, and God's law over mans', he was just too much of a threat. Due to the fear of the people in power at that time, they had him snuffed out. No big surprise, all of it is in the bible - why is then a portrayal (an accurate one at that) of Jesus' execution and the events leading up to it considered so controversial? It's been in the bible for centuries.  <br /> <br />4. It's not a feel good film. I felt drained after watching this exceptionally long torture session. I wonder if in fact Jesus went through everything TO THE EXTENT the movie depicts. Most of us would have been dead before the cross was handed to us. However, I have no doubt of the accuracy of the torture and beating scenes. The Jews living on Masada committed suicide rather than be captured by the Romans. This movie might give one an idea why.  <br /> <br />5. I am glad I saw it. Most religious films show an overly sweet Jesus with shlock like glowing robes, which leaves us with the impression that Jesus was somehow other worldly. He was, but he was also human. In most of these movies, we have no idea how brutal an execution like a crucifixion was. Now we know. There are also no glow in the dark eyes, kitschy halos or Romans talking in Shakesperian accents in Passion, thank you Mel.  <br /> <br />6. I felt neither angry nor anti-Semetic (I was raised a Catholic but dropped out at age 9) after watching this. It depicts human folly and the killing of an innocent man during some rather turbulent times. I am also technically (according to Jewish law) Jewish on my mom's side, and I didn't feel at all paranoid. To my Jewish friends who do feel that way, remember, this is not the 1100's or the 1930's. People are brighter than that now, give it a rest, ok?  <br /> <br />7. Main complaints - it dragged, I didn't feel good afterwards - though I wasn't supposed to - higher on brutality than on philosophy. Still, it's a must see.
0440418569|2.0|I'm forced to agree with the last two reviewers. Pullman had me spellbound throughout the first two books and much of the third-I literally couldn't put them down! The books were pure magic! The characters are noble and you truly care about them. Scoresby's death moved me. But the end of \\"The Amber Spyglass\\" was totally disappointing, as Pullman's rather blatant anti-Christian/anti-faith bias comes through most strongly in this book (it crops up in the first two books). Ultimately we find out that everything's a giant cosmic joke. Though how such a sad and pitiful figure as the Authority managed to pull it all off is a mystery! The Authority (God) is portrayed as a decrepit old imbecilic angel, seemingly incapable of such a vast cosmic deception.  <br /> <br />Pullman's disdain for CS Lewis and the Lewis/Tolkein genre of fantasy is well-documented, as Pullman himself has alluded to it more than once. Pullman's disdain for organized Christianity, both Catholic and Protestant (the Catholic Church in Lyra's world has moved its headquarters to Geneva, the birthplace in the real world of John Calvin's Reformed Protestant Christianity) is equally blatant, as the priests of the Church are portrayed as dogmatic, murderous zealots. <br /> <br />The souls in the realm of the dead are released by Lyra into a kind of \\"blessed oblivion\\"-there's no redemption for them, no afterlife of any kind. They simply cease to exist. <br /> <br />I can't tell you how much of a let-down the ending was. Pullman has created this fantastic universe, but ultimately the Authority behind it is a joke. Ultimately there's nothing transcendent about Pullman's universe as there is Tolkein's Middle Earth and Lewis' Narnia. Pullman aparently was writing what he views as a counterbalance to the type of \\"Christian\\" fantasy popularized by Lewis and Tolkein, which, as an atheist he reportedly considers dangerous.  <br /> <br />Maybe Pullman thinks he's knocked Milton off his pedastal but in my opinion Miltonhas little to fear.  <br /> <br />It's sad, really, 'cause this series had so much to offer, but I guess Pullman's atheism wouldn't let him end it any other way.  Had his anti-Christian bias not been as blatant this series might've been much more satisfying. I guess epic fantasy and atheism just don't mix.
B00005JNEI|5.0|Many people view certain elements of their country, such as culture and people, as an entirely separate entity from the government and power structures that rule it (in this context, phrases like \\"love it or leave it\\" have little relevancy). It is this sentiment that led Thomas Paine to say, \\"It is the duty of the patriot to protect his country from its government.\\" Noam Chomsky, a critic of American foreign policy, writes:  <br /> <br />The concept \\"anti-American\\" is an interesting one. The counterpart is used only in totalitarian states or military dictatorships... Thus, in the old Soviet Union, dissidents were condemned as \\"anti-Soviet.\\" That's a natural usage among people with deeply rooted totalitarian instincts, which identify state policy with the society, the people, the culture.  <br /> <br />In contrast, people with even the slightest concept of democracy treat such notions with ridicule and contempt. Suppose someone in Italy who criticizes Italian state policy were condemned as \\"anti-Italian.\\" It would be regarded as too ridiculous even to merit laughter. Maybe under Mussolini, but surely not otherwise.  <br /> <br />It's pretty obvious that the critics of this movie who call Moore Anti-American can't see beyond their Republican noses. Yes, you can be a critic of the American government and a patriot at the same time. Wow! What a concept! If any Repulicans and their chicken hawk friends knew history, they'd know that Jefferson advocated a revolution every 20 years just to keep the government from getting out of control. Moore is a true patriot in the old sense of the word.  <br /> <br />The \\"new\\" patriots like Hannity and Limbaugh are totalitarians wrapped in the stars and stripes, depending on followers too dumb to see what they're really up to. Most Americans can't even recall when we were Saddam's best friends - that's when he was gassing the Kurds. Why didn't we get rid of him then?  <br /> <br />The fact that the US Government encourages trade with China, a Communist country, is and always will be a slap in the face to the veterans of the Vietnam war, who were told they were over there fighting for FREEDOM from Communism. We also do trade with Vietnam, as if they are no longer Communist. Does something stink here? Trouble is, we have had a government that for a long, long time, we can't trust around the corner, and an uneducated citizenry with a very short memory. No wonder the rest of the world thinks we're stupid. I do listen to right wing radio, and never heard anyone knocking trade with China - instead they knock legitimate protests against it, like the WTO protest. Whose side are the chickenhawks on anyway?  <br /> <br />Whenever rich fat-a**ed chicken hawks are telling you to send your poor or working class kid over to fight for oil for Haliburton under some false pretext, it's time for a change.  <br /> <br />I disliked Bowling for Columbine, but I have to hand it to Moore for this one. Good job. <br /> <br />
B000BW7QWW|5.0|I didn't expect to enjoy something that's Western + Asian + Scifi-flavored. I agree with the reviewers out there who say it can still be enjoyable without having seen the TV series, but people who watch that first (on reruns in SciFi or buy/rent, I guess) will definitely get a lot more out of it.    The speech pattern may seem awkward, but it lends to the overall atmosphere. Serenity/Firefly is futuristic, but it's not. It's old-fashioned, but it's not. I wouldn't say there is a huge moralistic or political message in there, though people can always find one they (dis)agree with, and I think the overall message isn't terribly controversial anyway (the road to hell is paved with good intentions?). Some people may hate the Joss witticisms and one-liners, others will love them. It's hard to hit everyone's funny bone at the same time. But for people who don't care for that, the action sequences are good too; there's even some drama. And yes, it does have that feel of the very first Star Wars, though perhaps not as epic.    The only issue I have with Serenity is the lack of a long version of the TV opening song (and generally not memorable soundtrack), and the issue I have with the overall franchise is the lack of Asian-descent people (talk about irony).
0767817478|3.0|it is NOT Godzilla. The old Godzilla relied on strength and its atomic breath to win in battles and/or destroy the city it wanted. This Godzilla has to rely on wits and speed to do...watever its doing. GINO(Godzilla in Name Only) is not very strong. its big and fast, but it cant take a hit to well. (3 missles and it died). but at the end we see one of its eggs has survived..... Does this mean a sequel? If they do make a sequel(and i dont mean that cartoon GINO thing), it had better be better than this movie. Peace
B0006L16N8|1.0|Coldplay is the least rock band of all time, how are they popular? I am a fan of British rock like The Who, Beatles, Floyd, and Zeppelin, but this band just gives British rock a bad name. The lyrics are boring and go nowhere and the music sounds like I'm on an elevator. If you want to listen to some good British rock, go buy Dark Side of the Moon, Abbey Road, Led Zeppelin IV, or Who's Next, but if you need a drug free substitute for Nyquil, then buy X & Y.
B00005JO9J|5.0|I look forward to watching this show every Sunday night, the perfect end to a weekend, light heartedly funny, yet emotionally charged. What makes this show so special? You could say it's the incredibly talented cast, the funny, sometimes out of this world plot lines. Who can ever forget the pregnant man! Perhaps it's how beautifully put together this show is, from the music to the ending monologues that connect these character's stories by glimpsing into their lives when they are most vulnerable, this show finds a way to leave you satisfied after every episode and simultaneously craving the next.   <br /> <br />Dempsey plays the perfect tragic hero, Katherine Heigle is perfect as the conscience of the show, Sandra Oh plays her role of a determined intern lacking complete interpersonal skills, so seamlessly and Pompeo finds a way to play her lonely character in a way where we don't have to feel sorry for her. I can go on and on....but I guess the point is that the cast has a certain chemistry that when all together their acting seems effortless. <br /> <br />With the wave of crime-scene/investigation shows it's nice to have another high quality medical show that I believe can stand right up there with ER. I have to warn you though that this show is not an imitation of ER, it's much more light hearted, yet has these poignant moments of epiphany where you know that the character as grown in some way.  The show is based around five interns making their way through rounds, gaining experience and testing not only their abilities but their will, and confidence to believe in themselves and each other.  <br /> <br />The first season of Grey's Anatomy is a short one as it was a second-half season filler that exceeded all expectations with it's strong ratings, but don't worry I heard that the DVD's are loaded with extras like commentaries, behind the scenes, and unaired scenes.  The second season so far continues to entertain...and I mean this, you will be entertained...you will laugh out loud! <br />

B0000DD7LC|5.0|This is an excellent album - opening with Harlem's Nocturne - showing how arpegios really can flow in classical music - it winds into a complete tornado of music immitating a rain storm in the city streets. <br /> <br />Next we go into Karma which isn't one of my favorites as it lacks her profund talent in her classical music talents dusted with her Neo - Soul style - still she continues to stretch classical music with the violins supporting this song - very nice touch indeed. <br /> <br />Heartburn heavily resembles Hot lunch from the Fame album - listen to the two - their like musical cousins at the same time she shares the same melody of \\"Give it to me\\" the hot papa rap song as performed by Jay Z. <br /> <br />If I was your Woman - is the best remake of Gladys Knights power song - she didn't over make it and respected it for the fine piece that it is. <br /> <br />You Don't know my name - again is not one of my favorites but it works here - again Alicia shows her true talent in ballad type songs lightly dusted by her piano no how and powerful lungs. <br /> <br />If I Aint' Got you - is one of the most powerful songs I've heard - she really proved her maturity level here in age and in her piano playing skills - if you listen to the live or unplugged version - you see how she improvised a lot of the keystrokes in key changing - the song unfolds to the very end - thank you for giving it a solid ending instead of fading out like Most Artist may do (urrrrrrrghhhhh) <br /> <br />Diary is a beautiful song and like a Diary is well kept secret musically speaking - if you are a musician - get the sheet music and you'll know exactly what I'm talking about. <br /> <br />I'll skip down to Feeling you - Feeling me - this song really images Remy Shands work - see B.  Another Neo - Soul artist that know his stuff - Listen to \\"The Mind's Eye\\" (album Title: The Way I Feel) towards the end and you'll understnad what I mean - Feeling you Feeling me should have been at least a full range song and not to tease us as an Interlude - still the same that's what makes us coming back for more.  Added comment is Remy Shand and Alicia should really team up on an album - at least one hit.......can I get an 'Amen' if you agree with me. <br /> <br />Nobody Not Really - perfect way to end the Album BUT GUESS WHAT - IT'S NOT THE END OF THE ALBUM THERE IS A BONUS TRACK CALLED: LOVING U - yes, a bonus track - a great modificaion of Natural Woman - she jack slaps this song and brings great tribute to Neo-Soul - and invests real music - real talent - real musicians back into the music industry - no manufactured music through out this entire album - if you're sick of Rap like me - support Alicia and her workings......

B0002F6BRE|4.0|<br />For a lot of moviegoers, Bob Clark's delightful A CHRISTMAS STORY (1983) is their sleeper favorite Christmas movie each year.  Mine, after believing in Santa again after two superb versions of MIRACLE ON 34TH STREET (George Seaton and John Hughes), is bound to become director Jon Favreau's hilarious and inspired ELF (2003).  Here is the premise in David Berenbaum's very original screenplay:  a baby who crawls into Santa's toy bag ends up being raised at the North Pole by Papa Elf (a wonderful Bob Newhart).  At age 30, elf Buddy (a wonderful Will Farrell) is a real elf sent to find his human father (James Caan) in a Christmas New York City filled with fake elves and phony Santas in myriad toy departments.  Caan is much too busy with ad accounts in his Empire State Building office, so Buddy finds himself in the Toy Department at Gimbels.  There is a very funny scene where a huge boss of the department tells him to get back to work and stop saying \\"This is not the North Pole-where's the snow?\\"  Watch Buddy jump for joy when told by the boss that Santa is coming at 10:00 a.m. the next morning. <br /> <br />Buddy falls in love with an incandescently delightful Zooey Deschanel, as a hardworking Gimbels elf.  Working all night to make the Toy Department look like the real North Pole, Buddy wanders into the empty women's locker room at dawn when he hears Zooey taking a shower and sweetly singing \\"Baby, It's Cold Outside.\\"  Deschanel has a lovely singing voice and, like Farrell, should have gotten an Oscar nomination.  In another movie era, ELF would make her a star.  She slowly realizes that Buddy is the real thing; so do Caan's wife, Mary Steenburgen, and whoever plays his young son.  Buddy does outlandish things, like eating spaghetti with maple syrup and drinking a whole two liter bottle of Pepsi in one gulp, then letting loose with a 20 second belch that had me on the floor laughing, despite my better judgment.  It is FUNNY. <br /> <br />ELF is sublime whenever Zooey is on screen with Buddy.  With Sinatra's \\"You Make Me Feel So Young\\" on the soundtrack, the two discover the Christmas wonders of Manhattan, including Rockefeller Center and the largest tree Buddy has ever seen.  And they share a lovely first kiss while ice skating.  Poor Caan keeps losing ad accounts with unbelievers, but slowly warms to his elf son because everything Buddy does has good intentions, like cutting down a gigantic Christmas tree in Central Park to have a tree at home. <br /> <br />On Christmas Eve, Santa (a well-cast Ed Asner) brings his presents and sleigh to Central Park, but finds himself grounded there because his sleigh is powered by believers, who are in short supply!  But eventually even Caan becomes a believer when he passes up a huge ad account to be with his neglected real young son, Buddy's brother.  Zooey shows up to do a heartfelt rendition of \\"Santa Claus Is Coming to Town\\", eventually joined in by a huge gathering of believers.  Obviously, the movie has a happy ending.  I won't tell you what it is.  I have already given away  of the plot. <br /> <br />ELF reminded me a bit of John Hughes' expert remake of MIRACLE ON 34TH STREET (1994), where Richard Attenborough is so convincing as Santa and enchanting young Mara Wilson is such a true believer that the whole movie works beautifully to make even jaded adults rethink their previous training about Santa really being your parents.  When Buddy hears this story from Papa Elf at the North Pole, he scoffs hilariously, \\"Oh yeah, right.  I'm sure the parents have time to work and still get all the presents and make the cookies for Santa's visit!\\"  If you can find enough magic in your heart to try and believe in a real Santa Claus and genuine North Pole Elves, the wonderful duo of Will Farrell and Zooey Deschanel in ELF will sure go a long way toward making a believer out of you.   Even if you don't believe, you should still laugh a lot and have a good time. <br /> <br />ELF is a movie thatseems destined to be a Christmas season movie perennial.  John Debney did the lovely ethereal music score, which is interspersed with traditional carols, and Rusty Smith is credited production designer for the fun job of transforming Gimbels Toy Department into the North Pole.  Now who are director Jon Favreau and writer David Berenbaum?  I look forward to what they both do next.  The movie is both Full Screen and 1.85 Wide Screen on DVD.  It is also an Infini Film that you can play with a trivia footnotes commentary over the movie, if you like.  There is also a traditional commentary with Favreau and Farrell, but I opted for the straight movie to hear all of the dialogue.  Have fun with ELF. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
B000BGH22W|3.0|Rabid fans of Pulp and Radiohead may lament the fact that the Britrock kings Jarvis Cocker, Steve Mackey, Phil Selway and Jonny Greenwood have followed in Ian Brown's footsteps thanks to their fleeting appearance in the latest Potter film as rock band The Wyrd Sisters, but the saving grace is their music contributions.  <br />Patrick Doyle's tense score of strings and ominous symphonies are all well and good if you like that sort of thing, but it's the three Wyrd Sisters tracks attached to the end of this soundtrack which save the day.  <br />\\"Thankyou very much!\\" the charismatic Cocker announces at the beginning of Do The Hippogriff. \\"Are you ready for some real music?\\" I can't hear you!\\"  <br />It's a little hard to match His N Hers and Hail To The Thief glories when you're singing about spells, griffins and sorcery, but this supergroup (also featuring producer Jason Buckle of Fat Truckers and Add N To (X)'s Steve Claydon) does a bang-up job of making Potter rock. A must for completists who wish to hear Jonny Greenwood's trademark guitar squalls on This Is The Night or a Glory Days-ish Jarvis Cocker croon on Magic Works, this is indeed briefly spellbinding.
B000BOH8XW|5.0|I really love most of the songs in this album. It's different, love the songs..it's great overall. The lyrics are awesome for an artist whose native language is not English. You can realize that this artist really has the talent to not only sing, dance, but also write, and you don't get that a lot nowadays with most artists.
B000001A3H|5.0|Kyuss developed a unique style of their own, they took the low sabbath riffs to a dense loudly distortion, bass guitar did its part too, actually Nick Olivieri may well be responsible of the sound of stoner rock and the unique style of kyuss, Josh Homme guitar sounds have a lot of misthycal and environmental, some sort of warm air such as in a desert you can feel and this music takes you to a beautifull and captivating place, the heat cuts the fresh air and wind coaugulates from the ground, the whole album is a trip, a mental trip to several intriguing places, once you get out of the atmosphere you want to return to it , over and over again <br />HM
0800141806|5.0|I stubbornly resisted this movie because its topic about homosexuality, and will admit I was baiased against it for only that reason.  When I finally watched it (from a purely paralegal point of view) I was amazed at the sensitivity given the issue at hand: not necessarily homosexuality, but having AIDS, and the bias our society still has for such issues, even in 2005. (And sorry that I allowed my predujiced feelings to get in the way.)  It is a case like this - real or imagined - that validates the legal system.  A great wrong was comitted against Mr. Beckett, and he fought back, and WON.  The relationship between Andy & Miguel was handled tastefully and tactfully, and wasn't offensive to me at all.  I was especially grateful to see how supportive Andy's family was for him during this horrible time in his life.  I very highly recommend this movie for the \\"historical\\" value that is has: not only putting a \\"face\\" to AIDS and homosexuality, but for bringing awareness to the subject.
B000005Z0E|5.0|The theme for 2Pacalypse now is obvious: the Black community. This album definetly should have been given 5 mics on the strength of Pac's subject matter, and his rhymes and flow are also on point, altough sometimes old school. Although NWA gets much praise for Straight Outta Compton, 2pacalypse Now discusses more issues relevant to the Black community.  Songs like \\"Trapped\\", \\"Words of Wisdom\\", and \\"Violent\\" describe police brutality, unity, and 2Pac's frustration with the decaying conditions in the Black ghettos.  Songs like \\"Brenda's Got A Baby\\", and \\"Part Time Mutha\\" depict situations pertinent to young Black women in the ghetto and some problems they face such as pre teen pregnancy, and irresponsible young mothers.  Pac does a great job of exhibiting his anger with the ever growing problems in the ghettos across America. Great album!!
B00009V8Z9|5.0|Gavin DeGraw has the kind of talent that is timeless. His voice is not technically one of the best I've ever heard. But he sings with such passion and raw grit that I consider him one of the greatest singers I've ever heard. I've had this CD well over a year, but I am just getting around to writing this review. If you don't have this CD, you are missing out on one of the all-around best albums out there. Starting out with \\"Follow Through\\", Gavin's unique vocals and catchy hooks pull you right in. The song is the perfect lead off for an amazing album. The title track \\"Chariot\\" kicks in with a blend of piano and an eclectic mix of instruments. It sounds awesome. Gavin sounds soulful and convincingly sad and scorned on \\"Just Friends\\" which I love because he slows it down a bit and plays his heart out on the piano. \\"Nice to Meet YOu (Anyway) is very catchy. The real gem on this CD however, is \\"More Than Anyone.\\" This is just narrowly my favorite on the CD (tough decision) It is one of the most beautiful love songs you will ever hear. This album is a must have. <br /> <br />Gavin DeGraw makes me happy. With so much overproduced meaningless pop music out there today, he is a breath of fresh air. He's marketable (and gorgeous) but he doesn't change who he is. You can tell all the lyrics on his debut meant something to him. He is a true talent, one who will be around for years to come.
B000C1ZXEU|5.0|I only just finished reading the book at 2 a.m this morning and the first description that came to mind as I turned the final page was that it was written extremely gracefully. <br /> <br />Some reviewers have decribed it as a coming of age story. Yes, it is that and more...so much more. There are several themes running through it and in the hands of another writer it might have seemed contrived but in the hands of this writer, not one word or situation rings false. She deftly weaves together all these varied themes to create her story. All of her characters have great depth and we come away feeling like we know them personally. Something else I liked was the fact that her charcters weren't one dimensional, neither good nor bad. They were just people struggling with their own personal demons and everyday life, people like you and me. <br /> <br />I'm Nigerian and did live a great part of my life there and some of the characters, places and situation did bring back strong, vivid memories. I did visit with my aunt in Enugu and the conditions of living with her and her family were somewhat reminiscent of the same conditions of living with Kambili's Aunty Ifeoma. And that's asides from the other characters in the book. I know some of them or more specifically I recognize bits of some of the people I know in some of them. I know some of those situations. I know Mama Joe, I knew several Sisis, I see a bit of my grandfather with his rigid Catholiscism in Eugene but there the similarity stops. <br /> <br />Our teenage protagonist is one that stays with you for a long time. She will haunt you long after you've put the book down. Her perceptiveness is uncanny and her ability to absorb and interprete life and events sends tingles down your spine. what touches me most is all the things she wishes she could have said and didnt or couldnt. <br /> <br />The book has its flaws but there are too many high points to notice them. I have read some of Ms. Adichie's essays and I do believe she is one to watch. No, let me rephrase that she is here to stay and I'm very proud of her.
B0006399FS|1.0|This is easily the worst U2 record in existence - everything they do on it sounds contrived and manipulated to press those nostalgic buttons for old fans (like myself). The problem is they have become nothing but a marketed brand thanks to Bono's political escapades and attempts to save the world. The band, and the music suffers from simply having no interesting music on it. <br /> <br />Avoid this like the plague it is. This is even more forced and bland than All That You Can't Leave Behind.
B00005JO04|5.0|\\"Syriana\\" is a complex film about oil, terrorism, the government, and other related issues.  It is so intricate, that it really cannot be described in a way to make it clear.  There are, however, three main story lines. First, Bob Barnes (Clooney) is a Middle East CIA operative that is let go after he ceases to be helpful.  Second, Connex and Killen are two oil companies that are merging.  Third, Prince Nasir Al-Subaai (Siddig) is next in line to become Emir of his unnamed country, and believes that his country should not give in to the United States.  These story lines, as well as the others, all come together in the end in a satisfying conclusion.<br /><br />\\"Syriana\\" is a thinking person's movie.  If you do not pay attention, you will get lost very quickly.  But, if you pay attention, \\"Syriana\\" is highly satisfying.  Structured like \\"Traffic\\" and \\"Crash\\", \\"Syriana\\" is a movie that makes you think.  The cast is excellent all around, all providing their piece of the puzzle.  Director Stephen Gaghan weaves the tale skillfully, bringing seemingly unrelated stories together for a fantastic finish.  \\"Syriana\\" is definately not a movie for everyone, but I highly recommend this film.
B00005JO1Y|5.0|This was the best film ever! Only if it has an Intermission-So that we can go the bathroom, Get Popcorn, Drinks and Some Candy, and then come on back for the rest of the show. Peter Jackson (The LOTR Trilogy) wants this film to stay true to the 1933 version, instead of the 1976 Re-Make. While in New York, Kong had to defend those red baron planes while staying on top of The Empire State Building. In 1933, Kong stayed on top of  The Chrysler Building, and in 1976, It was the towers of The World Trade Center, where Kong was perched. I think Jack Black has done a wonderful job playing seriously-minded film director Carl Denham. Black, is beter known as a comedic actor, Known for playing Goofballs, Slackers, Moochers, and Jerks might have some characteristics of Late SNLers Chris Farley & John Belushi, as well as John's Brother, Jim.I think The movie-goers has finally spoken! THIS is a good movie. Be prepared to sit for 3 Big Hours. It's worth it!
0385507755|1.0|When I read this book I was all of the things the author intended, stunned, horrified, moved and inspired.  I have been fortunate to have had no experience with recovery, either for myself or any loved ones, which could explain how I was so easily misled.  I only realized exactly how gullible I was upon reading other readers' reviews. DUH! Of COURSE a dentist can use a local anesthetic for someone in recovery, an airline won't let a blood/urine/vomit/spit/snot-soaked unconscious passenger on a plane, a world-class treatment center would require hospitalization for the types of wounds Frey describes before admittance and certainly would not allow a counselor to drive a patient to a crackhouse.   That Frey's companions and experiences in treatment all served to affirm his manhood should have set off alarm bells. Pretty much every \\"fact\\" in the book is suspect for me now.   <br /> <br />In one scene, Frey describes a visit from a rock star (who I think was supposed to be Steven Tyler).  He wrote about his and his fellow patients' rage because the rock star stood before the room and misrepresented his disease and his treatment.  Frey, apparently, has done the same thing on a much larger scale. I feel like a class-A jerk for ever buying into it.
B000BTJDGC|3.0|So we bought the movie the night it was released, got half way through it, and the strangest thing ever happened.  A friend was over and she brought her healthy 10 month old cat.  The cat had all shots, and was completly healthy in all ways.  Next thing that happened, the cat took off running to one side of the room, let out a long blood curdleing scream, and seemed to have what appeared to be either a seizure or a heart attack and within about 15 seconds was dead.  I don't really think that the two are related, but there was no cause for the cats death and to be so sudden like that, it makes you wonder.  So, the movie is not bad and is reminiscent of the original Exorcist but I am leary about watching it again.  You never know!
B000B8QEZG|5.0|Another awesome album from Madonna, I could hardly wait to get home and listen to this. <br /> <br />I put it on and boogied with my kids (I know, not very glamorous but lots of fun!) around the lounge for the next hour or more.  I have been a fan of Madonna ever since I saw \\"Desperately Seeking Susan\\" as an impressionable 12 year old (I had my first cigarette outside the movie theatre that day). <br /> <br />Since then I have liked most of Madonna's stuff, it's always different.  This album has high energy, good dancing music which is great for parties, and great for dancing to. <br /> <br />Highly recommended!
B00000I2PG|5.0|... but who am Ikidding, this album is simply prefection, and in future years will be looked on as a Beethovens 5th or Handels Messiah. Its a \\"Woodface\\", a \\"Nevermind\\" , one of those albums that is note perfect from start to finish.. that has you standing on top of your car singing, if James Bond was an album, he would be this one. I listended to it for the first time in years last week driving across Ireland and it was just as wonderful as when I bought it in 1982... if you have been in love, are in love, want to be in love, want to be a pop star, want to be a movie star.. buy this album.
0312323859|5.0|I hope there's a _Something Old_ and _Something New_ to follow Emily Giffin's first two novels-- it was too hard to say goodbye to these now familiar and very likeable characters by the end of _Something Blue_!  <br /> <br />It takes a while to warm up to Darcy, this novel's protagonist, but it's well worth the effort. Giffin delineates Darcy's emotional growth believably and compellingly. Along the way, a slow but deeply felt romance develops between Darcy and the last person she expected to love (and what's doubly nice is that the man she falls in love with never expected to fall for her, either). Darcy also comes to terms with her feelings for her former best friend, Rachel. The only loose end for me involved what might have happened to Marcus, the father of Darcy's twins. <br /> <br />Others have done a great job summarizing this book so I won't bother doing that. But I wanted to join in with the praise for this very engaging, elegantly written, and satisfying novel. It's absolutely worth reading.
B0007KTAU4|3.0|I have always been a fan of the \\"French Chanteuse\\" tradition, and it is nice to see some new women singers evolve in the style of such women as Barbara--whom I unconditionally adore! Consequently, Bruni's c.d. is a new essential in my collection.    However, I am inclined to agree with some of the less than glowing reviews concerning Bruni as an \\"artist.\\" The music on the c.d. can be monotonous, and her singing style is wearing after 12 tracks. To hear Bruni whisper through a song, and then to hear a singer such as Keren Ann...let's just say, in my humble opinion, that they are not in the same league. Keren Ann is an \\"artist.\\" Barbara is an \\"artist.\\" Bruni is trying really hard. Not that that's a bad thing....    For the most part, the songs I most prefer are the ones that Bruni did not entirely write herself. \\"Quelqu'un m'a dit,\\" \\"La Noyee\\" et \\"Le Ciel Dans Une Chambre\\" are wonderful! I listen to them constantly, and they alone make this album worth the purchase. As to the others...well, how many of us really love every song on every c.d. we buy?
B00000JPYQ|5.0|Without a question, the best live cd I have ever heard, no faults at all.  If you like hard rock this is a must own cd.
B00007LVBN|5.0|This disc is made in Austria but comes in a fabulous digipak packaging that opens up into 3 squares with liner notes written by no other than the great James Taylor himself.  The remastering job done here is also very good as the sound quality overall is excellent too.  After listening to music coming on close to 4 decades already, I'll have to say that there are very few albums that come under the \\"great\\" category and guys, this is definitely one of them.  The heartfelt emotion that's delivered here can only be done by the great songwriter herself who clearly feels and identifies with what she has written.  Every single track here is a masterpiece of composition and performance which makes me wonder why Carole King didn't just start out singing her own material.  I guess the answer is that it's much easier to get passive income getting royalties while somebody else does all the hard work of practicing and touring but boy does Carole have a great voice though.  Tracks that are so hearfelt that it's as if Carole is singing directly to your soul when you listen to this disc.  Why this album is not regularly listed as among the top-5 albums of all-time truly escapes me.  This is a definite must-have in any music hobbyist's library.  Extremely highly recommended.
B00004SAJK|4.0|Except for \\"Something Else\\" which is a rather odd song,  this album still sounds great over 20 years later.
B000003S09|4.0|This 30th Anniversary edition of Court is a real treat for Crimson fans.  Not only has the sound been remastered to near perfection but the liner notes are also very well designed with lyrics and paper clippings harking to the old days included to boot.  For want of a better definition and to satisfy those that absolutely have to categorise everything that they hear, this would be the godfather of the progressive rock genre.  To call it the progenitor of progressive rock would be misleading and incorrect as depending upon how you think about it, even Sgt Pepper's, Velvet Underground's first album and Pink Floyd's Sid Barrett days could all be called progressive rock but still this album is a work of art on it's own and is deserving of all the accolades that it has received to date and continues to receive today.  Great opening powerhouse track followed by more mellow Moody Blues-like stuff and ending on a powerful note.  Essential listening for music hobbyists and a recording that is seminal and really grows on you.  Recommended.
B0007Y08PQ|3.0|Is it time for me to restate the oft-repeated explanation about odd vs even Star Trek films? Long story short: even good, odd bad. While I did like Generations(#7) and Search for Spock(#3), Insurrection(#9) does have some quite big concerns and plot holes and even a bit bad attempted humor but after being very dark with First Contact, it's nice to see them lighten up for once. <br /> <br />On a planet, there's a secret investigation that's sanctioned by Starfleet: the spying on and eventual removal of a race called the Bak'u or is it B'aku? Anyways, there's something special about the planet: some kind of radiation in the planet regenerates celluar structure continously. In layman's terms, fountain of youth. So of course it's no surprise Starfleet wants in which goes against the Prime Directive, meaning they can't interfere in the development of societies. <br /> <br />The race that's bringing out this is the Son'a, a race who try to extend life by going stretchy faced. With help from a rogue Starfleet Admiral, they try to keep the Enterprise off the planet and gone but wants our favorite crew realizes it, they go against orders and try to save the B'aku. <br /> <br />The film in a way has a tone that resembles The Voyage Home(#4, another fan favorite althought not saying 9 is). Voyage Home was largely character and humor based so it was very atypical but that's what made it special. To watch your favorite characters have fun was what made it appealing. Sort of the same with Insurrection although some of the humor is flat. The HMS Pinafore use, a \\"firmer boobs\\" joke and Worf's bit of puberty just comes across as lowbrow humor rather than just being very funny. <br /> <br />It is however a Star Trek movie so we can expect some cool action scenes and cool set pieces. To me, one of which stands out which is why the Enterprise takes on a Son'a ship in the middle of a nebula(Wrath of Khan anyone?) One thing that did strike me though was the set design. Meant to be shownas a kind of idyllic vacation-like village, it surely looks like somewhere you'd love to spend your summer. Very nicely done and beautifully photographed. <br /> <br />Performances are typical across the board, each character plays just like their character would so don't expect Oscar caliber(really, Star Trek for acting awards? That'll be the day.) Although disappointingly is F. Murray Abraham as main village Ru'afo. Villains like Khan stood out cause although they essentially badmouthed our heroes, you felt something when they were disposed of(namely \\"take that punk!\\"). Here when our villain gets his comeuppance it's just simply \\"well there he goes.\\" <br /> <br />It's not as bad a Star Trek as one would claim(that honor is fought between Nemesis and Final Frontier) but it is an entertaining B-movie with A level cast and production.
B00006LI4S|5.0|I thought this entire DVD was wonderful, and all that appeared on it.  Especially touching were the renditions of Bizet's \\"Je Crois Entendre Encore\\"  and Shakespeare's Sonnet 18,(which I am embarrassed to say I've never heard before) arranged so perfectly by Michael Kamen. After listening to/watching this DVD for the 1000th time, I still find them heart-breakingly beautiful, and cannot get them out of my head.  After the Bizet piece, I love the little smile that he gives to his ensemble. If you've watched the practice session in \\"Home Movies\\", it makes so much sense.  He has a beautiful voice and plays his guitar like he was born with it in his hands. Caroline Dale is such a talent, and lends it so exquisitely to every piece she performs in.    I would highly recommend this purchase. If you're a David Gilmour fan, it's a great choice. Yeah, he's getting older, but so is everybody.     Hey, Nolan, who's an enduring musician, and who's a big-mouth-got-nothing-good-to-say-hey-where's-your-concert-DVD- moron?    I was fortunate enough to get a 12th row center orchestra seat for his April 16th show at the Paramount in Oakland, and I CANNOT wait to see him.  If it's any indication (this DVD)of what the show will be like, I'll be in 7th heaven!!!! yippeeee!
B000BW7QWW|5.0|There are essentially 3 people that will watch this film: 1) the so-called \\"Browncoats\\", huge fans of the show Firefly and who probably campaigned to save the show after it was cancelled after 11 of the 14 episodes air. 2)People like me that saw a couple of Firefly episodes but either didn't watch enough to be a fan or are a fan but haven't watched the entire thing and became group number 1. 3) non-fans of anything Firefly related and merely saw it out of trailer interest or store browsing. Well as part of group #2, I can say that it's quite the film although you might be lost on certain things. <br /> <br />In the future, Earth became too populated so we branched out. America and China formed to become one big superpower(Amerina? Chirica?) and formed the Alliance featuring other central planets. They also are hunting the Tams, brother/sister duo Simon and River although more specifically River who was engineered to be quite efficient at killing. They both ends up on the ship Serenity. <br /> <br />On this ship are quite a crew of characters: captain Mal, husband and wife Wash and Zoe, engineer Kaylee, main muscle Jayne and also returning are preacher Shepherd Book and \\"companion\\" Inara(she's similar to a geisha I believe, an artisan entertainer rather than a whore). So the entire team is trying to solve the mystery of why the Alliance are after River and also avoiding them and Reavers, primitive people who love to eat/rape people. <br /> <br />The first Star Wars trilogy left such a mark on cinema because it had funny moments as well as drama and action. Lately though the recent trilogy has a feeling of \\"talk talk talk, action, talk talk talk and by the way look at our awesome effects\\". Well Serenity is well-done as it contains many funny dialogue, moments of character and even some well-designed action sequences including an early chase scene in the valley. <br /> <br />What might be disorienting to people is the fact that the film assumes people watching Serenityhave watched Firefly so they continue on characters where you're like \\"whoa, who's he?\\" such as when Book shows up. But since the movie was written(and demanded I might add) by the fans, the \\"Browncoats\\", it's obvious they're didn't need to be any episode recap such as the X-Files film. <br /> <br />Compared to special features, this release is a little bare. While I am recommend a purchase, I am most likely thinking there will be a 2 disc edition with a whole bunch of goodies. What we do have though are outtakes, deleted scenes, couple of featurettes and 2 great pieces: a 3 1/2 minute intro with writer/director Joss Whedon who at one point made me laugh \\"the film was made for you because you wanted it so if it sucks it's your fault\\". Then we have the commentary with him alone who manages to be witty and funny and quite informative at the same time. <br /> <br />If you're into Firefly, you'll love it. And like me into general sci-fi you''ll probably love it too.
0790733226|5.0|This is more of a personal response to this movie, since many other reviewers have detailed the plot, the actors, the strengths and (though few, in my opinion) the weakenesses. <br /> <br />To the dismay of my family, especially of my 14-year-old daughter, this is still one of my favorite movies, if not my most favorite.  (To be fair to said daughter, a few weeks ago she picked this one from a list of three, sat through the entire movie, and then wanted to discuss it afterward.  Yessss!) <br /> <br />I have dealt through my entire adult life with the issues of \\"science vs. religion.\\"  No other Hollywood movie I'm familiar with addresses this nexus so well.  I grew up in a conservative religious environment, in which the short chronology of Earth was a given.  And by short I mean about 6,000 years, per the genealogical chronologies of the Hebrew Old Testament. (As you may know, the Greek Septuagint OT chronologies run a tad longer, say about 7,000.) <br /> <br />Graduate study in ancient Near Eastern history/achaeology and excursions into geology (including a three-week stint in the fossil forests of the Yellowstone) forced me to reconsider the \\"given-ness\\" of the short age of Earth, and to look more objectively at the nature of \\"truth,\\" of perception and epistmelogy, of \\"myth\\" (as an organizing stucture).  Without saying more, let me just say that this personal journey has left me closer to Ellie Arroway than to Joss Palmer. <br /> <br />I used to say that religion and science were two valid ways of looking at the universe.  Now I'm not even sure what such an assertion means.  I no longer think of myself as a two-part witness to reality (whatever that is).  Split epistemology like this no longer works for me. <br /> <br />Ellie and Joss wrestle with \\"Ocham's Razor.\\"  In terms that would be entirely at home in the Evolution vs. Intelligent Design \\"debate,\\" this movie asks the hard question that few on the religious Right today seen to care for:  \\"What is the evidence.\\" <br /> <br />Other reviewers have made the point, correctly, that this movie is appropriately ambiguous on the answers to the largest questions.  That said, good science still has the best approach to deriving trustworthy answers about the universe.  I will leave for others the question of the place of religion in this mix.
B000BKVQTS|2.0|Now some movies don't have the \\"empty pocket\\" syndrome of other films where if you need money the studio just gives you some more to help, provided the film makes its money and then some. But there are some films that come out with a limited budget and it keeps. Such was the case with the Brothers Grimm which was made for around 80 million. Now to Joe Normal, 80 million is a lot but on a major picture, it wouldn't even cover the salaries for Mel Gibson, Will Smith, Julia Roberts and Govenah Ahnuld. Well unfortunately Brothers Grimm suffers not only from laughably bad CG but an even stupid story. <br /> <br />The world is basically all fairy tales in one world. So when Little Red Riding Hood and Greta(from Hansel and Gretel) are kidnapped, townspeople look to the French to help. So they send Will and Jacob, noted for being demon vanquishers. Only problem is they're con men, using trickery to make people believe they're being attacked, exorcise the demon, take the money and take off. So when they're brought in to investigate, they find themselves in the middle of something that could be the real thing. <br /> <br />The movie sucks and I can't figure it out. The talent: Terry Gillam, noted surreal director known for 12 Monkeys, Fear and Loathing... and Brazil. Good cast with Matt Damon, Heath Ledger and easy on the eyes Monica Bellucci. Maybe it's not even scary? The \\"scares\\" are meant to freak us out and uncalm us yet we're watching with mainly apathy. Is it dramatic? Not really. The stakes never seem to be high and there's no rejoice when our villain is taken care of. <br /> <br />Since the film has the look of Sleepy Hollow's distant cousin, it certainly looks the part until the CGI steps in. This is laughably bad and you can obviously tell where the CG steps in. The CG works best when it's not noticeable, where it's in the scene but it's actually hidden, almost like you couldn't tell it was. Here it's painfully obvious with a bad Gingerbread Man effect and one effect where 2 people fly just looks like bad compositing. Serenity had a small budget(even smaller I believe) yet the CG looks better there then here. Late in the film there's an abundance of red and it just looks very ugly. <br /> <br />Is there any redeeming value? Maybe. Monica Bellucci and Lena Headley are a nice sight and Heath Ledger is quite believable as very fidgety Jacob. Peter Stormare, known for Lost World and Armageddon knows how to play the comic relief, often playing foreign characters and here maybe it's overwriting but he seems a bit TOO much in the movie. <br /> <br />I knew that people found it stupid before I rent it but I thought people would say that about any film yet you watch and it's pretty good. Well, sorry guys, should've listened to you.
B000274THQ|5.0|Upon my initial viewing of this charming little film, another foreign film came to mind; Almodovar's \\"All About My Mother\\", which most of you should check out, if you haven't already.  Mostly \\"Good Bye, Lenin\\" works due to it's casting, dry and visual humour, and original ideas.<br /><br />The visual of Lenin flying away via helicopter is absolute brilliance, but then none of it would work without a decent cast.  The actress who plays Daniel Bruhl's mother is not only superlative, but very attractive.  A film like this could have easily gone the route of melodrama, but it stays firmly on the line between humour and drama, and thankfully works as both.<br /><br />Highly recommended.
B000002RXS|5.0|Even though Callas did not play \\"Carmen\\" on stage, she really saw through Carmen. AMAZING.
B0002KVUKM|5.0|I really had my doubts about this film and by the end I couldn't believe how much fun I had. I, for one, liked all of the monsters on this film. The acting was fantastic; Richard made a great Dracula, Frankenstein's monster was sympathetic and Jackman made a great Van Helsing.<br /><br />I'm one who is confused by all of the negativity of this film. It's a great thrill ride that is just fun to watch. I wouldn't mind it if they made Van Helsing II. It was great.
B0000AMRJC|5.0|\\"Scarface is the story of Tony Montana, a Cuban immigrant who manages to make his way into the highly lucractive cocaine business in 1980's Miami. Tony, and his more laid back friend Manny Ray (Steven Bauer), start out doing pick up jobs for local drug boss Frank Lopez (Robert Loggia). But Tony's ruthless ambition and \\"balls\\" allow him to rise up through the ranks. He eventually breaks off from Lopez and establishes a much more profitable business contact with a Colombian drug lord (Paul Shear). <br /> <br />Along the way, Tony gets together with Elvira (Michele Pheiffer), former girlfriend of Lopez. But their relationship is based only on money and status, lacking the love and personal connection to make it anything but shallow and empty. Tony's sister Gina (Mary Elizabeth Mastrantiono) also becomes involved in the criminal lifestyle, as the girlfriend of Manny. But Tony is unable to accept his sister as anything but a vessel of purity, a symbol of the \\"good world\\" of family and morality that he long ago left behind. He ends up killing Manny for \\"corrupting\\" his sister.  <br /> <br />The movie concludes with Tony, through his greed and macho bravado, having managed to alienate his Colombian business partner. A drug turf war then ensues, with the more powerful Colombian kingpin finally sending an army of his mercenaries to Tony's Miami mansion. Thus Tony's life ends in the expected outcome for a man of his lifestyle and character - lying down to die in a pool of blood.  <br /> <br />What makes \\"Scarface\\" a classic is that it manages to rise far above the typical action film, into a tale about the excesses of American materialism and the morally and spiritually backrupt extremes some people are willing to go to achieve their desires for wealth and power. Tony is an empty man who longs for fulfillment through money, women, status, etc. But he ends up finding nothing but misery, as illustrated by his dining room complaint that there is nothing to his life but \\"eating,drinking, f**king, sucking\\". Ultimately, Tony is able to care about no one but himself and ends up loveless, friendless, strung out on coke and, finally, murdered. In Tony's version of the \\"American Dream\\" - \\"The World Is Yours\\". But at what price?
B00005Y1MT|5.0|I've been a longtime Marillion fan, since the days of Fugazi, my first Marillion album (on vynil). I even bought Anoraknophobia before it existed...<br /><br />Marillion has made, in my humble opinion, FOUR masterpieces: the very well-known Misplaced Childhood (their most successful release yet), immediately following: Clutching at Straws, an insightful view at the addiction world (too Fish-y probably: excellent!), then some albums followed and then came Brave... The fourth being Marbles.<br /><br />But above all those magnificent works, Brave stands on its own: a very cohesive album both lyrically and musically. This is not an easy album to listen to. It's nothing to do with either Lavender, Cover my eyes or Incommunicado. It is just better.<br /><br />It's been 11 years since its inicial release (12 since recording), but it hasn't aged a single note. It's pure prog rock with lots of different musical textures: from the electronic and melancolic Bridge, the rocker Hard as love, the precious piano in The Hollow man, to the celtic-like and very sorrowful Brave, and the beautiful acoustic guitar in Made again. Nonetheless, despite it's own diversity, it's built in such a fluid mode, that the main structure of the album remains perfectly tight.<br /><br />I just can tell you: get it now, you don't know what you've been missing. If you're a fan of epic proportions music, this one won't let you down: it'll thrill you as it does with me.<br /><br />PS: Get this remasters edition with the second CD. It is comprised of left-outs, rehearsals, rare versions, etc. A must-have for true Marillion fans.
B00004WEJZ|4.0|Is this film a rehash of Thunderball? Yes.  Are some of the effects a little cheesy? Yes.  Is it considered an unofficial Bond film because of not originally being on MGM? Yes.  Does any of that matter a damn when you consider that it's Sean Freakin' Connery back in the role of James Bond? ABSOLUTELY NOT!  Even a not so good Connery Bond film is still better than most.  This film delivers most of the things you want out of a Bond film, and the only things it doesn't are due to copyright mumbo jumbo (the most disheartening being the famous gun-hood opening and signature music being missing, and of course, the late great Desmond Llwynne not appearing as Q). Connery is lean and mean in this one, and in fact looks better than he did in Diamonds Are Forver. And beside, this film is way better than the Roger Moore film \\"Octopussy\\", which was released the same year, and for some unGodly reason did better at the box office.  By this time, I think most will agree that Roger Moore was begining to wear out his welcome, and so (since it would be a few more years before the great Timothy Dalton made the role his own) it was a great time for Sir Sean to come back one more time and remind us what James Bond is all about! Cars! Women! Collateral Damage!!  And honestly, I don't think anybody who wasn't told previously would have ever even known that this wasn't and official Bond flick. Watch for a small role played by a young, pre-Mr. Bean Rowan Atkinson!
B000AADYRQ|4.0|It's bewildering that so few are willing to stick to their guns when it comes to Death Cab For Cutie. From what I'd read, I assumed this album would be a catastrophe, coupled with Make Believe as conclusive proof that lovable and lighthearted emo pop had bitten the dust. In this sense, listening to Plans gave me the immense satisfaction to declare these assertions void. Call me nave, but after hearing the album I don't see the cold and calculating eyes that I now imagine behind \\"Undone-The Sweater Song.\\" Plans has so much in common with 2003's wildly acclaimed Transatlanticism that I'm not surprised there was a critical backlash - there usually is with repetition. But frankly, one of this magnitude is inexplicable. <br /> <br />Any praise of Death Cab For Cutie has to start and end with Ben Gibbard's calming yet intriguing voice. His endearing elocution, reedy yet crisp tone, consistency and range - all these make him arguably the most charming singer of the new decade. Not charming in a sophisticated, Frank Sinatra fashion; rather, he's \\"bashful-and-bearing-posies\\" charming. Gibbard's voice shows none of the typical evidence of aging, maturing, wearying or sounding anything but static. Basically, it's reliable, and that was one of the keys to my enjoyment of this album. In both tight pop songs and ballads, Gibbard sounds like a hopeless romantic. It's not that he's optimistic so much that he has an overwhelming belief that the middle ground can be ideal. This may have been what bothered some critics. It's not completely clear-cut like the Strokes and it's not jam-packed like the Fiery Furnaces, and we assume these days that a band must want one or the other. Thus, for some reason some can't appreciate a band that doesn't break pop structure but still adds in a little instrumental flair to keep interest. It's seen as a failure of ambition rather than delicate moderation. <br /> <br />A word should be put in on production, the increased crispness of which many havecorrelated with Gibbard's other 2003 success (it was certainly his year), The Postal Service. Plans certainly doesn't even approach the pop electronica of Give Up, but the album's also virtually devoid of the distorted guitars of \\"The New Year\\" in favor of all sorts of small shiny production morsels like a tuned-up drum pattering a civil war beat, church organs, tinny guitars reminiscent of \\"Losing My Religion\\", and so on and so forth. This lack of grime doesn't particularly bother me. I can't comment on any of Death Cab's early work, but reputedly their early stuff has been called bona fide indie in a way that their newer stuff isn't. Their oldest fans were even a little disappointed by Transatlanticism's semitransparent critic-wooing. I (and here comes the real blasphemy) don't think indie suits Death Cab the way good old pop rock (emo?) does. Once again, this is in part due to Gibbard's voice itself, to which lo-fi production is a great disservice. Death Cab's best moments have always occurred when they don't reach too far (we all respect \\"Transatlanticism\\" a great deal, but it didn't quite fill its eight minutes), and if they ultimately want to be a band that's comforting instead of pioneering, I for one won't stand in their way. <br /> <br />For this album, it's lack of reach rather than ambitious reach that needs to be addressed. Both Transatlanticism and Plans are arranged similarly, loosely frontloaded with the tighter pop songs and filled out towards the end with piano ballads. Whereas compared to Plans the former's pop songs were minimalist and therefore somewhat weak, Plans has exactly the opposite problem: the pop songs at the beginning are very engaging while the tunes in the ballads feel somewhat empty. The distinction is subtle, but because of it the album doesn't carry through quite as nicely as Transatlanticism. Yet I never want to turn it off, because just when I think the melodies start to sound recycled, something new - a bridge, an instrument, afilter, sometimes even a lyric - comes and hooks me once again. <br /> <br />\\"Sometimes even a lyric\\" sounds condescending? Well, Gibbard's lyrics are the number one criticism of the band and the album (the latter confusing me once more, because again there's little change from Transatlanticism). Admittedly, I often agree with the criticisms (\\"cringe-worthy\\" is a frequent description, and I'll attest), but singling out Death Cab for Cutie is a mistake. Listeners who are possibly smarter (or more emotionally mature, what have you) than Gibbard tear the lyrics apart, but then run off to bands that obviously write their lyrics pedantically and/or obscurely to leave room for personal interpretation. There's no evidence that the brainpower of these lyricists somehow outweighs Gibbard, the fact is Gibbard wants his lyrics to be about him and not the listener. To me this is noble; to others the matrix is preferable to reality. So yeah, the lyrics are Middle School, but when you think of the hodgepodge of despicable personalities present in early adolescence, the one of the nice, quiet, somewhat nave kid is comforting in a way, even if it's not really wise. <br /> <br />I'm often excessively (and misleadingly) cantankerous when there's a strong reaction to something that I simply don't consider particularly substantial, and it doubles when there's a paradox as there is for Death Cab's last two albums. Very recently, Plans has unexpectedly started popping up on the occasional 2005 year end list, and at the risk of sounding inconsistent I will stress that the album is nothing to write home about; I had, by and large, a perfectly pleasant time listening to it several times in preparation for this review, and I can assert that the dislike was gratuitous, but it is also far from the best it could have been. In many ways, it forecasts Death Cab for Cutie's future career trajectory, and indicates that there will be lows and highs, but always a clear goal throughout. The bar's up, Ben. Now that you've established your own personal epoch, we can only wait patiently for you to fill its potential. <br /> <br />B
B000BW7QWW|3.0|Is there anyone else disappointed with the DVD?  My copy does not have a chapter list and I think there should be another disc.  The DVD doesn't do the movie justice at all!  Hopefully there will be a 2-disc edition released within the next year or so.   <br /> <br />Oh yes, I love Joss Whedon!
0060934700|5.0|Let me preface this by saying that I loved \\"Neverwhere.\\"  This book of short fictions was incredible. My personal favorites - the little story in the introduction and Nicholas - great reading for the engaged and before Christmas.  Who can forget Murder Mysteries?  What a fantastic collection of stories for anyone who enjoys Gaiman OR SF.
B00004Y6NW|5.0|I won't pretend to know as much about the Dire Straits as other reviewers, and their \\"signature sound\\" and all that, but I do know great music when I hear it.  And this, friends, is an excellent album from start to finish.  Nary a bad cut on the album, it's well worth the money.  My personal favorite is \\"In the Gallery,\\" and of course there are others...\\"Six Blade Knife,\\" \\"Down to the Waterline,\\" and the radio staple \\"Sultans of Swing.\\"  This is a great introduction to a great band, and I highly, HIGHLY recommend this album.  You won't be disappointed.
0780626966|5.0|Even though the boxset doesn't contain any of the deleted scenes from a few of the movies, it is still worth every cent!  Each movie is digitally remastered which makes the viewing experience that much more enjoyable!  The Nightmare Encyclopedia is pretty cool as well. <br /> <br />HINT - their is a part of the labyrinth, I think it's the fire escape.  If you type in the number 20 with your dvd remote,  you can see an alternate ending to part 1. <br /> <br />The only problem with the boxset is Nightmare 5, Dan and Greta's demises.  They were originally intended to be longer and more gory.  The director had to edit them because they would get an X-rating.  Look for the unrated vhs tape (not the re-release, the one with Freddy and the stroller on the cover) to get the full effect!  It's worth it!
B000002BFZ|5.0|Few bands affect me the way Pearl Jam does. Pearl Jam was my introduction to not only grunge but also rock in general so of course I have a soft spot for them. None weaker than I do for No Code though. Vs. is my favorite release from PJ but No Code is the CD that has touched me the most. In my opinion I think this is the most vulnerable PJ has ever been and that will always equal good music. I realize No Code isn't recieved as well as say Ten or Vs. but when given a chance, it's just as strong as any CD Pearl Jam has released.<br /><br />Sometimes is the ideal way to begin, finally Pearl Jam begins a CD with a song they'd begin a concert with. Many people don't think Sometimes is a very good song but I'd beg to differ. Musically, no, it's not PJ's best, but lyrically is where this song shines. Hail, Hail picks up the pace enough to bring the old fans in but is original enough to stand on its own. Who You Are is sure to get you humming along at least once. It will probably go down as the feel good song of the album simply because of how happy the beat is. There's two things you'll probably notice by the time In My Tree starts, 1.) No Code has quite a few slower songs, and 2.) Ed's voice is amazing. I for one have always been very fond of PJ's slower songs and love Ed's voice, so I'm overjoyed by both. In My Tree is a slower song but it's also got an edge to it. Basically it's one of those \\"I'm an outsider\\" songs, but Pearl Jam does the typical songs so well that you don't feel bored by them. Smile is an infectious song that will get stuck in your head and I guarantee you won't mind a bit because this is just a great song. Off He Goes slows down the CD considerably, but if you have listened to any of their live bootlegs you know they like playing it. I think Off He Goes is one of those songs that takes a bit to start liking but once you do you find that you want to hear it all the time. Habit is probably my favorite heavier song on No Code. It took me a while to come to that conclusion but one day I was standing there with it stuck in my head and just decided that it was a really good catchy song. Red Mosquito only furthers the theory that you kind of need to be a true PJ fan to appreciate this CD. Lukin is a good song but is so much better when it's played live. Ed is so much better at singing this live and the band really picks up the pace, so I'd suggest listening to the live versions. Present Tense is the most tearjerking song you'll ever hear. Even if you don't like Pearl Jam just read the lyrics and it'll hit a spot you didn't even know you had. What makes this song so much better than any others on here is the fact that the band seems to put the lyrics and Ed's voice first and then they begin a little jam session towards the end. Not enough good things will ever be said about this song. Mankind is a song I didn't expect from PJ because when you think of Pearl Jam you think of two things, 1.) Ed, and 2.) Mike. So to hear a different vocalist is strange at first. I'm Open is a darker song with spoken word verses and turns into a simple yet effective song. Around The Bend, despite the off-beat feel, is a nice closer with wonderful lyrics.<br /><br />My favorite tracks are Sometimes, Who You Are, Smile, Habit, and Present Tense. I believe in order to really grasp No Code that you do need to like Pearl Jam, but there are songs that the casual fan will fall in love with as well. The criticism this CD has gotten is well deserved. Anyone who is completely trashing this CD obviously hasn't given it a chance to wear on them, but most of the lower rated reviews cite good points. So just know before going in that you'll be surprised by the outcome and you'll be fine.e to that conclusion but one day I was standing there with it stuck in my head and just decided that it was a really good catchy song.

B000BKDOB6|5.0|'Horses' is generally believed to be singer / songwriter Patti Smith's best album. I have owned it for quite some time and I have always had fond feelings for it, but I was prompted to return to listen to it when I discovered a book of recently published Patti Smith poems which also credited her with a rather substantial body of graphic art.<br /><br />This made me convinced that this is a very serious artist who is not simply striking poses. The fact that the album opens and closes with Ms. Smith's interpretations of two of the most iconic songs of the 1960's, Van Morrison's 'Gloria' and Pete Townshend's 'My Generation' simply highlights ho close to these great numbers is her own music, based firmly on the highly original and high octane style of her producer, John Cale's band, The Velvet Underground.<br /><br />Since I just finished reviewing a book with rather abominable photography, I have to plug the exceptional camerawork of leading artist Robert Mapplethorpe.<br /><br />An important neoclassical rock classic.
B00000099Y|5.0|The single greatest ROCK album EVER! Enough said. Take a look at the reviews. Nearly a solid five stars total and this CD has been out for almost 10 years. I listen to this EVERY...SINGLE...DAY. Track 1, 5, 11, and 13 are my favorites. If that doesn't help you buy this, nothing will.
B000BVEKO0|4.0|Fist off, Korn is the best band in nu-metal history. They are the ones who basicly started or brought nu-metal to the masses in the underground before metal ever went mainstream. I've gone through so many reviews of either people praising or bashing one of the most influential bands in rock music history. Korn are legends and they deserve more respect than that of \\"you people\\" that are stuck on one paticular style they brought out in one of their 7 albums. First off, Korn has never really changed. It's you the fans who make it seem like each album they have become something new, that is either praise-worthy or for lack of a better term \\"crap\\". Don't you people have lives? On the TALITM cd, Jonathan sings on the song \\"I'm done\\" and he says \\"I'm done being there for others, they have their pain and so do I\\". That right there should signaled something to you the fans that the man is tired of carrying you on his back and making music for \\"you\\" to feel better. You guys who are like so obsessed with Korn and you need to grow up, literally. Jonathan, as much crap as he's been through, he is really starting to mature into a adutlt and yet all \\"you\\", the \\"fans\\" have to say is that he isn't the same anymore. And for all fans out there that say that Korn was better when they first came out with songs like blind, ball tongue, and adidas, and all the other early 90's material, Jonathan Davis and the entire band were still practically teenagers. So, you throw slurs at them because now their mature adults and no longer write about things that affected them when they were teens, com' on? I could go all day writing about how stupid and immature you guys really are but I'm not going to. My purpose is to review \\"See You On The Other Side\\" cd which is by the way awesome work from Korn.  <br /> <br />First off, Korn has never put out \\"one\\" bad album. Everyone of them has been good in their own right. The first album is special and is probably their best work to date. Life is Peachy onlycontinued the trend of the first album but never really equaled the quality of the self-titled debut. Follow The Leader was the album that launced them into the mainstream and was very enjoyable especially to those that weren't familiar with them. Issues, was darker and them redifining themselves into darker and more melodic tunes. Untouchables was their come back from a 3-year break and it also had a lot of experimentation and it was their album to mix both the heavy and melodic weird stuff that they do. TALITM was them as quoting, getting back to the basics and going back to the heavy grooves that made the first album so successful. And now, See You On The Other Side. This album is amazing! There's no denying it. I'll agree that it's a different album than their previous albums but nothing really drastic in change. Head leaving the band was probably the best thing that happened to Korn. They were so stuck on pleasing you the fans that they were starting to lose the creative edge that made them into who they are today; rock legends. This is their best since the first ablum \\"Korn\\". You people who gave it bad reviews didn't like it because it didn't make you feel the \\"old\\" feelings you had when you listened to them back in day. That was basicly like 12-14 years ago, it's over, Korn is no longer living a little more than a decade ago into the past. You can't expect them to stay the same. And in my opinion, I don't think they've changed all that much anyway. Bottomline, this new record is tight and should not be missed by any Korn fan. It's easily there best work since their self-titled debut. My favorite tracks on this cd are all of them. This is Korn's second classic album. I urge all of you who are true korn fans to go out and support the band on this insanely awesome effort from a band that has been through so much and are still the kings of the genre that they pioneered forefronted.
B00005QZ7U|5.0|At first I was skeptical that Nicole Kidman could pull this off, but boy was I wrong.  She not only pulled it off but soared as Satine the bad girl with bog dreams in 19th century Paris.  The chemistry between her and Ewan McGregor's Christian, a naive writer who goes to the red light district to find 'truth, beauty, freedom and above all love' against his fathers advice, is intoxicating.  With a stellar cast and an amazing mix of old and new pop songs this brilliant musical makes you not only want to sing and dance, but love with every fiber of your being.  I highly recommend this amazing and timeless love story to everyone.
B000BTC5LW|4.0|Finally I got my copy. I watched it eagerly from start to end including the additional extras. No doubt about the concert; this is one of the top-5 best concerts ever. It's a pity that the video transfer didn't have better quality. As David Gilmore explained, the concert was initially shot in video, not in film, and that was OK for the VHS at that time; they had a hard time transferring it to DVD because the quality was not up to today's standards; I wasn't expecting a miracle but it was dissapointing to see that the image has so many flaws. Besides, the screen films are presented in round format, which may be OK for the concert but these are actually videos that should have been added to the 2 videos included in this DVD. I have to say though, that the sound is outstanding.<br /><br />The performances are great and I was very impressed with Guy Pratt, the bass player, for his fenomenal interpretation in all PF songs, being the \\"run like hell\\" performance his summit.<br /><br />This concert is a rock music historical masterpiece worth having even if the visuals are not perfect.
B000BVD460|4.0|Eminem is probably one of the best, most blatant law-floundering rappers in the industry, and palpably unique. (duh!) His albums, The Slim Shady LP, The Eminem show, The Marshall Mathers LP, were all rap music classics. Encore, however, a headfirst plunge into oblivion, as it was chock-full of deliberate, flagrant nonsense (no offense to those who like it, this is just my opinion).  <br /> <br />That aside, this album features most of his hits from his first two albums, 3 from Encore (thankfully, those songs are decent enough), 3 from The Eminem show, Lose Yourself (which is undoubtedly his best song ever done), the haunting, uncertain future of Em's and rather touching \\"When I'm gone\\", the cockamamy \\"Fack\\", the slightly embarassing but catchy \\"Shake That\\" plus his infamous duet with Elton John at the 2001 Grammys, Stan (live). A good selection of his hits, though I just feel that SOMETHING is missing. (his songs on his albums which were NOT released as singles) <br /> <br />The music aside, there is no doubt fans of Eminem will treat this album as a gem in their treasure of CDs.  <br /> <br /> <br />Whether he is retiring or not, Eminem never fails to be out of people's thoughts with his good and bad ways, his trademark for his ever-so-controversial lyrics about his hatred for two women (Kim and Debbie), whom we all know so well, his unconditional love for daughter Hailie Jade, and slandering other big name celebs, just to get more than a few laughs with the public, is also Mr Mather's blatant trademark.  <br /> <br /> <br />One thing I'd like to note; Eminem's best tunes are during the times when he is serious about certain issues or angry about something, which was his key to his success in carving out a distinctive and whole new perspective of rap music, with predecessor Dr Dre. While his deliberate hint-dropping everywhere seem to depict Em's retirement, the legacy of his music, lyrics, quotes, attitude towards certain entities still and forever will live on.

0307236722|5.0|I know that several other reviewers have already called this book a baking bible and I have to agree 100%!  My first review of this book mysteriously disappeared after about a month so I'm trying it again.  (maybe because I mentioned where it could be purchased elsewhere for less...?)<br /><br />This book makes it so easy whether you're an amateur or an old pro -- I'm somewhere between.  The recipes and instructions make it so simple to duplicate them in taste and presentation.  The presentation part is very important to me for some reason.  (I guess I want all of my hard work to *look* as good as it tastes)<br /><br />The general baking tips, techniques and equipment lists are very helpful.  I am acquiring a decent size library of Martha's books and this one is a great addition.  Even though it's a completely different shape than the others.  (smaller & fatter)  Maybe this is how they will be made from now on. (?)<br /><br />Anyway -- it's a very helpful and visually appealing book.  I like to just sit and look and read through it like it's a big beautiful magazine -- I get a lot of extra tips this way too.<br /><br />All in all a great purchase that will most definitely be used for many years to come.

I honestly don't know whether I love these books because I love mythology and fantasy or whether I love mythology and fantasy because of these books.  If you haven't read these books then do so in the order that they were released by Lewis. If you only read them as a child then read them again.  Other books and series I have enjoyed are the Lord of the Rings, Harry Potter, the book of the Dun cow by Walter Wangerin and Ascent of the Gods by A C Torres.
B00005QW5X|4.0|I don't know what's more incredible, that rock musicals keep getting better or that the best rock musicals focus on sexual ambiguity.     \\"Hedwig and the Angry Inch\\" outshines it's processor \\"Rocky Horror\\" in a number of arenas, it's better acted, the music is stronger, and the plot is far from campy. Well, it's a little campy but it's also sad and somewhat tragic, making this a very grown up rock opera.    John Cameron Mitchell plays Hedwig (formally Hansel) Robinson, a young German man who escapes Berlin with the help of an American serviceman. The two are lovers and Hansel must become Hedwig if he is to make it past the U.S. inspectors. So an operation is had, but the results are less than satisfying. Hedwig makes it to America, but there's still an inch of Hansel left. Hedwig is eventually abandoned by his/her lover. He/She experiments with music and soon mentors future rock star Tommy Gnosis. The movie starts with Hedwig far from being a \\"has been\\". Hedwig is a \\"never was\\" and is only able to score gigs at  roadside Holiday Inns. All the while Hedwig's discipline, Tommy Gnosis, is a mega star, making millions off the very songs Hegwig wrote.     We learn about Hedwig's life through the movie's songs and through effective flashbacks. There is much pain in Hedwig's life and the result turn him/her into a bitter bitch who only seems to find motivation in bringing everyone else around him/her crashing down. The end of the movie provides a sort of showdown between Hedwig and Gnosis. Hedwig gets his/her chance at fame but more importantly, Hedwig gets  a shot at enlightenment. Is he Hedwig? Is he Hansel? Is he Gnosis? Or is he something else...something he's been looking for since before he was anything. So, yes, the ending is complicated but the real meat to this movie is the journey Hedwig takes.
0307276902|5.0|By far the best book I've ever read, it was just phenominal.  So much in fact that I cannot describe it here, you just have to read it for yourself.
B00025ETIW|1.0|[...] The main songs I have heard on the radio are godawful. [...] This guy I work with brought this and played it for me. The songs all sound the same, whining and moaning of topics suited for 12 year old girls. [...] Just avoid this weak and overrated album which sounds like everything else.
0156027321|1.0|I don't understand what all the fuss is about... I have read my fair share of books in my lifetime, and I can honestly say this is one of the WORST i have EVER read. Like many of the other people who gave this book less than 4 stars, I thought Life of Pi was horribly boring and utterly pointless. It started off well enough-- with an interesting story of a boy who belongs to three seperate religions. You would think that his journey at sea would end up teaching him something profound about religion, alas, the book teaches him, and the reader, absolutely nothing of value. A majority of the book is the main character babbling about catching fish and staying out of the sun. I can't even begin to express how dissapointed I was with this book. Don't waste your time...
B0001XAPX8|5.0|This is a film that is a masterpiece not only for what it says but in the way it says it. <br /> <br />We have a man who looks white but is black, pretends to be a Jew, and lives a life of deception. We have a woman with a background that gives her every advantage but she is destroyed because she was molested as a child due to her ravishing beauty.  At the very moment when these two finally find peace in each other's arms they are wiped out by the insanity of evil.   <br /> <br />Coleman's story unfolds in a series of perplexing flashbacks that leaves the viewer confounded until we finally discover that Coleman Silk and the black boxer are one and the same.  Faunia's story is equally confusing. It is unreasonable that this utterly gorgeous young woman is so casually willing to give herself sexually to a rejected Viagra dependant old man. Why is she merely scraping out a living for herself sweeping floors and feeding cattle when you sense that she has so much more to offer?  What horror has brought her to this state of despair?  As her story unfolds in her final soliloquy with a caged crow  we find that she is so haunted by the blame she feels for the accidental death of her children, while she was distracted with a lover, that she is suicidal, emotionally detached, and devastated. <br /> <br />Into this mix vengeance pursues Faunia in the form of her ex-husband, a tortured Viet Nam vet for whom killing has become a casual exercise. Lester Farley is a clever mixture of blind fate and conscious hate that only the writer, Zuckerman, ultimately understands and reveals to the world.   <br /> <br />What makes this film so artfully intriguing is the way the story unfolds in its seemingly chaotic fashion reflecting the chaos of the human condition the film is describing, and it is a story that is hard to take because it rings so heartbreakingly true.  The acting by the principals, Hopkins, Kidman, Sinise, Harris,and Miller is utterly outstanding in every way, and the film deserves repeated viewings from that standpoint alone.  As for the story itself, it takes a couple of viewings with patience and reflection to fully appreciate its authentic depths. Finally, in an ironic way, one might take comfort from Coleman's and Faunia's deaths that the moment at which they died was the moment at which they had reached fulfillment with each other.  <br /> <br />
B0002T7ZKW|5.0|I've been listening to punk rock since the supposed punks writing some of these reviews were less than a twinkle in their parent's eyes.  Although this album is not as punk rock as some of the previous, the album is mature and well made.  I'm extremely impressed!  And, punk rock is a frame of mind, not a look or a fad!  And this album is DEFINITELY punk rock!  The maturity in this album is obvious.  I think that Green Day was finally able to say what they think and make an album that isn't necessarily in line with the demands of a record label.  And they've earned the right with years of great releases.  The lyrics are awesome.  You MUST look beyond the surface.  Allow your brain to exercise a bit people!  The meanings of these songs are not on the surface.  If you get this album be sure to really read and listen to the lyrics.  There's a lot to be said.  And, its a great album for ALL ages, despite some language.  My eleven year old is a huge fan.  And if you're a parent, really take a listen.  This album goes out to us adults!  Our kids aren't stupid, and if we don't pull it together we're going to really F*#K up this world for them.  But at the very least....ENJOY THIS ALBUM!
B00003JRCQ|5.0|Persuasion and Pride and Prejudice are my favorite Austen books.      Persuasion is a quiet story written near the end of Austen's life.   It is about a young woman, Anne Elliot, who is persuaded to give up the man she loves because he has no means to provide for her.     Years later he comes back with money and position (a Captain of the Navy) while her fortunes have lessened.  She has never gotten over him, he has never forgiven her for her rejection.     This movie does a fine job of capturing all the emotional nuances of the book.     The two leads do a marvelous job at conveying to the viewer their past history and the emotional toll it has taken upon them both.    The scene when Wentworth walks in on Mary and Anne as they are eating breakfast, the first time they've seen each other since their broken engagement, is thick with tension.   The resentment is washing off of Wentworth in waves, while Anne is almost overcome.     While Wentworth courts Lousia, his anger to Anne is front and center.  It is as if he is saying to her \\"See what you gave up? I don't need or want you anymore.\\"   Yet he still cares if she suffers, as the scene where he asks his sister to take her back to Uppercross illustrates.  We feel Anne's shock and his discomfort that he would care she is tired.     The pivotal scene when Harville and Anne are debating who loves longest, man or woman, is brilliant.  Both characters convey such depth of emotion yet respect for the other.     The scene where Anne reads Wentworth's declaration of love is beautiful.  The director had both actors read the letter so we hear both of their voices.  Wentworth's voice is full of frustration,passion and hope.  Anne's voice begins incredulous and evolves in to joy.      The only complaint I have is the Mrs. Smith subplot.  I wished they had left it intact, as it provides a richer texture to Anne's realization of just who Mr. Elliot really is.     I appreciated the nod to Austen's original ending (which she thankfully changed to include one my favorite love letters in literature) with the inclusion of Wentworth having a comission from the Admiral to find out where Anne and Mr. Elliot plan to live after they marry.     Root is not a Hollywood beauty, but while Anne Elliot is supposed to be pretty, time and disappointment has ravaged her looks.  I thought she captured Anne perfectly.     This is my favorite screen adaptation of an Austen book. It is very true to the reflective spirit of the novel.
B000BKJ78U|5.0|The DVD editions are way better than the original films! What's the point of wanting the original films released in the seventies? Yes, I was born in the nineties and the first Star Wars film that I saw was Episode I, but the DVD versions are in fact superior to the editions first released. Not only is the picture quality more pristine and crisp, but the CGI added to these editions helps with the continuity to the prequel trilogy. These are the films the way George Lucas envisioned them, he even admits this. He believes that the films released first were only about half of what he wanted them to be, and I agree totally. Trust me, these editions are WAY BETTER than the original films. I hope that George Lucas NEVER re-releases the old versions on DVD, that would be a BIG mistake. Just because the original editions were the ones you adults saw as children doesn't means that us younger generation should have to watch them. We need to look forward instead of backwards. The original editions belong in a museum somewhere. Go out and buy these DVDs. You'll be glad you did.
B0000AM6JI|4.0|\\"Carlitos Way\\" stars Al Pacino as the Main character, Carlito Brigante, who has just been released from prison after 5 years and has decided to clean up his life.  His lawyer is played by Sean Penn and is the one responsible for finding the loopholes that free him.  Carlito is forever in debt to this man, whom also happens to be a longtime friend of his. <br />The movie depicts what life is like for Carlito now that he is no longer associated with any crime families.  Obviously, none of the other criminals believe him, but he is very convincing and after awhile, even the cops don't question his \\"straight-shooting\\".  Well, things take a turn for the worse and of course it is because of his lawyer, but I'll let you all watch for that. <br /> <br />Overall, the movie is really enjoyable.  I especially like Luis Guzman's character, Pachinga.  First off, I always enjoy Guzman, but this character fits him like a glove.  John Leguizamo also has a role in the film as Benny Blanco and is convincing in his role.  The only negative I found in this film was the love story between Carlito and Gail.  It just drags some of the scenes out and really does not add anything to the film.  \\"Scarface\\" was similiar at times, but the ending made the love scence(actually in \\"Scarface\\" they were argueing scenes) understandable.  This film does not. <br /> <br />Still, this is an excellent movie and certainly worth a viewing. <br />Enjoy!!
0380733358|5.0|I thought this was a good book. Follett developed the characters well throughout the book. His writing style makes the book easy and fun to read. It is an exciting book that I would recommend to others interested in spy/mystery/action novels. 4B Max T.
B000AYQJJ2|1.0|This dvd was just awful.  I thought I would purchase this dvd for my father. Well big mistake that was!!!  This was back in his era and a few big names. It was the biggest waste of money.  They are all on lsd, high as kites and could not get a note out if it killed them.  <br /> <br />All the reviews said great but now I know not to take notice.  Please spend your money on something else worth while.
044022425X|4.0|My fianc&eacute; started reading Outlander at my request recently so I decided to pick up Drums of Autumn and give it a go-ahead again. I had tried reading it a couple of years ago and had gotten halfway through it when something distracted me. This happens often with Diana's books. It's not that they aren't riveting, they are. But the piece-by-piece way that she writes sometimes makes for the mind to wander in certain parts of her books. Their size is often an invitation to that also. Of course, my ADD could make this ten times worse but my mind wandered. However, this time, when I drove right in, I read it from cover to cover in a week or two. It was great! Gabaldon is amazing! I've enjoyed every book that she's written so far and Drums is no exception.<br /><br />Take no heed to the folks who say it's slow. The thing about Diana's books is that they have their own pace. They are not at a breakneck speed they whole way through. Sections of them might be but as a whole, the book has it's own pace. There's a lot of ground that needs to be covered in this book. When you're finished, you'll see: a lot happens in this book! I find myself excited about starting the Fiery Cross just to see what she's going to do with the upcoming Revolutionary War! It's a fascinating time and to see it from the point-of-view of the Fraziers' sounds exciting to me.<br /><br />If you are new to the Outlandish books, go back to the original Outlander and dive in. If you are unsure about starting this new part of the series, the Americas, instead of the three other Scottish books, give it a try. I don't think you will be let down. I wasn't.
B000B7HZXM|1.0|Few, if any, have accused Rod Stewart of having any artist integrity over the past 30 years.  That was when he decided that being a \\"rock star\\" and dating super models was more important than artistic honesty and he took his powerful voice away from the bluesy rock he was making and put both feet squarely in MOR land with utterly dreadful songs like \\"Tonight's the Night,\\" \\"Passion,\\" \\"Infatuation,\\" and the completely horrendous \\"Do Ya Think I'm Sexy.\\" To this day it remains, quite possibly, the single most appalling sellout in rock history. <br /> <br />With baby boomers having long since aged out of the target demographic of radio, folks like Stewart had to find a new schtick, and viola! cover albums of standards were born.  So now we have acts like Stewat churning out album after album after album (after album) of covers of songs their parents listened to and that they (the boomers) loathed in their youth.  Obviously it causing the cash registers to ring or otherwise there would not be so many of them, but Stewart is now on his fourth go around of this tiresome formula and it is simply time to take a stand and say ENOUGH ALREADY.  Please.  Somebody put a stop to this. <br /> <br />Destined for dentist offices across America.
B00003CWL6|3.0|\\"American Beauty\\" is certainly one of the most beautifully filmed movies of its time, and contains a number of great performances from actors like Chris Cooper and Kevin Spacey. Watching it, it's easy to be drawn in by the visuals and the stunning score. But behind all that lies an empty script that offers no insights, no development, and most of all, no subtlety.<br /><br />From the beginning we're told by the narrator that he's a dead man- so what from that point, we're just waiting to see how exactly he buys it. It's a cheap trick, and one that removes much of the need to develop the plot; we're left with a number of trivial stories that don't tell us anything or advance the plot. When Spacey's death comes, it's like the punchline to a bad joke.<br /><br />There are three narrative threads in this film, none of which gets developed very far: Early on, Spacey's character decides to stop caring about success and becomes infatuated with a teenaged girl. His wife (Anette Benning in her usual stiff attempt at acting) looks elsewhere for money and affection. Their daughter looks for love from the neighborhood dope dealer, who lives with a stereotypically emotionally numb mother and a father who's a caricature of the retired military non-com. And that's really it.<br /><br />The story unfolds in a very stagey and unnatural way, relying on  music and an excess of gimmicky camera shots to make the transition from one scene to the next. There's an unnaturalness about the whole enterprise that really keeps the viewer from becoming emotionally involved with any of the characters. It's not unlike watching an ant farm.<br /><br />So three stars for the score and the peformances by Cooper and Spacey, and none for the story or direction.
B0001CCXY8|5.0|This is one of my favorite Cannibal Corpse albums in my collection. I bought it on the day of its release along with Deicide's Scars Of The Crucifix and the re-issue of Disincarnate's Dreams Of The Carrion Kind. I have never had a problem getting anything Cannibal Corpse but getting this album or better yet, getting the uncensored version digipack was a pain in the a--. I went to an FYE/Spec's store and they only had the censored version. I asked a clerk why the store didn't have it and he said that they could order it but they didn't carry it. They only carried the censored version. This was very unfortunate because they carry all Cannibal Corpse releases and I always see them at their store locations but not the uncensored version of The Wretched Spawn. It's probably because of the cover but in any case, it is a travesty and a violation of the first amendment. After this, I went to the Virgin Megastore nearby and they didn't have the uncensored version either but this was a different case because it was about availablity instead of censorship. So I go on to another FYE/Spec's location and it was the same deal as the first one and since it was the day of the release of the album and many fans were buying it, I didn't want to feel left out. So I went on and bought the censored version. I did enjoy the album a whole lot like with every album that Cannibal Corpse releases but it was a major shame in the way that things turned out. So I tried looking for the uncensored in other FYE/Spec's locations and it was the same deal until I finally went back to the Virgin Megastore that I went before only this time, I found the uncensored digipack. I brought 2 copies as a measure of revenge.  <br /> <br />I'm sorry if I have caused any discomfort by telling this story but I'm doing this to call many Cannibal Corpse fans and extreme metal fans in general to arms. I don't know for sure but I believe that this problem with stores like FYE/Spec's was the reason for the release of The Wretched Spawn/Worm Infeasted EP boxset. At least fans can get the uncensored copy but measures still need to be taken by fans as well as the band and their record label in order to prevent this from ever happening again. This is just another major wake-up call and it is something that many of you Cannibal brothers and sisters should take heed.  <br /> <br />Now for my review. This is the 10th studio album by the band and it comes in a digipack which features the CD album itself and a DVD which is the making of the album. So everything here will satisfy every Cannibal Corpse desire and a whole lot more. Lets review everything one by one. <br /> <br />1. The Album - With this album, it is another new direction for the band. They take things to another new level. The band still retains all of the basic elements that have made them who they are as a brutal death metal force but to a more progressive, dynamic and creative level. In other words, they are becoming better musicians because what they do musically makes them stand almost superior over the average gore death metal band because they are the only ones who can do what they do, how they do it and no one does it better. It's just that simple and this keeps being the case album by album and it certainly is the case here without a doubt. So with this album, there is plenty of heaviness, brutality, speed, slow and medium-paced songs, aggression, solos, bass, blast beats and killer vocals as well as innovative passages, distortions and a whole lot of unbelievable suprises. So nothing predictable here. As for the material, the direction of it is almost like Bloodthirst but more progressive and innovative but with the sinister vibe of Vile. The key word here is suprise. So you're just going to have to listen to it and see for yourself but all I can say is prepare to be slain. Some of the best songs here are Severed Head Stoning, Psychotic Precision, Decency Defied, Frantic Disembowelment, The Wretched Spawn, FesteringIn The Crypt, Nothing Left To Mutilate and They Deserve To Die. So buy it and experience some heavy, brutal, wretched death metal curtesy of the spawns known as Cannibal Corpse. Enjoy the wretchedness. <br /> <br />2. The DVD - The DVD is something extra for the true Corpse fans to enjoy. It features a whole of awesome things but it mainly focuses on the making of the album. So some of the things seen here are interviews with the band members, the band practicing Frantic Disembowelment, Rotted Body Landside and Festering In The Crypt, Jack playing accustic country, George cooking and working out, Pat and Alex out shooting, the guy's own private rooms and much more. Now I don't know if this edition of the album with the CD and DVD is a limited edition but just in case it is, I strongly recommend on buying this edition of the album now. Buy 2, 3 or 4 if you have to but just don't miss out.
B000A2RRF4|4.0|Yes, I'm a HUGE MJ Fan, have been for 20+ years now, but I don't know about buying the DVD to the Bucharest tour. It's nice to see it, but I don't think I'll buy it. Simply because I have the original recording of the Bucharest tour when it came on HBO 13 years ago. A friend of mine had HBO at the time and recorded it and let me borrow it. Well, 13 years later I still have it so I don't need the DVD. I crack up every time I want to see a certain performance and the people in the audience cry and scream and faint, and pass out all over the place. I wonder sometimes if these same people are still fans of MJ now???
0688152023|3.0|The content of this book is OK, but the quality of the book is poor. After relatively little use, the binding fell apart and most of the pages are loose, so it's extremely inconvenient to use.
B000002G85|5.0|I cant believe most only gave this alb---CD 4 stars. If you play rock or blues guitar, or just like that type of music, pick this one up. When Clapton was young,and let it all rip out. That strange feeling you get while listening to it is normal, chills down the spine.
B00000637V|5.0|I pulled this out tonite for some background music. This is a work of art....It still stands up very well.I bought this in 1973 and somewhat took me time to understand the concept after Tranformer.It was nothing short of a rock opera about living in New York.
0553801503|2.0|Well, I am very, very glad I waited and read a library copy. I would have been disgusted to have spent money to acquire this tome.    This is an unrelentingly dreary, bleak, grim novel with absolutely no joy or happiness in it. At least not that I could see because I started skipping large parts of very dull, sadistic chapters. And, toward the middle, all of Brienne's pointless wandering, as well as the Ironborn segments. Finally, I found Mr. Martin's preoccupation with rape, sadism and zombies pretty disturbing...    As many have pointed out, this is just a filler novel. Rather than splitting the original book in two, GRRM would have been better advised to have edited it into a single tight novel (with ALL the characters) which has a beginning, a middle and an end. To do this, however, requires self discipline and a willingness to work within a determined format-much as poets  write within the established parameters of, say,a sonnet or haiku, rather than rambling free verse. Unfortunately, I fear Mr. Martin has lost his self discipline and has become self indulgent (one glance at his website will tell you that!).    Unless Mr. Martin pays any attention to these \\"less than sterling\\" reviews-and I seriously doubt he will-I confidently assume Book #5-Dance of Dragons-will be more of the same, only different characters. Boring, tedious and pedestrian.    Oh, and I hope the series is resolved in my lifetime....

B00003CXMG|5.0|Cameron Crowe has without a doubt made many great films (though his recent work has been lacking), but it's no contest which of his films is his masterpiece: \\"Almost Famous\\". Funny, inspiring, and at times heartwarming, and backed by one of the best soundtracks ever, \\"Almost Famous\\" is a cinematic masterpiece that I would place right up there along with \\"Goodfellas\\" and \\"The Godfather\\". IT IS MY FAVORITE MOVIE.<br /><br />The film (based on Crowe's younger day) takes place in 1973. William Miller (Patrick Fugit) is a 15 year old amateur rock journalist for Cream Magazine. Mentored by world renowned rock writer Lester Bangs (a perfectly snide Philip Seymour Hoffman), he is given by the biggest assignment of his life. He is hired by Rolling Stone to pen an article of the up and coming rock band Stillwater. He is sent out on tour with them, much to the dismay of his overprotective mother (the always wonderful Francis McDormand). He becomes close with the band, but mostly with the band's disillusioned and drug addicted guitarist, Russell Hammond (Billy Crudup). He also meets the woman who will change his life: \\"band aid\\" Penny Lane (Kate Hudson, who steals the show). Over the course of the tour, William does a lot of growing up, and learns of the harsh realities of the music industry. By the time the tour is over, he is no longer the 15 year old boy he was when he left.<br /><br />This movie is amazing. The cast is wonderful, and the soundtrack is the greatest ever put onto a film (this can be said for several of Crowe's film soundtracks). \\"Almost Famous\\" is a film you'll want to watch again and again.
B00005JNEI|4.0|Let's face it. Chances are you are going to either love or hate this film before you've even seen it. Personally, I liked it a great deal. I liked the fact that Michael Moore uses the politicians' own videotaped words to indict them, but I also disliked the insinuation in the film that American soldiers were jar-heads who enjoyed or were callous about the killing and suffering of ordinary Iraqis as a result of the war. His final thought in the film is an important one - after all the lies told about why we went to Iraq, why would anybody ever trust us again? Also, and somewhat off-topic, I have to wonder how it is that Michael Moore was able to see the damage that such quotable quotes from conservative politicians could do, and yet then-presidential candidate John Kerry could not? If I had been running Mr. Kerry's campaign I would have been constantly rewinding and replaying the moment when President Bush is speaking at a fundraiser talking about \\"his base - also known as the haves and the have mores\\". What could have done more damage to the President's faux image as some average Joe who enjoys clearing brush on his ranch in Texas? At any rate, I think this is an important film and is worth viewing - just realize that this IS Michael Moore we are talking about and that he does like to go over the top sometimes.

B0000DD7LB|5.0|The Princess of Pop is now an adult. She has had to leave the rather teenage bubblegum pop and venture into the world of rather dancier pop music. She already accomplished it two years ago with \\"Britney\\", and has come back for more with the \\"Britney Spears record from outer space\\". My personal favorites are the first seven tracks, \\"Brave New Girl\\", \\"Everytime\\", the included Me Against the Music remix, and the bonus track \\"The Answer\\". I wish that I had the one with \\"Don't Hang Up\\" and \\"I've Just Begun Having My Fun\\", though. Britney has really shown her songwriting here: she co-wrote around 75% of the tracks in this album (shame that she didn't co-write her best hit from this album, Toxic). I wish that \\"Toxic\\" and \\"Everytime\\" became #1, though.
0670033375|3.0|I don't know how disciplined this book was, given that Diamond tended to wander, at times aimlessly, around the globe searching for examples of societies that had succeeded or failed based on sustainable patterns of living.  There was much in the way of anecdotal observations, often very interesting, about Greenland, Papua New Guinea and Easter Island that wetted my appetitie for more information, but Diamond tended to skip lightly over his subject matter, leaving it up to the reader to search out more information.  As a result, the book is really no more than fodder for discussion than it is a set of case studies on sustainable living.<br /><br />He tries to give the book immediacy by relating his research to his present day experiences in Montana, illustrating that we are making many of the same mistakes that led to the downfall of great civilizations of the past. The big battle, as he correctly notes, is over water.  Without it, any civilization is at a loss to sustain its development, but once again he treads lightly over the subject, which is the most important issue facing us right now.  Water rights remain a major sticking point in most international disputes.<br /><br />It is not to say that Diamond doesn't have an eye for detail, he presents compelling views of the internicine fights that led to the collapse of the formerly great civilization on Easter Island, and examines how Greenland failed and Iceland succeeded despite having similarly inhospitable climates. However, given Diamond's reputation I found myself longing for a deeper examination of the subject material, maybe even focusing specifically on a handful of case studies, which best exemplified his thesis that societies succeeded or failed based on their ability to maintain a sustainable pattern of living.
B0006284JQ|5.0|Honestly. Why on earth would so many people write horrible reviews about Britney Spears music? Do they not see the beauty within the sexy exterior? She is first in line to the throne of Pop Queen! The Queen Herself (Madonna) has taught Britney everything. So what if she does something wrong? We're all human. God gave Britney this personality as a music star! I really just don't know why \\"From the Bottom of My Broken Heart\\", her TOP 20 hit, was excluded, despite the fact that the album is only around 60-67 minutes long. Maybe because it was released in US only...? I also think that they should include \\"Don't Let Me be the Last To Know\\"... <br /> <br />Note: I have the international version, which has two more songs, \\"Born to Make You Happy\\" and \\"I Love Rock & Roll\\". <br /> <br />1. My Prerogative: Quite nice, but it's not me. I wish it became Top 10 like the original Bobby Brown version (which in fact was #1).... 9/10 <br /> <br />2. Toxic: There has never been a greater song for 2003-2004. It may be too sexy, but it rocks! Cathy Dennis is a great songwriter. Wonder why it hasn't become #1 in the Hot 100... 10/10 <br /> <br />3. I'm a Slave 4 U: Fell in love with the song when I first listened to it. It's so cute. It may be her first real sexy song, and I don't care if it's \\"the most un-Britney sounding song she has\\". I wish it was #1... 10/10 <br /> <br />4. Oops!...I Did It Again - Yeah, she did it again: she's given us another reason why we should use our allowance to buy her CD. Know why? The songs are cool, especially in her first 2 albums. I only wonder why this song wasn't #1 in the Hot 100. 10/10 <br /> <br />5. Me Against the Music - Not perhaps a Britney \\"love-love\\" song, but great nonetheless. It's a la \\"It's Like That\\", when you just wanna go out and have fun (especially by dancing). Wish it went top 10...10/10 <br /> <br />6. Stronger - She definitely is stronger than \\"yesterday\\". I don't know why, but it sounds very same to \\"Oops!'. They also sound different at the same time. 10/10 <br /> <br />7. Everytime - I think it sounds more Un-Britney than \\"I'm a Slave 4 U\\". I just can't imagine Britney singing a very slow ballad with just a pianist as her musician. I still love it, and I also wonder why it didn't go #1. The message is also haunting. 10/10 <br /> <br />8. ...Baby One More Time - What can I say? Hit me baby one more time? This is the song that sealed Britney's fate as a Pop Princess in line for the Queen. I get addicted to the song and I keep playing it over and over. It sounds very summer-ish, and I'm shocked, cause it should have stayed MUCH MUCH longer at #1. 10/10 <br /> <br />9. (You Drive Me) Crazy [Stop Remix] - Yeah, also love it. It's another signature song of hers, I think... is it? The remix sounds much better than the original version too. I only STOP to think why not even one of the two versions have gone Hot 100 #1. 10/10 <br /> <br />10. Boys [Co-Ed Remix] - How cute. Co-ed remix, because Pharrell adds the line \\"Girls\\". And the video is awesome (Yeah Baby Yeah). I don't like the original version much, come to think of it... This one rocks! 10/10 <br /> <br />11. Sometimes - Sometimes I think. Why is it NOT another #1 on the Hot 100? The song sounds very nice, you know, and very Baby One More Timeish. 10/10 <br /> <br />12. Overprotected - My favorite track from BRITNEY. The message is nice, seeing how I was strongly affected by it last year... The tune sounds very cool too! Why is it not #1, and why does the original version have \\"The Dark Child Remix Radio Edit\\" on the CD? 10/10 <br /> <br />13. Lucky - Cute plot. I don't like to think what would happen if Britney were Lucky (that's her alter ego). Why on earth are there two Britneys in the video? Should've used Jamie Lynn as Lucky. Why isn't this a #1 on Hot 100? LOL. 10/10 <br /> <br />14. Outrageous - Like I'm a Slave 4 U, like R. Kelly. It sounds very Arabian. Sadly, this is the track I like least on the album. And I also feel very sorryfor Britney, because it is on this video that she broke her knee and was disabled for several months, consequently, it has no video, but clips of the finished parts. 9/10 <br /> <br />15. Born to Make You Happy - Yeah, I agree with the message. She was born to make US happy also! It sounds like the first two albums put together... Once again, why isn't this a #1 on the Hot 100? 10/10 <br /> <br />16. I Love Rock & Roll - She does sound a rock artist, but she is better as a pop princess. The chorus sounds great and I love to imitate her! 10/10 <br /> <br />17. I'm Not a Girl, Not Yet a Woman - Sounds quite weird when put as one of the closing tracks. Should've placed it as Track 2, in my opinion. The message of the song does confirm the fact that Britney suddenly changed her music style between \\"Oops!\\" and \\"Britney\\". Would I want to be in that mountain she was in? Why, yes! I only don't get why it wasn't a #1 on the Hot 100. 10/10 <br /> <br />18. I've Just Begun (Having My Fun) - Has she? No, it already started 1998! It's so-so, but it's not among my most favorite Britney songs. It sounds BRITNEY-ish, but they put it in \\"the zone\\". 9/10 <br /> <br />19. Do Somethin' - Tsk tsk tsk. It's a cool song, yes, but Britney says \\"F***\\" twice in the song. I don't care, though. It's very nice, you see, and it sounds like Me Against the Music, Toxic and Oops! put together. Why didn't they release it earlier, so that the video could be included in the Greatest Hits My Prerogative DVD? 10/10 <br /> <br />This is my most favorite album ever!
B00005JLEU|1.0|the animation was impressive, but the plot line and characters were very strange. No-Face was really creepy, and so were many of the other characters. WEIRD!
B00004SCX6|5.0|Oops! She did it again. And she has. This album is the fastest-selling ever one by a woman. I have the Australian version, with three bonus tracks: \\"Girl in the Mirror\\", which is my most favorite Britney song ever (well, maybe not with \\"...Baby One More Time\\" around), a remake of the classic 80's hit \\"You Got It All\\" (by The Jets), and a lovely Dear Diary-ish ballad, \\"Heart\\". I like the album's theme, ballads plus eurodance. And those chit-chatting parts after the songs are so cute! Wish it went 14x platinum too. <br /> <br />1. Oops!...I Did It Again - See my review on \\"Greatest Hits My Prerogative\\". <br />2. Stronger - See Track 1. <br />3. Don't Go Knockin' On My Door - Not my favorite Britney song there is, but it's quite nice too. 8/10 <br />4. (I Can't Get No) Satisfaction - It sounds so nice! Why didn't they release it? It would've shot to the top of the charts! 10/10 <br />5. Don't Let Me be the Last To Know - It's so beautiful; why didn't it chart on the Hot 100? 10/10 <br />6. What U See (Is What U Get) - Sounds very Oops and Stronger-ish. I love it! 10/10 <br />7. Lucky - See Track 1. <br />8. One Kiss From You - Sounds better on \\"...Baby One More Time\\". 9/10 <br />9. Where are You Now - Another beautiful Britney ballad. 10/10 <br />10. Can't Make You Love Me - Sounds like a \\"sneak preview\\" to Britney's soon-to-be more different style of music (see Britney and In the Zone), and also bubblegum. 10/10 <br />11. When Your Eyes Say It - Also sounds better on \\"...Baby One More Time\\". 9/10 <br />12. Girl in the Mirror - My most favorite Britney song ever! It sounds so nice! Why wasn't it included in the original track listing, and why wasn't it a single? 10/10 <br />13. You Got It All - I hate the original version. This sounds much better. 10/10 <br />14. Heart - Sounds so much Dear Diary-ish! I still love it more, though. 10/10 <br />15. Dear Diary - Too short. Why wasn't it over four minutes? This song is Britney's songwriting debut. The lyrics are cute, though. 10/10 <br /> <br />Only two comments.  <br />1. Wish it was longer! <br />2. \\"Girl in the Mirror\\" should've been already on the original listing, and a single. <br /> <br />Thanks again, Britney! You rock!
B000AYQJJ2|5.0|THE LIMITED EDITION ISSUE IS PACKAGED AWESOME. LOTS OF COOL EXTRAS AND THE BOX RESEMBLES THE ORIGINAL RECORD BOX. DVD QUALITY IS OKAY - ALWAYS WAS SO-SO. LITTLE KIDDIE REVIEWER BELOW HAS NO CLUE WHAT GOOD MUSIC IS
B00005OM4N|5.0|Whereas \\"...Baby One More Time\\" and \\"Oops! I Did It Again\\" are bubblegum pop, the results of the teen-pop revival our dear pop princess started in the late 90's, this one is a real change. Britney is now an adult, and needs to leave the bubblegum pop behind, or she won't get very popular anymore. This is the result of the changes, but she's added sex in it. The titles say it all. She is \\"overprotected\\", loves \\"boys\\" and \\"rock & roll\\", is \\"not a girl, not yet a woman\\". I have an international edition with \\"When I Found You\\", \\"I Run Away\\" and \\"Before the Goodbye\\". I like the first two, the singles, and \\"Anticipating\\". I just don't get why none of them went even Top 10. However, Britney has given us something to smile about. In this more mature record, she shows us \\"what it's like to be her\\".
B0007Z4S4C|5.0|First let me say I'm a huge Led Zeppelin fan - I own all of the albums.  I don't really care for almost any of the Plant albums except for Walking into Clarksdale (with Jimmy Page).  Anyway this reminds me so much of the old Led Zeppelin albums.  Also the sound clips do not do it justice at all.  I was almost not going to buy based on the sounds clips.  I'm sure glad I got it - I'd give the album 6 stars if I could.
B000BKVQTS|3.0|Jake and Will Grimm are two cute con men, who stage hauntings in order to score some cash. Unfortunately, they get caught, and sentenced to death. They can get this death sentence waived however, if they go to the village of Marbaden where nine young girls have gone missing. Of course, it's better than dying, so they agree.<br /><br />Then begins the madness. They thought they would be up against fellow con men, but no. The forest is enchanted and they are way out of their depth (I'm NOT referring to their acting skills, either). Angelika, a villager who lost two sisters to the forest is pressed into helping them and the adventures begins.<br /><br />Okay, this is not going to win any academy awards. The character development could have been better, and why couldn't Heath Ledger get the girl? Why? But it's really not a bad movie.<br /><br />I have noticed that people are really complaining about the scene with the cat. It's a joke people. And honestly, when the same man who refused blood sausage ate it, it was kind of funny. Admit it. You snickered. I haven't heard any complaints about the general being stabbed with the flag pole, or Matt Damon being stabbed by Heath Ledger. Nope, it's just dear god, the humanity! They hurt a fake cat. What are you twelve? Grow up already. People got hurt in the movie too, hypocrite. And none of it was real. If you want to watch something real turn on the Discovery channel. Wait, some alligator just ate a deer! Agh! Agh! RUN TO THE SHELTER! No, seriously, just shut up.<br /><br />If you have a good sense of humor, you may like this. My only complaint was how each character seemed to be doing a different genre of movie. It went sort of like this.<br /><br />Matt Damon: Let's do a comedy! I will be a wise ass womanizer!<br /><br />Heath Ledger: No, I want to do a romance! I will be the tragic hero, unfit for the harsh realties of day to day living, hiding in fairy tales, and questing for magic beans, until the love of that special woman sets me free!<br /><br />Lena Headey: Let's do an adventure! I will play the exact same part as Kira Knightley in King Arthur! I will even talk like her!<br /><br />Monica Belluci: I want to do a horror movie! Oh, and show off my cleavage!<br /><br />Terry Gilliam: So many good ideas.  We'll do them all!  All I say!  In under two hours!<br /><br />And for some strange reason...it works.<br /><br />And now, if you should be so kind as to excuse me, I have a movie to go watch.

B000BVEKO0|5.0|Early this year, the metal community was shook with the startling news that Brian \\"Head\\" Welch, guitarist and one of the five founding members of the heavy metal band Korn, would be leaving the band to begin a spiritual journey with the purpose of finding Christ. The band proclaimed that they respected Welch's decision but would continue to make the music their fans had grown to love without him. Skeptics were quick to assert that it would be very difficult for a band originally with two guitarists to continue on with just one, but the four remaining band members implied that was exactly what would happen, as they stated they would not be seeking a replacement. <br />Last Tuesday, December 6th, the world was able to hear the first effort from Korn post Head's departure when See You On The Other Side, their seventh studio album excluding 2004's Greatest Hits: Volume One, was released to the general public. Overall, the disc has the same quality and feel that fans have come to expect from the band, with several minor differences that actually enhance the band's sound more than harm it. <br />The first single off the album, \\"Twisted Transistor,\\" leads the tracks with vocalist Jonathon Davis transferring thoughts through lyrics that speak of a lonely life that can't be fixed with screaming, and music, which reaches inside and preaches forever, serving as the answer. On this song and throughout the album, drummer David Silveria makes his presence known with his continuous and enthusiastic beatings, bassist Reginald \\"Fieldy\\" Arvizu strums out his dance-driven booms, and guitarist James \\"Munky\\" Shaffer jams through his riffs that add a certain flavor to the band's energized sound. Other tracks include the depressed and self-loathing antics of \\"Souvenir,\\" the sexual frustration anthem \\"10 or a 2 way,\\" the questioning and pleading of \\"Throw Me Away,\\" and the sympathetic death ballad \\"Love Song,\\" which actually goes into acapello at one point. <br />The artwork of the album holds a good amount of symbolism, as the cover depicts a dead boy holding a headless teddy bear. The limited edition of See You On The Other Side comes with a bonus disc that features three additional tracks, two remixes of \\"Twisted Transistor,\\" and two videos of Korn performing \\"Twisted Transistor\\" and \\"Hypocrites\\" live in Moscow. Plus, every copy of the limited edition includes a free one-year membership to the Korn BSC Online Fan Club, making the deluxe edition a better value and a must-have for any die-hard Korn fan. <br />The disc ends with a song entitled \\"Tearjerker,\\" which is probably the slowest song in the catalogue of Korn's discography. This final exertion leaves a hopeless feeling in the air, as Davis wishes for something more, feeling abducted and corrupted, and the band creates an eerie sound that continues to the end. Looking at the album as a whole, it has a definite ring of the band's past, but also accurately asserts their statement that just because they lost a guitarist doesn't mean it is the end for Korn. <br />
B000BW7QWW|5.0|I fell in love with the Firefly series from the very first episode. But the FOX network being the pathetic clowns they are went and canceled a series that had already been building up a huge fallowing. I was crushed when they canceled Firefly but not surprised. The FOX network's landscape is full of creations canceled due to lower then wanted ratings. FOX has this thing, they will cancel a show even if millions are watching, just because they find joy in crushing people's sand Castles. Sometime later when the series DVD came out. The shows popularity went up even higher then before! I was lucky enough to buy the set the day of it's release, while others had to find stores with a current supply of the DVD's. I remember the set moving up into the fifth all around rating on Amazon.<br />FOX, like others, now sees that rating are only a small part of the overall viewing audience. DVD's are literary Gold! Films like the very first (Blade) movie which did not do all that well in the threaters, made Gold on DVD sales.<br /><br />That being said, this movie is so much better then I was hoping it to be. I was hooked into the plot right from the opening scene. Seeing the FireFly transport ship called the Serenity flying towards a planet with the epic Modern/Western music playing in the background. It was like I found home again. I remember waiting for months and months for the show to hopefully come back. Then waiting more and more months for the DVD set. So seeing a full-pledged movie on the Firefly and her crew was so perfect for me.<br />Now I am not going to post a review telling you anything about the plot, because I always hated those people that went way too far into the plot before you have even had a chance to see the movie. All I will say, is I cried at the end of this movie.<br /><br />I hope so mega much that there will be sequels to this movie. I will watch them until I die,  that is how much I love this story. If you loved the show, you will feel right at home. If you are new to the whole story, then you will find your way to being a fan.<br /><br />Please buy as many DVD's as you can! So all of us fans will have more chapters in the story to look froward to.<br />The production studies make most of their profit on DVD sales, so it is never too late to support this series.<br /><br />Just give Serenity a chance. It is well worth your time and money.ole story, then you will find your way to being a fan.    Please buy as many DVD's as you can!

B00005JO9J|5.0|I'm a huge fan of medical dramas and originally I really didn't see how this show could differ itself from any other average medical show. I got hooked in the first five minutes and I've been watching ever since. Now that ER is sort of past its prime Grey's Anatomy can easy claim the title as the best medical drama on television.  <br /> <br />What really differs the show from any other medical show I've seen is the character development. The character development helped keep me interested and I felt I got to know Meredith and the other interns. I also got a feel for the hardships being an intern is and how much work goes into becoming a doctor. You also get a feeling of connection with the interns because of how much we find out about them. Dr. Shepherd, Dr. Bailey, and Dr. Burke help them along the way and offer some good advice. It's very informative and I've learned a few things watching it.  <br /> <br />Overall I think Grey's Anatomy is one of the best and most addictive shows on TV right now. This DVD is a great way to see it from the beginning and it's priced right and I highly recommend it. <br />
1594200106|4.0|Since there is a very long review about this book, I will only say that it is one that I recommend. I read this book in 5 days. I was taken in by it in the first 50-60 pages.  It ended up being better than I anticipated.  If you like a little mystery with a little bit of a love story, you will like this book. It is very good.<br /><br />Read it! You will not be disappointed.
6305313687|4.0|American History X is the story about Derek Vinyard (Edward Norton), a young, angry, white Neo Nazi who goes to prison for murdering two black men in cold blood.  When he returns home after three years, he is a humble, changed man, but still strong.  The only thing on his mind is to get his younger brother Danny (Edward Furlong of T2 fame), who idolized Derek, out of the influence of the skinhead gang run by the smooth and manipulative Cameron (Stacy Keach).<br /><br />We learn why Derek became the way he was.  We see the point of view of many frustrated people who could be led to the imagined camaderie and protection of a white supremacist gang.<br /><br />The movie made me weep.  It is a film that I wish all high school students could see, but there is a scene where Derek is violently sodomized in the prison shower, also the film opens on a sex scene.
0553573403|5.0|I wanted to get back to my youth and read a multi-book fantasy series, so I picked up the Wheel of Time.  It's hard to stifle the yawns just thinking about it.  Someone, don't remember who, recommended the Game of Thrones series and I'm so happy they did.<br /><br />--Some random thoughts--<br /><br /> 1)  Less magic - I am real tired of people using a mysterious force to bail themselves out of a jam.  How many times can you remember a main character getting out of a major jam and proclaiming, \\"I don't know how I did that!\\"  Doesn't happen here.  When a protagonist gets in a jam...well, you'll have to read the book.<br /><br /> 2)  Use of grey - Unlike other fantasy novels where everyone is either good or evil, in Martin's world everyone (just about) is somewhere in between.  The \\"evil\\" and the \\"good\\" are really only functions of perspective.  Martin does a great job with this.<br /><br /> 3)  Speaking of perspectives - I'm not a fan of novels that jump to another character's POV every chapter.  I still don't like it.  Just when I'm engrossed in what Jon is doing the chapter ends and next is 15 pages of Catelyn (my least favorite character).  This style does help with my previous point, but it's just not my cup of tea.<br /><br /> 4)  Social culture - To those people that call this book sick and disgusting...get OVER yourselves.  Yes, a young boy sees two people having sex.  OH NO!!  I bet that's never happened in the real world!  Yes, said boy is thrown from a roof.  WHAT?!?!  I bet adults have never mistreated/injured/killed children.  Yes, a young girl has sex.  FOR HEAVEN'S SAKE!!  I bet in the world today 12 year old girls aren't getting married.  PUHlease, do not judge the characters in a fantasy book by your social culture.<br /><br />My final thought - read this book, you'll be glad you did.
B000BW7QWW|1.0|I really wanted to like this film, but as I was watching it the movie became more and more unwatchable.  Here are things that I did not like about the film:  Spoilers!  1.  The dialog in this film was just terrible!  2.  Good guys just went back and forth from the same planets.  3.  Girl name River was annoying and walked around like a zombie.  Also, she sometimes went into some martial arts moves and killed off all the deformed looking bad guys.  4.  Ending was laughable!  I don't have much time to write this, so I hope that my review was helpful.
B000929AJQ|5.0|Nine Inch Nails is Trent Reznor, who has made a new style of music on his own.  If we had to classify it somehow, it'd be industrial-indie rock.  I give With Teeth 5 stars, for two reasons. <br />1) I would have gave it 4 and a half, but that wasn't an option for some reason. <br /> <br />2) This is the most accessible of the NIN albums.  It is a mainstream product, however, a very smart move by Reznor.  As one of the msot brilliant composers, he brings in fans of all genres.  \\"With Teeth\\" may seem to be the least industrial of the albums, however, it is well structured.  <br /> <br />\\"With Teeth\\" is the most melodic of his works.  He constructs an album that can play every song as a single hit.  Reznor's lyrics are not poetic, but pull in the same complexity of his other works. (Political, Existentialism, Emotions, and Drug Abuse) What is amazing about Reznor is his lyrics can be expressed differently.  One can perceive it as love, while the other can perceive it as political.  The piano work in \\"With Teeth\\" are masterpieces in itself, and the new basslines give this album a jump.  This album is a horrid disaster for industrial lovers, and veterans of NIN, but for the rock genre it is a magnificant hit.  \\"With Teeth\\" is the album of the year 2005 in my opinion.  It may perhaps catch the mainstream eye, however, it is unique and a brilliant artistic feat. <br />
0553801503|1.0|I had literally devoured the previous instalments of the series and like many others I was repeatedly teased by the ever shifting publication dates of this sequel. Eventually I simply gave up on checking and forgot all about Martin and his cycle. Then one day, upon entering the Amazon site, I saw that the Feast of Crows was actually in print. Wow. I ordered it immediately and went back to re-read book 2 and 3 to refresh my memory of the characters. I forgot how truly amazing those books were, such page-turners! The events of the Red Wedding, the stark scenes behind the Wall. Such powerful writing! Then I started off on the Feast of Crows and I noticed the sharp contrast, almost as if Robert Jordan had suddenly taken over the series. Minor characters spawning from every other page, meaningless wanderings, endless genealogies, a plot slowly and surely sinking in shifting sand. <br />What a huge let-down. Do yourselves a favor: read a short resume of this 1000 page indigestible blurb and wait for the next book.
B00008IAMD|5.0|It has been said that Johnny Cash could sing the phone book and make it sound compelling. His final recording is a testament to that statement. There is simply not a miss in this entire collection and the whole album sounds as if it is a mournful good-bye.  <br /> <br />Cash's rendition of \\"Bridge Over Troubled Water\\" stands next to Aretha Franklin's as the definitive version (although I'm still unsure of Fiona Apple's vocal background). <br /> <br />The real chiller is \\"First Time Ever I Saw Your Face\\". This IS the definitive version. One can see June Carter's face and feel the longing and love between these incredible artists. There is no doubt that Cash senses the end here and what an end it is. As blistering, raw and revealing as music gets. <br /> <br />Throw in the video/vocal for \\"Hurt\\" and you've got a peerless compilation from a man who knows too much, has given his all, and deserves every bit of respect and admiration this and all of his other work is garnering. Thanks Johnny. May you at last find peace.
0446577383|2.0|Baldacci has a great plot but the follow through is boring and not worth the effort: there is poor character development and too many strange and quirky characters. With a lot of editing and streamling it might make a good two hour movie for TV.
B0007OCG4W|1.0|How in the world this movie got nominated for Golden Globes and Academy Awards is beyond my understanding.  I gave it one star because there was no other choice.  It's a prime example of the trash that Hollywood ships out to an unsuspecting public.  The problem is that \\"big-name\\" stars are used to market smut and nudity and influence young adults into believing that hurting people, lying, being promiscuous and fearful of commitment is okay.  It isn't.  It's bad, really, really, bad.......and it's sad that some stars that I admired even agreed to star in it. Please don't waste your money and time on this film.  Instead, you might want to investigate some of the really good independent films which are out....\\"Dear Frankie\\",  for example, which recently was picked as #1 of the top ten movies of the year by the Associated Press Film Critic.  Spend your money on those and lobby for decent entertaining movies, and not necessarily the movies out of Hollywood.
B000B8QEYC|4.0|But then, this is Enya. She does what she does, she likes what she does, and, most importantly, she is quite excellent at what she does. That being, of course, the creation of some mightily exquisite aural tapestries with which a willing audience can envelope themselves like a warm, cushy conforter. In this regard, \\"Amarantine\\" lives up to promise, perhaps only deviating by way of the extent to which expectant Enya fans are invariably prone to measure any current effort against previous ones.    Although such comparisons are certainly within the arena of fair criticism, I would submit that even among those who have never heard of Enya, the evocative soundscapes contained within this disk are easily accessible. In fact, I would go so far as to say that if Enya had come out of the gate with \\"Amarantine\\", the very least that could be said is that this is a collection of some very beautiful music which is on par with the best of anything else that's moving \\"units\\" these days. To the uninitiated, I would only suggest taking in a few tracks on a decent sound system before deciding if this is your cup of tea -- which it either will be or it won't be.    As a post script, I have to express somewhat amusement at various comments I've read which attempt to dissect this album, seemingly note for note. Frankly, I find such efforts akin to reviewing some delightful chocolate confection by way of a precise chemical breakdown of its component ingredients along with the inherent nutritional value of each (or lack thereof, as the case may be). While such erudition can be easily admired and perhaps even welcome among more astute listeners, I would ask: Haven't you ever eaten a truffle?    Anyway, 4 Stars out of 5 (I'm one of those aforementioned \\"expectant Enya fans\\").

0385507755|3.0|I am an addict in recovery.  For every James Frey who can abstain from drugs and alcohol without a 12 step program, there are thousands of addicts who die, get locked up, or go insane while trying to \\"do it themselves\\". Otherwise, this is a very well written book that documents the pain and hopelessness of active addiction as well as any author ever has. <br />Another issue I take with the book, though, is it's accuracy and liberties with the truth. This is particularly apparant in his description of the dentist visit.  There is NO WAY a dentist would do a root canal without local anaesthesia.  There is no danger for a recovering addict to have their mouth numbed for dental work.  Knowing that this part of the book is untrue makes me doubt the accuracy of the rest of the book.  <br />'

B00006L7XQ|5.0|To call Johnny Cash country is like calling The Beatles country. Johnny Cash was just a man with his guitar. Although, sometimes he did proclaim himself a cowboy, and administered Western licks, but so do Pantera. Also, I call myself a pirate, but I ain't really one, I just wish I were a pirate. But that has nothing to do with this review... <br /> <br />Anyways, his renditions of others' songs are magnificant. He strips away genre, and adds layers of his own particular style. His own songs are equally exceptional. Each song can stand on their own, but also flow well together as an album. <br /> <br />Oddities would be \\"Danny Boy\\" and \\"Personal Jesus.\\" Although the latter is very stylish, for some reason seems a little over done. A pure acoustic version would have sufficed. <br /> <br />Cash's shakey, haunting, baritone voice makes him sound experienced and hurt, magnifying the meaning and emotion behind each word. It's not country. It's Johnny Cash, and he's reached his core. Just get it, and you'll see what I mean.

B000BW7QWW|5.0|First I have to say that I am a huge Joss Whedon fan going back to Buffy. When I saw Firefly I was blown away and considering my expectations going into it because it was from Joss that's a very high compliment. Then the show got cancelled, Browncoats all over the world were devastated. We loved this story and characters so much that we couldn't accept it ending, luckily for us and everyone else Joss felt the same. Then he gave us Serenity and I again was blown away and trust me that my expectations were even higher this time around. <br /> <br />This movie includes many genres and does it well. This movie was definitely worth the wait and I can only hope that we are lucky enough to get more of this wonderful story no matter what form it comes in. You don't need to be a fan of Firefly to get this movie but trust me that once you see Serenity you'll want more. Then I recommend getting Firefly box set. Our Big Damn Heroes will never let us down. Thanks Boss.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|If you're even reading this review, you're probably looking at reviews associated with my name, rather than reviews associated with the Firefly DVD series.  This is because there are already nearly 2000 reviews for Firefly, which has an average review rating of five stars.  I can't invent praise higher than that... but I feel it's worth a try. <br /> <br />The action is startling and well-choreographed.  The dialogue is funny, clever, and moving.  The characters are compelling and likeable, despite their all-too-human flaws.  The stories are imaginative and unpredictable, despite their frequent nods to the genre of classic westerns.  There is no aspect of this series that disappoints; every scene ranges from interesting to brilliant. <br /> <br />I am not a fan of the western, and most science fiction series have low expectations.  I didn't expect to like it.  Most of its first-time viewers didn't expect to like it, which is the most probable cause of its premature cancellation.  But Firefly can't be judged as a western, nor even as science fiction; it's just damn good television.  It is the most entertaining action series I have ever watched.

B00081U7HC|1.0|I hate this movie.  I hate how it romanticizes prostitution.  The average hooker walking the mean streets of america is a drug addict whose last resort to pay for her habit, is providing services to brutal, deviant scuzzballs.   It would be a wonderful world if even one these girls experience even a fifth of what the Julia Roberts characters experiences and the men they service bare some kind of a resemblance to the Richard Gere character.  This movie just outright glorifies  something that is so sad, just think about all those women out there who actually live this kind of life on a day to day basis, I bet it ain't so Pretty.
B000286RKW|5.0|Martin Scorsese's GOODFELLAS has a lift.  It's like RAGING BULL, except that it's not domineering.  It's like RAGING BULL made in a jolly, festive frame of mind.  In essence, it's about being a guy and guys getting off on being a guy.<br /><br />Scorsese, who knows how to make images dance, really keeps up the heat in this film and he doesn't go for ironic detachment.  He loves the Brooklyn gang mileu, because it's where distortion, hyperbole, and exuberance all commingle.  The movie is about being the cock of the walk, with banners flying and crowds cheering.  And this is what we get and feel for the film's first 90 minutes.<br /><br />Is it a great film?  Yes...it's one of the best of it's genre. Period.  It's a triumphant piece of filmmaking--jounalism presented with the brio of drama.  Every frame is active and vivid, and you can feel the director's passion and delight in making these pictures move.<br /><br />The moviemaking has such bravura that you respond as if your were at a live performance.  It's Scorsese's performanance.  He came of age as a director in the early 70's, at a time when many film enthusiasts were caught up in the 60's idea that a great film or even a good one is always about its director.  There's a lot of  metaphoric truth to this, but Scorsese puts the idea right up front.<br /><br />Scorsese makes you feel you'd like to hang out with him at a bar or coffee shop and listen to him tell how he brought off the effects; he's a master.
B000002J09|1.0|Now im not here to bash Led Zeppelin, but they're WAY overrated, They are great too. Jimi Page is the main purpose of the overratedness he is not the greatest guitar player. He is great, but not the best. John Paul Jones is underrated, but not great. Robert Plant I don't even think is a great singer, and John Bonham he on the otherhand is THE BEST DRUMMER of all time. these guys can write good songs and they are rockers, but not to the extent of what they have become.  <br /> <br />The songs that rock are Black dog and when the levee breaks, stairway to heaven is a great song once again though is overrated
B0002J4ZWS|5.0|The Shawshank Redemption came out in 1994 with very little fan fare.  It had it's share of rivals in Pulp Fiction and Forrest Gump, but I must say with complete humbleness, that this is one of the most underappreciated, underrated, and best films of the modern era of motion pictures.  I think the reason why the movie did little box office was the very odd title of the film and the fact that it is a film about prison.<br /><br />The story written by the horror master, Stephen King, shapes a unique and compelling story with many surprise twists including an ending that shocks and completely catches you off guard.  I read his short story on this movie in his novella, \\"Different Seasons\\" and King, a master at creating complex characters, reaches out and develops the two main protagonists extremely well.<br /><br />I can't see how a normal and sensible person cannot like this film.  It has everything: great story line, likable characters, a truly evil sinister antagonist, and surprise elements along the way.<br /><br />The movie is so well crafted that you feel you are eavesdropping on the main characters all the time.  For example, when Red finds Andy's treasure and personal note at the end of the film, Red opens up an envelope with a huge amount of cash and looks around as if someone is eavesdropping on him.  It's a poignant yet funny moment that takes the edge off of his discover.<br /><br />See this film.  If you give it a chance you may believe in the hope and triumph of the human spirit.

B000002ITG|4.0|LED ZEPPELIN-REMASTERS: The first and certainly most successful rock band to hammer old school blooze into molten metal, LED ZEPPELIN was forged by YARDBIRDS six stringer JIMMY PAGE as that group was disintegrating in the late sixties. Chronologically skimming the cream from every one of their classic LPs, the first half of REMASTERS is one of THE definitive histories of hard rock, from bombastic opener COMMUNICATION BREAKDOWN on through the last track, that eight minute FM radio juggernaut that need not even be mentioned here by name. In between you get the oily psychedelic drone of DAZED AND CONFUSED, stereo headphone freak-out WHOLE LOTTA LOVE, gargantuan crunch-fest IMMIGRANT SONG, and most of LED ZEPPELIN IV. The second portion represents the less interesting latter phase of their career, tho' the reggae-accentuated D'YER MAK'ER and hypnotic dirge KASHMIR are on a par with anything from the first four albums. LED ZEP's massive popularity, propelled by PAGE's arsenal of galvanized licks and ROBERT PLANT's soulful caterwauling, was mainly due to their epic albums, not singles...but at long last they gets a &#34;greatest hits&#34; treatment worthy of the legacy.<br /><br />RATING: FOUR STICKS
B0000CD8A7|5.0|Ride The Lightning (1984.), Metallica's second studio album<br /><br />The 1980's were undoubtedly the age of heavy metal. One of the genre defining bands of the decade was Metallica. Taking the heaviness of bands like Iron Maiden and combining it with intense speeds, Metallica were one of the bands to pioneer the genre we all know as thrash metal. The American band released their raw and aggressive first album, 'Kill E'm All' in 1983 however the band still needed a major record deal. Finally, they were noticed by Elektra Records and this album, 'Ride The Lightning' became their first major label release...<br /><br />... and what a major label debut it has proven to be! 'Ride The Lightning' is a masterpiece showcase of raw energy and intensity. The album is the best part of 50 minutes long and it doesn't hardly let up one bit. It's not hard to see why many Metallica fans hail this album as the band's best work. The album has raw qualities like its predecessor but at the same time, the song writing is awesome. The album is full of captivating guitar solos/melodies and grinding riffs that never for a moment loose interest plus at the same time, the music is played often at breakneck speeds! With all this, it is an album where with more and more listens, the work becomes more and more jaw dropping as you appreciate the phenominal and complex musicianship on the album. It is true to say there are some downsides to the album; James Hetfield hasn't quite found his vocal potential on the album although he gives plenty of aggressive and gruelling performances. Similarly Lars Ulrich's drumming does improve on the following two albums; it is sometimes low key in some areas on the album although he does pull off some stunning rhythms such as in 'Fight Fire With Fire'. These small pickings aside, Metallica work as a brilliant unit on this album. You can't fault the guitar play from Hammett and Hetfield and Cliff Burton's bass play is something else. The more you listen to this album, the more you can appreciate the blistering, resonating and sometimes cleverly distorted work from Burton's bass; it's truly awesome. 'Ride The Lightning' shows the Metallica of old; the band who were original and not interested in commerical success. The album is full of raw power and inspiration.<br /><br />'Fight Fire With Fire' gets this thrash metal classic going. Don't be fooled by the acoustic opening, the heaviness soon fades in. This opener is very aggressive and probably the rawest cut on the album. Snarling, complex guitar themes intertwine with a growling and angry vocal performance from James Hetfield and there is some great drumming from Lars Ulrich. The title track bursts in next. 'Ride The Lightning' is my personal favourite song on the album; a long but very spectacular song. Hetfield sings about a man condemned to death by the electric chair and his vocal style reflects this. The riff to the song is fearsome and the fast paced instrumental in the middle of the song is awesome; don't fail to listen to Cliff Burton's distorted bass in the background. One of Metallica's famous earlier songs, 'For Whom The Bell Tolls' follows. The lengthy cascading guitar opening is excellent and Hetfield gives a great vocal performance. Then, after all of these pacy, heavy tunes, 'Fade To Black' was a surprise for me, albeit a VERY good one. This lengthy metal ballad is the band's ode to suicide. Hetfield gives a more emotional vocal performance on this one. That's not to say the pounding riffs aren't there though and the song has a brilliant guitar exit.<br /><br />For the second half of the album, the intensity quickens up for 'Trapped Under Ice'. More snarling guitars, off beat pounding bass and a catchy chorus keep the high standard on the album going. 'Escape' is in a similar mold, with plenty of inspired guitar work. The album theme of death becomes even more plain with, you guessed it, 'Creeping Death'. If the hammering and dark opening chords don't entrance you into this song, then the lengthy vocal sequences with howls and thunderous guitar lines will. This is a masterful song. Then, to close the album, is the 9 minute instrumental, 'Call Of Ktulu'. This song, funnily enough co-written by Metallica exiled and later Megadeth guitarist Dave Mustaine, has a swirling, mysterious acoustic opening sequence. Eventhough it goes on just a little too long, the band give a powerful showcase on this song. Trademark pounding riffs are matched by great bass work from Cliff Burton; the song has some timeless melodies. The grand, crashing finish marks a classic end to a classic album.<br /><br />'Ride The Lightning' is a definitive metal album, and one of the greatest albums of the 80's as well as one of the band's best. This is a classic album from a genre defining band. In many ways it is quite sad to think how substandard this band's music has become over the past decade, no part due to the band going more commercial and shamelessly abandoning their thrash stylings (I'm looking at you, 'The Black Album'). However, the band's later failings aside, this album is amazing and is a must have!<br /><br />MY RATING: 9/10n the lengthy vocal sequences with howls and thunderous guitar lines will.

B00005JOHI|5.0|\\"Pride and Prejudice,\\" Joe Wright's adaptation of the Jane Austen classic, is peculiarly radient in that these sort of adaptations (for instance, the same novel's '95 television miniseries) are always done with an air of leisure, which is, unless handled well, simply another word for intense boredom; not to say director Wright cheapens the novel in any way. In fact, his luminosity only deepens what societal subtext there is, exciting and intriguing the senses with every frame. We can all from here on out exhale with relief at the thought of a period piece that does not meander but instead distills a piece of art to its exuberant soul while also providing an expansive emphasis on society, in this case Victorian-era Britain. Never are the bounds of marriage forgotten, or the lack of money, or the ridiculousness of romanticism in the context of Austen society (Charlotte, heroin Elizabeth Bennet's good friend, at some point says \\"I can't afford to be romantic\\" when defending her marriage to the sycophant Mr. Collins, a line that is all the more poignant coming from the fantastic Claudie Blakley).  <br /> <br />Perhaps what most distinguishes this version of the well-known tale of the Bennet sisters is the casting. I wholeheartedly call it perfect, with each daughter containg their aesthetic qualities and personality quirks as described in the novel. As with most British costume dramas, the supporting cast is pitch-perfect throughout, including Brenda Blethyn and Donald Sutherland as Mr. and Mrs. Bennet. Matthew McFayden plays Darcy convincingly, which is important considering the emotional arc he's called the portray. The biggest surprise, however, is most certainly Keira Knightly, who I expected to be nothing short of a mess but instead gives off the sharp, modest beauty inherent in Elizabeth Bennet.  <br /> <br />In my recent essay on the novel \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" for AP Literature, I concluded in saying that above all Austen makes the point \\"that all people deserveto love and deserve to be satisfied with who they are and who they grow to be.\\" Joe Wright's largest accomplishment is making me believe said message all over again. Even if the accomplishment is rather minor in terms of cinema (though major when considering that it's a debut), it compells on every level, a quality in film that's been missing for most of the year.

B000009HF2|4.0|Peter Frampton's FRAMPTON COMES ALIVE has been considered by rock fans, the great live album of all time.  What exactly makes that so?  What differentiates it from other live classics like say, Kiss ALIVE, Led-Zeppelin THE SONG REMAINS THE SAME, Grateful Dead DEAD AHEAD, Rush EXIT STAGE LEFT or Pink Floyd DELICATE SOUND OF THUNDER.  Is it perhaps that strange voice instrument he's using during \\"Do You Feel Like We Do\\". <br /> <br />I always figured a live album's popularity would depend more on one's personal music taste and perhaps if they had ever seen the band live before. <br /> <br />Don't get me wrong.  I absolutely love FRAMPTON COMES ALIVE!  I have it on CD, vinyl and cassette (perhaps someday on 8-track, too).  But I was only 9 years-old in 1976 so I can't personally relate to the man or the tour at the time. <br /> <br />I don't think I have any answers here.  I'm just putting the questions out there. <br /> <br />And by the way, to reviewer \\"Jeff J\\" who can be heard on FCA, I was at the Pink Floyd show at the Nassau Collisium in 1988 when they recorded DELICATE SOUND OF THUNDER.

B00003CXDG|4.0|Yes, it's true!  DIE HARD 2, TERMINATOR 2 and MISSION:IMPOSSIBLE 2 have all surpassed the originals, in my opinion.  Even when I was a kid, I thought SUPERMAN II outsoared the original for action. <br /> <br />When you sit down to watch an action film, you have to remember to judge if for what kind of an action film it is.  Immediately, you have to be prepared to suspend some disbelief and keep the possibilities open.  Is the plot even somewhat intelligent?  Is the acting any good?  Is the action in-your-face-relentless without being too stupid?  My answer for MISSION:IMPOSSIBLE 2 is an unequivelled \\"yes\\" to all of them. <br /> <br />The plot takes on a more James Bond-ish approach, with Tom Cruise's character, Ethan Hunt, out to stop a former MI agent from releasing a deadly virus on the population of Australia.  With him, is his \\"Bond girl-ish\\" sidekick and damsel in distress, Nia, played by Thandie Newton.  Combined with the hardcore action of director John Woo, you cannot help but enjoy this film.  The spectacular motorcycle sequence alone is worth your time. <br /> <br />The acting is as good as it can get for an action film.  Some lines stick out favorably like, \\"Well, Mr. Hunt, this isn't Mission Difficult.  This is Mission Impossible.  Difficult should be a walk in the park for you.\\" and \\"That punk put a hole in my Versache!\\" oh, and my personal favorite: <br />\\"She doesn't have the experience for a job like this.\\" <br />\\"What, to go to bed with a man and lie to him?  She's a woman, she has all the experience she needs.\\" <br />Sorry, ladies, I'm not sexist, but it IS funny. <br /> <br />Tom Crusie movies, for me, have always been a guilty pleasure.  And I must say, if the rumors are true, and he is gay, his action role of Ethan Hunt in I, II and the upcoming III does a terrific job of covering it up.  But then again, I suppose Rock Hudson did just as good a cover-up back in his day.

B000089CKH|5.0|\\"Less is more,\\" is a term that's not always accurate but if you were to defend it using this album as evidence, you would not fail. Blizzard of '77 captures the meaning perfectly, with one instrument under somber vocals. While the song is energetic it's also melacholic, with a softly flowing undercurrent of nostalgia, without having personal sentimental value, but is strongly sentimental anyway; \\"I miss you more than I knew.\\" All done with just vocals and one rhythm guitar.<br /><br />The other tracks which capture the same essence I would call, Inside of Love, Neither Heavan nor Space, and Paper Boats. Each one may be better songs than Blizzard, but are considerably less brilliantly simple. Still simple none the less, and have more to them, in a solid manner.<br /><br />The best of the upbeat tracks is Hi-Speed Soul, which I can't say much about because it's as straight forward as everything else but without the mysterious depth.<br /><br />Treading Water drifts from a the strange intro (with lyrics just as strange, \\"movies like zues\\") to float beautifully on the swiftly generated momentum created by itself, making the change seemless, while still obvious. Possibly the best Nada Surf has created, but not something I myself would rush to decide.<br /><br />La Pour Ca feels like lazy self motivation. Paper Boats is lustrous, gloomy, and mundane. Killians Red is a mastering of some of the failing sounds of \\"Proximity Effect.\\"<br /><br />The songs transist perfectly with each other without having connected transitions, like the album's a puzzle with each piece fitting snug, but each are their own without constructing one big picture.

B000BKJ78U|1.0|So I noticed this set at my local record store a few weeks ago, with the nice cover art, but shrugged my shoulders thinking it was just a new package for the 2004 DVD set. Several weeks later, I'm back, and I see the two side by side, and notice the price difference, so I decide to read the back and see what's different. Okay, there is obviously no 4th disc, um... what else... and then I read this: <br /> <br />\\"3-Disc Set includes all three classic movies digitally restored and remastered.\\" <br /> <br />HOLY CRAP! How did I not know about this?!? I'm skeptical for a moment, but this HAS to be the original versions. There is no implication on the packaging that it is the 1997 Special Editions, and it even says \\"classic.\\" I snatch it up, get in the car and race home, and prepare to finally view the films in the original theatrical, unmolested versions ... or so I thought. <br /> <br />I thought I would quickly hop on Amazon to see how much praise it had recieved, and see fellow fans drooling that their ultimate DVD fantasy has finally come true. Well, I find all these 1-star reviews and realize I've been duped by Lucas & Co. Thankfully I've kept it in the shrink wrap so I'll be returning this piece of garbage tomorrow. <br /> <br />Thanks for nothing, Lucas, you greedy fool. Your daft ploys have gone too far.
B000BVEKO0|5.0|I Have only one word for this cd is \\"EXCELLENT\\".
B00003CXCT|3.0|First of all, I just want to say that I have no plans to ever purchase the DVD set. I own Widescreen VHS tapes of the originals (the set released in 1995 before the Special Editions) and I'm quite pleased with them. However, for the sake of argument, I rented the DVDs from my local Blockbuster, just to see what George Lucas had done with each movie. What follows is (I hope) a fair assessment, as a fan of the ORIGINAL original trilogy. <br /> <br />The picture and sound are excellent, just what one would expect from a DVD Transfer. The Star Wars universe has always been a visually imaginative one, and deserves to be viewed with high quality picture and sound. The DVD Transfer does the movies extreme justice in that field. So the movies get an A+ there. As far as revisions are concerned, I can understand that George Lucas certainly has the right to make changes if he wants, but like any artist, I think he should have taken a step back first and asked if he was really making a change for the better. For example: <br />  <br />-I can't understand his logic for changing the sound that Obi-Wan makes to frighten away the Sand People in \\"Star Wars: A New Hope.\\" In the original, he sounded like a ferocious beast, something they might actually be scared of. I really can't describe the sound that he makes on the DVD, but I do know that it does not sound terrifying, and it doesn't seem logical to me that a group of Sand People would run from it (even if they are easily startled).  <br />-However, I can understand George Lucas's logic for having Temuera Morrison redo all of Boba Fett's dialogue in \\"The Empire Strikes Back\\" (given what we learned in \\"Attack of the Clones\\"), but honestly, I don't think the new voice fits the character that well. The original voice (that of Jason Wingreen) was better suited to Fett's personality of an emotionless, profit-driven hunter.  <br />-Likewise, I can see why he would put Hayden Christensen at the end of \\"Return of the Jedi,\\" but Christensen just doesn't seem to give off the outstanding look of fatherly pride that Sebastian Shaw was giving in the original.  <br />-Speaking of \\"Jedi,\\" my verdict on the ending is a toss-up, since I was never a huge fan of how the original ended (it was cute, but I felt it still left something to be desired. The highlight was the exchanged glances between Luke and the spirits of Obi-Wan, Yoda, and his father). I thought John Williams's music fit the galaxy-wide celebration of the Special Edition and sounded better than the original Ewok routine (and again, I can understand George Lucas inserting Naboo into that sequence on the DVD, and don't have a problem with that, since he's tooling around with something he put in back in 1997), but at the same time it didn't feel up to par with the music in the rest of the trilogy.  <br />-And I too feel that having Greedo fire first more or less screws up the character arc for Han Solo, an arc that was, in some ways, more satisfying than Luke's. In the first movie, we see a mercenary who doesn't care about anyone except for maybe his ship and Chewbacca, but has a change of heart at the end. Then we see someone who has his foot in the door, but it's mostly due to his feelings for the princess. Then finally, we finish with someone who has not only taken up a cause (with no thought of any sort of reward), but has matured to the point where (before he learns that Luke and Leia are related) he's willing to step out of the way if it will make his love happy. I never felt that Han needed to be a white-horse hero right from the get-go, but I think that what happens on the DVD (Han and Greedo shooting at the same time) is a fair compromise. It's not perfect, but I think Han still keeps his reputation for the first movie.  <br />-There is one scene in the Special Editions that I  particularly enjoyed, and that was a scene from \\"A New Hope\\" filmed back in 1977 (but never used in the original theatrical release) that better establishes the relationship between Luke and his childhood friend, Biggs Darklighter. As most character development scenes usually do, it wound up getting cut. But sadly, that was perhaps the only change that I truly enjoyed (until the day I die, I will say that the original band in \\"Return of the Jedi\\" sounded much better than the overblown production we saw in the Special Edition).  <br /> <br />When all is said and done, I give this set one star for the picture quality, another for the sound quality, and the third for the Bonus Disc (Lucas definitely delivered with that one, giving fans all the goodies that they've come to expect from movies on DVD). But as for the way that he keeps chopping up the classic trilogy, my father once used the following example in a conversation about Star Wars. He said that if you look at the Mona Lisa, she's completely out of style. Someone, if they were so inclined, should repaint her in more modern dress, and give her a more contemporary hairstyle (and maybe a navel ring or lip piercing). I won't deny that George Lucas has the right to alter these movies, but ultimately, it's up to individual Star Wars fans to determine if these changes make the movies that we grew up with more enjoyable. For me, the answer is no. But as I said, I have my VHS Box Set, so I'm not complaining. If, for you, the answer is yes, then by all means, I recommend the DVDs.
B000BVD460|5.0|Most artists, after releasing 4 or 5 albums, release their greatest hits CD. Few artists add original tracks. Eminem has done this. And the 3 bonus tracks are among his best tracks ever. When I'm gone is a poignant story about his life in stardom and reaches the emotional power of tracks like Stan, Mockingbird, and Hallie's Song. Now, Eminem haters will still not enjoy this album, but if you are an avid fan, or new to him, this album is a great place to start because it features some of his most incredible songs.
B000B5XOYI|4.0|Everybody seems to want to put down Batman Forever and Batman and Robin, but to be honest I never liked Michael Keaton that much anyway does anybody honestly think Micheal Keaton could kick anybodys ass. He was too old and too fat to be batman and the first two movies were so dark you could hardly tell what was going on. The Third and Fourth movies to me were more like a mixture between the first two and the 60's batman tv show. I'm a DC fan but I have to admit The spiderman movies were made just right and i wish they would make a Batman movie more like that. Dont get me wrong I had problems with all four of these batman movies, but they were still very entertaining none the less.
068485743X|1.0|Wow, here I am thinking about writing a book so I venture out to my local book store.  The cover \\"The First Five Pages\\" catches my eye.  I'm undeniably enticed and buy the book. What a waste; by the time I finished his book I doubted my own language.  I'm sure he makes his living discouraging future writers.  If you're looking for encouragement, I suggest you continue on your quest, preferably starting with Natalie Goldberg's \\"Writing Down the Bones\\".
B000286RNY|4.0|Shaolin Soccer makes for perfectly ridiculous fun when a team of down and out kung fu masters coalesce around a degraded legend turned coach to take the sport of Chinese soccer to new heights (literally).  For twenty years, Golden Leg Fung (Man Tat Ng) has limped around in the service of Team Evil Coach Hung (Yin Tse) waiting for his chance to be a coach, only to be ridiculed and driven away.  Then he meets a poor kung fu master out on the streets and, after seeing what incredible leg power the fellow has, comes up with the crazy idea of forming a soccer team of kung fu masters.  Mighty Steel Leg Sing (Stephen Chow), who had been looking for a way to spread kung fu teachings among more of the populace, quickly seeks out his former Shaolin brothers, none of whom are interested - at first.  Eventually, the new dream team is assembled.  There's Iron Shirt Tin, Iron Head, a very hefty Light Weight, Lightning Hands, and Hooking Leg (each of them named after his particular kung fu specialty).  They don't know the first thing about soccer, and Golden Leg has a time trying to coach them up in time to enter the big, upcoming soccer tournament.  Just when everything appears lost, the guys' kung fu powers are reawakened, and it's Game On from that point on.  They aren't exactly intimidating when they come out in their yellow bathrobes, each one of them less athletic-looking than the next, but it's immediately obvious that these guys, with their high-flying, ball-screeching skills, are a force to be reckoned with.  They are most definitely a sight to see.<br /><br />There's one more kung fu master in town, a shy young woman named Mui (Zhao Wei) who has no self-confidence and works making sticky buns (using kung fu, of course).  Might Steel Leg Sing befriends her, and there's a weird kind of romance between the two, but their weird relationship is sort of a weak spot in the story - although Mui herself is certainly a character of great importance.  The film is really just about absurdly unreal kung fu soccer moves on (and above) the field and their culmination in the championship game between Team Evil and our beloved Shaolin Soccer Team.  Hung, never above cheating, manages to put a team on the field that can actually outmatch the seemingly invincible kung fu soccer team, making it a contest unlike any you've ever seen before.  CGI effects aplenty accompany each and every move on the field, serious injuries abound, and the enthusiastic crowd loves every minute of it.  You'll see soccer play that even Pele could not have dreamed of (largely because it's all physically impossible) in this ultimate battle of good and evil.  There's never really much doubt about how things will end, but that doesn't take away from any of the zany super-soccer special effects that make this the most exciting soccer game in history.<br /><br />Shaolin Soccer is funny by design, and the key to making such a film is to go all out with the special effects.  That's exactly what Stephen Chow does in this hilarious blend of soccer, kung fu, and comedy.  Even when it takes on a distinctly cartoonish air, Shaolin Soccer proves more entertaining by the moment.  With its constant humor and spectacular special effects, the film all but guarantees that a good time will be had by all.t absurdly unreal kung fu soccer moves on (and above) the field and their culmination in the championship game between Team Evil and our beloved Shaolin Soccer Team.

B0002SROSQ|5.0|I'm a new Nick Cave fan.  I don't know how he's escaped me so long.  I started out with _Boatman's Call_ and couldn't quit listening to it, especially the song _People Ain't No Good_ and _There Is A Kingdom_.  His voice and his words equally resonate.  The songs themselves read like Donne or Dylan Thomas and speak to a sort of belief that rocks and threatens even as it soothes.  I had my doubts that this album could equal Boatman's Call in my estimation--but it equals and surpasses, in many aspects.  So many of these songs gave me chills, either of pleasure or fear.  C.S. Lewis once said \\"The business of Heaven is Joy\\".  There's joy in these songs--joy and terror, and longing, and loneliness.  Add to that a solid, tooth-rattling rock sense and lyrics that bite like cold iron, and you have a work of stunning beauty.
B000AU9UYM|5.0|I have very little to say about this movie: <br /> <br />1. It is the best of the live action Batman movies. It captures what made the comic books so good unlike the Burton/Schumacher era or as I call them: Burmachers. It falls short of the Bruce Timm produced Animated Series. <br /> <br />2. Christian Bale is a great Bruce Wayne and a good Batman! Before Bale the best of the Batmen was Adam West and considering he played Batman for camp that ain't a good thing. <br /> <br />3. It isn't just a good superhero movie it's a great movie! It's in Superman: The Movie territory and not Spider-Man/Electra/Superman IV: The Quest for peace territory. This flick should get an Oscar! It's that damn good! <br /> <br />In short buy this movie! It is the cinematic definition of shock and awe! Much like the Batman himself!
B000ASATWQ|4.0|Excellent album, I didn't know what to expect when I borrowed the album from my 14 years old stepson. I listened to a lot of Bob and alike and was happily surprised. It reminded me, on certain tracks, two albums I own, Wyclef Jean presents the Carnival and Tricky Blowback. Well produced, recommended with headphones...
0440241588|1.0|Why did John Grisham think he can write about his holiday in Italy and his Italian lessons and somehow fool us into thinking this is a political thriller? Does he really think we're that stupid? <br /> <br />If you want to read monotonous page after page of \\"The Italian for car is macchino\\" and \\"This Italian castle was built in 1428...\\" then by all means buy this book. But if you are expecting some thrills and anything more than a basic plot, don't waste your money. <br /> <br />I, for one, shall be returning this book to the bookstore. What a waste of time and money. The arrogance of Grisham! No book has ever made me angry like this before. Shameful!
0316779237|5.0|David Sedaris gives holiday reading a whole interesting twist in this short-story collection.  Holiday on Ice features six stories that vary from being darkly funny to surrealistically twisted.  Christmas is shown in a whole different and satirical perspective in these short stories.  I couldn't put them down and laughed myself numb with the hilarious passages and dialogue. I wished there had been more stories in this collection.  My favorites are \\"Dinah, the Christmas Whore\\" (this story is somewhat autobiographical), \\"Season's Greetings to Our Friends and Family!!!,\\" and \\"SantaLand Diaries.\\" All six of the stories, three of which had been previously published, though I hadn't read any of them before, are incredible, but the aforementioned three are the ones that stand out the most to me.  I loved Me Talk Pretty One Day and am glad I gave another Sedaris book a whirl.  His style is quite similar to the works of Augusten Burroughs.  They both write dark, satirical and surrealistic fiction.  Are you in the bargain for cynical holiday stories?  I cannot recommend Holiday on Ice enough!  This is a not-to-be-missed holiday read.
1592400876|3.0|Lynne Truss has created a book that provides entertaining reading to an audience of persons who find the rules of punctuation and the oddities therein fascinating. Therein lie the strengths and the weaknesses of the book. For persons who have an interest in the topic, the book, to steal a line from the musical Mary Poppins, helps the medicine go down in a most delightful way. A person reading the book can read the rules of punctuation and actually be entertained rather than bored stiff, and there is much to praise in that. <br /> <br />That having been said, now comes the down side, which must be addressed none the less. Many people are blissfully ignorant of the rules of punctuation and couldn't care less, and this book will not enrich their lives very much. For those persons who are lukewarm on the topic, this book is not likely to convert a lot of these persons as it lacks an index, an absolute necessity to be useful as a reference, which is most likely how the newly enlightened will want to see the book. In truth, I thought that while it is indeed wonderful to see so many of the rules nicely spelled out in the book, the fact that there is no easy and quick way to access them without thumbing through the entire book to hunt for them is a major drawback for any person who really wants to use this book as a resource for instructing others. <br /> <br />This book came recommended to me by someone who suggested it as a means of getting a refresher course in punctuation as it is commonly taught today as opposed to the way it was taught in the Sixties. I did learn a few minor differences from the book, and for that, I am grateful. However, that still doesn't excuse Lynne Truss for making a mistake in the title of her book! A stickler should be consistent throughout!

B000AGTPUU|5.0|When I saw the movie in the theater, I thought that it was animated, though as I understand it; this movie was not animation, but was made to look as if it were. Granted, some of the scenes had to be simulated, I'm sure. And by the way, as the young kid's review said, nobody was eaten by a wolf, and nobody was thrown off the train.<br /><br />It was a kick in the head the day I found out there was no such thing as Santa Claus (I was sixteen.) But this movie allowed me to pretend for about an hour and a half, that there was a Santa Claus. Those who gave this movie a bad review are certainly entitled to their opinion, but their negative reviews won't stop me from liking this film. Nowadays, it seems like tons of rubbish is put out (Saw, House Of 1,000 Corpses, The Devil's Rejects.) I have seen none of the movies I just named, but given the names, and in the case of the second and third movies; the director being Rob Zombie, I already knew I didn't need to waste my time or my money. On the other hand, Polar Express was a terrific movie, and the soundtrack is nice too. HIGHLY recommended!
B000BJS4TO|5.0|I have read tons of reviews that said that the movie does not portrait real old Kyoto.  Neither the music, some people commented. That may be true but as someone of the who was born and brought up in Kyoto, I agree with Ken Watanabe's comment during the interview in which he said rather than being picky about how realistic it is, enjoy the fantasy of old Kyoto.  I do have to admit that the movie may not show the real Kyoto - but what is real Kyoto? You cannot find this in modern Kyoto any more in any case, beside some remains from the past.  The following review of this soundtrack is based on my understanding of this movie as a tale in the fantasy world.  So I would not comment anything on how the music is close to Japanese music etc.<br /><br />The music from this movie has one clear metaphor, \\"life is a river.\\" Once I felt this, all the music started speaking to me.<br /><br />1) Sayuri's Theme: Very calm yet strong music which portraits Sayuri's hidden passion for Chairman and to become a geisha in order to meet Chairman.  This music beautifully shows Sayuri's personality which is not very expressive but deep and thoughtful as in the original book.<br /><br /> 2) The Journey to the Hanamachi: This music illustrates Chiyo's and Satsu's anxiety of going to Kyoto, which was mysterious place for them.  As the music continues, it shows the some elegance in Kyoto with the smooth sound of cello, against the deep sound which still shows their fear and anxiety.<br /><br />3) Going to School: This music instantly makes me recall of Chiyo and Pumpkin running to school for the very first time.  Compare to the deep sound in \\"The Journey to Hanamachi,\\" the sound is light and cheerful which reminds me of the river in Kyoto in spring.  Also the repetition of a certain melody makes me think of the practice at school.<br /><br />4) Brush on Silk: This music shows a challenge that Chiyo was facing.  Also this sound somewhat reminds me of a Japanese classic dance which requires the most skill and technique.<br /><br />5) Chiyo's Prayer: It starts with the sound similar to the large bell in a temple or in a shrine, then it continues to the smooth cello and koto sound which represents geisha (at least to me).  After the twinkling sound, it goes back to the deep cello sound portraying the very deep determination Chiyo made at that time.  Beautiful, strong, and deep.<br /><br />6) Becoming a Geisha: Very elegant piece with luxurious sound.  I was literally taken into the world of transformation Chiyo/Sayuri went through.  Suddenly in the middle of this music, it changes into a very rhythmical and speedy sound followed by cello playing the main theme.  After this part, you do not see any piece of sad Chiyo at all.<br /><br />7) Finding Satsu: Very fearful, anxious music.<br /><br />8) Chairman's Waltz: This \\"not going anywhere\\" music is very sad, showing a very discreet passion of chiyo.<br /><br />10) The Garden Meeting: The replay of melody from Chairman's Waltz portrays the hidden sadness Sayuri had.  Then it plays the smooth flowing cello sound - which is like a flow in the river you cannot swim against.<br /><br />11) Dr. Crab's Prize: This music is played when Sayuri goes through her mizuage.  It is so much like \\"tea ceremony\\" in a sense, which she had to go through all the steps to come to this stage.  As the music continues, the sound becomes stronger slightly showing the power or authority which Sayuri cannot go against.<br /><br />12) Destinty's Path: This is exactly like a river.  It starts from the small vibrating sound that reminds you of a chatter of the brook, then goes to a wider river.  The sound becomes loud and small as if all the events in our lives.  However the water moves within that river, they cannot go against the flow.  This, to me, is like a destiny and the idea we have for the life is well represented.<br /><br />13) A New Name... A New Life: This is very mysterious and elegant piece.  It starts with the tinkling soundand the smooth cello.  The music makes me feel wonder what would happen next, what would happen next, without giving me a clear answer to it.  But in the middle, it starts revealing the path to the answer with some elegance.<br /><br />14) The Fire Scene and the Coming of War: This is very different from the rest of the music.  It really sounded like a \\"movie music\\" until it plays nagauta, the Japanese classic singing, saying \\"clam down this wave...\\"(I could not understand the whole lyrics.) Toward the ending, the music becomes dramatic, showing that something is coming.  The war. There is no elegance or graceful sound played in other pieces and it tells us that the situation is now completely changed.<br /><br />15) As the water...: This is very calm, sad, as if the one is killing onself in his/her mind, trying to forget everything.<br /><br />16) Confluence: This piece is very beautiful, showing a dramatic \\"confluence\\" of people's lives.<br /><br />17) A Dream Discarded: Very calm and sad piece which illustrates Sayuri's feeing like a wave - but very calm.  You can picture her, recalling all the dramatic events occurred in her life but standing very calmly.<br /><br />18) Sayuri's Theme and End Credits: The music comprises all the above elements into one piece.  The starting point, transformation to geisha, dramatic emotional events happened in her life, sadness for not being able to go against the flow despite her passion etc.<br /><br />Overall, the music is clearly interpretable, and the cello was beautiful.  Most pieces have the some inspiration from the Japanese music and Asian music, which add the exotic hint in the whole music, in addition to the effect as the general sound track.

Sadly I was mistaken.  <br />The simple fact is Joss Whedon sold out for money, just like so many do these days. He ruined everything that was good about the firefly series. Shame on you Joss...
B00005JOFO|3.0|The only thing great w/ this movie is the cinematography. Nothing else. This movie is more of an indie drama but nothing really happens in the movie. Anne Hathaway was so terrible when she aged in the 20 year span of the movie. She still looked like 20 yrs old other than her hair change in every different scene. The movie wasn't an epic tearjerker. There wasn't an emotional rollercoaster present in the movie. Everything was very tame and subdued. It seems every reviewer on amazon is giving it 5 stars cuz their either gay and support such a movie or a gay hater who rates it a 1 or zero if given the option. I came across a reviewer at Netflix who said \\"I have lost all respect for these male actors cuz boy on boy action is not cool\\". Hello it's just acting. Of course i saw the reviewer's residence and he's from some redneck town called Indianville. There's other great indie gay theme movies out there
B00003CX5P|5.0|I'm a part of the Star Wars Generation of the 70's and 80's! Heck the first movie I saw was Star Wars - Episode IV: A New Hope back in the summer of 77. It's been a part of my entire existence and I thank God for George Lucas. <br /> <br />The long wait between 1983 and 1999 was indeed a long one. Sure there were novels and comic books in the meantime but they weren't Star Wars. Not really. But Episode I was certainly worth the wait! <br /> <br />Most people would assume with Episode I that Lucas wouldv'e started small and then built things up throughout his trilogy but instead he started BIG with a capitol B and he ended EPIC with his Episode III.  <br /> <br />Episode I was smart, fun and fast paced. Sure the more nuerotic moviegoers let a silly character like Jar Jar ruin their experience but the more hardcore fans saw and appreciated what Lucas was doing-starting the series light and then growing darker as it progresses. It paid off big time! <br /> <br />In the end we got a movie that was worthy of the reputation of the Original Trilogy and we got a new trilogy that bettered what came before it! <br /> <br />The Phantom Menace rocks! The Prequel Trilogy rules and George Lucas has cemented himself as the finest visual storyteller of all time. <br /> <br />Buy this movie! It does NOT disapoint!
B0000633T6|4.0|Director Tony Scott should take the main bow for SPY GAME, an intellectual spy flick and primarily a director's film. With locations shot in Beirut, Lebanon, Berlin, Budapest, Casablanca, England,  Haifa, Hong Kong, and Prague, a certain color and realism is guaranteed. And, sure enough, the photography and direction are in capable hands as is the script, which seems flawless. You gals out there might note that BOTH Robert Redford and Brad Pitt star in this slick tale of the CIA spy game. (Yummy!) Some reviewers seem concerned about an emotional flatness between Pitt and Redford but, hey, these guys are trained killers or at least serious craftsmen in the field. You feel too much as a CIA agent, you forfeit your life, my friend. So let's get real, okay? And very real is SPY GAME. The plot is intricate and layered as a wedding cake. CIA veteran Nathan Muir (Redford) is retiring and on his last day at his CIA job (what a waste of talent!) and his impulsive younger protege Tom Bishop (Pitt) is being held in a Chinese prison about to be executed for a botched rogue operation. How Muir saves the day for Bishop from long distance, being watched and questioned by his superiors in Washington who would rather see Bishop be executed by the Chicoms, is the crux of the story. It is a kind of mind over matter thing, the cleverness of Muir's efforts in contrast with the physicality of Bisphop's failed operation. Scenes of Bierut street fighting, flashbacks to Vietnam, takes inside CIA offices, all are very well done. SPY GAME is a classy, entertaining spy flick with good production values. Again, hats off to the director.
B00006CXSS|5.0|This collection is by far the greatest mini-series ever made on WWII. It has excellent story lines and it has very deep and compelling characters. What sets this apart from many other war movies is that it is based on true events and actual people. It draws its concept from Stephen Ambrose's book \\"Band of Brothers\\". The series was a project of Tom Hanks and Steven Speilberg, and they definitely out did themselves. It is truely a series not to miss, and I can assure you that you will enjoy it and treasure it. It is a 10 part series and the collection includes a must have bonus disc. The men of Easy company are true heroes!

B000AGTPUA|1.0|I went to see this last winter with some friends from college. I saw that Tom Hanks had a hand in making this flick. Normally I have been very pleased with his work, but this movie downright disappointed me! It had great special effects, but very little to do with the actual story.<br /><br />Every Christmas Eve, my mom reads the book to my sisters and me, and it seems the magic is still there. But this movie wasn't magical at all.
B000002G87|5.0|I remember going into one of my favourite record stores way back when they used to hand out the radio stations \\"Top 40\\" record charts. Glancing at it I saw a new entry by a group called \\"Derek and the Dominos\\". It made me think of the many groups from the 50's and 60's with names like \\"Blank and the Blanks\\". Like most people , the first time that I heard the opening riffs on \\"Layla\\" I was instantly hooked. It took a few more years to figure out most of the words and their actual meaning. And the rest as they say is history. There are other decent tunes on the album, my favourite being \\"Bell Bottom Blues\\" but all (unfortunately) fade in comparison with the title cut. Not bad for three guys named Jim Gordon, Bobby Whitlock, and Carl Radle who originally were with Delaney & Bonnie and Friends. They were brought on board by Delaney Bramlett. Eric Clapton even played with Friends for a short while. Its too bad that this was another one of a Clapton connected project that ended even before it had begun.We've had a Cream reunion that nobody thought would ever happen. Here's hoping. And oh, thank you Delaney. Some trivia for you. Recently I was at a shop and was going through boxes of old 45's. I found a copy of \\"Layla\\" from 1977 on Epic by the \\"Valverde Brothers\\". It was a cross between the \\"Chipmunks\\" doing disco and those infamous one drum beat of the \\"Stars On\\" albums. I never knew of anyone else covering \\"Layla\\" and I still wish I hadn't. Just terrible.

B00005JO17|4.0|Seeing how dependent the Walt Disney Company is on its experimental computer animated project Chicken Little to succeed at the domestic box office in order to retain any lasting hope of gaining some bit of leverage over their former collaborator, Pixar Animation Studios, you look back on the legacy former-Chairman/CEO Michael Eisner left behind and realize how much he truly screwed up. His ill-founded stubbornness plagued many areas of the corporation giant, but no more evident then in the hollowed animation branch of the company, the one on which the company was essentially founded upon and from which much of the corporation's success had been generated up until now. Eisner's rather unwholesome relationship with Jeffrey Katzenberg (currently the president of the animation division of Dreamworks SKG), mismanagement and piss poor selection of the releases of the motion picture unit's live-action division, and the company's precarious dependency on the success of Pixar's projects for revenue all contributed to the state Disney finds itself in now. However, with Michael Eisner, Job's main contention for stalling negotiations between the two entertainment giants, gone, though certainly far from forgotten, a `peace deal' can hopefully be reached. Nonetheless, it may end up costing Disney a bit more then had Eisner not screwed thing up in the first place, particularly if Chicken Little is not quite the hit it wants it so desperately to be. <br /> <br />The story for Chicken Little is surprisingly original, truly a credit to Walt Disney Pictures and the film's creators, with a balancing of heart-warming and emotionally inviting family values with analytic humor for each member of the family. It is not nearly as amusing as The Emperor's New Groove, a previous animated feature from the creators of Chicken Little released several years ago, but its own unique brand of off color humor makes it memorable nonetheless. There are quite a number of classic film references, subtly done of course, including allusions to scenes from King Kong, Saturday Night Fever, Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back, Alien, and, best of all, a purely delightful take on the memorable scene from Raiders of the Lost Ark. Also, present throughout the film are additional references to the antics of the animal world. These astute jests include a bull running a china shop, birds ramming into store windows, dogs ordering up a bowl of water or kibble at a restaurant, fish driving fishbowl cars, etc. <br /> <br />Zach Braff, best known for his work on the NBC television comedy Scrubs and Garden State, his independent directorial debut, does an impressive job as the antagonist of the story, Chicken Little. Braff should be praised alone for actually giving Chicken Little a distinctly different voice rather then simply applying his own to the character as so many actors have done in the past. There clearly an emotional depth to the character, based on Braff's voice over performance, that really makes you root for the little guy. Gary Marshall who has been known mainly for his work behind the camera for such films as Pretty Woman, Runaway Bride, and the Princess Diaries series provides powerful emotion content to the role of Buck Cluck, Chicken Little's single father who is still reeling from the embarrassment of the \\"sky is falling\\" incident less then a year earlier. The scene near the end of the film in which he admits to his emotionally exasperated son that he hasn't been the best father to him having dismissed his claim that the sky was falling, which now proved to be true, and for projecting the idea onto him that he had to earn his father's love, respect, and admiration. The scenario may seem a bit corny and it does greatly reduce the action and the pace of the film at this point but the voice talents of Marshall and Braff make it work effectively. Runt of the Litter, voiced by Steve Zahn, and Fish Out of Water, voiced by Dan Molina, editor of Chicken Littlewho performed the character by vocalizing through a tube into a water cooler tank full of water, act as comedic relief for the film and their scenes are the absolute highlight of the movie. Chicken Little himself and the rest of the cast are decent in their own right but these two will likely be the most memorable characters to emerge from this picture. And, as a bit of an added bonus for Chicken Little, the film boasts an impressive array of comedic voice talent including Patrick Stewart as Professor Woolensworth, Patrick Warburton an alien police officer, Fred Willard, Catherine O'Hara, Adam West, and acting veteran Don Knotts as the comically indecisive mayor of Oakley Oaks, Turkey Lurkey, who is given direction via cue cards created by his secret service entourage. <br /> <br />Overall, Chicken Little, though arguably not Disney's best work to date and no where quite near the magnificence of what Pixar Animation Studios has released, is cute and a bit gratifying its own unique way and marks a brilliant departure for Walt Disney Feature Animation from the now defunct days of traditional animation and into the fascinating new genre of computer generated animation. It is not perfect by any stretch of the imagination to be certain but it is, however, a start and that is what truly matters most for Disney at this point. With Michael Eisner gone and a new CEO is calling the shots from on high, though many still suspect him to be nothing more then an Eisner crony, Walt Disney Feature Animation can hopefully pull itself out of the gutter it has been lying motionless in for years now, Brother Bear and Home on the Range being recent examples of this, dust itself off, and begin anew. The film boasts an eloquent musical score by John Debney, albeit one that is certainly not a memorable as it should have been coming from Walt Disney Feature Animation. It's selection of songs which appear on the film's soundtrack also hit quite a few notes with audiences. The best song on the list has to be Bare Naked Ladies' \\"One Little Slip\\" which, when see in conjunction with the film on the screen, should be nominated for Best Song at this year's Academy Awards ceremony. Five For Fighting's \\"All I Know\\" and R.E.M.'s \\"It's the End of the World As We Know It\\" are other notable highlights. Sadly other songs on the soundtrack, specifically Diana Ross' \\"Ain't No Mountain High Enough\\" and the Spice Girls' \\"Wannabe\\", feel as though the story was built around their inclusion rather then the story being written and having them slipped in. They are not badly place mind you; it just feels as though they are a bit forced. Chicken Little is Walt Disney Feature Animation's first full departure (Dinosaur was not produced by WDFA and was only partially computer generated, the backgrounds were live-action templates) and though it is not quite the holiday blockbuster many were expecting, it is a significant stepping stone from future CGI-animated project like Meet the Robinsons and American Dog, from the creators of Lilo & Stitch, are sure to pick up from.
B0000DD7LC|5.0|Alicia Keys is a true modern day Soul singer!  I love her!  Her music is the truth and she can sing her butt off!  She writes  as well as performs her music - a true artist.  I loved her from the beginning but this album is far better than her first (which is a hard one to beat). Every song is great!  It's hard for me to pick a favorite, but if I had to break it down, my favorites would be \\"You Don't Know My Name,\\" \\"If I Ain't Got You,\\" \\"Karma\\" and \\"Diary\\" (all of her singles) but every song is great!  The only song on the cd that I'm kind of not feeling (although still a good song) is \\"Heartburn,\\" the beat is tight and all, but not Alicia Keys style.
B00063EMJ6|5.0|There as for as long as I can remember three distinctive groups of music. There was the heavier innovative British sound, the more commercial but good American sound and the unique Canadian sound. When I read from your Amazon reviewer that Neil Young only cracked the top ten once, that is a true statement. Or when one of your other reviewers states that \\"there aren't a lot of famous Canadian rock stars\\" that as far as he knows is also true. Only one problem. There are untold numbers of Canadian rock stars...in Canada that cracked the top ten over and over. One trouble was that most of them or their singles couldn't crack the lucrative American market. Neil Young had hits in Canada with almost all of the tunes on this compilation, most notably \\"Cinnamon Girl\\" and \\"Like a Hurricane\\" with his sometimes group Crazy Horse, \\"Only Love Can Break Your Heart, Old Man, Southern Man (rebuttal by Lynyrd Skynyrd on Sweet Home Alabama) Harvest Moon, Hey Hey My My\\" etc. etc. etc. And lets not forget the song that Neil, Dan Akroyd, Tom Green , Gordon Lightfoot and company closed out \\"Live 8 \\" in 2005, the mega hit \\"Rockin' in the Free World\\". There are a lot of good Canadian artists overlooked outside of Canada. Start with 70's icons Triumph, Trooper, Prism, April Wine, Aldo Nova  to start. I think that you'll be pleasantly surprised.
B00080ZG10|4.0|Martin Scorsese's The Aviator is a long way from Raging Bull, Goodfellas and Taxi Driver, the films that Scorsese is best known for. However, The Aviator demonstrates his incomparable filmmaking talent just as well as those classics even if it doesn't deliver the same gut-punch. The Aviator tells the story of Howard Hughes -  billionaire, aviation fanatic, movie producer, womanizer, obsessive-compulsive. The movie follows two decades or so of Hughes' life beginning with his attempts to film his war epic Hell's Angels to his battle with a slimy US senator in the late '40s. <br /> <br />Hughes is played by Leonardo DiCaprio in an unusual bit of casting. In actuality, DiCaprio was one of the key forces trying to get the movie made after being interested in Hughes' story for several years. DiCaprio offered it to Scorsese to direct and thankfully he accepted. DiCaprio also starred in Scorsese's Gangs of New York. Though I loved the movie, I wasn't too impressed with DiCaprio. I felt that he didn't have much to do in that film, however that could be because my attention was always on Daniel Day-Lewis. However, the same cannot be said of The Aviator. DiCaprio's performance is incredible. He truly shows his potential as an actor with this movie. No more cute little puppy-dog-eyed teenager roles. He has become an actor of true range and depth. His performance as Howard Hughes is a wonder. He truly deserved his Best Actor Oscar nomination. Of course, Cate Blanchett got a well-deserved Oscar for her memorable portrayal of Katharine Hepburn. Kate Beckinsale is also very good as Ava Gardner. There are numerous other great actors who are eminently watchable in this film: Alec Baldwin, Alan Alda, John C. Reilly, Ian Holm, Danny Huston, Jude Law (briefly as Errol Flynn).  <br /> <br />Also deserving mention is the great Dante Ferretti whose production design won a well-deserved Oscar. Ferretti truly brings the 1930s and '40s to life in remarkable detail. The material isn't quite what Scorsese is usually interested in, however there are certainly many elements that I can imagine were appealing to him. I know that he must have loved depicting 1930s Hollywood on film. Recreating the premiere of Hell's Angels with Howard Hughes accompanied by Jean Harlow. I'm sure he loved using '30s and '40s jazz throughout the movie as well. Scorsese crams a lot of detail into the movie, particularly the scenes dealing with Hollywood. If you've seen Scorsese movies before you know that he has an incredible flair for visual storytelling and The Aviator is chock-full of his visual genius. The flying sequences are particularly well done, featuring the most computer generated effects that Scorsese has ever used. However, the effects do not draw attention to themselves. You will probably not even realize that they are special effects. <br /> <br />Some critics have said that The Aviator looks great, but is emotionally hollow. All style and no substance. I disagree, I think the drama is exactly what it needs to be. The movie is about Howard Hughes, his successes and his failures. Hughes' conflict is both internal and external. There are Juan Trippe and Ralph Owen Brewster battling against him and there are his own personal flaws. He is ambitious, often overly so, yet he could not control his inner demons. His battle with obsessive compulsive disorder nearly gets the better of him, but he emerges victorious thanks partly to his determination and partly to his intelligence.  <br /> <br />I recommend The Aviator if only for the wondrous direction, cinematography, and production design and for the great performances by Leonardo DiCaprio and Cate Blanchett. There is a personal story here that will connect with some people and won't connect with others, yet there is much to enjoy and admire about this fabulous period drama.
B000001EG6|5.0|Though \\"Empty Sky\\" had already been released in the UK, \\"Elton John\\" was the artist's debut in the U.S. And a better-constructed debut is hard to imagine. John and lyricist Bernie Taupin fleshed out their ballads and country-blues with lush string orchestrations (courtesy of Paul Buckmaster), gospel choirs and great rock 'n' roll guitars and drums. Taupin wrote lyrics whose words were indelible, even when their meaning wasn't immediately clear. John couched the words in beautifully crafted melodies, providing a yearning counterpoint to his own harpsichord playing on \\"I Need You to Turn To\\" and turning the lyrically opaque \\"Take Me to the Pilot\\" into one of the album's most memorable songs.<br /><br />John would craft dozens of songs and albums of great acclaim, but the roots of his 1970s musical domination of popular music can all be heard here.  Predating the outrageous stage costumes (and their attendant flamboyant persona), John's energy is fully focused on his music, his piano playing and his singing. The ballads are particularly powerful, from the radio perennial \\"Your Song,\\" to the spiritually charged \\"Border Song\\" and closing \\"The King Must Die.\\" The upbeat tunes, like \\"The Cage,\\" score with John's bluesy piano chords propelled by funky bass lines and horns.<br /><br />This 1996 CD reissue includes three bonus tracks from the album sessions: the non-LP B-side (to \\"Border Song\\"), \\"Bad Side of the Moon,\\" and both sides of the non-LP single \\"Rock 'n' Roll Madonna\\" b/w \\"Grey Seal.\\" The latter was re-recorded and released on the album \\"Goodbye Yellow Brick Road\\" (hence its familiarity to many listener's ears) but this is the original rendition. Song lyrics, a detailed album history and remastering from the original tapes make this a must-have for Elton fans and a terrific introduction to those who only know the radio hits.

B00005JO1Y|4.0|No one could have possibly imagined just a scant number of years ago that director Peter Jackson, remembered prior to 2001 for his low-budget horror pictures, would become the highest paid director in motion picture history? Or, more importantly, that he himself would be in charge of a nearly three-hundred million dollar budgeted major motion picture remake of the classic Merian C. Cooper monster movie, King Kong, from 1933? Peter Jackson would scarcely believe it himself if it were not for the fact that he is indeed living the dream. It is funny how things work out the way they do. A proper re-imagining of the famous stop-motion animation special effects extravaganza has been in the pipeline at Universal Pictures for quite some time, waiting for just the right script and the director to helm to come along. Sure, there was the Paramount Pictures take on King Kong in 1976. And while the film did manage to scrape ninety-million dollars worldwide into the kitty, the presence of Kong himself, basically makeup artist Rick Baker in a laughable monkey-suit, failed miserably to do the original justice in any sense of the word. Now, one-billion dollars in box office ticket sales and three Lord of the Rings films later, director Peter Jackson sets out to prove once more that nothing has ever nor will ever top nor equal the magnificence of Kong, the eighth wonder of the world! <br /> <br />The story for King Kong (2005) is undeniably reflective of the epic style of the 1933 original motion picture, a successful invocation of nostalgia on the part of director Peter Jackson who with this adaptation even surpasses the emotional intensity and high adrenaline rush of his Lord of the Rings series. With that said, King Kong regrettably has its fair share of flaws. The first one-third of the story is spent on bringing all the main characters of the film together onto the S.S. Venture destined for Skull Island. This portion of the picture is a bit slow to say the least but it allows audiences to become familiar with the personalities of the characters and set up the eventual confrontation with the dangers of Skull Island. The second section of the film, a majority of which take place on the island itself, is what truly makes up the movie. However it does stagger a bit as it draws closer to the final one-third of the picture leading the actions on screen to become repetitive and clichd. The last one-third of the movie in which Kong as a captive is brought in chains to New York City and goes on a rampage in search of Ann, leading to the final confrontation on top of the famous Empire State Building, is unquestionably the worst part of the film, though far be it from a total wash. As soon as Kong is captured on Skull Island and brought to New York City, the drama and intensity of the film begin to seriously go downhill from there. Regardless, there are quite a number of memorable moments in this portion of the film including Kong sliding across the frozen river with Ann Darrow and Jack Black delivering the infamous line, \\"It was Beauty that killed the Beast\\", which just leave the audience awe-struck. It feels as though Jackson rushes the events leading up to Kong's death and his fall from the Empire State Building onto the street below which in effect severely diminishes the anticipation and the emotional anxiety that led up to this moment in the film. <br /> <br />Naomi Watts is positively delightful in the role of struggling actress Ann Darrow who is recruited by motion picture director/producer Carl Denham to star in his adventure film and is then captured by the natives of Skull Island to be offered as a sacrifice to Kong. Like Kong himself, we the audience are entranced with her attractive appearance and sympathize with her life and desires early in the picture. King Kong will likely open a lot of doors for Miss Watts which is well deserved for the range of emotions she exhibits in this film. It is to be expected that few, if any really, tookthe casting of comedian Jack Black as Carl Denham in the Peter Jackson remake of the classic monster movie seriously at first glance, but he definitely silences his doubters. Black brings a certain amount of bitter humor and sarcasm to the role of a swaggering movie producer whose penchant for greatness is so excessive that he ends up destroying the very things he believed so strongly in. It is still a little difficult to accept Black within a dramatic role entirely but this should certainly help. He doesn't make the transition from comedy to drama as easily as Adam Sandler did with Punch Drunk Love but certainly no Jim Carrey either. And Adrien Brody is alright as Jack Driscoll who seems to all but disappear in the final hour of the picture. He works well as the everyman's hero and the foil to Bruce Baxter, the Hollywood action star who in reality is nothing more then a coward. <br /> <br />However, the best performance in the film is given by Andy Serkis. Not for his role as Cookie, the cook of the S.S. Venture whose demise on Skull Island is particularly gruesome to witness, but rather for his behind-the-scenes portrayal of Kong himself. What was done for Kong was similar to what Serkis did for the creature Gollum in the Lord of the Rings series. He was strapped with a special suit with sensors attached in specific places in order to capture not only his movements but also his facial expressions. Besides being one of the most realistic and distinguished computer animated creations in recent memory, Kong is furthermore one of the most emotionally grappling characters in the film, filling you with terror and excitement one moment and the next having at the verge of tears. Serkis simply does a positively phenomenal job at retaining Kong's wild natural instincts early on in the picture while at the same time slowly integrating subtle human-like characteristics into the role such as when Kong throws a temper tantrum like a little child when Ann refuses to amuse him any longer after he has knocked her down several times. <br /> <br />Overall, Peter Jackson's King Kong is truly a rare motion picture event that can honestly be defined as an epic in every capacity of the word. As was the case with the original, King Kong is far more then a monster movie. From beginning to end, Kong dazzles and amazes you. Terrifying, entrancing, and saddening, Jackson's reinvention of the classic 1933 film is one of the few remakes in recent Hollywood memory to actually do justice to its predecessor and in some areas even surpass it. This said however there do appear to be some issues with the film. The source of these problems may reside with director Peter Jackson's success following the lucrative Lord of the Rings trilogy and how it may very well have gone to his head, albeit unintentionally and unconsciously of course. Prior to Lord of the Rings, Jackson worked with what he had and that was that. However, with King Kong, post-LOTR, he has a nearly indefinite budget and unlimited resources at his disposal. Jackson's ability as a director to judge what should or should not be included in the finished product may have inadvertently been diminished because of this. He himself has admitted that there are hours of material not included in the final print of the movie which begs the question of what was left out of the film. There are scenes in King Kong, a majority of which appear in the second act of the movie, that are exhilarating but do nothing to advance either the plot or the message of the film. <br /> <br />Regardless, the action sequences and the impressive computer animation effects which accompany them are what truly make up this picture. The special effects, though not entirely pristine, are awe-inspiring. From the moment the characters set foot on Skull Island the action is nearly non-stop. This however can border on the excessive, particularly during the second portion of the movie more so right around the part where the crew of the S.S.Venture plummets down a chasm filled with man-eating giant insects. Anyhow, a majority of the action sequences do work effectively. One scene in particular in which Kong proceeds to toss Ann Darrow from paw to paw as he battles three tyrannosaurs at once will literally have you gasping for air and clutching the edge of your seat. It is just that intense. There are few additional sequences like that, but why spoil the surprise? <br /> <br />Parents with younger children eager to see Kong rampage his way through New York City however should strongly be cautioned because unlike the original 1933 King Kong film, or even a significant portion of Peter Jackson's own Lord of the Rings franchise for that matter, the gore, violence, and intensity of this adaptation are set onto overdrive throughout the entire picture which can be quite unnerving for children after three hours spent in a darkened movie theatre. Let's face it. Kong himself is an intimidating figure as it is. Throw in carnivorous tyrannosaurs, rampaging brontosauruses, creepy-crawly insects, gigantic spiders, man-eating razor-teeth sponges, and the ugliest, spectral natives you will ever lay eyes on and this is the stuff nightmares are made of. And, judging by the material in this film, there is enough to make them sleep with you in your bed for at least the next month. <br /> <br />And as much as composer James Newton Howard should be commended for taking up the arduous task of rescoring from scratch the entire three-hour motion picture event King Kong after Howard Shore and director Peter Jackson parted ways on the project, what he delivers in the film, albeit far from what can be described as a disaster, is nothing memorable. From the same man who brought us unforgettable scores from The Sixth Sense, Signs, and the NBC television drama ER, this is a pure disappointment, but not one which can entirely be placed, if at all, on his shoulders. Regardless of its fault, Peter Jackson successfully achieves his goal of bringing his own distinct vision to the King Kong legend while at the time paying reverence to the dignity and superior quality of the original motion picture on which the remake was based. Hollywood would do well in taking notes on this film as it demonstrates firmly how a remake should properly be made.

B00005JOFO|5.0|After watching this movie friends and I spent the next few hours discussing it.  It is a well done film no matter the subject, it is the story of two people in love who ache for each other and yet are forced to be apart.  Add to that the fact that both are men and the time is 1963 and you get the added story that makes this film particularly wrenching.  Jack and Enis meet when they are both hired to spend the summer up on Brokeback mountain tending to a herd of sheep.  Enis is quiet to the point of seeming almost mute and Jack is the more lively of the two.  One frozen night when huddled in the tent from the cold their supressed passion for each other becomes an irrisistable force and the two spend the remainder of their time on the mountain happy, or at least as happy as Enis's character can be.  Their summer ends with Jack saying that they could still be together and Enis being overcome with rage at the mere suggestion.  They last see each other as Jack is driving off and Enis is nonchalantly walking down a dirt street.  It is after Jack is gone that Enis breaks down in an unexpected and powerful scene, hiding in an ally-way so nobody will see.  Over the next several years they both marry and become fathers.  The scene of their reunion 4 years later has so much emotion, longing and passion that it will take your breath away.  They way they look at each other and that first kiss is one of the most powerful I've seen onscreen and I have to comend both actors.  This movie however is not just about Jack and Enis, but also shows the effect on their wives, Michelle Williams of Dawsons creek does an amazing job of playing the wife of Enis who discovers his secret but stays quiet because she sees no other option and Anne Hathaway saying Good-bye to her Princess Diary character with a flirty agreesive character and a topless scene as she sets her sight on Jack.  I won't go into the ending other than to say that the scene where Jacks parent are introduced is nearly as moving as their reunion scene and will leave you feeling wrung out.   <br />This is a film that will keep you invloved until the last credit on the screen goes blank and kudos to Ang Lee for putting such a memorable film onscreen.

Second, they stated there were no known issues with this title.<br /><br />The second part surely is true, the store released it early! Today, with the official release, I checked 5 other retailers, having them open the box and play Disk 5, telling them what I found. In every case, it was the same, Disk 5 has the same contents as disk 1 and is therefore missing the last 4 episodes.<br /><br />Over to you Sony.<br /><br />&lt;====<br /><br />Amazon posted a note to me (top of my shopping cart) that \\"Stargate Season 8 and Stargate Atlantis season 1 prices have increased\\",  since I placed them in my shopping cart.<br /><br />WELL I AM WAITING FOR SONY TO ANNOUCE A RECALL AND CORRECTION NOTICE.... AND POST THE NOTICE HERE AT AMAZON BEFORE I BUY.<br /><br />BUYER BEWARE ... RIGHT!?!!!<br /><br />I do not want to send away to get disc 5 corrected.<br /><br />And while they are at it, Sony should add a disc with the full-length version of the shortened episode.<br /><br />Who agrees with me?
B00003CXCT|1.0|It seems that the big argument surrounding this edition of the legendary Star Wars Trilogy is whether or not George Lucas had the right to make such drastic alterations.  Some claim he should not have tampered with a successful set of films, others declare he can do whatever he pleases since they are his films.  I prefer to run the middle road.  Honestly, I do prefer the original versions of these films, but I also think Mr. Lucas had every right in the world to make the changes he did.  I certainly don't agree with all of them, in fact there are a few I find to be quite harmful.  But, to be fair, there are some changes that I really do think are quite cool.  Simply put, there are some changes I liked, and some I did not like.  That's all there is to it.  In any case, I can understand George Lucas wanting to alter these films in one way or another.  I myself have had experiences where I've done something creative and then later on wanted to change it in some way, be it a slight tweak, or a drastic alteration, so I can respect Mr. Lucas' desire to change his groundbreaking film series in certain ways, both big and small.<br /><br />What I can't respect, however, is his attitude regarding the changes and his refusal to make the original theatrical versions readily available on DVD as well.  Choose any major motion picture that has an alternate version in existence, a director's cut or another \\"Special Edition\\" or the like, and the makers of these films almost always make the original versions available on DVD for the fans at the same time.  Films like Apocalypse Now, Legend, the Alien series, or Gladiator all have both their original theatrical incarnations available for purchase on DVD, along with extended or recut versions of them if the buyer so chooses to get them.  But George Lucas, in a very puzzling move, has felt the need to deny his fans of that option, the reasons for which I cannot understand.  As somebody interested in both writing and film, I would have loved the chance to contrast and compare the two versions of each of the Star Wars films against each other, all in the fantastic clarity that DVD technology offers.  Indeed, I would have leaped at the chance.  George Lucas took that chance away from me and many others like me, and that is what really destroyed my respect for him.  What kind of filmmaker does this to his fans simply because of his own selfish desires?<br /><br />Mr. Lucas maintains the argument that any great artist through the centuries in just about any medium, be it painting, music or film, would want to be able to go back and change their work in some way.  That is true, of course.  As the saying goes, art is never finished, only abandoned.  But does George Lucas honestly expect us to believe that after any of these changes are made, the original versions are to be disregarded and forgotten forever, even after making such a huge impact on society for so many years?  If Beethoven was suddenly able to completely alter his Ode to Joy so that it is almost unrecognizable from the original that people would not still harbor a love for the original variation after its tremendous influence on the world?  No, art doesn't work that way.  I'm not saying the Special Editions of these movies deserve to be shunned, but after nearly three decades of redefining film and making an unbelievably huge impact on society in general, the original versions don't deserve to be forgotten either. They still have a place in almost everyone's heart, and that's what George Lucas shouldn't have the right to try to undo.<br /><br />That's not the worst of Mr. Lucas' attitude behind this DVD release.  What really bothers me is how he has recently been appearing publicly to use his celebrity status, and even uses the dialogue and prominent themes in his new Star Wars films, to blather on and on about how great and wonderful democracy is, how precious it is to our society, and how it must be protected at any cost, only to then back over himself and act like a complete dictator.  The moment the fans speak up saying they want to see the original versions of the original Star Wars films on DVD, suddenly George Lucas invokes a \\"what I say goes,\\" policy.  Suddenly, what the fans have to say no longer matters.  Suddenly, democracy conveniently no longer applies.  It's a pretty heinous thing to see this man publicly rambling about his love of democracy, then listen to him in interviews in which he boldly states that he \\"doesn't care what his fans think.\\"  That is an absolutely vile and hypocritical stance for someone who claims to value democracy so much to have, and I am seriously taken aback by such a blatant miscarriage of his own principles.  All I'm saying is if George Lucas is going to drag his personal politics into his craft, and is going to preach and pontificate about the importance of democracy, then he should support it every step of the way, not when it merely suits him best and makes him look good in front of his fellow Hollywood big shots.  Star Wars fans should have the right to choose which versions of these great films they want to see on DVD, not have George Lucas spurn them and make the decision for them as if they aren't capable of doing so, then tell them they can just watch the old versions on VHS tapes or Laserdiscs. Being forced to choose between seeing only the heavily altered versions on DVD, or seeing the original versions on substandard, out-of-date (not to mention expensive and difficult to find) formats like VHS or Laserdisc is not what I would call a reasonable or fair decision to be faced with.  Practice democracy, Mr. Lucas.  That's the only way I and many others will respect you again.<br /><br />George Lucas himself has also made clear his hesitation to release the unaltered versions due to the cost.  Remastering older movies is definitely an expensive endeavor, for sure.  While I'm a little skeptical about that since he has such vast wealth, I'm not going to tell a man how to spend his money.  Hey, millions of dollars are still millions of dollars, no matter how wealthy you are, and a decision of such immense cost should never be taken lightly.  That's why I think those of us who want George Lucas to make the extraordinary effort and expense to bring these beloved movies back to us unaltered should be more civil.  Writing angry reviews and cursing and personally insulting Mr. Lucas, while simultaneously demanding he release the unaltered versions is not the way to get an artist to cooperate.<br /><br /> If George Lucas was generous enough to fulfill my wishes, I would definitely get the Special Editions along with them.  Like I said, I would love to be able to compare the two versions against each other and weigh the strengths and weaknesses of the two.  I'd love to see the versions without the changes I disliked alongside the versions with the changes I actually enjoyed.  It would be the perfect balance.  But until I see the original versions of these fine films on DVD, and more importantly until Mr. Lucas develops a better attitude, then I'm not interested.ike a complete dictator.

B000BKVQTS|5.0|First off let me say that i am downright pissed off with some of the reviews. Just because this is not the watered down, sugar coated, junk of Diney does not mean this a bad movie. If you want to watch some stupid move like Americian Pie then by all means watch it. Just know all humans have their own views and thoughts on things. What you find offensive another person might find very good or visa-versa. Also, if you are going to watch this movie then be sure you research the subject material first. <br />Secondly, people are complaining that this movie is too dark and convuluted. If you ever read the ACTUAL Grimms fairy tales you will find they were dark and menacing. The tales were written to keep kids from doing stupid stuff. Most of the tales did not end on a Disney note. For example, one sister of Cinderella chopped her toes off while the other sister chopped her hells off. Also, you have to be familiar with Terry style of directing.   <br />In addition, their was no gratuitus nudity. Yes you did see some cleavege but that was it. There was nothing overtly sexual at all. I thought that was a very wise decision on Terry part.  <br />Finally, Terry used his skills as a director to weave in a lot of references to to the tales. I give Terry all the credit in the world for be able to pull this off.  <br />In conclusion, if you read the tales and not rely on the sugar coated Disney junk then you will enjoy this movie! Also, have a adult there if you are letting your child watch this.
B000000W6F|5.0|If I had reviewed this album a few months ago I probably would've given it a 4-star rating, but this album continues to grow on me. Each time I listen to it, I come closer to understanding how some call this their favorite Pumpkins album. This album is more 'grunge' than their others, with some hard rockers like I am One, Siva, Bury Me and Tristessa, but it includes many mellow, beautiful tracks as well, like Rhinoceros, Crush, Suffer and Daydream.. then some gradually build and alternate between hard and soft, like Window Paine and Snail. All songs are incredible, but I prefer the mellower ones; in my opinion, the Pumpkins harder stuff is better on Siamese Dream than on here. I recommend this album to anyone, especially if you prefer Siamese Dream to their later works.
B000BW7QWW|5.0|Serenity, the movie title, illustrates not only the name of the ship in which the main characters reside, it also expresses the overall theme to what makes the characters and story work. <br /> <br />To be successful, you must keep your head and find your inner serenity. The rebels that live on Serenity do just that, each in there own way, and thus, in the end, are successful in saving the woman secretly trained to be a secret weapon and, ultimately, exposing the forced Manchurian Candidate-type training that is being done to the gifted children of the universe. <br /> <br />The crew of Serenity are members of the rebel army, the rebel army that has lost the intergalactic war and are now homeless losers and potentially war criminals (depending on what world you are on). <br /> <br />The Captain, who holds everyone's spirit together, is having a hard time of it himself when he finds out the woman and her brother that he is transporting have a big secret: the woman is a secretly trained military weapon who has excaped from her training ground and is being hunted by the powers of control to bring her back to forced-training camp where she is tortured with mind control and manipulation. Her brother asks only that they drop them off, but the Captain and brother being close, help each other evade the authorities and find closure to their demons. <br /> <br />Though not for small kids, this movie had very good pacing and beautiful spaceships, with a lot of funny one-liners and sassy wit. <br /> <br />I'd recommend this movie to all for a night of spaceship chasing fun.
B000BW7QWW|5.0|I got my Serenity DVD today.  Now I'm ready for more.  More Firefly, more Serenity, more Browncoats, more Verse.  This movie is excellent.  Watching the DVD was even better than seeing it in the theater.  I had expectations and hopes in the theater:  hope that it would make money and hope that it would be good.  Today I could let go of all that and just watch it.  It was fantastic.  A great science fiction film that will join Firefly in cult status.  Now I'm a Joss junkie and I'm jonesin' for my next fix.
B0000024IE|5.0|This is one of the best records ever made - there's no more direct way to put it. But perhaps what stands out most about it - behind all the controversial politics - is the production, the way the Bomb Squad managed to bend and shape all of these densely-layered, often abstract washes of sound into the most unlikely melodies. If this were released today, tomorrow, or perhaps even ten years from now it would still be ahead of its time. A masterpiece.
B00062J00S|5.0|I grew up in a town like Bedford Falls. Now I live in the big city. This movie captures the flavor of both, which provides just one more reason for its widespread appeal. My brother-in-law and I both considered it one of our favorite movies. He liked it so much, he actually became George Bailey in real life (worked as VP for a small town bank, and made loans recommendations based more on the quality of the borrower than on their credit rating). At family gatherings, we played a form of Trivia based entirely on this movie... he once stumped me with the following question: where does the bank examiner live? You'll just have to watch the movie to find out. I'll hazard saying one word against this beloved movie... don't rely on an accurate portrayal of angels, nor of what happens to people after they die (we don't become angels, folks)!
B000AYEIZY|5.0|I saw the PBS special and liked it. After viewing the DVD with stereo sound and the extra content, I feel comfortable saying that this is a must have for your collection. The purists reviews that I have read find a few faults as they always do but this DVD set is the real deal.
B000A42QIU|5.0|Very is quite different from the Pet Shop Boys most people are familiar with.  In the past were songs like Being Boring, West End Girls, Rent, It's A Sin etc... which are for the most part, mid-tempo electronic rock.  Very reminds me a lot of the direction that OMD went after McCluskey and Humphreys went separate ways, think Sugar Tax and Liberator era.  Of course most people are familiar with Can You Forgive Her which was a pretty big hit back in the early 90's, but after the opening track finishes off, you're hit with I Wouldn't Normally Do This Kind Of Thing, a straight up dancy disco rocker.  The pace of this album rarely lets up except for a few slower ballady songs (Liberation, Dreaming of the Queen, To Speak Is A Sin) and finishes off with an outstanding version of the Village People's Go West.  I like this album a lot, it is one of my favorites because it is so upbeat and energetic, and of course because the Pet Shop Boys are incredible.  I would recommend this album to fans of newer OMD, New Order, Erasure, Intuition, Neuropa.
B000002LHX|4.0|In 1989, Warner Brothers was preparing to release Tim Burton's BATMAN.  Depending on who you hear it from, either the president of Warner or the Joker himself (and huge Prince fan) Jack Nicholson reccomended that the Purple One contribute songs to the soundtrack.  In the end, Prince's BATMAN soundtrack topped the album charts for six weeks and spawned 4 hit singles, a marked improvement over the critical and commercial bomb that was LOVESEXY. <br /> <br />The songs that The Joker/Jack Napier \\"sings\\" are probably the best.  \\"Electric Chair\\" is a great hard rocker with some excellent lyrics.  \\"Partyman\\" is an awesome funk workout that made the Pop Top 20 and was used to great effect in the film during the scene where the Joker and his thugs trash the Gotham Museum of Art.  The pop/funk of \\"Trust\\" also appears in the film during the parade scene. <br /> <br />Batman/Bruce Wayne gets some good songs as well.  \\"The Future\\" opens the album on a dark, spare note and uses Michael Keaton's iconic \\"I'm Batman\\" line.  \\"Vicki Waiting\\" is an enjoyable straight pop song.  \\"Scandalous\\" is an awesome soul ballad that features over the film's end credits.  It also made the Top 5 on the R&B charts.   <br /> <br />The Sheena Easton duet \\"The Arms of Orion\\" unfortunately falls flat.  It's one of the most sappy songs Prince has written and lacks the energy of the Prince/Easton hit \\"U Got the Look.\\"  Surprisingly it made the Pop Top 40. <br /> <br />\\"Lemon Crush\\" is Prince singing from the viewpoint of Vicki Vale and features some great falsetto vocals. <br /> <br />The album ends with \\"Batdance,\\" a pastiche of the album, film, and the '60s Batman theme.  Nicholson, Keaton, and Kim Basinger all have vocal cameos as the character of Gemini (Batman-meets-The Joker) makes his only appearance.  It topped the pop charts and the memorable video was a fixture on MTV. <br /> <br />This is not Prince's best album; that honor would fall either to PURPLE RAIN or SIGN O'THE TIMES.  BATMAN, however,is a worthwhile album.  Written and performed entirely by him and written to the deadline of a blockbuster feature film, it finds Prince at his best as a one man band and as a pop craftsman.
B00028HBKC|4.0|I've seen two films which left a packed public theatre audience speechless: The Passion and Private Ryan. After both films, you could have heard a pin drop in those theatres. I guess it took a few minutes for most of us to get our minds around the supreme display of self sacrifice (however dramatized) we had just witnessed. For mature(thinking) audiences only... regardless of your personal politics. <br /> <br />The Passion, much like Private Ryan, is not a film I would choose to see a second time. The images, emotions and thoughts are etched into my mind. But I have no regretts for paying to see them once... both films left me with alot to think about, for a very, very long time. <br /> <br />I think every adult so inclined, should elect see this film once.
0061020710|4.0|In a journey that seems secondary only in absurdity to Don Quixote, Terry Pratchett introduces readers to Discworld in \\"The Color of Magic\\".  While this is not the strongest book in the series, it is entertaining.  It is the typical wacky humor that Pratchett readers know and love.    The hopelessly inept wizard Rhincewind is given a proposition he can not refuse.  He is to be a tour guide to a tourist named Twoflower.  Along the way, the duo narrowly avoid death while introducing us to several recurring characters in the Discworld series.  Fortunately, they have the luggage to protect them.  The one shortcoming I found in this book is a direct result of the plot.  Because the journey causes them to jump rapidly from one strange land to another, the story can be hard to follow at times.  Perhaps the strain would be decreased if Pratchett wrote short chapters or more breaks in his stories.    There are a number of Pratchett books I have already read and there are more that I am looking forward to reading.  I felt I had to start from the beginning to truly appreciate the series.  I think you should as well.  All great stories have a beginning, no matter how absurd they may seem.
B00005JO04|5.0|Great movie. Should help wake some people up!!! We have a lot of enemies out there that would LOVE to do us in.
B000002UAO|5.0|1965 was a busy year for the Beatles.  They spent the first part of the year filming their second film HELP! and working on the accompanying soundtrack album.  Following the success of that project, they embarked on another world tour before beginning work on RUBBER SOUL.  They started work on October 12 with December 3 as the deadline for the album to ship.  Wow!  It's amazing they turned out so many great songs in such sort time. <br /> <br />Even more so than on HELP!, John Lennon is under the influence of Bob Dylan's acoustic storytelling.  \\"Norwegian Wood\\" with its famous George Harrison sitar and highly confessional lyrics remains a stone cold classic.  \\"Girl\\" is another acoustic classic.   John does break out the electric on \\"Run for Your Life\\" an even darker continuation of the jealous John heard on \\"You Can't Do That.\\"  He also wrote \\"The Word\\" which almost foretells the coming hippie movement.  He also contributed \\"Nowhere Man\\" an absolute classic with deep lyrics and some great Lennon/McCartney/Harrison harmonies. <br /> <br />Paul McCartney adds to the acoustic mood with \\"Michelle.\\"  \\"You Won't See Me\\" is an unjustly forgotten pop/rocker with more great Beatle harmonies.  \\"I'm Looking Through You\\" takes a darker look into Paul's relationship with Jane Asher. <br /> <br />John and Paul collaborate on the opening rocker \\"Drive My Car,\\" the beautiful \\"In My Life,\\" and \\"Wait,\\" which was actually a leftover from the HELP! sessions.  They also worked with Ringo on \\"What Goes On\\" a countryish track which was his first songwriting credit. <br /> <br />George Harrison's previous songwriting contributions had been rather routine pop tunes but he steps into the big leagues with is two songs on RUBBER SOUL.  \\"Think For Yourself\\" features some dark lyrics and fuzzbass from Paul.  \\"If I Needed Someone\\" is even better with its Byrds-influenced arrangement and harmonies. <br /> <br />Upon its release, RUBBER SOUL was the Fab Four's best album yet.  The best, however, was yet to come...
0307276902|3.0|I am an attorney. Many of my clients have problems with alcohol. This book is informative but if you want to look at alcohol and drug addiction with a totally different perspective, read Beyond Reason by Harvard's Roger Fisher. It can help anyone who is in a relationship with someone who has a drug or alcohol problem.  You won't be able to make them better (only they can help themselves), but you will be able to understand more about their emotional state. Beyond Reason helps you to understand your emotions and others.  Once you achieve that, you at least have some information that is helpful to you.  I have used the information in Beyond Reason with many of my clients.  It has helped me very much.
B0009WFFS6|5.0|The sound quality of this DVD is excellent, the performance of Cream is excellent. Cream performed as good as they did thirty years ago, only mellower and more polished. The 2 DVD set is well worth collecting. The drum solo at the end of the concert was superb. The performance of Sunshine of Your Love brought back good memories of the 60s and early 70s. Cream fans should definitely buy it, Eric Clapton fans should buy it, Jack Bruce fans should buy it, Ginger Baker fans should buy it.
B00005AQE8|5.0|No competition tupac all eyez on Me cd is the best cd ever made. Great Production, Great Lyrics, when you listen to this cd, you feel the emotion that was put into it. You can listen the whole cd over and over again and not get tired of it. <br />Plain and simple tupac is the best artist all time.
B00005QZWI|5.0|Tolkien wrote a literary masterpiece.  I read it more than 30 years ago and was impressed then.  As a movie it was fantastic, one of the rare movies from a book that is faithful and true to the mind's eye.  Every LOTR fan that I know felt that the movie was a masterpiece.  The score is perfect for the movie.  It is not trite. It was not a commercialized effort to write as many tunes as possible so that a soundtrack would be a best seller.  The soundtrack was meant for the movie and it did an aweome job.  As far as albums go, it may be repetitive.  It may not have tunes that are easily whistled or hummed.  It is unlikely to have a hit theme song that will be played on the radio.  However, as a movie soundtrack, it was superb for the very reason that it enhanced the movie and was an integral part of the whole.  That explains why it does not stand as well on its own.  I enjoy the album, not because it has great songs, but because it exudes the sense of LOTR.  It is a tone poem of sorts.  It exudes a mood.  There is darkness, but there is also hope.   There is fear, but there is courage.  If you liked the movie and enjoyed the score, you will like the album.  If you are looking for a standard movie soundtrack written with record sales in mind, then this is not an album that listens well as a stand alone. It must be understood in the context of the story and the movie.  Also, be aware that the same album came out with multiple covers.  Mine has Arwen on the front, but there were also  versions with Frodo, or Sam or others from the story.  The album inside is the same.
B0007N1AI6|5.0|The Tour for this CD was amazing just like this CD. There isnt really anything i could say that hasnt been said, and all the other reviews that break it down my song seem to be pretty accurate to how i feel. something I must mention Again is that Judas Rising shows Halford is god. I was literally Jumping up and down yelling \\"Priest IS BACK!\\" when i heard that song. Great Comeback, Fits perfectly on my shelf next to my other Priest classics.
B000001F45|4.0|\\"The Magician's Birthday\\" was the second Heep album by the classical line-up featuring Hensley, Byron, Box, Thain and Kerslake. It was also the second album with a Roger Dean cover. And moreover, it was the second album the band released in 1972.<br /><br />After a long 1972 tour Uriah Heep were rushed back into the Lansdowne studios to record a follow-up to their break-through and much acclaimed album \\"Demons and Wizzards\\".<br /><br />As Hensley states in the notes, they felt that were never really given the time it took to record the album, which was originally planned to be a \\"complete\\" concept album. Though it may have been rushed it nearly matches its great predecessor. The band, and especially Hensley as a songwriter, were at the peak of their creativity and many of these songs have become classics and favourites. The extensive list of bonus-tracks clearly illustrates what a great period this was for the band. Unfortunately the hard work took its toll on some of the band-members; but that's another story.<br /><br />The first track, Hensley's dramatic \\"Sunrise\\", is the perfect opener, with great lead and harmony vocals.<br /><br />Another highlight is the melodic rocker \\"Blind Eye\\", driven by acoustic guitars and featuring a nice twin-guitar theme; also a Ken Hensley song.<br /><br />Two songs released as single A-sides were \\"Spider Woman\\" (Europe) and \\"Sweet Lorraine\\" ( America), and where the first is a rather traditional heavy-rocker, \\"Sweet Lorraine\\" has all it takes to become a classic. Great whining riff, fine breaks and a catchy chorus. Simply one of the most memorable Heep recordings; written by Box, Byron and Thain.<br /><br />As the most versatile songwriter in the band Hensley also demonstrates a talent for writing melodic ballads such as \\"Echoes in the Dark\\" and the quiet piano accompanied \\"Rain\\" with great lead vocals.<br /><br />\\"Tales\\" is the closest the band get to playing folk-rock on the record; another fine recording.<br /><br />Though the title track has its moments, it somehow feels too longwinded with its ten and a half minutes playing time.<br /><br />Among the bonus-tracks Gary Thain's \\"Crystal Ball\\" is a nice surprise; sad that his constitution was strong enough to take the strain of heavy touring etc.<br /><br />Though not quite as consistent as \\"Demons and Wizzards\\" still one of Heep's finest albums.> <br />Though the title track has its moments, it somehow feels too longwinded with its ten and a half minutes playing time. <br /> <br />Among the bonus-tracks Gary Thain's \\"Crystal Ball\\" is a nice surprise; sad that his constitution was strong enough to take the strain of heavy touring etc. <br /> <br />Though not quite as consistent as \\"Demons and Wizzards\\" still one of Heep's finest albums.
014100018X|5.0|Much like the food she often describes in her book, Harris's writing itself is also delicious!<br /><br />It is easy to see why Chocolat was made into a movie.  With remarkable characters, scenery and story- this book makes for a good read.  What is nice about this book is that it doesn't just center on Vianne and her daughter who own the Chocolate shop, we also get a good look at several other characters that play a part.  We meet a fascist priest, an abusive husband and his mousey wife, a friendly gypsie, a eccentric old lady...These characters along with Vianne, make up the substance of this book and the story.<br /><br />I'd recommend this book to anyone who enjoys a good story.
B00000294R|5.0|DAMN! you got to get this album Big L is crazy! To bad he died so young, he could have made more albums and been the greatest lyricist and one of the greatest rappers of all time. Every verse in every song is crazy. I have to pause this album all the time to think about what he said then I realize and im like what!? and laugh cause his words are so good. This album will really make you stop and think. He is up there with Pac and Biggie, no doubt. Also get his other album The Big Picture. If you people don't get these albums i'll be knockin out so many teeth the tooth fairy will go bank rupt and put so much led in you you'll dick would be used as a pencil, Peace. <br /> <br />R.I.P - Big L
B000063DFN|5.0|Amazing CD. Amazing band. My only complaint it that i neglected to see them live on the tour for it. Flawless, This cd is so amazing its hard to put into words. If you dont believe me, buy it, it is better then all the other metal \\"masterpieces\\" such as Master of Puppets. I hear a lot of complaints that all Maiden CDs sound the same. Steve Harris has lots of similar Bass lines and the guitar is very similar on some songs sure, but its not about that. if you listen to the lyrics, they are on another level. The music is simply Amazing. Maiden is not about being the best, it is about the feeling. And the Feeling is here my friends, stronger then even on Number of The Beast. Aces high is probably my favorite song, but the title track is great too.  <br /> <br />A MUST HAVE. for any metal fan, no, any music fan.
B00000253N|5.0|Bob Dylan in my opinion has always been at his best with an acoustic guitar and a harmonica holder around his neck. <br />I have always liked the Folk or acoustic side of Bob Dylan much better than his electric side. <br />Blood on the tracks is a throw back to the days of The Freewheelin Bob Dylan and The Times they are a Changing. <br />Some of the best songs of Dylans career appear on this album. <br />Tangled up in blue starts the album out in classic style with ten verses talking about Bob and a long lost girl friend. <br />Dylan has always been a great story teller, and this song is no exception. <br />Simple Twist of Fate is next and in pretty much the same vain as Tangled up in Blue. <br />Idiot Wind is another classic.  <br />When you see her say Hello, is one of the better efforts on the album, which reminds me of Girl from the North Country in some ways. <br />Shelter from the Storm is another classic song on this CD and one of my all-time personal favorite Dylans songs. <br />This is one of Dylans all-time classic albums and no collection is complete with out this album. <br />
B000B8QEZG|5.0|This is the \\"good old Madonna\\" that I know and remember from the days of True Blue and Like a Prayer!  While of course her music has grown so much, her lyrics, style, taste, sound etc.- this is a CD I think all of her fans, new and old will wear out their CD player on!<br /><br />Hung Up- Her new \\"it\\" song.<br /><br />Get Together- Good song, good beat.<br /><br />Sorry- Probably my 2nd best of this CD.  LOVE this song- beat, lyrics, everything.<br /><br />Future Lovers- This is one of my least fav's on this CD.  It's ok.<br /><br />I Love NY- I don't care for this one so much either.  Still good to dance to though.<br /><br />Let it Be- Great song, good mix.<br /><br />Forbidden Love- New song, old title.  Makes you feel like dancing.<br /><br />Jump- Also one of my best on this CD.  Love the meaning behind the lyrics, awesome style and sound.<br /><br />How High- Great meaning behind this song, not the best on here though, but still good.<br /><br />Isaac- Didn't like this one at first, but it's really grown on me.  Makes me want to get up and dance.<br /><br />Push- Great song.  I really like how Madonna manages to take dance songs and add a bit of meaning.<br /><br />Like it or Not- Fun song!<br /><br />Overall, I'd recommend this CD to all Madonna fans.  I think I have already listened to it as much as her last few CDs and I've had those for years!  This is a bit of the old Madonna, fun dance songs!  Welcome back!
0060922583|5.0|Yes, yes, yes.  With an open mind, this makes perfect sense.<br />Let the nay-sayers go their own way because they are stuck on their own beliefs like addicts.  I do like that analogy Michael Talbot.<br />I say in my title \\"see author Jane Roberts\\" because in her books as dictate by \\"Seth\\" these very same ideas were put forth as truths many years ago.

B0000542DH|5.0|The first time I saw this whole movie, I thought that maybe it was a bit too much; killing Mabel, the prison riot, and what have you. It left me feeling icky, wrong, dirty, etc. <br />The next time I watched it, it didn't gross me out as much. What's more, I began to notice other things about the film. I loved the superimposition, all of the weird camera work, Mallory's life as a sitcom, and the satire of serial killers.  <br />It's been pointed out before, but this movie plays on the fact that our serial killers in America are, more or less, legitimate celebrities. And it's not all bad for them either. Law enforcement and very adult people denounce them, saying they're disgusting, monsters and whatnot. Kids, on the other hand, are intrigued, and sometimes think they're cool, in a manner of speaking. <br />Also, I liked the twisted love story of Mickey and Mallory. It was touching. Bloody, and vile, but touching. <br />Great movie, hands down. I wish I could give it 8 or 10 stars.
0790737345|2.0|I saw Wings of Desire when it was in theaters years ago.  So I'm sitting home tonight with little to do, and I turn on City of Angels on FX -- not knowing anything about it -- and realize after a while that it's got to be a remake of WoD.  I guess you have to buy into the idea that life with God just can't quite compete with life here on earth.  Unfortunately, I didn't buy the idea in German, and I can't buy it in English either.  I will say that this version is not as depressing as the German version, but, hey, that's not saying much.  WoD is something I would expect Debbie Downer and Bob Bummer to take in as a date flick.
B0002Y69NG|5.0|If you think the second two films were really bad, and dont believe the Matrix Trilogy is amazing in its own right, I really believe you should visit this website: <br /> <br />[...] <br /> <br />This is an explanation of the true meaning and symbolism behind the religious/spiritual journey that is the story of the Matrix.  Believe me, once you read this, you will be blown away by these movies and you will DEFINITELY want to watch them all over again, especially Reloaded and Revolutions. <br /> <br />Do yourselves a favor, take a hour of so of your time, read these essays(There is a link for Reloaded at the top), and you'll thank me later.
B000AADYYO|5.0|I love Opeth and i love this cd, while they sometimes tend to recycle riffs and passages, their stuff is so brillant you can't really complain. Along with Morningrise this is my favorite Opeth cd. If you dig Opeth - order this today!
B000001IPL|5.0|Yes, I am a true offspring fan (obviously!). I do admit, this cd, Ignition, and self-titled (even though it does not have the world's best recording technology) are their best cds. I hate all this crap about 1998 and above being crap. It's not. People these days only pay attention to the singles, and judge them by that. They don't buy the cd for The Offspring's greatness, because they judge the newer stuff based on the singles like Original Prankster and Pretty Fly. Like on Conspiracy of One, the bests songs are Million Miles Away, Dammit I Changed Again, Come Out Swinging, and Denial, Revisited. They are great with wonderful vocals and as usual, awesome air-guitar-worthy guitar riffs. And on Americana, No Brakes, Americana, Staring at the Sun, and the absolutely magnificent single The Kids Aren't Alright.  <br /> <br />People need to stop paying attention to how \\"poppy\\" the singles are, and realize that behind the singles is what the offspring truly is. <br /> <br />Now for smash, i really don't know what my favorite is, Smash or Ignition. Buy Ignition for Session, Dirty Magic, and plenty of others. Smash is A-M-A-Z-I-N-G. Have a tough day? Listen to this cd and punch a pillow or two, or drive super fast listening to Bad Habit (just, don't get caught! ;) ). <br /> <br />I'm telling you my fellow Offspringers, but it, AND all the other cds not based on the singles! Behind those singles, is the super-fast punk stuff all of us true fans love.  <br /> <br />Oh, and Genocide is NOT a rip off Change the World, moron. Genocide came first. and Genocide is brilliant. Love it. <br /> <br />
B000BO0LLS|5.0|OK first of all 17 No1 records YAY!!!    I had to write a review of the reviews on this site as they are so stupid. This hasn't been released 4 times, there is the original and the platinum edition..one with a DVD and one without.  Ye i agree that the Platinum Edition should be the only edition but im glad they improved the original with some great new songs and a DVD with the videos.  And if you notice all the bad reviews are from the same person over and over again calling Mariah fat!! AS IF!! i've seen mariah in real life and she is lovely. She deserves alot of praise as this is a great album as was Glitter! If you own the original mimi download the new songs no one is making you buy the new album, its for fans and people who don't have the original. Get over it!! and for the haters just grow up!! mariah is here to stay.  I just have to add if you look at the 1 star reviews the are all by \\"A kid Reviewer\\" its just the same person wasting time over and over again! Get a life man.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|This is hands down the best science-fiction series ever -- and that's coming from a Star Trek fan from WAY back (I'm old enough to remember seeing the show when it first aired). I'm also a long time reader of science fiction books and suffer from a lifelong frustration over the fact that so few movies, and fewer TV series, seem to get sci-fi right. <br />  <br />Here's a show that does,and its a shame so few people heard about it -- I never did when it was on the air in fact. But I saw the Serenity movie in a theater and was intrigued, so I got the series DVDs, and was blown away. <br /> <br />This is unlike any other Sci-Fi series ever made, and a lot of it is more in what's NOT there than what is. No space aliens. No ridged foreheads. No epic space battles. No SOUND in space (a realistic touch few sci-fi shows have the guts to employ.)  No sensors, no shields -- the starring ship \\"Serenety\\" doesn't have any weapons at all (except the ones the crew packs in their holsters). <br /> <br />What the show does have is interesting characters and interesting stories. The crew of Serenety, a \\"Firefly class\\" freelance cargo hauler, is a motley bunch, and the interplay between these very different people is well-written, well-acted and great fun to watch, as they travel from the inner \\"civilized\\" planets to the outer \\"frontier\\" ones, smuggling a little, doing an illegal salvage here and there, brawling frequently in dusty saloons and generally behaving more or less as one would imagine space pirates doing. Its a clever mix of sci-fi and western, and although one might not think of the two as compatible, the show does a good job of making it feel natural that the people, places and events that take place on the frontier planets would look a lot like, well, the frontier. <br />  <br />What's most amazing is that these people managed to hit their stride right from the first frame. Remember the Star Trek spinoffs, each of which seemed to take a half season or more for the actorsto loosen up and settle into their roles? By comparison, the cast of \\"Firefly\\" feel like they've been working in these roles for years. Which is somewhat ironic since they were allowed less than a season in which to show their stuff. I can only hope that that FOX or some other network with more sense will see fit to pick this show up again and give it a chance to become what it deserves to be. <br />
B0009WFFS6|5.0|This is indeed a great preformance. I was a bit too young to see them the first time around, but I have their CD box set, and they have the same great sound as they did back in the day. While Eric and Ginger look fine, Jack on the other hand has not faired so well in the \\"getting older dept.\\" He looks like he is the OLD man of the group. I enjoy this DVD so much, I just wish it had been longer. Disc 1 is 83 minutes long and that's fine, but Disc 2 is a mere 42 minutes. I would have preferred a single DVD of 125 minutes so I could see the entire concert at once. Or if not one disc then add more music. The concert was over a four day period, so I'm sure there was more. Songs like \\"Tales Of Brave Ulysses\\", \\"Those Were The Days\\", and \\"Traintime\\" among others would've been great add-ons. Oh well, such is life. Still, if you don't already own it, get out there and pick up a copy.
B0002OERI0|5.0|First of all i wanna say how much i hate people who say they love green day and have only heard the singles of american idiot. Lets start with the things wrong with this cd: first of all its 2 pop and way 2 different than the other green day albums. For i own dookie,nimrod and international super hits. Secondly it is way 2 popular. They were popular b4 now they are they biggest band in america. Now the positives: while the singles are way 2 popular/overplayed they are still very good. I love seeing how much they have grown up and matured in 13 something years. They have improved musicly and vocally but they sound like a different band and i miss the old bad ass way of making music that they used 2 have.<br /><br />1.American idiot-title track/first single,nice guitars4/5<br /><br />2.Jesus of suburbia-a 9 minute song WOW, very intresting 2 hear the different tempos5/5<br /><br />3.Holiday-one of my favorites of the  album5/5<br /><br />4.Boulevard of broken dreams-most popular track of the album and maybe the year. overplayed but still good 5/5<br /><br />5.Are we the waiting-a nice slow track 5/5<br /><br />6.St jimmy-really cool up beat song4/5<br /><br />7.Give me novacine-not one of my favorites3/5<br /><br />8.Shes a rebel-pretty good track4/5<br /><br />9.Never listened 2 this track n/a<br /><br />10.letter bomb-good track with a nice intro4/5<br /><br />11.wake me up....-another hit single with a nice slow tempo5/5(2 pop though)<br /><br />12.Homecoming-another long song but i really love it5/5<br /><br />13.whatsername-i love this song which is a great ending 2 a great album 5/5
0596007124|5.0|I reviewed many of the excellent books on design patterns to select the best book for a senior level undergraduate course on design patterns.  I selected Head First Design Patterns for the fall 2005 semester. The students and I really enjoyed the book and learned a lot. Fourteen design patterns are covered  in a logical manner leading up to an excellent coverage of Model View Controller. The examples are superb and introduce many advanced java features such as reflection, threads, servlets and remote method invocation. I highly recommend it as a non traditional textbook that effectively teaches design patterns and good object oriented design practices. I plan on using it again next year.
B000063Y8F|4.0|Everyone in my family (parents, aunts, uncles, siblings) has the Zyliss, and I have one from my college days. They are great presses - efficient mechanism, no parts to misplace (except the cleaning tool), little waste. However, as my husband pointed out, they are rather difficult to clean thoroughly. <br /> <br />The Rosle press requires much less physical strength than the Zyliss and is a bit easier to clean (since the grate handily  pops up for that task). However, it seems to trap a bit more of the garlic in the grate (more waste, hence four stars). The bottom line is that I find myself using the Rosle over the Zyliss more and more; it just feels better in your hands. <br /> <br />A couple tips: peel garlic first if you have many cloves to press and don't want to interrupt pressing to unclog the grate AND hold onto the grate's thumb tab for your first clove so your garlic doesn't go flying.
B00005JO1Y|5.0|I hate to rehash everything that's already been said about this film.  The cast was great.  Peter Jackson shows why his the big pimp in Hollywood and the audience leaves the theatre completely satisfied.  Kudos really goes to the special effect team.  I see quite a few Oscars for this film in the future.  Naomi Watts (the new scream queen) managed to have a wonderful chemistry with with all likeihood a blue screen.<br /><br />For those who haven't seen this film, don't go in thinking that you've been there done that.  You haven't.  This film manage to turn me into one of those people I hate--someone who talks to the screen through the film. (I tried to keep it down--I swear.)<br /><br />Great film.
B000002UAX|5.0|The Beatles' self titled album from 1968, famously known as The White Album, is regarded as a rock classic; a genuine demonstration of how a powerful rock band can make music just for the sake of making it, and put all the songs from the recording sessions on the album without a care in the world. That, in a nutshell, explains why The White Album is a double album.  <br /> <br />The music on The White Album ranges from mellow: Lennon's tearful ode to his mother Julia, the magnificent Dear Prudence, and the bedtime lullaby Good Night, sung by Ringo, with it's wonderful string arrangement, and the 'revolutionary' Revolution 1 (a later version of the song featured as the b-side to Hey Jude is the most famous version for it's hard rocking vibe), McCartney's self-analyzing Blackbird, biographical Mother Nature's Son, and the dreamy Martha My Dear, and Harrison's beautiful While My Guitar Gently Weeps (which features Eric Clapton on guitar); hysterical: Lennon's odd but cool Everybody's Got Something To Hide Except For Me And My Monkey, wierd but wonderful Happiness Is A Warm Gun, self and Beatles mocking Glass Onion, and adventurously bizarre Continuing Story Of Bungalow Bill, McCartney's fairy tale spagetti western Rocky Raccoon, bizarre Why Don't We Do It In The Road, and the 50's inspired Honey Pie, Harrison's blatant criticism of the upper class Piggies, and Ringo's joyful Don't Pass Me By; to the hard rocking: Lennon's bluesy Yer Blues, McCartney's vicious Helter Skelter, and poppy Back In The USSR. <br /> <br />The White Album remains to be one of the best rock albums ever made. <br /> <br />Recommended <br /> <br />A
B000B5XOYI|4.0|Being a big batman fan I had to get this set. Basically I only like the first two movies. The other two weren't that great. Val Kilmer wasn't that bad as batman but it just wasn't that dark. When it all comes down on who plays a better batman, its Christian Bale. Yeah I said it. Michel Keaton wasn't that bad as batman in fact when it comes to it he' probably better than Clooney and Kilmer. But at the same time it kind of dosn't convince you that he could beat somebodys a$$.But the guy that said that the Batman movies should be like the spider movies. Well the last two should of but not the first two. They actually had some thought of having the director that made the spiderman movies do one of those batman movies. I don't care about the spiderman movies much but man Batman forever and Batman and robin would of been alot better. Anyway get this boxset if your a diehard batman fan. But if you only liked the first two or the last two then buy them seperate.
B00006CXSS|5.0|besides saving private ryan,we were soldiers,blackhawk down,sink the bismark,battle of the bulge & so on this one of the best i've seen!some people say it isn't the whole real story compared to the history channel version but it seems real enough especially with the officers in the beginning of each episode.
B000AU9UYM|5.0|When this movie came out I couldn't wait to see it. And man did this movie did not disapoint. Christian Bale playing Batman is one of the best Batmans ever.Dare I say, probably the best batman of all time. Now I wasn't to sure of how Katie Holmes would of been in this movie but she wasn't all that bad. Great acting and great effects too. The movie is more darker than the first movies and has more of a story of why Bruce Wayne became the dark night. He goes through training and learns the diffrence between justice and vengence. With a corrupt city it's up to Bruce to find a symbol. One that will put fear into the criminls and with the help of Sgt. Gorden(he isn't commisoner yet), Lucius Fox, and his helpful butler Alfred, to save Gothom from the corrupt. But it won't be easy as criminals like Carmine Falcone, Scarecrow,and the man that helped Bruce to become what he was Ras Al Ghul who wants to destroy Gothom with the help of his League of Shadows. Great movie overall and great action. It's one of my favorite movies and if your a batman fan or not, you won't be dissapointed.

B000ASATYO|4.0|I'm not going to restate what all the other reviewers have said so far about the story, the film's release history and so forth.  That would be redundant.  In short, this is an enjoyable comedy thriller and an excellent addition to any ghost enthusiast's film  vault.  Being an amateur ghost investigator myself (and living with a resident friendly spirit in my home), I like the movie for some of the factual elements.  But there are a LOT of cartoony effects done by the spirits that are totally impossible for real spirit to actually accomplish, least even think about doing in the first place.  For me, those elements hurt the story.  I rather see the ghosts in a more realistic light.  Take, for instance, the decayed state of their energy bodies.  This is stupid.  They would look as they did before death, though now in perfect form.  And what's with the whole deflated spiritual form thing when the Reaper takes their essence?  The spirit body IS the essence.  If the ethereal blade were to slice them, nothing would happen.  It would be like passing a knife through smoke.  There would be a second or two of gap, then the cloud would come together again.  Anyway, I could go on and on about the ghostly errors in the film, but that isn't the point here.  Ignoring them, this is a fun thriller ride with great comedic bits.  The best part of the DVD is the 3 hour and 43 minute (not 45) documentary taken straight from the original laserdisc.  A newly thin Jackson gives a quick introduction to the docu, then you can either watch the whole thing from beginning to end or skip to desired chapters.  This docu is a plethora of interesting making-of information, on scale to that of those found in the LOTR Trilogy Extended Edition box sets.  If you love ghosts like I do, this is a must have for your movie collection.
0440211727|3.0|Two Mississippi white men kidnap and rape a ten-year-old black girl. Her father, Carl Lee, blows them away before their trial. Jack, a local lawyer, seeks to defend Carl Lee from receiving the death penalty for his crimes. <br /> <br />This was John Grisham's first novel (although The Firm was mass-published first, and this one was later re-released), and - as he recognizes in his author's note at the beginning - it shows. He starts some plot lines that aren't well tied-up, sometimes he introduces information without enough background, and occasionally his descriptions are painfully detailed. <br /> <br />Despite all that, I couldn't put the book down. Grisham introduces interesting questions about all that goes into a judicial decision beyond the simple facts about the guilt or innocence of the accused. In this trial, the defendant is clearly guilty and yet, the question of whether he'll be convicted is unsettled. Grisham brings up the question of whether vigilante justice is ever justified. (Another book that explores that question in an interesting way is Frank Miller's \\"Batman: The Dark Knight Returns.\\")  <br /> <br />I've read only one other Grisham novel (The Street Lawyer), and this was Much Better than that one. It's a thrilling ride, even though it feels like it could have been better.
B0006M4SO6|5.0|I'm not a church person, nor am I even approaching what you would describe as a religious person. I just feel this way when listening to this music. A bit about my background, I am not a musician, I listened to all music out there progressively, I got to Pat Metheny before I started listening to Mozart and C.P.E. Bach, now I listen mostly to psychodelic trance when I work, helps me work for hours and hours. When I first started listening to classical music, and Mozart in particular, it was hard. I had to force myself, the music was hard to understand sometimes and not possible to reproduce inside my head at first. After a while I got used to it and would listen to Mozart and C.P.E. Bach and many other classical composers, 24/7 non-stop, on my 200 CD changer. All those years I would also listen to Pat Metheny's recordings. Few years ago I discovered psychodelic trance, \\"Hallucinogen\\" is the classic to get started on, if you are interested. I would listen now, non-stop to psychodelic trance, mainly because I started working at home, developing websites and I would basically work all the time other than meals and sleep. Psychodelic trance is great for listening while working, helps me focus and remain focused on my work, basically after few years working on my web framework, I have about 500,000 lines of code in my head. Anyway, back to Pat's \\"The way up\\". This recording is very complex, I welcomed the fact that I had to listen to it twice before I could start following the entire composition, much like \\"Mozart effect\\", Pat's composition/storyline is very complex and hard to follow at first. On a third listen I got a serious feeling of euphoria, that lasted the entire record. After few more listening sessions (I hope this will fly here) It kind of feels like a non-stop mental \\"orgasm\\". I can't help but to move my body to the  melodies and rhythms in the composition, my hands start moving much like director's hands in front of the orchestra. It's amazing, I've never experienced anything like it. This certainly is beyond my favorite now.... The whole recording may be too overwhelming to some at first, and too complex to understand, if you reach the point that you can understand the entire recording, I have to tell you there is nothing like it, that I ever heard. That's why I said it's \\"One step closer to God\\"! However, this is just one step closer, and I hope with my whole heart, that Pat continues and takes the next step, and the next, and the next... I can't wait! To give you another comparison with another one of my Pat's favorites, \\"Are you going with me\\", this composition is a wonderful story, I can listen to it over and over, and I have more than 10 versions of it from official records and from bootleg recordings, and can never get tired. However in comparison with \\"The Way Up\\", it's just a neat composition, that pales in comparison. It kind of seems one dimensional in comparison, with so many layers and completeness in the \\"The Way Up\\". I also must admit that I gave up on trying to understand \\"song X\\", years ago. Now I can hear Pat referring to \\"song X\\", and from what I've read, simply \\"song X\\" is the precursor and \\"The Way Up\\" is a bit more easier to understand, continuation to \\"song X\\", at least for me, not being a musician, not even having that good of an ear. So I will try again to listen to \\"song X\\" and try to fully understand it as well. This is just my opinion, I could not stop myself from expressing it, I am not a musician, nor a pro reviewer, so forgive the coarse language... I hope someone will reach for this recording and experience it fully, as a result. =)
B000BW7QWW|3.0|I wasn't a Joss Whedon fan, nor did I ever watch Buffy, so perhaps I'm missing something.  But I did sit down and watch the Firefly episodes on DVD right before watching the movie on DVD.<br /><br />The series was WONDERFUL.  It's a goofy premise -- a Western set in space -- but who cared?  The ensemble was terrific and the best part of every episode was learning more about a crew of folks, each one of which had a great story to tell.<br /><br />The movie?  Hmmm.  It was clearly a MOVIE rather than a TV show -- its visual scape was wider and richer -- and I wonder if that got Whedon in trouble.  They could have put these guys into a painted refrigerator box and the interaction would still have been fun; having more money for effects seemed to, again, distract.  (Whedon's not the only one this happens to -- look at the original three Star Wars movies before and after Lucas \\"improved\\" the effects.)<br /><br />SPOILERS FOLLOW...<br /><br />So what was the movie?  Basically a long version of what could have been a single episode.  So what happened?<br /><br />1) It was basically a \\"River\\" episode.  I don't have a problem with that, although I admit that I found her irritating throughout the series.  But that meant that...<br /><br />2) They spent what, an hour and a half on River?  I'd read that the movie would \\"answer the questions\\" about Firefly.  What was Preacher's story?  No idea.  We never DID get the backstory on him, and he got about five minutes on the air, none of which were really of any story value.<br /><br />3) Expanding on that... it seemed that Inara (I may be mis-spelling that), Wash and even Kaylie got a fairly small amount of time.  With all of the time in a feature film, was there no space to give each wonderful character a little time in the limelight?  Sure, the Rayne character got to display his caricature of a beer-drinking boob, but that's easy to write and not challenging to act.<br /><br />4) Apparently Whedon wanted to make sure that he didn't have to do any more movies, because he kills off Wash and Preacher in an off-handed manner.<br /><br />5) Finally, it felt eerily familiar.  Re-watch \\"Objects in Space\\" and you'll find yourself thinking \\"hmmm, was this the beta for the movie?\\"<br /><br />6) Okay, it was a small point, but where was the opening theme?  It was short, lyrical, and sort of poignant.  Whedon says that he wrote it BEFORE he even sketched out the show.  It deserved at least a play in the ending credits.<br /><br />Ah well; good SF shows often become bad movies.  But sometimes they become bad FIRST movies and much better second, third, etc movies.  Too bad this one won't get that chance.<br /><br />But perhaps I'm being too harsh.  This movie was still better any day than fifty blow-stuff-up, cop-buddy-car-chase movies.r /> <br />4) Apparently Whedon wanted to make sure that he didn't have to do any more movies, because he kills off Wash and Preacher in an off-handed manner.   <br /> <br />5) Finally, it felt eerily familiar.

B000BTC5LW|5.0|I waited for another DVD to be released and the same thing happened , same date , it was finally released after a couple months...I imagine Amazon does this rather than list a date that may not be absolute ( blame the record/DVD companies )...anyway , it is well worth the wait , I have waited over 5 years to see this PINK FLOYD PULSE release in DVD format , best concert on video I have ever seen....
B00000293E|4.0|The early 1970's saw the ending of sorts of the rock n roll bluesmakers so influenced by the great sides released by the Chicago Bluesmen of the 1960's..hence if Willie Dixon got some notoriety for his efforts as the fulcrum at this late stage of the game with this fine release of songs done his way not as his \\"sons\\" such as Muddy Waters.Howlin' Wolf and others did them then so be it...A fitting tribute doing these songs his way.<br /><br />Nice to hear the man wailing on his tracks made popular by the likes of Doors,Led Zeppekin,Cream,Jeff Beck,Stones etc....of course his Chess Box is a must..he was the \\"brains\\" in more ways than one.<br /><br />The sound is good and typical the style of Chess blues.
0060934913|5.0|Having dabbled in the oftentimes chaotic world that is the restaurant business I could barely finish reading a sentence because of the tears in my eyes from laughing till I cried!!  Tony really tells it like it is from working the required summer job at a seafood spot on the cape to his numerous culinary (mis)adventures in the Big Apple.  Everything he says about the life of line cook is so true to form I felt as if I was actually back on my old fry station trying to block out the screams of servers asking for items \\"on the fly\\".  I recommend this book to anyone who's tried their hand at the service industry or who just enjoys an often irreverent and sometimes disgusting accout of how the food you eat at your local \\"La Spoon De Grease\\" gets to your table.  Absolutely hilarious!!! Kudos Mr. Bourdaine. Kudos!!
B000BMSTMS|1.0|Anyone who rated above 1 star for this korn cd are either sell outs or do not know what korn is all about. Luckily I did not buy the cd and got a burn version instead, because it would have been a waste of money! Not one track on this album is even close to what Korn used to be. Look at Korn's 1st debut album. Heavy and one of the best albums I have ever heard! Korn sure has slipped down but all thier cd's except for this one has been still heavy! This cd is sure a sell out to all korn fans and a big dissapoinment. How in concert can you go from \\"Blind\\" to a dance pop song like \\"Twisted Transistor?\\" I listened to this cd five times already and cannot get into more then three songs! I try but instead turn it off because I feel like I am listening to KMFDM or a lame version of nine inch nails. I played a couple tracks for my friend and did not know who it was and he is a big korn fan! Korn need to go back to basics and stop being sell outs like most bands out there today (Metallica for a good example) They should stick to their own sound like SYSTEM OF A DOWN. You do not think that band would go techno and forget playing guitar? Do not buy this album!
0307276902|5.0|James Frey does an excellent job of describing time in rehab and of getting off drugs. Much of which is spent having breakfast and then a meeting and then lunch and then a meeting and then dinner and so on... This is the life of the addict in the early stages of recovery: learn to live the average life. It's not very entertaining. Imagine going from chaos to normalacy. James Frey does a wonderful job of reliving this for us and I am happy that a book like this exists.
B00081U6EG|3.0|Despite what others say I greatly enjoyed this DVD despite the obvious lack of key people. As mentioned, Gilmore and Paul Rogers are in particularly fine form (even though I'm so used to the magnificent version of \\"Sorrow\\" off Floyd's \\"Delicate Sound of Thunder\\" VHS - WHERE'S THAT DVD?!?!? - that this one took a little getting used to). And Gary Moore does a blistering cover of Hendrix's \\"Red House\\"!! Darn near peeled the paint off my walls!! One of the best performances I've ever seen by him. And his voice is much better that on his Monsters of Rock DVD. (He must have been near the end of a tour when they filmed that one!!) Yes It's missing some key people (Blackmore, Beck, Clapton & others.) And to you Malmsteen fans - sorry but why watch a Blackmore clone when you can watch the real thing!! And I already have DVDs by everyone that's missing so I say just enjoy who's there. But I also agree with the \\"Why England? Why not America?<br /><br />Despite other reviews I feel that this is a must DVD for all guitarists and fans of electric guitar.

0140177396|4.0|Ahhh, literature, that type of thing that is good and great but then is forced to be read in a high school classroom and thus ruins it for everybody...<br /><br />No, indeed, this book is really great.  What I find most compelling about it is that Steinbeck has not only a great understanding of who his characters are, he has a lot of sympathy for all of them, even the unsympathetic ones like Curley and his wife.  All told, this is a loving, caring shoutout to those lost individuals who found themselves in the era with no real property and no real future, which back then did not make them men.<br /><br />I reread this recently after several years, remembering I had read it in high school, and I must say I enjoyed it much more the second time around, being able to just immerse in the story and allow Steinbeck's rich imagery to flow without picking it apart.  Hopefully more people use this approach, because it deserves at least a first reading on its own terms and not an instructor's.<br /><br />--PolarisDiB
B000BO0LLS|5.0|mariah mariah people so so don't like you. what are we gonna do!!!!!!!nothing because they are just jealous of your looks your voice and the whole darn package!!!!!!! you've got everything!!!!!! her voice and music videos are incredible!!!! she is not fattttttt people! her looks are perfect her voice is perfect!!!!! need I say more!!!! go buy this and everything of her. and enough with all the haters. holla!!!!!!!!!! southern hottie!!!!
B00000JY1X|5.0|This is all very lo-fi indeed...all the arrangements are very basic, even tinny at times, and Stephin Merritt's voice is probably an acquired taste (it brings to mind the formulation Leo Kottke came up with to describe his own voice: geese farts on a muggy day)...but still, this sprawling collection of songs on the many varieties of love, from smooth to crunchy, works impossibly well...some are cynical, many are deeply moving, but even the throwaways stick in the memory...    They're all great and there're too many highlights to list here, but my personal favorites (at least today) from the set are: \\"Papa Was a Rodeo\\", \\"The Sun Goes Down...\\", \\"I Don't Believe in the Sun\\", and \\"I Don't Want to Get Over You\\"....    Yes, easily one of the best of the '90's.
B0006399FS|5.0|Check your hearing, naysayers, this album just plain RULES !!!!! The only thing I hate about it is that I probably won't get to see the tour (DVD comes close, but doesn't really count). For those of you who are disappointed that this isn't Boy, War or Joshua Tree part 2, might I submit that you wouldn't want them to put out the same album over & over. For that, I recommend AC/DC or the Ramones (both great bands, not much variety though).  U2's last 2 releases (this and All That You Can't Leave Behind) are by far their best, and I could argue all day about it, though I'd rather do it in a bar over several pints of Heineken as opposed to cyberspace. Suffice it to say that at least U2 tries different things, and always comes up with interesting results musically.  I say we should count our blessings.
B0009R1T7M|5.0|This, I believe the 2nd in Sufjan's promised series of albums about states (we're gonna hold you to it, Mr. Stevens!), is a stunner. Beautiful, everything-but-the-kitchen-sink arrangements, with an amazing array of meditations on \\"feeling the Illinoise\\", with themes ranging from Gacy to Carl Sandburg....This nearly indescribable and unique song cycle ranks high among the year's best...
B000BC8TBE|1.0|First off, I wish they had released this in a CD-only format as well, because I'm strongly against double-sided discs. But the REAL issue here is--they should have EXPANDED this release further and made it WORTH the purchase. Why isn't the remix of \\"All I Want For Christmas\\" from Mariah's Greatest Hits CD on here, where it actually belongs? And what about the three EXTREMELY rare, long club mixes of \\"Joy to the World\\", including a David Morales mix? Not to mention, while \\"God Rest Ye\\" is a brilliant acapella rendition, it's only 1 minute and 15 seconds, and the remix of \\"Santa Claus is Comin to town\\" is only 2 minutes and 40 seconds--leaving almost 40 minutes of unused space on the disc.<br /><br />I'm tired of record companies cheating us on what should have been worthy re-issues.<br /><br />Of course...I still got this to be a Mariah completist...just call me sucker.<br /><br />And any true fans of Mariah should hunt down that CD single of \\"Joy to the World\\". The only time I've ever seen it was once in the Tower Records in New York City years ago--the day I bought it, not even knowing it existed before stumbling upon it. It's not even listed here on Amazon.
B000B0WODA|4.0|FF are one of the real-deal alterna-finds of the last couple of years, and this, their sophomore release, suffers from no slump of any kind...they've managed to handily retain the momentum of their first rockin' release...Something about 'em, too, seems real, authentic -they really mean it, man. Unlike some of the other current charttopping alternative bands that harken back to sounds of the '80's: we all know who they are - the Killers, Interpol. You can tell with them that it's just a pose, a persona they're temporarily donning, till they go back to doing ska, or whatever... <br /> <br />FF, somehow are completely real, and though they echo certain great sounds of the 80's (70's too), like Gang of Four, Talking Heads, they succeed in being, at the same time, completely original and fresh... <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
0393317552|4.0|Taken as a whole, this book is definitely a very interesting read.  Although not necesarily a completely original thesis, Diamnod succeedes in clearly and methodically proving the general idea that disparities in the development of different societies are laregly due to geography and environment.  I believed I had a thorough understanding of why history unfolded the way it did but Diamond truly amazed me at various points.  I also found the book interesting in its stripping down of history to the most general trends.   <br /> <br />On the other hand, one criticism I have, as others have mentioned, is Diamond's complete disregard for any sort of religious or cultural influences on development.  I found this hard to agree with.  It seems obvious that the very \\"individual-centered\\" Christian religion of the Europeans which called for man to \\"subdue nature\\" had profound effects on why the Europeans decided to conquer whole continents.  On the other had, the religion of most native americans, which revered \\"mother earth\\" and sought to live in harmony with nature rather than dominate it, had equally important an impact on why the indians remained a relatively \\"primitive\\" society.  Also, the book was at least 100-200 pages too long.  At points it is very redudant and sometimes I felt like the entire book could be perfectly grasped in 100 pages.  Overall, though, a very interesting book worth the time.
B000BW7QWW|4.0|Why is this so great, and why are all the recent Stah Wahs flicks so lame? It's all in the characters, Mistah Lucas...all the relationships are so carefully delineated in \\"Serenity\\", that you actually care what happens to all the denizens of the old junker firefly...that, capped with great dialogue, thrilling action and stunts and plot elements that don't all center around board meetings, makes for some mighty thrilling, whiz bang entertainment!
B00004RITP|5.0|This Mahler 10 IMHO says it all, and more eloquently and more eminently than all others maybe. Whatever your reservations about a 'score unfinished', this recording, I believe, completely convinces one again and again of the greatness of this ('unfinished') music AS PERFORMED HERE.<br /><br />The performance in my ears sounds more 'raw' and with more 'attack' than any other recording of this music, the result of Sir Simon Rattle's tendency to make the most of all the many contrasts and sudden tempo changes, and to make every instrumental sound stand out in the orchestral soundpicture as clearly as possible. Fire and ice. Although this could also be caused by the rather direct and clear, but somewhat thin recording as such. With this specific music, this 'thinness' of sound is in my idea not a big problem, or rather an advantage. (Thinness of sound IS a problem with Sir Simon Rattle's Mahler 8, though!). But I must hasten to say that the whole aural range - from soaring and piercing highs to rumbling lows - is captured in an astoundingly sharp and beautifully natural way.<br /><br />Compared with other recordings of Mahler's Tenth Symphony (many of which are different 'versions', but I would like to stick with the 'performing version' by Deryck Cooke et al here for convenience sake), like Inbal or Chailly, I like this one the best. At least it is the most convincing performance - the conductor wresting each and every possible emotion from all of the notes - that I have ever heard. This must be the most 'highly charged' (emotionally as well as purely musical) performance - combined with some of the most disciplined playing - ever recorded. There are more 'beautiful' performances maybe (take for example Inbal), but those are generally a little(?) more laid back and relaxed. This is of course the result of different, equally legitimate visions of different conductors, suiting many tastes or moods ... if such could be possible in this very explicit music: a final shout of rage and ultimately desperation at the dying of the light. Anyhow, this Mahler 10 does have the most TERRIFYING A-flat minor (Mahler's 'tragic' key) chorale (just before the infamous nine-tone chord-outburst - beyond any 'key') I have ever experienced, and I find it most unsettling to listen to. Its horror is so devastating I must really brace myself emotionally every time.<br /><br />If you are drawn to this music - which is probably irrevocable - you really should have this recording. (And while the sound of the standard stereo CD is just fine, I can say that the high-resolution stereo of the audio-DVD version of this recording is even clearer and generally better and absolutely captivating. Unfortunately I am not able to listen to this recording in its six-channel Surround Sound format, so I could not comment on that, but I can only expect it would offer a truly overwhelmingly emotional experience.) Actually this shattering Mahler 10 IMHO deserves no less than six *stars*.d ultimately desperation at the dying of the light.

B000B7HZXM|1.0|While 75% of the blame for this musical atrocity must be placed squarely on the shoulders of Rod Stewart, a musician I once admired for his passionate performances of such songs as Maggie May and You Wear It Well, and for being the dynamic lead singer of such fine British blues rock bands as the Faces and the Jeff Beck Group, at least 25% of the blame belongs to those who contributed to this. Let's name them, as it will be easier to tar and feather them: Chris Botti, Diana Ross (she's always valued ego over music), Chaka Kahn (it's been a long time since the glory days of Rufus), Elton John (an increasingly irrelevant force in music, living off his past glory), Dave Koz, George Benson, Roy Hargrove, Kenny Ascher, Ed Howard, Allan Schwartzberg, David Finck, Dan Higgins, and Warren Luening. And last but certainly not least producer Clive Davis.<br /><br />Put simply, Rod Stewart's voice is all wrong for this kind of material. While there is nothing necessarily wrong with a musician (or anyone else) mellowing with age, there is good mellow. And there is bad, cheesy mellow. And this has aged not unlike a container of milk that's been sitting in the fridge a bit too long. This is curdled milk, disgusting to sniff and risky to drink. In other words, yuck!
B000ASATWQ|5.0|This is a HOT cd... Very Hot... Very Unique... Damian does not travel a straight line when it comes to the raggae on this cd.  He ventures out, which is much admired!  Especially on the Track \\"Beautiful\\" with Bobby Brown, awesome duo!!! I like that he is creative and he varies with his vocal approaches.  He's not trying to prove he's a Marley or capitalize off the fact that he's from Jamaica, he's just trying to display his talents, have fun, and give us a quality CD... which he most definitely did.  I look forward to his next release and this should DEFINITELY be on GRAMMY lists for Best Raggae 2005. Awesome CD, very enjoyable, very impressive. No longer in his fathers shadow, I feel Damian is definitely setting a strong foundation for himself as an indivual carrying on a strong musical legacy.
B00097DXZS|2.0|This recording, featuring a number music biz pros, (some of them being fairly talented folks) is, ultimately, a soulless bore.<br /><br />For those who wish to see what Carlos Santana is capable of, you should check him out in the film of, or on the soundtrack to, \\"Woodstock\\" wherein he and his band deliver a scorching rendition of the song Soul Sacrifice. Then, listen to this. The comparison will make the differences between what Santana once was and what Santana now is completely obvious. It's like the difference between a full course Thanksgiving dinner lovingly prepared by your mom vs. a Swanson frozen turkey dinner. Both are turkey dinners, but I know which one I prefer. Obviously, Mr. Santana is now in the business of simply cranking out a mere product. Having had chart topping success a few years ago working with the Matchbox 20 singer, he now tries to duplicate the same formula. But here, he's thrown in everying but the kitchen sink, hoping something will work. It doesn't.<br /><br />I have a suggestion for you Carlos. You are still a gifted guitarist, but your music is now pointless. Why not assemble a real band, for a change, one worthy of the name Santana. And while you are at it, can you, or somebody, get Clive Davis to retire from the music industry.
B00006CXSS|5.0|I'm a big film and documentary buff - have thousands of DVDs (close to 6,000) in my collection.  Hey, when you live in Ohio and winter hits, watching movies is the only way to avoid getting depressed!  This is an amazing movie that is certainly worth watching not once, but over and over again.  I am careful when I make a DVD purchase - I only buy movies that I am sure that I and my family will enjoy multiple times due to the cost of the film.  When Band of Brothers first came out on DVD, and I had seen most of it on HBO previously, so without hesitation I bought it.  This is first rate storytelling.<br /><br />I am a big fan of WW II movies and follow details regarding accuracy closely.  From all that I have read regarding this most-important event of the 20th century, this film nailed the accuracy issue in all regards.  It was fast moving.  At no point did it cause me to look at my watch (which I often do when watching movies to tell the truth!).  In fact, for 90% of all of the DVDs in the set I was on the edge of my seat - no kidding!<br /><br />Someone on this site has already pointed out, very patiently and helpfully, the content of the story so I won't bother doing that.  But suffice it to say, that as someone who is much more critical than your average viewer of movies and DVDs - I was blown away by this one.<br /><br />Also, I have a movie crisicism group that meets each month at my house (I have a high-end movie theater in my basement).  This film has made it onto the list of what we will be watching in 06 - that's saying a lot.  This group is made up of a dozen similar-minded critical viewers as me.  We certainly don't watch just anything that comes along.  After watching the movie we discuss the film at length, the production elements, the actors' other films, the quality of the camera work, etc.  If a film can make it to the list of this critical group, that's quite a compliment.
0553801503|2.0|I loved the first three books in this series and was eager to buy this volume.  Fortunately I read the reviews on this site and saved my money. This was a good thing, because I borrowed the book from the library and was truly disgusted. George Martin is a terrific writer. There is no excuse for this tedious drivel. It is clearly an attempt to make more money by drawing out a story to fit two books.
B00005R23S|5.0|I am a concert fanatic.I have seen almost all the classic groups.No one creates a party atmosphere and jams like Prince.No one transforms  you like Bruce.I have seen him in 70s,80s,90,2000s.2000 was his best tour ever.Why?The enthusiasm,happiness of being back together with his boyhood friends.His previous concerts were a rock and roll experience.On this tour it is a rock and roll.religious,gospel.life experience.The three long songs-tenth avenue,light of day,this train are the most incredible ever.Bruce and u2 are the greatest groups that take you along with them on the meaning of life.Bruce is number 1.The greatest concert dvds for me are- meatloaf in australia,talking heads-making sense,prince-sign of times,u2-elevation,petergabriel-secret world.
B000007XUQ|2.0|I have a collection of at least 30 different Christmas albums that I have bought over the years; everything from Frank Sinatra to the Macarena Christmas (ugh) and everything in between.  While many of these albums/CDs are wonderful, nothing in my mind compares with the album put together by The Carpenters.  Karen Carpenter sings like an angel and will make every hair stand up on your body and bring tears to your eyes with her versions of Ave Maria, I'll be Home for Christmas, Silent Night and more.  Her brother, Richard, plays the piano throughout and his music is wonderful.      Everyone that I know who owns this collection says the same thing.  This is simply the best Christmas Album Ever.  I cannot recommend The Carpenters Christmas Collection more highly.  If you don't have it, get it today.  It's too bad Karen, that angel, was taken from us at such a young age.

B00007BK2N|4.0|This film is very good if you are into Factory as a whole.  If you are watching it just for one band, don't.  You will find yourself disappointed.
B00000K2W1|5.0|This is a a great introduction to the late, great Ms. Janis Joplin.  For those of you who haven't had the great pleasure of listening to her mesmerizing music, this is an essential album for your collection.  This is a timeless retrospective of some of her best work.<br /><br />What can I say about Janis Joplin that hasn't been said before?  Well, there probably isn't much.  She is one of the most important and originaly singers of the 1960s who was taken from us WAY too young.  But, as heroin and her hard and fast life took her from this earth, she left a collection of beautiful, unforgettable songs that live on in the hearts and minds of her numerous fans.  They include:  \\"Piece of My Heart,\\" \\"Summertime,\\" and \\"Me and Bobby Magee,\\" among others.  Never has wailing, moaning and bellowing sounded more melodious. Joplin didn't merely sing these songs.  She lived them.  In the documentary, \\"Janis,\\" she compared singing her songs, in front of a live audience, to the high one gets when making love.  You can hear that rush as she builds in her intensity and expression in each of the songs in this Greatest Hits collection.  Amazing and ageless.....
0684824906|5.0|Doris Kearns deserves five stars for writing this excellent book about Abraham Lincoln and the men who served in his cabinet.  Abraham Lincoln has been much mythologized by historians and folk lore over the years.  The reality is somewhat different than the folklore.  For starters, Abraham Lincoln was an incredibly shrewd politician.  He had almost no chance of capturing the Republican nomination for President in 1860, but did so through very skillful maneuvering. At the time of his election to President, Lincoln held no elective office. <br /> <br />In the book, we learn of people who were bare footnotes in history textbooks.  There is William Seward, a former senator and governor of New York who campaigns against Lincoln for the Republican Presidential nomination and loses a hard fought contest at the convention. Yet, due to Lincoln's adept manner at dealing with people, he becomes his closest confidant and Secretary of State during the Civil War.  There is Salmon Chase who also lost the nomination for President to Lincoln.  Chase is an incredibly ambitious and even arrogant man.  Yet, Lincoln realizes his brilliance and makes him Secretary of the Treasury.  He bends over backwards to be fair to Chase, even though its evident Chase is undermining him and wants Lincoln's job.  There is Edward Bates of Missouri, who Lincoln appoints Attorney General.  Bates was an admirable character who was a slave-owner, but was willing to give up all his slaves for the sake of maintaining the Union. <br /> <br />Lincoln had no idea when his presidency began that the \\"Rebellion\\" by southern states would turn into a protracted civil war that would cost 600,000 lives.  He made the mistake of thinking that after a battle or two the Confederacy would give up.  Sadly, he was mistaken and he and his cabinet officers had to \\"dig in\\" and learn the hard way how to fight a bloody, four-year civil war.  At times, the cause of the Union appeared lost. The British and European powers came close to diplomatic recognition of the Confederacy, but than backed away.  Lincoln had a very difficult time finding a general who was willing to fight the south.  The book recounts his struggles with McClellan, Burnside, Hooker, and Meade before he finally picked the right man, Ulysses Grant. <br /> <br />There are historical lessons to be learned from Lincoln's behavior both before he became President and after.  First, a brilliant person can overcome great odds with enough effort and if his timing is right.  Second, a person who understands human nature--as Lincoln did--can work marvels at dealing with bitter enemies and opponents.  Third, sometimes one must be patient even in the most trying of circumstances.  Fourth, obtaining consensus is critical to success in politics.  In this sense, the book is less about history or the Civil War than it is a lesson in dealing with people and politics. <br /> <br />I could not recommend this book more highly.
6302212529|5.0|You know I couldn't write reviews of almost every other film I have seen, and leave this one out!  I remember the day I saw this film for the first time, when I was about seven years old.  It was one of those films you never forget. I had the great fortune to see \\"The Little Mermaid\\" in the theatre (which is how it SHOULD be seen).  Not only is the animation spectacular and absolutely stunning (this was before the introduction to computer animation, that is so widely used today), but the actors providing the voices for the characters are wonderful.<br /><br />Ariel (voice of Jodi Benson) is a beautiful, headstrong 16 year old mermaid who wants nothing more but to live with the land dwellers and be a \\"Part of their world\\" (to paraphrase on of the most well known songs from the film).  Her father, King Triton  (Kenneth Mars), knows all too well the stark reality of the fish eating, two legged creatures and doesn't want his daughter to experience the pain of being an outsider, nor does he want her to put herself in harm's way.  Nothing will stop Ariel when she experiences love at first sight, after rescuing a very handsome young prince from near-fatal drowning.<br /><br />I won't get long winded on you, as far as plot details are concerned.  All I am going to say is this......this is a MUST SEE.  \\"The Little Mermaid\\" can be enjoyed by people of all generations, and will leave you with memorable tunes, a song in your heart and a smile on your lips.  *two BIG thumbs up*
B0000041Q3|5.0|If when you are listening to opera and you want the speakers to vibrate, the buy this opera! Pavarotti and Sutherland hurl their voices so strongly, that it's any wonder their careers lasted as long as they did. The orchestra is vibrant and powerful. Caballe in her Act 1 aria is sublime. Sutherland is wonderful and exquisite in her first aria, mixing the beautiful and the dread, with an air of regality, accurately depicting the role of the icy and proud Princess Turandot. And if you are a true opera lover, then Pavarotti's role as the exiled prince Calaf will make your heart thump and yours ears feel satisfied, especially in the aria that he has made his signature tune-\\"Nesun Dorma\\".

B000BTJDGC|5.0|This is a very special movie, probably the first film ever to deal honestly with the subject of demonic possession from a purely Christian perspective without all the usual special effects. Based on a true 20th century account, 'The Exorcism of Emily Rose' chronicles the unfortunate tale of a young college girl who had the misfortune of being too sensitive and caring. Traits that apparently attract spiritual evil and can leave one vulnerable and susceptible to demonic attack and ultimately possession.    Are demons real and can one become possessed by the spirits of evil? The makers of this film think so. So do I.    Excellent performances by Laura Linney, Scott Campbell and of course Jennifer Carpenter as Emily Rose.
B0000WN0ZK|4.0|Director Michelangelo Antonioni leads us on a bizarre and artsy journey between the real and the imagined through the psychedelic scene of 1960's London.  David Hemmings who nicely plays disillusioned photographer Thomas, is taking a break from his hectic schedule.  Strolling through a local park with camera in hand he is casually taking pictures of sights and scenes.  He espies a couple in amorous embrace and innocently takes a series of photographs of them.  The woman, Jane played by Vanessa Redgrave is visibly upset and demands that Hemmings give her the photos.  He blows her off and leaves the park.<br /><br />Hemmings returns to his flat and studio and who should turn up but Redgrave.

He finds that the corpse is no longer there.  Did he actually witness a murder or were his mind and camera playing tricks on him?
B0007Y4TVU|4.0|well after hearing both of the double album i came 2 the conclusion that i like hypnotized just a little better. not to say this album isnt good, cause it is. im getting used to the gutarist singing. though his not better tham serj.this album is poppy but it has its heavyness to it. go get them both. hear them back 2 back.
B0007VZ9DK|1.0|I love this movie! However, the disc simply WILL NOT play when it gets to a certain point. I've become very frustrated with Universal and their crappy DVDs. Like a previous reviwer mentioned, BOYCOTT UNIVERSAL until they can fix this problem!!!!
B000BM6AVA|4.0|ive been a big fan of system since their first and best album. that said hypnotize was good. i liked it a little better than mezmerize. the only song i didnt like was, shes like heroin cause the guitarist singing is horrible in this song. the rest was kick ass. i love track 2 its my favorite. it was a little heavier than mezmerize and had some sounds of the first album. its my third fav system album. first album was just classic and so was tocixity.keep em coming.
B00001MXXH|4.0|Matthew Broderick was already a Broadway star and starred in a couple of hit movies but he was not a star.  But Ferris Bueller's Day Off made him a teen sensation. <br /> <br />Director / Writer John Hughes by this time perfected the high school movie.  Ferris (Broderick) is from an upper class family in Chicago.  Both his parents work and he has a sister.  Every so often, Ferris needs a day off from school.  Today is one of them.  But a day off alone is no fun.  Chances are his best friend (Alan Buck) is having one of his hypochondriac days and his father has a Porsche convertible.  That just leaves springing his girlfriend (Mia Sara), which of course Ferris does with ease.   <br /> <br />The only problem is the principal.  He wants to nail Ferris and his crew.  Of course in a John Hughes movie the heavy only gets humiliation. <br /> <br />The trio head out for a wild day in downtown Chicago.  The best parts are the Musuem of Art and the parade sequence. <br /> <br />This is not a deep film, it is a wildly entertaining film.  Broderick is charming and incorrigible as the hero and is the film.  It's a great Saturday afternoon film. <br /> <br />DVD EXTRAS: Commentary by John Hughes <br />

B00005JKGZ|5.0|Meet Me in St Louis is a year in the life of the Smith family.  It is divided into the four seasons -summer, fall, winter and spring.  The film is based on a series of New Yorker Magazine articles and the subsequent book by Sally Benson.  It takes place at a time where life was simpler and everyone had manners. <br /> <br />Liza Minnelli has a nice five  <br /> <br />SUMMER 1903 <br /> <br />We are introduced to Mrs. Smith - mama / Anna (Mary Astor) and Katie (Marjorie Main), the maid, making catsup.  One by one each of the family members arrive, only son Lonnie (Henry H Daniels, jr), third daughter Agnes (Joan Carroll), grandpa (Harry Davenport), middle child Ester (Judy Garland), oldest daughter Rose (Lucille Bremer), youngest daughter Tootie (Margaret O'Brien), and Mr. Smith - papa / Alonzo sr. (Leon Ames). <br /> <br />The newcomer is neighbor John Truitt (Tom Drake).  Ester has decided that she is going to marry him.  Rose has her own beau, Yale man Warren Sheffield.  Ester pines after John with the famous song \\"The Boy Next Door\\". <br /> <br />To get John and Ester together, Rose invites him to Lonnie's going away party (he's becoming a Princeton man).  The party has two great numbers, the ensemble piece Skip to My Lou and the Garland / O'Brien duet under the bamboo tree.  The party ends leaving Ester and John alone together.  This leads to one of the most romantic scenes ever.  Ester and John are turning out the gas lights.  The way Minnelli shot it showed his love for Garland.  The two never do anything more than shake hands but you can see the chemistry. <br /> <br />The next scene is probably the film's most famous.  The \\"youngsters\\" are going out to Fairground construction site on the trolley.  Everyone is there except for John Truitt.  Everyone sings the Oscar nominated The Trolley Song.  When Ester sees John, she joins in. <br /> <br />Autumn 1903 <br /> <br />This is Halloween night.  This is a wonderful sequence.  It shows how Halloween was celebratedat the turn of the century.  It is not the commercial event it is now. Kids would go to the houses of those they feared and throw flour in their face to \\"kill\\" them. Tootie takes on the most feared man in town. <br /> <br />Father announces that he has been made head of the New York office and the family will be moving after Christmas.  <br /> <br />Winter 1903 <br /> <br />Lonnie is home and he has a crush on Lucille Ballard (June Lockhart).  The big event is the Christmas Eve dance.  Since Lucille has snubbed Lonnie for Warren, Ester and Rose have decided to dominate all the men at the dance.  Disaster strikes when John's suit is locked in the tailor shop but grandpa comes to the rescue.  Of course, Lucille tells Warren to go with Rose and she will be with Lonnie.  This sticks Ester with Lucille's dance card from hell.   But of course John shows up in time for the last dance. <br /> <br />After the dance, the John asks Ester to marry him.  When she goes home, she finds Tootie waiting up for Santa Claus.  This leads to Ester singing the greatest Christmas song of all time, \\"Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas.\\"   <br /> <br />In the end, papa decides that the family will stay in St. Louis. Oh and Warren tells Rose they are getting married! <br /> <br />Spring 1904 <br /> <br />The Louisiana Purchase Exposition (World's Fair) is opening and everyone is going in their finest. <br /> <br />Many felt that Meet Me in St Louis was one of the best films of 1944.  Unfortunately it only received 4 Oscar Nominations (no wins).  I agree that it was best and should have been nominated for Best Picture, Judy should have been nominated for Best Actress and Vincent for Best Director. <br /> <br />It is well known that this is the film where Judy and Vincent met and fell in love.  You can see it in every scene.  This was a work of love. <br /> <br />DVD EXTRAS - <br />Disc 1: <br />Introduction by Liza Minnelli -  <br /> <br />Commentary by John Fricke with Margaret O'Brien, Irving Brecher, Hugh Martin and Babra Freed Saltzman <br /> <br />Music-only Track - This has the movie with only the musical score, no dialog or other  sounds including singing. <br /> <br />Disc 2: <br />Meet Me in St. Louis: Making of an American Classic - Roddy McDowell narrates the 30 minute documentary made in 1994.  It tells the origins of the film from the adaptation of the New Yorker Magazine articles to the casting and the making of film with new and vintage interviews with Margaret O'Brien, Lucille Bremer, Hugh Martin, Vincent Minelli, and Liza Minelli.  This has some interesting insights into the film.   <br /> <br />Hollywood: The Dream Factory - This 50 minute documentary made in 1972 is a history of MGM.  It is narrated by Dick Cavat.  It has obviously been put on the DVD as a filler.  It is nice but noting special.  The only fun thing is a sequence at the end where Elizabeth Taylor grows from Lassie to Father of the Bride to Cat on a Hot Tin Roof. <br /> <br />Becoming Attractions: Judy Garland - TCM's 46 minute compilation of Judy Garland film trailers hosted by film historian Robert Osborne.  If you are Judy fan this is fun to watch. <br /> <br />Meet Me in St. Louis TV pilot - The 1965 television pilot starring Shelly Fabares, Rita Shaw and Celeste Holm written by Sally Benson.  It was a typical 60's TV show - very hooky but any chance to see Celeste Holm is worth a one time look. What was interesting is that it was shot in color before color TV. <br /> <br />Bubbles - a 1930 Warner Bros short subject with Judy Garland (as part of the Gumm Sisters).  She appears for a couple of seconds about 2 minutes in to the short. These are always fun to see.   <br /> <br />Skip to My Lou - a 1941 short featuring songwriters Hugh Martin and Ralph Blane.  And the orchestration of the song will sound quite familiar! <br /> <br />Audio Vault - contains two items - Boys and Girls Like You and Me - Rogers and Hammerstein's song that was cut from the film.  A brief intro has been inserted and the song is performed over stills.   <br />12/02/46 Lux Radio Theater Broadcast - It was not uncommon to promote a movie to perform an abridged version of the film on the radio.  This features Judy, Margret and Tom and Gale Gordon as papa and contains the original commercials (running time 57 minutes).   <br /> <br />Stills gallery - assortment of stills from the movie and production. <br />
B000AP04L0|5.0|We recently organised a pot luck for our team an I selected this as gift. I sticked yellow note sticker all over the dvd case and left the words \\"WORK SUCKS\\" visible out side. when one of my co worker picked this gift and read read the sentence there was a big laugh in the room. and when he opened (removed the stickers) every one said it was the perfect gift with perfect packing for the occasion.<br /><br />Anyway movie is one of my favourite and must watch.
B000BM6AVA|4.0|\\"Hypnotize,\\" the second half of System of a Down's 2005 opus, is clearly a continuation of their first album, \\"Mezmerize\\" (which was released in May). In addition to not being very far removed musically from \\"Mezmerize,\\" this album also follows about the same blueprint. The songs on \\"Hypnotize\\" are very corky and energetic. It combines jokes with serious, bold political messages, and heavy songs (\\"Stealing Society\\") with slower, ballad-esque numbers (\\"Lonely Day\\"). Plus, many of the songs have several tempo changes. (\\"Dreaming\\" combines \\"Chop Suey\\"-esque singing with tempo changes that bring \\"B.Y.O.B.\\" to mind, and \\"U-Fig\\" and \\"Holy Mountains\\" are chaotic, off-the-wall tunes with whiplash speed changes and even acoustic guitar breakdowns.) And, finally, guitarist/songwriter Daron Malankian gets more time at the mic than he did on the band's first two albums. But most of his singing, here, is actually pretty good. (Track one, \\"Attack\\" begins with fast, ultra-crunchy riffs, before Daron begins to croon nasally, and he actually sounds as good as Serj.)<br /><br />There are some throw away tracks on here. \\"She's Like Heroin\\" goes absolutely no where, and \\"Vicinity of Obscenity\\" is so silly, it could be a \\"Steal This Album\\" b-side. But most of these songs are very good and there are a few mature moments (i.e. \\"Kill Rock `N Roll\\" and the title track), which sound more along the lines of a traditional System of a Down song.<br /><br />Upon my first listening to this album, I was not at all impressed. I thought System were trying too hard to be funny, but usually ended up coming across as goofy. Fortunately, however, I gave this disc repeated spins and it grew on me quite a lot. So I recommend you do the same; buy it, and give it time to sink under your skin (something it will most definitely do). It isn't a great C.D., but it's still quite good, and worth buying if you're a fairly big SOAD fan; if you're a casual fan, however, you will probably be satisfied with just one of System's five records.one of System's five records.
B0000074NU|4.0|UFO's legacy is a large one and this collection delivers.  A fine place to start and discover what all the hub bub is about. <br /> <br />After that, do get the live \\"Strangers In The Night\\" (Schenker at his UFO best)! <br /> <br />BTW, who's the bonehead that designed the cover.  Whoever it was, apparently didn't do their homework as there are two pictures of Pete Way and none of Paul Raymond.  You think the label would at least have somebody who is familiar with the band do the cover.  :(
B000BJS4TO|3.0|I haven't purchased my copy of this soundtrack (due to its unavailability here) but I'd like to share some thoughts...when I saw the trailer for memoirs of a geisha, the music was familiar and I remebered it was the EXACT music from the last samurai. So now I am wondering if the movie soundtrack of geisha and samurai are the same? I mean, I am not sure if the geisha trailer music is the same as the movie score. Can someone help me out? Thank you.

0393317552|5.0|I enjoyed reading this book. It begins with a question that takes several hundred pages to answer.  <br /> <br />The question is: how did some civilations end up to be the dominant while others simply faded away?  <br /> <br />The book serves to answer this question in depth, probing into topics such as: the biodiversity of both plant and animal species for a particular geographical area which affected the successful conversion of societies from hunting and gathering to food production and animal domestication.  <br />Other factors include orientation and geographies of large land masses, i.e. whether oriented longitudinal or latitudinal, or whether mountains or desert separate areas, which affected transfer of populations and/or technologies.  <br /> <br />All in all, a fascinating read and a high level view of the entire human history and if anything, you'll have a new appreciation of our world and become more and more global.
B000AYEIZY|3.0|Ok - it's ginger, jack and eric - the reunion you NEVER thought would happen. <br /> <br />Heck, it's pretty much the ONLY reunion that era that could happen since all the band members are still alive (well, ELP, but anyway). <br /> <br />well - they hit all the notes (even Jack's singing is still pretty good to great) but there's no FIRE in them. <br /> <br />Someone said \\"wow, they're playing TOGETHER for the first time\\". Maybe, but there's thousands of bands that could play those notes and sound just as good, I want FIRE from these guys - I want to hear them playing like it's a competitive sport! \\"Yeah, DIG THIS riff dude! In your FACE!!\\" If I want laid back I'll listen to clapton play these songs. There was a reason they said \\"Eric is god\\" in the 60s and Jack and Ginger could keep up with him. <br /> <br />Anyway, I'm glad I didn't shell out the THOUSANDS of dollars it would have taken to go see these guys - and I'm glad this was a present and I didn't shell out the 20$ for the CD. <br /> <br />Oh well....
069111966X|4.0|A really helpful book that goes way beyond math. In our hurry to get through algebra we almost completely sidestep problem solving in teaching. It's true that we have `story problems' but they're usually just applications that restate the chapter's contents. That's why so many people get to a class like physical chem in college and flounder: they've never really been taught how to solve a problem only to regurgitate what's been read. This book by Polya fills in that gap.<br /><br />More than that, though, this book is useful for life in general. Much of life is a leap from one decision to another and this book will help in looking at all problems and decision from new angles. (See Polya's book \\"Plausible Thinking\\" for lots more detail on this subject.)<br /><br />Like in his other books the author has a knack for making the difficult seem a whole lot easier but parts can still be heavy going. Well worth the trudge, though.
B000BW7QWW|5.0|Ok, let me start off by saying that Firefly, like all of Joss Whedon's shows, is quirky. Think of a marriage of concepts that is one part Star Wars, one part spaghetti western and one part seven samauri and you'd come close. Take that and add Whedon's incredible knack for having characters say and do all those little things you always wished TV/movie characters would say or do. In Firefly the magic worked and it worked well. Unfortunately, the very quirkiness that made the show click also made some people slow to give it a try, which is what (I think) lead to its early demise. Had it been given the same chance its sister show Buffy the Vampire Slayer had for the buzz to get out, I think it would have enjoyed similar success.  <br /> <br />Alas. <br /> <br />Serenity is a true successor to the TV show without FEELING like a TV show transferred to the big screen. It clicks on so many levels. It'll make you laugh out loud, cry, and rage. It's action-packed but also very dramtically compelling, building on character relationships as well as tackling questions we were teased with in the series. However, whether you have seen the series or not, there's something in here for any fan of science fiction. <br /> <br />There's a reason this show has such a cult following. Trust me, if you get a chance, see the show, follow it up with the movie. It's a ride you won't forget.
0393320928|5.0|I think it was Gell-Mann who said that there are two kinds of geniuses (I paraphrase): those who are just a whole lot smarter than we are and those who are magicians of the sort that we can't even imagine how they arrive at what they think. Feynman was certainly in the later camp.<br /><br />First - if you haven't read this book read it - it will become one of your favorites that you go to time and again.<br /><br />Second - purchase \\"Surely You're Joking Mr. Feynman\\" and do the same thing.<br /><br />Both books are the observations, stories, and pranks by one of this century's most brilliant scientist. Don't let the label `scientist' scare you if you don't like science. These essays are funny, witty, and extremely homey and readable. Feynman was certainly brilliant but he was also just the guy next door. The guy who used to do exotic physics on napkins down at the nudie bar.<br /><br />There is a large section of the book devoted to his participation in the downed space shuttle investigation that is both funny and informative. It's hard to beat this book for plain fun.
B0009HLDFU|5.0|This album just slapped me in the face! WOW!<br />I like to download first and kick the tires around before I buy something.  I thought I would give a listen to this album for kicks.  Damn! Maybe it's because I grew up in Seattle in the 80's, but this album kicks some serious ****ing ass.  It will make the giddy even giddier!<br />  The first disk blew me away with strong guitar play and a new refreshing raw sound that just grabs you and will not let go.  Disk two takes it down to a smooth more acoustic mellow sound that I just loved.  It has been a long time since I have listened to an album of this quality.  Foo Fighters hit the jackpot with this one.<br />  I never really listened to the Foo Fighters before, but gave them a try by downloading.  I'll tell you this....I'm going to get my crowbar out and open my wallet!  This is a must buy!  Yes, Disco Dave will be running down to his local music store for this one!
0393316041|5.0|I've loved this book since the first time I read it years ago. Every page is a gem and will make you laugh. There's no arguing over Feynman's intelligence but what strikes me most about his character was his unfailing curiosity. His natural language was the language of `why' and `what if.' He was also a practical joker that loved a good laugh. He also exhibited an almost complete disregard for authority. Not in the sense of being disrespectful but in the sense of not believing anything until he had proved it to himself. This book outlines in his own words some of his more hilarious (and sometimes serious) exploits.<br /><br />This will be one of the funniest and still intelligent books you will ever read.
B0006L16N8|3.0|I liked some of the earlier stuff; however, they really havn't matured as a band or developed musically.  This album could best be described as U2 with nothing really to sing about.<br />  I know that people that love the band will scoff at me.  Please don't kill the messenger.  I loved their earlier stuff.  I just think that this band is more talanted then X&Y.  I think this band needs to explore more with their music.  I would really like to hear this band play some more upbeat stuff.  I'm not a metalhead, but I think that this CD is a little to slow and i can't tell the difference between each song.<br />  To be fair, the rythm is good, but the album is a story that goes nowhere.<br />  In short, they need to do something new.  If you already have Rush of Blood to the Head and/or Parachutes, then there is no need to buy this album. Sorry, but that's the deal!

B000BJS4OY|1.0|How many times is \\"The Boss\\" going to re-package the same old songs.  Instead of trying to come up with ways to sell us the same songs year after year, he should try writing some new ones, or maybe even a entire album worth anything.
0061020710|5.0|I began reading this book not having much experience with the science fiction genre. I held only one preconceived notion regarding science fiction- it is cheesy.  This book didn't let me down, it is cheesy to the core.  Full of unbelievable, crazy, and sometimes just plain ridiculous stories and characters, the author does an excellent job of weaving humor into this cheesiness.  I would be lying if I said I didn't enjoy it.  The book is not as funny as Douglas Adam's writings and the humor is quite different, yet it is still laugh-out-loud funny.<br /><br />On a different note- as I read this book (I read it slowly, over the course of about three weeks), I relayed the story to my two young children almost every night at bedtime.  They were enthralled with the story.  Throughout the day they asked me what was happening next in the discworld.  One morning I woke up to my daughter (age 6) drawing pictures of the various characters and scenes in the book.  It has been great for their imagination.  Of course, I edited out a lot of what makes the book so great (wacky philosophy and twisted humor) but my daughters loved the story.  So it can be a book for the whole family to enjoy!
B00005JOFO|5.0|\\"Brokeback Mountain\\" is a film that is able to locate poignancy in the most foreign situation, one that is completely removed (at least ostensibly) from the experiences of your everyday Joe. There is a cord of universal truth that Ang Lee strikes through the film's central relationship, and the director explores with unerring grace and sensitivity the heartbreak that results from its inability to grow into something real and definable. Ennis (a flooring Ledger) and Jack (a very good Gyllenhaal) are constantly at odds with the constructs of their society, and as a result, their relationship remains perpetually thwarted; the realization that they need each other in the most primal way stymied. Lee draws the trajectory of their relationship with notable restraint, mirroring the social climate of 60s/70s Wyoming and also hinting at the insatiable thirst for personal freedom that writes underneath its machismo-laden surface. The tragedy of Brokeback Mountain ultimately lies in the failure between Ennis and Jack to reconcile their desires for one another, and it is the moment of recognition on the part of the former that marks the film's soaring emotional crescendo, the power of which is only deepened by the sense of loss that precedes it. \\"Brokeback Mountain\\" is not a \\"gay cowboy\\" movie in the most fundamental sense; it is a love story set amidst the backdrop of an imprisoning society, and a haunting study of how people can sometimes only change after it is too late.  <br /> <br />--9/10. <br />
B000B8QEZG|4.0|Madonna's still here and she's not declining. You can count on that. As for this review, here it goes: <br /> <br />Hung Up - 5/5 I love the ABBA sample and the overall music in this one. The video to me, is reflective of Madonna's love of dance and how she grew up with it and how she still loves it.  <br /> <br />Get Together - 5/5 I love love love the synth in this one. I hope they play this in the club because I will be dancing myself like crazy to this one. This one is moderatly paced. <br /> <br />Sorry - 4/5 I like this song...it is more or a disco groove that belongs in the club. It's moderatley paced and I think a lot will like it.  <br /> <br />Future Lovers - 3/5 This one is ok. I don't listen to it much, but I think there will be plenty of people who will. <br /> <br />I Love New York - 5/5 Now, I'm from Massachusetts (land of the Red Sox, lol) and I don't know if I'll hear a lot of people sing this song, but I don't mind one bit because I know I love this one (especially the powerful synth arrangement in the chorus) and it's one of my favorites off of the cd. I love how she chants \\"get off my street, get off my street\\". I'm sure it will be a big hit if released....ESPECIALLY in New York. <br /> <br />Let It Will Be - 5/5 And the excellent synth STILL keeps going. As a person who has grown up with dance music and electronic subgenres, I am a person heavily drawn to music with a lot of synth incorporated. This one does not lack synth. <br /> <br />Forbidden Love - 4/5 - This one is decent...I like how the song paces itself.  <br /> <br />Jump - 4/5 - A good anthem for the clubs. The chorus kicks in powerfully and it makes you want to dance. <br /> <br />How High - 3/5 - I don't really like this one, but it's still listenable. It's slower paced and has a groovy feel to it.  <br /> <br />Isaac - 5/5 A beautiful song. Reminds me of \\"Frozen\\". It starts out with a guy singing in another language (I'm thinking maybe Hebrew or Arabic?) and it sounds beautiful...it's like an instrument in itself. But the lyrics are mystical and the overal music is somewhat hypnotizing. <br /> <br />Push - 3/5 - This one is ok...I don't really listen to it. It's slower paced and reminds me of a 70s type of groove.  <br /> <br />Like It Or Not - 4/5 Appropriate ending. It's slower paced and it's about Madonna saying how she won't stop, like it or not. She'll do her own thing regardless of what you think, ha. <br /> <br />This was an automatic buy for me. As soon as I realized I liked the majority of the tracks, thats when I knew I had to buy it. <br /> <br />
B00005JNBQ|1.0|I watched this movie with a group of friends who are all over 40 and had seen it before.  They thought it was absolutely hilarious.  I wanted to go to bed after 10 minutes.  There was nothing clever, fresh, interesting, or funny.  It's an oddly predictable flick about a group of dysfunctional, unlovable losers who finally win out over the typical, beautiful-people snobs at the small-town high school.  Because I was with friends who thought they were doing me a favor, I had to restrain from yawning and checking my watch.  I kept waiting for laughs that never came.  It was like watching a film written by high school kids working on their first script, or one of those tediously long SNL skits (but I repeat myself).  By the end, I could sympathize with Alex from CLOCKWORK ORANGE who was forced to watch videos with his eyelids forced open. <br /> <br />I like oddball comedy, such as RAISING ARIZONA, Monty Python, and the like.  But this thing wasn't oddball; it was sLOWball. <br /> <br />Judging by the other reviews, I'm much in the minority on this one.  But I'm okay with that.

6305878323|5.0|Out of all the new movies and violence out there today I was shocked beyond belief when all 3 of my kids (10, 7 and 4) sat through this, not once but 4, and watched the entire movie!!! I guess there is good reason it's a classic Disney film.
B000BTJDGC|4.0|\\"The Exorcism of Emily Rose\\" is based on a true story, which would be the exorcism and death of in 1976 of Anneliese Michel, a young German girl.  The \\"Klingenberg Case\\" unfolded in the wake of the release of William Friedkin's \\"The Exorcist\\" and two years later prosecutors brought Anneliese's parents and the two exorcists to trial on charges of negligent homicides. What Scott Derrickson takes from that true story are not so much the details of the young woman's possession and the attempted exorcism, but the drama of a trial in which the state seeks to convict a priest for believing in faith rather than facts.  Consequentially, this 2005 is a rather unique blend of a trial film with a horror movie, and with regards to both parts of the equation it is both provocative and effective.<br /><br />Our vantage point in the story is that of Erin Bruner (Laura Linney), a criminal lawyer who has achieved notoriety for successfully defending a murderer.  The head of her firm (Colm Feore) dangles a partnership in front of her for taking the case of Father Moore (Tom Wilkinson), who has been charged with negligent homicide in the death of Emily Rose (Jennifer Carpenter).  Diagnosed as having epilepsy, the Father convinced Emily that she was a victim of demon possession and got her to stop taking her medication.  An exorcism was performed, but it was unsuccessful, and Emily starved to death.  Prosecuting the case if Ethan Thomas (Campbell Scott), a man of faith who believes in facts.  Bruner is an agnostic, which makes for an obvious irony as she defends the priest whose only concern is that he be allowed to testify and tell Emily's story.  Towards that end he has refused a plea agreement pushed by the archdiocese.<br /><br />Emily's story emerges in flashbacks during the trial, which puts the prosecution's case at a disadvantage from our perspective.  Thomas' alternative explanations for things like how Emily comes to know so many ancient languages ring hollow compared to what we have seen and heard in the flashbacks.  It is key that Thomas is a man of faith, that he is a believer whereas Bruner is not, but when he dismisses Moore's beliefs as archaic superstitions is he merely being a Protestant or is he drawing a line in the theological sand elsewhere?  To the point, does he believe in God but not Satan?  In both but not in possession?  More to the point, when faith and facts collide, why does he obviously side with the latter?  These questions matter to me because by focusing on the trial the story here is about what religious beliefs the law allows.  What is the difference between the religious exemption that allows Native Americans to smoke peyote and allowing  Christian Scientists to refuse medical treatment, and the right of the Catholic Church to perform the \\"Ritulae Romanum\\" of the Great Exorcism?<br /><br />Emily's position is succinctly put in her own words: \\"People say that God is dead, but how can they believe that when I show them the Devil?\\"  When \\"The Exorcist\\" came out I remember a poll where more people believed in Satan than in God, which seemed to me to be backwards from the standpoint of logic because Emily is right: the existence of Satan prove that of God, but believing in God does not necessarily mandate a believe in the devil.  Maybe that is where Thomas makes his stand.  But Derrickson has stacked the deck here: those who authorized the exorcism are off the hook, as are the parents, and the earnest Moore faces martyrdom essentially alone.<br /><br />What this film has going for it above anything else is an exceptionally strong cast.  Linney is an actress who exudes intelligence in everything she does, Scott shows measured disdain with just about every sentence he utters, and Wilkinson brings a remarkable sense of reasonableness to a priest in his position.  But special credit goes to Carpenter, who manifests most of Emily's possession through the use of her voice and body (the special features indicate the exceptions in this regard).  The fact that for the most part Linney is in the trial film rather than the horror movie helps her so much that in those few scenes where we are supposed to believe the demons are after her actually work against the movie because it works better if her perspective is no different from that of the jury.<br /><br />In the end I am bothered more by the film's resolution than by its implicit rhetorical questions.  I appreciate the importance of ambiguity in such a film, that for it to really work both Moore and Thomas must be right at face value, but it really is skewed towards the \\"truth\\" of the possession and having it both ways in the end is too much of a cop out for me.  Even the characters do not try to come to grips with what it all means given the battle that has been waged in the courtroom, which is why I round down on this one.act that for the most part Linney is in the trial film rather than the horror movie helps her so much that in those few scenes where we are supposed to believe the demons are after her actually work against the movie because it works better if her perspective is no different from that of the jury.

B000BNX3B4|3.0|\\"Must Love Dogs\\" is not so much a bad romantic comedy as it is a disappointing one.  That is because it features a strong cast that has Diane Lane and John Cusack as the romantic leads, with Elizabeth Perkins, Christopher Plummer, Dermot Mulroney and Stockard Channing is the supporting roles.  I had a crush of Diane Lane when she was on the cover of \\"TIME\\" for being in \\"A Little Romance\\" and was grateful when she grew up so that such feelings were no longer inappropriate.  I have liked John Cusack since before \\"Say Anything\\" (starting with \\"Eight Men Out\\" in fact), and have admired his choices for roles (and siblings).  Put these two together in a romantic comedy and I might actually go to the theater to see it instead of waiting until it comes out on DVD.  But I did not and I have to say I am glad that was the case.<br /><br />Sarah (Lane) is a kindergarten teacher who is now divorced and her family refuses to let her wallow in despair.  So her sister Carol (Perkins) puts Sarah's profile on an Internet dating service, using her high school graduation picture and the word \\"voluptuous.\\"  Meanwhile, Jake (John Cusack), who is also now divorced, finds that his friend has answered Sarah's add placed by Carol in his (Jake's) name.  So Sarah and Jack meet, each taking a dog that does not belong to them, and it does not go well.  This strikes us as being odd since they are obviously perfect for each other (their names appear before the titles, which is always a good clue).  But then when Sarah answers a personal add in the paper it turns out to be placed by her widowed father (Plummer), so odd is apparently her lot in life.  Besides, Sarah is interested in Bob (Mulroney), the father of one her students, even though obviously he is charm without substance.  Consequently, you have this 98-minute film, take off five minutes for the end credits and add another five to that total and figure out that at around the 88-minute mark Sarah will (a) figure out Jake is the guy for her and (b) do something about it.<br /><br />The 2005 film is based on Claire Cook's novel, but since Gary David Goldberg did the screenplay and directed the film the fault lies not with the stars but with the guy who created \\"Family Ties\\" and \\"Spin City.\\"  For me the point where the film derails is when Sarah goes to the store to buy a chicken for dinner.  The butcher tries to push a complete fryer on her for an extra 75 cents, but she does not want it and finally explodes.  The guy is not hitting on her, just trying to help, so instead of the scene being comic because she has to confess to being divorced and not needing more it just makes her seem rude.  It sets up a running gag with a bit of a payoff at the end, but by then it is too little too late.<br /><br />You understand that the characters are behind the viewers in that we know these two will end up together and they do not.  There are obstacles thrown in their way, but they are so minor and transparent they should not matter.  Then we get to the point where Sarah realizes she really likes Jake and goes to tell him only to discover he is on a date.  This would be a bad sign.  But the date in question makes it painfully obvious that she is from Pluto while Jake is from Venus (I also love \\"Doctor Zhivago\\").  The girl should be the only one in the scene who does not know that Jake is going to unhook her and throw her back in the sea, but, no, Sarah cannot see the obvious either (Jake sure can).  The final nail in the coffin is when we get to the grand romantic gesture at the end that brings the couple together, because compared to standing there with a ghetto blaster playing \\"In Your Eyes,\\" what this film comes up with is all wet.her and (b) do something about it. <br /> <br />The 2005 film is based on Claire Cook's novel, but since Gary David Goldberg did the screenplay and directed the film the fault lies not with the stars but with the guy who created \\"Family Ties\\" and \\"Spin City.\\"  For me the point where the film derails is when Sarah goes to the store to buy a chicken for dinner.

B000BTJDGC|4.0|I was expecting, based on the commercials I'd heard and seen on the radio and television, a film that would be insanely disturbing and unsettling.  The point of this story runs far deeper than gore and disturbing imagery could conjure. <br /> <br />This movie is extremely well produced and performed - and it plays on our fear of possibility.  We've all heard stories of forms of possession and exorcism - never knowing what truly happened in these instances.  This allows the viewer to be drawn into the movie.  The mysterious occurrances portrayed will no doubt stir our suspicions.   <br /> <br />The courtroom setting utilized brings these unearthly and mysterious elements into the \\"real world\\"; the world where reason is supposed to dictate what is perceived as truth.  This exposes us to the ways in which people react to the telling of such experiences.  We are then left to form our own conclusions, drawing on our beliefs and fears: the belief of what is possible and our fear of those very things actually happening to people.  All of this makes for great entertainment and great reflection.  Expecting a film to disturb and rattle me, I was unprepared for what I was exposed to. <br /> <br />The DVD contains 3 featurettes: Genesis of the Story, Casting the Movie and Visual Design.  These lengthy featurettes give great insight into the film's production, from the origins of the desire to create a film based on the real life experiences of Anneliese Michel to the means by which the filmmakers visually created the world of torment Emily Rose suffered.  All elements were carefully chosen in creating the \\"look\\" of the recalled scenes of Emily's experiences.  Great attention was paid to the color, lighting, sound and dialogue of these scenes - all of which is discussed in the featurette.  There is also a deleted scene included in the special features which wouldn't have done much for the film had it been included. <br /> <br />This film did not turn out to be what I had expected, yet it entertained me in a different way and had effects that lasted beyond the viewing of the movie.  It will please fans of horror movies, thrillers, dramas, etc...
B000BW7QWW|5.0|Like many, I watched the show on tv, purchased the HIGHLY RECOMENDED series box set and saw the movie the first weekend. All worthwile, and some of the best entertainment of its kind in the verse. A really good choice for Star Trek fans, a must for Firefly fans. kudos to JW.
B000BW7QWW|5.0|If you're looking for space opera ala Star Wars prequels, you probably won't care for Serenity or Firefly. There aren't lasers (the central characters are all poor, can't afford them), aliens, or elaborate costuming. <br /> <br />However, the characters are much more three dimensional and real than the wooden prequel characters, no whiny selfcentered wifebeating cardboard props here. The main villian does what he does because he believes his actions are in society's best interests, not the same old desire to conquer the galaxy or whatever. The characters are distinct personalities, unlike the Star Wars prequels where, with the exception of Ewan McGregor & Liam Neeson, I really didn't relate to anyone as a person, let alone a character with motivations. If you have fond memories of Han and Leia bickering and pretending they don't care, if you miss Lando's banter, you'll get much closer to it here than in EpIII. <br /> <br />There are some nuances that will be lost if you haven't seen Firefly, but that doesn't detract from the movie's enjoyability. I watched the movie without having seen the series first, Joss will fill you in on everything you need to know to enjoy the movie. It's definitely worth your time.
B000002U82|5.0|Its hard to think of pink floyd and DSOTM with out thinking of college,  I think its almost a given that by the time one gets into college and finds themself living on campus there will come a point when u meet that one stoner and said stoner will ask u \\"wanna listen to some floyd?\\" and thats it. and now usually the choices will be Wish You Were Here, Dark Side of The Moon or The Wall,  now all 3 are great in their own way but theres somethign bout that darn Dark Side,  Could it be the Lyric? now granted Roger Waters was no Dylan and a line like \\"breath, breath in the air/ dont be afraid to care\\" wont have u racking your brain like the Beatles \\"I Am The Walrus\\" but thats the beauty of it, words so simple yet so straight to the point, and considering how many joints have been smoked by listeners while playing this epic disc (one of the 10 biggest selling albums of all time) perhaps its a good thing they keep the words as simple and short as possible . <br />Maybe its all those effects, the cash register ringing at both the start of Speak To Me as well as used as part of the riff for Money, the sound of racing footsteps for On The Run just before the sound of that jet plane crashing as well as all the spoken comments which seem to weave in and out through out the entire album , that almost give u the sense of not being alone, like ur stuck in some sort of waiting room with all these other lunatics (on the grass of course). <br />Or maybe its just the music man !!! considering how un-rock the entire piece is there are moments when the Floyd prove just how versatile they can be,  from the soft and soothing Breath, to epic sound piece Great Gig IN The Sky,  to the just downright funky   Money , the band is always showing that they were more then just a really cool band to watch a light show while getting stoned to.  but enough of my ranting, BUY THE DAMM RECORD!!!
B0000TB05A|5.0|Having rented and seen the Boston concert once some months ago, I really was doubting it could hardly get matched or even improved because of the image and sound quality and the huge costs that you can really see in the production of the Boston concert video. <br />Besides, the cover of this particular DVD didn't tell me anything special about this concert, since it looked a bit understated for me. How could it possibly match the Boston show? But, fortunately, when something grabs my attention, eventhough it may just grab a tiny little bit of it, I always like to read the reviews and opinions of other people regarding a product or subject, whenever this is possible. <br /> <br />Having read all the raving reviews about this concert, I was encouraged to give it a try, specially after reading the opinion of people who have seen both shows and described this one as being better. <br />I'm happy I was curious, since this show really rocks!!! As most reviewers mentioned, this show makes the Boston show feel as the band was under some unspoken pressure and made them look kinda distant (without taking anything away from the show's spectacularity). I just received my copy yesterday, but because of time limitations, I was just able to watch 5 tracks but you could really tell the greatness and joy of the band being in their home, with their \\"tribe\\" as Bono put it. <br /> <br />I think, that soundwise this shows sounds a little (but just a little) weaker and less defined (at least in my home set)than the Boston show, but the sound is still great!! Overall, this concert really feels in better mood than the Boston show and it really captures the joy of being home with your tribe!!! <br /> <br />U2 is a band that really will always have something to give to their audience on their shows, although their latest couple of album recordings couldn't match their \\"classic\\" ones (i.e. before Achtung Baby, which was really the last biggest smash seeing the album as a whole)althought theyreally got pretty close, but they'll always be there as an iconic rock band of all-time. Keep up the good work, guys!!

038542471X|3.0|This Grisham  novel is an easy read with lots of character development and a tortuous plot that twists and turns on every other page. Our \\"hero\\",Mark,  is a cunning  11 year old boy who is resentful of authority and  disrespectful. Our  \\"heroine\\", Reggie Love,  is a 52 year old lawyer, also resentful of authority and  even more disrespectful of her imagined adversaries.  She takes  command of every situation and everyone who crosses her path, with  the sole exception of that very same 11 year old boy.  Reggie, who is  so strong, forceful and manipulative of FBI agents  and Federal Attorneys, is putty in  the hands of Mark. She allows an 11 year old boy to manipulate her into aiding his escape  from juvenile detention and exposure  to unnecessary extreme danger and possible prison and the loss of  her license to practice law. Very  much out of character and therefore not a credible plot. However, if one can suspend belief and simply read the book as entertainment, as one would a Buck Roger's novel, you won't be disappointed.

B00005JO1Y|4.0|Carl Denham (Black) is a filmmaker who wants to get his film made.  The problem is that creditors are after him and he is missing a leading lady.  Ann Darrow (Watts) is an out of work actress who stumbles across Denham's path.  When she agrees, they make a hasty retreat to the \\"Venture\\", the ship that will take them to the filming location.  In the process, he manages to strand screenwriter Jack Driscoll (Brody) on board.  Soon, they ae heading for Skull Island.<br /><br />Once there, the filming begins, only to be interrupted by the natives, who have a tendency to remove the heads from their victims.  Ann is offered up as a sacrifice to the dominant male of the island, a big ape by the name of Kong (Serkis).  Instead of killing her, he develops a crush on her.  After a long chase on the island, we go back to New York for the fateful ending.<br /><br />\\"King Kong\\" is a good movie, full of action, special effects, and heart.  Serkis gives Kong a realness that has not been seen before.  The action is tense and unrelenting.  Black and Brody do good jobs as their respective characters.  Watts shows she can act convincingly with a green screen.  The biggest drawback to this film is the running time.  At over three hours, \\"King Kong\\" is at least an hour too long.  This is not an epic tale, despite getting the epic treatment, and the film is hurt by it.  Fans of Peter Jackson (and there are many) will no doubt be thrilled by everything in this movie, and for them I recommend this film highly.  Otherwise, you may want to wait to DVD so you can have access to a pause button.
B000BTJDGC|4.0|Many horror films lately are built so that it uses disorienting camera trickery and loud music jolts and call it a horror film. Many well done ones were more about atmosphere and tension. This film does have it where you feel slightly unnerved and not extremely calm although as a film it might have certain elements you may not like. <br /> <br />Based on a true story, the story tells of Emily Rose, a 19 year old college student who died. The main suspect is Father Moore, who disallowed any medical or hospitalization of Emily. Why? Well it's believed that she is the carrier of a demon and a victim of possession. After a failed exorcism she turns up dead so was it his fault or something else entirely? Well I might as well say it now, the film doesn't answer this and I bet it was designed so it wouldn't. <br /> <br />I always find it funny that Muslims, Buddhists and Catholics will so strongly believe in a higher power(naturally God or Jesus Christ or Allah) and yet we completely shoot down any possibility or demons or creatures. We're interested in the stars and possible planets capable of supporting life yet we find aliens and UFO phenomenons absolute sci-fi nerd nonsense. So when the prosecutor mentions he's a man of faith, we go \\"you believe in one higher power but not the other?\\" <br /> <br />The film doesn't really rely on shock tactics like Boogeyman or Amityville Horror remake but it relies mainly on mood. In other words, the filmmakers are trying to mess with your head and leave you uneasy and it's quite effective. There is a couple jump scenes as I call them but they're few and far between.  <br /> <br />Performance-wise is straight across the board(except for whoever played the prosecutor. His cry baby objections get grating). Laura Linney is always reliable, being a very versatile actress and Tom Wilkinson, last seen playing a mob boss in Batman Begins is effective as Father Moore. In particular mention is Jennifer Carpenter playing our unfortunate title character. A lot of her performance is for real and that makes it more chilling and quite a lung power on her. <br /> <br />Where the film falls on its face is where information is told to us in periodic moments so something new shows up. The 3 AM thing shows up but it's not explained until way later. Even certain keywitness are ignored. One particular witness is never even called who witnessed the exorcism. You can see the filmmakers intent to drum up curiousity and makes us question things but since speculation runs rampant on whether it's a science explanation or a matter of faith, many events are just standing there without us figuring out where to put our mind. <br /> <br />If you want a genuine film that'll creep you out, can't go wrong here. I'm not buying it since it's not my taste but guys, if you're renting this so your woman can cling to you you might just cling back.
B00006I53S|5.0|When reading reviews on Canon lenses you will find a lot of varied opinions. Some people feel that anything other than L series glass is a waste of money while others disagree and say that they are overpriced for most peoples use. However for those of us that don't have the kind of money to throw around on L series lenses we have to make do with what's available at the low end of the price scale.  <br /> <br />Make no mistake, the EF 28-135mm is a great lens for the money. It's a chunky metal barreled lens that is at first a little on the heavy side. However once you get used to the weight this turns into a bonus as it makes it easier to steady. The USM motor means that the auto-focus is fast, and the Image stabilizer(IS) means that you can go down an f-stop or two in low light. The optics are superb, pictures are generally sharp and colors are bright.  <br /> <br />If I have one criticism its that the lens is a little bit unforgiving as you approach maximum zoom, and so some softness does creep in if you don't get the shutter and ISO settings right or if the light isn't great. However pictures taken with the lens sharpen up nicely in Photoshop, so this can easily be fixed during post processing. <br /> <br />If you are looking for a good general purpose lens with a decent zoom or are ready to move away from the lens that came with your D-SLR then I strongly recommend taking a look at this lens.
B00005K9LK|4.0|Judas Priest's most successful disc (double platinum in the US alone) was their follow-up to the tepid 'Point of Entry' of the previous year. 'Screaming for Vengeance' saw Priest reach the height of their popularity and achieve well earned success. So why do I consider this record the most overrated of their careers? Simple, because it can't hold a candle to anything they did in their glory years of 1976-1980. This album was programmed to be lapped up by the masses (read as dumbed down). It is probably the heaviest commercial record of its day, the guitars and drums are outrageously loud!! But is it great metal? Iron Maiden released 'The Number of the Beast' also in 1982, and 'Beast' blows Priest away in its songwriting and mythmaking. What gives this album its not all well deserved reputation, the hits of course! \\"You've Got Another Thing Comin'\\" is probably their most famous song but far from genius. Favorites include \\"Riding On the Wind\\", easily the best tune on 'Screamin'\\" Title song is awesome too in its display of guitar pyrotechnincs. \\"Electic Eye\\", \\"Bloodstone\\" and \\"Devil's Child\\" are other popular faves as well, but again, they've done better. \\"Child\\"'s main riff is a monster but the chorus kind of blows. \\"Eye\\" is a great opener and probably the second best song on the disc. Some songs are just plain tedious, (\\"Take These Chains\\"???? Please!!!!!!). But overall a solid effort, just not one the greatest metal discs of all time, but there you go again with reputation. Why on God's green earth would a turd like \\"Prisoner of Your Eyes\\" be put on a reissue of this classic??? I don't know, maybe I've just owned this record for too long and I don't have fresh ears, but I don't think I'm wrong ('Sad Wings', 'Hell Bent' and 'British Steel' still kick ass so it must be 'Screaming's' songs and not me!) Still worth a sawbuck for the education of a metalphile, but please don't call this Priest greatest acheivement or \\"Another Thing Comin'\\" their best song. That's just dumb.
B00097DXZS|4.0|It's a shame that most of the negative reviews of this album focus on the \\"Root Kit\\" that Sony has unfortunately decided to start adding to their artist's cd's, and not on the content of the album itself.  The Santana Band (who have posted an appology on their website) has nothing to do with the production of the cd itself, just the music contained on the cd.  As far as the music goes, there is some substance here.  \\"All That I Am\\" will not go down as one of Santana's all-time great albums, but that doesn't mean there aren't some gems.  The best among these are the Michelle Branch collab \\"I'm Feeling You\\", the Steven Tyler track \\"Just Feel Better\\", and the instrumental \\"Trinity\\" featuring the AMAZING Robert Randolph (check him out live if you EVER get the chance), and Metallica's Kirk Hammett.  But the cream of the crop here is the joint venture with Anthony Hamilton \\"Twisted\\".  Now that is one bad-ass song!  Should be a chart topper if ever released as a single.  Other good tracks feature Mary J. Blige and Los Lonely Boys, but \\"Twisted\\" is worth the price of admission on it's own.  The 1st 2 songs are fun Latin jams, but do sound a little \\"over-produced\\" and too neatly packaged for a traditional Santana album, but are definitely listenable.  I bought this cd the day it was released and bought a second copy through Amazon.UK so that I would be able to load it to my Ipod without Sony's \\"booby-trap\\" and haven't had a single problem.  I think 4-out-of-5 stars is fair for this outing based on the music provided.
B000002JK4|5.0|About a year ago I was driving in my car one night and heard \\"In the Mood\\" on the radio.  It instantly clicked.  This was a song I'd heard before and loved but had never owned and hadnt heard in quite some time.  I didn't even know who sang it, although I thought it sounded like Plant and that was affirmed when the station dj came on after the song.  I got home and immediately downloaded this entire album, to my recolection not having ever heard a single other track other than In the Mood.   <br /> <br />A year later I can say this is one in a handfull of my favorite albums of all time(others range from 'Blood Sugar Sex Magic' and 'Ten' to 'Confrontation' and 'A Love Movement'.  <br /> <br />This album makes me think of far away places and open roads in the desert, which is odd to me because I've never listened to it while in such places (Big Log and In the Mood particularly have this effect on me).  <br /> <br />Yes the individual tracks are amazing, but the album is just as effective as a whole because of its consistency to evoke a feeling or mood.  Like all great albums, from beginning to end the feel is consistent, and for me it's one of reflection, tranquility, and broad and undiscovered horizons. My love is in league with the freeway.  <br /> <br />I'll probably be listening to this in 30 years...
B00001ODHL|5.0|Well, whaddaya know? Sam and Bruce have done it again. Evil Dead was a classic horror movie, Evil Dead II a hysterical comedy-horror flick, and now we have Army of Darkness, which is basically adventure-comedy with some horror elements. Last we saw Ash (Bruce Campbell), he was being hailed as a king by medieval warriors. This one, however, has Ash being chained and hauled off to a pit full of monsters with Henry the Red and his men. So, apparently, these guys are bipolar: first they want to honor Ash, now they wanna kill him. (Blow) Anyway, Ash kicks ass with his fists and the aid of a chainsaw for a right hand, and he's told by the Wiseman in town that the Necronomican, aka the Book of the Dead, or the book that's been in a pain in Ash's ass for two movies, has a passage that can take Ash back to the present. Unfortunately, Ash has more brawn than brains, and he mispronounces the words needed to safely take the book from its pedestal. This raises skeletons from a nearby graveyard, who find a leader in Bad Ash, the evil version of Ash that he shot, decapitated, and buried. Bad Ash is pissed, and he leads the bony dead to the town to retrieve the Necronomican. At first, Ash plans to head home and let the locals deal with the dead. Then his new gal Sheila (Embeth Davidtz) is taken and possessed by Bad Ash, and Ash's conscience kicks in, so he leads a group of brave men, including feuding warriors Arthur and Henry, to battle the dead at the castle. Will Ash and his men be able to defeat the Army of Darkness? Yeah...maybe he's a Chinese jet pilot...<br /><br /> As you can see, this movie is crazy fun. It's got plenty of blood for the horror fans, but it also is a throwback to the likes of Jason & the Argonauts. Think of it as a Michigan Wiseass in King Arthur's Court...with talking skeletons and chainsaws and explosions. Oh, and a classic finale in Ash's place of employment, S-Mart, where he saves the day and gets the girl...in 5 minutes. Hail to the king, indeed.
B00008BXJG|5.0|This album is what rock & roll is all about. From the first song, to the last song, it just sounds good. I believe that this album, and Powerage and Let There Be Rock define Ac/Dc. Other albums are more popular, or have sold more albums, but to me, do not overpass the pure music of this album, or the other two I mentioned. Bon Scott is a maniac on the mike, and has such a grand voice for rock & roll. Angus & Malcum give this album the groove and the beat that goes through your brain. It is rock & roll at its finest. It's high energy, and give it everything you got music. If your looking for how good Ac/Dc can be, you need go no farther than this album. This truly is the personification of Ac/Dc and Rock & Roll.
0553801503|1.0|I read the first 3 books in this series in less than 10 days (many sleepless nights!)  My biggest annoyance was all the extraneous geneology and minor character details but the story was so good I pushed through anyhow.  This new book is a slap in the face, basically it has mostly minor characters and nothing happens.<br /><br />Where is this guy's editor?  It is not like he doesn't have enough interesting main characters already.  Why not write about them? Yes, I know about the supposed 2000 page book split in half etc but he could have written the good book first. Instead we have to wait till 2007!  I think he should write 2 versions of every book from now on one version with the great stories characters & twists  the other with all the genealogy, excessive details and minor characters.  Lets see which version sells better.<br /><br />Bottom Line , I feel betrayed.
B00026KDC2|5.0|This album is excellent from the first song to the last. If you enjoy the black crowes, then you will enjoy this album. The sound is awesome, and the lead singers voice is one-of-a-kind. Some songs tend to be raunchy in their subject matter, but the way the music is put together is awesome. I truely believe that if the Black Crowes had not exploded onto the music world in the way that they did, then this band very easily could have exploded in the same way. The sound is excellent.
B00005JO1J|5.0|Despite all the bad and lukewarm reviews this movie has received, I must say that I really loved it. Although it's extremely difficult to transpose a stage production onto film, I think Columbus did a great job in doing so. Sure, some of the acting was a little \\"larger-than-life\\", but that's what one must do on stage. It was a huge gamble bringing back the original cast, mainly because it's so hard to dilute a bombastic stage personality into a more realistic film one. I have experience that firsthand. But despite all of this, I found the characters very real and very moving. They weren't developed as they could have been, but I haven't been that emotionally moved in a long time. What the storyline lacks, the universal message and wonderful music makes up for. It is definitely one of my favorite post-Webber musicals.
B0007OCG4W|4.0|Okay, let's get something straight right away.  If you cheat on your partner, you do NOT tell.  In fact, if you are asked about who you slept with in the past, you do not tell.  Even in junior high school you learned, you do not kiss and tell.<br /><br />Cheating is the big lie.  This movie is about cheating and lying.  People cheat.  They get tempted.  They want excitement.  People are animals.  But it is worse than adding insult to injury if you cheat and tell.  Don't cheat.  But if you do, don't tell.<br /><br />This is a clever--although I wouldn't call it slick--film about how attractive people of a certain age and milieu are always hitting on and being hit upon.  It is about the shallowness of love and the urgency of sex.  It is about pretty people on the screen fulfilling fantasies.  The dialogue is hip, sharp, although sometimes too cute and superficial.<br /><br />It is stylish and ephemeral.  It has the facade of realism.  Note that none of the characters have children and none of them are trying to save the world.  They are sexual and emotional hedonists, and maybe they are saying something about our times, in the big cities of the Western world at the dawn of the new millennium. On the other hand, they are urban professionals, skillfully navigating their way through the urban jungle toward a life of fulfillment and meaning...  Well, maybe not.<br /><br />But the emotions that the characters experience are very real.  When you love someone and that someone sleeps with your rival, it is very painful.  And when you love someone and you find that that someone doesn't love you, it is very painful.  But the psychological pain that is visited upon us at such times is also ephemeral and will pass.<br /><br />If you live on a farm in the middle of Nebraska, Jude Law is not going to kiss you and tempt you into cheating on your husband even if you are as pretty as Julia Roberts.  If you really are a plain Jane without style or looks, Clive Owen is going to pass you by as you sit in the aquarium.  He'll study the fish.  So this is really about Hollywood itself (although set in London) and the usual musical beds.  This is TV's \\"Friends\\" in the raw.  This is Mike Nichols updating Carnal Knowledge, his very sixties-ish quadrangle film released in 1971 starring Jack Nicholson, Art Garfunkel, Ann-Margret and Candice Bergen.  As in Carnal Knowledge--and, by the way, in Milan Kundera's novel The Unbearable Lightness of Being (made into a film starring Juliette Binoche)--there are four attractive, sexually active people who can't keep their hands off of one another.  If you liked triangles, you randy geometricians, you'll really love quads, seems to be the thinking here.<br /><br />Well, I did kind of like this film.  What's not to like about Natalie Portman, Julia Roberts, Jude Law and Clive Owen?  They are attractive and they are talented.  The script from Patrick Marber adapting his play of the same name (with some very real influence from Milan Kundera's novel: note that in both cases there is a doctor and one of the women is in the sexual professions and the other is either a photographer or a painter) is witty and, yes, sexy.  The direction by Mike Nichols (now in his seventies) is a little uneven and sometimes cryptic, especially as regards the ending and the beginning.  (Never mind.  I would like to discuss the ending, but, alas, that might spoil the film for somebody.  As for the \\"Boy Meets Girl, Cute\\" beginning...well, it was VERY familiar.)  But the film is crisply edited and there are no dead spots.  You will be entertained, even if you later feel that you got seduced yourself and feel like you just ate a whole box of sugary bon-bons.<br /><br />Irony: while Natalie Portman plays the lower-class stripper, in real life she is (or was) working toward a medical degree at Harvard.<br /><br />And yes, Alice always lies and Larry always tells the truth...well, almost.  Alice's character is very complex, but not entirely realizedin the film.  We are too much distracted by the sexcapades and the other personalities to see her as clearly as we might.  Portman does a good job in a challenging role.  There is something almost pathological about Alice that Portman conveys with modulated swings in mood and expression.  Larry, the doc, is, as he tells us, the caveman, while Dan is the emotional pretty boy.  And Anna...well, Anna is smart and has a deeper appreciation than the other characters of who she is and what she wants.  And she does manage to get what she wants.<br /><br />See this for Mike Nichols whose credits include Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf (1966), The Graduate (1967), Silkwood (1983), Postcards from the Edge (1990), and a number of other very successful films.  In Closer, he shows once again that he still knows what interests the current generation.the other personalities to see her as clearly as we might.  Portman does a good job in a challenging role.

B000089RVX|5.0|Evanescence is one of the most powerful bands i've ever listened to. Singer Amy Lee has such a powerful voice, that your drawn to listen to the entire album, which in my opinion is one of the best of all time. Her voice along with the music around it is haunting and also very mysterious making people want to listen. <br /> <br />Going Under, the first track on the album is one of the heavier songs, but is one of the best!!! This song realy speaks to everyone! <br /> <br />Bring Me To Life, is the number one song that people know from the band. It was all over the radio and has taken the band to superstar fame! <br /> <br />Everybodies Fool is one of the songs that realy says what this band is like. It takes you down into their core and lets you see the true band. <br /> <br />My Imortal, is one of the best songs. Amy Lees' voice is so chilling it is the best of any other song. She has the voice to beat among all women, and it shows on this song! <br /> <br />Haunted, is a great song that makes you realy think about things going on around you. <br /> <br />My Tournaquet, this song is my favorite, the lyrics are a bit strange, but when you realize what type of person is singing them(that's not a bad thing) you get the meaning behind them. <br /> <br />Imaginary, is a great transfer from Tournaquet, and has some of the same spooky eerie symbolism behind it. <br /> <br />Taking Over Me, one of the greatest songs ever writen. This song has a great line of lyrics and a moving chorus! <br /> <br />Hello, let me just say that it is all about the voice on this song, and Amy delivers! <br /> <br />My Last Breath, a little more ordinary than the rest of the album, but still a great song. <br /> <br />Whisper, some say that this song doesn't captivate them, well they don't know what their talking about. The whole point of the song is to let you realize who this band is and where they've been and where they are going. <br /> <br />Overall, this cd is one that is always near my radio ready to be listened to!!!!!!
B000BNX3B4|4.0|A teacher and a boat maker cross paths in a romantic comedy about online dating. Both have had bitter divorces in the last year. Diane Lane plays Sarah, a laid back teacher who thinks she's had her one chance at a life with someone and John Cusack plays Jake, the tightly strung artist who's been deeply wounded by love. Their first meeting, like many others, does not go smoothly but somehow they end up on a second and third date. All Jake wants is honesty and all Sarah wants, well she isn't sure what she wants until the end of the film so she flip flops between a few men. Diane Lane as always is stunning to look at. She has quick wit. John Cusack is still charming but I didn't see as much of him as I would have liked. This film while it has some comedic moments is a drama about relationships after divorce. The antics of extended family and friends are thrown in to lighten the blow. An enjoyable film. A few gags in the features but otherwise sparse.
B00001OH7T|5.0|I have been a Bowie fan for years, and have had a particularly keening interest in his 1970's recordings since I first heard the man.  As a result of Bowie's ever-changing style and interests, this album is a very interesting one-off in his career.  The material is to me, completely uplifting; it has great grooves, soulful and heart rending singing, and enough great funky and expansive sounding instrumentation to give the whole affair some spring in the step.  This is a very sexy album (if an album can be sexy), and can really put you in a great mood.  I can't help but grin stupidly when I hear David's inflections, particularly in the songs that many other reviewers seem to scorn; \\"win\\", \\"right\\", \\"fascination\\", and \\"somebody up there likes me\\".  Amongst Bowie's other mid-seventies releases (Live, Station to Station, Low, Heroes, etc.)this album can seem a bit out of place.  But taken on its own this is a very strong and satisfying album.
B00005JNX0|4.0|This is the story of four friends, best friends who just happen to be animals. Alex the Lion who's spoiled with grooming and precut steaks; Marty the Zebra who loves his life but yearns for some more, Melman the hypochondriac Giraffe and Gloria the Hippo who acts as a surrogate mother to the other three. From the beginning we see how spoiled these friends are with their every whim filled by their caretakers.<br /><br />They end up packed in crates bound for a African preserve after Marty decides he wants to see \\"the wild\\" and goes out wandering in the streets of New York. This probably wouldn't have been so bad were it not for his friends deciding to go save him. Lions roaming the streets are a little more serious than Zebras. I didn't appreciate the humour of the NY cop asking his boss if he could shoot the Zebra. Because of unforeseen circumstances they end up severed from the ship, floating in the ocean and finally landing on a tropical paradise.<br /><br />Like any movie there are scene stealers. In this case, it's the four military trained penguins that also have their own Christmas short in the features area. Another scene stealer is an itty bitty lemur named Mort who has Puss-in-boot eyes and a nervous giggle.<br /><br />Obviously not true to life;  the gates are low so the animals can get to one another or at the crowds but then it's not every day you can hear a Zebra, Lion, Giraffe and Hippo talk, dance and sing. Great fun for kids but if the adults are looking for fun they'll only be mildly amused. As always the graphics are great, the music is toe tapping and there is humour. There are a few minute frightening scenes when the animals realize they are not in a Zoo anymore and cute cuddly little beings are being eaten by bigger not so cute ones but this is really short. There are a few other sad/dark points but overall it is a fun movie.
B0002F6BRE|5.0|Will Farrel portrays Buddy, the elf, who has come to NYC to find his long lost human father. Buddy accidentally crawled into Santa's bag when he was a baby and grew up at the North Pole making toys when he overheard that he was a human. In the course of the story Buddy finds out who his father is and tries to bond with him. Buddy's father, played brilliantly by James Caan is a serious workaholic who is neglectful of his family, and wants no relationship with Buddy. Yet with Buddy's charm and hilarious ways he warms up to his father and new family.<br /><br /> Will Farrell makes this movie so funny from his facial gestures, stunts, and speeches. The best parts is his assimilation in NYC and his job at Gimbels Department Store where he falls in love with a clerk and faces a \\"fraudulant\\" Santa Clause. Other wonderful actors include Bob Newhart as Buddy's adopted elf father and Mary Steenburgen as Buddy's new stepmom.<br /><br />  Besides being wonderful for its good bits of humor, and fine cast, the movie has some wonderful graphics as many of the creatures from the North Pole were derived from the old 1950s Christmas classics. This movie is wonderful for children and adults to watch together.
B000002ITK|4.0|IM REALLY 15, NOT A KID  <br /> <br />  OK, first of all u little ass, TS were not a one it wonder, they were very popular (among the metal community).  And you are obviusly not a a very big TS fan because any SMF worth his boots (or makeup rather) would be proud to admit that they like a group of makeup wearing, cross dressing rockers.  I am only 15 so i dident live the eightys either but at least i show that i love the bands from the era however odd they may seem by todays standards.  Sure people say to me: \\"your gay, u like guys in tight pants and makup!\\" and i say \\"Ya i do, so what?\\".  bottom line if your gunna like hair metal, or any other rock from yester-year, be proud, show it, and take the flack in good stride. ok now that i have that out of my system, i can begin my review. <br /> <br />Big Hits is a good cd to start ut with if u want to get into TS. When my little brofirst got this, i liked the songas on this cd, but dident like TS's other albums.  After i listened to this, i gradually started to like the other albums.  I am now a huge fan and own all the albums (including the newly released Wacken CD/DVD) exept under the blade (which i cant find anywere).  So for starting out this cd is great even though it is missing a few vital tracks. <br /> <br />soo in thewords of Dee: PLAY IT LOUD MUTHA!!!
B000094PYF|5.0|Led Zeppelin's excellent follow up second album is essential listening especially if you are into rock guitar wizardry.  Jimmy Page continues playing some excellent rock guitar here and shows why at one time he was the most requested session guitarist in the industry.  Tracks like \\"Whole Lotta Love\\", \\"Heartbreaker\\", \\"Living Loving Maid\\" and \\"Ramble On\\" are all classic rock standards.  Now, we get this album very well remastered and in a very nicely done mini-lp replica gatefold sleeve as well.  Great sound quality, great packaging, this is a must have in any classic rock lover's collection.  Highly recommended!
B00063F8B2|5.0|This movie has the most beautiful music I have ever heard.  Believe is one of my favorite songs now.  I love the main theme used throughout the movie
B000094PYH|5.0|Everyone raves about IV because of \\"Stairway...\\" and rightly so but as an overall great album with cohesive, musically interesting ideas and just great tracks, \\"Houses of the Holy\\" has to be Led Zeppelin's best album.  From the great opening track, \\"The Song Remains the Same\\" to the brilliant \\"The Ocean\\" that ends the album, welcome to a wonderland of music whose greatness transcends genre and is clearly one of the best albums of all time.<br /><br />At the height of their popularity and musical powers, Jimmy Page shows how big-headed the band had become when he explained the meaning of the album title: a description of what Jimmy felt at the time that rock music concerts had become the new churches with audiences worshipping what was going on on the stage i.e. the new houses of the holy.<br /><br />Still, Jimmy remained faithful to his mission from the first album and that was to fuse his musical influences, folk, blues and rock into a unique sonic offering and he succeeds to great effect here.  My favourite Led Zeppelin song of all-time is on this disc \\"Over the Hills and Far Away\\" which is a study in folk guitar integration with rock and blues elements.  Then comes \\"The Crunge\\", a very humourous spoof on James Brown and funk music and then my other favourite \\"D'yer Maker\\" an attempt at reggae/ska comes up.<br /><br />Yes, Led Zeppelin could rock with the best and could create rock anthems like \\"Stairway...\\" and \\"Rock and Roll\\" but what really impressed me about them was Jimmy Page's creative, experimental genius which is amply showcased here on this album.  Even the late great classical composer, Igor Stravinsky was a fan and that's the brilliance of Jimmy Page: the ability to create very interesting musical ideas from diverse musical styles.<br /><br />This version is very, very well remastered and comes in a very cool mini-lp gatefold replica sleeve with the lyrics included in both English and Japanese.  The sound quality is brilliant and so is the packaging making this the best version of the album that's out there.  Very highly recommended.the packaging making this the best version of the album that's out there.  Very highly recommended.
B000BW7QX6|5.0|I'm such a geek.  I kinda watched this twice, and it was kinda totally worth it.  I'm not sure how much a viewer who hadn't already watched the \\"Firefly\\" TV series would get out of this, but if you get the \\"Firefly\\" box set and this feature film together, then you will be in for one heckuva good time.  The film looks good, the actors are all in fine form, the fight choreography is spectacular, and that good old Joss Whedon sense of humor is right there, weird and wonderful as it ever was.  Plus, it's not just a recap of the TV plot, but rather a lively, smart coda to that great storyline.  I wish all pop culture could be this intelligent and this much fun.<br /><br />Yay, Joss.  Keep up the good work.
B00005JKWJ|5.0|Since movie audiences made \\"Blade\\" a big success, it's no surprise that New Line Cinema would put writer David S. Goyer (\\"The Crow: City of Angels\\" and \\"Blade\\") hard at work on crafting the sequel.  The key to a successful movie franchise is to try to keep most of the key players throughout, meaning the same actors for the same roles, so after getting David S. Goyer back to write the sequel, New Line pursued both Wesley Snipes and Kris Kristofferson to return to the roles of Blade and Whistler.  Once these tasks were accomplished and the script was written, and director Guillermo Del Toro (\\"Mimic\\") was tapped to helm the film, everything was set for the cameras to roll for \\"Blade 2\\". <br /> <br />Picking up a year or two after the first film, \\"Blade 2\\" puts Blade (Wesley Snipes) hot on the tail of some vampires who are hiding Whistler (Kris Kristofferson) somewhere, and keeping him alive as a vampire.  After freeing his mentor, Blade is confronted by an elite group of vampires known as the Bloodpack.  The Bloodpack informs Blade that a new enemy of vampires has emerged, but this new enemy called Reapers, are not solely after vampires, they hunt humans as well.  To stop the Reapers, Blade must join forces with his most hated enemies or let humanity be destroyed. <br /> <br />\\"Blade 2\\" basically takes everything that was great about the first film, and improves upon it.  With the directing of Guillermo Del Toro and the terrific writing of David S. Goyer, the saga of Blade continues forward at break-neck speed.  Outstanding special effects that blow the first film away, and show a tremendous amount of imagination, \\"Blade 2\\" is a visual extravaganza.  Rarely does a sequel top its predecessor, but \\"Blade 2\\" succeeds in being the exception to the rule.  If you enjoyed \\"Blade\\", you will most definitely love \\"Blade 2\\", and just like \\"Blade\\", the ending leaves you just wanting more. <br /> <br />\\"Blade 2\\" is rated R for violence and language.

0780624890|4.0|The movies responsible for the rejuvenation of the comic book movie genre, are believed to be by most audiences, movies like \\"Spiderman\\" or \\"X-Men\\".  However, before either of those movies were released to theaters, let alone even being made, one comic book character managed to revive two genres, vampires and comic books, the character is Blade.  While many would probably disagree with me about the movie \\"Blade\\" being responsible for resurrecting the comic book movie genre, most view \\"Blade\\" as simply another horror movie about vampires.  Personally, I disagree with those people, because without the success of \\"Blade\\", \\"X-Men\\" would have probably not been made the same way.  What I mean by this is, \\"Blade\\" took a serious look at the subject matter, and treated it as if the story took place in our reality.  Since this film concept worked, Bryan Singer adapted the characters of the X-Men in a realistic fashion, thus giving audiences a more realistic superhero.  But, now is not the time to continue this debate for two reasons, one is that this debate could take a while, and second is because I'm supposed to be reviewing \\"Blade\\", and not debating it's impact on the current comic book movie craze. <br /> <br />\\"Blade\\" follows the story of vampire hunter Blade (Wesley Snipes), who is half human/half vampire.  Blade and his mentor/weapons maker, Whistler (Kris Kristofferson) spend their days hunting vampires, and searching for the vampire that bit Blade's mother.  They have been waging their war on the vampires for some time now, and most vampires fear the name Blade, all except for one, Deacon Frost (Stephen Dorff).  Deacon believes the key to defeating Blade is to unleash the blood god, La Magra.  To save humanity from Frost's evil plan, Blade must use all of his training and weapons, or humanity's day could be over. <br /> <br />Director Stephen Norrington has crafted a terrific mix of drama, action, and horror that makes for a great movie experience.  Wesley Snipes asBlade is perfect casting, as movie audiences discover a new kind of superhero, one who is more an anti-hero with a just cause.  The story is well paced by writer David S. Goyer (\\"The Crow: City of Angels\\"), and leaves audiences wanting more vampire hunting action.  The acting is very good, which was key to not only the success of this movie, but also to prove to movie studios that to make good horror movies or comic book movies, you must use A-list actors.  The special effects were good for the most part, the scene at the end when Deacon is cut in two and puts himself back together was kind of crappy, but for the most part they hold up well, and on a positive note the special effects were greatly improved for the 2 sequels that followed. <br /> <br />Overall, \\"Blade\\" is an excellent vampire movie, and a great comic book adaptation that managed to accomplish a rare feat in Hollywood, finding success in two genres with just one movie. <br /> <br />\\"Blade\\" is rated R for violence, language, and sensuality.

Just to give a point of reference my favorite artists at this point were Radiohead and Bjork. Let's just say Bjork got dethroned with ease! (although it's an unfair comparison really)    The Dreaming at first listen is very strange and to an extent even dissonant, but with repeated listens Kate's \\"method\\" becomes internalized and one has the distinct pleasure of finding such an ostensibly insane record intuitively engaging. This is faciliated by the fact that underneath it all these are just 10 very very well written songs, and so much more impressive since their stylistic medium is unlike anything that came before or has come since (which is why this album is still ahead of its time).     Kate has some other great albums that showcase her trajectory throughout several life stages and ultimately underscore her versatility and richness of personality (the first half of hounds of love is her other magnum opus, btw), but this stands alone above and beyond the rest of her catalogue as a musical anomaly.    I still can't believe how this album escapes widespread attention, being that it is a timeless masterpiece. Alongside KID A by Radiohead this is my favorite album of all time.
1932907009|5.0|SAVE THE CAT! isn't only for up-and-coming writers, professional screenwriters should read it too.  <br /> <br />In the seven years I was an executive at MGM, I read over three thousand screenplays and heard hundreds of pitches.  The vast majority would not pass Blake's basic criteria and I wish he'd written this book years ago!  If you want to sell your project to a studio, you must be able to describe the concept in a simple, concise and compelling way and SAVE THE CAT! provides a roadmap with clear directions. <br /> <br />Unlike the litany of screenwriting books that wax poetic about outdated theories but don't offer tangible advice that writers can use, Blake generously shares his tools and techniques for creating a saleable screenplay in today's competitive marketplace.  I cringe whenever I read or hear a screenwriting expert dictating a \\"cure-all\\" page-by-page structure or espousing a magic \\"formula.\\"  I was suspicious of the rules at first, but I found his Beat Sheet to be a very useful and instructive tool.  I now use it as a reference in the Feature Film Development class I teach at UCLA.  <br /> <br />I have given copies of SAVE THE CAT! to writers at all levels- from my students who are working on their first scripts to many of my Good in a Room consulting clients who have sold multiple screenplays and won Academy Awards.  If you have a movie idea and want to craft a well-structured screenplay, Blake Snyder's SAVE THE CAT! is a big step in the right direction. <br />

B000001FTD|5.0|As the above, editorial review notes, Metallica and Slayer invented thrash, but Anthrax are just as innovative, because they brought it to the east coast and added some punk touches/flavor to it. Plus, Joey Belladonna and Co. practically invented (or popularized) shout-along refrains. (Most every track on here has a shout along.) \\"Among the Living\\" is an \\"adrenaline pumping\\" album with exciting and contagious songs, which are full to the brim with circular, buzzsaw riffs, fast, thumping drums, beeping bass notes, catchy shout along choruses, energetic beats, and winding guitar solos. Plus, Joey chooses to actually sing (in addition to shout) in several places. Thus, songs like \\"I Am The Law\\" and \\"Indians\\" have a melodic edge, and show that Joey can really hold a note well. Other highlights include the album opening title track, \\"Caught In A Mosh,\\" the slower \\"A Skeleton In The Closet,\\" \\"One World\\" (which has a whiplash tempo change near the beginning), and, of course, my personal favorite \\"Efilnikcufecin (N.F.L.).\\" The bottom line is this is doubtlessly the best, catchiest, and most contagious album Anthrax ever released. It's absolutely essential for 1980's thrash fans, and I also recommend starting here if you're new to this band.
B00000055E|4.0|I would like to also point out to you that I have a broad taste in hip-hop, I do also like many of the rappers you point to, as do many Tupac fans, so maybe it is you that is ignorant. Biggie has an amazing flow, but his lyrics are average, and he never really raps about anything meaningful. Nas is, in my opinion the greatest lyricist ever, I love NWA as well, but none of them had the charisma and presence Tupac had. As for him contradicting himself, you don't think he noticed that? Everyone contradicts themselves, he wasn't afraid to show it either, because he said what was on his mind at the time. Have you ever listened to his lyrics, he genuinely believed that women should be treated with respect, yet on the other hand it conflicted with the one night stands he had (listen to Temptations on Me Against The World). He was the realest to ever pick up the mic, and not just that he was also a well above average lyricist, anyone who says otherwise is talking s**t. Buy Me Against The World and listen to him at his lyrical peak, he was not wack, I can only assume that you attack him because of what he said to Biggie. Get over it, the beef died when they both died, it was 9 years ago, I feel sorry for people like you who can't appreciate both of their music. this album isn't his best but is still a good one but needs some work.<br /><br />R.I.P. 2PAC
0307276902|4.0|A Million Little Pieces is the story of author James Frey's six weeks in a rehab program. He arrives at the treatment center completely broken, not just figuratively, but literally as well--his nose is broken, he is missing teeth, and there is a hole through one of his cheeks. On the one hand, Frey spares the reader no gory details, from his repeated descriptions of vomiting up blood and pieces of stomach daily to his complete account of having his teeth capped and replaced without the benefit of anesthesia. On the other hand, however, Frey never plays for sympathy, frequently reminding the reader (and himself) that he is a \\"Alcoholic, a Drug Addict, and a Criminal.\\" He freely paints a picture of himself that is completely despicable, and yet the reader can't help but root for him to succeed, to be one of the only 17% of addicts who are still sober a year after treatment.<br /><br />Although I found this book fascinating, I had a few problems with it as well. First of all, Frey's writing style--which included random capitalizations, no quotation marks, no paragraph breaks, no right justification, and long sequences of single lines going down the page--made the book very difficult to read. While I understand the apparent reason for this (ie, that the chaotic text was a reflection of Frey's chaotic life), it made me slogging through the book a chore and limited my reading of it to short sessions. Secondly, I felt that Frey left the reader hanging a bit with respect to both his own fate and the fate of those he met during his rehab stay. Although the final page of the book does offer brief updates on each of the major characters, I found this rather unfulfilling, as I wanted to know more, especially about Lilly. But again, I understood the reason for this, as the purpose of the book was to focus on Frey's time in rehab, not what happens after. However, I would definitely recommend this book as being an excellent treatise on the full horrors of drug addiction and recovery, keeping in mind that the extremely explicit nature of Frey's narrative may not be for everyone.ry, keeping in mind that the extremely explicit nature of Frey's narrative may not be for everyone.
B000BW7QWW|5.0|The first movie to come along in years that is truly quality.  Great story, characters, performances, effects, script, direction!!!!  YOU DON'T HAVE TO SEE FIREFLY TO UNDERSTAND AND LOVE THIS MOVIE.  I went into it without even knowing about Firefly and I loved it.  This story begs to be told in many more sequels!
B00009ATIX|4.0|Philosophical science fiction about a psychologist sent to rescue a corporation's research station lost in orbit of a mysterious planet named Solaris.  A security team previously dispatched has disappeared and the station's captain has requested Dr. Chris Kelvin (George Clooney) to help investigate strange events that have overcome the crew.  Dr. Kelvin arrives to find only two of the five crew members alive and in various states of paranoia.  They are unable to describe what is happening until Dr. Kelvin's wife -- dead for three years -- reappears at the station.  Dr. Kelvin is torn between his professional objectivity and love for his wife to resolve the situation.<br /><br />Solaris is a very thought-provoking feature that questions conventional thinking and beliefs about human existence.  The reappearance of Dr. Kelvin's wife -- Rheya (Natascha McElhone) -- is obviously due to the mysterious powers of Solaris, but Dr. Kelvin and the crew are unable to determine if she, and others who've appeared, are facsimiles or resurrections.  Rheya is disturbingly of flesh and blood; herself wondering what is happening.  The story keeps viewers guessing until the very end on what Dr. Kelvin will do, and even then leaves open questions on what happened.<br /><br />This is science fiction of earlier genre that is more philosophical than action adventure.  While the story's tempo moves slowly, it's an intriguing piece that breaks the bounds of conventional wisdom.  The actors are good, the special effects are understated but excellent, and the film's music soundtrack is magnetic.
B000A88EVE|4.0|Don't go into this movie with expectations--no matter what you expect, they'll all be let down.  Not a bad thing.  This movie is a spectacular assault on the senses.  I began watching it a long time ago as a 12-year-old, which was a mistake, and my mother (rightfully) made me turn it off.  When I saw the Criterion edition in my local store, pointed out to me by a fellow Bowie fanatic who knew I'd been wanting to see it all the way through, I knew I had to buy it. <br /> <br />We watched it right away.  Probably best to watch with a friend who's also in the mood for a movie like this (kind of artsy, an amazing visual feast to even the most discriminating of viewers).  Having another person to help you understand the confusing aspects is a good thing. <br /> <br />It's quite long, at just about 2.5 hours, but it was worth every moment.  I will grant that the plot is weak and there aren't many twists or anything to hold the attention of a very plot-driven viewer, hence my not-quite-perfect review, but this is a spectacular movie.  It may (read: will) take multiple viewings to understand it (despite being very simple, it is very deceptively so, and most viewers will look for much more than is there--it also helps to know the plot when you watch the beginning, so you don't sit there for 45 minutes going 'WTF?') and to see it all the way it should be seen. <br /> <br />I must say, though, that quite possibly the highlight, for a young Bowie fanatic who finds him the sexiest man on (or off, in this case) Earth, is the sexual nature of some of the scenes, including a fully nude Bowie, only slightly obstructed. <br /> <br />All in all, I would suggest renting before buying, but don't let your first viewing turn you totally off of this movie unless the thought of watching it a second time (perhaps a week or even a month later) makes you gag.
B000BJS4BM|5.0|I've been a fan of Madonna's for years.  This is the best cd she's put out in years.  This is a must own.
B000BW7QWW|5.0|I just have to say, biased though it may be, that this is an amazing movie, one of the best I've ever seen.  Now most movies don't have the Cinderella story that Serenity has behind them; most movies don't come out to the screaming of applause of tens of thousands of fans of a dead TV show.  Regardless, I saw this movie before I had seen any episodes of Firefly, and I walked out of the theatre thinking, \\"This is something special.\\"  If you see this movie before you see the series, as I did, it doesn't ruin the experience, but it definitely leaves you wanting to know more of the story behind the characters.  If you see the series first, then what are you doing reading a review!? Serenity is what you've been waiting for!
0740748475|5.0|I adored this comic strip as a \\"big kid\\" - it came out at the end of college.  My grammy and I always read it together and when we couldn't she would mail it to me.  So this collection brings back fond memories.  It is beautifully packaged and presented and each strip is lovely to look at.  Yes, it is heavy and clumsy because it is big but it more than makes up for it with how gorgeous the strips are and how it looks on the shelf.  Really worth getting if you can.
B000002UWP|4.0|Certainly this is a really strong album, but at 15 tracks it is just a little too long for my liking. I cannot see why 'soul deep', which was the first track of their first album is included here. It wasn't that strong a song anyway, and the album had 14 tracks, ample length without it. <br />I also dislike 'hotblooded', just not my sort of song. And 'Physical fascination' and 'knockin' on every door' are enjoyable filler. <br />The rest is pop genius. I think the ballads are absolutely beautiful. 'Spending my time' is an exceptional song. 'Things will never be the same' for me is even better, with an enchanting acoustic guitar intoduction. Also 'Do you get excited' has in my mind some nice synthesiser work, though others may feel it is dated. I remember hearing 'church of your heart' on the radio, it must have been- 1992? and it always filled me with a happy feeling, it is a lovely ballad. My favourite song is the closer 'the perfect day' beautiful, soft song with a complex vocal melody. Also look out for other ballads 'fading like a flower', which is fairly well known and rightly so, and 'watercolours in the rain' a nice acoustic guitar driven track, written by Marie. <br />If my memory serves me correctly, I think an ultra rare song of theirs called 'the sweet hello, the sad goodbye' was written around this time. This is, in my opinion the BEST Roxette song ever- it is absolutely incredible, yet it still remains available only as a b-side. Those that love Roxette are recommended to find this song fast- think it is on the b-side to one of the singles off here, and it also crops up maybe as the b-side to 'you don't understand me' or/and 'vulnerable'.
B000AP04FG|2.0|Definitely some nice chemistry between the stars and certainly some good dialogue but overall, an unfortunately boring movie. <br />There are one or two scenes that are well written, there is some cleverness in some scenes and Vince Vaughn is fun whenever he is on screen, but there's not a lot more to this movie. The entire movie is based on one premise, and the one unfortunate consequence of that premise. No side plots to entertain you or distract you. The boring and plodding dialogue far outweighs the witty dialogue. <br /> <br />Finally, just as I have no idea how to end this review, the writers had no idea how to end the movie.
B000BKVQTS|3.0|At their best, Terry Gilliam's films have a magical quality that transports the viewer to another world, one they may not entirely understand, but which has its own crazy through-the-looking-glass sort of logic. Time Bandits, the Adventures of Baron Munchausen and the Fisher King all have a fever-dream quality to them, where the viewer is swept along through strange, even sometimes nonsensical paths.<br /><br />The Brothers Grimm could have used more of this. There are nods in that direction, but ultimately, the film feels like a Hollywood action adventure. It's not quite as bloodless as Van Helsing, but it's cut from the same cloth. To get a film like this from Terry Gilliam is almost shocking.<br /><br />There's still plenty of whimsy and strangeness in the film -- the Italian torturer who shadows the Brothers Grimm or the involved 19th century special effects equipment used to create many of their tricks -- but it all feels very much like the film any other Hollywood creator would make. Maybe that's what Gilliam had to do for his career, after Don Quixote went off the rails as badly as it did. Even so, this film feels like an opportunity wasted.<br /><br />The world can use more of Gilliam's madness and whimsy. The Brothers Grimm, although it can be fun, doesn't answer much of that need.<br /><br />A recommended rental for fans of Terry Gilliam's work or adult fairy tale fans.
B0009FU0ZQ|4.0|I hate redundancy so I'll avoid providing background on the books and the character--I just want to add my voice to the chorus and say that Tom Selleck truly shines in this role.  Selleck is a natural as Jesse Stone.  In my mind he, much more than Robert Urich, fits the image of Robert B. Parker's wise guy protagonists.  I think he would make an excellent Spenser.  Selleck's has improved with age.  His rugged good looks and his delivery are absolutely flawless in this movie. <br /> <br />On the downside--I wasn't crazy about the scripting for Stone's \\"pal,\\" Abbie.  I'm not sure how her part compares with the book because even though I have read every book in the Spenser series (there are over 30), all the Sunny Randall books and the first three books in the Jesse Stone series, this book somehow slipped under my radar.  In the movie I found Abbie's wide-eyed amazement over the fact that Stone had actually killed someone and her constant refrain, \\"You know I am wiser than you\\" kind of irritating.  I also found the movie somewhat lacking in suspense. However, these deficits were outweighed by Selleck's performance because it was a genuine treat to see one of Parker's character's brought so sucessfully to life.
B00011CZRE|2.0|Whoever heard of a serial killer killing for the reasons given in this contrived flick? <br /> <br />No reason to blame the actors here; they didn't write it, they didn't direct it. <br /> <br />There is one great chase/fight sequence in the film, and the art direction is terrific...otherwise, this thing lacks plausibility. <br /> <br />Interested in seeing a great serial killer movie? See Maniac starring Joe Spinnel, or see Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer--or even Monster, starring Charlize Theron. <br /> <br />
B00005JM0B|2.0|This is the worst Terminator film out of the 3 to date, and the reason is, because it has no depth and is to predictable.  T2 was by far the best sequal of any film to date, the story was fresh and the special effects were refreshing.  T3 seems to be a desperate attempt to re-start the Terminator story, but it falls well short of expectations.  The film also has so many gaffs in it, you lose count.  Some of the acting is 3rd rate and the ending, whilst, is probably the its only plus point, does leave you wondering what is next.  But if it is as 3rd rate as this sequal, I doubt I will be wasting anytime in seeing it.  Incidentally, T3 is already in the discounts bins, and I think that speaks volumes.
B0002IVN9W|5.0|Most of the songs released nowdays, even the better stuff, try to get you right away with a catchy hook. The Arcade Fire has patience, and respect for the listener. Their songs take you on a journey. Parts of this album make you want to sit there and do nothing but just listen. Other parts make you want to dance around the house by yourself.  <br /> <br />This album is like a great novel, every time the last song ends I am sad that it's over. Deep, rich, and satisfying. <br /> <br />I'd rate it as one of the top 5 albums of the new millenium.
B000BW7QWW|5.0|Joss Whedon is a god when it comes to story writing and character development.  Serenity like all his other works does not disappoint.  With all the action and visual splendor that the movie entices viewers with, the true essence of the film lies with its characters.  The world that Whedon beautifully illustrates is one that speaks of truth and companionship.  In a not so distant chinese/western-esqe world, in the end, its the people that are around us that make what we fight for everyday worthwhile.  This is no \\"star wars\\" epic, nor does it need to be.  The movie allows first time followers of this world to be quickly drawn in without dragging it out for those longtime faithful.  The extra dvd features are great as well, but honestly, buy this dvd and realize what TRUE writing and film making are all about.  Join the browncoats and keep this ship flying <br /> <br />\\"I am a leaf on the wind....watch how i soar\\"
0345347951|4.0|Clarke, Arthur C. Childhood's End. New York, New York. 1954. 212 pages.   Childhood's End is a classic, extraordinary novel based upon the tensions caused by the Cold War. The novel, Childhood's End by Arthur C. Clarke, describes a world without war or aggression or identity. The Overlords are an alien race, who control Earth and establish a utopian society. Karellen, the leader of the Overlords of planet Earth, oversees that the mission is accomplished peacefully. Certain humans, such as Stormgren and Jan Rodricks, want to know more about the reason(s) behind the Overlords' ambitions and regulations of humans. Whether or not the Overlords are the \\"Devil\\" (63) or \\"working for a united world\\" (35) remains to be explained later on in the novel.   When reading the novel, I felt myself asking, \\"What's going on? How did that happen? I didn't see that coming.\\" The way it was written furthered my need to read on and find out. The storyline was so peculiar that I found myself paralyzed by the book, so to speak. Just wanting to figure out what was going to happen next. Clarke's way of writing keeps one's imagination running wild. In his writing, he develops a certain type of intellect between the conversations of the characters. \\"`All political problems,'\\" Karellen had once told Stormgren, \\"`can be solved by the correct application of power'\\" (62) and they would further express their knowledge and beliefs on the subject matter. The conversations added a sense of intellect during the read. I felt as though one was witnessing a conversation between philosophers and scholars.   A key to any novel is a fantastic storyline. As I had mentioned before, the storyline was peculiar but repetitive considering aliens arrive and control Earth. The way Clarke develops the storyline is different because instead of the aliens gaining control by brute force, they gain control by bringing \\"security, peace, and prosperity to the world\\" (9). The storyline has an out of the ordinary falling action toward the end of the novel. Arthur C. Clarke's storyline is unmatched for its creativity and well thought out execution.    If one does get around to reading this creative science fiction novel, they would be in for a treat. The way the book was written caused the novel to have an easy flowing way about it, yet it still had a well structured vocabulary. As with every book make sure to give it a chance and appreciate the writer's prolong. My suggestion to all readers who would be interested in reading this book is to appreciate the communication between the characters and maybe catch some hints along the way to better identify what will happen next.
0743454537|5.0|Anna, the novel's heroine was genetically engineered to be a donor match for her sister. During her entire existence she has donated blood, bone marrow, etc to sustain her sisters' life. When she is slated to be a kidney donor, she refuses and hires a lawyer to become medically emancipated.<br /><br />The book is written to show the various viewpoints of the books' characters. I enjoyed reading about Anna (a feisty, courageous, child), her siblings, parents and other minor characters. This was a book selected by our book club and the discussion created some very interesting points of view, especially where Sara (the mother) was concerned. The relationship between Anna and her attorney was also realistic and well written.<br /><br />I've read several reviewers mention they did not like the ending and I understand why, it is not what you expect. To me, the ending was almost right and it did take me by surprise. It was \\"real\\" and not a Hollywood fairy tale ending. Reminded me of the ending in that movie Seven with Brad Pitt. The ending was a shocker because it is what might have happened in real life, not the \\"happy\\" ending we expect when reading or watching a movie. There were definitely some tears shed reading this book and I highly recommend it.
B000BW7QWW|5.0|If only all sci-fi movies were this good. This movie has a great cast, a great plot, great humor and great action. <br />Both people who watched the TV show and those who have never heard of Serenity before should be able to enjoy this movie.
B00005JNTX|2.0|Maybe I missed something by not seeing this in the theater; maybe the living comic book visual style of SIN CITY was so dazzling on a big screen that it obliterated any reservations about the sheer banality of its storylines. But I finally got a chance to see this film, a joint effort of graphic novelist Frank Miller and film director Robert Rodriguez, and was frankly bored by it after about half an hour (and I think I'm being generous there!). All the storylines---Bruce Willis' attempt to protect a young stripper (Jessica Alba), Mickey Rourke's attempt to avenge a prostitute's (Jaime King) death, Clive Owen's attempt to put down a thug (Benicio del Toro) and his misogynistic ways---are done in a film noir style that is unfortunately ALL style. There's no psychological depth to any of the characters as there are in other comic book adaptations (BATMAN BEGINS is an exemplary recent example); it's all just a soulless geek show. A fantastic looking, often atmospheric geek show, but a geek show nevertheless. If appearances are all that matter to you, than SIN CITY will probably be a ball (and the visuals are the only reasons I'm giving the movie 2 stars instead of just 1). But for those looking for something other than just fancy-pants visuals in a comic book movie adaptation, look elsewhere.
B00000DC10|5.0|Nothing is more visceral and violent than this CD. Yeah, it will blow your speakers away, as well as your senses. This is the best mix of punk-jazz-hardcore-rock-techno that ever existed. This is awesome music by a now dead band. To hell with Metallica or whatever crap you listen to. The Refused came, destroyed and died. That's how a band like this should act.

B00008H2LB|1.0|I guess you can call this music.  Every song is the same, some Japanese dude rapping with some white clown screaming over the top of him.  Chester Copperpot needs to refine his skills so can be called a singer and not some buffoon.  The best song that LP has ever done is on the Matrix Reloaded soundtrack.  It's the best because there is NO singing on it.  No rap, which sucks anyway, and no screaming to hurt the ears.  Am glad MTV can promote this crap.  But, when some joke like Carson Daly brings the world Smashmouth, you can't expect much.
B00005JLEU|1.0|That anyone would let a child watch a movie that involves worshiping idols, definately not for Christian Familys!
B00009UW0N|5.0|By now, we should all be familiar with the story: young unknown director takes a nobody cast and a pathetically-low budget and creates a horror classic, a franchise which still manages to churn out product.<br /><br />This film really started it all, in terms of opening the way for the eighties \\"slasher flick\\"(jury is still out on whether this was a positive or negative development but anyways). Pay close attention to the real lack of gore in this one. Myers disposes his victims in almost bloodless fashion. Lack of gore, however, just increases the suspense, as the last scenes involving Laurie Strode, \\"The Shape,\\" and Inspector Loomis are about as terrifying as anything you'll ever see.<br /><br />A must-watch for anybody into the horror genre.
B000AYEL6U|5.0|I found out about this movie on this website searching for great period pieces, and preordered a copy before it was released (here in the US), based on the excellent reviews I read about. I never heard about it anywhere before. <br /> <br />Armed with all these superb reviews, it still did not prepare me for the absolute breathtaking performances I have ever seen. From the interaction between Margaret Hale & John Thornton, Margaret & Bessie Higgins, Mr Higgins & John, John & Hannah Thornton, Mr & Mrs Hale, to the very end, this story pulls at all the emotional strings one can ever imagine. The theme music finally brings everything to heart and long after the movie ends, i still sit frozen on the couch--spellbound. The ending is very satisfying and spellbinding. This is the best period piece movie I have ever had the pleasure of watching. Top notch perfomances from all the cast. This DVD is truely worth buying. I have watched it countless times!! <br /> <br />Thank you amazon.com for providing this website and all the information on good period pieces.  <br /> <br />

B000AADYRQ|5.0|I found Death Cab For Cutie this year for the first time. After buying Plans, I fell in love with them, and bought most of their old Albums. Their lyrics in this album are just amazing. Musically, it's very quiet, and relaxing. Lyrically, it makes you smile, and tugs at your heart strings. My favorites were Brothers On A Hotel Bed, Soul Meets Body, and I Will Follow You Into The Dark. My favorite CD of all time is the Garden State SDTRK, and I feel like DCFC's music belonged on that soundtrack. This CD is definitely worth the purchase.
0393035158|3.0|Even though some would believe that Buddhism is not a religion, I did find one online dictionary, \\"WordWeb,\\" which defines Buddhism as a \\"religion represented by the many groups (especially in Asia) that profess various forms of Buddhist doctrine and that venerate Buddha.\\" Harris certainly venerates Buddhism if not Buddha. It is contradictory to Atheism to \\"venerate\\" and make into a god an idea, person or thing. In addition, Atheism does not propose violence as a means of rectifying the issues that Harris proposes in his book. Mr. Harris is a Buddhist masquerading as an Atheist. This presents an interesting question: Will an appeal to Atheism become an emerging trend in the 21st century? And if so why? It is certainly a phenomenon worth watching. Imitation is the best form of flattery. Has Atheism come of age? If so, beware of fake Atheist. I would have given this book 5 stars if it were written by a \\"true non-believer.\\" If it were, it would have been more honest. Harris gets 4 stars for having the gall to masquerade as an Atheist, and for continuing the dialogue on the usefulness vs. uselessness of religion in a world where non-believers get tough criticism from the religious right.
B00005JO1Y|4.0|<br /> <br /> <br />Being someone whose been in family whose seen almost every \\"King Kong\\" carnation on film (From the original, the really bad, To \\"Mighty Joe Young\\" staring Bill Paxton, and the laughable 1970s remake starring Jeff Bridges among others), one would be safe to assume you've seen it all. . .  <br /> <br /> <br />But you haven't see a King Kong remake unless you seen Peter Jackson's remake of the 1933 Film. And what's great about this film is that all the characters (from the minor to the major) all have relationships with the other unlike old film and the remakes. I saw this movie on opening day, I came in on Jack Black's character trying to persuade his peers to allow him to direct a documentary film with the biggest star they could find (If memory serves). I wasn't expecting to be dazzled by the movie despite the director simply because of its Source material, but I got a real surprise out of this film entirely. Jack Black plays a convincing, manipulative director, Carl Denham who is accompanied along with his assistant Preston (Colin Hanks) - who is weary of Denham's idea to go ahead with a film his peers are obviously against. Along the way we are introduced to struggling \\"actress(?)\\" Ann Darrow (Naomi Watts) who is saved from potential jail time by Denham's quick acting and is then offered the chance of a lifetime to star in Denham's illegal docufilm. Using what means he can, he manages to get everything he needs abroad a ship, including playwright and long time friend Jack Driscoll (Adrien Brody) who to wrote him a script. When he only receives 14 pages Denham cunningly manages to keep Driscoll on the boat as it leaves.  <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />From there, several other characters aside from ill-judging Captain Eagelhorn (Thomas Kretschmann), such as likable character Mr. Hayes (Evan Parke), Mr. Hayes' charge and admirer Jimmy (Jamie Bell), Choy (Lobo Chan) and multitalented Andy Serkis as Lumpy the Cook and KING KONG himself are introduced.All of the actors show of their talent by bringing their characters to life. Even if it for brief moments on screen, its believable. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />The storyline revolving around Naomi's character Ann Darrow and King Kong was well thought out (another plus for me is that Kong didn't undress Ann Darrow like he did in the 1970s remake). The natives of the Skull Island were actually given some respect and an overall intelligent revamp from their 1933 counterparts. They were frightening natives with the means to capture Ann Darrow and serve her up to Kong, instead of impassively stupid natives dressed in hula dresses. Though they still retained their \\"black as the hinges of hell\\" complexion. Another plus is only one of them is killed. The character development was nicely placed in the movie, each of the characters that survive are completely different from they were at the beginning of the movie. The length of the movie is understandable if anything; King Kong would've been rather disappointing if it had been narrowed down to two hours and they tried to cram all of the stuff that had in the movie over that running time. The film pulls you into moments of clam or relaxation and comes out of nowhere with moments that make you jump. The Score done by James Newton Howard (\\"ER\\" theme guy) give scenes in the movie well deserved atmosphere but you'll be hard pressed to notice there's music in the background for you'll be too engrossed in the action taking place on the screen to notice. <br /> <br /> <br />The movie's CGI is also a splendor to behold in and of itself. The animation is excellently blended into the film. King Kong himself is realistically animated by Serkis who is widely known by LOTR fans for bringing the fallen character Gollum/Semeagol to life in the all three award winning movies. He moved and behaved exactly like a Silver back Gorilla would. Just little details in Kong's behavior made you believe he was a real creature and not a CGI character. The use animal-inspired prehistoric creatures on Skull Island, designed after Dougal Dixon's work were realistically brought to life on screen with the scary realism of what you'd think dinosaurs and insects would act like on an island untouched my mankind's machines and industry. The Spider-Pit scene wasn't as creepy as I initially thought it would be but it was convincing nonetheless with the giant leeches and other insects. <br /> <br /> <br />All in all KING KONG gets the props he deserves in Peter Jackson's remake Its a highly enjoyable movie worth owning on DVD when its released. ---- [a 4 out of 5]
B00005JNQA|2.0|My suspicion that this film was mainly a \\"rah rah\\" piece for the U.N. is shared by several of my fellow reviewers.  I hope that is the case so any who put work into \\"The Interpreter\\" can say they at least accomplished something.  A really good spy thriller will maintain a nagging sense in the back of your mind that there is something amiss but keeps the action coming so you won't have an idle moment to ponder it.  At the very end, the final piece of the puzzle will drop into place just in time to roll credits.<br /><br />In this movie, that nagging detail is so glaringly obvious that a non-stop chase scene couldn't mask it and there are no chase scenes in this movie worthy of the name.  Staggering coincidences are required every few minutes to keep the plot moving.  When the details of the nefarious conspiracy are revealed, the viewer is left thinking \\"really, that's it? They went to all that trouble for that?\\"
0156027321|3.0|Although this book has been reviewed to death, let me add my two cents. <br /> <br />This book, eventually, supposedly, was supposed to be about religion, life, death, and life's meaning, and it is, for the first one hundred pages.  Then the story derails somewhere in the middle of the ocean, and this reader starts to fall asleep.  What a tragedy, because it's well written, and the author does graze the target of life's meaning.  Shorten this book by about a third, and you have a five star novel. <br />Also - if you are big into magical realism (i.e. a tiger and a guy on a boat for a looooooooong time) you'll probably get more out of this story.  Not bad, but there are better novels.
B00007ELEL|5.0|The more I see this movie the better it gets. Like all the Coen movies the story is so witty and funny and so rich that watching it once is just not enough. <br /> <br />Jeff Bridges is an actor I usually don't appreciate too much but he is absolutely brilliant as The Dude, a man who gets into a mix of circumstances because someone peed on his rug. And that rug really tied the room together. He is lazy, walks around in his underwear smoking pot and spends most of his time bowling. <br /> <br />His friends are Steve Buscemi (who contrary to Fargo has to shut up all the time now) and John Goodman. He plays a psycho, Vietnam vet who converted to judaism. He thinks he knows everything and tries to helps The Dude to get his rug back. <br /> <br />It's definitely up there with Fargo and O Brother Where Aret Thou, other Coen movies. The situations are funny and weird and the acting is so good. The choise of 'real' actors instead of comedians surely helps in that. <br /> <br />I also have to mention the brilliant choice of music. Every scene that has music is tied to the particular song. <br /> <br />Excellent.
B000B8QEZG|5.0|My goal here is to give a heart-felt, introspective, and honest review of this album, despite what I perceive as Madonna's indifference to those who made her famous:  her fans.  <br /> <br />While my political ideologies differ completely from Madonna, she has the right to say whatever she pleases.  She can hate our President, the war, etc.  We each have our own opinions.   <br /> <br />What I found most hurtful, however, and which caused me to make a vow to myself to never purchase another Madonna album (Ray of Light being my last), was when she stuck up her middle finger for all of the world to see and stated, \\"F*** the American Dream.\\"  Such a statement was a personal affront to me, since I was a part of that American Dream, a dream without which she would be nothing. <br /> <br />She may be married to a European and she may reside in London, but she should never forget where she came from.  Had I not received this album as a gift, I would have never purchased it. <br /> <br />Having said all of this, I think the album is absolutely fabulous!  Hands down, I give it five stars.  From beginning to end, it's terrific. <br /> <br />The song that stands out the most to me, however, is \\"Isaac.\\"  This seems to be an extension of the Middle Eastern influence as previously reflected in the song entitled \\"Frozen,\\" and I would really love to see Madonna run with this.  Sarah Brightman did this with her album, \\"Harem,\\" which includes a song entitled, \\"The War Is Over Now,\\" featuring an Iraqi singer.  I would highly recommend the album to anyone, along with the corresponding non-concert/Videos DVD. <br /> <br />Simply put, Madonna, from the beginning, has had a substantial impact on all of our lives.  She can choose to be a motivator, an icon, and an idol; or she can continue down the path of political ideology, which spews hatred towards those who made her famous. <br /> <br />I sincerely hope she chooses the former. <br />
B000B8QEZG|1.0|Her worst CD yet. Madonna has lost it - she lacks any voice control.  Each track sounds as if it has been put though a sound machine.  Thankfully she is living in London so we don't have to hear about her so often - too bad we still have to listen to her.
0393327655|5.0|This book is about faith versus rationale thought as well as the threat of indoctrination and authoritarianism to a free society.  His message is that organized religion - when followed literally and unrestrained by common sense and basic humanity - can result in horrors such as genocide.  He says that in order for us to live together in peace, the Christians and Muslims must ignore large portions of the Bible and the Koran, since both literally require the extermination of the other.  For example, he points out where the bible says that if your children do not follow your religion, you must kill them.  He makes some excellent points, although I would have liked him to go into greater detail on the origins of the bible.  (See the recommendation for the Ken Davis book below) <br /> <br />He includes the Nazism, Maoism, and other mass genocidal movements as \\"faiths\\".  He does get a little tricky here, since most people think of \\"faith\\" in terms of organized religion.  However, by faith he seems to mean social organizations - be they religious, political, or a cults of personality - whereby the followers are required to turn off their thinking and questioning capacity and accept and obey a doctrine on \\"faith\\".  Authoritarian regimes - religious or otherwise - have enough in common that I can accept this inclusive categorization. <br /> <br />I thought this book did a real service.  We all need to be reminded from time-to-time of the countless evils done in the name of religion, such as the inquisition, the burning of heretics and witches, the suicide bombings of Muslims and so on.  We also need to be aware that certain religions are anti-progress and anti-science, and have the capacity to stifle innovation and the free thought necessary to better our lives.   The fact that Galileo was not absolved of heresy until 1992 is only a small part of the issue.  Through most of history, science and questioning were viewed as a serious threat by the religious powers, which Harris brings out convincingly. <br /> <br />On the other hand, Harris does throw out the baby with the bath water.  One does not have to disavow science and kill one's neighbors to believe in a higher being.  The wonderful things done by religious groups of all types should get a little credit.  Feeding the poor, charities of all types, comforting the grieving, - these are no small matters to be dismissed lightly.  Was Jesus concerned with attacking science, or promoting a system of treating one another better?   <br /> <br />I have to give this five stars, because of the importance of his message and the need for all of us to engage in some questioning - of ourselves, of authority, of what we believe and why.  His point that evil practices - such as killing your sister for being raped  - are being given a free pass in the name of religious freedom is alone worth five stars.  That being said, I also agree with some of the reviewers who gave this book a bad rating because of his advocating torture, his quickness to excuse some evil acts because of good intentions and so on.  Also, this book doesn't entirely work on a stand-alone basis.  I would recommend other readings, such as How the Mind Works by Stephen Pinker;  Don't Know Much About the Bible, by Ken Davis; and The Wealth and Poverty of Nations by David Landes - to fill in the gaps. <br />

B0000AKCLS|5.0|Joe Bonamassa is about the only young white blues-based artist that recorded an album in the year 2003 that was a true tribute to the 100th birthday of blues music. This guy is amazing! If you like ultra-soulful, smoking blues, look no further than this album. Joe picks up where Kenny Wayne Shepherd left off in 1999 and takes it to newer heights. He can also shred like a mother when he feels like it, and his volume knob tricks are straight out of the Walter Trout trick book. And he's a great singer! Joe is the blues-rock savior of the world! Buy this and the rest of his catalogue--you won't regret it!!!!
B00006I53S|5.0|I bought this lens for my Canon 20D digital camera and have found it to be a great all-purpose, everyday-use lens.  Here are the best features from my perspective:<br /><br />1.  The range of telephoto zoom is adequate for 90% of photo opportunites.  28-135 mm telephoto in digital photography translates into 48-230 mm in SLR film photography.  Since a standard camera lens is 50-55 mm, the starting range of this zoom lens equals that and then has the added versatility of zooming up to 135 mm (or 230mm in old style camera figures).  In my opinion, this added range of framing a shot gives the photographer so much more creativity, as well as being able to bring objects into closer, more intimate range.  I mentioned that this lens is good for 90% of all general camera shots; the missing 10% are those pictures that require a better zoom (more telephoto zoom), and those pics that need a wider field of view.  You may find that for group photos in close proximity, you want to take a step backwards to get everybody in the frame.  This is not a problem unless you simply don't have the room to take that step back.  I solved this problem by switching back to the original 18-55mm lens that came with the camera.  For the more distant shots that can't be drawn into the 135mm zoom of this lens I purchased a better telephoto zoom.<br /><br />2.  The lens has autofocus and IS stabilization technology.  For one used to manual focus lenses in SLR film photography, the addition of a fast autofocus lens is a terrific feature! I used to miss those spur of the moment shots because I was trying to achieve focus.  With this lens, you make those shots, because within a milisecond of depressing the shutter down halfway, the picture snaps into focus!  I absolutely love this feature!  The focuser has many points of potential focus, so it adapts easily to virtually all focusing situations.  For the really difficult focusing shots, there is the option of manual focusing.  While nice to have, I rarely use this option.  The Image Stabilization feature is a handy one in the longer shots.  \\"IS\\" lets one get away with a bit of camera shake without too much out-of-focus smear on the picture.  Canon does not recommend using the IS feature on tripod shots, so there is a switch to turn off the IS if desired.<br /><br />3.  The lens takes sharp clear pictures.  I have not been disappointed with the quality of the lens at all.<br /><br />Drawbacks<br /><br />1.  While there are not too many drawbacks to this lens, I think the major one is that the lens is bigger and heavier, in fact, much bigger and heavier than the standard 17-55 mm lenses that come with SLR cameras.  For me this is not a problem, however, for one that wants to have a lighter-weight camera, this could be considered a serious drawback.  On the other hand, a SLR camera like the Canon 20D or digital Rebel is not designed to be a smaller pocket-sized camera.  It is a larger format camera and of course the lenses will be larger (and heavier) as well.<br /><br />2.  Cost.  At just over 400 dollars, this lens is an investment.  Again, one has to weigh the obvious financial outlay, but the 28-135 mm lens is so superior to the cheaper 18-55 mm lens, that in my opinion, it is well worth the cost to upgrade.<br /><br />With this product, Canon made a great everyday camera lens.  From my perspective, the advantages far outweigh the disadvantages and I do recommend this lens to be your everyday standard camera lens.<br /><br />Jim \\"Konedog\\" Koenighis option.

B000002L75|5.0|\\"Some Great Reward\\", Depeche Mode's 1985 release, finds the groundbreaking quartet continuing in the direction they began with \\"Construction Time Again\\", their previous offering. The direction is distinctly dystopian, and the songs often offer bitter humor and hedonism as the only comfort in a disconnected post-industrial world. Opening with a hymn to boredom, \\"Something To Do\\", \\"Some Great Reward\\" displays from the get go a more aggressive sound than on \\"Construction\\", and Alan Wilder's influence is more pronounced and assured. \\"Lie To Me\\" continues the cynical journey as David Gahan intones \\"Come on and lay with me/come on and lie to me\\"; again alienation and pleasure co-existing. This theme predominates \\"Some Great Reward\\" and creates a landscape grim but oddly seductive. \\"People Are People\\" is up next, which turns the mood to sad resignation. It became a breakthrough song for the band, and showcases the splendidly evolving industrial undercurrents of sound; rattles, metallic shimmers etc. that are the hallmark of this album. There are two outright love songs on \\"Some Great Reward\\", the first being \\"It Doesn't Matter\\" which is an oddly touching paeon to non-commital love i.e. \\"I know somewhere you are dreaming/but it's definitely not of me.\\" The tune is lovely and the scoring spare and undulating. The second is the more well-known \\"Somebody\\", a well-loved, more straightforward ballad whose lyrics only veer from treacly by virtue of the wink and nod line at the end: \\"Things like this make me sick/in a case like this I'll get away with it\\". The two least known tunes on \\"Some Great Reward\\" are \\"Stories of Old\\" and \\"If You Want\\". and they prove what a strong effort the album is. They are not at all throw aways; \\"Stories of Old\\" is erotic and musically inventive, while \\"If You Want\\" is Alan Wilder's almost middle eastern techno romp. \\"Master and Servant\\" is another DM concert and club staple, extolling the virtues of S&M. It is the most evocative of the era, and so perhaps the most dated. Not so with the magnificently dark closer, \\"Blasphemous Rumours\\", which still sounds fresh and sinister. The machine sounds still conjure an ominous creepiness, and the lyrics, though a bit overwrought, still work the nerves, and have a caustic wit. It brilliantly ends \\"Some Great Reward\\" in tone, and seemlessly sets up Depeche Mode's next, even darker release, 1986's \\"Black Celebration\\". If you're unfamiliar with pre-\\"Violator\\" Depeche Mode, do yourself a favor and pick up all four mid-80's masterworks by a band that defies comparison. They mark a creative pinnacle achieved by a very few.
B000BJS4SU|4.0|Listen, there is PLENTY of redundant, non-original, garbage heap, middle of the road, heavy rock-I wanna sound like somebody else crap out there in the popular music spectrum today.  I used to think John Mayer was one of those when I first heard '..Wonderland\\" single (although I thought it was extremely clever songwriting).  However, the great thing about this young artist is that the more you listen, the more talent you see.   <br /> <br />This new set 'Try' sounds to me like a milestone for a very talented guy, who wants to make sure he's not lumped in with the other trash out there and that people get a chance to hear all he's got to play.   <br /> <br />I'll admit not all of it is that original (I mean, he's definately paying some homage to some influences, without a doubt), but take a track like 'Good Love is on the Way' - that's a GREAT rock track with a fresh sound from all the redundant crap you hear today (you know what I'm talking about)! And it jams! <br /> <br />This is a disc worth buying - even better, check the Trio out live and bootleg your own personal version...
B00005MAM2|1.0|I am really stumped why people like this anime. In my personal opinion it was stupid, confusing and a waste of my time and I love anime. Though this just didn't appeal to me at all. The guy getting really big and exploding was disgusting. I mean maybe it's just me, I am not use to this old school anime. My animes are inuyasha, fruits basket, DN angel, and vampire princess miyu. I like more love stories and fantasy so if you're like me I would't even rent this anime though if you love sci-fic and confusing stuff, you'll love this one. Not for me though.

B000000OU6|4.0|\\"It's Five O'Clock Somewhere\\"(1995).Slash's Snakepit's first album.    By the time the mid 1990's had arrived,even though Slash had pretty much proven himself to be the Eddie Van Halen of the late 80's and early 90's,things were not going well for him. While Guns N' Roses had done a great job at letting Slash become so famous,GN'R was quickly falling into seclusion,leaving Slash with very little to do. However,after Slash had recruited three of his former Guns N' Roses band members(Gilby Clarke,Matt Sorum,and Dizzy Reed),along with vocalist Eric Dover and Alice in Chains bassist Mike Inez,his first post Guns N' Roses band(Slash's Snakepit)released their first record,entitled \\"It's Five O' Clock Somewhere\\". How did the CD meausure up? Read on for my review of this:    This album,while it may not be \\"Appetite For Destruction\\",is very easily the best album any member of Guns N' Roses released after leaving GN'R. It is an album consisted of blues music and a little bit of 80's and 90's rock,and when it was released,it did a good job at showing how good Slash could sound when he wasn't doing Guns N' Roses projects. This CD's opening track,\\"Neither Can I\\",does a great job at starting off slow and then getting really hard and suspenseful from beginning to end,\\"Beggers and Hangers-On\\" has a great Western sounding intro to it and does a good job at being a little bit \\"moody\\" during it's running time of lyrics,music,and singing,and there are several other fine moments on this record. I won't give away of all of them,but \\"Good To Be Alive\\",\\"What Do You Want To Be\\",and \\"Doin' Fine\\" are good,feel good hard rock songs,\\"Take It Away\\" is a nice,\\"suspenseful\\" ballad,while this album's closing track,\\"Back and Forth Again\\",has really nice melodies to it and is a good way to close an album. Slash's guitar solos on this CD sound both blues and rock influenced and really good,and that,along with the great songwriting on this record,is what makes this album so good. It really is a shame that the material on here was never used for a Guns N' Roses album(note that the material on here was actually going to be on what was supposed to be Guns N' Roses' last studio album until Slash had a fight with Axl Rose,which resulted in GN'R not using the material on this CD),as it would have helped GN'R make a comeback from their dreaded and infamous punk rock cover album(\\"The Spaghetti Incident\\"?)and given GN'R a new sound as well,which would have been a really good thing. Eric Dover's vocals on this record sound great,and Dover,along with Mike Inez,did a good job at helping Slash form sort of a new Guns N' Roses with a different band name,considering the fact that everyone from the line-up of Guns N' Roses on \\"The Spaghetti Incident?\\" is on this CD,with the exceptions of Axl Rose and Duff McKagan.    If you are a fan of Guns N' Roses and happen to really like Slash's guitar playing and songwriting,this CD is a must have. It was cool to see Slash do his own project aside from Guns N' Roses,and it is a shame that Slash's Snakepit are no longer around these days. In other words,if you like blues music,80's/90's rock,and Guns N' Roses,you are at the right location.
0446310786|5.0|I read 'To Kill a Mockingbird' when I was thirteen and, evidently, too young to appreciate it very much. But now that I've read it again at the age of twenty, I can see why my English teacher wanted his class to read it so badly. This book is full of wisdom and tolerance far before its time, and has detailed, colorful characters. Sure, the movie's good, and Gregory Peck does make a wonderful Atticus, but you'll never know what a truly unforgettable character Atticus really is unless you read the book. Because Atticus Finch IS the heart of the book.
B000BCKFWK|5.0|With some 600 reviews extant, I have no idea why I was sent a free copy of this to review, but I have to admit I'm genuinely happy that someone out there likes me.  The subject of this two-disk + graphic novel extravaganza is a film that dramatizes the Sin City graphic novel series written and drawn by Frank Miller.  Miller's storylines are archetypical noir set in a city where it is always night, and the darkest night at that.  People just plain don't come to good ends in Miller's work.<br /><br />The original release weaves four different Miller stores.  The Hard Goodbye is the story of Marv (Mickey Rourke), a not-quite-borderline psychotic, who finds a moment of love only to have the woman killed as she sleeps next to him.  Revenge is slow in coming and not the least bit sweet.  Then there is a tale about Hartigan (Bruce Willis), an ex-cop who takes on a child killer and goes to prison for it.  Years later he gets to wrap up the grim loose ends.  The Big Fat Kill finds Dwight (Clive Owen) pitted against a crooked cop (Benicio del Toro) who doesn't know how to stay dead.  Next thing you know all the women of Old Town are in a war. And The Customer Is Always Right is a short that offers little explanation but somehow brings the story together.<br /><br />Robert Rodriguez's direction is brilliant.  Rather than remake Miller's artwork, he sets out to match it stroke for stroke.  This is one of those rare films where an adaptation of an artist's work is the next best thing.  Deft use of black and white with vivid splashes of color, capture the original's intensity, the framing and scene setting are inspired, and the casting is outstanding.  Even if you are put off by all the violence, sex, and harsh language, you will have to admit that as a piece of film work, Rodriguez has recreated Sin City perfectly.<br /><br />I prefer the original film to the recut and extended version though.  The original interweaves the stories, which gives the view not only a better sense of timing, but also highlights the connections between the stories.  In the newer version you experience the stories one at a time, and while this may make things easier to follow, the common threads in this film about the price of vengeance in a lonely world don't come through as effectively.  The interviews, commentary, and other extras are quite good, though, so this is definitely the version to buy.nse of timing, but also highlights the connections between the stories.

B000056JYB|4.0|While the only officially released Blind Faith album remains as the slightly flawed '60s super group gem that it has always been, the rest of this double-disc set is really uneven. As others have pointed out, the actual songs and outtakes are quite good, but the jams had me wondering what was going on. Clapton, especially, sounds somnambulent, with virtually no creative spark or fire in his playing at all. That isn't the case with the solos in the originally released material, so, what gives? Is there better stuff as yet unreleased? Frankly, a compilation of some of the better bootlegged recordings readily available on eBay would have been far more preferable for completists - some of it was obviously recorded from a sound source close to the stage, so cleaning it up would not have been that difficult. Oh, well...perhaps some other time.
B000069KE0|5.0|Normally, \\"supergroups\\" consist of ex-members of previously famous bands, but Chicago a fresh group, easily to be considered a \\"supergroup\\". The joyful \\"Movin' In\\" is a wonderful soul piece with excellent solos by each of the individual brass instruments in the band. \\"The Road\\" is a light, bouncy piece which is lovely when the singer and guitarist play the same thing at the same time.  The darker yet beautiful piece \\"Poem for the People\\" is a moving addition.  Beyond the obvious hits, my outright favorite song on the album is the follower, \\"In the Country\\". Clocking in at over six minutes, it is a highly addictive love song with a sweeping chorus that is impossible not to sing out loud.  An appropriate follow-up to the previous work, \\"Wake Up Sunshine\\" is a great song that, like it's predecessor, has trading off vocal duties between Peter and Terry. The next seven tracks once and for all declare James Pankow one of the greatest songwriters of the century. The \\"Ballet for a Girl in Buchannon\\" was written by the trombone player as one 15 minute piece of music, but was broken up into movements on the suggestion of the producer. Thus, \\"Make Me Smile\\", \\"Colour My World\\", and \\"25 or 6 to 4\\" were born, three of the septet's most memorable tracks. The next four songs are pleasantly light little pieces that showcase the band's founder, Walt Parazaider,'s flute playing. Then, the group lets all the angry feelings loose on the anti-war five-piece work \\"It Better End Soon\\", which is closed by the lead singer's writing debut, \\"Where Do We Go from Here\\", a considerably more positive tune in comparison to the rest of the movements in the piece. The bonus selections are obvious, and nothing gets better than the single versions of \\"Make Me Smile\\" and \\"25 or 6 to 4\\". This second album from a legendary group is truly an enduring masterpiece.
B000001FOS|3.0|Malmsteen is great! Again, not all that on this album because of the sound. Joe Lynn Turner is a legend himself but only fit for Blackmore. After the \\"Marching Out\\" album, Polydor had some real crappy recording production: 2 of the most unsatisfactory recorded albums (this and \\"Eclipse\\") to mark Yngwie's resume. Besides the terrible washed out sound recorded, the only worthwhile enjoyment are the 2 tracks \\"Rising Force\\" and \\"Krakatau\\".

B000BW7QWW|5.0|When the Sci Fi Channel here in the United States started showing Firefly, the cancelled TV series that lasted one season, in preperation for the new film Serenity, I decided to watch. The movie looked interesting enough from the trailers, and I didn't want to miss anything due to not watching the show. Not only did I discover an amazing new show, I saw Serenity with my non-Firefly watching friend, and I enjoyed it- my beloved crew was back for what seemed like an extra long episode of Firefly. Best of all, my friend declared it awesome and was able to understand it without ever having to watch Firefly. How does Joss Whedon do that? <br /> <br />Serenity is an amazing film. I could have understood it without watching any Firefly, and it's more than the general action science fiction film. Anyone who's seen the trailer can see plenty of firepower, but you'd have to see the movie to see there's much more to it. It's extremely well-acted, especially by Summer Glau as River Tam. River is a psychic, but this is no crystal ball and funky turban steryotype. River is, as her brother puts it, a mentally traumatized seventeen year old girl. She obviously, without her drug-induced condition, would be just like any other seventeen year old girl- messing around with her brother Simon and seeing movies instead of being the main character of them. She wouldn't be a fugitive on the crew of the Serenity, with smugglers, a mercenary, and ex-soldiers on the losing side of the war that shaped all the characters.  <br /> <br />River is obviously the most interesting, but everyone else brings their own dimension to the film- and it works. There's the captain, Mal, an ex-soldier, his first mate Zoe, the pilot Wash (also Zoe's husband), River and Simon, the fugitives from the government, Kaylee, the ship's mechanic, and Jayne, the mercenary. Mal is a Han Solo figure, Jayne is tough, and Kaylee is always happy- they work so well together. I doubt it would have worked without Firefly behindit (what's better than a whole year to develop your characters?), but here it does, and it's a rare blend. <br /> <br />Any more about the plot I'd likely spoil, but Serenity is one of the best movies I've seen. It's a shame it didn't do as well as it could have, but it's still an amazing film that's definitely worth your time. So is Firefly, by the way...you'll want to see it after Serenity if you haven't already.
B000007O9L|5.0|While the Stones have excelled often in the studio and their live shows are platinum entertainment events, the musical quality of their live performances has been spotty over the years, the demands of musicianship often being subservient to the controlled chaos and subpar sound quality of arena rock.  While the Stones have released lots of live performances, only two of these albums are among their greatest: Get Your Yayas Out, which captured the extraordinary addition of Mick Taylor to the lineup after Brian Jones' death, and Stripped, which has the purity, clarity, emotion and musicianship of these artists at their very best.  The tunes span the Stones' full career, but every version of these classics is a rediscovery and reinvention, with the band almost giddy at what they are spinning out.  This album is well worth the listen.
B00005JO1Y|1.0|The one star is for the special effects and the sets...the acting was abysmal! I'm a Jack Black fan, but this was the biggest casting mistake I've ever seen. Adrian Brody seemed like he'd rather be back in Dresden, and although Naomi Watts showed some flashes and looked like she was ready to do some real acting at a moment's notice, she eventually succumbed to poor writing and directing. <br /> <br />After a solid hour of tedious and unsuccessful character development, this indulgent movie spent another hour trying to decide if it was Jurassic Park or Lord of the Rings. Even the spectacular climax, with its peerless and amazing animation, became so dragged-out that by the time the beast was done in by the beauty, boredom had killed the movie.
B000002KHH|5.0|Anyone into rock knows about Paranoid. It's the album that helped Black Sabbath get so famous. The first album (self titled, \\"Black Sabbath\\") paved the way for Sabbath's overall success. This album certainly does that. <br /> <br />The album opens with \\"War Pigs\\". The song sounds to me like a war protest (with lyrics like \\"Politicians hide themselves away, they only started the war.\\" and \\"Why should they go out to fight? They leave that all to the poor.\\"). The song stretches for almost eight whole minutes, but it never gets too boring or repetitive as (in many Black Sabbath songs) it is made up of multiple different riffs. Next on the album is the title track, \\"Paranoid\\". You may have heard the story behind this song. It was written when the band needed one more song to go on the album, and it was completed in about 15 minutes. The song is somewhat short, only about 3 minutes. It has a very simple riff with catchy lyrics; the supposed album filler became one rock music's greatest accomplishments, being covered by bands such as Megadeth and a concert staple for both Black Sabbath and Ozzy Osbourne (during his solo career). The next song (\\"Planet Caravan\\") I never really listen to, I just see it as an album filler. It has incredibly slow lyrics and strange bongo sounding drums. That brings us to \\"Iron Man\\". One of the most ingenious, yet simple riffs ever devised, \\"Iron Man\\" is one of Sabbath's best. Great guitar work by Iommi, and Osbourne's melancholy vocals were made for this song. Bizzare lyrics about an apocalypse by a man made of iron (thus the title). \\"Electric Funeral\\" comes next on the track list, an interesting riff with even more interesting lyrics. \\"Hand of Doom\\" is an excellent track about the consequences of drug abuse. Starts with a slow, calm bass line, but picks up to bone-crushing guitar riffs, and some great drumming by Ward. \\"Rat Salad\\" is an instrumental song that showcases Ward's drumming ability with a minute or so drum solo. The final track onthe album \\"Faeries Wear Boots\\" is a strange song indeed. Starting with a very cool riff, then, in typical Sabbath fashion, becomes good and heavy. <br /> <br />In short this is one of the most important albums in rock history, if you enjoy hard rock, this is a must own. If you don't like Black Sabbath, at least give them the respect they deserve for everything they've done for the music industry.
B000BW7QWW|5.0|I love this movie.   <br /> <br />I won't take up space with repeating the plot details or praise for the writing, acting, sets, costumes, or effects.   <br /> <br />I'm just a regular gal, okay, a regular middle-aged gal, who got bit by the Firefly bug when it was first on TV on Friday nights.   <br /> <br />I don't have to explain to fellow fans, but if somehow, you've never heard of Firefly or Serenity, and are trying to decide if this is worth a few hours of your life, I heartily endorse it.   <br /> <br />Let yourself drift into that willing suspension of disbelief state of mind that true movie lovers embrace, and join the 'verse that Joss Whedon dreamed up to share with us.
B0002Z1EG2|5.0|This is one of my favorite CD's. If you're not sure if you really want to buy it, you defenitly should.
1401307450|5.0|This book is awesome!! From his early childhood through the highs and lows of his carrer, one cannot help being captivated by Anthony. <br />  His \\"adventures\\" are extremely fun and exciting. <br />  This book is happy, sad, rocking and touching! <br /> <br />5 stars!
0061020710|5.0|Fantastic! Can't wait to read all the others in the series.
B0006Z2LH4|4.0|I didn't realise that there had been other \\"Cube\\" films (for which this is apparently a sequel.) I suppose it could be written off as a taught, tense slasher film depicting a sadistic police state in our near future. Or is it an allegory for something else?<br /><br />Perhaps because I had no preconceptions from the earlier films I saw something else. The Cube is an allegory for earthly existance. The first tip was the wiping of memory before being placed in the great sadistic puzzle. Is not our memory of previous existance wiped clean before our incarnation in flesh on earth? Take a look at the nature of the Cube as a series of arduous, painful, even fatal traps that the inmates struggle through. Those that survive do so through teamwork and concern for their fellows. Heroic sacrifice and risk taking is generally rewarded. It is those who show little or no concern for their fellows who meet bad ends. Even the \\"techs\\" correspond to those individuals who think that by serving the evil, sadistic powers-that-be that they will be rewarded and protected- when the truth is that they are merely tolerated as long as they are useful- afterwhich they will be fed to the Cube themselves. As for the masters- they are clearly demonic and take great pleasure from their job of running the Cube. They are the Princes of the Earth- masters of the great machine of trial by suffering and hard choices. Yet, they are also capable of breaking the rules- until an even higher power calls them to task.<br /><br />Finally, what is the last answer to be given if one makes it to the Exit? It is, \\"Do you believe in God?\\"<br /><br />As for the ending, I won't reveal it. But maybe, just maybe, it was a judgement on one who did the right thing, but relied too much on pride in his own intellect and ability instead of the gods. That gives it the final taste of a Greek tragedy.
B000001GQP|5.0|yES, i OWN THIS PIECE OF ART, THATS ALL I CAN SAY HERE.
0553801503|4.0|I remember pre-ordering A Feast for Crows when it first appeared on Amazon in 2002.   Needless to say, I cancelled that pre-order as the interminable 3year 'wait' ensued.  When I finally read that the book was complete, albeit only covering \\"half\\" the story I, like many, many other readers, was still excited.  Perhaps even beyond words. <br /> <br />Hence, it was with great excitement that I started reading AFfC.  To a degree, the book doesn't disappoint:  Cersei's egocentric bungling of a kingdom; Jaime's tortured boughts of honor and incestuous angst; Sansa and Samwell's brief but tasty morsels of delight.    <br /> <br />However, Arya (a favorite of mine) was barely present and Brienne's portion was, potentially (save for 1 sentence), without worth. <br /> <br />Finally, and most importantly, the entire gist of the book could be summarized in one short sentence (which most astute readers could've already gleened):  the gradu is hitting the fan in lower Westeros. <br /> <br />Now where is the second half of the story?  Where is A Dance with Dragons?  Perhaps this review, and those like it, can be fully accurate when the section is complete. <br /> <br />3.5 '*', rounded up on a curve.
B000BB14YY|5.0|I'd heard all the horror stories of the previous DVD transfers, and as soon as I saw \\"Criterion Collection\\" on the cover, I knew the wait was over for the definitive edition of the movie. <br /> <br />If you've been waiting for a masterful edition of the film, then your wait is over - as expected Criterion lives up to their reputation and supplies a great film in a great transfer. <br /> <br />I imagine most of the people reading these have already made up their minds on the movie itself, and I can say little that hasn't been said by others to sway you towards the movie - for those who haven't, I recommend watching this version of the film - it's the best edition out there bar none.
B000BNI90O|5.0|I agree with all of the positive remarks made by others.  The whole work is exquisite, but what I love most about this set is that there is much more of the elvish music.  The haunting song sung by the elves as they journey to the Grey Havens (Extended Version of the movie) seems to be much longer than it was even in the movie itself, and the music in Lothlorien seems to go on forever.  This set is definitely worth the price, but the wait for The Two Towers and The Return of the King sets might be a blessing in disguise, as paying for all three sets at one time might be a bit intimidating!  But even with the prices, I'll be buying the next two as soon as they come out, and (HINT) I would buy a CD of only elvish music, too.
B00062J00S|4.0|Or was it really ever thus? Small town America before World WarII: innocent, insular & secure. I\\"m not sure. I am sure it is the pinnacle of American movie making & story telling.  The scene, at the end when Clarence takes  George on a journey through his life is on par with The Christmas Carol. But I hope nobody tries to remake this. Jimmy Steward, Donna Reed, Henry Travers & a glimpse of the great Lionel Barrymore. You'll recognize the rest. You haven't seen It's a Wonderful Life? You must be ten. You will.
B000B8QEZG|5.0|this is my favourite album of '05'. buy it, you won't regret it.
B0000AQS6R|5.0|The best of the Vacation movies, Christmas Vacation ranks right up there with \\"The Three Amigos\\", \\"Caddyshack\\", and \\"Fletch\\" as one of Chevy Chase's best films. Chase can't take all the credit, however, as the fantastic cast (including Randy Quaid and a young Juliette Lewis) works perfectly to produce some incredibly hilarious scenes. <br /> <br />One of the true classics of Christmas, this comedy should be essential viewing at each Yuletide season. And, while the DVD extras are sparse, it's the movie itself that really matters. And, in this case, the movie works perfectly. <br /> <br />For having almost no flaws, and for providing years of holiday entertainment for the whole family, Christmas Vacation gets five stars!
B00008H2LB|3.0|this one is less inovative than hybrid theory is still a landmark one of the albums that stops nu metal being to samy <br />i think this is a good second album although they appear to be having conflict there having trouble mixing the rapping with chesters vocals and seems very forced not pre meditated but added after the song was finished so mike shinoda can still do his thang instead of being pushed to the bak there are a few exceptions faint is one and somewhere i belong is another somewhere belong you could say sounds way to much like an attempt to recreate there hit in the end this is worth your money there are some really good songs although as an album in places it is too inconsistant there are still some really worthwhile songs on this album  <br /> <br />my picks  <br />numb-melodic emotional passionate <br />faint-rap-verses brutal heavy choruses your standard nu metal song except with some sense of melody and feeling <br />dont stay- hip hop drumming reminisant of one step closer from there first album <br />breaking the habit-nice spanish guitar at the begining slightly mellower than alot of the others the chorus is an epic <br />lying from you-a nice song one of the ones where the rap seems to fit perfectly chester holds on long note while mike raps underneath  <br />easier to run- an anthemic chorus comes sudenly from a quieter mellower intro a good song
B000AYEL6U|5.0|I can't find the words to express how wonderful this production is. It's truly truly beautiful. Not since the Ehle/Firth version of Pride and Prejudice have I been so in love with a story.  If you adore Lizzy and Mr. Darcy you will adore Margaret and Mr. Thorton. Their relationship begins with much dislike and misunderstanding which of course leads to a deep and soulful love. The ups and downs we experience in watching these 2 characters is wonderful.  And the ending is...MAGICAL. Oh so romantic.  I can't recommend this movie enough.  For you period piece romance lovers--this movie will be at the top of your list.
B00004Z459|4.0|there is light at the end of the tunnel for nu metal me being 16 now and buying this record when i was quiet young it has done well to stay on my shelves this long its a decent attempt and to give you a better picture linkin park use alot of effects they arnt really a guitar band but alot of there songs are quite moving crawling  paper cut and in the end are an example of this chesters vocals are powerful and passionate the rap is good in places in some songs for example crawling the rap dosnt really work i dont usually like rap but it works well here so its an inovative album the most inovative or all there works and definatly the one i would pick out of all of them
B000BW7QWW|5.0|I am absolutely floored at how great this film was.  I just bought it today because I did not know that it came out on Tuesday otherwise I'd have written this review on Tuesday.  My dad and I just watched this and he said, \\"I have not enjoyed a film that much in a long time.\\"  Nor have I.  This film succeeds because of its characters, its story, and its heart, a thing lacking in many films today.  See this film, or you are robbing yourself of something that will touch you more than you think it will.
B000007T1M|5.0|as with all system of a down albums there is some thing that pulls you in never letting you go the manic genius. in all of the system albums is enought to turn you insane.i can not pick out a single weak album from all of there 5 efforts this is by far the heaviest and most metal of all there albums witch will atract others and force others to stay away. whatever your preference this album haw many highlights here is a run down of all the tracks .system my be desribed as being in thenu metal a genre witch is usually dull and bland but system are the opposite they are quirky energetic witty melodic. they can play with passion and feeliing as well as having the uncanny ability to switch moods quiker than some bands can finish an album.   maybe they are nu metal maybe theyve found something good out of it maybe not maybe they dont fully qualify as nu metal there too good here is a low down of the tracks on the album although you should let your own judgement be your guide    suite pee 9/10 vulgar offensive rude but brilliant wacky quirky and witty the intro shows such wit it ill have you on the edge    know 8/10 a truely hard hitting number brilliant drumming a good most pit anthem malakians guitar playing has gaps and he makes good use of the space provided and filled by the drummer     11/10 sugar this song is up there with chop suey aerials byob(in my opinion is a good song but has become the song that non fans use to calssify them as system fans)toxicity roulette and many more system classics brutal humourous feels like a stampeade of elephants on speed    sugestions 10/10 i love this track the acoustic beginnig shows there ability to create atomosphere as well as hitting us with grinding riffs and heavy motifs     spiders 11/10 my favourite on the album again up there with the classics beautiful haunting melodic epic cant find enouf words to describe it true beauty u wont hear head any of this passion in a band such as korn this is a truely passionate number    Ddevil 7/10 lyrically this song is very good a bit to over the top for me but still a good song but mainly the lyrics    soil 8/10 hard rocking number great solo good lyrics good guitar this song puts bands like slpitknot to shame has a good guiar solo in the middle     war? 9/10 system can combine different feels in a matter of seconds while some bands will feel the need to strecth a song system can shift so easily the quiet section in the middle helps the rest of the song that is repeated sound louder as he sings in the middle section you can hear him almost holding in his anger as hes about to unleash in the chorus again    peephole 9.5/10 takes a while to get started but this is one of the wackiest songs on the album sounds alot like the music would hear at a circuc system of a down have the ablilty to make you visualise things creepy disturbed visions or beautiful landscapes     cubert 8/10 this song has alot to it the verse are a tad annoying but the chorus is really in your face very catchy and the tune seems to carry alot of wit its almost poking fun at the other bands of the nu metal genre who cant wright songs in the same league its a good mosh pit number  ablunder    darts 9/10 for those of you who heard f**k the system this is simmilar in the way in witch he experiments with his voice serjs voice seems to have the cabailty do  anything   with his voice its also in someways similar to the singing on shes like heroin on there most recent album except this one sounds much better the transition of his voice to his spluttered out vocals and then a blinding heavy wieght chorus    P L U C K  9.5/10 this song starts agressive and with alot of screaming very reminisant of the rest of the nu metal genra but then something ususpected happens it shifts into darons desending riff and then a verse witch as in yourface as the last 2 tracks this will really piss off the rest of the heavy metal genre the verse is very catchy even though the chorus is vaguly similar to gindcore (horrible horrible horrible horrible genre belive me im not usually a person to dismiss a genre but it is )     inspiring piece of work witch should of been hard to follow up but system of a down have risen to the challenge another for times i recommend you check out there full body of work many people who do like there most recent work however may not like this even those who are fans of toxicity all there albums are different remeber this there darkest album       question nu metal or metal finaly answered  they may have some of the traits but if they are nu metal then they have taken to genre to somewhere unknown given it life added passion even if you dont like metal this is a classic album    if you like this maybe these albums would be essential to purchase toxicity and maybe steal this album mezmerize hypnotise    if you dont like this then try out mesmerize hypnotise possibly toxicity as well
B0002BO0AS|5.0|I don't know the all the terminology (hardcore/metalcore/deathmetal/blah blah blah) but this cd simply kicks ass. This band is very talented, and I can't wait for more music to come from them. <br />I don't know what these guys are talking about sounding like shadows fall, or Kill Switch. They are very different from those bands. I don't like either of those bands, and I love this cd.  <br />The vocals are awesome, the guitars are awesome, and the band itself is very talented. Its not this straight up one riff death metal nonsense you can't understand. If you like fast paced music, with awesome guitar riffs/breakdowns, and raging vocals you will love this stuff!!!! <br />
B000BMSTMS|2.0|nu metal has never been my thing even thou my favourite band system of a down is addmittedly nu metal nu metal have always been ok they where the pioneers of nu metal but ive never really liked there work they are good for the genre there in but in standard terms i dont like them they seem to shouty admittedly they are innovitive at times but there isnt that much passion just break neck riffs i give it two because by there standards this is a good album any other korn album ive had the disadvantage of hearing would get 1 so if you like korn this is the one for you
B000002542|4.0|I began listening to Journey in the early 70's.  This is how I remember them.  They had a progressive edge that usually came out of England.  This is when musicians could sing, write good songs, and play their instruments.  Many of them were classically trained.  The song tracks To Play Some Music, Of A Lifetime, and Kohoutek are excellent.  Don't expect any girlie pop songs here...this is before Steve Perry...That was when I stopped listening to them.  Now this is Journey!!!
B00000I78Y|5.0|im giving 5 stars to the whole album click on all reviews to see my full review of all the other track im gonna look at the two bonus tracks witch are one of the few that are written by serj on his own since most system of a down songs are written by daron malakin the guitarist    marmalade 10/10 this has such an infectious riff may sound like something out of a horror film you might think well it is system of a down recorded it onto the strange land soundtrack a film made in the year 2000 the verse has some realli wacky bass work from shavo    storaged 6.5/10 uses alot of space i dont realli think its as good as the other lack of anything merable in my opinion too stop start for me
B0006GAOBI|5.0|When I first watched this director's cut, I thought maybe the version I saw at the theatre was some kind of mistake.  I liked this much better--there was more depth, more nuance, more--well, just more.  It was better.  It's just better, that's all.  The story-telling, the pacing, the visuals, the music, they all contribute to a better viewing experience in this director's cut.   <br /> <br />The bonus disc has good features and the short about the #1 fan is hilarious in an \\"I'm gonna kill John Lennon\\" kind of way.  I kept waiting for the guy to pull a gun and go nuts on the crowd.  Alas, he didn't, and we're all better for it.
B00006LLNU|5.0|not that this album is boring but it is great music to listen to before you go to sleep such beauty such calm grace will have you dozing off if your tired when your awake its just as good you can appreciate the class of this album even more there are no real pick out songs the whole album is a bit like one long song on critism is that they all sound the same well there are differences and i think this is one of the really good things about this as an album you wouldnt really buy this as a single and this is more one long masterpiece than a seris of songs as the album progresses the songs seem to get loud and when where at the end it signs off in style sigur ros are inovative thoughtful admittedly the lyrics i dont realli understand but the sounds still have meaning to me even then i strongly recommend this to anyone wiether your thing is metal rock hip hop r n b classic just about anyone would love this release
B00005OWEG|5.0|Okay, so I admit to being a little nuts about this movie.  I love it.  The wife hates it.  That's just me being me and her being her.  The thing is, if you liked the original, you'll like this.  The added scenes with the French colonialists alone make this version worth owning.  Add in an extended sequence with topless Playboy bunnies, some additional footage of piggy, piggy, Brando, and Bobby Duvall looking for his surfboard and you've got yourself some real entertainment! <br /> <br />It's just a darn good flick, plain and simple, and like I already said, if you liked the original, you'll like this.  I love the smell of napalm in the morning.  It's that smell...that gasoline smell...it smells like...victory.

B0000640SA|4.0|Only every time I see you.  This movie is a serious trip!  Like Mulholland Drive in that you'll watch it several times and experience those \\"Aha!\\" moments.  \\"Now I get it!\\"  I give it 4 stars instead of 5 due to some plot holes, but this is one of those movies that you'll want in your DVD collection.  The bonus disc has  all the features you'd expect, plus the option of watching the movie in sequence (the original movie runs backwards--kind of--that's really not an apt description--it's just kind of trippy).  I loved Joey Pants in this thing.  He did a great job.

B000002UC5|5.0|This is quite a unique album, in that there are complete songs mixed in with snippets of songs that stand alongside some instrumental pieces.  It's important to know the background of the making of this album, released right as The Beatles officially announced their break-up, and also at the same time as LET IT BE. Paul was, by his own later admission, physically and mentally exhausted and depressed, not to mention confused and concerned about where his life and career (if any) would take him.  Linda McCartney plays a role here as well, as the two were still newlyweds for the most part, and the lead-off song \\"The Lovely Linda\\" is a short little endearing expression of affection for his new wife.  Other songs like the classic \\"Every Night\\" clearly characterizes Paul's love for Linda and shows how integral a role she played for Paul at this time in Beatles/McCartney history (but upon closer listen is even deeper, with lyrics like \\"every night I just wanna go out, get out of my head\\").  The album was recorded largely at home in his living room, featuring Paul playing every instrument, truly one of the first ever 'lo-fi' albums.      The album has a slightly dark and emotive feel to it, particularly in the fadeout to \\"Hot As Sun/Glasses\\", where Paul seems to be purposefully creating in the musical arrangement an atmosphere of confusion and uneasiness, which could be seen as a parallel to his life at the time of this album's release, right in the middle of the breakup of The Beatles.  Paul's heavy breathing and drumming in the chaotic closer \\"Kreen-Akrore\\" also seems to embody this feeling.  \\"Singalong Junk,\\" the instrumental accompaniment to \\"Junk,\\" is ripe with a sense of lost and abandonment.    Otherwise, the songs found on McCARTNEY deal both with his newfound happiness with Linda (\\"That Would Be Something\\", \\"Oo You\\"), Linda's comforting of Paul during the last dark Beatles days (\\"Man We Was Lonely\\") and even some leftover tracks originally started with The Beatles(the classic \\"Junk\\" as well as \\"Teddy Boy\\").  Then there is one of McCartney's all time best songs, and perhaps his best known solo song, \\"Maybe I'm Amazed.\\"  This track, which was polished in the studio and features soaring guitar, piano and vocals, almost sounds out of place on this hodgepodge of a record, but its worthiness continues to shine.      When McCARTNEY was released in 1970, the general public and critics were pretty dumbfounded in the album's sparse, rough and homegrown arrangement.  However, it's these same characteristics that have set it apart from any other McCartney album that has followed, and apart from any other Beatles solo release at that time.  It was still good enough to go to #1 and move several million copies.    Place this collection next to the McCartney work found on SGT. PEPPER, MAGICAL MYSTERY TOUR, THE WHITE ALBUM and ABBEY ROAD, and it pales in comparison in a lot of ways.  But place this album in the context of history and where Paul was at this time in his life, and its charm has only gotten better with age.  Avant-garde, rocking and achingly beautiful McCARTNEY remains to this day.      (Also take note of the classic cover to this album, photographed by Linda.)
B00005LC1H|5.0|Fawlty Towers was a very dysfunctional hotel! On the sign outside the hotel, shown at the beginning of each episode, is the name of the hotel. Its name was sometimes humourously retitled \\"Fatty Owls\\",\\"Farty Towels\\", and even \\"Flowery Twats\\"!!!! That last one would never have made it onto an American network other than PBS!

However, out of the six women that attended, only one had lukewarm praise for it; the rest of us thought it drivel. I wish there was a libary for forgotten books: it would be a worthy candidiate!
0446677450|5.0|Rich Dad Poor Dad is the story of a boy who had 2 major financial influences.  His real dad (Poor Dad) who stressed getting a college education and a secure job and his best friends dad (Rich Dad) who became a major business mogul in Hawaii.  The story helps to illustrate Kiyosaki's vision of how the Rich think compared to everyone else.  He makes tons of great points in the book and teaches you to think a bit differently about money, investing and risk.  One of the most interesting and moving points he makes in the book is about assets and liabilitites.  He says that the rich accumulate assets and the poor and middleclass accumulate liabilities that they think are assets.  Kiyosaki goes into detail about how his rich dad felt a house was a liability rather then an asset.  For myself I had never really thought of it that way and he made an interesting point.  His point was not to not own a house but rather that if thats your biggest \\"investment,\\" then you are not thinking like a rich person but rather like the poor or middle class. <br /> <br />Sometimes it takes Kiyosaki a while to make his point but once he does you feel like you learned something.  I would recomend this book to ANYONE, thats right ANYONE as it can only increase your financial knowledge.

B000002H4C|4.0|I saw this movie as a youth, and the soundtrack was the first record I ever bought that was rock 'n roll.  A good start, I must say.  The original record was a double-album.  Funny nowadays that you can fit that on one CD. <br /> <br />But even after all of these years, some of these tracks still stand out as some of my favorites:  Cheap Trick's Reach Out and I Must Be Dreamin', Black Sabbath's Mob Rules, Blue Oyster Cult's Veteran of the Psychic Wars, and the Devo and Riggs tracks are all great.  The mellow stuff, even as a kid, I could do without.  Interestingly, the follow up movie has a soundtrack that is truly all metal, yet that soundtrack and film are far inferior to this original.   <br /> <br />The film has aged, but if you were a fan of the magazine back then and can remember what animation was like back then; you can still probably bring yourself back to that time and remember what made it so good.
6305313687|5.0|Awesome, powerful movie about hate and how it can rip apart a society. Norton gives an jaw dropping performance about a Neo Nazi that changes his hating ways after a prison education. But, tragically it is too late for his brother. Great movie about redemption and how hate and lack of understanding will continue to divide our country.

B00025ETIW|5.0|Part I: <br /> <br />For those of you who are not SLAVES to genre labels and don't suffer a heart attack at the thought of someone you don't know, nor care about labeling your musical tastes as \\"mainstream,\\" you might want to try this album. It is strong musically as well as lyrically. When I first heard My Chemical Romance I didn't expect to like them, however, this album really impressed me. This band is extremely different from the norm. Lyrically and musically they bring something new to the table, mainly, originality. Their lyrics are intriguing, metaphoric, and at times ironic. The songs are fast, loud, and brilliant. My Chemical Romance has managed to blend genres to create a sound totally and completely their own. My personal favorites are Hang 'Em High, Helena, and I Never Told You What I Do for A Living. However, there isn't a single track on this album that isn't good. From top to bottom, this is a great album. If you want to track the evolution of this band I also suggest you get their first album. It's undeniably different from Three Cheers for Sweet Revenge. Bullets is more raw yet no less entertaining.  <br /> <br />Part 2: <br /> <br />As I was reading through the other reviews one stood out to me. Stan, I have a question. Why are you arguing with teenagers and/or their parents? The people who come to this page and actually read these reviews (which are few and far between to begin with) don't give a damn about your personal musical tastes. Why waste your time annoying people who are actually looking for a legitimate review of the album they are going to purchase, by providing them with a condescending dissertation on your personal musical preferences? If they wanted to know about ALL the albums YOU like then they would take a look at one of your Amazon music guides, if one exists. If not, I suggest you make one. It would be much more helpful. <br /> <br />I would also suggest that if you want to be condensing and \\"teach\\" people about music that perhaps you shouldn't place Jimi Hendrix AT THE BOTTOM of a list topped by Tool. I mean, are you serious? Who is really going to take you seriously when you write up small reviews for Tool and Metallica but put Hendrix and Zeppelin at the bottom of the list. I realize you would like to crawl into a hole where 90s rock reigns supreme and name dropping Hendrix, Pink Floyd and Led Zeppelin give you \\"credibility,\\" but come on man. There would be no Metallica without Hendrix and Zeppelin and I'm not even going to comment on Tool.  <br /> <br />Stan, step away from the computer, find some people your own age to start a pointless musical debate with, and get a life please. <br />
B000BW7QWW|5.0|DON'T SEE THIS MOVIE! That is, not until after you've seen the Firefly series. Don't get me wrong, the movie stands on its own, but has a much more emotional impact if you're familiar with the series. Firefly is arguable one of the greatest series ever, and now Serenity takes its place as one of the finest films ever made in my opinion (and Joss didn't need 150 million to do it). Once you become familiar with these characters and the 'verse they live in, they will become like family.
0689865384|5.0|Hey, this book, Uglies, is one of my favorite books now, it intertwines connections of love, sacrifice, action, and adventure into a 400 page book! The story line is captivating; it brings societal ideas to the reader, and allows the reader to ponder them. Overall, this was a fun and exiting book! I am also amazingly exited to read Pretties, and then Specials! I highly recommend this book to a person of any age.
B000002KGT|5.0|Rumours to this day continues to be in the top 5 of albums sold. <br />When Lindsay Buckingham and Stevie Nicks joined the group, the history of Rock changed forever. <br />Buckingham and Nicks were in LA starving. Buckingham came to the attention of Mick Fleetwood who asked Buckingham to join as their guitarist. <br />Buckingham would only join if Stevie Nicks was allowed to join as well. <br />Fleetwood consented and the rest is history. <br />Rumours is chocked full of hits. <br />Dreams by Stevie Nicks was a major hit for the band and had considerable radio time. <br />Never Going Back again is a personal favorite of mine with Lindsay Buckingham and his acoustic guitar. It is a very catchy tune. <br />Go your own Way is a song to Nicks from Buckingham as they were in the process of breaking up. <br />Christine McVea and her haunting version of Songbird was a concert finale for the band. <br />The Chain is another great song with exqquisite harmonies. <br />Another very good song from Christine McVea is You make loving Fun which also did very well commercailly. <br />Gold Dust Woman ends the album on a very strong note. <br />I never tire of this album. <br />If you were to buy the top 10 classic albums of all time, you would have to include Rumours.

B000BZIT5M|5.0|Of all the versions I have seen, this is the one I enjoy the most. The singing is excellent, Neil Schicoff (Rodolfo) in particular is brilliant both as a singer and as an actor, and the turbulent relationship of Marcello and Musetta is hilarious without turning into a parody as in so many other productions.  <br /> <br />And for once all of the key caracters act really well. When all the friends are together in Rodolfo's apartment in act 1, there's a real chemistry between them, certainly better than in most films about friends, and they seemingly have no trouble fooling around with each other in a very natural way while still singing well. The production is traditional, but warm and with an old-time Disney flavour to it (in a good way), and the camera angles and cuts are tastefull and well considered.
B00005JO1Y|1.0|If you know cinema how can you like this piece of garbage. First of all, it was way way overlong with many unneccesary scenes like the one with the characters battling giants insects in a cave, what's that all about? it's boring and it deviates from the main plot of the movie. When I went to see this movie I've just seen the original 1933 version and I was worried that Jackson will humanised the ape which is supposed to be wild like in the 33 version. Boy was I right! He made Kong almost human just to get cheap emotions from the audience, the scenes with Naomi Watts entertaining him and trying to make contact with him were laughable and so stupid that Jackson should be ashame of himself. This is only special effects and nothing else, it has nothing to do with cinema at all. Jack Black is a big mistake of casting, I like him usually but in this mess he was a jerk and not likable at all. Adrian Brody did ok with the bad script he had because he's a great actor as for Naomi Watts she made a fool of herself and all she do is cry for nothing during all the movie. This version of King Kong is very very bad and all of the edge and creativity of the 33 version is lost here without a doubt. Mr. Jackson you were way better when you did independant movies.
B00005JO04|5.0|The best movies are subtle affairs, with room and space to notice wonderful minutiae, such as marveling over the way John Ford frames John Wayne in the doorway as it closes at the end of THE SEARCHERS or Marcello Mastroianni straining unsuccessfully to hear what the young girl representing innocence is yelling at him on the beach at the end of LA DOLCE VITA.  But I don't know if SYRIANA contains such subtleties or not.  The plot narrative was so convoluted; so complex, and so inexpertly laid out that it took all my concentration to keep up with what was happening.  The movies have seen a host of profoundly complex films over the years.  Even Raymond Chandler was said not to quite understand what was happening in Howard Hawks's version of THE BIG SLEEP.  My guess with this film is that the script started off as a huge, incoherent mess, and in subsequent rewrites they only barely managed to make it intelligible.  If there is subtlety in the film, I was working too hard to notice it.<br /><br />The movie's ultimate incoherence is a shame, because it contains many otherwise excellent things.  For instance, it is one of the rare films that has attempted to address some of the issues associated with globalization and one of the few that tries to show how astonishingly interrelated the world has become.  Decisions undertaken in Houston or Washington or London or Beijing can work to fuel much of the anger and alienation that has fueled what we in the West call terrorism but which in other parts of the world are viewed as acts of self-defense.  The film is to be commended for resisting the stupidity inherent in the assumptions that the Arab world \\"hates us because of our love of freedom\\" or other mindless platitudes.  The film tries to explain that what seems to us to be irrational acts are to those committing terrorist acts completely rational.  Furthermore, the film also tries to explain why a very large number of nations around the world regard the United States consider the United States engaged in terrorism, seen in the smart bomb killing of a reformist sheik.<br /><br />For most Americans the story of the United States intervening to keep a unqualified and unpopular but pro-Western ruler in charge of a Middle Eastern country instead of a far more popular, competent, but anti-Western ruler will be completely unfamiliar.  But this plot element has deep overtones in the Gulf Region.  The first deep intrusion by the CIA into foreign affairs was the coup they orchestrated in 1953 to remove Mohammed Mossadegh from power in Iran and insert the Shah in his place.  The parallels to the story told in the film are palpable.  Mossadegh was far more democratically minded, far more progressive, and far more in favor of making life better for most Iranians, but he was also intent on keeping Iran's oil wealth from flowing almost exclusively to Western corporate entities.  In this film, our reformer wants to align himself more closely to the Chinese, an arrangement that benefits his fictional country far more than one with the United States.  I have not read Baer's original book nor have I heard details, but I would be willing to bet that the Mossadegh incident was a prime inspiration for the story.<br /><br />As I said, I commend the intellectual seriousness of the film and its attempt to lay out the current global situation and to try to explain some of the issues at the heart of Middle Eastern politics, but at no point in this film can I say that I enjoyed it.  It is more a film that you respect than like.  It was lacking the human element found in all good films.  It was more like watching a Middle Eastern textbook in film version.<br /><br />The cast was exceptionally solid, but because of the limitations of the script, no one really stood out.  George Clooney was enjoyable, playing a completely burned out CIA spy.  I think most of the attention, however, that his role is receiving is related more to his playing against type and having gained so much weight for the role.  There are a large number of competent performances, but given the complexity of the narrative and the huge number of performers, no one really stands out.  It was interesting to see Alexander Siddig in his role of the reform-minded prince.  The only other thing I have seen him in was STAR TREK:  DEEP SPACE NINE, so it was fascinating to see him in a completely different role.<br /><br />I left the theater mildly impressed but definitely not entertained.  It is not impossible to have a very good yet political film; Costa-Gavras's Z proved that.  SYRIANA does not.ng gained so much weight for the role.

B00006JL1Z|5.0|Fleetwood Mac in the 70's and early 80's were the biggest band on the planet. <br />With a new line-up that included Stevie Nicks and Lindsay Buckingham they owned the music world. <br />Rumors is still on the top 5 best sellers of all-time. <br />This compilation includes all their hits and some rare gems as well. <br />Silver Springs was recorded during the Rumors sessions. Stevie Nicks asked if she could use the song for a solo album. <br />Mick Fleetwood did not allow her to use the song. <br />It was later recorded for the Dance and became a major hit for them in the 90's <br />The version you hear on this compilation is the one recorded for Rumors in the 70's <br />Its almost frightening that a song this good was not included on Rumors. <br />Fleetwood Mac continues to tour and record and still makes great music. <br />This is for the serious Fleetwood Mac fan who wants to hear rare gems, and cant not get enough of their classic songs.

B00005JKNC|1.0|After turning two of the most hard-hitting dramas within roughly the past ten years (Shawshank Redemption and Green Mile), I had high expectations for the Majestic. What we get, dismayingly, is a warmed-over tribute to 1950's Marxists, and for all of you Joe McCarthy haters out there, I would remind you that since we know that many of McCarthy's accusations were correct (as verified by project Venona, a collection of KGB files released at the fall of the Soviet Union), as well as the fact that McCarthy insisted on his hearings being secret (hearings that raging Democrats insisted go public), the premise of the film is rather comical. Of course, McCarthy had little if anything to do with HUAC, being, of all things, a member of the senate instead of the house. Mark my words, however, reviewers of this film will babbble about how it crystalizes a time when America was in the death-grip of Joe McCarthy. Hardy har, har. Read Ann Coulter's \\"Treason,\\" and get back to me once you have salvaged your knowledge of history from the Marxist revisionists.   <br /> <br />Aside from the liberal-drooling, its just a bad film. Anti-climatic, glossed over, and as sentimental as a Disney movie with a talking dog. I hated every moment of it, and have lost respect for Darabont as a director. See at your own risk, but don't say I didn't warn you.
B0000AI44Q|5.0|I'm a huge NY fan, but man it's been a long time since I was excited about one of his new releases.  In fact, I avoided buying or even listening to Greendale because I was afraid of being disappointed. So I was a little skeptical when I saw the movie offered for free on digital cable.  But I tried it anyway, and as soon as the first song was underway, I knew that it was a winner.  I couldn't stop smiling, or listening.  My boyfriend exclaimed \\"what a stupid movie!\\" but he can't relate anyway.  I at first wished the movie had real, trained actors in it and better film quality, but after repeated watchings it really has grown on me.  It's old school Neil through and through, and if anything you gotta love it for that.  Enough of the movie, the album alone is one of his best, hands down, bar none.  It's about a lot of things:  the allure of the darkness, the callousness of modern life, the perspective shifts between the generations, the challenges facing the environment, the corruption in our corporations and political machines, long lasting relationships and there's still some left to name I'm sure.  I think history will prove that this is one of his most defining albums to date, like Nebraska was for Bruce.  Best of all, finally, this one ROCKS!!
0393035158|5.0|Mr. Harris writes well and the book is outstanding and thoughtful. Organized religion is and always will be a dangerous opiate for the masses no matter what myth drives the conduct. Homo sapiens (humans)will always only be homo sapiens. Humans never have been nor ever will be fortune tellers, Gods, or diciples of whatever religious myth one chooses to identify with.

B0006GAOBI|5.0|OK, OK. So I think Jake Gyllenhaal is the greatest thing since sliced bread, and if I were a teenager, I would have posters of him plastered all over my wall. I also adore Mary McDonnell as well and would probably watch a film with her in it even if it were a depiction of a Paramecium's journey into adulthood.    My biases aside, I think this film is absolutely terrific. It's haunting and beautifully made. Even the soundtrack enhances the film and the songs stick with you, reminding of the scenes they supported.    I have watched this film several times, and each time I notice something different.    It leaves you feeling sad and happy; concerned and satisfied; and alive.    I highly recommend this film. It's out of the ordinary but down to earth.
0553801503|4.0|Well, I finally finished reading the book today. I had a hard time following it at first but that was because I don't like new story lines added to an already moving plot. On the other hand in the overall picture I believe it's only going to make the story better. I did miss hearing from all of the characters in this book but beggars can't be choosers half a book is better then no book. In typical George Martin fashion anything and anyone is fair game. Overall this is a very good book and I can't wait till the next one.
0517123207|5.0|As the great scientist Newton said \\"I saw further for I stand on the shoulders of giants\\".  Wallace may have seen something further than Darwin when he later in his life said that we have souls or spirits that accounts for our humanity.  I believe that the paradigm shift which brings into account ghosts and spirits when it comes to why we cannot fully explain humans is overdue.  I know the reader is skeptical about these kinds of things but I myself saw entities that could not be mistaken for something else other than ghosts and spirits, which is also seen and observed by many other human beings all over the world.  I do not believe that they are non-material beings who co-inhabit this planet with us and are just mistaken for ghosts for when you see them they have the form of humans, and it is well known that the physical form of humans evolve so that it could be used in the physical world to handle material objects such as legs for running, arms and hand to hold and lift objects, etc. that is why it doesn't make sense that these non-material beings mimic the physical form of humans, so it is most likely that these beings are ghosts and spirits who once inhabit the physical body of human beings and that they mimic the physical form for they once inhabit a physical body...I also cannot believe that they are holograms.  On the other hand, to me it is funny that people who believe in a God has a double standard.  They believe in a God that they do not see but find it humorous to believe in Ghosts that they also do not see.  Isn't the two just different manifestations of the after life? To me it is even easier to see a ghost than to see God, I believe they visit the physical world more than God does..You can hear people say  \\"I saw a ghost last night\\" or \\"I saw a ghost in that old house\\" but I never really heard anyone say \\"I saw God.\\"  As for Scientists, wether they believe in a God or not, I cannot blame them for being skeptical about these kinds of matters for they cannot emperically observe ghosts and spirits.  But not everything has to be observed.  It is true that \\"observation is the key to knowledge\\" but Einstein stated that \\"imagination is much more important than knowledge\\" so that is the reason why I believed Wallace saw further than Darwin when he later on believed and suggested that we have souls that make us human for he probably realized that humans are too complex to just be explained by evolution even though our animal bodies are also a product of evolution like any other animals in this PLANET, that is the reason why when studying Chimpanzee behavior, which are 95% the same as our DNA, their are eery similarities to how they behave in society.  All those power struggles, murders, sexual jealousy, male machismo and competition, its all rooted in our DNA.  But unlike Chimpanzees, we humans have souls, it is the responsibility of our souls to be FREE ENOUGH of our \\"bloodline\\", free enough of our bodies to make decisions, to make choices and not be easily overcome by our bodily tendencies.  Also a reader might think that in this VAST UNIVERSE, ghosts and spirits DOES NOT FIT IN THE PICTURE...but what if this VAST UNIVERSE is a VAST RUSE...DESIGNED to trap an OVERLY INTELLECTUAL MIND...  Even scientists nowadays are admitting that when it comes to the study of humans we are barely scratching the surface.  Darwin and Wallace was both right about their  observations about evolution, but Wallace saw further for he probably knew that we cannot emperically observe everything...  Science can only explain what it can observe.    P.S.  I challenge ALL scientists who comes across this review to begin an ALL OUT investigation of the phenomenon of seeing ghosts..so we could tell once and for all if so many people all over the world are just dillusional, that is why they have sightings of ghosts...OR they truly did saw something and is just being discredited by science because they cannot, FOR NOW, explain it!
B000AADYRQ|5.0|If you enjoy meaning and poetry in songs (not in a sappy type of way) then you would love Plans. It's mellow dramatic and great chords to follow it. This is probably one of their best albums, along with transatlantic. One of my favorites!
B000BC8TBE|5.0|Received this today, from Amazon.com from my friend Chellie, for Christmas, from my wishlist.

B000B8QEZG|2.0|I don't care how big of a Madonna fan any of us can be, this CD is just annoying. Did she phone in the vocals?  <br /> <br />My partner is however stuck on this CD like Linus to his blanket. He LOVES it. Don't get me wrong, I'm not a Madonna basher. I just don't like this CD. For all it claims to be, \\"Confessions\\" is neither catchy or groundbreaking. The lyrics to most of the songs are brainless and repetitive. C'mon, \\"Ring, ring, ring goes the telephone....\\" The arrangements are a techno nightmare relying mostly on samples of other songs. Like we need to feed ABBA anymore royalties.  <br /> <br />Better to buy Madonna's early stuff. Now there's an idea... How about making an album sampling her old music and then \\"techno\\" it all up. She wouldn't even have to show up to the recording studio.

B000BB14YY|5.0|Kurosawa's last undisputed masterpiece, \\"Ran\\" adapts \\"King Lear\\" (Shakespeare was one of Kurosawa's favorite writer) placing it during the 16th century in Japan. Like \\"Throne of Blood\\" (another Kurosawa classic that also adapts \\"Macbeth\\") \\"Ran\\" melds action with drama in a unique way that only Kurosawa was able to do. Sure there have been other directors that have made films about Japanese culture, Feudalism and the Samurai but none with the keen insight and profound glimpse into what makes a culture tick as well as Kurosawa.<br /><br />Kurosawa had lost most of his collaborators prior to the shooting of \\"Ran\\". All of that informs the darkness and his identification for the main character. While Kurosawa freely borrowed from \\"King Lear\\", he also informed the film with many issues facing himself; he felt isolated from the Japanese filmmaking community and he was unappreciated in this late phase of his career having to scramble to get financing (frequently going overseas to get it). Kurosawa felt isolated and alone without his collaborators. The loss of his wife just prior to shooting meant that Kurosawa threw his raging emotions into \\"Ran\\" using the story of \\"Lear\\" as a means to examine his own personal situation.<br /><br />A beautiful, rich transfer from Criterion. There's few digital artifacts and there's virtually none of the issues that dogged the \\"Masterworks\\" edition of this film. The image isn't cropped (the \\"Masterworks\\" edition had the edge of the frame cut off) and the high definition transfer looks marvelous with rich colors, remarkable clarity and depth to the image. There is noticeable grain but that's part of the original theatrical presentation of the film and not a surprise given that the film is 20 years old. The Dolby Digital 2.0 soundtrack has no noticeable distortion with nice depth and clarity for both the dialogue and the music.<br /><br />Chris Marker's marvelous documentary \\"AK\\" is included as part of the package on the second disc. That by itself would also make this worth repurchasing if you're in doubt about it. However, coupled with the terrific restoration and transfer done by Criterion here it makes this an essential purchase for fans of Kurosawa's films. We also get an appreciation by director Sidney Lumet, an episode of Toho Masterworks on Kurosawa that's also quite good (although I prefer Marker's 74 minute documentary). \\"It is Wonderful to Create\\" focuses exclusively on \\"Ran\\" while Marker's documentary is a better overview of the director. Criterion has also used Kurosawa's original sketches and paintings to create sections of \\"Ran\\" as Kurosawa original saw it prior to actual production. Finally there's a new interview with lead actor Tasuya Kakadai. As usual Criterion has included an excellent booklet that includes a very good essay by film critic Michael Wilmington, a 1985 interview with Kurosawa about the making of the movie and a new interview with \\"Ran\\" composer Toru Takemitsu. This deluxe 2 disc edition makes the nonanamorphic previous edition look almost like a videotape by comparison in terms of the overall quality.<br /><br />Stephen Prince provides interesting background about Japanese culture and Kurosawa's film style. Prince's commentary is a bit dry coming across as a lecture that one might sit through at UCLA or USC and isn't all that entertaining but it is quite informative. Personally, I would have preferred an interactive commentary with Prince discussing the film with, say, Lumet, Francis Ford Coppola or another well known film director.<br /><br />This is an essential purchase for fans of Kurosawa. Kurosawa's last epic is, perhaps, his darkest and one of his most accomplished. The extras would make this worth purchasing by themselves but the beautiful, rich high definition transfer makes this the best version of \\"Ran\\" that has ever appeared on home video.

0446577383|5.0|What starts as a nice little murder conspiracy quickly turns into a fast paced adventure with many plot twists.  The story has betrayal, loyalty, too much loyalty, and obsession.  The characters are developed enough to keep turning the page when things get a little slow.<br /><br />the dialogue was good and realistic, and I enjoyed the visuals described in the book as well.  I think this book could make a decent movie.  That is also something to think about when reading the book!<br /><br />This was my firsst Baldacci book and I suggest it be yours if you are new to the author.
B00005QDW5|3.0|I've always been divided over Pink Floyd--unlike many rock fans, I do not believe them to be the \\"Ultimate Definitive Rock Band\\". On the one hand, my image of Floyd is them as a pretentious bunch (Especially Dave Gilmour) and average musicians, with the exception of bassist Roger Waters. But on the other hand, this pretentious bunch came out with some of the best lyrics around.<br /><br />After being majorly disappointed by The Dark Side of the Moon, I found myself struggling to find much good about Floyd. A friend told me \\"pick up Echoes, it's good.\\" So I did. The result is a decent, but long collection. My main problem is that half of this album could've been pulled to make a more powerful Echoes. Which tracks specifically are up for debate, but I think most of us can agree on one thing; Nothing from The Wall on belongs.<br /><br />So here's my ideal tracklist, in chronological order, followed by song ratings out of 10<br /><br />1. Set the Controls for the Heart of the Sun: 10/10<br /><br />2. Echoes: 10/10<br /><br />3. Money: 10/10<br /><br />4. Time: 10/10<br /><br />5. Us & Them: 10/10<br /><br />6. Shine On You Crazy Diamond: 10/10<br /><br />7. Wish You Were Here: 10/10<br /><br />8. Sheep: 10/10<br /><br />9. Comfortably Numb: 10/10<br /><br />10. Another Brick in the Wall: 10/10<br /><br />As you can see, the best material on this collection is truly amazing stuff. So pick this up I guess. Just be warned, the good moments are few and far between. It doesn't help that If, a personal favorite of mine, doesn't show up.
B000001GQT|4.0|Herbert von Karajan recorded the great Strauss tone-poem Also Sprach Zarathustra three times, each time it was exceptional and each record ranks at the top of the mountain, so to speak. The first record was in 1959 with the Vienna Philharmornic. That was the version used by Stanley Kubrick in 2001: A Space Odyssey. This version that I'm reviewing here is from 1974 with the Berlin Philharmonic and there is a final version from 1983, also with Berlin. This 1974 account is probably the best ever from Karajan and possibly anybody. Perhaps the later 1983 has deeper, richer digital sound but this 1974 account is more passionate and breaths fire. The only reason I give it four and not five stars is the recording itself. The remastering has really brightened up the aural image and it sounds quite fierce at times. The later version, coupled with the tone-poem Don Juan is on the Karajan Gold disc, catalog number 439 016-2. Make sure you get that Gold disc to compare and contrast. If you're a fan of this work, you might want to get them both as there are a few, albeit, slight differences in the 2 recordings.    On this 1974 record I'm reviewing, track 2, Of the Backworldsmen is tremendously powerful, such sweeping string sound unlike in any Zarathustra you've ever heard and let's not forget to mention the riveting timpani at the famous opening. Unbelievable! However the later version packs quite a punch too in places on account of the digital sound, but it's not as driven or intense as this earlier Karajan version.    As for the music itself, Zarathustra is one of the most evocative and fascinating of the orchestral works of Strauss, from the famous opening to the transcendent fury to come to the hushed, meditative polytonal ending, contrasting the two keys representing man and nature. I want to pay particular attention to a couple of passages that display Strauss' strengths and weaknesses in this work. Listen to track 6, subtitled Of Science and Learning. Strauss composes a fugue based on all 12 tones of the chromatic scale, years before Schoenberg's shenanigans. The fugue is great, a dark sound rumbling from the bowels of the orchestra and then it grows and grows and wham, you get this ultra sweet sound on high violins! What's up with that?  Strauss schmaltzing it up!  Well, you can't have everything. Later in the work, Strauss uses the Viennesse waltz to convey the dance of Nietzsche's Superman. This is Strauss being at his ironic and humorous best and worst! Later the orchestra expands and explodes with unrelenting force in the part just before the Midnight Bell and then the music closes beautifully in the Song of the Grave. All in all, the tone-poem is a stunning display of orchestral wizardry and power and no composer in history could utilize the modern orchestra to the farthest range of it's capabilities like Richard Strauss. ( Gustav Mahler, Nicolai Rimsky-Korsakov, Maurice Ravel and Ottorino Respighi are four of his contemporary challengers. Before them, Hector Berlioz was one of the true orchestral innovators and Richard Wagner revolutionized orchestral sound and what the orchestra could do. He stands apart from the others. Without Richard Wagner, there would be no Strauss or Mahler. )    The other works on this CD are quite a success as well, Karajan loved the tone-poem Don Juan and played it many times, Till Eulenspiegel is played well too, I might prefer Haitink's version here.  The dance of the seven veils from Salome is highly sensual, but I prefer the power and sexual excitement of Solti's recording for this Salome excerpt.    I've heard many Zarathustras, two versions by Solti, the 1954 and 1960 Reiner versions as well as Kempe, Sawallisch, Boulez, Previn, Haitink and others, but it's Karajan I return to. This 1974 is top of the line but make sure to add the digital 1983 recording to your collection as well for comparison's sake, turn it up loud and be swept into ecstasy while sending all your neighbors into a fury!
B00008NRLX|5.0|This was my second purchase of a Jayhawks record, after 'Smile' which I thought had one of the catchiest tracks ever in its title song. <br /> <br />'Rainy Day Music' is one of my most played records - from the jangly guitars to the gorgeous harmonies, great lyrics to the amazing choruses and Gary Louris' soaring voice, this is a masterful album. I checked out the earlier ones and am now a Jayhawks completist. Every album has a rich consistency that very few other bands have been able to maintain. <br /> <br />What a great shame that the group has now disbanded - let us hope for some equally potent solo albums from Louris to compensate - some have made the transition before and he definitely has the talent.  <br /> <br />If you are more inclined to pop than heavy folk or alternative country, this is the album to buy, but once hooked on those harmonies, you'll be itching to get the lot!
B000BNI90O|5.0|It has been a tradition in the film score business, that if a score sells very well and the movie is popular enough, that the entire soundtrack will be released (all of the Star Wars movies, Cutthroat Island which actually was released only because the score was fantastic and people demanded the full deal, Star Trek, Superman). However, with the Lord of the Rings films, releasing the full score goes beyond the minor convenience of being able to hear any part of the movie you want, rather, we can hear the sheer brilliance of Shore's Wagnerian use of leitmotif and thematic development. We can follow the fellowship theme as it first appears when Sam and Frodo leave the Shire, through the village of Bree, and finally in its full glory when they form the fellowship. We finally get to hear the dwarf music which features a pacific Mauri choir with chanting by New Zealand football players! (no joke)You can hear the Gondor theme for the first time on solo french horn when Boromir is speaking in Rivendell. It's just such an amazing score that really transcends the genre of soundtracks and reaches more toward German Romantic opera in terms of form and thematic organization. It comes in a wonderful deluxe packaging similar to those of the limited edition soundtracks. A 40 page booklet is included with tons of information about the score and the individual tracks themselves. However, the real highlight of the score is the fourth disc which is the entire score in DVD audio and for those who have yet to experience the wonder that is DVD audio, this is a good starting point. Turn the volume up and put on the Khazad-Dm track and you will be sold on the splendid sonics. The price is high but for die hard fans of the series and score, for whom this has been produced, it is a worhtwhile investment and will take you back to the wonder of first seeing the film in the theater. Highest recommendation.
B000002UCQ|4.0|All Things Must Pass reminds me of the Beatles' White Album. Both are long, both have good songs, but both get bogged down by filler songs. Out of the 23 songs, I could've done without eight of them. However, there is no shortage of good material on this album. For instance, take all-time Harrison classic My Sweet Lord, which landed him a lawsuit. It does have that girl-group feel, but I'm sure that nobody was chanting \\"Hallelujah\\" or \\"Hare Krishna\\" in the background. This is a great, catchy tune/personal favorite. I also enjoy the psychadelic Wah-Wah, Dylan's If Not For You, What Is Life, Beware of Darkness, Sir Frankie Crisp, All Things Must Pass (especially) Art of Dying, I Dig Love, Awaiting On You All, Out of the Blue and Thanks For the Pepperonni. However, it does have a truckload of filler, be it either version of Isn't it a Pity (I don't care whether or not it was a hit!), Behind That Locked Door, Let It Down, Run of the Mill (an apt title), Plug Me In or It's Johnny's Birthday. I guess I like it enough to reccomend it, but the pre-breakup Beatles is a ton better.
B0000025L8|5.0|While not as \\"Rocking\\" or accessable as London Calling (new Clash fans should definatly check out that album first), Sandanista! is a 2 hour and 30 minute long sprawling masterpeice. <br /> <br />Some argue that this album is 2/5th great material and the rest is filler. Those people don't know good music if it bites them. <br /> <br />On this album the Clash explore all forms of music, including hip-hop, disco/dance, jazz, calipso, gospel, waltz, and of course, the usual dose of punk, rock, ska and raggae. This album is a journey. Longer, more varied and, at times, more fun than the Beatles \\"White Album\\" (and this album ranks up there with some of the Beatle's best). Will you like the album at first? Hmm, probably not. It takes repeated listens to appreciate the way The Clash cram hundreds of hooks and melodies into a single track. <br /> <br />  The Magnifigant 7 - A hip-hop dance number with GREAT lyrics. One of the best bass lines I've ever heard by Paul Simonon, and try not laughing when Strummer screams, \\"CHEESEBOIGER!\\" <br /> <br />  Hitsville U.K. - Starts like a gospel song, but quickly transforms into a singalong with some catchy-as-hell melodies. Note: the woman singing this song is Clash guitarist Mick Jone's exgirlfriend, Ellen Foley, who also song the epic Meatloaf song \\"Paradie By The Dashboard Light\\" <br /> <br />  Junco Partner - Great reggea flavored track, with some of the oddest sound effects dancing all over the place. Makes for a very odd and entertaining song.  <br /> <br />   Ivan Meets G.I. Joe - This song is literally a disco song being played over a futuristic war land. Laser sounds fill the air as drummer Topper Headen sings of a galactic showdown between \\"ivan\\" and \\"g.i.joe\\" (metaphores, you can figure it out) <br /> <br />   The Leader - The first (almost traditional)Clash rocker. Fast & quick. <br /> <br />   Something About England - A very lyrical one, with an interesting story behind it. <br /> <br />   Rebel Waltz - A waltz in.. yep, 3/4ths time. Begins with a chamber music-esuque instrumental, and turns into a touching song. <br />   <br />   Look Here - A dip into Jazz for the Clash. Paul Simonon nails the \\"walking bassline\\", and the piano is wonderfully jazzy.  <br /> <br />   The Crooked Beat - Paul Simonon's song. Very strange, as Paul does his traditional \\"talk-singing\\". It's a dub flavored reggae, probably the weakest track on the album, but still enjoyable. <br /> <br />   Somebody Got Murdered - a REAL rocker. More rock than punk i'd say. A fast catchy tune, with very affecting lyrics. Jones practically whispers over the loud guitars, \\"somebody got murdered.. somebody's dead forever.\\" <br /> <br />   One More Time - a darker reggae song.  <br />   One More Time Dub - a dub version of the latter. (Dub basically just entails an instrumental with reverb slapped all over the place, and echoing snare and hi-hat). <br /> <br />   Lightening Strikes - Another hip-hop dance track in the vein of \\"Magnifigant 7\\". Lots of references to New York city.  <br /> <br />   Up In Heaven - An overlooked gem. Great rocker. <br /> <br />   Corner Soul - another excellent track. While not really reggae at all, it sounds very... let's say.. babylon-esque. <br /> <br />   Let's Go Crazy - a great tropical song with steel drums. \\"So ya wanna go crazy!?\\" <br /> <br />   If Music Could Talk - A jazzy reggae number, with a wonderful sax solo. There are 2 vocal tracks, one in each channel (left and right).  <br /> <br />   The Sound of the Sinners - a gospel song! and a GREAT gospel song, in which the religious meaning comes off NOT being lame or cheesy.  <br /> <br />DISC TWO <br /> <br />   Police on my Back - a cover, but done SOO well. A true punk rocker, The most rocking thing on the album. The lead guitar sounds like sirens, and Jones gives a remarkable vocal performance, literally spitting the phrase \\"what have i done!?\\" <br /> <br />   Midnight Log - cool song. short and catchy, with great lyrics. <br /><br />   The Equaliser - very reverby, and sound effect coated. but a great sonf. <br /> <br />   The Call Up - a cool steady beat throughout. one of the highlight songs. \\"it's up to you not to hear the call up, i don't wanna die... i don't wanna kill.\\" <br /> <br />   Washington Bullets - possibly the peak of the album. great lyrics, very political. Spanish and tropical flavored. The best moment comes at 2:40 in, when, in his sweetest voice, Strummer proclaims \\"saaaandanista!\\" and a wave of cheering and clapping insues.  <br /> <br />   Broadway - This is quite a song. In my opinion it sounds a song U2 could easily cover. Strummer gives a wonderful lyrical performance. With one hoarse \\"yeeeah\\" he can make your hair stand on end. <br /> <br />   Lose This Skin - a classical flavored song, full of violins. Sounds like its from the early 1900's classical era. Written by Tymon Dogg, who sings and plays violin throughout the album. <br /> <br />   Charlie Don't Surf - one of the best on the album. the effects give it this beauitful shining underwater sound. The melody is absolutly beautiful. The drums kick in with a \\"surf\\" beat, common in \\"surf rock\\". Great lyrics too, about the US spreading western ways where people don't want them (charlie = the enemy, charlie don't surf and we thing he should.. hu hu?) <br /> <br />   Mensforth Hill - \\"something about england\\" played backwards. but also filled with sound effects and talking, in the vein of the beatles \\"Revolution 9\\". at some parts, it sounds exactly like \\"dark side of the moon\\", specifically \\"on the run\\". <br /> <br />   well, i'm tired of writing now, but the rest of the songs are great too, though, i admit i wish the album ended with a real good song instead of an instrumental. but, its still a masterpice by one of the greatest bands of all time. <br />
B00006JSS8|5.0|Steveland Morris Hardaway started life at Motown in Detroit as \\"Little\\" Stevie Wonder with the tunes \\"Fingertips Pt l & ll. His early mellow hits included \\"For Once in my Life\\" ,My Cherie Amour\\" and \\"You are the Sunshine of my Life\\". \\"Signed,Sealed Delivered Im Yours\\" was later covered by Peter Frampton. You couldn't go to a roller rink in the 70's without skating to \\"Superstition, (later covered by the late great Stevie Ray Vaughn) \\"Living For the City or Higher Ground\\". Even the synthesizer heavy \\"I Just Called to Say I Love You\\" is included  as well as a few tunes that may not be as well known but still enjoyable. Stevie Wonder's career has spanned the decades and his musical styles reflect that.Well done Mr. Wonder.
0307276902|3.0|I can't objectively review this book.<br /><br />As a writer and reader, I found it an interesting story, written in a clear and original voice; it is a stark tale of a harrowing ordeal that culminates in a gut-wrenching ending. As a recovering alcoholic--albeit one with only one paltry year of sobriety--I found it wrong-headed and misguided, a book that might entertain more people than it enriches, a colossal monument hand-built by the author to commemorate his own pride and stubborn self-will.<br /><br />James Frey found himself scraping rock bottom at the ripe young age of 23. Years of Jack Daniels drinkin' and crack smokin' had left him broken in body, mind and soul. Having alienated friends and family, and with no other alternatives but prison or death, he finds himself in rehab at an unnamed clinic in the wilds of Minnesota. (Hazelden, according to those in the know.)<br /><br />\\"A Million Little Pieces\\" chronicles the six weeks he spent there  in blistering, mesmerizing prose shorn of ornament and flourish, shorn, even, of all indentation and most punctuation. An unconventional style, it is nonetheless truly distinctive and perfectly suited to the fevered rhythms of the addiction-addled brain.<br /><br />From the first paragraph, when Frey describes the \\"colorful mixture of spit, snot, urine, vomit and blood\\" on his clothes, it's clear that he's out to write a relentless book about an ugly topic; on subsequent pages, he pummels the reader with powerful descriptions of his chemical cravings, their dire physical consequences, and their root cause, a white-hot anger he refers to as \\"The Fury.\\"<br /><br />In discussing his endless wants and desires, Frey shows some great and true and original insights into the mind of the addict. \\"More than anything, all I have ever wanted is to be close to someone. More than anything, all I have ever wanted is to feel as if I wasn't alone,\\" he says early in the book, in one of the most succinct and profound statements on the spiritual loneliness of the addicted mind I've ever heard, either inside or outside of an AA meeting.<br /><br />Of course, a book based solely on interior monologue would make for a boring read indeed, so Frey has also set this up as a \\"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest\\"-ish struggle between himself and the Powers That Be, a raft of doctors and counsellors all determined to see him follow Their Rules.<br /><br />Herein lies the book's greatest strength as a story--and its greatest weakness as a guide to recovery. For we Americans are conditioned from birth to love stories about the triumph of the will. Not the evil Leni Reifenstahl-ish national will that subjugates continents and burns people in ovens, mind you, but the far more seductive individual will. We love stories about rogue cops disobeying the higher-ups to solve the unsolvable cases; we crave stories about cowboys holstering their smoking six-gun and riding off into the sunset. Hero or anti-hero, John Wayne or Clint Eastwood, it doesn't matter--we prefer the triumph of the individual to the triumph of the collective. We'll watch movies about anonymous soldiers braving the machine guns of Omaha Beach to free Europe from the Nazis, but we much prefer to see Indiana Jones take them on all by himself, armed with nothing but a pistol and a bullwhip. Secretly, we all want to win on our own; secretly, we all want Frank Sinatra singing \\"My Way\\" over the closing credits of our lives.<br /><br />The only problem? That's usually the worst way to fight addictions.<br /><br />Addictions thrive on self will. They love it, they eat it up. Cemetaries and prisons are filled with the wrecked husks of those people who tried to do it Their Way. Most people who aren't addicts or alcoholics don't understand this, and most never will--addicts and alcoholics suffer not from too little willpower, but from too much.<br /><br />Given this fact, the doctors and counsellors in this book--recovering addicts and alcoholics themselves, mindyou--come off not as evil Nurse Ratched clones but as well-meaning would-be helpers, and Frey comes off (to my AA-trained brain, anyway) as immature and wrong in his attitude. For much of the book, he's a child with his hands over his ears screaming to keep any thoughts that aren't his from entering his precious mind, a snarling animal determined to bite the hand that feeds him.<br /><br />The only thoughts he does allow in come from the Tao Te Ching (helpfully given to him by his brother) and from his fellow friends and addicts. Thanks to these things, and thanks to the personal inventory foisted on him by the clinic staff, Frey begins to rid himself of his demons. To me, this was the book's most delicious--and unintentional--irony: while expressing nothing but contempt for AA and the 12 Steps, he ends up following something very much like them, for the principles upon which AA is founded--the planks to which the steps are nailed, if you will--are sturdy enough that he cannot help but use them, even as he denies doing so. There are only so many ways out of the basement.<br /><br />Still, like a cheating grade-school student who copies a dictionary entry and makes superficial changes so he can pass it off as his own work, Frey acts like he's done something original and unique. He hasn't, at least as far as recovery goes; the things he believes to be rebellious and original aren't. Going to a bar, even though you're an alcoholic? I hate to burst your bubble, James, but the Big Book actually says that's OK. Hanging around with other addicts and alcoholics who are also trying to stay sober? That's the core of AA, right there.<br /><br />Make no mistake, I'm glad the author got sober, and I hope those people who read this book and need to get sober will do so. I worry that many will not, for two reasons:<br /><br />1) The 93.41% of alcoholics and/or addicts who haven't hit such a rock-hard rock-bottom will say, \\"I've never done anything THAT bad.\\" (Before AA, that's what I used to say to myself when I read stuff like this book.)<br /><br />2) They, and others, will also say, \\"He got sober without AA, so obviously it isn't necessary.\\" (I also used to say stuff like this to myself.)<br /><br />So buy this book and enjoy it, but do so because it is an entertaining novel, because it may or may not help you recover. Frey makes much of the fact that AA only has a 15% success rate after one year, but as far as I know, that still puts the ratio of lives saved by AA to lives saved by the James Frey program at something like Many Many Thousands : One. If this book does help you get sober, drop me a line and let me know; I'd love to be proven wrong on this one, and I'll gladly change the scoreboard on this review. For now, though, I'll keep going to AA meetings; I tried doing things My Way already, and My Way didn't work. Sobriety is a life-long battle, I've learned, and the quickest way to win is by surrendering.<br /><br />P.S. I wrote this before all the Smoking Gun brouhaha. For my money, I believe the website--they have a strong track record and have never been forced to take down a page because of legal action. There were parts of the book that seemed a little off, but I enjoyed it, so I gave the author the benefit of the doubt.ers, and Frey comes off (to my AA-trained brain, anyway) as immature and wrong in his attitude.

B00000I5Y6|3.0|For musicians with at least eleven albums recorded including a double live offering this mostly classically trained  group is  presented in a very thin offering on this compilation. The biggest problem is that Kansas didn't have a lot of singles released. There were a lot of semi quasi concept albums available. One of my favourite cuts was from the album Leftoverture titled \\"What's on my Mind\\". I think that a reevaluation should be done on Kansas' albums  to flesh out this package to at least eighteen to twenty cuts.
B000BW7QWW|4.0|After a quite confusing beginning (I had not seen the firefly series), I eventually got into this movie and really enjoyed it. Good sci-fi is hard to come by: the scince has to be plausible, the fiction has to be fascinating and it has to somehow make sense as a possible future or alternative reality. So much science fiction falls short in one fo these three categories, but \\"Serenity\\" succeeds on all levels. The cosmology is credible, the story is gripping and the carachters are very enjoyable. It also leaves the door wide open for a sequel, as it seems obvious that there are more adventures to be had in the world of the Alliance, with its many planets and many moons. If there is a sequel I will be first in the queue to see it.<br /><br />Good gripping sci-fi. Well done.
B000B8QEZG|5.0|Hailed as her \\"comeback\\" from the poorly received \\"American Life\\" cd Madonna returns to her roots with the finest dance record in years. Future singles from the album are sure to be \\"Sorry\\" and \\"Jump\\" but the album as a whole is an awesome party record.  You can put it on and go.  Even if you were disappointed in her last few albums give this one a chance.  You will be suprised at how once again she as re-invented herself!!!
B00003CXB7|5.0|To the younger viewers of today. This may not be a movie for you. Because, it does not contain any computer wizardry or special effects. Or a rapping soundtrack. This was war. Or as Hawkeye would quote in the TV series, The war to end all wars?  <br />   One of the most acclaimed comedies. M*A*S*H was about 3 surgeons in the Korean war trying to piece together the bloody bodies of mass distruction with the zany antics that helped keep their sanity intact. This was the starting point for most of the actors and actresses. Donald Sutherland, Tom Skerritt, Elliot Gould, Robert Duvall, Sally Kellerman and Gary Burghoff who played Radar O'Reilly in both the movie and TV series. Trivia note: Ever wonder why Gary always carried a clipboard in one hand? He is missing some fingers. This 2 disc set contains AMC's \\"Backstory\\" behind the scenes documentary, still gallery, theatrical trailer. Plus Background documentary and 30th anniversary M*A*S*H cast reunion! A must for any fan. Also may I suggested the soundtrack. Another great investment!
B00000DFSK|5.0|If you already have any of U2's CDs from the 80's, I wouldn't bother buying this. If you don't though, this is a pretty good place to start. I'd probably recommend just saving up your money and buying all their 80's CD's instead, since all of them are great. This best of CD doesn't completely fill the disc, has edited versions of \\"New Year's Day\\" and \\"Where The Streets Have No Name,\\" and \\"When Love Comes To Town\\" isn't a very good song. The compilation isn't perfect or anything, but it still isn't too bad. I just gave it a 5 star rating because it turned me into a fan. After I listened to all of their songs off the albums, I ended up just making my own best of cd. This is what it looks like.  <br /> <br />1. I Will Follow                 <br />2. A Day Without Me              <br />3. Into The Heart                              <br />4. Gloria                        <br />5. October                                 <br />6. Sunday Bloody Sunday          <br />7. New Year's Day \\"edited version, so one more would fit\\"        <br />8. Two Hearts Beat As One        <br />9. A Sort of Homecoming          <br />10. Pride                        <br />11. The Unforgettable Fire <br />12. Where The Streets Have No Name <br />13. I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For <br />14. With Or Without You <br />15. Red Hill Mining Town \\"This is probably the most underated song from The Joshua Tree, but it's the best one!\\" <br />16. Desire <br />17. Angel Of Harlem <br />18. All I Want Is You <br />19. The Sweetest Thing \\"single remix\\" <br />                         <br />It fills the disc over 79 minutes and it gives a way better representation of the them! ...Oh yeah, I wouldn't bother buying U2's Best of 1990-2000. It's put together even worse. I'd just get Achtung Baby and download the song \\"Hold Me, Thrill Me, Kiss Me, Kill Me\\" instead.  <br />
B000B7BRMM|5.0|Somehow I'd missed out on Krall over the years. I heard one of the tracks from this item in my car and was impressed. I bought the CD and find her interpretation of the well-known songs refreshing; so impressive and refreshing that I have now bought five  of her earlier CD's. What a great find for me ! Her swing is such that until I read up on her I could not tell whether she was a black or white singer.Can't think of a better standard !!!
B000BW7QWW|3.0|It doesn't live up to the series.  The series is funnier + more entertaining.  This movie seems rushed.   <br /> <br />It is a great action movie however.  Seems like they crammed more action in and left out more of the story.
0689853637|5.0|I have a few people on my holiday list who gets his latest book every year. They will definitly love this one. The animals are amazing, the waterfall actually shimmers and the little house at the end is just too cute!
B000AMJG4Y|5.0|i watched the movie in japanese with english subtitles and absoulutley loved it! It was the best! It stuck to the story and the characters. The only thing that i don't understand is why is it available at Amazon in 2010. It really doesn't take that long to make it over. It usually takes a year or 2 to put in subtitles or dub it. but taking 5 years?.....geez..... Do any of you know why it will take that long to make it over?
0312995423|1.0|And might I say I am a BIG FAN of Dan Brown...<br />I have read 4 books from him and loved them all, apart from this one..<br /><br />I guess this has something to do that is one of the first ones he wrote and he did not have the \\"Dan Brows's\\" way of telling story..<br /><br />Anyway, this is definattely predictable, which is way off his way of writing nowadays. This book got carried away at the hype after he became a best seller, but trust a fan...<br /><br />This is not a good book from Dan Brown..<br />You would definatelly enjoy Da Vinci Code, Angel's & Demons, Deception Point and others...<br />Oh, I do love computers and not even that helped me like the book more, with the story evolving among this subject..<br />:-(
B0006L16N8|4.0|A very solid yet ethereal album.  Unfortunately for me, the tracks seemed to all mesh together without much discernment as to the change in the track.  This probably wasn't helped by my reading a book while giving it a first few listens.  It definitely has growing power, and it did grow on me.  I recommend the last bonus track, as well as \\"Fix You.\\"
0671027387|5.0|Do any of you like Tom Clancy's books ??<br />Then will you be amazed on what happens with this book from Dan Brown...<br /><br />Great Story, surprising characters and plot.<br />Besides beeing a big fan of him after reading 4 books, I think this one is among the best of the them.<br /><br />Could not put it down until I finished it!!<br />A very good script for a Hollywood Movie on this one as well.<br />:-)
B0000UJL96|4.0|\\"The Undiscovered Country\\" is the last time we see the original crew together in the same film, and it's good stuff.  It's almost enough to wash the taste of Star Trek V out of your mouth.  Bringing back Nicholas Meyer (from Wrath of Khan) to direct is the first thing they got right.  Both of Meyer's Trek films seem to have deeper themes than any of the other Trek films.  \\"Khan\\" dealt with the aging crew and fears of death.  \\"Country\\" deals with the line between peace and prejudice.  While Khan is the clearly better film, \\"Country\\" is effective at it's least successful times and quite good at it's most.   <br /> <br />Every schoolchild knows that the Klingons are just the wrinkly-foreheaded, intergalactic cousins of Soviets, so it's natural that, since the Wall came down in real life, the Wall would come down in the Trek universe.  Of course, the Enterprise crew is put on the most important assignment of escorting the Klingon leader to negotiations.  And, of course, things don't go down so well.  It's up to Kirk to see through his prejudices to kick the asses in the way of peace.  The ending's hoaky but gloriously fun to anyone into Trek.  If you can hold back a smile when Scotty busts in, what kind of green-blooded, pointy-eared lamebrain are you? <br /> <br />Good thiller, Terrific for Trek fans.
0385513755|5.0|Pointless to mention about the story that has involded many...<br />The plot of the story is great with a brilliant idea behind it.<br /><br />I must say that reading the Da Vinci Code made me go after some answers and start reading other books as well from many different authors related to Religious Facts back in history...<br /><br />As for the Ilustrated Edition, it is definatelly a MUST HAVE IT.<br />It will make our reading even more pleaseant and helpfull to locate the events at the story.<br /><br />Loved and recomend it...

B000BMSTMS|4.0|Look: I'M not afraid to type under my username and not under a kid's review like some of you wimps.  <br /> <br />But let's get started with my review of the new Korn CD See You on the Other Side. This CD came out on 12-6 (and I had no clue until I went to K-Mart and strolled electronics just for the hell of it) and they now are on Virgin Records. They lost Brain Welch because he loves religion now and that's just great. And now, this group called The Matrix join up with Atticus Ross and Jonathan Davis to produce the CD. <br /> <br />This sounds like a home made batch of trouble right? <br /> <br />Relax and take it easy people. It's not bad at all: in fact it allows Korn to become more artistic then ever before. That was seen coming on in the 2003 release of \\"Take A Look in the Mirror\\" and it bears a stronger sediment here. It isn't the hardest Korn album in the catalog, and compared to Issues and Untouchables this sounds like a Backstreet Boys album, but face it: the act was getting tiring. And with the success of Davis in the Queen of the Damned soundtrack, and then Fieldy releasing his own gangsta rap CD, it only became a matter of time before they would revitalize their act. <br /> <br />Now, I have listened to each song at least two times and some of the better ones on here more like seven or eight times: it becomes appearent after a while that Korn acts like they are selling out but it's hardly true at all. Songs like \\"Hypocrites,\\" \\"Politics,\\" \\"Coming Undone,\\" and \\"Throw Me Away,\\" could easily work onto any previous Korn CD. \\"Twisted Transistor,\\" while sounding like a trendy dance song, still maintains low guitar lines in certain spots which will make it a radio hit for Korn. \\"Souvenir,\\" \\"Getting Off,\\" \\"10 or a 2-way,\\" and \\"Open Up,\\" are good songs from any other band, but are further proof from Korn haters or pesmatic diehards that they are sellouts while \\"Liar\\" is in the middle of both roads: trendy and hard. \\"Seen it All,\\" \\"For No One,\\" and \\"Love Song\\" show the strength of pre-SYOTOS Korn and the Korn in limbo with the new producers. But to be throughly HONEST, I have no idea what the hell they were trying to pull with the cover of \\"Tearjerker.\\" Not only was it a terrible cover, but it was a terrible song to pick and even worse one to end the CD with. Whoever was in charge of that idea needs kicked in the teeth. <br /> <br />But when all is said and done, there is not as bad as these \\"people\\" claim it is. However, the same people who come onto Amzaon and rate it 5-stars and say it's the best Korn yet are well off with the 1-star reviewers. I give it 4-stars in reality if I had half stars it would get 3.5 it's a good CD don't get me wrong, but the sudden commitment to being cool and trendy and that god awful ending debacle of a song drag it down 1.5 stars.
B000286RKW|5.0|This isn't my favorite Scorsese film, but it's still pretty damn great, and is perhaps the best mafia film I've ever seen.  The silly though often dramatically effective romananticizing of the mafia that you'd find in 'The Godfather' or 'Once Upon a Time in America' is completely missing here, and we see gangsters for what they almost certainly are, mere amoral creeps at best, and utterly sociopathic maniacs at worst.  This is a courageously unconventional film, as it is largely a biography, and  thus largely without a particular plot, and is completely devoid of any likable characters.  But, it's always interesting, often fascinating and frequently disturbing, and Scorsese creates a consistent sense of believability and reality, even as the events fall well outside the range of our experience.  Still, though Scorsese manages to shape the film in a way that makes it seem somewhat more purposeful and deliberate despite the lack of a central plot, it does have a slightly anti-climactic ending.  Simply put, Hill's sudden downfall is quite a bit less intriguing that his rise.  But, what are you gonna do, that's the way it happened. (More or less, anyway.  I don't know enough of the real details to say how many liberties Scorsese took with the facts, but I'll assume that this has the gist of 'em, anyway.)  The acting is uniformly top-notch, with special note going to Pesci as the murderous Tommy.  He's certainly one of the most unnerving characters to come along in the 90's, and he really seems to embody what I'm told is a sociopath.  He doesn't even kill because he likes to, precisely, he just does it because he just can't relate to others as human.  The suffering of others means absolutely nothing to him, and thus he has no reason to restrain himself other than how it might effect him later.  This is probably the scariest personality type: someone who seems kinda normal most of the time, but who is in fact a complete fraud, a fraud who doesn't really believe in any of the social constructions of the world, but fakes it to get by.  Henry himself is an interesting character, as he displays an unusual detachment from everything around him, as I suppose would true of a great many career criminals.  Being a criminal is just what he does.<br /><br />Authenticity is significant to the narrative, so this film lacks the surreal flavoring of some of Scorsese's classic work, but he still manages enough flair to keep interesting, largely in the form of some long, elaborate tracking shots, a bit of schizoid editing and some sudden freeze frames to go with the narration.  He also pulls the old using pop-songs from the era trick, but for once this just seems to be a natural outcropping of the setting, rather than an gratuitous, distracting device.<br /><br />Certainly, this isn't a film for everyone.  Again, no one is remotely likable, except maybe Paulie, who displays a wee bit more honor than most of the figures, and it's got plenty of graphic, callous violence.  It's not that gory, really, but the cold approach to it will doubtless effect many.  Still, if you're looking for an unconventional look at a disturbing unusual world that is still frighteningly close to home, you can't go wrong with 'Goodfellas'.<br /><br />Grade: A-the social constructions of the world, but fakes it to get by.

044024157X|4.0|Mississippi's Ford County local weekly newspaper hangs on the edge of bankruptcy and Willie Traynor, a rather shiftless ne'er do well college dropout, hears from a chum that a publication like the Ford County Times would be a veritable license to print money if it were properly run. With the help of a $50,000 loan from his doting grandmother, Willie assumes the ownership of the newspaper and begins the process of pulling the newspaper from its deep hole. Things are definitely looking up and readership is given an enormous boost with his lurid, sensational coverage of the trial of local bad boy, Danny Padgitt, for the brutal rape and murder of Rhoda Kasselaw, a reclusive young widow. With the assistance of a shocking in court threat of revenge against the members of the jury if he is convicted, Padgitt is sent to prison for life and Ford County resumes the role of a sleepy-eyed southern town living its languid 1970 life.<br /><br />As I read the entire middle half of the book, I found it quite easy to forget that Grisham made his name as an author writing legal thrillers. Grisham treats us to an extended commentary on life in a typical southern community during the decade of the 70s. He deals with racial prejudice, hatred, fear and the legal issues of bussing and de-segregation in a calm, straight up and quite fearless almost documentary approach. His very human characters of Calia and Esau Ruffin, a black couple that live on the wrong side of the tracks, allow us to see and acknowledge the historical wrongs and injustices that were visited upon the black population in the Deep South without standing up on an annoying soap box and yelling about it. The stereotypical white old boy's network is represented by the notorious Padgitt family, Lucien Willbanks, their extraordinarily slimy lawyer and Mackey Don Coley, the sheriff who has made a career of ignoring the Padgitt family's wrongdoings. Nixon's politics, the struggles the US faced attempting to extricate itself from the Vietnam debacle, conscientious objectors and returning veterans all make an appearance. Clearly, this fine piece of writing was also a metaphor for the time that Padgitt was in prison. Padgitt and the brutal murder simply vanish from the collective psyche of Ford County. As we read this story, we are SUPPOSED to forget about him just as the community did until we are shocked to discover he has been released on parole after only nine years and the jurors who sent him to prison begin to die.<br /><br />At the risk of sounding like a literary snob, I'd like to suggest that Grisham has moved up a very large notch. With The Last Juror, he has proven his ability to write compelling human drama that doesn't rely upon simple chills and thrills to make the reader turn the pages. I believe this is the finest effort from an author who already has a pretty commendable body of work to his credit!<br /><br />Paul Weissetnam debacle, conscientious objectors and returning veterans all make an appearance.

B000B8QF14|4.0|Considering this is Green Day's first live album there could have been more older material. Don't get me wrong, I love the new album and it is some of their best. However, considering this is Green Day's first live album it would have been nice to listen to a lot more older songs.
B000002JR8|5.0|This CD could possibly be the best CD in metal history....well in the 90's....that or Vulgar Display of Power....Pantera is soo f*ckin in your face, and straight the the point metal....its great..Phil can scream and sing...his singing is amazing, and he can scream his ass off too....\\"5 Minutes Alone\\" is one of the best songs.  My favorite song on this CD...Dime's guitar playing is friggin awesome, and very talented...Vinnie's drumming is fast and great...Rex is a badass on the bass <br />overall, great buy and it is well worth the money...i would give it more stars if i could..

B00005JNTX|5.0|I only expected good things when I heard that there would be a film adaptation of Frank Miller's \\"Sin City\\" graphic novels, and after seeing this movie I can safely say that it was above and beyond even what I thought it could be. Robert Rodriguez really brings Miller's frantic and colorful (although not necessarily in the film, no pun intended) world to life, and makes the lines between comic and movie blur. Everything from the story to the cast of characters is nothing short of stellar as far as \\"Sin City\\" is concerned. Add in some outrageous (and sometimes gruesome) special effects, and a guest directing spot by the heralded Quentin Tarantino, and you have the formula for one of the best and most original movies to hit the silver screen in years. Short of nothing, this is a must see for fan's of Miller, Rodriguez and Tarantino, and the Sin City series. <br /> <br />The story may be somewhat confusing to some as it does jump around a bit (thanks to guest man Tarantino's patented directing style), but most should be able to piece everything together because it all relates to one giant overview in the end. The cast is perfect for the movie. There is really not one person from this film that I would take out, or anyone else I would add. You have the obvious eye candy of starlets like Jessica Alba (Nancy), Britanny Murphy (Shellie) and Rosario Dawson (Gail) to hold over the audience, while, well known actors like Bruce Willis (Hartigan), Mickey Rourke (Marv) and Clive Owen (Dwight) give the film plenty of credibility. The characters are developed wonderfully, and each has their own agenda/means for being in the film (like many I will never look at Elijah Wood the same way again). The story flows well actually for jumping around a bit, but that is what gives the film its special feel, and one that makes the viewer know this is a worthwhile experience. Without revealing too much of the plot line of the movie (which trust me you will want to find out for yourself as it is so good) the film basically takes from three of Miller's graphic novels, \\"The Big Fat Kill\\", \\"That Yellow Bastard\\" and \\"The Hard Goodbye\\", which if you have read any of the comics or novels you will probably be familiar with. Marv (Rourke) spent the night with the woman of his dreams, a hooker named Goldie, only to awake and find her dead of the bed next to him. Being framed for the murder, Marv escapes and vows to find out who indeed killed Goldie. Along with that Hartigan (Willis) has just awakened from his injuries he suffered while saving Nancy (Alba) when she was a child, only to meet back up with Nancy, who is now stripping at a popular night club. And all the while Dwight is trying to protect the city's prostitution brigade, after they mistakenly kill an officer. The way that the story fits together works almost perfectly considering that going from one frame to the other is not exactly the easiest thing to do. <br /> <br />About those who have complained about the movie. I've noticed that most people who have given this movie bad reviews or trashed it have concentrated on two major points : the violence and the unrealistic events. As far as the violence goes, yes Sin City is extremely, extremely graphic. However if you were to take any of this away from the movie, everything \\"Sin City\\" was centered around would falls to pieces. Not to say the movie is dependent on its violent content, but in reality these stories come from comics which are most of the time graphic in nature (don't even ask about graphics novels). The violence though is very cartoon-like, so I can't really imagine anyone being genuinely offended for seeing a bloody character appear on the screen. As for the unrealistic qualities the movie has, like I said it comes from a comic book series. I'm guessing a lot of people who have complained this movie either don't know this, or haven't read comics/graphics novels. Basically the movie portrays what happens in the novels to a T, and complainingor trashing the movie for being unrealistic or violent shows not only close-mindedness, but an unwillingness to accept that there are other ways to create authentic ideas. At some point people have to learn how to suspend their disbelief. <br /> <br />\\"Sin City\\" was and still is easily one of the most pleasurable viewing experiences to come along in quite some time. If you are a fan of the Sin City series, or any other movies which Rodriguez and Tarantino have been involved in, you are in for a spectacular treat, because this is definitely among the best films that either has been a part of. If you have no idea about any of what I have said or you haven't seen or even heard about anything related to the two directors, this is still a worthwhile movie to see, if only for it's uniqueness. There's plenty of interesting plot developments, likeable/ hate-worthy characters, and stunning effects to hold almost any viewer over. There's not much more I can say, except that you should really see this movie. Do so right away.
0060005424|5.0|Lirael is an amazing book.  It is a fantasy full of adventure that constantly kept me on the edge of my seat.  I had read SABRIEL a few months before I purchased this book, and I was a little nervous because I loved Sabriel and was afraid Garth Nix would try to replace her with Lirael.  However, all my worries were pointless as LIRAEL is a completely different story, set in the same world as SABRIEL, and Sabriel herself still has a fairly large role in the book.  I recommend LIRAEL to all book fans.

B000002UB6|5.0|The Beatles' break up in 1970 was headline news all over the world. The boys had been working nonstop for 8 years straight, producing number one albums one after another and maintaining the title of the most important band in the world. However, the abrupt breakup left an album worth of songs unfinished in Apple studios. Producer Phil Spector took the job to complete what was to become the Beatles' final album Let It Be, released in the spring that year.    Let It Be is unique in that it is, after all, the last album by The Beatles. You sense a lack of chemistry especially between Paul and John on the first track I Got A Feeling, where Paul is singing the chorus and John enters with \\"everybody had a hard year...\\" which sounds like a completely different song altogether. However, the Beatles succeed in revisiting their sound from the early 60's in One After 909, a song that can fit well on A Hard Day's Night, while Paul and John seem to put away their differences and settle down on Two Of Us, an incredible duet between the two most famous songwriting partners in history. Individually, three of the Beatles offer their traditional dosage of tunes. Lennon offers Across The Universe, which has become one of his greatest contributions to the Beatles catalogue. Harrison rocks it out good on I Me Mine. McCartney, on the other hand, gives the album the theme song Let It Be, which became a soundtrack song of the generation, The Long And Winding Road, and the awesome rocker Get Back.     With Let It Be, the world lost their most gifted rock band forever (the murder of Lennon in 1980 drew the curtain on the possibility of the fab four ever getting back together), and the soundtrack of an entire generation came to a close.     Recommended    A
B000AP04FG|5.0|This movie is completely action packed, so for those who loves action films, this one is for you.  Lots of guns and explosions, and even a bit of fist fights between Brad and Angelina.  The two have great chemistry on screen.  Brad and Angelina have tons and tons of high tech guns and ammo to attempt to kill each other with.  There are a lot of wow's and a good amount of humor.  It's a good movie for any occasion -- for a date, or a casual movie to kill time with.
0312263120|5.0|Digital Fortress, by Dan Brown, was one of the best books I have ever read.  Although a little slow at first, the action picks up almost immediately.  Dan Brown draws you in using tantalizing characters and an ingenious plot.  You're drawn into right up to the point where you are racing the clock right along with Susan and David to find the key, the murderer, and each other. <br />I would recommend Digital Fortress to anyone who enjoys a good action-packed mystery novel.  Anyone who enjoys trying to beat the characters to the answer of the novel's mystery.  Overall, this is an awesome book that I would recommend to anyone who enjoys reading. <br />
B0000028M7|5.0|First off I would like to respond to that Melissa Girl. everyone is entiled to there own opinion. But let's get some facts straight. first off this album was released in 1992. godsmack did not release an album until 1997. Godsmack used to be a cover band for Alice In Chains until they got a record label deal. Godsmack did not release a platinum album until 2002 the year Layne Staley frontman of AIC died. And Godsmack is not the only band who was influenced the most by AIC. other knock offs are Staind, Pearl Jam, Nickelback, Creed, Alterbridge, Stone Temple Pilots, and Velvet Revolver. Next to The Beatles, Alice in Chains are the most influncing sound herd among other artists. also Alice In Chains are the only band in the history of forever to release an EP (Jar of Flies), that debuted at number 1. One could argue that Jar of Flies is the best EP ever released. AIC is also the first Grunge band to release a platinum album. They were also the second band in the 90's to release a platinum album. (first was Jane's Addiction's album Ritual de lo Habitul.) and finishing this up, The Sun logo was thought up by Guitarist Jerry Cantrell and Drummer Sean Kinney in late 1991. I do like Godsmack but they are defeintly the biggest Alice In Chains Wannabe ever. Personally Melissa I hope you read this review I have read all of yours and I can easily tell you only listen to brand new stuff you have no class or taste. And btw I read your review for American Idiot and noticed u dissed RATM, Green Day would never exist if it wern't for them. And how do you consider Good Charolette to be \\"Hard\\" there I am done making you look foolish now to discuss this absolutey amazing album. <br /> <br />Dirt is one my favorite albums of all time. Most of the spots are held by Nine Inch Nails, AIC, Led Zeppelin, Rage Against the Machine, and Metallica. every song is a wonder. Every one of these songs belong on a greatest hits album. here is my review for each song in order, <br /> <br />1. Them Bones. 9.5/10. a great way to start the album. Short but a sensation. good solo, clever lyrics. Very catchy. Got a lot of airplay and still alot today. <br /> <br />2. Dam That River. 8/10. It is not possible to listen to just a clip of this song. It is very catchy. Good guitar work. Little airplay back in the day but none now. <br /> <br />3. Rain When I Die. 7.5/10. Good song but a little to long. This is the best demonstrtion of Mike Starr's bass playing abilities. No airplay ever. <br /> <br />4. Down in a Hole. 10/10. This is where it gets good. Kind of a chic song but truly amazing. Incredible lyrics. \\" I've eaten the sun so my tounge has been burned of the taste\\" These days musicians would just say \\"I Can't Taste\\". short solo but decent. <br />This is almost every girls favorite AIC song. Tons of airplay it was like the fifth hit off this album. not as much airplay today but you might hear it occasionaly. <br /> <br />5. Sickman. 5.5/10. This is my least favorite song on the album. Not very catchy but don't let it discourage you from buying this album. No airplay <br /> <br />6. Rooster. 10/10. This song will never go off the radio. Everyone has herd this song. The video was never aired because it was to graphic but it is available somewhere. This tells about the horrors of Vietnam. I belive this was the third hit. <br /> <br />7. Junkhead. 10/10. My personal favorite off this album. No Airplay but very good. Tells about Drugs controling your mind. <br />I love this song. <br /> <br />8. Dirt. 8/10. This is the self titled track from this album. Another tale of Drug Abuse. Sounds kind of Egyptian but very neat. No airplay ever. <br /> <br />9. God Smack. 9/10. Here it is the great wonder of who thought of the name first. Well AIC duh I'm not going to get into this agian. Good song, neat guitar. i could be wrong but I think I herd it on the radio once. <br /> <br />10. Intro. Just an intro to next song. <br /> <br />11. Hate To Feel. 9.5/10  Very, Very, Very, VeryCool. Once agian a story about the relief from drugs. This song is mostly a vocal song. No Airplay. <br /> <br />12. Angry Chair. 10/10. Perhaps one of the catchiest songs ever. A huge hit with lots of airplay but not as much today. Good Solo. Very Dark too. <br /> <br />13. Would?. 10/10. Although it is the last song on the album it was the first radio single. this song put AIC on the map. Good Bass, Good Drums, Good Guitar, and Amazing Vocals. One may argue that this is AIC's best song. Truly Incredible. And a bunch of airplay, <br /> <br /> <br />
B00005JOIF|4.0|MUNICH is a powder keg.  It is a film that is so steeped in controversy not because of its content, but because of who made it.  The most famous director in Hollywood, Steven Spielberg, has crafted a film that is so brave not because of its content but because of its point of view.  This film is about Israel and it's ongoing conflict with the people of Palestine, and it doesn't paint a pretty picture of anyone involved.<br /><br />In 1972 thousands of athletes and spectators poured into Munich to celebrate and compete in another Olympics.  All was well until 11 Israeli athletes were taken hostage by a terrorist faction called Black September.  All 11 men were killed.  In its aftermath the Israeli government hired five Mosad agents to go undercover and kill the 11 men who were responsible.<br /><br />The film follows Avner (Eric Banner) the leader of this group on his mission to get revenge for the Munich Olympics. Avner is a regular guy placed in a position that at first seems justifiable.  But as the body count gets higher and he finds himself justifying more and more killings, we the audience are left wondering if the ends really do justify the means.  Were the Black September terrorists really evil and uncaring or were they men without voices trying to make somebody listen?  Is revenge really the best weapon?  Does killing those responsible end the real violence? MUNICH poses questions and leaves the audience to sort out the answers.<br /><br />MUNICH is not a film about the battle between good and evil.  It's a film about evil fighting an  even worse evil.  It's about human futility and about how vengeance doesn't solve a problem it only makes it worse.  It's about corrupt Nationalism and corrupt ideals  that turn good people into monsters and the corrupt governments that penalize the monsters they've created.  But at the heart its about the regular guys who are fighting turf wars with regular guys and how given the right circumstances we all have the potential to do evil masquerading as good.<br /><br />And yet trying to nail down the intentions of Munich is quite difficult.  You certainly can't cheer Avner.  He's no hero, but you also can't fault him for his outrage.  His countrymen were killed senselessly, why shouldn't his people retaliate?  Why shouldn't the terrorists pay for their sins?<br /><br />The major flaw and yet its strongest attribute it that it fails to take a side.  It fails to define just what evil is.  It allows the audience to watch from a distance and doesn't attempt to drown the audience in political correctness.  But can these warring factions both be right?  Is there ever an end?  Where does America fit into the story?  Does America's support of the state of Israel make us culpable?  The film shies away from those answers (except in the final shot that speaks far more than any in this film).  Is that a good thing? I don't really know, what I do know is that this is the kind of film that will put people on both sides of the Israel/Palestine conflict on the defensive.  If you think strongly one way or the other MUNICH will anger you.<br /><br />I applaud Spielberg for the brave choice of choosing an Israeli as the focal point of the story.  If this had been about the Palestinians it would have been so easy (at least for me) to accept the Arab people as the villain and the Jewish people as victims.  But at the end aren't both sides Victim's of each others misguided Nationalism? It's easy to paint terrorists as the evil party.  But good and evil are never black and white and sometimes bad things happen on both sides.  But revenge never gets us anywhere, and Munich shows us characters that are so normal becoming Monsters.  They may be justified in their anger but are not helping the situation.  This is a bold position to take.<br /><br />MUNICH is not a black and white film and it should be dissected.  IT should be discussed and it should be a lesson to those who see the issues of Israel's right to exist, not as a black and white thing but as a problem that will only go away when both parties wake up and take responsibility for their hate and anger.  The ongoing tensions in the middle east will not be solved by American guns but by the people of the middle east putting down the guns and asking for forgiveness from each other.  Would that ever happen?  Will the fighting ever end?  Not until someone can fix the darkness in every human heart.<br /><br />Post-script: After writing this review I must say that the film MUNICH is inspired by actual events and that my comment are not meant to be skewed either right or left.  The current problems in the Middle East are numerous and complicated and I myself only know very little.  The above review are my thoughts after viewing the film MUNICH and not on the people of ISRAEL and/or PALESTINE.  I believe they both have a right to exist and be defended, and I pray for peace in that region.rael's right to exist, not as a black and white thing but as a problem that will only go away when both parties wake up and take responsibility for their hate and anger.

B00008NRL8|5.0|For all of those who still think the tango is only tradition, there are bad news. Astor Piazolla was the untiring stalker who renewed and even widened the frontiers locals of a badly seen dance in the Twenties (As a matter of fact, Jorge Luis Borges termed it once a brothel `s reptile) and considered as a simple curiosity of sensuality 's exercise to become an authentic referential evidence, a musical genre that dressed showy clothes, expanding its action radius toward new horizons.<br /><br />This recent ensemble has know to employ the essential roots of the forbidden fruit, blending it with new musical inflexions and enraptured hues. And more than a simple revenge, I think it constitutes a true revaluation of the expressive possibilities of a musical genre that only can be understood from the wise perspective wedged by Maria Luisa Bemberg a very gifted filmmaker who expressed accurately a painful true: \\"The Argentine 's tragedy turns around the fact is seen as a Latin American in Europe and an European in Latin America.\\" That duality is even worst than a simple emigration or a banishment: I would term The Flying Dutchman 's syndrome, conceived as the incapacity to enroot with the land.<br /><br />The crown track of the album is the fantastic version of the Last Tango in Paris, but there is still more to enjoy.<br /><br />If you are still grasped the old concept of the tango as the elemental desperate anguish `s scream of unfinished passions, please remember this smart statement of Gustav Mahler: \\"Traditionalism is negligence.\\"

B00005JLEU|5.0|Firstly, Spirited Away won an American Oscar for best animated film, not to mention other awards earned around the world. Secondly, there are few places where you can find a professional review that actually says something bad about this movie, and if you do it's because that reviewer obviously doesn't understand anime as its fans do. Spirited Away is one of the top films ever, in my book. It blends everything that makes a story great, including lovable characters, a magical world, and a story that will melt you from the inside it's so warm. Plus, it appeals to both adults and children.<br /><br />The story centers around a little girl named Chihiro who's in the middle of a move to another part of Japan, and she obviously isn't happy about it. But during the drive to her new home, her parents take a pit stop and they end up in a deserted city. Only this city isn't as deserted as they think, and they are suddenly drawn deeper into the city by the delights it offers. Chihiro, ever the pessimist, doesn't partake in all the delights her parents do, thus saving her from the curse placed upon them, but that also leaves her alone in this new world of magical monsters and spirits. All she can do to save herself, and hopefully her parents, is work for the master of a bathhouse. During her time in this world she meets a strange boy--who is also a dragon--that seems somehow familiar to her. It's her meeting with the dragon that ends up changing the place she made for herself in this world, and so starts her adventure to save the ones most dear to her.<br /><br />As is the wont of Miyazaki, he places a young girl at the head of the story, and kind of lets her tell it, only in this case Chihiro is by far the weakest of his female leads. It's fun to watch her grow and change into something she wasn't before. This story is filled with symbolism and themes, which means it must be paid attention to, as there is something to be learned in this film. That makes it ideal to both children and adults alike.<br /><br />Disney did an excellent job with the DVD as well, and the obvious love put into this film becomes apparent after watching the documentaries on the disc. The voice actors and those responsible for getting the rights to the film put everything they had into it, and it shows.<br /><br />This is an anime for everyone, and I'd recommend it just that way. Everyone should see this movie. If we could accept anime as easily as we do other types of entertainment, Spirited Away could become a film as legendary as the Wizard of Oz or Disney's classic Alice in Wonderland, as it shares traits from both.ildren and adults alike.  <br /> <br />Disney did an excellent job with the DVD as well, and the obvious love put into this film becomes apparent after watching the documentaries on the disc.

B00005JO1J|5.0|I must admit, this is NOT the well put together movie we were all hoping for (thanks Columbus), but it is still in my opinion the best one out there. The storyline is just....wow. The music is literally the best I have heard in my life, kudos to mister Larson. Although I find the music to be better in this one, I don't find the singing up to par with the musical. Rosario Dawson as Mimi is an excellent choice, as is Tracey Thoms as Joanne, but not as good as Daphne Ruben-Vega, or Freddi Walker. The singing in the musical, is overall better, though Rosario and Tracey have clearer voices, Daphnie's rather raspy has always been Mimi to me, and always will be. So if you're getting the soundtrack, get the OBCR. The only exception to my opinion, is La Vie Boheme, the extra music and guitar parts....wow. The only things I would say could have made this movie better would have been ALL the original cast members, and if the whole movie was in song (as the musical was). But we can't get everything we want. But, I say that this is a GREAT movie, get it when its released on DVD, or atleast RENT it.

It's really rare to me that I can really feel the meaning and emotion of the lyrics that the artist sings and even to empathize with them. Chris Martin is an awesome lyrics writter and it shows with this album.
B000BEZQ18|5.0|Just as he proved with last year's soundtrack for Walter Salles's \\"The Motorcycle Diaries\\", Argentinean composer Gustavo Santaolalla has a seemingly unerring gift for evoking the spirit of a movie without the convenience of the visual element. Director Ang Lee's film version of Annie Proulx's \\"Brokeback Mountain\\" is a splendid, deeply felt work, and the accompanying musical score contributes a great deal to the haunting atmosphere of the story. Acoustic guitar-strummed instrumentals alternate effectively with fresh performances of country-western songs, both old and new. The result is not a weepy replication of the story's sadly downbeat themes but a well-rounded compass for the evolution of the movie's plot.<br /><br />The usual suspects are certainly included here as far as the performers go, but the pieces gain an unusually resonance within the context of the film's soundtrack. Willie Nelson does a heartbreaking take on Bob Dylan's \\"He Was a Friend of Mine\\", and Emmylou Harris sings one of Santaolalla's new compositions (with lyrics by Elton John's longtime partner, Bernie Taupin), a wondrously tender ballad called \\"A Love That Will Never Grow Old\\", with her trademark purity intact. Rufus Wainwright lends a plaintive, campfire ballad of his own with \\"The Maker Makes\\", and he partners effectively with Teddy Thompson on a leisurely cover of Roger Miller's classic, \\"King of the Road\\". Thompson solos on another Santaolalla-Taupin song, the sweet, \\"I Don't Want to Say Goodbye\\", and Mary McBride does a nice Patsy Cline-like turn on another slow-dance number by Santaolalla, \\"No One's Gonna Love You Like Me\\".<br /><br />The pace quickens with Steve Earle's honky-tonk \\"The Devil's Right Hand\\", Jackie Green's two-stepper take on \\"I Will Never Let You Go\\", the Gas Band's uncanny impression of the Charlie Daniels Band on \\"An Angel Went Up in Flames\\", and perhaps the only throwaway track, Linda Ronstadt's overfamiliar 1974 cover of Buddy Holly's \\"It's So Easy\\". Breaking away from his Latin-based rhythms, Santaolalla proves to be a gifted, versatile composer, and even with stellar vocal performances, it is really his instrumental interludes that evoke the poignancy of the story the most. Until the DVD comes out, this CD will help you remember why the movie is so amazing. Read Proulx's short story. See Lee's movie. And then listen to Santaolalla's score. The combination is transcendent.ased rhythms, Santaolalla proves to be a gifted, versatile composer, and even with stellar vocal performances, it is really his instrumental interludes that evoke the poignancy of the story the most.

B0007GAEW6|5.0|For years now I have waided through the mass of mass produced music. I've waited patiently for someone to break the mold, burn it, and throw it away. The time has come. These guys are a pleasant departure. I have read some reviews that disect them as in an autopsy. To those folks, go buy some Britney Spears and leave us alone. Mars Volta with its ethereal heavy hypnotic sounds is a welcome and overdue guest in my musical library. Is every second of the album perfect? No! I think that's the point. If the Beatles, Zeplin, Pink Floyd, and even Rush didn't exist until now - this is what they would be doing. If you loved the Chameleons UK in the 80's, this album is a must for you. It is a flavor of layered folds of sounds that Tool fans know. Mars Volta has obviously a frequent visitor to the theoretical musical edge. A pond not often fished in. No word whether he may return. With these thick and hypnotic sounds of dreamscapes, I hope that they pad locked the door back into the musical box that so many recent bands wallow in. Buy this album. And don't skip tracks. Turn off the lights, close your eyes and maybe you can see. Enjoy!
B000002KBU|5.0|The loveliness of Joni has always been her understanding of the vulvnerabilities, mystery and confusion of life amidst the honesty of her lyrics and bittersweet beauty of her tunes..portraying existence as some wonderous revealation...<br /><br />Indeed these remasters (hdcd) are refreshing.This cd may be her finest but she is best approached as an album artist rather then a single maker and I equally think Court and Spark,Ladies Of The Canyon,Hejira,Hissing all stand up on their own but this Blue is the one that she will be remembered by.<br /><br />Great Hippie songwriters and musicians accompany her here,James Taylor, Stephen Stills and what is funny I recall the UK Glam era rockers covering her This Flight Tonight....You can get some great live renditions of some of these cuts on her Misles Of Aisles which is a nice segue into her later period fusing a jazz sensibility into her older hits and music.
B0009353IW|5.0|Even without all the intriguing and rich, historical L.A. context, this joyous and infectious collection stands on its own...Like just about everything Ry Cooder lends his guitar and sensibility to, it is infused with magic!
B000BZ9DKW|5.0|Don't listen to this other idiot.  You CAN'T find them at BestBuy anymore.  Snatch one up here while you can!  It's a great deal considering they're disappearing as I type.    Buy from brandzmovies.  He's got the best prices and best customer service.
B000BMSTMS|4.0|Kudo's to the band for exploring and inviting new production talent for See You On The Other Side. The heaviliy produced arrangement and writing collaboration from The Matrix and Atticus Ross is obvious to any person that is familiar with Korn's older material. I found it refreshing. My favorite track is Tearjerker. It was dark and full of texture. I enjoyed Jonathan Davis's slow melodic singing that I hope he will continue exploring in the future. My only concern with this new material is that Korn will not be effective in \\"pulling off\\" the heavily produced sequencing that is evident in the recording. If Korn fails to do this then it will be a great dissapointment to new listeners, past fans and music critics worldwide.  I've seen other bands like Nine Inch Nails, Filter and Radiohead all perfom successful live music tracks utilizing complex sequencing. Is Korn up to the challenge? A final thought regarding the departure of Head. I think that many bands have moved forward creatively after a member has exited. A great example is Faith No More. After guitarist Jim Martin moved on in 1994 FNM went on with other guitarists to create two excellent CD's still worth listening to today.  However the question for me remains. Can Korn pull it off live?
0553260111|4.0|\\"The Bourne Identity\\" begins the Bourne saga a few years after the Vietnam conflict.  Mixed with cunning encounters and wild surprises, it is difficult to envision some ad hoc events occurring within the suspicious undercover sphere.<br /><br />The dialogue between characters nearing a page in length could use more or occasionally any action to convey emotion and interaction.  Whenever action does occur amidst conversation, touching the other persons face seems to be the atypical primary contact.  Expressions comparable to \\"that is what you said\\" remarked too often while quoting each other.  Several diverse characters solve problems using parallel logical processes, an unlikely event.  Also when a character comprehends the French language it would behoove the publisher to translate the text for those not fluent with the words.<br /><br />Other than the Vietnam conflict and John F. Kennedy assassination references, the story could reasonably translate to the modern era.  The rather amazing conclusion holds ones curious as to how the main characters politically continue in subsequent novels.<br /><br />As with about every film-based novel, I would suggest at least not watching the movie prior to reading the book if not forgoing the movies (transpiring near or after the turn of the millennium) thereby leaving the series entirely to the imagination.<br /><br />I recommend this series to any fan of the action spy genre.<br /><br />Thank you.
0345423496|1.0|<br />I want to cut Mr. Clarke some slack. I really do. He's a legend, a genius, one of the greatest and most influential *genuine* (as opposed to fantasy) science fiction writers of all time. But I just can't. \\"3001\\" is soooo bad. <br /> <br />The story takes place in (duh) the year 3001. Frank Poole's corpse, after bobbing around space for a millenium, gets discovered, defrosted, and woken up.  Too bad for Frank, 'cause the world of \\"3001\\" is hokey, derivative, and ever so lame.  For example, the decorative plants of 3001 are tended by intelligent(ish) gorillas and dinosaurs with computers attached to their heads (my question: where are the sharks with friggin' laser beams attached to their heads??). <br /> <br />So much for the hokey and the lame; on to the derivative.  No kidding, a significant portion of \\"3001\\" appears to have been lifted directly from the film \\"Independence Day.\\" In the book's epilogue, Clarke himself vehemently denies ever seeing or knowing anything about \\"Independence Day,\\" but I call b------t. Either way, I'm not sure which is worse, a respected author ripping off ideas from one of \\"The Fresh Prince's\\" movies or coming up with those inane, B-movie ideas on his own. <br /> <br />I would recommend you judge the alleged similarities/plagarisms for yourself, but then you'd actually have to read \\"3001,\\" and that is one thing I definitely recommend you NOT do.  Instead, I suggest you just pretend \\"3001\\" had never been written and seek out a different source of speculation as to what life will be like in the Third Millenium, like watching Matt Groening's \\"Futurama.\\" It's way more entertaining and probably just as plausible.
B0007GAERG|4.0|Mariah Carey is a talent.  You can hate her, hate her music and everything about her but you can not deny that she has made a huge mark on the music industry. She has so much commercial success under her belt that it's almost unbelievable.  160 million albums sold worldwide since her 1990 debut with a whopping 17 number one singles and countless other top 20 hits. she is beaten only by the Batles for more number 1 singles and is the biggest selling female artist in music history.  These are the facts. <br />  She is also a artist that you either love to death or want to put to death.  So it makes it hard to know what to believe when it comes to \\"Emancipation of Mi Mi\\" So I am here my friends to tell you the truth about MiMi. <br />   Mariah's 12 album release \\"The Emancipation Of Mi MI\\" is a solid effort from Ms. Carey.  Filled with truly catchy songs and very rich ballads.  Already she has had huge success with this album (5 million albums sold so far) with 2 number one singles) and it seems as Mariah will continue to be emancipated for some time.  With her current 8 grammy nominations (and possible wins) fueling album sales. <br />  Many tracks are suprisingly easy to listen to like the simple yet powerful \\"We belong together\\" and the show-stopping \\"I wish you knew\\" and the gospel inspired \\"Fly like a bird\\" while other tracks like \\"Get your number\\", \\"Say something\\" and \\"It's like that\\" will have you wanting to run to the club and get your freak on. <br />   Most of the tracks are well written and feature the trademarked \\"So So Def\\" sound thanks to the many collaborations with Jermaine Dupri and there are many guest stars on the album like Snoop dogg, Twista and Nelly that adds to the fun of Emancipation. <br />   There is however a darker side. Many of the tracks lean heavily to the street sound and the current \\"Crunk\\" phenomenon that dominates the airwaves these days and shies away from what Mariah is really good at..belting out powerful balleds. <br />   Don't get me wrong, there are ballads... good ones for that matter.  And Mariah is very good at keeping up with the current sound and trends in urban music.  But sometimes some of the songs can sound a little too much like what's being cranked out currently on the radio and not enough of like her trademark style. <br />   For that matter some of her vocals fall flat on emancipation. Case in piont the overly-creamy ballad \\"Joyride\\" and the sometimes screechy \\"Mine again\\"  Both good songs but are almost tarnished by the vocals. <br />   Granted, Mariah is older and her voice has become more husky & wispery in recent years (this can happen as we age) she still can hit her trademark high notes and her power notes.  What seems to be lacking is some of the control that she displayed in earlier albums. (check out her vocals on \\"Vanishing\\" from her album Mariah Carey, If it's over\\" from Emotions and the amazing control she has on \\"Lead the way\\" from the ill-fated Glitter soundtrack)this problem is evident in some of the yelpie and sqeakie notes that you will find on portions of Emancipation. <br />   Dispite it's flaws The Emancipation of Mi MI is a return of sorts for Mariah and it does not dsappoint. It is strong, confident and a very fun album to listen to.  A must have for Mariah fans and is Defiantly worth buying.
B000002LFU|4.0|Very good, although not the best REM. Murmur is perhaps the purist work of musical art.  \\"Fables of the Reconstruction\\" and  <br />\\"Deadletter Office\\" are close seconds.    <br /> <br />This CD is worth buying, especially if you are a big fan.  Thanks to my friend Catherine for getting this CD for me for Christmas.
B000BNI90O|5.0|I've been waiting so long for something like this to come. The best part about the album is that it has the song from \\"The Passing of the Elves\\" scene. I heard it on the extended version and wished that they had put it on the soundtrack. I love that it is more extended then the original soundtrack. Howard Shore is great and I hope that the next two extended soundtracks will come out soon.
B00006JDSI|3.0|The score sucks.  It's really bad.  Sometimes it works wonderfully, but then it gets muddy at spots or doesn't really fit the scene, sometiems it's just plain rediculous. <br /> <br />That's my only qualm with this though.  The movie is wonderful and it's pleasure to watch on mute.
B0001AVZA8|4.0|I was surprised that this was rated PG-13. When you see some mommy-bags, normally that indicates an R rating. But then again, it was pretty brief. So I guess it would count more as a flashing. Basically, we got flashed by Diane Keaton. The only thing that would have made that scene better would be if she had been wearing a trenchcoat. <br /> <br />Getting serious now, the movie was not bad. Although it seemed pretty obvious to me that it was written by a woman. Yes, women DO get the shaft when it comes to age. When a guy gets older, people usually consider him to be more distinguished-looking. When it happens to a woman, its botox time. This is definitely a double-standard in our society, but it's just that guys really don't spend a heck of a lot of time worrying about it. <br /> <br />Another good indication that it was written by a woman was the whole thing about a woman getting revenge on her ex-boyfriend by writing a play that totally trashes him. I know it is just a movie, but I would say that that is a pretty crappy thing to do to ANYBODY - womanizer or not. <br /> <br />And the final indicator was the whole thing about the young, rich, single doctor chasing the upper-middle aged woman. How many times does that happen in real life? Pretty seldom, which puts this safely in the realm of female fantasy rather than romantic comedy. <br /> <br />The fact that it was obviously written by a woman is not in itself necessarily a problem. The problem is that the female writer has turned this movie into her own personal fantasy, which is something that I as a guy am not all that interested in. <br /> <br />Don't get me wrong. As a guy, I can appreciate a good romantic comedy every now and then. A \\"Chick Flick\\", so to speak. But I don't like it when romantic movies so obviously play towards only a certain sexes' point of view. That makes the movie more of a female romantic fantasy than anything else. There's nothing wrong with that for people who like to watch that sort of thing. But that pretty much puts the movie in the \\"Romantic Comedy Made By Women for Women\\" category. <br /> <br /> <br />All that philosophizing aside, the movie had some pretty good moments. My favorite was the scenes with the email exchanges, with little subtle flirts going back and forth. Yeah, it was kind of corny, but I thought it was pretty realistic as far as how normal people interact. And the realistic things are what make a movie funny and good sometimes. <br /> <br />One of the best moments was when Jack's character started to type, \\"I Miss Y-\\" and then couldn't go on. That part was really well-written. <br /> <br />Probably the worst casting in this movie was Keanu Reeves. I mean, I love the guy in \\"The Matrix\\". I even like him in \\"Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure.\\" But in this movie, the chemistry just was not there. I kept trying to see him with Diane Keaton and no matter how I looked at it, it just did not fit. Keanu's acting wasn't bad or anything. And it's not just the age problem. It just did not work. Maybe it's because Keanu Reeves still looks like a 20-year-old in my mind, and that is just TOO young. I think somebody else would have made a much better pick to play the young doctor, though I don't know who. <br /> <br /> <br />There is one thing though that irks me about this movie more than anything else, and Hollywood is notorious for it. What is Hollywood's fetish with always showing divorced people still hanging out together as \\"just friends.\\" HELLO? That is about the most unrealistic thing I know.  <br /> <br />Here is THE REAL WORLD: When people get divorced, 99.9% of the time the husband and wife can't stand each other and don't want to see each other ever again. If they are coworkers, one of them quits and goes to a new job just to get away from that sorry SOB. They DO NOT invite each other to each other's house \\"just to hang.\\" They DO NOT continue working closely with each other. And most importantly, they DO NOT go on dinner dateswith each other! <br /> <br />I just honestly do not understand this thing that Hollywood has with just showing people sleep together, move in together, have a kid, get married, then get divorced, then still stay good \\"Friends.\\" What the heck? That NEVER works in real life. <br /> <br />Maybe they show it that way because of the high divorce rate in Hollywood; people get married and divorced there all the time. It's no big deal there - kind of like ordering your meal. If you didn't like what you got, you just send it back and get something else. It's not that way in the rest of America, and I get pretty sick and tired of having that twisted morality shoved down my throat. <br /> <br />Aside from that particular soapbox rant, I'd say that it is a decent movie. Not one I'd probably want to see again, but a Chick Flick worth renting at least. And I'm talking to you guys who have made your wives sit through too many Stallone movies with you. You need to give something back every now and then, fellas!
B000AU9UYM|1.0|Radom thoughts:<br /><br />1. While liking the general concept of Batman, I don't like the Dark Knight persona.<br /><br />2. This movie seems to be a prequeal for all the earlier films. It tells the gripping story of Bruce Wayne in a unuiqe and emotional way.<br /><br />3. Great actors, great props, great music, great special effects.<br /><br />4 The plot line is scary though, espeacially Dr. Crane's mask.<br /><br />5. A few suprises in this one: Wayne Manor burning down and Bruce's suppossed \\"mentor\\" turning out to be a bad guy.<br /><br />6. The only thing that saves this movie are the actors and the DVD's special features. I guess I'll have to investigate the Dark Knight persona a little more to appriciate it. I'd consider seeing another Batman movie as long as Christian Bale keeps the lead role.
B000000WJK|3.0|i have to agree with the few negative comments about the production of this record. <br />i have not listend to all of this album fully yet, but it seems in most songs the voice has been drained out, and cant be heard very well.. richard ascroft has such a good voice, it was a crime that they hid it .. <br />still a good album..but would be heeps better if they moved the voice forward.. <br />
B000B8QEYC|5.0|I've loved Enya from day one, have all her albums, & was most pleased when I heard this one.  While 'Day without Rain' was a nice album, it wasnt full Enya quality to me - this is.  I I continue to introduce those around me to the beautiful, relaxing, peaceful, & strengthening music of Enya. <br />
B0000CDJPQ|5.0|After reading the pair of \\"doesn't work\\" reviews from the same person, I decided to try it anyway, figuring that Amazon would do an easy refund if it really didn't work (also, I've had good experiences with other Sonnet products in the past).<br /><br />It works just fine for me. I've used it to connect an iPod and an iSight to the Firewire800 port on my Powerbook, both work fine. It seems a decent value and I'm happy with it.
B000BTC5LW|5.0|The Canadian site has June 6, 2006 as a release date.<br /><br />So the dates are all over the place.
B0001GL3K4|5.0|This movie is awesome. I have watched it several times and purchased it as well. The cast is brilliant. Liam Neison, Hugh Grant, Alan Rickman and Bill Nighy ( Billy Mack ) were just amazing to watch!! I loved the music and shame on everyone else who has to say it is not worth the watch!! If you have a soul, a good one, a big heart and are open minded then watch this. If you are a tired, bitter old soul who cannot see the joy and fun in a simple movie than just go rent or buy something else.
0393312836|5.0|A Clockwork Orange Book Review <br /> <br />The book A Clockwork Orange written by Anthony Burgess is one that never has a dull moment. The book is full of action; something is always going on whether it is a rape, a beating, or even burning down some ones home. Its so action packed that it's really hard to put this novel down. The four main characters in the novel are Alex, Pete, Georgie, and Dim. Alex is what I like to call the leader of this violent gang like group of boys. These four go around committing violent acts and think it is completely alright. They figured since they never got caught they could keep beating people up. Alex was in for a rude awakening in the middle of the novel when he was captured by the authorities and all of his friends ran off. One of the many unique twists this novel had was when Alex was essential brainwashed and forced to watch these violent acts and then released into the general public. Every time a violent act was committed he became very ill. I really enjoyed the unique twists the author deployed to really make the reader think and in some ways created this sense of disbelief. The writing style was quite different in the beginning, I liked how it made you really pay attention to your reading and actually even made you go back to try to figure out what was just said. The novel was a fairly easy read once you got past the first 30 pages or so. At the same time I also disliked the writing style because of the extreme amount of time that was spent trying to decipher the text in the beginning. I also disliked the fact that they didn't have a glossary at the end to help with the deciphering of some of the words throughout the novel.  I would recommend this novel to anyone who is looking for something that is full of jam packed action and is ready for the many twists that are thrown out at you by the author. Its one both teens and adults can enjoy. <br />
B000000OSE|2.0|I completely disagree with the Amazon review which says UYI I is arguably the better of the two UYI albums.  <br /> <br />I bought both the day they came out, but in recent years have only had UYI II. I think, while that album isn't as strong as Appetite, it is pretty darn good.  <br /> <br />Civil War is as good as anything GNR ever did, IMO. Shotgun Blues, Breakdown, Pretty Tied Up, Locomotive, So Fine, Estranged, and You Could Be Mine are all good songs, too. As far as covers, I think Knockin' on Heaven's door was GNR's best cover. I loved it since the Live at the Ritz verison.  <br /> <br />I just checked UYI I out from the library (it was actually uncensored). I've tried listening to it three times now, and I end up skipping through the whole thing. Lots of weak songs. I was never a huge fan of November Rain or Don't Cry, and I don't think they've aged well. They just aren't dirty rock and roll, like GNR should be. Right Next Door To Hell, Perfect Crime, Bad Obsession and Bad Apples all seem like filler to me. Also, Coma is OK, but Estranged and Civil War from UYI II are much better epics.  <br />
0793538491|5.0|A night at the Opera is one of the boldest mile stones in the history of music, and the best in the last century. Bohemian Rhapsody is a true classic, by it's foundation and revolutionary structure. The song's biggest \\"thing\\" is that everybody remembers the first time that they hear it and this makes it one of a kind. <br />A night at the Opera is the ABC of modern operatic rock!
B000BMSTMS|5.0|This is for all the people who wrote about KoRn suckin as they supposedly always have......... Get F@#& over yourselves, if you did not like them in the first place WTF did you write a review of their album for?  If you can not be constructive in your criticisms do not write them, we all know you do not have anything better to do but dont vent on a public site and subject us to your idiocy.  Now that thats done, people KoRn does not have a standard sound their albums reflect that, as for the meaning of the songs and whether or not it is angsty and whether or not that is a good thing now a days thats mute.  It is called personal preference, if you want to hear lyrics without meaning go find some rage band or some Sh*% that has no meaning and stop hating on people that do not need or care for your stupidity.  All in all this album has true style with the haunting lyrics andd deserves some respect for what it is, a transistional album, they lost a creative member of their band so give it time and give them some slack or go out and do better rather than waste peoples times with your meaningless and rather hurtful rants.
B00097DXZS|4.0|*Well first I want to take a second to tell all of you who are mad about what the cd All That I Am did to your computer to calm down. You do realize that anything put on a cd other tehn the music is done by the record companys right? Of course not because you people would rather sit and write awfull things about Carlos and his music and this cd and say its band and he is overrated and say the cd is bad which it isnt, an act like this is all his fault when it most certainly is not. Well no one told to put the cd in your computer did they? No I didnt think so, so I behalf of all the morons I want to apoligize Mr. Carlos Santana*<br /><br />Now on to the album. All That I Am by Santana is the third album of duets the band has released in the last 8 years. While I do enjoy these cds I wish that he would release an album of just Santana, or Carlos Santana since it isnt really a band anymore, just him and studio musicians. But here the guitar playing by Carlos is just as pleasing as ever so I dont know why people feel the need to complain about that. The man is playing jsut a good as he was 35 years a go just not the same style of music, yes this is more pop then usual but its Carlos Santana if he wants to release a country album he can and we'll buy it and love it and it will be the best country album you ever heard.<br /><br />'Im Feeling You' with the Branch girl is a nice catchy song, not as good as on the last album Shaman but its nice. 'My Man' With Mary J. Blidge and Big Boi is alright not to special but a good song. 'I Dont Wanna Lose Your Love' with Los Lonley Boys is a nice song, one that sounds like something he might have recorded in the late 1970's. 'Trinity' with Robert Randonlph and Metal God Kirk Hammer and shows why Carlos and Kirk are guitar gods and why Robert will be one here in the near futre. 'Twizted' is and alright songs but not really one of my favorites but I can see that most everyone else who owns the album loves it and thinks its the best song on the album.<br /><br />But for me the real magic of this album is one track number five. Steven Tyler, the greatest frontman frim the worlds best rock band and owner of the greatest voice in history steps in to write and sing with Mr. Santana. How amazing, one of the things I always thought would be cool came true! 'Just Feel Better' contains some of the best vocals Steven Tyler has recorded in the last 15 years! Carlos' playing is full of passion here and the whole song just kicks major butt! I was thinking of not buying this album because I didnt really enjoy Shamann, but then I heard Steven Tyler was going to be on it so I bought it, and I would say the album is worth the money just for this song alone!<br /><br />So in conclusion this is a great album. No it's not Santana's best, but it is still a great album and there is nothing wrong with it. What people have to realize is artists change styles and he isnt going to make another Abraxes, or another Santana I, or Supernatural so enjoy the music and hope you like the next album better!song on the album.  <br /> <br />But for me the real magic of this album is one track number five.

B000065V41|3.0|I have tried accessing the song by changing my viewing to fullscreen. but the copy i seem to have got for christmas does  not allow u to change to full screen. there is no option for this in set up. So I really cannot watch \\"the love has gone\\" which is my favourite song and the best part of the film. I have watched the film every christmas on video with my family since i was bought the video as a very young child. I am very upset to find my favourite part of the film has just vanished!!! I am unable to access it thru set up... so now when watching the dvd im going to have to switch to my video to watch the song and then carry on with the dvd. I am sure that there are other changes too. the whole feel of it just felt \\"different\\". <br />I am dissapointed.
B000BBOUU4|2.0|As stated many times I agree that Johnny Depp is such a versitile actor but for the following reasons this movie was spoiled.And being a remake I am sorry I cannot avoid occational<br /><br />comparasins to the original:<br /><br />1:) The visualizations and camera work is joyless and souless.<br /><br />Instead of drawing on the quirky humor and wackiness of his first film 'Pee Wee's Big Adventure' he drew on his later,darker<br /><br />works-notably 'Edward Scissorhands' and 'Batman'.While those were both great films in their own right this is not 'that' kind of movie.<br /><br />2:)I DID'NT WANT TO DELVE INTO WILLIE WONKA'S TROUBLED BOYHOOD!!!!!!!!!!!!<br /><br />3:)The golden ticket winners were bland compared to the flamboyantly obnoxious originals and the lack of dialog made took even more soul out of it.<br /><br />4:)WARNING:CHEAP OOMPA LOOMPAS!Instead of hiring a new cast Burton relied to computer multiplied images of actor Deep Roy to<br /><br />generate an endless series of quintuplets.<br /><br />5:)This remake had no sense of humor at all.The jokes are ironic and never funny,even one mildly ammusing remark about breakfast cereal.<br /><br />6:)As hinted at earlier this film borrows far too much from Burton's other films.Instead of trying to create a newness to the overall production the entire film seems like............<br /><br />well a production.Very labored and it shows.<br /><br />  While the FX in this is far more high tech and modern then the 1971 original the magic,warmth and humanity is taken right out of it.Just my opinion.
0385338686|5.0|This book was so hard to put down, and I'm sad I've finished it.  I cannot wait for another chapter in this story!  It was the same great writing style of Kinsella with a fresh story line. <br /> <br />Like Becky Bloomwood, Samantha Sweeting gets herself into some sticky situations but this time not with money.  Samantha escapes her mega-stress life as a high profile lawyer in London and accidentally becomes a housekeeper in the country.  Somewhere along the way, she finds her true self and makes you laugh all the way! <br />
B0000TB050|5.0|If you are a U2 fan this is one concert DVD that is absolutely worth buying.  Seeing the band perform for their \\"home\\" crowd in Ireland is really incredible.  The energy of the audience really comes through in the performance of the band.<br /><br />Audio quality is very good as is the video.  The extra features on the disc are great as well.<br /><br />For some reason the song \\"Out Of Control\\" has become one of my favorites on this DVD.  Bono slowly builds the song up and pauses to thank all the band members parents for helping them out financially in the beginning of their careers.  The song keeps building until the roof is blow off (well, it probably would have blown off if they had actually been indoors!)<br /><br />Buy it.  Listen.  Enjoy.  ;-)
B000BM6AVA|5.0|That's pretty much it, anywhere that Mezmerize failed, Hypnotize succeeded. Most of the songs are pretty short, but they hit harder than nearly any other songs I've ever heard. The only song I really don't like is Lonely Day, but it's still alright. The only problem I have with the Mezmerize/Hypnotize production is the new direction SOAD is taking. It's good, no doubt, but I miss the old days when it was just Serj doing his psuedo-rap thing and Daron backing him up with screaming every now and then. Holy Mountains and Vicinity of Obscenity somewhat recapture that, but not entirely. This is a top notch album, I just hope that sometime in the future SOAD will do another album that goes back to their Toxicity days.
B000301YY8|5.0|Jedan od najboljih debitanstskih albuma i pojava na muzickoj sceni u 2005. Blunt je uspeo sa svojim prvim albumom da utre sebi put ka potencijalnoj najvecoj pop zvezdi danasnjice. Apsolutno ceo album Back To Bedlam je hit, bez i jednog jedinog promasaja. Od pocetka albuma koji otvara pesma High, pa do samog kraja Blunt nam nudi samu iskrenost koje mogu da se gade samo takozvani moderni i kul ljudi. <br />Ovo je album za uzivanje. <br />Jos jedan dokaz da najveci dolaze iz Evrope. <br />Back To Bedlam je medju mojih dvadeset u 2005.
B000B0QOJA|5.0|One Down, One Up: Live At The Half Note is a live recording of John Coltrane from two 1965 radio broadcasts.  Unlike today, when an artist appears on-air, the recording is tightly set.  On the first disk, the radio broadcast starts about thirty-five minutes into the middle of the title track and fades out about ten minutes into \\"Afro Blue\\".  While one would love to have the complete set, the music contained is still brilliant.  The sets were recorded with his greatest band lineup, McCoy Tyner on piano, Jimmy Garrison on bass and Elvin Jones on drums.  The band pushed the musical envelope of improvisation that is greatly shown on the title track where Mr. Coltrane plays an unreal twenty-seven minute solo.  The backing group would soon break away after these recordings, but this album is an abbreviated, but a great example of the mastery of John Coltrane.
B000002KHH|5.0|Dark as can be and no light can save this.As this is Black Sabbath's first real big album,and one of their darkest.Eight tracks in all,but each song is its own masterpiece.\\"War Pigs\\" deffinetly sounds like it helped Pink Floyd's opening riff in \\"In The Flesh\\"...And \\"Iron Man\\" is possibly one of the most talked about rock songs to date.Simple as can be but so original even to nows standards,(Wich really isn't that much anymore)and who can forget the other monsterous hit \\"Paranoid\\"?Many metal maniacs today can claim this album to of been the biggest step and probably the first in metal.Led Zeppelin was considered metal,but honestly they weren't the sinners they were cracked up to be.This is the darker side of metal not upbeat like Zep.\\"Rat Salad\\" is sludgy and guitar riffing awsome.\\"Fairies Don't Wear Boots\\" is another Ozzy classic and you can truley get an idea where Sabbath was heading through all these hits.<br /><br />Paranoid is a staple in anyones collection.A must have.
B000002U9E|5.0|I first purchased this album when it was initially released in 1983. It had, at the time the most significant impact on my life, artistically. Twenty two years later I can listen to it as though it were just written with fresh power, passion, conviction and of course innovation. Often when we look back on music that affected our lives we might feel a twinge of embarrasment. In retrospect it just might not hold up, might not have been as thought provoking or musically cutting edge as we used to think. I now know that \\"Hounds of Love\\" is a Classic because whenever I revisit it at chance times in my life it is though I am hearing it again for the first time.
B000957O7S|5.0|I am a sucker for romantic movies but rarely get to watch them because my husband can't stand them.  But I slipped this one through on Will Smith's merits and it was a joy to watch.<br /><br />Our 'hero' helps poor unfortunates who just can't get a date or a girl -he tells them what to say, even to the point of putting earpieces in and telling them what to say from a distance.  He's a real professional, his methods are a great success but of course he doesn't have a girl.  When he finally sets his heart on someone, he takes her on the most amazing day out in New York, it had me swooning \\"oh I wish for that kind of romance\\" (I really am pathetic!).  It's a complete disaster, especially when she finds out his profession, but leads on to a very satisfying conclusion.<br /><br />I loved this movie and highly recommend it!
B000BEZQ0Y|5.0|I simply adored the film and the soundtrack fits the film perfectly. I am finding myself listening to it over and over.  You can just visualize the best scenes...especially \\"Your Hands are Cold\\".  You can feel and see Darcy emerging from the morning mist and walking towards Lizzie where he proceeds to pour his heart out to her.  It is the most romantic music to the most romantic scene in a film in many years.  The emotion is palpable! Buy this CD and see the movie again.  Just simply the best!
B00000IL1K|5.0|I first heard this woman's ineffably wondrous and varied vocal expertise on \\"The Phantom of the Opera\\" written by ex-husband Andrew Lloyd Webber for her.  As singular as that musical experience was, it is in \\"Eden\\" that I believe she attains an aesthetic zenith.  Listening to this epic while at work over a period of several months, songs from the album have inflitrated my auditory spirit. The feeling is so delightfully ephemeral that one remembers almost with nostalgia past musical ecstasies encountered.  And this feeling grows, for me, until certain sectional climaxes are almost unbearable, such as the orchestral crescendo of \\"Il Mio Cuore Va\\". <br />I concur with the reviewer below who astutely observes that \\"Very few albums like \\"Eden\\" are made -- it draws its listeners in through intrigue and beauty rather than any obvious ploys for attention. It's hard to imagine just how it could be better than it is -- a few tweaks here and there, but no song feels out of place or superfluous. Whether she's reworking covers or dipping into Puccini, the music sounds flawless and uniform.\\" Sarah Brightman's melodious utterances provide holy communion with utter beauty. <br />
B0000CEB4V|5.0|A year after his death the family and friends of George Harrison had \\"A Concert for George\\" at Royal Albert Hall.  Eric Clapton served as the musical director for the evening and the more you know about the life and music of George Harrison the less surprised you will be by who showed up.  Of course Paul McCartney and Ringo Starr were there, along with Billy Preston, Ravi Shankar and his daughter Anoushka, Jeff Lynne and Tom Petty.  There was also Joe Brown, Gary Brooker, and George's son Dhani Harrison.  Most of Monty Python showed up as well (with Tom Hanks joining their number), which makes sense when you remember that Harrison not only was a producer on \\"Monty Python and the Holy Grail\\" but also played a part during the Sermon on the Mount scene.  Throwing \\"I'm a Lumberjack\\" into the middle of the proceedings since as good a way as any of bridging the gulf from the eastern music portion of the evening and all of those assembled taking turns singing almost all of Harrison's best songs (changing the giant black & white photograph of Harrison for the two halves of the evening was a nice touch as well).<br /><br />For me it is impossible to watch this concert and not remember going to see \\"The Concert for Bangladesh\\" and thinking of these two concert films as bookends of a sort for Harrison's career.  The relief effort for Bangladesh was really the point when Harrison transcended being a Beatle, which is obviously a hard thing to do.  In this double-DVD gives you a choice between the complete two-and-a-half hour concert and the feature fill that edited the concert down and mixed it with interviews and rehearsal footage.  My preference is for the complete concert, which obviously has more songs (e.g., \\"That's the Way It Goes,\\" \\"I Need You,\\" and \\"Wah Wah\\") but listening to these artists share their memories and feelings for George is worth watching from time to time as well.  \\"A Concert for George\\" is clearly not just another concert of musical all-stars.<br /><br />My favorite moment from the concert has to be when McCartney pulls out a ukelel to sing \\"Something,\\" which is so charming in its simplicity that it seems a shame when the rest of the band joins in on the song.  Lynne sounds the most like Harrison in singing George's songs, most notably on \\"Give Me Love (Give Me Peace on Earth\\"), and Clapton's best moment singing is \\"Beware of Darkness.\\"  Of course his best guitar work shows up on \\"While My Guitar Gently Weeps,\\" which has always been a favorite Harrison composition (the only song that I missed not hearing was \\"Don't Bother Me,\\" which certainly runs counter to most of his music but was the first song he had on a Beatles album).  Joe Brown's \\"Here Comes the Sun\\" is pretty good and so is Billy Preston's \\"My Sweet Lord.\\"  Ringo reminds us that George wrote \\"Photograph\\" for him and that the lyrics obviously have a new meaning.  The choice of Clapton leading the band doing \\"Wah Wah\\" and Brown singing the old song \\"I\\"ll See You in My Dreams\\" makes for an interesting conclusion to the evening.br />My favorite moment from the concert has to be when McCartney pulls out a ukelel to sing \\"Something,\\" which is so charming in its simplicity that it seems a shame when the rest of the band joins in on the song.

B000301YY8|5.0|I discovered James Blunt by his popular radio hit \\"You're beautiful\\".<br /><br />I can't stop playing this album! You find yourself being wooed by the lyrics (ALL HIS), his voice and sound. I can't say any more about \\"Goodbye my Lover\\" and \\"You're Beautiful\\" than what's already been said -- both songs will speak to anyone, but the rest of the album is amazing! This cd can be played in its entirety (and still you will press Replay!); such a rare gift these days. The only regret I have is that it doesn't have more songs. I would have loved a couple more, so I am anxiously waiting for his next cd.
B000AGTPUK|3.0|I must confess that I found this movie somewhat amusing.  Although there is not, on the surface of the movie, a plot, there are incredible graphics throughout the movie.  (It is true, as many will be wont to point out, that there are far better graphics in many other movies, both animinated and not, but that is besides the point).  The central theme of the movie, which is aimed towards children, is that if you have \\"faith\\" in something, you can hear and see things with which non-believers will not notice.  This is largely true:  notice the crying spells in our nation's (the United States') churches:  certainly non-believers could not relate or understand the crying spells.  The believers do -- and that is what differentiates the two.  The believers believe, and thus, see, things that others do not have.  I say this as an agnostic non-believer:  but I do not doubt that the believers actually feel something and see something that others do not see.
B00004Z459|4.0|Linkin Park has a very interesting sound to them. they are a little mixed in Rap and Scratched tunes...It works sometimes and doesn't on others...Although, you might have heard them already..you should still consider purchasing this album on the grounds that it is different and there are better tracks than the singles you've heard >i.e. in the end and crawling< so if you don't buy it, i think it is still worth one playthrough.
