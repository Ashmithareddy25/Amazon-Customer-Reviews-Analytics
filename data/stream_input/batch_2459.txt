B006M7JCC2|5.0|I am trying to become more spiritual.  However, I was unable to identify with the straight forward &#34;Spiritual&#34; books recommended to me.  Then I heard about this book, I'm not sure where I first heard about it.  I sent for it and was able to get into it from the first paragraph.  It had all the information I needed, however, because it was a true story and written in narrative form I was able to read it easily and absorb the information.  I finally understood &#34;Spiritual&#34;.

B004XJRQUQ|5.0|This story is an extreme example of the 1% vs. the 99%.  I really like the story and the message.  Poor Prim, she had so much potential!
B00B97SNJI|3.0|To be honest, this is a fine album with some great songs. As usual the lyrics are great. So why rate it okay instead of outstanding or excellent ? Because my expectations were high after the release of North Hills and Nothing is wrong, the first two albums of Dawes which I rated with four stars. The reason I appreciate this album a little bit lesser is that in my opinion the songs are really good but it lacks of one or two really outstanding songs such as My way back home, a Little bit of everything (Nothing is wrong) or God rest my soul (North Hills).
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|I read a lot, but I can't recall having this much fun while reading a book.  This was great from start to finish and I enjoyed every minute of it.
193700788X|5.0|My daughters and I are true fans of Ms Harris, we own the whole of the series and we have read and enjoyed her other series too. I am very happy with how it turned out.  I am glad Sookie chose to live and be happy.  Drama may be fun to date but is a bitch to live with.  I have always enjoyed the books much more than the tv show, and I feel Ms Harris is toally entitled to decide how to end her books and the course that her character's lives take.
0060853972|5.0|Terry Pratchett is just about my favorite author.  I'm not familiar with Neil Gaiman.  They make a wonderful team.  Terry is a brilliant satirist and his characters invariably involve other realities and species.  Yes it is another book about the struggle between good and evil yet in this version you get to poke fun at all of it.  Full of surprising twists, in typical Pratchett form, he will keep you reading way past your bedtime.
B004ZNA5JO|5.0|...should be the name of some of the reviews on here!<br /><br />If Pink Floyd was as whiny about Waters leaving as some of you people, they never would have continued making albums after he left in the first place! But, I hate to break it to you, Waters was not the whole band and talent. He wrote really great lyrics. He was really a poetic genius. I get that. Giving credit where it is due. But last time I checked, he doesn't wail on the guitar like Gilmour. Doesn't have those whimsical piano touches and even lyrics like Wright. Does he play drums? No?<br /><br />Huh. Guess Waters wasn't the whole band then.<br /><br />So seriously. This whole mess of \\"Pink Floyd without Waters is a joke!\\" is crap and probably founded only on the fact that you are completely enamored with the period AFTER \\"Obscured by Clouds\\" where his dark lyrical influence is completely evident in \\"DSOTM\\", \\"The Wall,\\" and the like until they got tired of him being angry and sad all the time.<br /><br />Anyway, now that I've gotten that out of my system, let me move onto the actual album.<br /><br />AMLOR was truly one of those albums that I believe shocked a lot of people, especially following the heels of the dramatic departure of Waters. Many people could not *fathom* that Pink Floyd would continue, and if they did, would they be any good? This proved that the group was indeed strong enough and talented enough to do it without Waters. This album is, in a word, excellent. Gilmour had always written lyrics in some fashion in past albums, either in contributing or writing whole songs, but this was really a test for him post-Waters, and honestly, he passed.<br /><br />Granted, he is not as poetic as Waters in his writing, but his lyrics are still thoughtful and thought-provoking. Coupled with his masterful guitar playing and the other guys doing their thing, they create masterpieces. \\"Learning to Fly\\" is a great example of this, and is regarded by many as one of the greatest rock songs of all time. The entire album is awesome, but my favorites were \\"Sorrow,\\" \\"On the Turning Away,\\" \\"Terminal Frost,\\" and \\"Dogs of War.\\" Some people don't enjoy \\"DoW,\\" but I don't understand why. To me, its sound is somewhat reminiscent of \\"The Wall,\\" but some people feel that it's an aggressive song for Pink Floyd. In any case, I enjoy it.<br /><br />I also enjoy Gilmour's singing. His voice is soothing, and he can sing surprisingly high for his appearance. Honestly, I've heard him sing some of the songs that Waters originally sang, and I prefer Gilmour's version better. Not all, but enough where I feel that Pink Floyd isn't \\"crashing and burning\\" like some people feel. As far as overall cohesion and feel, I listened to \\"Meddle,\\" \\"DSOTM,\\" \\"Animals,\\" \\"The Wall,\\" and THEN \\"AMLOR\\"...they all seemed like the same band to me. Very pleased and happy with the sound. Still love them. Still respect them.<br /><br />I still like Waters, too. He just lost his marbles a little. And who doesn't lose their marbles a little every once in a while?<br /><br />In any case, if you are a fan of ALL of Pink Floyd...and I'm talking pre-DSOTM and post-Waters, you will not be disappointed in this album. It's a breath of fresh air from the doom and gloom and daddy issues Waters was having. Pink Floyd didn't die because Waters left. So cheer up and love this album. You'll be glad you did.The entire album is awesome, but my favorites were \\"Sorrow,\\" \\"On the Turning Away,\\" \\"Terminal Frost,\\" and \\"Dogs of War.\\" Some people don't enjoy \\"DoW,\\" but I don't understand why.

193700788X|4.0|There is no spoiler here. I just want to say that this was not the best book in the series. It does seem that Ms Harris had grown tired of writing Sookie and tried to wrap things up as quickly as possible. No ending would have pleased everyone. I personally foresaw the ending and found it acceptable.

B007KCG7MQ|5.0|Ever since I heard him with the James Gang, I was hooked.  Joe is different...but that's what makes him simply great.  This is his most compelling album of his career.  The opener speaks to many of us...analog man.  Oh how I remember the 70's...great rock music, stereo sound that turned in to quadrophonic sound.  Big components, reel-to-reel tape decks, anthems, a musical explosion.  Joe was an integral part of it...with his The Smoker You Drink The Player You Feel, So What, etc.  He joined the Eagles in the mid-70's, bringing his edge to them.  Fast forward to now...and he's sober, again writing his own material, doing it his way.  I'm Just Lucky That Way...one of my favorite tracks on this album.  Love the line, \\"if you look like you know what you're doing, people think you do\\"...just classic.  Without a doubt, \\"Family\\" is the biggest treasure on the album.  It's a simple, yet beautiful song...admitting he's been alone for most of his life, and now to experience a loving wife and family, well, it just doesn't get any better than that.  I'm so happy for him and he's paying us all back by writing and singing original material again.  We're the lucky ones.  I absolutely love this album...but am eagerly anticipating his next one.  He says he's got a lot more to say.  BTW, if you didn't catch him on \\"Live at Daryl's (Hall) House\\", be sure to give it a look.  You can tell how much respect each artist has for each other, and when you combine their outstanding musical talents, it's simply awesome.  He said he'd like to do an album with Daryl...and that's something I really hope happens.  Here's the link to that show:<br /><br />[...]

B009NY43NY|5.0|But sometimes, you get what you need.<br /><br />(Now With 100% Less Spoilers!)<br /><br />TLDNR Version: Yes, it's like any other 'Southern Vampire Mystery Series' book you've read, except this is the final one. I enjoyed it like I enjoyed all of the other books, and I'm quite content with the way Charlaine Harris ended it.<br /><br />I practically devoured the books after I read the first one. The series isn't 'PBS,' more like, well, \\"HBO.\\" It's a supernatural soap opera, which is sometimes what we all need after getting tired of our mundane lives. Charlaine Harris gave us all exactly that. Never once did I finish a book and say to myself, \\"I'm tired of this.\\" Even after 'Dead Ever After,' I wanted more. There won't be any more though. And, I'm OK with this.<br /><br />If you read the ending to the last book, I think you'll probably get an idea as to how this one is going to end. Simple as that. No matter what 'team' you may be (and I was always 'Team Quinn'), it's not about what you want, or what the author may want. It's about what the character wants.<br /><br />I honestly didn't see any plot holes, character issues, anything like the super-negative reviews are complaining about. Like I mentioned before, it's like any other book in the series you've read.<br /><br />1. Sookie gets into trouble.<br />2. Sookie has romance issues.<br />3. The mystery is solved, and the book is over.<br /><br />The only difference here is that the book doesn't really lead into more issues. There really is more of a 'and they lived happily ever after' ending here. If you're not OK with this, then find some fan fiction.<br /><br />To Charlaine Harris: Thank you for a wonderful book series, and thank you for encouraging me to read and write more. Ignore the haters, please. I'm eternally grateful you gave us one last glimpse at Sookie's life.<br /><br />The last thing I'll mention, if you're looking for a new series after this one, I highly suggest 'Anita Blake: Vampire Hunter' by Laurell K. Hamilton. It's quite a bit more... graphic/violent than the 'Southern Vampire Mystery Series,' but they too have never failed to disappoint. (Imagine if Sookie could raise the dead and fought vampires toe-to-toe. That's the way I always equate it.)rell K. Hamilton.

B006885FZI|2.0|I and a huge fan of the &#34;Band of Brothers&#34;  I have watched the series front to back a tons of times. I think this was a huge let down as a follow up. I'm not sure what it was, maybe a lack of character building in the beginning of the series. I know that while I was watching it I was kept thinking the new episode will be better and then I just was not.<br /><br />The digital down load from Amazon was spotty at times. it was out of focused on occasion.
B00BBI9WD6|5.0|A wothy successor to 'Basilisk Station'.  David Weber just gets better with time, and Honor Harrington is almost perfectly written as a nearly indistructible ship's captain.  She shows only glimpses of the vulnerqbilities she hides from alm8st evryone.  One of my favorites.
B00COGXGNQ|5.0|Watched it two times in a row, I liked it so much.  The few surprises made it all the better.  Julianne Hough did a great job in her first staring role and I loved the chemistry between she and Josh Duhamel, very believable.  Don't hesitate to rent or buy this one, you will truly enjoy it.

B008645YH6|3.0|I love Marina, don't get me wrong, I think as an artist she is exceptional and creative and brilliant.<br /><br />I ordered Family Jewels on a whim. I loved every song on the album. I felt that Marina expressed herself wonderfully and artfully. I liked this shameless overachiever who admitted to obsessing over purchasing crackers at the market, the woman who artfully critiqued American culture and the subjugation of women.<br /><br />I bought Electra Heart eagerly and awaited the same, or a similar experience. However, aside from \\"Teen Idle\\" I didn't think there were very many gems on this album, and missed Marina's experimental howls and \\"coo-coos.\\" I understand one cannot expect consistency from an artist, that would be dull, but I feel like this album only has glimmers of brilliance that the first just burst with.<br /><br />Despite my complaints, I still stand by my claim that Marina is worth listening to. The album is still great, but Family Jewels is just SO MUCH BETTER. Still, I recommend giving this one a listen.
B00CL0J99K|2.0|This movie was a little disappointing. The other two were fanaminal but the third... ehhh. It was just disappointing the way that they were just trying to put in jokes where they didn't belong. And the twist was horrible.

0307719774|3.0|Description was unclear when I purchased the journal; wasn't sure what I would get.  The paper is high gloss so when writing on it the ink from your pen would probably smear.

193700788X|1.0|The dedication of this book should have been to all those obscure characters in the series.  Because that is what essentially is about.  And of course from the beginning the author pushes us forward with the \\"out of the blue\\" romance between Sookie and Sam.  Like I mentioned before ... Ms. Harris has taken some business tips from J.R. Ward.  This is only half a book!  For almost double the price of a full book; with 75% less customer satisfaction.  I guess she is all about the mighty dollar and she no longer cares about her fan base. Se la vi Ms. Harris for I will never read you again!

193700788X|4.0|Warning...Spoilers...<br /><br />I have to admit, I'd been growing disappointed in the series a few books back, and I couldn't place it on any one thing. I still can't. I didn't like how things played out with Alcide, aside from him being packmaster. I didn't like how Eric had been seemingly \\"tamed\\" by Sookie. I didn't like how the were/shifter women were portrayed as devious or psycho (not all, but enough). I didn't like Sookie's biological clock's incessant ticking, and her whining (yes, whining, which was over the course of several books) about how she was with a vamp, so it wasn't going to happen.<br /><br />So when I finished the last book, Deadlocked, I saw some light at the end of the tunnel. I had friends who were livid. They weren't going to read her books anymore. They thought she was betraying her characters. Blah. Blah. Blah.<br /><br />This book tied up those loose ends much as how Deadlocked tied up, mostly, the Fae storyline and the were storyline. It broke Eric's \\"lovesick\\" appearance, and showed that he hadn't really changed after all. He had thought about changing Sookie, even knowing she didn't want it. He wanted everything that marriage to Freyda offered, and he wanted Sookie, too. It capped the Fellowship of the Sun storyline, which was another loose thread, through Arlene AND Newlin. It also let us know what happened to Johann Strassport after Rhodes.<br /><br />I really liked how she portrayed Sam's reaction after Sookie brought him back, and it segued well into their soon-to-be-relationship (which has actually been brewing beneath the surface since Dead Until Dark, if you've really been reading and not just watching the show, True Blood).<br /><br />I get how people are angry, that it didn't turn out the way they wanted. No offense, but it's not your book, and they are not your characters. Charlaine Harris created the characters, and we've been welcome to watch their lives unfold in Bon Temps. I'm going to miss the series, and I'm glad for the ending. I know many don't agree, but I feel that she stayed true to the characters themselves, as well as to her vision for them.e ending.

My only complaint was that it got a bit slow in the middle while the history of The Section was explained but it finally moved on and got to the meat of the story.

My DoidX and my HTC DNA both came pre installed with Swype and it's really a nice feature. However, SwiftKey runs so smoothly, has an amazing interface (that is customizable) and it's the best - as far as I'm concerned - at guessing /remembering my language. Also it packs a language package that spans the majority of the popular world  languages. It is more than worth the couple bucks, believe me. You'll be lost without it once you try it.
0393343405|1.0|One does not have to have studied Ancient and Medieval History at the graduate school level as I did to know that Prof. Greenblatt's book is not careful and reliable scholarship.<br /><br />Any schoolboy or schoolgirl who has done an in-depth report on the drafting of the American Declaration of Independence knows that Jefferson did not write the phrase: \\"...the pursuit of happiness\\" in his original draft.  Jefferson's words were: \\"...the pursuit of excellence.\\"  \\"Happiness\\" was added in his final draft submitted to committee. Even those historians who might be persuaded it is possible that Jefferson intentionally quoted an obscure Roman poet, understand that the phrase as used in the Declaration did not have an Epicurean meaning nor context.<br /><br />So, if this professor of Renaissance literature cannot be trusted with Early American history, how can he be relied on to interpret events that happened 600 to 2,000 years ago?  With this book, Prof. Greenblatt is predominently out of his field and out of his era; and completely out of his league.

B00AOEA22I|5.0|Supergroup W.E.T. released their sophomore record \\"Rise Up\\" in the winter of 2013. This time around the album has a more band-related feel to it, instead of a Erik Martensson solo album. With more input from Jeff Scott Soto I knew this album could be nothing less than amazing.<br /><br />W.E.T. play a brand of ultra-slick melodic rock made popular in the 1980s. These guys do, however, add a modern flavor to the mix to keep it from becoming stale and uninspired. The songs on the record did take a little time to grow on me to be honest; I was expecting something a little more hard rocking I guess. The songs are all well-crafted and written, and the production job of Martensson is top-notch as is expected. The real highlight for me is the vocals of Jeff Scott Soto. This guy is my absolute favorite hard rock singer, and he does not disappoint on this record for sure. While the majority of the songs are terrific, a couple really caught my eye. I really enjoyed \\"Learn To Live Again,\\" \\"Bad Boy,\\" \\"Broken Wings\\" and \\"The Moment.\\"<br /><br />If you enjoyed W.E.T's debut album at all, you'll enjoy this for sure. I wasn't the biggest fan of their debut, but this is much better to my ears. They just don't make bands like this anymore and that makes W.E.T all the more special.
B009HNDCC4|4.0|Have seen funnier episodes of modern family but it was still funny. The show will never let you down. It is one if the funniest sit coms out there
B007SGLZP8|4.0|Another great book by Grisham.<br />Lots of twists, surprises and excitement.  Will keep you turning the pages to see what happens next!
193700788X|1.0|Who were these characters????<br />Where did all the characters I have been reading about for years go and who are these people that replaced them?<br />I liked that they &#34;tried&#34; to tie up the loose ends, but my goodness these were not the same people I have enjoyed reading about these past  years.<br /><br />I am sad that the book ended the way it did, not because I'm for one team or another, but because if this was truely the path the author wanted to take, I think she should have been leading up to this instead of just springing it on the readers at the very end of the story.<br /><br />IF I ever go back and re-read this series, I will NOT be finishing with this book.  I'll just always wonder what happened to my friends.
B00AS1Q8FW|5.0|Even though Tom Cruise may not meet the physical characteristics, he pulls off a very good Jack Reacher.  Though there have been a few changes from the book I was very satisfied with the whole movie.  I did not expect it to be funny, but it had some great one-liners too!
B0089LOG02|4.0|What a wonderful story...I had no idea that such a thing occurred back then.  The story was great, the ending heartwarming.
B00AYHK7RU|5.0|Bowie never ceases to amaze me, and it seems that his newest albums are even better than some of his early records! I particularly enjoyed &#34;Where are We Now?&#34; and &#34;Dirty Boys.&#34; Fun, thoughtful, provoking, playful - this album is all of that. It hasn't left my CD player for more than a day since I received it!
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|I love this book because if all the drama and all the things that happened in the wonder ful book
B009NY43NY|5.0|I enjoyed this book. I had no problem with Sookie ending up with Sam. He's the guy who's been there for her the whole time. I've always looked at these books as mystery with some romance. I think that for the most part, the characters were true to way they have been written. Everybody knows that Eric's most vested interest is himself. Sookie, at her core, is a small town girl. I think that Sookie just wanted to be accepted for who she was in the town she lived. She got that in this book.
B009NY43NY|5.0|I personally loved this book...yes there were things I wished were different but I enjoyed the way it played out..the ending does irritate me only because it feels like a beginning instead of end but honestly even the ending I enjoyed. I live who she ends up with even though I wasn't expecting it...the writing was good as always and overall I loved it.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Be Aware!! Once you start you can't stop. Therefore make sure you take time out of your schedule once you start.
B001NEK2GE|5.0|I use it to play Guild Wars 2 and it works great!  Perfect for gamers who need lots of keys but do not want to use a keyboard.
B0031RS8AI|5.0|Sophie Kinsella is an extremely talented writer, taking her readers on a journey with the secret dreamworld of a shopaholic, and a very expensive journey at that.<br /><br />Becky Bloomwood is a one of a kind character, one that I though I could only dream about reading of. Her love of shoes, clothes (and luggage) mixed with her sense of humour is a recipe for a whirlwind adventure that only Becky Bloomwood could manage to get herself into.<br /><br />My all time favourite novel that I encourage every label loving lady to read.<br /><br />I am currently reading Shopaholic Abroad and can safely say it does not disappoint.
B00C1BHQXK|3.0|I received this book through one of Amazon's recommendations based on past readings. It came at a good time. i'm 55 very organized and have been feeling that everything was getting disorganized in my life, but due to my necessity of controlling everything and getting everything done I have been compromising in doing more and more things until I reached a point where my to do lists got bigger every day and my done things fewer every day. So even before reading  this book I begun what I thought was procrastination as I have more and more mails I haven't read and more and more work left for next day. I even begun shutting my office door for several hour a day to focus on my one thing's. So my next one thing will be to plan my next one thing but now with a better view of what was beginning to happen in an autodidactic way.
B00BQPEIT2|5.0|I love this game it's very fun. On the next update  put the emerald castle and the China town then it well be perfect.
034580404X|3.0|I purchased this because I was too impatient to wait for my hold on it at the library to come in (I was number 146 in queue to get it). I received it within a week and managed to get through the first two books within a month and a half. I started on the third book, but it just didn't grip my attention enough to finish it. I can definitely say this much though, you can see where this was originally a Twilight fan fiction with some of the edits to the two lead characters. Other than that it was okay.
B00AECGQF2|5.0|I love this Game! !!!!! I have no rude comments or ratings to give Toca Boga They rock and they make THE COOLEST games
B0054SMIH6|5.0|I love this movie! Cool when someone starts out smarmy and turns into a cool guy! I love Matthew McC anyway. But this really a great story!
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|I've always been interested in WWII from both the strategic aspect of the battles themselves as well the courage and spirit of the people who served and were impacted by the war. This book blends both the strategic and the human interest aspect together to create an amazing story.
B00992CF6W|5.0|PLEASE PUT IN BETTER GRAPHICS NEXT UPDATE PLEASE. We want better textures. BETTER TEXTURES NEXT UPDATE AND NEW SKINS INSTEAD OF STEVE
B00CH87HF4|5.0|I love everything about this game, the graphics, the controls, and the game play. The Story in the game is what I like most.
B0091REZMW|5.0|Fun and easy to play.  Don't like how you run out of diamonds so fast.  I agree I want to only pay for the game once, not over and over again.
B000REQT86|3.0|Nosferatu is one of the earliest Dracula films based on Stoker's Dracula. It is an unauthorized film adaptation by German film maker and the characters names have been changed to avoid lawsuit. Recent restored version I saw rechanges the character names corresponding to Stoker novel. But it doesn't matter so much when viewing the film.<br /><br />The reason the film has classical horror film hall of fame status may have come from the presence of Max Schreck as Count Olsok(Dracula in the restored version I saw). Schreck's vampire character is not as gentlemanly as legendary dracula actors such as Bela Lugosi or Christopher Lee. But his every move gives me creeps. In 2001 film \\"the Shadow of Vampire\\" Max Schrek played by Willem Defoe was portrayed as a real vampire acting as an actor. Great vampire actor indeed. The plot which links Bremen's 1838 epidemic and vampire appearance is also a cool idea. The movie was remade in 1978 and forms one of the dracula schools in horror film entertainment world.<br /><br />Verdict: Historial horror film<br />Rating: 68 out of 100<br />Recommended for classic horror film fans.
B009GX7IRA|5.0|I like to follow up on going stories. It is amazing the writers can come up with new images and plots all the time. It is my favorite of all shows.
B00001ODGR|3.0|This isn't a bad attempt at recapuring the famous feel for the famous Paradise Theater album concert I saw in 80/81 you get do see Dennis Deyoung, but the Grand Illusion/ Pieces of Eight is just better listening even with only two original remaining members.<br />After watching it on Palladium channel seveal times it took me back to a time of music I hadn't visited in quite awhile.
B0094K1WZE|4.0|It's hard to go wrong with MI. Great action and Tom Cruise is just a great action actor? I recommend
B007KOYEOC|5.0|really enjoyed the Trilogy. Well written. Couldn't put the last book down. Look forward to more from E. L. James.
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|I have lots of fun playing this game. It is a lot like temple run, but Iron Man 3 is so much moe fun.
B007SOQBCM|1.0|Really the worst app I've gotten so far. It glitches and doesn't let me watch a stream and even after it doesn't let me. Really bad app overall
B00AJAFNIA|5.0|I've really enjoyed this little game.  Picked it up for free, but it would be totally worth buying.  While simple in concept it remains engaging as you advance.
B005KR6OBM|2.0|Season 3 didn't work at all, seller replaced it but the replacement didn't work either. I tried it on 3 different dvd players. Also last cd on season 4 glitches out. Frustrating.
B009LMTDL0|5.0|Worth the read.  I hope both women and men will thoughtfully go through the book and consider the issues.  And after considering the issue, discuss it with the women and men around them.  And after discussing the issue with others, be willing to do the hard work of making the home and workplace better by full participation of all people.  We need diverse voices is all areas of life if we are to be a healthy society.
B007STXHTM|5.0|Took it on a dive to 50 feet, got great photographs and videos.  Crystal clear optics with no distortion.  Gopro2 plus dive housing is the cheapest way I know to get quality underwater photography.
B0063IH60K|3.0|Good fun game . if you like cards this is game for you. I truly love trying to beat my score and make less moves each time. Rebekahjasmine@yahoo.com

1451673442|5.0|I have both The Secret, and The Power.  I love all of Rhonda's books.  They have helped me immensely.  I would recommend her books.
B00CBRADU2|1.0|This film is a poor example of what one would expect from Arnold. I would not recommend this to anyone, there are plenty of older Arnold film that are so much better.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love this game it is awesome and every one should have it so yah bye people and let God be with you
B005J32Y6Q|2.0|Was excited to watch... Put it in my player.. Wouldn't play ... I tried everything and stil won't.. But it's a great movie if u can watch it
B0041EVYVK|4.0|First of all, I'm a professional musician so consider my review to be quite biased.<br /><br />I would describe this CD as a largely successful experiment.<br /><br />The pros: Trixie Whitley's vocals (this was my first at length introduction to her, she is very soulful, great pipes, I'm loving \\"Fourth Corner\\") and Brian Blade's drumming make for dynamic music that really moves. The production is beautiful, which is to be expected coming from Daniel Lanois. It was recorded mostly live but was substantially manipulated in mixing which gives it a vibe which encompasses both contemporary and retro aesthetics, which I like. There are several songs which really hit home.<br /><br />The cons: I think that while the huge talents on this disc work together well they sometimes don't articulate a unified artistic vision. By that I mean that they're not always hearing and working toward the same thing, and because of this the record is a little lacking in emotional poignancy, at least for me. It's a little bit rambling overall. Also, I'm not crazy abut the sound; the mix is great but tonally it sounds a little brittle to me (particularly the drums), which was a surprise.<br /><br />Overall I like the disc and continue to listen to it, and I would recommend it.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|I very much enjoyed this game - it holds the player's interest and is neither too difficult  nor too easy. The guide that comes with the game is handy although I didn't need to use it. This game is worth purchasing!
B004FRX0MY|5.0|Don't mark this app down because your phone is crap.  The size is tiny if you have a modern phone.  It does not waste CPU and doesnt even use much resources when you ARE using it.  The selection is awesome, there are many deals on albums.  Thanks to the convenience of this app and deals on albums, I have eliminated my pirated songs.  Now just need Amazon VOD for Android.  I love Amazon!
B00A9T1HUO|3.0|This rendition was OK.  I just enjoy his earlier CD's much better.  He is trying to develop a more contemporary sound and I prefer the more standard, melodic vocals of his earlier work.  I was really looking forward to that in this CD and was disappointed.
B005UBNKWO|4.0|Breathtaking speeds especially when over clocked.  There however is a delayed start up.  That just means it takes 5-8 seconds to warm up.  Other than that this CPU is top notch.  I would recommend this to anyone with a limited budget and looking for a powerful AMD processor.
B0077SGMXM|5.0|Addictive game! Love it. Increasing difficulty. Practice rounds. Ten year old nephew likes it too. Takes finesse and a little bit of luck.
B003P9VZ0W|1.0|I'm truly disappointed in this product.  In less than an hour, he started peeling and falling down.  The gemstones stick very well, just not the princesses.
B0097EWK3A|5.0|This game was great. I really liked the different puzzles and the depth of the story. I can't wait for the next one.
0812993845|3.0|To be honest, I have mixed feelings about this book. Over the years, I have turned to Kinsella for light, cutesy romance reads that have plenty of humor woven in. As for having the typical Kinsella flair, Wedding Night has it. But there was something off as well. Most Kinsella books, for me, are pretty much one sitting reads. With Wedding Night, there were times that I really struggled. It was not a bad book at all. Just the usually sparkle was missing. If you love reading Sophie Kinsella, then I am sure you will not have many issues. However, for those not too familiar with her books, this one may not be the best to start with.
B00BFUUMO8|1.0|I had been playing this game for a while.  My children and I enjoyed the dinosaurs, sound effects, quests, etc...<br />The game would eventually become glitchy and I would just power cycle my kindle fire, no big deal.<br /><br />But a reset option on a farm style game is ridiculous.  All the time spent on the game is now even more wasted than it was before.  Due to a terrible idea and an energetic 4 year old who went button happy one day, I would have to start at the very beginning after being level 28.<br /><br />I removed this app instead of starting over.
B004U8VWLE|3.0|was expecting much more after hearing about this picture as much as I did....very mediocre I thought in every regard
B00CH87HF4|1.0|this game is very smooth on the kbdle fire first generation, but GAMELOFT forgot some software and made this game on the kindle fire first generation became bad. after i came into the game, i can not exit because the game did not play at the full screen, that is a reason i could not find the icons to exit the game. I can feel some workers in GAMELOFT trying to destroy and hacking GAMELOFT company. in one day GAMELOFT will be lose and will be delete in the future. the Ending of your company is coming. please fixing the all softwares before too late.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|Fun game. This is a game to play to pass time .I like it .I recommend it .it makes you think,
B009UX2YAC|5.0|The game is really good  i have had no problems with it but sometimes all these things about other apps pop up and it does get annoying at times ..... The people are really a challenge  to gte they cost a lot pf money / coins.... Otherwise i have had no problems at all playing this game it is better if you have a facebook sign in lile subway surfers then you can play up againist your facebook friends. :-)
B00CH87HF4|5.0|I have never reviewed a game yet. this game is one of my favorites. its free, great grafics, develop your own character, single or Multi player, and easy to use.
B0035O66BU|5.0|I hadn't seen this movie in years and wanted to introduce my girlfriend to it.  Glad I did, she loved it and of course it was a treat to see it again.  Tatum O'Neal is cute as hell and steals the show with her quick wit, foul mouth while keeping her innocence as a kid.  Ryan did a great job staying in character as a crooked salesman, who learned he could take a few pointers from his much younger sidekick. Very entertaining and a must see!
0060555661|3.0|Great book, very informative about the value investing. Always liked Graham's. glad I finally got around to read it. Quality of the bound is a little disappointing.
B00AB7HESI|5.0|I really like this game it is really cool and for the pepole of minecraft i am sky and yes i have a kindle
0385508417|5.0|I loved this book modern day Srooge.  I laughed on a constant basis and shared it with a lot of my friends

014241722X|3.0|These series are something different for Grisham,  Not bad but I think for younger readers, sorry to say I do not fit in that catergory, too bad..
B008OOYALE|5.0|Dragon Story is the best amazon app I have ever downloaded on my Kindle Fire. I am &quot;SERIOUS&quot; about this app (my presious)
B004SUDPWI|4.0|Great book, classic movie.  Some things  get better with age this one was one of those things.  One of a kind.
0394800184|4.0|glad to have this for yet another generation.  Can't wait to see the new addition to our family to read this to him.
B008I43DYU|5.0|Easier to use than a separate calculator.  I do work on my laptop and keep the Kindle on with this calculator app on , placed in my vertical stand and can just touch the numbers. l  can see the numbers so easily and don't need to hold a calculator or keep switching between Windows calculator and my work
0399226907|4.0|good book I am familiar with this book from years ago.  Glad to have new children in our family again to share this book with them.
B00992CF6W|4.0|Minecraft Pocket Edition is good except their is a few bad things. They need to add Buckets,Redstone,Caves,and Villages but overall pretty good.
0920668372|5.0|This is a timeless book for children of all ages.  Enjoyed by adults and toddlers.  I am glad I was able to get it as our family begins to grow bigger.
B00BEJ5O6Q|4.0|I'm a true Blake Shelton fan but was a little disappointed to hear the language on the album that you don't hear in the radio version. No warning about swearing, no 'explicit lyrics' sticker....I bought 2 copies. One for myself & one for my granddaughter who I am grooming into a country fan. Nice,  wholesome music.....C'mon Blake...\\"I still got a Finger\\"??<br /><br />You didn't need this to get where you are today. Don't insult your fans who came along for the ride & helped you get what you have today.<br /><br />Your voice is great as always...best in the business. Get back to family music please.
B002DCLQOW|5.0|I loved it then and I love it Now too.. so nice to see where the actors of gilmore girls have taken their lives post show
B0086700CM|4.0|Great game for free. It keeps you entertained for hours on hand. I find myself pressing &quot;Run Again&quot; without even thinking about it!  Glad I downloaded it!
B000UZNRS2|5.0|I have thoroughly enjoyed this series and will continue as long as Mr. Baldacci agrees to write them. You never know what's coming!
B008TRUDAS|5.0|As a first time Hoover reader I was thrilled with this novel.  I was drawn into the characters and truly felt their anguish and excitement.  I ranged from spontaneous laughter to tears and just couldn't put it down.  It was a great read and I look forward to Point of Retreat.
B001C4AFOY|5.0|I THINK IT IS VERY ROMANTIC.  I LOVE THE COSTUMES AND SETS.  THE ACTORS HAVE DONE AN EXCELLENT JOB.  THEY WERE VERY CONVINCING AND WHEN I LOOKED UP PICS OF THEM, THEY DID A GREAT JOB OF HAVING THEM LOOK LIKE THE REAL PEOPLE.  THE FILMING IS DONE SO WELL, THE DECOR IS BEAUTIFUL.  I WISH WE STILL WORE CLOTHES IN THAT STYLE.  IT IS MY HUSBAND AND MY FAVORITE PICTURE.  AND IT IS AN EXCELLENT EXAMPLE OF A LOVING MARRIAGE.
B004XQYBA2|5.0|A good game with thousands of individual puzzles of multiple difficulties. Good features, easy to use simple interface.  Only wish there was a clear all button for those times when I completely screw up a puzzle.
B0097EWK3A|5.0|Love this game because I love search and find and mystery about missing people or crazy people who is for the family money that belongs to their son or daughter
B000HL09MG|4.0|Depending on your layer of understanding of how things work in the world, the psychological and sociological implications of this movie, will determine your opinion of it. On the basic level, it is a movie about a man who, with good reason, is insecure in his marriage. His wife's fantasies of being with other men, drives him into the streets to find adventure and sex. He finds more than he bargins for.<br /><br />On another level, this movie is about the rich. It shows that once one reaches a certain financial and business level, one could resort to baser things. Once all other goals are accomplished, what's left but debauchery?<br /><br />On the deepest level, this movie deals with secret societies. What goes on behind the scenes of the true \\"Elite\\". Tom Cruse's character is obviously rich, but he is nowhere near the level of rich as many of his patients, especially one who invites him yearly to his \\"Christmas\\" party. The symbolism at this party is rife with illuminati symbols. The plethora of 8 pointed stars alight everywhere. The \\"Christmas\\" trees, which most think, even most Christians,is a Christian symbol...It's not. The line where the \\"models/prostitutes\\" promise to take Tom Cruise to the \\"End of the Rainbow\\" etc...Intrestingly both had power elite names, one being Windsor (The Queen of England).<br /><br />Finally, The ceremony at the mansion replete with chanting, the censer of smoke, naked bodies, wild sex and human sacriice. Can anyone say \\"Witchcraft?\\" The threats that come after this, and the cover ups. Power Elite people, power elite. Anyway, Stanley Kubrick told us a lot about what goes on in his world, maybe more than he should have, he did die in the middle of making this. But, I will leave off on this line of reasoning, lest I be accused of being a conspiracy theorist! I believe the title \\"Eyes Wide Shut\\" has more to do with society. Our refusal to see what is right before our very eyes. This seems like just a movie, and for those who see it that way, you might not like it at all. For those of us whose eyes are wide OPEN, there's a lot to learn and understand here.<br /><br />I only gave it four stars, because I didn't like the ending, it seemed a bit anti-climactic. I think the movie, \\"The Firm\\" did a better job of wrapping things up, especially when dealing with a movie such as this, full of conspiracy!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway surfers is the best game ever ! I love it it's so so super and new features!once you upgrade it I couldn't think of a neater game.
B003V4AK8E|1.0|Fast forward about two weeks from buying this controller and it's worse than the one that I replaced it with.  Besides the 'X' button sticking (I don't know why) the left directional pad apparently registers as an \\"upper-left\\" instead of \\"up\\" when I press up.  As a result, on _every_ game that I play with this controller, my characters spin to the left when I'm trying to move forward so I have to slightly move to the upper-right to correct it, which then makes the character begin moving that direction, so I have to push it \\"up\\", which then starts this stupid cycle all over again.  Replacing the batteries didn't fix the spin-issue.  I would recommend _not_ buying this controller.  Just spend the extra money on a new PS3 controller made by _Sony_ (since they actually know what they're doing).
B007VUA7VO|5.0|I yous it a lot for knowing persisly how much battery I have...but ot doesn't read crectly if its plugged in.
B009NY43NY|5.0|I loved this whole series and I hate that it had to end but at least it ended great!!! Sookie forever:)
B00CEIGYAG|5.0|In the past few years I became really annoyed by electronic music. I just didn't like it because it was not BRILLIANT, but there was an exception: DAFT PUNK. This is the kind of music that doesn't want to make your eardrums bleed and is fun to listen. This song in particular is exactly what I was waiting for: a contemporary perfectly elaborated electronic song. Lets face it, Daft Punk are the kings in the electronic music industry and perhaps this is a lesson for all the so called \\"composers\\" nowadays.
B007CI81IQ|5.0|I found this book to be very eye opening. It was interesting to hear what the problems the economy of the poor really are. It's not just a lack of money; it's learning where it should be spent and learning how the poor think. I highly recommend this book.
B00005MM67|5.0|This is one of the finest acting jobs Michael Biehn has ever done!!! His chemistry with Matt Craven was amazing. I must have watched this movie 10 times so far. I wish Michael could find more roles like this. This is also one of the finest Mountain Climbing movies ever made. The only one that comes close is \\"Into Thin Air\\" Whoever casting K2 should be given an award. Patricia Charbonneau was also amazing, along with all the other cast members. They simply don't make movies like this anymore.Now one last thing the song that plays during the ending credits is one of the finest most beautiful songs I ever heard. Touches my soul. Thank you Hans Zimmer!!!
B008XKSW7M|5.0|I bought this book when I got pregnant first time. I used it as a month to month guide. It was great, very helpful, very informative, and humorous so all the aches and pains of pregnancy became a joke. I still found it very helpful during my second pregnancy.<br />I love this book!
B002JVWQSW|5.0|My son saw an episode of Modern Family and thought this is something we can watch together on Pizza night.  We have great fun watching the craziness that takes place.  Cameron is my favorite.
B003A9OVS0|4.0|Yet again another prime example of the ever forward experimentation of Gorillaz.. While familiar overall, all of the songs presented are a pleasant experiment in music as is the momentum expected.
B007ZGBZHE|5.0|This was a great read and kept me up late some nights because I couldn't wait to see what happened next.
B004QZ9PLU|5.0|I loved this book. It kept me interested through the whole thing. I didnt expect most of what happened. At times i smiled at at other times i wanted to cry.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|I love this app it is super cool and has good features I would totally reccomend getting this app it rocks
B001AH6ZWY|5.0|I showed this film to the members of the science fiction club at the high school where I teach.  All who saw it were impressed with the story and the quality of the acting.  I highly recommend it to anyone interested in this topic.
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|this is the best game that I have ever played. I love this game because it is like temple run to me but other than tht it is fun.
B00BGIC2J2|1.0|We had a babysitter over to watch our son.  I gave her the access code to our Roku so she could watch a movie.  Since the rental was good for 24 hours, I was able to get through the first 5 minutes before becoming nauseated.
B00BTYP6QE|5.0|dis game is so awsom i play every day and its so fun. my favorite nomnom is the little pirate!
B00B2G2RG6|2.0|I like Kevin Bacon, and the premise of a cult could be interesting, but the final product didn't cut it.  I saw the whole series because a friend liked it, and I wanted to be able to discuss it with her. Most stories require some leap of faith, but once I accept a premise, I like it to be subject to the laws of physics and the real world in some partly recognizable way.  This series stretched incredulity too far, past the breaking point. The cult couldn't always be so lucky, the FBI so stupid and unlucky, and where was all the huge amounts of money coming from that bought the helicopter, paid the pilots, bought the compound, etc.?  I love The Walking Dead, Breaking Bad, Justify, etc., so it's not like I don't have an imagination but this just underestimated its audience.  I won't watch an episode of season 2.  I am done.
B00ABKGG0C|5.0|I just can't find anything wrong with this book.<br />Usually there are nagging discrepancies somewhere, or the plot takes a backseat to a main character's guilty conscience, but Anthony Ryan has managed a book with a hero unafraid to do what must be done, a man haunted but not hindered by his actions. Finally a main character I can enjoy instead of berate silently while I read.<br />  This alone is worth five stars, but there's the fluid pacing to consider, the sneaky but effective exposition, and the seamless way supporting characters are explored without feeling forced, such as the stories of Barkus and Dentos.<br />  (SPOILER ALERT)<br />Knowing the cliffhanger knowledge of the departed, and the tale of the witch's bastard, Anyone else suspicious of brother Caenis? And what of Frentis? Are we all checking previous chapters for anyone else who was close to death, anyone He Who Waits can use for his plans?<br /><br />I wish I hadn't found this book early enough to have to await future installments. I'll bet he gets this series completed before A Song Of Ice and Fire: Book Six is available, so it's a wait either way. Fingers crossed for volume two!
B00AZRBLHO|5.0|This book explains how to reform an IT organization in an enjoyable fictional format.  Though the course of the story the people learn a structured way to organize and reform a failing IT organization.  In the end the company learns that IT is a part of everything they do, so the entire company must develop IT as a core competency.  A company doesn't have a &#34;reading&#34; department or a &#34;math&#34; department... each department is expected to be able to do those things.  IT is the same way.  It is pervasive as electricity.<br /><br />The writing is very good. The story is believable.  In fact, the first couple chapters where you learn how bad things are I wanted to cry: Not because I felt bad for the characters but because I realized that this terrible situation is &#34;normal&#34; for most companies.<br /><br />This book teaches best practices I'm already familiar with and added greatly to my &#34;toolbox&#34; of knowledge... but in every case illustrated them via storytelling that brings them to life. It puts all the techniques in context and gives the reader both a strategic view and a tactical view.  By wrapping it all into &#34;the 3 ways&#34; it becomes something that you can apply to every situation.<br /><br />Highly recommended!
193700788X|5.0|I have read all the different negative and positive reviews about this book, and I have to say that I am happy with the ending.  It was time for the series to end, and the last few books have been winding down the different aspects of Sookie's life and the ending was not a surprise to me.  I felt that Sookie would end up being just like she did and with the person she ended up with pretty early in the series, so I wasn't surprised or disappointed.  It's a good easy read like all of the Sookie books and the pace was fine with me.

B008673ZAQ|5.0|I couldn't put this book down. Now on to the next one.......I can't wait!! Gideon cross is my kind of man.
B001TKMAGW|1.0|Please note that is a review of the DELUXE EDITION ONLY, NOT the actual \\"Black Sabbath\\" album!<br /><br />Simply put, this \\"Deluxe Edition\\" is pointless, and a waste of money.  Of course the selling points here is the bonus disc and the packaging: both of which are not worth spending your money on.<br /><br />The bonus disc:  Completely unnecessary.  The additional tracks/outtakes are maybe a few seconds longer or shorter than the originals.  ALSO, the instrumental of N.IB. is NOT HERE, although the packaging says otherwise...it's just the normal version with vocals.  The only additional song in this entire package is \\"Evil Woman\\", which was on the England Version of the album INSTEAD of Wicked World (which was on the U.S. version).  If you need this song in your life/collection, you now have it.  Whoop-Dee-Doo.<br /><br />The packaging:  I was hoping for the original album version here, albeit in CD form, where there's an upside down cross that folds out.  It's not here.  Instead, we get the same-ol, same ol \\"Story of Early Black Sabbath\\", which we all heard (in various forms) time and time again.  Aside from a few photos, there is nothing exciting here, and NO LYRICS AT ALL.  Why NOT put them in here?  After all, it's a \\"Deluxe Edition\\", right?<br /><br />So there you have it:  A complete waste of time and effort and money.<br /><br />Sorry if I ruined this for anyone.
B009T3AE1Y|2.0|Tried to read the book but couldn't finish it. Knew when I ordered the movie it would not be a favorite. It is too intellectual for me, I guess. And though Robert is a good actor, the stoic, repressed chsracter he played was too much like Edward Cullen for me.
B00CJVZB5W|5.0|I Can't put into words how much I love his new album.  I have loved all of his songs from the very beginning. This new album is his best by far.  My favorite is Can't stop me now. He seems to evolve with age,elegantly,and his music reflects that.  Bravo, Mr. Stewart.
B0030IIYYS|4.0|My daughter loves this movie, and all the Toy Story movies! Bought brand new and has lasted a long time.
B00AHSIQWE|5.0|Good action and plot.  I am not a big batman fan but this was pretty good, great cast for the roles!
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Good game. Hints start out vague, but if you need more info you can tap again and get something a little clearer.  Makes you think and is a good way to kill an afternoon or two.

B009329ZF2|5.0|I was not so sure about this one, but it turned out to be a fun movie to watch overall.
B00AHTYI5M|5.0|Once again, Ben Affleck has scored a fabulous movie and directing job. Well worth the time to watch! You will be glad you did!
B000JMKTLO|2.0|Too disturbing.  Protagonist was mentally ill and uninteresting.  Some jumpy, but not the kind to want to continue reading.  Read another book, not this one.
B00CDT41RY|3.0|I used to like Quentin Tarantino's movie, Pulp Fiction, Desperado, then it started to get a little bit over the top and out of control. From the last three movies he made, Inglorious Bastards is the best. The story of Django Unchained is pretty simple and predictable with a few weird flaws. Unfortunately, the presentation of the story is the one that shut me down, especially for the last hour of the movie. The movie started out alright then it's getting really gory (which is unnessecary)and way too many curse words. The last hour is a torture when the main smart character who is so good in what he does became so bad in hiding his feeling from his expression, and finally also made a very bad decision caused by a small little thing (watch out for spoiler) such as a handshake. That just doesn't make sense. Then, it ended very badly and incredibly gory. It seems like that event ocured to open another chance for the director to show more dramatically gory and totally unrealistic action scene.<br /><br />And then, they still add another good 20 minutes to end themovie with another super unrealistic shoot out scene and typically gory Tarantion's style action (and don't forget all the curse words and brutal mentality). Long story short, there are too much unnessecary \\"dark things\\" in them ovie with many unrealistic plot and action scene.<br /><br />I still respect Tarantino as he is, that's why I give this movie 3 stars. Trust me, I got attached at the first half of the movie and the second half? I really can't wait for it to be over.<br /><br />Two Academy Award winner and a few nomination? This is the very first time I don't agree with the nominations at all since 1998 may be. If you want a good western movie, there a lot better movies out there. If you want a great intriguing storyline, there a lot better ones out there, too. If you are a big fan of Tarantino or a very different kind of storytelling, then this is your movie.<br /><br />For me? I'm sorry Tarantino, Pulp Fiction, Desperado, Reservoir Dog and Inglorious Bastard are my top four. The rest is very predictable typical Tarantino (Kill Bill, Kill Bill 2, Sukiyaki Western Django, this one,Death Proof)style.<br /><br />Hope this helps.
B001NLKT60|5.0|Great fast moving story read one book right after another good pace interesting characters just keeps you going trying to find out what happens next very well done.
B00CFOXBX2|5.0|Movie deserves 5 stars time two, if possible. Why? Let me explain.<br /><br />The Insider - Russell Crowe had a fit of anger & throws a ash tray at a hotel employees, hmm the Tobacco  lobbyist are everywhere including movies in a subliminal way, they simply don't want the truth about smoking cigarettes kills 443,000 Americans every year.<br /><br />Red Corner - Richard Gere & Bai Ling. Both excellent acting careers, I suppose they both annoyed China's PLA strong arm of their PR division. They \\"outed Richard Richard Gere for being different.\\" His reply was so what, I'll travel to Tibet & joined the \\"Free Tibet movement\\" I'm sure the PLA wasn't expecting his \\"try me\\" along w/ the one two punch of China's persecution of Tibetan monks & Dalia Lama....Bai Ling? Knowing visit Shandong Province in China, watched her like a hawk to the point she had urges to shop lift 15 bucks worth from a store?<br /><br />Lord of War - Nicholas Cage received the amnesty International award for the acting role of  a dramatized yet true to life gun runner. The NRA, had their \\"scope\\" on him.... appeared to be indifferent to his cause & had tipped the LAPD for arguing w/ his wife & was charged for \\"public drunkenness\\" Suppose the NRA didn't like his donation of $2 million to provide shelters, medical and psychological rehabilitation for child soldiers in ruined countries.<br /><br />Side Effects - Jude Law plays a role precisely as a Psychiatrist when his practice is to counsel and prescribe medications only to find he was merely a pawn taking the money to have trial runs on medication the FDA never approved, but played the role of exposing the dangerous game of exposing the pharmaceutical Industry. I'm sure he has made enemies in the pharma industry. I hope the FDA tightens their grip on the pharma industry, this movie is very close to reality.<br /><br />This movie doesn't deserve 5 stars but 10 because it's all about drugs & derivatives.
B004P4S4NM|5.0|The first time I heard Adele sing was on the Grammy awards.  I fell in  love with her sound and she is beautiful.  This is the first female artest that I have ever purchased.  I am like a teenager with my new music as I love to listen to it all the time.  She has such a wide varity of emotions in each song that they just never get old.  She is a wonderful singer and I just wish she had more albums out there to bye.  I think 21 is the best.
B00BQI4AU6|5.0|This is the best cd I have bought in a long time. Highly reccomend to anyone that loves good rock. Its just as good as any Cinderella album. I have every album that they recorded. The more I listen to this cd, the better I like it. If you buy it I am sure you will not be disappointed. I love every track.
B003P2WO5E|5.0|I discovered Brandons writing through WOT and decided to give Elantris a try after I finished the epic. I really enjoyed its uniqueness, completely oblivious to the Cosmere at that point. Tried Mistborn after that and LOVED it!! That series alone made me a fan for life. When Stormlight came out, I was soooo excited, and after just finishing my second readthrough, I can say the excitement was warranted!!! It is my absolute favotite book thus far. I'm intrigued by the world, characters, cosmere and all!!!! CAN NOT WAIT for the next book!!! Kudos to Brandon! Please keep em coming!
B009KS4XRO|1.0|PLEASE KEEP UP AMAZON! STILL CANT UPDATE, SO STILL NO ATHENS! IT'S BEEN ON MY ANDROID PHONE FOR 3 DAYS! Thank you
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Best ending ever the ups the downs kept me on my feet this book will always be in my favorites collection
B00BMKDTNC|4.0|With so many strings to tie together is was inevitable that some of the storylines were less than fulfilling but nevertheless an enjoyable read.<br /><br />So now will there be a new series After the Dragon?<br /><br />Now there are so many new questions. What of Rands heirs? And Matt's? What about Bridgette and Gaidol/Olver? Will she be reborn as one of Elayne's daughters?<br /><br />I guess I could go on and on but no need to. I look forward to what may be coming in the future from Sanderson.<br /><br />I would certainly recommend the book for all of Robert Jordan fans as well as Sanderson fans. It was an excellent read!<br /><br />M
B004JM8X5E|5.0|This movie has to be one of the best movies I have ever seen. It will make you cry, it will make you laugh, smile. It will absolutely touch your heart to a depth that you didn't even think you could achieve.  I have never before watched a movie that could take me on so many  different levels of emotion , it's a fantastic ride from start to finish and in the end it will leave you feeling satisfied and more peaceful in life than what you felt before you watched  this movie .This movie is absolutely electrifying it will reach deep down into the  recesses of your most inner self and Kindle the fires of your soul.
B00BCOQSSQ|4.0|In the case of full disclosure, I had received this book from the author in exchange for a review. I'm not receiving anything else from Roy or any of the author's that I review books for so this is my review without any bias.<br /><br />The best thing I can say about this book is it makes you want to read the rest of the series. It started right into it without delay. The first half of the book your introduced to the characters as well as a whole other world and species. What Roy does right with this book is you learn the backstory while going through the current story lines. So your not stuck in the past while learning about it. These worlds are constantly colliding in battles and Them are getting closer and closer to conquering Everville and that's where the college students at Easton Falls University come in. You go back and forth from a battle between teams at the University to a battle of life and death outside Everville and the collision of both worlds in the end.<br /><br />This was definitely a good read and I recommend it. The only negative is you have to wait for the next book to be released. But I have good news, because starting tomorrow (5/12/13) you can get this book for free on Amazon (Kindle version only) so be sure to go pick it up. It's only free for a limited time (thru 5/16/13) so go get it today - http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00BCOQSSQ.
B009NY43NY|3.0|I knew from the very first books she was going to end up with Sam.  I saw that a mile away.  The book was okay.  I feel she brought back too many characters and didn't do justice to any of them because of that.  They all seemed to get short shrift.  Eric loved Sookie; just not enough.  His was a very selfish love.  I think a lot of people are pro-Eric because of Alexander Skarsgård (yum).  But if you read the books you will see he is very selfish; but that was part of his charm!  But one of the most important parts of the this book was when he confessed to Sookie that he should have turned her without her permission.  Sookie would have hated that.  And when Sookie was looking at Pam & Karin, both blonde warriors, she knew that is what she would have ended up as.<br /><br />As for the animosity towards CH, it's ridiculous!  Criticize the book and her writing style; not personal attacks on the author.  CH writes for herself, not her fans.  She told the story her way.  It's her imagination; not yours.  She has every right to end the book as she sees fit.  It is our choice then whether to buy the book or not.  But personal attacks are very nasty.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I love this game! but I wish they would add temple run 3 water rafting. I would so donloud it!

1423165691|5.0|Being an animation major, I enjoy seeing how the base sketches and designs evolve into the final product. There are many characters spanning years of disney animation, spanning from Mickley Mouse to Repunsel from Tangled. I highly recommend this as a great vew into original character sketching.
B007NZQU72|5.0|when I first read the characteristics of  highly sensitive person, I saw me.  It seems every day I figure out a piece of the puzzle of my self-discovery.  I'm still working on boundaries.
B00CFOXBX2|4.0|Soderbergh/Burns do an excellent job of keeping the suspense alive. Though many moments worked themselves out the way I thought they would, I still couldn't be sure. Genius work of swapping roles between antagonist/protagonist as well as an honest approach to these roles in psyco-pharma and insider trading. Soderbergh/Burns make the emotions and tension very real to the viewer.<br /><br />A job well done.
B0013TXA5Y|2.0|First, let me say that I've read this book twice. I read the first three books 3ish years ago, and did not like them. With all the hype about the new movie, I decided to reread and see if I couldn't get into it a little more. I finished the first one and it was just as awful as I remembered it being. First off, I've noticed a lot of people complaining that it is very similar to a number of series. This is true. The book is basically stuffed full of every super popular, super recognizable, and often overused or stupid trope there is, and she doesn't really do anything I can tell to make them new or different or fresh. I also had difficulties with a couple of the stereotypes that where there. I don't feel that the author handled the issue of homosexuality very well, for one.<br /><br />I also am really disliking this theme (which is in a LOT of YA books right now, bot just Clare's) of this drop dead gorgeous girl who doesn't realize she's beautiful. I realize that this is something that a lot of teen girls deal with in real life, even the ones that are basically flawless; however, you'll notice when authors use this character, she is almost always white, slender, doesn't have acne problems, doesn't have crooked teeth, isn't flat-chested--basically, the character is the epitome of western beauty, and I find that this really is a missed opportunity to drive the point home that you don't have to fit this mold to be beautiful. But, I'll get off my high horse.<br /><br />While this is utterly trivial and probably will not affect most readers, I hated that shout out to the characters from Holly Black's Valiant. They're not even set in the same universe! How does that make even a modicum of sense?<br /><br />Still, with all of that going on, my biggest problem with the book is this: It reads like Cassandra Clare was teased as a child, came up with all these super witty comebacks about three hours too late to actually use them, wrote them all down in a composition notebook somewhere, and then decided to write a fantasy story with the sole goal of fitting as many of those witty comebacks into the story as possible. So, in short, I'm REALLY unimpressed with the dialogue, haha.<br /><br />That being said, I can see how this book might appeal to some people. I do love YA fiction, but as a 20 year old, I fall a little outside of the intended reader demographic. I'm also a total bookworm, and have read enough to see a lot of the tropes in multiple books before I read City of Bones. I am also at times a picky reader and have very high standards for what I consider to be good writing.
B005LAIII0|5.0|A great choice, all the way around.  It reminds me of a great philosophical novel.  For anyone who loves adventure.
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|and having a digital copy of this book even though I already own the paperback only adds to my obsession.
B00499BTP8|5.0|It was almost impossible to lay the book down.  Most of the &#34;twists and turns&#34; were unpredictable.  I had the chance to say AHA , as I recall, only once.  The ending was terrific.  I loved it.  Jack
B00B47NO2O|4.0|SPOILER ALERT<br />Was preparing to give this 5 stars up until the final 3 minutes. In the final minutes they did the predictable thing and resorted to the tired and way over used \\"Cliff Hanger\\" ending. Really disappointing. This was a great 15 episode story. Like a great book, it should have had a great ending with some finality to it. Instead, leaving both Hardy and Claire stabbed and bleeding on the floor was nothing more than an unimaginative hook to get people to tune in for season 2.<br />There is no rule that says that all stories have to have a happy ending. The series 24 proved that for 7 of their 8 seasonS. Just wish that the writers and producers of The Following had more confidence in their own abilities and NOT have to resort to this type of cheap theatrics.<br />That having been said, 99·9% of the series was extremely engaging and entertaining. A real thriller. Bacon and Purefoy were amazing in their roles.
B003GEDLW6|5.0|Music that's not like anything else. Pendulum created its own unique sound that is examplified on this album.  If you want to know what Bass & Drum is then this CD is a must have,
B00B6QXN56|3.0|I was really expecting more from the cd. I'll either have to buy the video or miss many of the songs I really wanted to hear.
B001P9EQH8|4.0|I used the E5 to boost bass and volume on my Sony XB 700 headphones and XB 41EX earbuds. It delivered a nice boost in the lower frequencies without affecting anything else. After about six months, the headphone out jack stopped working. It's definitely worth the price if you're looking for something cheap.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|This system is a GREAT ALARM Thanks I only have one suggestion which is  more sounds  but other wise I really like it
B005IQZB14|1.0|Sadly, I was disappointed with this first time novel. Expecting more of the travails and challenges of the CPT by a solo woman hiker, the author focused too much on her personal hang-ups and sexual trysts. A Walk in the Woods by Byron is a much better read!
193700788X|1.0|Sookie feel asleep in the sun, and she was dreaming the ending of the previous book and this book. She has been kidnapped into a bad plot with shadow characters.  That would be the best if a book 14 started out that way.  I really did not like the way the book literally changed all the characters.  Eric is a wimp and not a vampire.  He has a second child who is nothing more than a night time guard dog.  Not even true to vampire character. She would have killed a intruder and not tied him up.  So many different endings come to mind to the series.  I even thought of her and Eric escaping to a fantasy place where both of them are human.  A sort of  Fae land were they could both be in the sun.  Or a deep magic is done that turns him human for awhile,but he is miserable so Sookie lets him go to be his true self.  But not to be. Eric is gone. He left before the book started.  The real Eric.  Bill is so out of character,a tattle tale really not something Bill would do. Sam well I don't know he is reborn and he turns into a wimp. Really???Not once did he shift change.  Claude turns ugly literally.  I just didn't like it.  I am sorry I bought it and I refuse to buy her wrap up book.  This should have been the wrap up book if she was ending the series.
B000OZ0NXA|5.0|very good story line.  Jack Reacher is a well developed character and very different than most murder-mystery lead characters.  Looking forward to reading the rest of the Jack Reacher books.

B004ZZS4CC|5.0|Her words expressed everything she went thru as the reader you see it all whether it be good or bad.  She has the ability to capture the readers interest and hold it to the end just like a roller coaster.  She holds nothing back and lays it all out for everyone to see which makes this book one of the best.  You will not be disappointed in this one.
B002QYSZBO|5.0|He's not Ironman but the personality is much the same, Michelle Monaghan is drop dead gorgeous, and Val Kilmer is at his best. The plot twists and turns-fast,but is resolved quite well
B003P2WO5E|5.0|So far as an epic series of novels is concerned this is an incredible opener. The main characters really drew me in and the history and age of the world invented made it feel so real. I really felt for the struggles successes and suffering all the characters endured.

B00COGZ8FU|3.0|It's such a shame as this could have been a great movie. Instead it was slow in many parts and not gripping or really that exciting. Could be the worst movie he has ever done. However, it gets three stars as my mother in law really enjoyed it.

B008IJT0CE|5.0|I downloaded this program on my Kindle, which I then plug into an iHome charger/clock radio base and use as white noise to go to sleep and recharge my Kindle each night. A terrific selection of sounds that can be combined in a variety of ways, with a separate volume setting for each sound, to create whatever blend I need for the night. I had used the free version and liked it, but love the full version with the greater selection of sounds and I'm glad I upgraded.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|I would recommend this book to anyone who's interested in reading it, it's such an amazing book. There was nothing I disliked all though I hate to see the series come to an end.
B00AHTYGRW|4.0|Even though you know the outcome, sort of, this is still a good nailbiter of who will and won't, and how will they get it done. And it's Ben Affleck, so, you're gonna want to watch it. With all the government underhanded dealings today, it's almost a refreshing reminder that it's been this way for a long time.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|This was fantastic and I couldn't put it down.  I hope the next one is equally as great or better.
0446547646|2.0|I was so excited to get this book because I have read all of Sparks' books and for the most part I have loved them all. This is by far his worst novel. It is a Sparks' novel so I've come to expect certain themes in his books. This book is no exception, but the issue was the last few chapters. They were awful and very rushed. I knew what was exactly going to happen with about 5 chapters left. The book also has an epilogue that made the book even worse. It should have been left out. I hope his next book is better and I am not looking forward to the movie that has already been scheduled. If you have not read Safe Haven by Sparks I recommend it instead!
0061950726|4.0|I tend to like stories that start in the present but the bulk of the story is in the past--this was one of those. I was less interested in teenage Molly's story than Vivan's (I think this was done much better in Calling Me Home in which I was equally interested in the \\"young\\" person's current story as the old woman's story of her youth), but Molly didn't overwhelm the story.<br /><br />I had read some nonfiction years ago about the orphan trains but had forgotten all about them. Encountering the subject in fictional form in such a well told and interesting story was a real treat!
B004ZZS4CC|5.0|I really enjoyed this book. At the time, I lived about 15 miles away from where Jaycee was held captive. I was shocked that something so horrible could have been hidden in plain sight for so long. I have followed Jaycees story and I am so glad that she and her girls are recovering from the torment that they endured at the hands of the Garridos. You are a strong woman and a testament to us all!
B009NY43NY|5.0|You want know why I'm giving this book 5 stars? Because it deserves it.  I almost didn't buy it because of all the bashing - but I love Sookie's story and bought it anyway and I'm glad I did.<br />First - it is very true to the original books that were great.  Harris has always balanced the everyday wanderings of Sookie's life with the extraordinary drama that follows her.  That's Sookie!  She cooks, cleans, walks to the mailbox - and in between she saves lives, kills people who deserve it and defends the weak. Its called balance folks!<br />Another great point is that for once, she has humans and a few sups show their loyalty to her without her having to do anything to deserve it.  Well, she did 12 or 13 books worth of stuff - but in this book - she just is Sookie, good friend and family member who needs help.  And she gets it.And isn't that how it should end? With the love of family and friends around her? Yes!<br />Spoiler alert! Eric is who he is and in the end, she shows that she's always understood this (typical Sookie). And - Sam is who he is, proving that her judgement in friends and uncanny ability to gauge people's true character is spot on.<br />It is a good story and Ms. Harris - do not be discouraged by the lower reviews. It is apparent to me that you've always understood your characters far better than we ever could.  Sookie is the same woman she was in book 1, perhaps a little wiser and maybe slightly jaded (if having common sense can be called jaded) but she is still her. Except for once - her family, friends and neighbors are bringing her the casseroles and back up.<br />I loved this book and think it ended perfectly - with Sookie not having to give up one thing for the love of a man (or vampire), with a future she dreamed of (or that we dream for her), and with her humanity intact. Thank you for a fine ending.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Fun game. I would recommend it. Not to hard to earn gems but don't waste them. Over all a great game.
0151003084|5.0|I was not paying attention to the size of the book for I was very surprised the book was so small. I love it so much.
B0012CCNUU|5.0|I was already familiar with this album and the songs. THEY ARE ALL GREAT!! Every single one of the artists is a star!
B009K72G8I|5.0|This series in the Star Wars saga actually helped bridge the gap between II & III from the movie. Now I have a better understanding of the story line and actually enhances the movies.
B003TSEL7S|5.0|I love, love, love this series so much that I would do anything for the author because it is so good
B002UNMW7O|5.0|I love this movie and love Norman Reedus and Sean Patrick Flanery. They r amazing actors and did a great job in this movie as they did in the 1st Boondock Saints
B005HSG3VK|5.0|It  took 4 months for my fire's case to be put in stock, my receipt said it would be shipped in 2 weeks after that. But a awesomess thing happened, they were kind enough to ship it a week early.<br />  I will go over the case details now.<br />I got a pink case, and let me say, the colors burst out with pizzazz! The kindle fire slides into the colored part of the inside of the case and safely snaps the it into place. The black flap go's over the kindle and you can lift the band over the black part to sucure the kindle and keep it safe. When you open case you probably want the flap out of your way, so you can put the band on the back side and put over the flap.<br />  Thank you for reading my review!
B00BHHIWQO|3.0|I would give it 5 Stars if the problems get fixed. It freezes up then I have to uninstall it and reinstall it just to get it to work again. The good news is that it still saves the level you were at. Just wish you could fix the glitches.
B00CHI5B7A|4.0|This movie is no LA Confidential, but its worth watching. I felt like some of the plot points were a little over-dramatized but it held my interest and it has some good actors in it.
1609611543|5.0|It is a totally amazing book teaching us what now goes into our foods. I've learned to check every label to see if wheat is used and let me tell  you wheat is in everything.
B0076DCT2G|5.0|I'm a longtime fan of DeMille's books and enjoy the wit, irony and sarcasm of the anti-heroes in his novels.  When this book was first released, I read some less than enthusiastic reviews and put off buying it.  I wasn't sure whether I'd be disappointed as some were.<br />  But I love the ex-Det. John Corey stories and The Panther is no exception.  I'm only part-way through reading it, but give it 5 stars, find it very enjoyable and definitely recommend it.
B000FC12YQ|4.0|Standard Poirot, captivating, fun. Easy to figure out some parts but always a few surprises. Fun easy read. Will keep reading Christie novels.
B009NY43NY|2.0|I just finished this book last nite and had to force myself to finish it!!  As a big fan of this series I was shocked at how bad this book was.  How could the author end such a popular book series with such a boring book?  Where were the vampires, Bill and Eric??  What happened?  Was she as bored writing it as we were reading it?  I kept waiting for a twist but it was pretty obvious how it was going to end before I was half-way thru.  The author really let us all down.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|I loved missle command bad!!!! And have tried to relive it in various forms. The game however is superior. With the ability to upgrade. Awsome!!!
B0027MJU00|5.0|I have had book hangover for two weeks now!!! This has became my new favorite book ever. I have read Gillian Flynn's other book but this is the best.
B002U5HKZ6|4.0|better than TV, more interesting than most movies.  An interesting read that gives lots of context and color through its descriptions of India and Afganistan.
B008C1O8CA|4.0|No surprises here. Green Day puts out a solid cd. Just nothing &#34;new&#34; like &#34;American Idiot&#34; or &#34;21st Century&#34;. I was anticipating it to be better. But I still enjoy the cd.
B00CL68NOG|4.0|Its a nicely different twist on the road trip movie.  Had a mom that loved me that much and with as many funny side-effects but I was nuts enough to join in on the &#34;embarrassing&#34; moments more often than not.
B008J34466|5.0|I don't think there is another female rock performer out there that equals her. I wasn't a &#34;fan&#34; before, but her last cd and this one are amazing from beginning to end. Keep them coming P!nk. I am going to see her in concert and cannot wait..
B00BAB6CNC|4.0|Completed story. very good story.<br /><br />When you get house of gold and bones 1 and 2 it makes a house with the two CD cases.<br /><br />both CDs come with a small book telling a story that goes along with the songs.
B006M4RN3U|5.0|Every song is amazing. I am going to see them in concert and cannot wait. The vocals are solid. I strongly recommend this cd.
B0071MUR26|5.0|This is an adult movie, language, and adult sex language.  but very funny.  It follows the typical Ben Stiller type of movie. Ben's character is serious and the misfit group of guys is a great cast.
B00CKOYVG8|1.0|This game requires you to have a Facebook account to do any more than tutorial mode when you play it.
B005P39GOI|5.0|I listen to this so much I should be sick of it by now, but I'm not. Not by a long shot.
B0094BB4TW|3.0|This app needs to be updated as frequently as the other android and mobile versions!  Half the time most pics will not load and it constantly posts double comments (same comment posts twice back to back when the 'post' button is only used one time). Also frequently give 'network failure' notifications when there are no problems with the network!
B003X7MCGW|5.0|I've loved The Black Crowes from the first time I heard them.  This CD is exactly as expected. Excellent music!
B0091REZMW|4.0|I enjoyed the game for as far as I made it. Hope you give it a try if you like hidden object games.
B00BDAP66E|2.0|I can't manage my business page from this app.  When I get a notification, it lists all past notifications and I normally can't even find the current one.  I also cannot post anything to my business page, just my personal one.
B005I6EVUG|5.0|fits great wished it had a hook for the stylus and that it had a latch but other wise great item good quality
B00454U1NS|3.0|I found this to be all over the place. Who knew one singer could be so inconsistent with her style of music.
B00BEJ5O6Q|5.0|Another great album of songs from Blake. I like all his music. I think he has got more exposure from him being on the Voice program. Makes you want to check out his music.
B00785P2QC|4.0|Hi, I think virtual city playground is a fun game and I enjoy playing it very much so.I recommend this game to everyone.
B0011NVCSO|5.0|this is great sunday afternoon listening, relaxing, enjoying flipping the record and active listening.<br /><br />this was an instant classic and i don't really need to sell you on the content, but just know it sounds better on vinyl.
B0000024JN|5.0|I love this album.One of the best in the history of rap music.I like these white boys.Gotta have in your collection if you love rap.
030759565X|5.0|I love this cookbook for the gorgeous photography plus the recipes are unusual yet don't call for impossible to find ingredients!  Love to just sit and read this one..
B00004YRQA|5.0|These memory cards are old but they still do the trick for the playstation 2.Though I wish they had the guitars for ps3's at the stores, but they don't.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game is the bomb! Ever since I started playing this,  I just couldn't wait for the next update. Except it's a bit laggy.
B008RA3X5E|4.0|The sleep timer is going to come in veryhandy.  I mmay add more informationto my review after I've used the app for awhile
B00BEZTMFY|4.0|new version of the book and former film with the use of the same characters of the triology. fair with the book but not enough.
B00BUCW54Q|1.0|Not sure what Tom Cruise and the gang in Holly wood were thinking of putting this film together for mass consumption? But it is quite obvious they put together a complete utter failure. This is certainly one of the worst movies Tom has ever been in or behind. Tom has been in much better projects that didn't come across one dimensional and painfully paced. I had three family members sitting down to watch this with me and all three decided it would be more fun to start the Bar-B-Q early and left me to wade in this movie muck. Simply, it is just yuck and unmemorable.
B00AESN8XY|5.0|This is an amazing game! It is worth the money spent! I also love the music and graphics. Buy this game!
B0012CH350|5.0|We have used it for about a year, works great, no problems. It will even fit our new smoker, we will probably keep it for other BBQs.
B003ZSJ212|4.0|i enjoy Star Wars and this is the entire set (Until new Disney episodes come out). Very good collectors item.
044654759X|1.0|I was disappointed at the very end to be surprised with a spiritistic, magical ending. I do not usually expect this from Nicholas sparks, I wish I hadn't read the book. Or that the back had in some way warned about this aspect of the book.
B000002OOY|4.0|John Williams seems to always write good soundtracks.  This captures the excitement of the movie.  The main theme is repeated many times on the CD.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I love that the revolution in self publishing is allowing great works like this to rise to the top.<br /><br />What a great read, each page flip was exciting.<br /><br />Keep them coming!
B0073TZ1AA|2.0|I guess if I was blind or lazy this would be perfect but I don't really like it so I deleted it.
B0087IT8FK|5.0|This is one of my top 5 movies of all time now. The writing and acting are brilliant, it's hilarious and extraordinarily touching at the same time!
B00BP4Z8XY|3.0|Good movie kids liked it.<br />I did not are for it. Not much for adults . Rent it for your children.
B00BUCW54Q|4.0|Tom Cruise delivers. I am not sure what people are expecting from movies these days. This is not the book. THIS IS THE MOVIE. Forget the bad reviews this is definately worth a rental.
B0083ZBW2Y|5.0|Rereading this as an adult revealed new dimensions of this classic book.  The parallels to the human urge for primacy are awesome and timeless.
B00BWJARHO|4.0|My goodness is this movie long but great. I gave it four stars but I would go 4 and a half. Definately worth a rental.
B00511ONPG|5.0|Recommend it to everyone I know with any interest in Social Media or marketing.  I review it frequently and have given copies away to friends.
B00CL6HGIK|4.0|Most people get on here to see if they should spend money on the reantal or purchase. Well if you like Mark Wahlberg then he delivers. Ok plot and great acting. I saw worth a rent.
B009CV7IIA|4.0|I loved this book. I don't read much but of everything I've read, nothing else has kept me this hooked. And the crazy thing is, I'm not even a guy that understands all of the 80s references (and the entire book is full of them). I can't imagine how much more I would have enjoyed this if I was a child of the 80s. But Cline's view of the world in 50 years, scarily accurate by the way, kept me hooked throughout. Plus the descriptive, futuristic, MMO world that is the focus of most of the book, was a fantastic vision of gaming that is both realistic and incredibly entertaining. The other great thing about this book is it wasn't overly long. There weren't the typical extraneous characters that most books have, and it got to the main point quickly (with a few exceptions).<br /><br />I only deducted a point because the ending didn't keep me hooked for some reason. I have theories why but I won't spoil anything.
B00BTYP6QE|5.0|Great game. Best of all of the cut the ropes. If you only going to get one I suggest this one.
B000W93CHC|5.0|Blasted through it, yet, hoped it would never end.  Great story and terrific characters.  Ken Follett is a wonderful storyteller.
B008VBYN80|4.0|I give this game  a triple A+ I think it's one of the best games around if you like to deal with Castles and knightes and also to build stuff.
B00B4VI8MQ|3.0|it was too repetitive and the end was rushed. I felt compelled to finish it though but overall it was rather boring.
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|I give it a 5 star Rating because not only is it a great game to play but it also teaches you about all the different kinds of dinosaurs there were so overall I give it a super duper A+
B00BSN0K1C|3.0|I am a sucker for Superman, always have been, always will be. This figure however, looks nothing like Henry Cavill who plays Superman/Clark Kent in the upcoming Man of Steel film. The production photos for this figure made it look NECA level quality and far better looking and more accurate to the source than this actual figure is. This figure is on par with the other Movie Masters figures in style and quality, just like the Dark Knight Rises figures actually. While this figure doesn't look quite like the actor much at all, has limited articulation and no accessories, i.e. lasers to attach to his eyes or even at least a cape which you can pose, I still like it. I also really like the card that the figure is blistered too, it's colorful and bright. Compared to the 3.75\\" figures currently being produced for this film (which look like absolute garbage) these actually look pretty good. I am just disappointed that the production photos of this figure floating around online for the past few months made me think this figure would look way better than it actually does. I have come to expect a certain level of standard from the Movie Masters series so I am not surprised, just disappointed that they didn't make the actual product look more like the photos or the source material. For the right price, this is a definite worthy purchase, but for more than $15, I wouldn't get this, it's just too simple and basic, with no features and not a very good likeness of Henry Cavill.
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|I cried many times while reading this touching story. Never could I have imagined such cruelty by people we are to trust.
0891419063|5.0|My uncle Eddie was killed on Okinawa.  He was 29th Regiment, Sixth Marine Division.  No one in his large family ever wanted to speak of his death; he was so loved.  Growing up, I was always curious about what he faced on the battlefield.  Now I know.
B000TDGGVU|2.0|It's terrible! We have too many choices to make! Oh, the burden!<br /><br />I read one fourth of the book, could not take it, and jumped to the last chapter to see if there were any conclusions I agreed with. Nope. This guy just keeps saying satisfiers are good with the choices, maximizers have a tough time.<br /><br />I don't agree. I'd rather have free enterprise and lots of choices, than a very limited selection. I agree with Gladwell's article republished in \\"What the dog saw\\", that says there is not a one \\"perfect for all\\" spaghetti sauce, but several. Why should we get less options so that a few obsessive don't struggle with choice?
B000UZNRS2|5.0|Great read,two stories that come together in a tense finish<br />Thoroughly enjoyed the book with all its tense twists and turns
B007IXWKUK|4.0|I was very surprised. This book almost had a decent storyline. I still get frustrated with Ana' s lack of self confidence, but I guess it's part of the story. I actually want to read the next book.
B000YAG00A|1.0|This DVD is of inferior quality to the one I bought some fifteen years ago.  This one is no wider (though it touts itself as widescreen edition) It is very dark almost impossible to watch and has motion glitches throughout with pixilated stoppages also.  The worst part is that you can never know if there is a problem until you open it up and (try) to watch it, which renders it ineligible for return !!  I'll not be shopping at amazon anymore since you cannot return defective merchandise.
B00005JMCW|4.0|I had the privilege of briefly meeting Jamie Lee Curtis while this movie was opening.  She's a smart, sweet, charming woman who delivers a great performance here.  I think I enjoyed this remake as much as the original with Jodie Foster.  Watch them BOTH and YOU decide!
B004SRPXWQ|4.0|This is a great app its just with a normal kindle fire theres no microphone so tom cant pick up what your saying
B0006PV5VC|5.0|The sound production on both  pieces is remarkable. It is like having the entire orchestra set up in your living room. Stravinsky has influenced many contemporary artist out side of classical, such as Phil Lesh of the Grateful Dead, and in the piece of &#34;Song of the Nightingale&#34; is remarkable in it's scope, clarity, and breadth of imagination at the dawn of the twenty century.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|You don't have to be a great artist to enjoy this game.  In fact, I play with an artist - his drawings are beautiful and intricate while mine are crude and clumsy, but the IDEA gets across.  and that's what makes this game so addictive.  It's more about figuring out WHAT you're going to draw to identify the word than HOW you draw it.  One annoyance is saving up enough tokens to buy more colors.
B00004SVGE|5.0|No pun in tended. This DTS mix is warm and intimate with all the subtitles of the trio and Krall's sultry voice in full display. If you have a surround system and universal player add some 5.1 disc to your collection. You ears will appreciate it..
B00BIVN82M|5.0|Although I love just about any remake he does of the classic crooners and songs, what completely sold me on this release was that he has some of his own songs on this CD.  He's incredibly talented and I am so thankful that he continues to share with us. I also find him to be humble and down to earth, which is an artist I will gladly support.  You cannot go wrong with this CD.  Enjoy
B0074MZSWW|4.0|This is a mood disc and you have to be in the right mood for this one.if you are a fan of roots blues and  Ameircana influenced R & B then this is your disc. I do hope they play more live dates this summer in the east.
B00BQ1DAHC|5.0|This is one of the best Cd's I have listened to in along time.  First heard Cape of our Hero off this cd and knew I had to buy it when it was released.
B00BGIC2J2|1.0|Do not rent or even think about buying this movie. Was extremely long, no plot whatsoever, my husband rolled over and fell asleep after an hour. A huge waste of time and the $4 we paid to rent it through Amazon.
B00019074O|5.0|This movie is a classic and will always be watching whenever I'm looking for a good laugh.  Definitely recommend this movie.
0767836324|5.0|Nothing better than a good old Peter Pan story, with Robin Williams to boot!!!  Love the movie! I think it makes parents think twice about work and raising their kids...kids are so much more important!!
B004X2M9VY|4.0|My child is catching up on the seasons  She really likes this show and tends to watch all day marathons
B000YJ54DU|1.0|I was an avid Jack Reacher fan who bought the books as soon as they came out. This book was the last one I bought. It was that awful. Maybe one day I'll pick up his next book but with nothing to lose Child lost a fan and I lost my money and a favorite series.
B00C2C637I|1.0|Years ago I read \\"Moby Dick\\" for the first time and found it to be one of my most hated books. It took me a while to come to terms with the fact that the book that many consider one of the best ever was so low in my totem pole. When I read this book by Ray Bradbury I had a sense of deja-vu, since I had seen the praise for this book, which many consider one of the masterpieces of the Gothic genre, and I found it completely unreadable.<br /><br />The reasons I did not care for this book are many. First, I could not connect with the two boys that are the main characters (particularly throughout the first half of the story). After reading for a while I could not care less about what was going on with Jim and Will. A big drawback for me was the language and prose. I am all for literary novels, but i could not help feeling that the author was using complicated phrases and language in an effort to show how smart he was. This got old really quick and seriously made it a chore to keep reading. The story was just OK, but given the aforementioned problems, it did not do anything at all for me either.<br /><br />In summary, I am pretty sure that the problem is not so much with the book as with how the book affects me. I am always going to remember it as my second \\"Moby Dick\\", and I can already picture in my mind the bewildered looks I will get when the book comes up in a conversation and I explain my dissatisfaction with it. This is my first time reading Ray Bradbury, but I have decided to read \\"Farenheit 451\\" to find out if my issue is with this specific book or with the author. We will see what that one brings...
B003P2WO5E|4.0|Interesting new series from Sanderson. Not sure when this was first published as I type this from a Kindle. Book did drag a bit in some places and I understand that some of that is necessary to build your back story. Overall good stuff to start the series. Just hope it has the staying power and doesn't run out of gas.
B00COGXGNQ|4.0|I give this moe four stars for its romance, setting and simple story line. Josh Duhamel is believable and plays a solid role as usual. This is the first movie I've seen with Julianne Hough and she is a horrible Actor. She can't even squeeze out tears when telling about why she's on the run. Too bad they couldn't have chosen a decent actress!
B004GHNIRK|5.0|I never did read Les Miz before because it's TOO LONG!!! What a wimp I was. I finally took up the challenge and I'm glad I did. To tell the truth, knowing the musical so well helped me get along through the book when Hugo went on about some interesting bit of history I didn't care about. I decided to keep going and not let the break in the narrative slow me down. What emerges fron the book is an often more human and sympathetic understanding of these characters than the musical can give in its short version. There is just so much more here than I knew about before! For those who have invested emotional energy into the play or the movie, reading the book is a very satisfyng experience indeed.<br /><br />This translation is very readable. It's obvious, at many points, that putting this into English took some word acrobatics of a remarkable nature. Reading the Kindle version was especially satisfying as I could easily look up meanings of difficult words without breaking up my reading experience. I recommend this free book with great enthusiasm!
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|You will be playing this game nonstop for hours on end you will have a hard time stopping highly addictive
B005CRQ4XI|5.0|I am not good with words so my thoughts is simple.I am thankful that in reading this book I felt that I was there in all its hardships it's splendor and it joy. I swear I thought my feet hurt.
B005K17RU0|3.0|So it's raining. Zoom in on my location on the map but clouds cover labels. Should have a range of transparency so I can see more details.  When I m home ok but when traveling I need to see cities and towns labeled.<br /><br />Yes, you gave us lots of info but I liked the graphics on last version better.
B0097K21YW|5.0|~<br />I love it!<br /><br />You don't have to be a gamer to play it.<br /><br />Best of all there's the option of turning the timer off.<br /><br />Since I like to play a few games to relax, NOT TO BE IN COMPETITION this game lets me enjoy this cute green thing.<br /><br />Plus, you don't run out off fire balls &amp; have to start all over, you just keep throwing until you get the buildings, they look good burning.<br /><br />Now I'm wondering how to get the pink one.
B0098G7AWS|5.0|This movie is sad but the best sad movie in the world. My mom always crys and I can hold it in. It is romance movie!
B003FSTN5C|5.0|If you liked NCIS, you'll love this spin off.  The characters are so real that you get to know each one better and better with each season.
B000MRAAJM|5.0|This product came as promised.  Great series that I can watch multiple times. The quality of the picture is so crisp. Thanks BBC team.
B000BC8STM|5.0|This dvd is great, has some of the same footage as Cher live in Las Vegas but a few different songs and narratives
B004E547D8|5.0|Bought for my kids and parents for gifts.  No porn!  Finally an action movie that's not preditable that the whole family can watch.  Can't wait for the next one.
B0053JJLLC|4.0|It was full of science references, moralistic diatribes and a lot of action throughout. Could turn into a great movie too!
B003UYUP58|4.0|A little dry in some areas; otherwise great overview of cancer's heinous existence and our struggle to defeat it.  Must read for residence and new nurses who wish to further understand 'enemy' number one.
B00AB0AR2U|5.0|This was the first resident evil movie I have seen and it was great. Probably just under two hours long and I enjoyed every second of it. Don't want to ruin the ending ;).
B009S8PEHY|3.0|Not really a great album. His choice of songs did not thrill me. I would have picked many others. Some of the choices were fine but overall not my favorite Christmas album. Sorry Rod!
B00BESLHEA|5.0|I liked that it was an action movie with a little bit of oriental vibe to it. The delivery was awesome because it was digital. Bautista was great.
B008Y2IU12|4.0|liked the extra minutes from the original.  I tend to prefer the extended editions just for that.  like the movie a lot, and the take on the dwarfs was far better than the Disney version.
0060989157|4.0|This book is awesome. Even if you aren't a big fan of Motley Crue you still get an in depth look at the personal lives of each &#34;character&#34;. I still have a few chapters but it is a fairly easy read. Shipped quick and was in decent shape.
B000FC11A6|2.0|Too much detail!<br />Some funny stuff but a grind read.<br />Story could use more continuity.<br />Doubt I will read anything else by this writer
B00846REIS|5.0|I Loved this book, can't wait to finish the series! I Told My girlfriends and family it is a must read!
B00A72989U|5.0|This is my first Alicia Keys album and I love it. There isn't a song on here that i don't like, which is rare for me. I highly recommend this to everyone :)
B001HBYHFA|5.0|Bring back firefly! (I know this is a long lost cause that people cling to, because at this point I don't know that it could be brought back. But at least stop suing people for making Jayne's hat... I mean come on people, get serious.)
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|The great season 3 of Downton Abbey continues.  Season 3 is full of changes for both the family and it's servants, as a new modern era has arrived.  Can't wait for Season 4!
B004X6PRO6|5.0|it was sometimes hard to follow but a great book. the pain and suffering wore me out, i think a lot was sadly true.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|I personally always date 'the nice guy's', so I enjoyed this book as a sort of fantasy ' what if?'  Travis is the perfect mix of messed up and sweetheart.
B004DLPXAO|4.0|I'm still learning some of the benefits of the app but I love to read love the fact that it works great with my Kindle to my phone
B004HWYTP4|4.0|While this was not something I would run out and buy, I did really enjoy it.  There was lots of fun and humor in it.  There were a couple of times it was not quite believable but that didn't kill the movie.  It's not real folks, lighten up.<br /><br />Watch it and enjoy.  You'll end with a smile.<br /><br />F
B0070DOHQS|5.0|This app allows to remotely connect to my laptops. Very convenient. I haven't tested all the features yet.  Very easy to setup.
0470474874|4.0|I been using it to brush upon my excel skills. For the price, it offers quite a lot. From basics all the way upto little bit of vba. I been using it little by little for work and its help a lot! Great product for beginners as well. I think the book definitely breaks down to easy to understand languages!

B005LAIHSQ|3.0|Not as good as other SnowWhite movies I have seen. OK to watch but probably wouldnt watch a second time, will resale
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|I love this series and was extremely happy with the final book.  It was a satisfying ending that left me feeling like the series was really over.  I closed the book at the end with no regrets.<br /><br />This book is mostly battle but oh what a battle it is.  From now on every other fantasy series that has a big battle against the ultimate evil is going to seem like the battle was too easy, too simple, and not worthy of the situation.  A Memory of Light has set a new bar for what an epic final battle against evil should be.

B000002UB3|5.0|By the Summer of 1969 the members of The Beatles were in a sad state as a band and having problems with each other as individuals. In the two years since Brian Epstein died they had tried, and failed, to manage their own affairs. Ultimately, it was that failure that led to their break-up, although many other issues contributed to it.<br /><br />Musically they had drifted away from their relationship with George Martin. This meant that although they were writing as well and as creatively as ever (indeed, Harrison was at his peak as a songwriter) translating the raw material into albums suitable for release had become a major problem. The White Album was a sprawling and uneven mixture of great material and lesser works and 'Let It Be', recorded but not yet released, was such a mess that they were desperately trying to find a way to turn it into material worthy of release.<br /><br />It was at this low ebb that McCartney, with the support of the others, asked George Martin to produce a record for them \\"the way we used to\\". Although that was, of course, impossible- they were long past the stage where they could go back to earlier times- Martin was able, with the support of the band, to take their material and turn it into a beautifully produced and cohesive album; not a throwback, but a new venture leading the way for others as The Beatles had done throughout the life of the group. The result was 'Abbey Road'.<br /><br />The album features both songs and a suite of connected themes. It actually works better on CD than on vinyl, because the music builds to a climax and having to turn the record over halfway through destroys the continuity. The songs come first, starting with Lennon's atmospheric 'Come Together', with its hiss and the wonderful bass line from McCartney. The lyrics sound rather self-conscious; Lennon had already explored nonsense imagery in 'I Am The Walrus' and this variation on the same theme doesn't have the same impact, but the power of the music and the palpable mystique of the setting make this a memorable song.<br /><br />Harrison has two of his greatest songs on this album, of which the ballad 'Something' is the first. An exquisite love song with a wonderful languid guitar solo, it ranks with the very best songs of the late 1960s. It has been covered many times by all manner of singers- the signature of a truly great work.<br /><br />Alas, it is followed by what, in my view, is the one jarring note on 'Abbey Road', McCartney's 'Maxwell's Silver Hammer'. Musically, it is a bit twee but quite catchy. The problem is that McCartney, having had success with unlikely subjects in songs like 'When I'm 64' and 'Lovely Rita', decided that it would be fun to write a jokey song about a serial killer. It's unfortunate that by then Lennon and McCartney had drifted so far apart that Lennon wasn't able, or for that matter inclined, to tell Paul that he should ditch this and bring a more substantial song to the table. The album cries out for a 'Penny Lane' or 'Back In The USSR' to elevate Paul's contribution to the individual songs.<br /><br />Paul does redeem himself somewhat with 'Oh, Darling', a slow tempo bluesy number with Paul giving it his best raspy rock vocal. John, who was painfully transparent at times, thought he should have sung it instead of Paul- in other words, he thought it was a great song!<br /><br />Ringo's 'Octopus's Garden' follows. There was room for one simple little song on the album and this is it. For some reason people are always comparing OG to 'Yellow Submarine', presumably because both were sung by Ringo and both have an underwater theme, but musically they are nothing like each other. Although Ringo is given full composing credit, there's no doubt that George contributed a lot to the song and it's a cute little ballad, with a very good bass line.<br /><br />It's followed by John at his most progressive and obscure with 'I Want You (She's So Heavy)', which is one of the few songs with almost allthe lyrics in the title. It's really an experiment in noise and a good opportunity to take a bathroom break without actually missing anything, since it will sound exactly the same by the time you get back. Not my favorite track (I prefer songs that go somewhere) but interesting nonetheless.<br /><br />On vinyl that's the end of side 1, but on CD we go straight into George's other great song, 'Here Comes The Sun'. Catchy and positive, this song lifts the album into a state of optimisim and lightness that lasts the rest of the way. The next track is one of the most beautiful pieces of singing recorded by The Beatles, the 3-part, triple-tracked 'Because'. This ethereal sound reminds me of Schubert's 'Ave Maria', peaceful and angelic.<br /><br />It leads in to the suite, or medley. This is an interconnected set of songs, some of greater length than others, but all lasting more than a minute, so far more than just unfinished snatches. Mainly put together by Martin and McCartney, though featuring several Lennon contributions, there is a very classical feel to this music, with a recapitulation and development of the themes into a stunning climax. On the way, there's a Ringo drum solo, an exchange of riffs and a quick run-through of styles from rock to ballads to chorus singing, with the final line being one of the most famous in Beatle history- 'And in the end the love you take is equal to the love you make'. Nothing could be more simple or more profound- a fitting climax to the amazing career of The Beatles.<br /><br />Back in the day, a night at British movie theaters ended with the national anthem. The Beatles include their own little anthem here- just a footnote to let us know the show has ended, this time forever. We often discuss what might have been had The Beatles not broken up, or had they ever got together again. My own view is that they did everything they could in the period they were together. 'Abbey Road' was indeed the end; the end of the 1960s and the endof the band which transformed popular music. The Beatles truly were unique and the love they made is still with us today.
B000V6U6XE|5.0|This is a surprisingly good collaboration. If you like Elvis as a troubadour as much as a troublemaker, you'll love this. He sings with unequalled passion, especially desperation and longing. And the melodies are exquisite.

B00003CX8U|4.0|Bottom Line First:<br />All that Jazz can be an intense and difficult to watch. This is a rewarding movie for a thinking viewer. It is not recommend for date night, light entertainment. It is not entirely family friendly as there can be rough language and exposed flesh. There are views of actual open heart surgery. All That Jazz is a dramatic exposure of a person's inner life as he forces himself to see past his own weaknesses. Along the way there is great dancing, moments of satire, love of family and love of the flesh. If you are open to a serious and complex movie I recommend All That Jazz.<br /><br />Director, choreographer and writer Bob Fosse invites you to watch this as a film autobiography. Roy Scheider who performs the Fosse role as Joe Gideon reemphasizes this approach in the commentaries attached to this copy. Many who knew Fosse reacted to this view of the movie commenting with equal passion that Bob Fosse was not that bad of a person and that he was worse.<br /><br />This is fiction. Fosse used elements from his life to create a fictional world. Joe Gideon is not (exactly) Fosse. Gideon is an exaggeration of those elements, good and bad that make for a dramatic movie. I take this stand against the counter argument that no autobiography is an exact retelling of the writer's life, because the writer is never able to remove himself from the retelling. Fosse makes the deliberate decision to pick and choose because fiction allows/Demands that he change reality to fit the demands of his story.<br /><br />Joe Gideon is a man slaved to the classic addictions: booze, drugs, sex and work. Against the claims of all these `unreal' aspects of being a person he will sacrifice every real value:  His real love of his daughter, his abiding love for his ex-wife and the burgeoning love for his girlfriend. He is deeply committed to the production of Broadway musical comedy and his next movie. All that is real in Joe Gideon is on view and available for his customers, those who care most about him get what is left.<br /><br />As the movie open we can see that what is left is dwindling. We are here to watch this man die. We are invited to judge him. We see him from the view of his business partners, fellow performers, and loved ones. We will watch him judge himself before death. Rather the Angel of Death played, rather perfectly underplayed by Jessica Lange. Death clearly does not judge, and is never fooled. She is everyone's ultimate lover and is beyond caring about anyone's artifices, dodges or self-delusions.<br /><br />Director Fosse refuses to blink or excuse Joe's failures. It is this honesty that can make this movie difficult to watch. If you can see this much into another man's life and not ask yourself to see past your own excuses, then watch All that Jazz again. You may be razzled dazzed by the sex and dancing and all that jazz, but ultimately Fosse asks that you see your truth.who care most about him get what is left.<br /><br />As the movie open we can see that what is left is dwindling.

B00BSBUZPK|4.0|Surprisingly frank remembrances and testimonials - the music, the makers, the excess, the stress. In the long run - despite ups and downs, in's and outs, the music survives - thanks to superb craftsmanship of songwriting, production, and on-stage delivery. Wish we had the full concert on the third disc, one wonders what was left off.
B0049VZ222|5.0|I've never liked Zombie movies before, but I love these zombies to the max!  Wow I just can't get enough of this series.  It is intelligent and makes it all pretty believable.  It's the people behind all of this.  The GOOG the BAD and of course the absolute Ugliest people (not talking about the living dead here I'm talking about the ones who are alive.)  The writers of this show most definitely deserve an Emmy for their writing of this season and onward!
B00B23O96A|3.0|It's just like being at home with 'ol Eric, sitting around the porch, watching the change of seasons, having some tea, and playing some good old songs.  Pleasant listen - relaxing, easy listening music for the boomers. Take it with the spirit with which it is offered - old friends coming over to chill and noodle around. Don't come in here thinking it's still 1967 (or even 1977 or 1987) - it's not, and we're not. Worth buying if you are an Eric fan and/or in a mellow mood; not worth buying if you want some excitement (or the best from Old Slowhand's extensive catalogue). A pleasant diversion.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|then you must b e contemplating buying this season.  I strongly recommend you get seasons one and two as well.  Watch it from Season 1, Episode 1, then go through each and every episode thereafter.  I'm sure you coul;d just jump in at a certain point but it isn't going to playh as well in your head than if you watched them all.  Now I can 't wait until Season 4 begins!
B009NY43NY|1.0|So, so, sooo disappointing!<br /><br />Several times, I've attempted to write this review, but I just have no words, and honestly it all been said - and said quite well, by the other devoted followers of this series that were as stunned as I. The joke is definitely on us.<br /><br />As her defense, when faced with criticism, the arrogant Ms. Harris claims she needed to be true to herself and her characters. Ironically, she failed miserably on both counts. Although the ending she penned may have indeed been what she envisioned at the start of the series, over the years, as the story developed, and the characters took on a life of their own, even a 5th grader could see it no longer fit.<br /><br />And to those misguided loyalists who claim the negative reviews are merely readers pouting that Sookie did not end up with *******, let me wholeheartedly assure them that this is not my only issue.  The plot grossly lacks continuity, all of the characters are one-dimensional, often in total opposition to their previous selves, and the entire storyline is painfully contrived.  Mostly, however, this novel totally lacks emotion, and when Sookie and her HEA finally get together for their love scene, it's so lackluster and boring, I actually skimmed over it.<br /><br />This was one of the worst books I have read in probably the last ten years, and certainly THE worst finale to a series I have EVER read. I can't help but question the readers who rated this book with 4 and 5 star reviews.

B002UM5BXW|4.0|I like the fact Anthony Bourdain does not sugar coat the restaurant business.  He tells it like it is: the good, the bad and the ugly.  I find his writing entertaining, informative and seductive.  I read Medium Raw which led me to go back in his writing career and start at the beginning.  I lived in New York for 22 years and visited Les Halles many times, not knowing who was behind the scenes.  I never had a bad meal and it delivered what I expected.  I would recommend this book to anyone who is a foodie, doesn't mind grahpic language and wants a good read.

B002M5E2DW|4.0|I first read this book six years ago while at a cross road in my life. I lived on the Big Island of Hawaii and my husband had moved back to the main land 3 months prior leaving me not knowing what path to take. Stay in Hawaii with my family or move with my husband and make our marriage work. I started reading this book with no expectation, and wow, what a life changer. I practiced all the things talked about in this book.  Visualization, gratitude ect. I also used it for weight loss. In three months I had lost 50lbs. I went from a size 12 (170lbs) to a size 4 (115lbs). I'm 5'2 so you can imagine I was quite a bit over weight at 170lbs!<br /><br />Back to the original crisis, to move, or not to move? That was the question. With all this new found positivity my husband and I had been working things out and after 3 months of practicing the Secret I was ready to move, one problem. I needed to sell my car. You can imagine how difficult it is to sell something on an Island! (There are only so many ppl)  I visualized the transaction of selling my car taking place at a restaurant a few blocks from my house with vivid detail.  Also the timing of the sale was critical. I needed a car right up until the day I was to move.  Two weeks before takeoff, I was rear ended (no one was hurt) right in front of the restaurant I had visualized this sale to take place. Obviously I had a `For Sale' sign in the window and immediately the guy that hit me wrote me a check for exactly my asking price. He didn't want to use his insurance and had no use for the car so he told me to keep it. When I told him I was moving and had no use for it either he told me to drive it until I was ready to leave and he would come pick it up. If that's not a good example of the powers of the Secret, I don't know what is. READ THIS BOOK, it will change your life if your open to it.

B000DZC18Q|5.0|Easton Press has numerous variations of this title. The 1968 copyrighted special edition was part of the Limited Edition and I believe Famous Editions. I consider it to be the best of the available editions as the rest are rather generic covers designed for an Ernest Hemingway series.<br /><br />This edition contains illustrations and an introduction by Sinclair Lewis.<br /><br />This was my introduction to Hemingway, and perhaps not the best book to be weaned on. I can understand why kids hate him. His writing is \\"real time.\\" Characters are developed at a snails pace through conversation and deeds. Hemingway seems to write about every waking hour of the main character Robert Jordon. Jordon is an American helping the Spanish in their fight against fascism. The Abraham Lincoln Brigade was a famous group of American communists and various left wingers who went to the aid of the Spanish people. Their experience proved invaluable as they were recruited to act as spies for the OSS during WWII. After WWII, for their dedicated service they were barred from the CIA because they were communists.<br /><br />This story likewise looks at patriotism, communism, democracy, and fascism seen at the microcosm level of Robert Jordan. It is a tale about love and loyalty as Robert meets Maria and plans to make her an honest woman when it is all over. The beginning of the book opens with plans to blow up a strategic bridge, which happens about 400 pages later. The action is slow. Hemingway writing shifts between first and third person. He has sentences without verbs. The book is lengthy and needs an editor by today's standards.<br /><br />I don't know if this is how Hemingway wrote the book, but in this edition it uses the phrase \\"curse word\\" when a curse word should be used. It got annoying after a while. Meanwhile this edition includes an illustration of a topless woman.<br /><br />This is a fine looking EP edition to put on your shelf. I don't expect you to read it.

B00005JLKB|5.0|I absolutely love this show. Watching Superman from his days in high school in this season made this a great way to start the series off. When I heard about this show, I wanted to see where and how Clark Kent/Superman got his start after he landed on Earth from Krypton. With characters such as Clark's best friends Chloe Sullivan and Pete Ross, his high-school sweetheart Lana Lang, his future enemy Lex Luthor and Lex's father Lionel Luthor, I was given the beginning of Superman that I wanted to see. This is the first in a series of 10 seasons that tells an awesome story of Superman in his younger days as a teenager who tries to figure out the secrets of his homeworld of Krypton with great action, touching moments and an amazing perspective.
B001FO7JTA|5.0|Remove anything goes, rock n roll dream and the rest are winners. Brian Johnson sounds great and Angus plays tastefully on this album. The songs are good and the production is well done also. I truly hope they can follow this one up with another good album to further help us forget all the bad ones since for those about to rock. When they try hard ac/dc are blues based rockers without compare as evidenced by the highest selling album by a band of all time, Back in Black.

0385536828|3.0|Well-written as usual for this author, but I have to say that I am so tired of this oh-so-clever twist ending, in which you find out at the end of the book that you have actually been reading a book that has been written by one of the characters in the book you have just read.  Not again, please!  Beyond that problem, I found that I did not really care about the characters.  It seemed like a cold unemotional book to me.
B008Y1YK0I|2.0|Blu-Ray Video: Easily 5 out of 5. The cinematography on display in this film is arguably the finest you will ever see in a major motion picture. The visuals blew me away. I had the privilege, and I do mean privilege of seeing this on a 160\\" projected image in glorious HD thanks to a friend that recently purchased the new BenQ W1070 HD Video projector from Amazon for only $999. Cinephiles should take notice. This projector is a must have for film lovers if you have the space for a large screen.<br /><br /> Audio: 3 ½ out of 5. In the restoration process, I'm sure this was the best they could do. My frustration with the films audio had to do with how out of balance the volume level of the score was with the dialog on screen. I would have to turn down the music it was so loud and then turn it back up again to hear clearly what people were saying. Other than that it was an impressive mix for a 50 year old film.<br /><br /> The Film: 2 out of 5. Let me explain. I have grown up with a love for film watching classics like It's a Wonderful Life, The Great Escape, The Bridge on the River Kwai, The Ten Commandments, and more modern classics like Dances with Wolves, and the Shawshank Redemption to name but a few. While I can enjoy a check your brain at the door film; I really appreciate great storytelling more than anything else. Special effects and explosion never make up for poor writing. This was the biggest and most critically acclaimed Hollywood classic that I had never watched. I had avoided it on home video and TV largely due to the fact that I knew from reading about the film that it deserved to be seen in a large screen format. Period! Not a 30\\" TV or even a more modern 60\\" big screen HDTV. It was shot on Super 70mm for a very large IMAX like format to be viewed on. Having recently purchased my own HD video projector I jumped at the chance to pick this up on Blu from Amazon for only $9.99. My screen at home is 92\\" which is great, but still doesn't begin to do this film justice. So when I had the chance to finally view my copy on my friends' 160\\" screen I jumped at the opportunity!<br /><br /> The performances in this film are excellent. The cast is truly stellar with some of the most recognizable names of that era on display. I really enjoyed David Leans' \\"Bridge on the River Kwai.\\" However, I have never watched a more loved and critically acclaimed film that left me more disappointed than this one did. If I could use one word to describe \\"Lawrence of Arabia\\" it's this. BLOATED. Never has a critically acclaimed award winning film been in greater need of an editor with some authority than this one. I felt sorry for my wife and her friend that I talked into watching this film with me. I can appreciate a deliberately slow film that is building up to something when the pay off is worth it. In this case it wasn't. This film should have been 2 1/2hrs to 3 hours at the most. 4 hours was nothing more than self indulgence by a director that had enough clout to get away with it. I have wanted to watch Doctor Zhivago for some time, but I am very leery of it at this point after what I just went through with \\"Lawrence of Arabia.\\" I probably still will, but I'm in no hurry at this point. The film was so slow that when exciting things did happen; they didn't really excite me or the people I was viewing it with. While I don't regret having watched it; I am deeply disappointed and have no plans to ever give 4 hours of my life to it again. Had I not been watching it on a massive screen; I would have been fast forwarding through parts of it due to boredom. I know I won't change anyone's mind about the film that already loves it, but I needed to vent after giving it four hours of my life that I will never get back. I appreciate the history of the story and think it's clearly a story that should be told on film, but it left me utterly cold.

B008Q09K2U|2.0|Loved \\"The Lion's Game\\"- action from the start and it didn't let up.  \\"The panther\\" was a whole lot tamer. Seemed like twice the dialogue for about a quarter of the action (is that cos John Corey's married now?!?).  And a similar conclusion to another Demille book to boot.  I know Nelson can do a lot better :)
B000YDG66U|5.0|producto excelente
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Great pass the time game, enjoy it<br />, Fun works great and fun to see how long you can stay playing
B00AFROVQC|1.0|What an idiot I was for buying all 4 at the same time.  I have never read anything so childishly written, with such trite phrases and all 4 books were the same.  Each book was really just like an extended chapter of the previous book.  Why am I even wasting my time reviewing this - just rubbish.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I read this book in two days - it had me hooked within the first chapter. The author does a big build up which some felt is slow moving but for me it helped me invest into the characters so when they were feeling happiness, sadness, and pain - you will feel it too. I thoroughly enjoyed the plot of the story and love the characters. Th only thing i felt was off was the fact that they were HS seniors. Throughout the book, I kept thinking they had the emotional maturity of those in their early - mid 20's. I was able to get past that and just enjoy the story for how it unfolded.
B003ODIZL6|3.0|Great app I was a little confuse on what I was doing. But I figure it out awesome app.. recommend
193700788X|2.0|****spoilers In This Review****<br /><br />Overall, this book is a 2.<br /><br />It's not a stand alone book, but in fairness I would not hold CH to that standard in the final book of a 13 book series. That said, this book is the oddball of the group. The first 9 chapters are the most disjointed, with the unknown narrator pov lending a rushed and detached quality to the book. After chapter 9, the book assumes some of the pace and action reminiscent from her earlier works, but sadly, the motives and mystery are thin and rushed. In an effort to include many character favorites, it seems that like a salad, CH just tossed them in with a low calorie dressing.<br /><br />For those who didn't give much thought to Sookie's sense of Christian morality (God help you) you will in DEA. There is a message being preached throughout the entire book and its not subtle. This reader was not prepared for the sermons. I far prefer the generic golden rule and its universality.<br /><br />Rules of her world building are broken or changed in an effort to explain past actions, but the logic is not thought through. Here are three notable bang-head-against-wall examples:<br />1) Sookie always wanted to come first and she knows with a vampire there will always be Maker compulsion; with a Were there is always the Pac waiting to turn her life upside down. Well, apparently Sam has Maenad compulsion and must come if called. Where is the difference here?<br />2) Sookie never wanted to be with Eric through the use of magic and had two opportunities to take that route. In using the CD for Sam, Sookie thinks it has had some effect on both of them and is fine giving it only a passing thought. So that's no longer a big deal?<br />3) There are countless examples of vampires going back on their promises and contracts. There is no assurance, and no reason to believe FDC will honor his word to leave Sookie alone. So Sookie is still unsafe.<br /><br />As for messages of tolerance and love wins, don't look to DEA. The message ends up being separate but equal and sometimes love is not enough.<br /><br />And finally, far from ending DEA with Sookie's future course well defined and happy, CH leaves it to the readers off-page imagination. This \\"maybe ending\\" for a final book is cowardly. And even so, \\"maybe\\" would have been fine had there been any real build-up to Sam. Somewhere around page 300 they have 3 paragraphs of sex. We are Told (not shown) that it was great. That will feel like a rip-off to those readers that were open to Sam.<br /><br />Really, you just don't feel great about where most of the characters land at the end of DEA. The humans and mostly humans (with souls) seem to fare the best. As I guess it should be in a separate but equal world, where there are just some bridges too wide to cross<br /><br />Maybe the only real positive is at the end when Sookie knows if things don't work out with Sam she will be ok. That's great and empowering (which I have always wanted for her), but it sure doesn't sound like a thought that should hit you at the same time you are thinking you \\"might\\" be with your HEA forever.<br /><br />I hope CH really did try her best to get Sookie and her readers to a good place, but I wouldn't bet on it. Based on at least 6 others in the series, I know for a fact she could have done far better than this effort. She could have written this exact storyline and ending with care, detail, consistency and last but not least--some heart.o DEA.

B00821OX98|5.0|the best show i've seen in a long time<br />you have to watch this with popcorn and be ready to be entertained
193700788X|4.0|I've been an avid Sookie fan, as so many are, from book 1.  While it may not have been MY ideal ending, I completely understand why Sookie couldn't end up with my chosen mate for her.  I'm not disappointed in the ending because I feel it's actually what's best for all involved.  As in life, sometimes the right thing isn't always the easiest choice!!<br /><br />Don't trust everyone with their negative reviews and their \\"no\\" votes to the positive reviews.  Read the book for yourself and then decide.  I'm just as disappointed to see the series end as everyone else, but I'm not going to bash the author for not continuing it.  Instead, I applaud her for keeping it going for as long as she has.
B004GHNIRK|3.0|I would like this because I received at the time. In addition, I so happy with this book. Thank you so much.

B005723JSQ|4.0|I absolutely love S. Kinsella. I kind of figured the end, but I enjoyed it. I always feel like I am right there with her characters.
B00AGKHALQ|5.0|This is a great 3 DVD set of all (as far as I know) Rammstein videos.  I might take off 1/2 star, if I could, because the labeling on DVD 1 and 2 are reversed,so the videos on DVD1 are the songs listed as being on DVD2 and vice versa.  I even managed to enjoy the \\"Making of...\\" which I usually don't bother with, but they did have subtitles.  You will, however, have to plan watching all of them when you have about 4 1/2 hours of free time.  If you already have \\"Lichtspielhaus\\", then you can skip the first DVD and first 2 songs on DVD2,unless you just want to watch \\"The Making of...\\".  It also comes with a very good photo-booklet.
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|This is a REALLY great game it brings back old times of sitting on the coach playing Iron Man on the old ps2

B0019LZV4E|1.0|No, despite Sondheim's ambition, this offering of empty calories will never make it to a gourmet menu. A humble barber loses his pretty partner and daughter. He seeks revenge on the world with a low-life malheureuse. The serial killing and cannibalism that follow seem emotionally out of place. You never feel Todd's motivation is authentic. His suffering is not really on the level of Job, Spartacus, Karl Childers or even the Count of Monte Cristo. Unfortunately, like all of Sondheim, the emotional context here is about as authentic as one of the whinier episodes of Love American Style. The music is derivative and not really good, though the creator no doubt considered it to be ground-breaking. Rejected by his mom, Sondheim went after big-time approval from critics and audiences. The Former he usually gets from the parochial Miss Daisys of the New York Times. But the theaters staging his works usually end up empty. No one considers Sondheim a legend as much as Sondheim. When Follies was revived last year on Broadway, I overheard a priceless sales pitch on the half-price tickets line. The officious hawker was trying to convince a tourist to see it with the following guarded praise: \\"It's really great, well anyway it's like a museum piece...well, in any case, the performances are certainly worth seeing.\\" And I said \\"save your money and look for a real museum piece in a museum. You're too late for the real Follies, which at least had spectacle in their favor.\\" Sweeney avoids the endless kvetch-fest of Follies, but not a note of it rings true. Just one example to illustrate how emotion is just wallpaper to Sondheim: how on earth does Mrs. Lovett end up singing \\"Not While I'm Around\\"? Schizophrenia? For it is the only thing of its kind in the whole show, so you can't believe it. Bizarre. That being said, the acting here is fine, even Sacha Cohen as the macassared mountebank . Too bad the actors had such mediocre material to work with.<br />An interesting Sondheim anecdote:I was at the Met for a brilliant performance of an opera about another ne'er-do-well. I can't besmirch the composer by stating his name in the context of this debacle. Suffice it to say, the character he created, unlike Sondheim's, is richly ambiguous, not a stereotype, with interesting motivation and ingenious music. Sondheim was in the first row and at the curtain got up and scurried out without applauding in the midst of tumultuous appluse. Jealous much? My advice: write a musical about a Broadway songsmith with towering ambition and puny talent. That's a story I'd believe and I think this time he'd get it right.
B001EBWING|5.0|Seen it three dozen times. I marvel at how good it is, given the process that went into the writing the script.
B00127RAJY|5.0|the video after so many views can get boring, but if you're just starting out and need some guidance I think this is great.
B008602KQI|1.0|Loved the books and tried to watch the movie; the videography is almost as bad as \\"Jason Bourne\\" with constant camera shake. Maybe it gets better after the first 20 minutes but by that time I was feeling too nauseous already.
B00CDT41RY|5.0|A lot of inflammatory language but considering the time frame of the movie it was probably accurate.  It kept us entertained.
B0087ITBPC|5.0|Not since \\"The Prince of Tides\\" (one of Ms. Streisand's greatest films) has Barbra done such a great job with a role.  Her comedic timing with Seth Rogen is impeccable, and everyone should own a copy of this Blu ray / dvd.  One of the best actresses of our time.  Laughter, tears...this movie has it all.  Amazing, funny, and poignant.
B00826B65M|5.0|When I decided to read all or most of the Human Comedy in both English and French I thought that I would download each volume separately via the Gutenberg Project or other sites that deal with classics which are no longer subject to copyright laws and therefore do not charge for downloading.  By chance I saw that both the French and the English versions of the complete works were available at Amazon for a minimal price.  I was willing to pay a small price for something that I could have got for free in the hope that the typos and poor page layout that plague the free downloads would not be found in the Amazon version.  To my great pleasure I found that my hopes were not disappointed.  The typeface is clear and the typos, that abound in the free version, are absent. Amazon even made some corrections and notified me to reload the new version. I have been very pleased with both the English and French versions.  It was certainly worth the money.  I am reading the books using my Kindle Paperwhite.  I toggle between the two languages, use the French dictionary and the automatic link to word translation and to Wikipedia. My only complaint is that for a vocabulary such as Balzac uses the translation options are very poor - a link to a site such as WordReference or Google translate would offer more suggestions for the translation.
B00COGZ8FU|4.0|Jack Reacher<br />130 min<br />Action/Crime/Thriller<br />December 21, 2012<br />USA<br />Director: Christopher McQuarrie<br />Writers: Christopher McQuarrie -screenplay, Lee Child<br />Stars: Tom Cruise, Rosamund Pike, Richard Jenkins, and Robert Duvall<br /><br />Over the years I have read many novels.  Several I have seen the movies, and the characters were usually quite different from those cast to play the parts.  I know it can be disappointing if your an avid book enthusiast, but keep in mind what the movie makers must overcome to cast a movie.  Can they find an actor/actress that looks like the book character, and can that person act their way out of a paper bag? Will they do the novel justice with the screen play and acting?  Unfortunately book purest are rarely satisfied and may not even be willing to see the movie.  In this case, it's their loss.  When Tom Cruise started his career he may have been almost a pretty boy, but even then he could act his way out of a paper bag and then some.  He has always been able to take a character and make them flesh and blood.  So hence why I never miss seeing a Tom Cruise movie.  Cruise makes Jack Reacher believable, and someone you want on your side when the chips are down.  He may not look like the book character, but he \\"is\\" the movie character.  To me he made a retired military cop real, and the supporting cast were great too.  Even the short time Robert Duvall was given on screen, he made his part unforgettable.  That's what good actors and actresses do.<br /><br />On a sunny day a sniper kills five people while they walk along side a river.  An ex-military sniper is taken into custody shortly after and will only say, \\"Get Jack Reacher\\".  Who is Jack Reacher?  A retired Army officer that has been off the grid for two years.  Out of the blue Jack Reacher walks in and says he is no friend of the sniper, and that he is there to bury him.  But when the sniper's attorney convinces Jack to look deeper.  Jack finds the case against the sniper is wrapped, tied with a bow, and just too plain neat for him to believe.  His suspicions are now aroused and if there was any doubt, someone is trying to stop his investigation by any means necessary including a frame up for a murder.  One of the reasons this movie is so great is the bad guys have some real depth to them along with being cold blooded their boss is scary.  If you're in the mood for a great crime thriller, I highly recommend you at least rent this one.  After seeing it I know I will want to revisit regularly, so I ended up buying it to add to my library.  I bought the Blu-ray and the picture and sound quality are excellent.  Beautiful camera work throughout is good reason alone, but there are many scenes that the added quality make it worth buying.  This is well worth adding to your video library.  Tom Cruise was so good in this part my hope is they will bring more of the books to the screen with him as Jack.<br /><br />Recommendations: [[ASIN:B000I9X9HY The Presidio]], [[ASIN:B000SLP4SE Shooter]], [[ASIN:0780621603 Most Wanted]], [[ASIN:0792159659 The General's Daughter]], and [[ASIN:B001VLXQSU The Jackal]].<br /><br />CA Lustere against the sniper is wrapped, tied with a bow, and just too plain neat for him to believe.

B007FC3AAI|5.0|Great movie!! Great quality!! Fast Shipping too.... I enjoyed all of the movies released, if you can buy a pack of all of them, go ahead!
B009NY43NY|2.0|It was nice to revist with all the old characters,but other than that it seemed to be written by somebody other than this author.It had a completely different style and the dialog was so different that in many parts Sookie didn't seem to be Sookie. Where was the rapport with Pam? Or the friendship of BIll? Or Eric's sense of humor? Where was Sam/Dean? After so many books, I can understand a thin plot, but I don't understand the abandonment of the characters' personality traits. This was not worth buying even just to round out the collection.
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|This long series has finally come to a fitting end. Much more war talk than I personally prefer but it was about the Last Battle so it was necessary. My one wish would be for an epilogue, just to peek in at the survivors and see more of their ending.
B004DLPXAO|1.0|Used to be a great app! I liked getting the manga that only came out in digital format and read on my phone, loved it! But now ever since I let it update it shows up the manga pages two at a time on the screen, one above the other. Each page is only about an inch wide and 1.5 inches tall. Like I can read that! Having to touch and zoom in each page just isn't worth it. And also like everyone else has said it now takes up about 30 MB. 30 Mb wasted because now I can't even read my manga. Uninstalling. Thank God I still have the older version on my tablet. This is very disappointing. WTF Amazon?<br /><br />Unless anyone else with this problem has figured out a setting or something to fix it? (If so, please let me know) I can't seem to find a way to change it.
B008YRTWM8|5.0|Great movie. Lots of meaning about life, its struggles and the troubles that can come with success. Highly recommend this film
B0073QWCAA|5.0|These Blu-rays came quickly and the movies really clean up better than I would have imagined considering how old the first two are.  If you like the Series I highly recommend this Box Set.

B007ZXK08C|5.0|Loved this book! Couldn't stop reading, its a big page turner! The ending did disappoint but brilliant storyline, great characters and very well written. Flynn's best book by far.
B00785P2QC|5.0|this game rocks. its fun and easy and is awesome.if you don't have the game you should get it because it rocks
B00AQ3K8IU|2.0|Bought this book as it kept popping up in the best sellers list and had lots of positive reviews. Cannot understand the hype! Dull, slow moving pointless story! Gets good (well, readable!) half way through when her past is revealed but would not recommend at all. I have no interest in romantic novels so should have listened to my instinct and stayed away from this!
B00992CF6W|5.0|well first some lags but amazing cause you can play with your friends on 6,1 and make sure you see me from sky
B002U3CCKQ|4.0|Read this after Gone Girl and enjoyed it. Flynn's style is predictable though. Interesting characters and worth the read but a far cry from Gone Girl.
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|Not my normal reading material but it held my interest all the way through.  The ending was good with suspense right to the end.
B002U3CCF6|3.0|The poorest of Flynn's three books but still a good read. Slow moving and not really a page turner. Very predictable. Gone Girl definitely her best by far.
B00BBI9WD6|5.0|I think I have now read each of the Honor books twice, but I enjoy and appreciate them even more on the third time through.  The detail of plot, the details of engineering, and most of all the development in characters both central and peripheral can be savored even more with perspective.  I first read the books to share them with my middle school daughter.  She, now almost thirty, is in her second time through the series as her professional commitments give her time.  She has her best reading in front of her.
B00BHHIWQO|4.0|this is fun and fast....something I can spend as much or as little time that I have.  I find it challenging and addicting.  I would highly recommend this game!

Raw food vs cooked food was supported by Kouchakoff theory of digestive leucocytosis, only available in french but free as is the other book from Howell :)
B00BT0ZDF2|4.0|The movie was confusing at first but I was able to follow along and it was a great movie for the money.
B000OZ0NXA|2.0|Boring books. Don Pendeltons Mack Bolan a.k.a. The Executioner series is much better, more action and the Mack Bolan series has been around much longer. I think I'll stick with them.

B009NY43NY|5.0|Book was great! I loved the ending but it is sad that it is the last one. I will miss Sookie!!!

B00CEIGYAG|5.0|I'm in danger of over playing this one.  I've had it on repeat for a week now.  Just found out my roommate bought the same song and has been playing it non stop as well.  I'm excited for the new album.

B00CL68QVQ|5.0|very good work of the main characters, super interesting, and showing the way some people live their life..not usually expressed in these kinds of movies.
B0018BB21G|5.0|great 60's album.<br />essential for all students of psychedlic music and hippy trippy stuff!<br />you wont be disappointed with this groovy little artefact
B0085A9HXS|5.0|Very good action, from the beginning till end.<br />A must see by everyone.<br />Everything went ok with buying the  product.
B0040QDMBE|5.0|Well written, concise style. Comparisons are occasionally questionable (like comparing very small economies like Sweden with much larger ones like Germany or the US), but many excellent points are made.<br /><br />That doesn't mean anyone needs to agree with the author's position but that would be beside the point - the book highlights a well-though out counter-balance to die-hard free market neoliberalism, which - the author argues - has failed very visibly in 2008 and policymakers seem to have not taken that lesson to heart.
B000005HFH|5.0|excellent collection of Chet Baker classics. A great CD. I recommend this one to all jazz lovers and Chet Baker fans
B00ATDOVNK|4.0|I really enjoy hidden object games and this is a good one. I honestly wasn't expecting much. But I was pleasantly surprised. The graphics are great and the storyline engaging. I don't usually buy games buy I made an exception for this one. I find it relaxing....I can move along at my own pace.
B00AFROVQC|1.0|I agree with Charles Stoffer -- this book is quite childishly written. I, too, noticed the use of the same descriptive adjective in consecutive sentences, the misuse of sound-alike words (site instead of sight is one of her most common ones), poor grammar, etc. I suspect the use of Dragon Naturally or some other dictation software, which should never be used without the text being edited by a human afterwards.<br /><br />Furthermore, elements of the plot feel like they were lifted directly from 'Game of Thrones', albeit dumbed way down. How old was the author when she wrote this? It reads like it was written by a middle-schooler. If it was written by an adult then I suspect she's making the mistake of talking down to her intended audience. That is not how JK Rowling and other noted authors of books intended for an adolescent audience write.<br /><br />With a really thorough editing, 'A Quest of Heroes' might be ready for publication, but it isn't yet.
B0047Y17P2|5.0|Real page turner. Hard to put it down. You will really enjoy this one.  Don't miss your opportunity for a terrific read.
B008A1B5Z0|5.0|This \\"Smart RAM Booster Pro\\", is a really good utility app for my tablet. To make it simple, this is a \\"App Killer and Cache Cleaner\\" one thing i have learned about tablets is, when you close an app, it may/usually not close and keeps running in the background using valuable resources and draining the battery, you may not know this if you are (like me) new to tablets, but you will soon learn this fact and that is where this utility app comes in. Now, tablet veterans are saying, just go into settings and kill the app and clean the cache (one by one), (yes you can do that) but why when Smart Ram Booster Pro can place one tiny none intrusive little gauge (shows Free/used ram) at the top middle of your tablet screen and when you close an app/apps just tap the tiny gauge and it will kill the app/apps you have running in the background for you and it shows you how many apps are closed and a little more info for a few seconds on your screen. This app is also programmable to your liking and has different levels for killing apps and cleans all of the caches of all apps at one time. Best of all it is a free utility app and 95% of all the reviews are totally positive. Just think if you are playing a game or doing really important work on your tablet and suddenly things start to slow down really bad, well, just tap that tiny gauge and (WOW) everything is back to normal. Great app for your tablet and i do recommend this. It works for me and many others.  Thanks
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|I like to 'feed' the machines, nothing is better than hearing that coin drop in. I only wish the coins regenerated quicker.
B00CDV6WDS|5.0|I love \\"Mahjong\\", it can be addictive and so much fun. It is really simple to play, just place one matching tile over the other matching tile until you clear the board, just simple and fun. Also this does not need a lot of your Tablet resources to run, but it looks really good on your screen. There is a really large amount of Mahjong variations to play and it is a very good way to pass the time, if your waiting at an appointment, you can play this on your tablet while offline also. I recommend this game for the whole family.<br />Thanks
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|Allow's one to get out the built up aggression. Also easy, yet fun and a teaching tool for kids. Hand eye coordination.
B0018QXL1K|5.0|I have always loved many of the songs on this album. This is a replacement for a scratched cd I had.
B004MC8CA2|4.0|All in all this is a wonderful app, my only quirk is in offline mode you can't bookmark, highlight, etc. Most churches don't have free Wi-Fi so that's a problem for me. :-( Disappointed.
0763617105|5.0|So sweet story, one mom recomended it to me, she said he son loved to hear this story when he was going to sleep, and now I know why.
B00A81MV3U|1.0|To the above reviewers who think this was a good movie, who gave is 5 or even 3 stars, you are nuttier than the supposed unbelievable nutty main characters in this movie.  You must go watch a series of good moves, like Midnight Cowboy, The Godfather, and about 10,000 others before you even rate another movie.  The high review scores for this movie convinces me that we as a species are doomed.  THIS MOVIE STUNK.  I am embarassed for Robert De Niro that at the end of his career, he agreed to be in this lame movie.  What the hell was it about?<br /><br />I will give  you that it started off decent, had a good premise with potential, and I even laughed a bit.  But then it devolved into .... into...what?  I am not sure.  So the scriptwriter brainstorming must have said, hey, let's make her a slut, for unknown reasons, and yeah, throw in a dance contest that happened to fall on the same day as the big Philadelphia Eages football games vs. Dallas Cowboys?  Dance contest romance movies have now become a cliche, ever since Saturday Night Fever, Flashdance, and Dirty Dancing, and this was an awful attempt to resurrect the genre - because it was an afterthought for a terrible script.<br /><br />Also, the lead role was made for Ben Stiller.<br /><br />AWFUL!
B003ZHQVJO|1.0|I have no idea why. but after listening to it a couple times in the car it erased itself. I am a huge kid rock fan and buy all of his cd's when they come out. this was very disappointing.
1584282584|5.0|Having shot my first wedding yesterday, I can't emphasize how much this book helped me. After you put to use the concepts in this book, you'll never be worried about available light again. Cheers!
B003L7DK74|5.0|My life was empty & sad before Flight of the Conchords. Now it is magical & full of sparkly joy!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I love this series, I hope James continues to write like this.  I have read each book 3 times! They never get old or less boring .

B009MYARIK|3.0|I have read all of Sophie Kinsellas`s novels, and this one rates average among them. I found some of the characters a little weak, Ben especially, but it is what it is supposed to be...a lighthearted summer read.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|A great read! God bless the family of Chris Kyle. I will defiantly spread the word about this book!  Hoorah!
B00BHBBSZ2|2.0|I WAS LOOKING FOR SOMETHING VERRRRRY SIMPLE, THIS MIGHT BE FINE FOR SOME ONE WHO LIKES LOTS OF CHOICES BUT I REALLY WANTED LIKE &#34;A PIECE OF PAPER TO WRITE ON AND SAVE&#34; INSTEAD OF HAVING TO TYPE ON. BUT I'M SURE LOTS OF PEOPLE WOULD LOVE IT !
B005GFPZYK|5.0|Could not put it down!  Real insight into the war in Iraq and the brave men that fought against evil.  Deserves six stars for a riveting story.
B000001F76|5.0|I grew up listening to Hank Williams and I always liked his music.  I can well remember his hits, though Mom never cared for him because he \\"sang through his nose.\\"  Well, as the old Romans once said: \\"De gustibus non disputandum est,\\" or for those of you who flunked Latin: \\"There's no accounting for taste.\\"  The fact of the matter was, and is, I liked his music very much.  I'm not too sure if Mom approved or not, but my late wife liked him, too.  She loved it when I'd get out either my guitar or Dobro and pick out his songs.  This collection brings back a lot of memories, and it's a terrific compilation of Hank's material and performances.  I can tell you straight up, this is a great collection.  I just wish I could give it more than five stars, it's that good.  If you're like me and you loved his songs, then for cryin' out loud, get this set of CDs.  You won't be sorry you did, and if you're like me, you're in danger of wearing them out.
1476734941|3.0|The bbok is great.  Thorough and compelling.  I was inspired, but i simply could not survive on 500 calories.  between 650 and 700 was doable for me, but in any case, I was on it for a while(prbably not enough time) lost nothing and that was the end of that.

B007J4T2G8|4.0|Keeps you in suspense.  Interesting to say the least.  It makes you believe there is a Christian Grey out there. I could relate to Ana which was neat.

B008K6HN8I|5.0|Easy to use and works great on Kindle Fire Hd. Used with dolphin to watch videos for the videos that won't load on thefire.
B008HJGPVO|5.0|[[ASIN:B008HJGPVO AmazonBasics Multi-Tip Stylus for Kindle Fire and Touchscreen Devices (Black)]]<br />This is by far the BEST stylus I have ever purchased. It is extrmely well-made and I absolutely love the three different sized stylus tips (5mm, 6mm & 7mm).<br />This stylus feels great in the hand & works perfectly on my touchscreen smartphone. Highly recommend!
B007TNS6JI|4.0|good for killin stuff when you are bored or want to kill time. decent graphics, aiming is not easy but doesn't ruin the fun either.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|When I first started reading this book, I didn't know how I felt about it or of I could get into it. Yet for some reason I couldn't put it down and I'm so glad I didn't. I think everyone can relate in some way and learn a lot about life with all its ups and downs. Love love love!
B002VPE1WK|4.0|I wanted a compact backpack for my Nikon D3200 and some accessories. This backpack has plenty of room for everything I want to put in it and has a nice assortment of pockets and pouches for small items. The main interior storage area can be easily re-arranged to any configuration. An Ipad also fits perfectly into the front pocket which was an important criteria for me selecting a backpack. So far, so good!
B001V7YJMG|4.0|Visually beautiful film, amazing acting from the child actors. I feel like it left slightly too much unsaid, especially compared to the book, but over all a much-needed breath of fresh air in a tired genre.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book was unbelievable. I started reading and I couldn't put it down! It had so much action, adventure, and drama. I give it 5 stars
B0087HT36U|5.0|Really fun game even for my 3 year old.  Challenging at times but simple enough not to be irritating. Would love to see levels added though.
B000JMKTLO|4.0|Gillian Flynn has a stark, pull no punches method of writing that sucks the reader in as if they were driving past a car crash.  From the flawed heroine, Camille, to her troubled mother and sister, the story sucks you in and compels you.  The men in the story could do with a bit more fleshing out.  They are rather one dimensional, on the periphery of the female characters.  Whether it's a disconnected stepfather, a Kansas City detective, or the brother of a murdered child, I didn't get much beyond the shallow end from those characters.  Overall, I enjoyed the story and I will be reading more of her books.
B00CJVZB5W|5.0|HIS NEW ALBUM IS GREAT..SAW HIM IN CONCERT .THE BEST! I WOULD RATE HIM IN THE TOP THREE  CONCERTS I HAVE EVER SEEN.
B005LAIH3G|5.0|This is truly an awesome movie. Yes, for some it can be a lot to chew on and can turn people away in a hurry. But if you look past the effects the impossibility of the whole thing. You have a truly excellent story with twists and turns. I love story...an action film... A western...and a scifi flick all in one. I love it and if there ever is a sequel I will be there with bells on. Enjoy!
B009APMNB0|5.0|Unbeatable for what I paid. I used it on 3 monitors -- all from different manufacturers with different resolutions, etc. They all now show the same colors when I work on my photography.
B009U9S6FI|5.0|Read this book in a few days. I'd heard of it for years, and had it on my list. Getting around to it finally made sense. I was re-mapping my life, and I'm so glad that this became a compass. This is a kind of book that comes up into many conversations as organic as your own thoughts, it is full of quotes that you could write in a plaque in keep in the hall of your life forever.<br /><br />Frankl's story is told in such a way that you are not torn-apart by the tragedies of the Holocaust, rather that you come to understand them through the psychological analysis by which he portrays them. Logotherapy is extremely valuable and can help many people find themselves. This is a top book of the last century for sure.<br /><br />Must read.
0307352145|5.0|So, often, introverts feel uncomfortable or left out in the world of the extrovert. Well, no more! Now, the introvert will realize that the need for introspection and quiet is actually quite beneficial and the extrovert is actually missing out.
B004KZOWEG|2.0|I am an avid reader and normally can read 1-2 books per week, of all different genres. However, I could not get through this book. It was extremely tedious, due to irrelevant details scattered through out. These tidbits made it very hard to understand what was going on. It was as if the writer did not filter his research for the book; instead he just wrote everything he found. Because the text was so incomprehensible, the pictures and their captions in the book were easier to understand than the entirety of the actual book. If you like understanding (and enjoying) what you read, I do not recommend King Leopold's Ghost.
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|Recommended to me by one of my married friends. Me and my long-term boyfriend read it and we enjoyed it and used it to find out more about each other and our relationship. Would recommend to others.
B006VFLIYK|3.0|A decent read. Plot was fairly contrived and not fully believable. Bad guys seemed to go to a lot of trouble and risk to set up the ending. Might read more Baldacci but hope for slightly more realistic plot line.
1582701709|4.0|This is a good book. However, you can read the Bible. You can relate it to religion (as I do) or your spirituality... Bottom line is you can just read The Holy Bible. I do understand that not everybody have the same beliefs, so words of encouragement is always good to hear. Therefore, it is a good book.
B00CHI5B7A|4.0|Ryan Gosling plays the worst part ever. Josh Brolin and Penn do a great job! Worth a watch....just shows that back in the day the mobsters ran things .... now the power is with the mobsters aka US Government..... enjoy.
B008Q7O6VS|5.0|Great cd and you get to hear it in concert too, with some of my fav songs as well, a must buy for any mega-head fan!!!
B0052AC8C6|5.0|I watched this movie on my 27 inch monitor and in some parts of the movie it looked like 3D. I love the cinematography and the depth of color. The story line is excellent, look for Clint Eastwood near the end.
B0070DOHQS|5.0|No more laptop on the go its great when we need to use laptop sometimes and great to drop my file on Dropbox too.
0446585041|5.0|of course its cute-  i got as a gift for a big ellen fan- hope she reads it<br />ship was fast and great order.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|The book was sexy and very edgy, but enjoyable.  My love life is much more tame and less interesting than this book describes.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I read this book in one sitting because I simply could not put it down. Before I could even finish it I was recommending it to friends. This book keeps you interested by pulling on your heart strings and engaging your emotions. A must read.
B002NXZY8K|1.0|My husband and I rented the movie Casino, which is a great movie, however we wasted $4 trying to watch this movie.  We could only watch about 5 minutes of the movie before it would buffer and skip this continued on for several minutes.  We tried shutting our system down and restarting, this did not help.  We checked our internet speed and it was certainly fast enough to handle this movie.  Finally we gave up on watching the movie until the next day because the bandwidth that your company has is not enough to support the movie rentals.  We have decided that we will NEVER rent movies off of Amazon again because of what happened.  I sincerely hope you figure this out or else this business will be a losing proposition for your company.
B007SGM084|5.0|This book kept me on the edge of my seat, I hated putting this book down and couldn't wait until I could pick it up again!  EXCELLENT, Thank you!
B006TVQTHW|5.0|Great case keeps all my computer components nice and cool, and it's not a very expensive case either. Would recommend to anyone looking for a good case with great airflow.
B00CHSPB8Y|3.0|Good graphics, plays well on kindle fire HD. The blue crystals they use for money are slow to come by, but you can buy them for real money at a huge price. 100 dollars for 15000!  There are cheaper options as well, but I just think any game that ask for 100 dollars is a bit ridiculous. Anything to make money I guess, just seems very greedy
B005K17RU0|4.0|good source for up to date and usable information.  easy to get around app to see what you want to use.
B002CLBJPK|5.0|I like angela landsbury and I really like the cartoon world that they enter. the children are also fun characters. the songs aren't as memorable as the ones in mary poppins but the same basic concept is just as fun.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I love it I just love it the way they tell you this hunger games books are up there with Percy Jackson!! It a 7 or 5 books.I read them n 2 days I say get this book!!!!
B000001FS3|3.0|favorite songs are of course the first 4; after that I listen to it but it doesn't have the same feeling for me as the others.
B0006A9FKA|5.0|I've watched this movie so many times and it never gets old. Simon Peg rocks as usual, his dry sense of humor always ensures a good laugh.
B005LAIGN2|3.0|the story itself is intriguing but I guess there are many such tales as these. the actors do a decent job but I guess there is nothing particularly compelling about the way the story is told or the acting.
B00BJ9VBLI|5.0|Love the story line and the graphics. If you love matching games I highly recommend this app. Be careful though, it's highly addictive!!!!
0553593544|5.0|every time I read his books I feel as though I'm looking at a movie. the books are much better, obviously, at developing his character and there's more action invovled than the movie allows.
B0015DROBO|4.0|Excellent storytelling. Keeps you turning pages wanting more. Larsson is a master at keeping you guessing, the plot is truly ingenious.
B0051QIGP4|5.0|This album is phenomenal. Great music all around, I think I could listen to this CD and not skip any songs. Lady Gaga took a great deal of time with this CD and it shows. Loves it.
B009GEDP26|4.0|This is a thirties style show taking place now inNYC. Think Hepburn and Tracy in a contemporary scene. The novels are good, too.
B0002O7XW2|5.0|This movie is a classic. I hope I win lotto so I can build a car just like this. Seeing one at a car show sends chills through me. Everyone k owns the story behind the car so you don't need me to tell you its a good movie on the review. The seller had it at my house very fast and the price was excellent.
B000LTAY1U|5.0|Don't be deterred by the reviews that point out that it's not made in Japan!!  My Seiko 5 keeps to 2 seconds a day in all positions.  Excellent fit and finish throughout.  A bit heavy on the wrist if you're used to plastic quartz watches, I'd call it &#34;substantial&#34;.  It's a great everyday watch---cheap enough, but way too nice to be a beater.
B00COGZ8FU|3.0|Why doesn't Tom ever kiss the girl? Is he just teasing us<br />or what? I don't recall any kissing going on in Oblivion either<br />although there was ample opportunity.
B00AEFY66U|2.0|I remember trying and trying to sit through this 1974 version and being so bored and losing track of what was going on and why I should care.<br /><br />Check out the 2013 version which captures both the dazzling life and also the love story.  Just spectacular!
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|Great Game addictive. Good for childrens and people everywhere! A lot of levels and time consuming Game. You should really give it a try!
193700788X|5.0|You people that are pissed off it didn't end the way you thought it should just go away.  You learn how to write and you can determine what happens in your story line.  Great series.  Great author.  Stop giving negative ratings just because it didn't end the way you thought it should.  People that like this series will like this book if they do not come in with preconceived notions of what the story should be.  Ugh.  C. Harris - Kudos for a successful series.  As always, looking for your other works.
B00A83075M|5.0|This movie incorporates enough old video game humor mixed with cartoon fun to keep both adults and kids interested. We loved it.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|Great read by a true patriot. We need more men like this in the world. God bless the USA! Rip Mr. Kyle
B009JVSAVM|3.0|When purchasing this item I didn't expect amazon would have a seller that sold bootleg dvd's so I was surprised when I got these DVD's that they were not the real thing. I guess I should have known better considering the price. That being said these are some of the best bootleg dvd's i have ever gotten. The picture and sound may not be as good as the real thing but it is pretty damn good. Very good bang for the buck (no pun intended.)
B0062NAX1U|5.0|This movie was so inspiring.  The values presented were more than I could have hoped for in today's society.  Wholesome and heart-warming, this movie is a treat for the whole family!
B0063IH60K|4.0|This is a neat Solitaire game. I downloaded it to my Kindle, and have enjoyed it. Good graphics, lots of options for play. It's great for free times when you are waiting at the airport or train terminal. Try it!
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|Poor Jamie - once an abused orphan, now a lonely man. Poor Lydia, trapped taking care of her pious mother.  Can these two find happiness? This book brought laughter and tears.  A really good read, indeed!
B009MJU8PW|5.0|I bought this to represent one of my nieces, who I call Monkey, it is just what I wanted and goes with the turtle and bear I already have for nephew and other niece.
B000MNP2K8|5.0|Great movie. Best entry in the Bond series so far. Craig makes a superb Bond, no offends to the great Sean Connery.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|I enjoy sitting across the room hearing him laugh at these series. He has or has read all of them.
B00AE9UYJ4|5.0|this game is just like the computer version! I have the computer version and it is a little scarier than this but they did a great job! things to improve: the fog needs to be a little less thick and you should probably add some flashlight effects with the next update. but still great game and cant wait for chapter 2! see you later kindlers
B008220C38|3.0|I LOVE Keira Knightley, but this movie just wasn't one of the best ones I've seen. The ending left a lot to be desired. I don't recommend buying it. Rent it instead.
B00BGIC2J2|2.0|One of those movies that doesn't live up to the previews.  Not as funny as it could have been and more serious than it needed to be.  Also the story is totally unbelievable and depressing.  If it had been a straight up comedy it would have been pretty good but then they went and tried to make it a story with meaning.  Didn't work for me or the girlfriend who really wanted to see it.  We are both just over 40 so it was targeted at us.<br /><br />One good part from a guys perspective is Megan Fox is very hot in the movie so not a total loss.  But the wife is a total crazy bit$h.  Funniest part is in the credits with Melissa McCarthy going off on the principal but you can probably You Tube that.
B00975L81Y|5.0|I just love them.They continue to experiment and do new things, I will support them always. A good album to listen to with dimmed lights and a glass of wine.
B00136NUAC|5.0|Oddly enough I have never in all my years of fusion fandom ever heard this record. Great to hear John McLaughlin Herbie Hancock and many others creating the sonic palette of totally free expression.  Highly recommended
B000LJ9ZWO|5.0|Awsome movie, this is a classic. I would still love to see a real theme park like this. Someone needs to buy the movie writes and do a remake of this movie. Might as well remake furture world too.
B008AU7F3C|5.0|This CD occupied my car's player for weeks.  &#34;Lillies&#34; and &#34;Marilyn&#34; in particular kept running through my head, and really, only two of the songs risk skipping as I go through the CD.  A superb piece of work.
B005LAIGN2|5.0|A very well done film on a history that is only now becoming well known in this country. The action and special affects of this film are extremly well done. Excellent and I am glad to own it.
B00BTYP6QE|5.0|Great game to keep kids entertained. My kids would play this game forever if I would let them. Thanks for the app.
B00177YA1K|5.0|I bought the darn thing. Quit bugging me about reviewing it! If I had known that I'd be assaulted by request to right an essay about how I feel about my purchase, I would have stuck with eBay.
B00AEFY66U|4.0|This movie is a faithful interpretation of the novel. In comparison to other versions, the actors seem a bit long in the tooth, but they do grasp the characters. Redford is what the role requires, and although Farrow's interpretation is obnoxious, that's kind of how I pictured Daisy to be when reading the novel.
B0057R5G6E|5.0|I havent even opened the wrapping yet, it looks so cool I may not at all.  I don't want it to get ruined!!

B009IEXKXI|4.0|Very real scientific and mechanical descriptions on how to jury rig your way through survival on the Red Planet. Weir does a good job between shifting from the Robinson Crusoe style diary of the stranded Martian and the attempts of the ground crew to rescue him.
B00BF124PC|1.0|I'd give 3.5 stars to the movie itself, but the way the file was rendered on my TV was disappointing - so 1 star at best.  I tried adjusting the contrasting settings and everything else to see if it was the TV that was causing it, but this didn't approve anything.<br /><br />I borrowed a friend's Blu-Ray DVD to play the same movie on the machine and everything looked just fine.
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|With so many books you have a good idea where it will end up.  Not so this story of a broken man whose early life was spent in a tortuous orphanage.  What a wonderful ending for this poor man. A story that will stay with you long after you've finished the book.
B006TLFPKO|2.0|Yes, I'll admit, I own it, but only because I play rifftrax next to it and mock it as I note 'things not to do in movies or use as story guides'. On it's own, it's just one star, but with rifftrax, it's four stars, so it evens out to two. Everything is too convenient or too much wish fulfillment, to the point it's laughable, everybody besides a few awesome characters (I love you Leah!) would just accept and celebrate an 18 year old marry right out of high school, with no future goals planned. I know in the book, Bella 'applied' to college, but it's not even addressed in the movie. I was having fun, laughing, and then...it happened.<br /><br />Twilight was just supposed to be a stupid romance, that was it, it wasn't anything that hard to comprehend, but they then turn it around and said, 'let's talk about something that's dividing our nation: abortion' and lecture the audience on it. It not only undermines your female audience, but also angers the few men that do see it. I know some guys who were outrage when they saw it because it not only made both sides of the argument look bad, but it made the MEN's side look bad too, with Edward being all, 'we have to get rid of IT' like that's how guys will always act when there's an unplanned pregnancy, the first step is always abortion. You could argue (as I'm sure twi-hards do) that Edward was scared for Bella's life, but that's not how he is protraying it, he looks genuially angry at her, like it's only HER fault. He doesn't even talk to her when they travel. He just makes the decision and BLAM! we're back in Forks.<br /><br />Great marriage so far.<br /><br />I'm a girl, so I guess it's required by law that I talk about the wedding...but I won't because weddings are only romantic when the two people who are getting married are people you would root for to get married (At least to me). Also, Jacob imprinting....HAHA. It's not only stupid, but story wise, it's a cop out. Nessie can't have the freedom to find her own mate, like her mother (Because Bella gets everything she wants dammit!), no, one is chosen from her because Mommy couldn't learn to grow a pair and just tell Jacob 'yeah, no, we shouldn't even be friends because clearly you haven't gotten over me.' So Nessie get's Bella's sloppy seconds.<br />-From TEAM MUSTACHE DAD!ke her mother (Because Bella gets everything she wants dammit!), no, one is chosen from her because Mommy couldn't learn to grow a pair and just tell Jacob 'yeah, no, we shouldn't even be friends because clearly you haven't gotten over me.'

1439156816|5.0|Stephen King can write horror any day of the week, but it is really nice to see his other work as well.  &#34;On Writing&#34; is a great book for any writer. It is not a book that tells you how to be a writer, it is a book that talks about what worked for him. There is humor and directness in this book and I absolutely love it!

I love this game and have spent many hours playing it but every time I've made it to level 43 I has ended up linking my board with one of my neighbors boards showing all their items as if they were mine. Frustrated and angry. In order to fix the only solution is starting over.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Love it! The acting is great and the storyline is so true to life as well. Season 2 is pretty graphic though with WWII, but nothing I can't handle.
B009IJJ5B4|5.0|The show does a great job bringing the characters from the classic stories into modern day New York City with all new stories.
B009NY43NY|1.0|Very disappointing ending to a series that I loved.  It was almost as if Charlaine Harris just wanted to end the series with no real thought as to how or why.  Just a parade of everyone who had ever been in Sookie's life with no real meaning for their appearance in this book.  However, the characters we really wanted to see: Eric, Pam, and Bill were sadly lacking.  No one was presented in their true character in regards to the previous books especially Sookie's, Eric, Bill and Pam.

B001TD1XWG|5.0|Yet another good album from Lil Wayne. Glad I purchased it. Of course though it is not for little ears.
B00BWBHIUG|4.0|I gave it a 4 instead of 5 because it takes so long to build up the game.  For a young child, it wouldn't take long for them to become bored.
B009NY43NY|4.0|I was so hesitant about buying this book after reading all the bad reviews - but, I really enjoyed it! Granted it wasn't as good as some of the other books in the series...but it still was very enjoyable. Very glad I bought it!

1438074085|5.0|Barron's superpack is very good, but if you have bought the first edition, you don't need to buy this one, only one of them has been updated. I already have the first edition superpack, it's a waste of money.
B001DM1VXE|2.0|Movie seemed unreal and quite depressing.  I like movies that I can relate to and have a more pleasant ending.
B006BXTOFC|3.0|If you care about the overall aesthetic and are not critical about the composition, then this would probably be a great album for you.  Almost a contradiction in composition.  On the one hand, the songs are catchy and they do achieve a style that is their own, but the is a certain redundancy and limitation to the components they use to manifest their product.
B009NY43NY|2.0|I have read all 13 Sookie Stackhouse books and I hoped for a great ending that pulled everything together. If Ms. Harris was planning for Sookie to end up with a random guy she should have developed that plot line in previous books or even in this one. Very random ending.
B0013GH99A|5.0|One of their two best. Impressive creativity, as well as, musicianship make for an album that is truly epic. Very, very few albums, I like every song, but this is one of them. If more bands were as creative, innovative and unique as SOD, the world would be a much better place. (Well, the music world at least.)  :-)
B00AKL1XPU|1.0|Freezes when you go out in the wild. Tried to play on the kindle.<br />It's a shame as it looked fun
B004FRX0MY|4.0|Good product. Only complaint I would have is that you don't get any of the album history, information, details or extras of any sort you get with a physical product. It's strictly MUSIC ONLY!
B00C1LIYWM|4.0|A young woman is on the run and you don't really know the whole story about why. She changes her looks and slips out of Boston on a bus bound for anywhere. She winds up in a small town and she tries to keep a low profile and just survive as she is terrified that the police will find her. She thinks that she is in a safe haven but she will soon find out that may not be true.....<br /><br />My wife and I enjoyed this movie and thought it was entertaining and suspenseful. Katie (Julianne Hough) did a good job playing the runaway and Alex (Josh Dunamel) was also very good as the local man in the safe haven who is attracted to Katie. We thought the acting was good in the film but perhaps the Psycho Cop was overdone a bit.<br /><br />The story line is good and it is a suspense film with a love story built in. It has a surprise ending and we liked the movie. It was not rated well by the professional critics but like many other movies we liked it and they didn't. So what else is new? People like to criticize Julianne's acting but we thought she did a good job. The movie is worth watching.
B00122Z5RI|5.0|If you know punk, you already know this album. If you don't know this album, you don't truly know punk (not that this album encompasses every aspect in the world of punk music or is even the basis of it) . This foundational album is a must in any serious punk collection. If you don't like it, your idea of punk must be Avril Lavigne (fyi: SHE'S NOT EVEN REMOTELY PUNK!!!) There simply cannot be enough good things said about this work, so I won't try. Excellent writing, great energy and even socially relevant, even to this day.
193700788X|2.0|I'm confused.  Did Charlaine Harris authentically write this book?  Or did the publisher pull a fast one?  Because this book was definitely uncharacteristic of the rest of the series.  The writing was apathetic at best, with glaring holes in the continuity from past books.  The characters seemed disconnected and there was no \\"flow\\" from one chapter to the next.  It was just very frustrating to read and I only finished it out of sheer will.
B005GFPZYK|4.0|This is an excellent book. And story of a man who truly put his desire to fight to valuable use for America. What I liked about his story was the spirit that was in him. This is the kind of spirit that should be in all American boys growing up, today we punish boys for displaying this type of behavior instead of directing them to use it in a way that would benefit society namely fighting evil . We needs boys who will become men like Chris Kyle in every aspect of our culture. This book should be mandatory reading in all our high schools, it would do many of our educators and politicians well to read this book.
B000HL09MG|1.0|This is without a doubt the strangest movie I have ever seen.  I kept watching hoping it would somehow make sense and get better, never happened.  If you want to watch a bunch of nude women wondering around, this is the movie for you, as far as the story, there really isn't much of one.
B0084AXZK0|5.0|This novel is one of the best novel I have ever read. Among many themes, I think that beauty and influence are the most important. Beauty fades away and it's deceiving, because  something beautiful on the outside can be rotten on the inside. Influence is very powerful and dangerousm especially when a sly and witty nobleman as Henry Wotton exercise it on a young innocent young man like Dorian. The protagonist's degradation happens step by step until punnishment comes.<br />I'm sure you will not let this book down.
B005GG0MIS|5.0|The President's Club offers a different sort of view of the Presidency.  The relationships between Presidents are, in many cases, very surprising.  Examples include Clinton's closeness with both Presidents Bush and the animosity between Truman and Eisenhower.  It is entertaining and informative to see friends become enemies and enemies reconcile.  You develop a sense of each President's personality in a way I've not encountered before.  Some that you expect to dislike you might find personally endearing.  Others toward whom you may be warmly disposed will disappoint you in person.<br /><br />The book is well written.  The authors have constructed a narrative style that reads easily and delightfully.  Far from a dry non-fiction tome, this book is relaxing and fun to read.  It's not every history that turns out to be a page turner, but this one does it!
B009T8XBBO|5.0|After reading reviews about this app having IAPs inside, I was leary about downloading it. ( I always uninstall apps like that.) But there were a few reviews that said they didn't have IAPs and they liked this app... What the heck it was a free app,  so I downloaded it. I love this app. So far it's still a free app for me. no extra costs to pay to play. Maybe they took out the IAPs because of bad reviews? Who knows.... I do enjoy this app. Yes it does have you running back and forth a lot but I still love to play it. I can see myself reaching the end,  then starting the game over again. I see the price is 3.99 now. I'm torn over if its worth that or not. Maybe $3 would be a better price. Oh I should add I have a kindle fire ( 1st gen.) and it is hard to read some of the small ikons. You do figure out what they do after some trial and error.
B009NY43NY|3.0|Over the course of this series, I have thoroughly enjoyed the world that Charlaine Harris created. There were some real highs and some deep lows. Even though I would highly recommend this series, I will admit to what I term \\"series fatigue.\\" I loved the first 5 or so books, but by book 9 or 10, I was weary. I don't know if the stories weren't as good to me anymore or if some of the intimacy of the characters themselves was lost to me. In the last 2 books, I feel that some equilibrium was restored.<br /><br />Which brings me to Dead Ever After. The book picks up where Deadlocked ended. While Sookie is dealing with the consequences of her actions at the end of Deadlocked, she is also trying to suss out what is happening with her relationship with Eric. Then she gets arrested for murder!<br /><br />It's the end of our journey with Sookie and it's definitely time. Old enemies resurface. Old friends circle the wagons for Sookie. To sum up my feelings on the book, I only need 2 words: I'm satisfied. The story didn't end the way I wanted it to, but it didn't lessen my enjoyment of the book or make me bitter about the choices that Harris made. Sookie's journey was earned. After losing family and friends, being kidnapped, tortured, staked, beaten up, house set on fire, betrayed by friends and lovers, killing humans and supes, Sookie is STILL standing. She's her own person and I'm proud of her.
B000063Y8F|5.0|After reading the other reviews of this product - thank you fellow reviewers - I went ahead and ordered what is admittedly an expensive garlic press.  This item is SO worth it !  It is now one of my go to kitchen tools along with my OXO Salad Spinner and Vitamix !
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|Literally, I laughed out loud. Several times. I've always enjoyed Tina Fey's humor, and appreciated her take on the issues coveted in the book. She did not sugar coat her experiences or lifestyle now that she is famous. This made me love her even more!
B00BUCW54Q|2.0|First off, I am not familiar with the character or the book.  But if the book was created with a lot of bad dialogue in mind,  more than a hint of overacting, and a plot a five year old child could follow, then this movie hit the nail on the head!<br /><br />I can not forgive the dialogue.  The writing for this film script was atrocious.  The actors from Cruise down were not remotely believable in any instance.  The evil doers reminded me of Dr. Evil from Austin Powers.  You remember that guy right?  (1,000,000 dollars...)  The fight scenes were not even remotely entertaining or enthralling.<br /><br />I lamented over every aspect of this movie.  The only reason I gave it two stars is because while the movie was playing out I was able to bask in it's mediocrity as though I was a member of Mystery Science Theatre 3000.  (You might get that, you might not.)<br /><br />Bottom line...this was not enjoyable.

B004ECFW94|3.0|This production has Domingo singing lead as a baritone. He is OK but he is better in the 1995 production as a tenor. Also Giordani just does not cut it in the tenor role. Buy the 95 production. Staging is the same but singing and acting are better in the earlier version.

193700788X|5.0|Just recently when rearranging my book collection it occurred to me that I couldn't remember the release date for the latest SVM novel. Lo and behold it was out! Of course I got on to the interwebs to order it straightaway... then I saw all the negative reviews about the book and I had second thoughts.<br /><br />Some people seemed to just have an issue with the fact that Sookie didn't end up with either Bill or Eric. (God forbid she end up with the one person who could give the normal life she wants, and be happy)(also if you really, really read the story, Ms. Harris has been hinting at who Sookie really belongs with since the very first book) However, so many people said that the book was poorly written, \\"as though she were bored and being careless\\" with the story. Also \\"there was little if no storyline.\\"<br /><br />Firstly, if you look at all the other books this book is not written any more \\"carelessly\\" than the others. If anything they've all gotten progressively better, this one included. As to the \\"lack\\" of storyline. This book was a conclusion. It was tying up loose ends. Read a academic paper. This was a well structured end to a well structured story.<br /><br />After reading the book myself, I can only conclude that with today's audiences' infatuation with vampires, people were hoping/expecting/demanding that Miss Stackhouse end up with one of her vampire lovers, preferably turned, because how else could anyone be happy(insert sarcasm). Though I was one of those people who began reading these books because of the TV show, I'm happy I read them. They are so much better than the TV show that is based on them. I respect the fact that Harris wasn't one of those people, who after seeing how popular the books, tv show etc. were decided to scrap her intended ending by extending the series and/or compromising how it would end to boost sales (like (I think) the tv show is doing).<br /><br />I feel that I could continue on trying to explain why this was not only a good ending for the series but the right one, but I think it simply comes down to enjoying the hard work someone put into writing a 13 book series, or just thinking that it needs to end the way you want it because the universe revolves around you...<br /><br />P.S. If you hate this ending so much attempt to write your own ending to match the quality of this one. It isn't as effortless as Ms. Harris makes it look.
B0047SF41G|5.0|Love the Predator series, some better than others, but this 1 was probably 1 of my favorites. But as all good things must come to an end. Hope this is the last of the series.

145552347X|5.0|Hitchens' discussion of death and his experience as terminally ill cancer patient is sober, to say the very least.  What's absolutely remarkable is his ability to articulate the experiences, not something that is easily done when dealing with such a unique experience -unique in the sense that terminal illness is known to those who have lived through it, and difficult to us not in \\"Tumorville.\\"  Even beyond that, Hitchens displays his typical masterful use of language, sometimes cynically jovial, sometimes bitingly sarcastic.  I never cease to be amazed at how he knows just how to phrase something to get the desired reaction, and how he doesn't need a flowery expression, just a well configured sentence to do so.  I do think that, of the couple of books of his I have read, and numerous articles, he writes much more in the manner of his verbal locution in this text than others.  While reading, I felt as though I heard precisely his voice in my head, and speaking in just the manner he does in debates and interviews.<br /><br />It appears to me that Hitchens has given one of the best treatments of such a grave subject as has ever been written.  I hope Hitchens would take as a compliment that he out performs C.S.

Hitchens demonstrates this honesty by taking on Pausch's \\"Last Lecture,\\" bringing, what seems to be, valid criticisms from someone who knows.  (I had to re-read parts of the \\"Last Lecture,\\" since Hitchens brought it up, and it is an exercise in comparative reading that I recommend.)

B00BTYP6QE|4.0|its very good but i wish there were more super powers. i love om nom he is so cute you should get this game!
0425220931|5.0|Most people reading this probably know that Victor Wooten is a bass player best known for his supernaturally fast and technical slap-style chops: he plays complex passages faster than most people can even think or hear them, with a kind of contrapuntal rhythmic intensity, that creates a sort of polyrhythmic, polyphonic impression of music moving faster than the speed of thought, while still sounding like funky, danceable grooves that anyone can get down to.<br /><br />If that's all you know of Victor Wooten, you might be expecting his book on music to be a compendium of speed-building exercises, licks and tricks, and practice regimens... a kind of manual for would-be bass guitar virtuosos.<br /><br />This book is absolutely not that. It will not teach you double-thumbing, or pinky-hammers, or claw-hammer picking, or anything like that. In fact, if you read this book without knowing anything about Victor Wooten, you might think you were reading something written by a rank beginner still learning to play quarter-note blues-progressions, because that is how he regards himself. It is impossible to overstate how accessible this book is, even for complete non-musicians.<br /><br />If anything, Wooten takes a blase, almost dismissive attitude towards practice, technical exercises, and so on. Instead, \\"The Music Lesson\\" is a story told as a series of parables, musical life-lessons taught to the narrator by a sequence of semi-mystical characters whose reality is left ambiguous... It is written as an autobiography of sorts, but the main character is not Victor Wooten, it is instead the almost supernatural figures who pop in and out of the life of a young bass-player struggling to \\"make it\\", and who answer questions he never even thought to ask. Reading this book, one gets the impression that Victor Wooten is some sort of clumsy beginner, rather than the premier virtuoso of his instrument.<br /><br />The book is structured as a sort of \\"Pilgrim's Progress\\", with Victor Wootenas a kind of vanishing everyman, struggling to learn the ways of music, led by a series of semi-mystical teachers through vast, philosophical (and often dubious) concepts of math, physics, etymology, nature, morality, and science. This \\"music lesson\\" sometimes seems to be a lesson in everything BUT music, but it all turns back to music, and every chapter will make you a better player, even if you disagree with it or find fault with the science.<br /><br />The book is written as a factual narrative, but it is hard to know what to believe, in a historical sense. Wooten weaves myth and magic together with practical life-lessons in a way that makes it difficult to untangle dreams from reality. New-age-y and mystical concepts are freely interwoven with practical tips, but this is not a \\"flaky\\" book. It is emphatically a music lesson, as the title suggests.<br /><br />It is remarkable how much an absolute technical master and virtuoso is able to teach, without a single fingering exercise, practice-regimen, or anything of the sort. Aside from the chapter-headings, there is not a single note of printed music in the book, it's all purely conceptual. It is also remarkable how little ego there is in this book: it's not a book about Vic Wooten, best bass-player alive, it's a book about Vic Wooten, student and beginner, trying to make progress.<br /><br />If you are reading reviews of this book, stop reading and buy it.

I would recommend this app to any age.

B00BUCW54Q|5.0|This movie is a perfect detective-action suspense movie.  On par with \\"The Fugitive\\" (Harrison Ford) and \\"US Marshalls\\" (Tommy Lee Jones).  This isn't supposed to be a drama masterpiece.  But it isn't a fluffy action movie either.  Great character development: the district attorney's estranged daughter, the lone ranger ex-army cop, and the mysterious corporate evil man out to ruin the world.<br /><br />Definitely a great watch.

B00CL68QVQ|5.0|Most of us have had to be educated emotionally at some point in our lives. This wonderfully told story manages to invite a range of identification with the emotional issues the characters in the film encounter that goes beyond their particular circumstances. I found myself strongly involved with many of the characters in this movie. It could be that beyond the typical categories of leading and supporting roles this movie manages to cast societal mental and spiritual disorder as a transcendent character in the film to which all the characters play a supporting role. I believe almost anyone after watching the film will find some new space for reflection and healing because the actor's performances all connect us with and give permission to feel very typical but awkward and uncomfortable emotions that we would often like to just avoid. If you have the opportunity, this would be a great movie to see with people (even if only virtually) that you trust and care about so you could discuss what happened for you when you watched it.

B008133MDK|5.0|After watching Season 1, I was a little bit worried that Sherlock could never meet that level again. Luckily, I was very wrong. Sherlock remains a smart, funny, fast-paced mystery show while tackling some of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's most iconic stories. 'A Scandal in Belgravia' and 'The Reichenbach Fall' are as good or better than anything in Season 1, but 'The Hounds of Baskerville,' while still incredibly enjoyable, fails to reach the same level of quality. The creators did an amazing job!

B007RCJNDE|5.0|I have read and re-read the books in this series for years, the only one that I can go back to time and again, always finding something new to amaze me, and the Memory of Light did not fail. Such a pity that we won't be able able to follow these characters any more!
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Excellent game! I play a lot of this type of game and thought this was the best and hardest in a long while.  Sound effects and graphics are awesome. Thanks for the challenge.
B00B2QG3K2|5.0|I love this album, I love the band, and I love the style change, though my opinion may be biased to be truthful. I probably would have ignored half of all Paramore songs if I had discovered Paramore after the release of this self-titled album because I would have thought of them to be either clich&eacute;, too optimistic/positive, too corny, too 'not-exactly-my-style', or all of the above. I have loved Paramore, and their past and present band members, for many, many years now, and not just for their talent, but also for their genuine acts and words towards their fans and their meaningful music, so the positivity and uniqueness of this album could not (and will not) draw me away. Whether the songs of the album seem to be clich&eacute; and corny, or not, all of the songs as a whole still have this one important purpose: to make listeners happy. In my opinion, the mission has been accomplished.<br />The album is well worth the money. It includes seventeen songs, three of them being interludes, and my purchase came with a digital version of the album to my Amazon cloud, which I am so very grateful for.<br /><br />Was this honest review helpful?

B0086700CM|5.0|Just got my Kindle and Temple Run. Love this game! Great graphics and very addictive. I can play this for hours without realizing it. Highly recommend!<br /><br />Update:I've been playing this game for less than a week and all of a sudden today the app opens in upsidedown Portrait and will not flip to opposite Portrait which it has been doing for me until today. I deleted and installed it a few times, closed the Kindle a few times, I even wrote on the forum to no avail--so I'm not sure if it's my new Kindle Fire HD or the game--so I'm just going to delete it for the last time. Too bad cause I really enjoyed the game.<br /><br />Update: I happened upon a review for the MoKo Case written by Kim Mai and she addresses the problem described above--I tried what she said and it works!!! Needless to say, I reinstalled this game and am happy again. I just can't thank her enough.

B006FTCH2E|4.0|I actually like the fact that the director didn't put too much emphasis on special effects and the natural effect such phenomena would have on our planet. That would have taken away from the much deeper underlining story &#34;about a girl who does something unforgivable&#34; as the trailer says. The story is fantastic, the drama intense, the emotions real and the ending...definately more than worthy of the standing ovation it got at film festivals all around the world. Only reason it got a 4/5 is because I think with a bigger budget and a few minor changes elsewhere this could be an even greater work of art!

1451695195|3.0|Dr. Eben Alexander's book \\"Proof of Heaven\\" is a confusing diatribe about the possibility of life after death, based upon what he describes as an NDE experience which occurred when he developed a rare meningitis in 2008.  He professes to have spoken to God (whom he calls 'Om') and to have gone to the edge of heaven.  The story is a woven tale between his illness, stories about his family, scientific theory about NDEs, and lastly the actual NDE.  A warning to those are thinking about reading this - the NDE sections make up only a minority of the book, which is only ~170 pages long.<br /><br />I appreciate Dr. Alexander's attempt to quantify what is largely unexplainable.  I am a physician and as such have often struggled with the concept of NDE and have read other accounts like Don Piper's '90 Minutes in Heaven'.  But I believe this book has several shortcomings which makes it difficult to completely accept what Dr. Alexander says in it:<br /><br />1. While he tries to compare his experience to others' NDEs, his clinical experience (i.e., coma) is not like other books I have read, in which the person had actually suffered cardiac arrest and was clinically dead.  There is no mention of brain death in this book, so I can't be sure that Dr. Alexander was really near death in the same way that others were.  While he was critically ill, and not expected to survive, I don't see his condition as similar to others, like Don Piper.<br /><br />2. The descriptions of what he remembered when he had the NDE are confusing at best (e.g., 'the earthworms-eye view') and don't match what other books have described.  Dr. Alexander's descriptions and language make it difficult to follow what he was trying to describe, and I think make it more troublesome to believe as a true NDE versus just a dreamlike state that he experienced while he was in a coma.  (In Dr. Alexander's defense, he does acknowledge in a chapter towards the end that his NDE was different than the 'typical' NDE).<br /><br />3. Dr. Alexander spends a lot of time trying to scientifically explain what happened, using conjecture and theory mixed together.  But he actually offers little concrete proof that what he experienced is more than a dream rather than an NDE. (Caveat: there is one revelation at the end of the book which is consistent with what others have said about NDEs).<br /><br />There is no doubt that what Dr. Alexander experienced clinically is miraculous.  He survived a condition which 97% of others do not.  He woke up rapidly from a deep coma in ways that others do not.  While it took some time for him to regain his brain function, he suffered no ill consequences as a result.<br /><br />There is also no doubt that Dr. Alexander believes sincerely that what he experienced was a true NDE and that it proved to him the existence of God and Heaven.  The problem is that when you read the title of the book, you expect something more concrete, scientific and clear about the existence of an afterlife, and you really don't get that in this book.<br /><br />As a physician, I do believe that there is some sort of afterlife and that some of the concepts that Dr. Alexander puts forth in this book are intriguing, but I urge caution.  If you are looking for a feel good book, a book which makes you go 'a-ha' about NDEs, or a science-based description of how NDEs could possibly represent true experiences, this isn't it.  I am not sure that the perfect book exists, but this isn't it.<br /><br />I do urge you to read this if you are interested in NDEs, but be careful, because I fear you won't get what you expect out of it by reading it.  I sure didn't.br />3. Dr. Alexander spends a lot of time trying to scientifically explain what happened, using conjecture and theory mixed together.

B005LAIIHG|5.0|I read the book - listened to it on audio and therefore was expecting so much from the movie<br />Ang Lee delivered<br />As soon as the first scene played out where you see all the animals full on - but only get to see Richard Parker as a reflection in a pond - I knew it was going to be a superb rendition of the story<br />Incredible photography special effects<br />Anyone / Everyone should have this movie in their collection<br />I think it will - in time - become a masterpiece
B009AMANH4|4.0|We hadn't seen this movie before we bought it.  Oddly enough we watched Abraham Lincoln Vampire Hunter which made me want to see this movie, so I ordered it.  I forced the hubby to sit down and watch it with me one weekend and we were both drawn in and interested in what was going on.  We all know how the story ends, but this movie gets past that and pulls you in.

B0082Z447U|4.0|I read this book after listening to Nora Ephron's book, I Feel Bad About My Neck. Nora loved this book and wrote so entertainingly about being engrossed in the plot, to the exclusion of the work going on around her. I so loved her - and have to admit that I wouldn't have read it without her recommendation.  There were so many entertaining and downright funny parts - and it was enjoyable to think of it being serialized in the 1860s - and the monthly installments arriving and being read aloud or silently by the eager readers. I laughed out loud when Mrs. Catherick, feeling that her reputation has been abused, invites the hero, by letter, to come apologize at tea time, pointing out that her \\"tea and buttered toast wait for no one.\\"
B00821OX98|5.0|I saw the previews for the start of season 3 and heard some people talking about it on facebook so I thought I'd start watching it. I was worried that I wouldn't be able to watch from the beginning but when I checked it out on Amazon Prime I found out that the first 2 seasons are free. The first 5 episodes of season 1 have been excellent.

B002EEP3NO|5.0|The Lego Death Star (DS) is an amazing and unique Lego build experience. Although it is one of the largest Lego kits ever produced and has a brick count on par with some of the UCS kits, it is minifig scale and built for play. The DS is a unique setting in the original Star Wars universe - it hosts many of the most memorable scenes in the movies and more screen minutes than any other single location. The Lego kit embraces this role and allows you to build and re-enact every iconic DS scene in movies 4 & 6 with over 16 different areas and 24 minifigs. I built it with my 5 year old son and it was a truly fun experience for both of us. For fans of both Star Wars and Lego this is quite possibly the best toy ever made.<br /><br />That said, it's an extremely expensive kit. It's hard to justify spending this much money on any toy. In the end I rationalized it to myself as an \\"experience\\" rather than just a one off toy purchase. My son and I spent over 20 hours building it together. This equates to about four ball games with comparable pricing. In a few years I'm looking forward to taking it apart and building it again, this time with our now-three-year-old helping as well.<br /><br />Pros:<br />- Huge number of minifigs<br />- Great attention to detail<br />- Provides setting for every iconic DS scene plus new areas for creative play<br />- Encourages many hours of post build play<br />- Tremendous amount of functionality - nearly every area has something that moves or opens<br />- Not too many stickers<br /><br />Cons:<br />- Very expensive<br />- Fragile<br />- Tightenting the 2xN bricks without toppling the model can be tricky for small hands<br />- Central elevator is hard to actually play with<br />- Build techniques are good but not quite on par with the Creator kits<br /><br />Bottom line: It's a unique kit with a ton of play value. They won't make it forever so if you have Star Wars / Lego fans in your household that you'd like to spend some quality building timewith, go get it now.
B000F8O35U|4.0|however, when i bought this dvd it paused on me twice... it took 6 yrs to get this dvd b/c in the past it was so expensive. however, i wanted my boys to see it and they LOVED it and wanted to watch it again. well worth the buy for 17.00 dollars.

B00AHTYI5M|5.0|I don't pay much attention to Hollywood, didn't even know when I went to see this movie that Ben Afflect not only starred (I had only seen him in comedies) but directed this show and wons Oscars.  Anyway I was profoundly affected with the story, although the introduction purposely or not leaves out some salient facts about the Shaw that was exiled.  Another cliffhanger about that time and people who had to find a way out based on a couple of Ross Perot's staff who were instrumental in installing Social Security for Iranians, the book is by Ken Follett, the movie I believe was made for TV, both called, &#34;On Wings Of Eagles&#34;.  History is important.

B001UGB1X8|4.0|I'm pretty bright and can follow a plot line even when things are vague. Although I loved the authenticity of the landscape in this film, as well as the actors, especially Tommy Lee Jones, I found myself confused at times, especially in light of the fact that the dead prostitute cases didn't seem to have much to do with the murder in 1965.  At the end, I still didn't understand completely why the women were killed, or, why the African-American man was killed in 1965.  I know it had been implied in a few conversations along the way that he \\"messed with a white man's wife,\\" but I wish that someone had explained that whole story in more detail.  I also didn't understand why the man killed the prostitutes.  Was he crazy?  Did they know something?  That wasn't made clear.  I'm sure if I had read the book, it would have all made sense.  In any case, the film was definitely entertaining and Jones was great.  There is something purely mystical about the bayous of Louisiana - so rich in history both bad and good, and teaming with character and culture.  I love films set in this area when they are done well, and like Skeleton Key, this film manages to capture the uniqueness of the area, without making it too over the top.  I recommend for anyone that likes this landscape in story and film, and anyone who loves Tommy Lee Jones.
B0012GMV58|5.0|I bought \\"Welcome\\" in 1973 and in my view it's an underrated and timeless classic. It has, over the years, become one of my favorite albums, mainly because I still get a thrill when I listen to it. Like the band's previous album \\"Caravanserai\\", there is a heavy jazz influence. Santana and Shrieve were both listening to a lot of Miles Davis, John Coltrane and John McLaughlin at the time, and you can hear those influences on the record. As well as the instrumental tracks, there are also some great songs on the record. The vocalists include Leon Thomas, Wendy Haas and Flora Purim. The album features guest appearances by McLaughlin, Alice Coltrane, and Joe Farrell.<br /><br />My favorite track is the 11 minute \\"Flame-Sky\\" featuring some of the best guitar playing you will ever hear on record. Santana and John McLaughlin were probably the best electric guitar players around at that time. They both compete for attention and the resulting solos are breathtaking.<br /><br />Tom Coster (who plays keyboards) has said that the music probably went over the heads of most of their fans. The same could said of most rock critics, then and now. Because of this backlash, Santana decided to adopt a more commercial approach on subsequent albums. To be honest, I lost interest in Santana's music after \\"Welcome.\\"<br /><br />This is a great record and a wonderful example of how fusion should sound. The music is complex yet accessible and the musicianship is superb.
B00BT0ZDF2|5.0|No doubt about it, Cloud Atlas is ambitious.  From cramming six stories into its three hours to having actors take on so many varied roles, it truly is a movie like no other and it's all the better for it. The film simply tells six stories, jumping around back and forth between the different stays.  What makes it work though is it helps the viewer see the connections they are trying to make.<br /><br />The beginning can be a little confusing until you figure out the structure.  Then it becomes very rewarding as the film starts to fall together in the end.  IT's coupled with some very amazing performaces, with Ben Whimshaws possibly being the standout dramatic performance.  The one who seems to be having the most fun is Hugo Weaving, who gets to play a femal nurse in one part.<br /><br />The visuals are stunning, from the ocean landscapes depicted in the 1800s to the futuristic Neo-Soul and the post apocolyptic world that followed.  The movie's on target and the locations are continually interesting throughout the film.  Kudos the directors for making the varied settings fun and authentic.<br /><br />Many reviewers remark on the confusing plot structure, but if you pay attention, it comes together.  As you piece it together, you'll be rewatching it to see all the nods each story pays to other parts of the story.  Many people who I've watched it want to rewatch it, and enjoy it even more the second time round.<br /><br />This was easily one of my favorite films of the year and it really got a raw deal from many critics.  But it's endlessy arresting and love it or hate it, you'll be talking about it afterwards.
B000PMG16U|4.0|Ohh my God!! I was just watching these movies and all I have to say is that is really great to be able to watch such a great trilogy on HD.  The only cons that I have with these movies are that you can't set up the audio to run at 5.1 without the commentaries.  You can have audio set up to 6.1 without commentaries but for my luck my receiver only process audio up to 5.1.

B0031Y4ADK|5.0|This concert on vinyl is outstanding. Every momment of the concert has been included; the guitar tuning with the keyboards, the drums warming up. The audience patiently humming in the background. Every gap between songs, you even hear the tape the show was recorded on snap into life.<br />The dynamic range of vinyl transports you right there amongst the action. The set list is later Doors with a focus on blues; and being later era Doors songs from Morrisson Hotel are here. All members of the Doors are on fire with Morrisson sounding terrific . This is the Doors playing in front of their favourite audience after all.<br />The Doors played 4 shows at Felt NY in January 1970 - this is the first of these shows to have a vinyl release. Here's hoping the others will as well .

B007PRQNIE|5.0|I loved Kate Morton's \\"The House at Riverton\\", and \\"The Forgotten Garden\\" doesn't disappoint either. But be warned, this is quite a hefty read and can get a bit confusing at times with the moving back and forth between different time periods. However, the story is engaging enough that it was a fast read for me.<br /><br />The story begins in 1913 London with a little 4-year-old castaway on board a ship headed for Australia. She waits for a woman, the Authoress, who told her she would be back, but never returns. In Australia, the little girl is taken in by the port master, Hugh O'Connor, and his wife. The girl, Nell has no recollection as to her origins and is raised by the O'Connors as their own. It is only when she turns 21 that Hugh tells her the truth.<br /><br />In 1975, Nell makes her way to England to unearth the mystery of her origins, but setbacks in her life dampen her efforts. It is only much later, in 2005, that Nell's beloved granddaughter, Cassandra, who was pretty much raised by her grandmother finds out that she has inherited a cottage in Cornwall, and makes the long-due journey to England to discover her grandmother's roots.<br /><br />As mentioned by other reviewers, this is very much a story about women and the complexities of their lives. It makes for an engrossing read. There are many themes in this multi-layered story and I was riveted throughout. Fairy tales are seamlessly woven into the narrative and we even have a beloved author of literature, \\"The Secret Garden\\"'s Frances Hodgson Burnett mentioned in here. \\"The Forgotten Garden\\" was possibly inspired by this classic of children's literature. Personally, I found much more to appreciate in \\"The Forgotten Garden\\" than in \\"The House at Riverton\\" and look forward to more intriguing reads by Kate Morton.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is addicting if I was allowed to play this game all the time I would play it 24/7 all day every day.
B00AZM7IQC|5.0|I have watched this movie 3 times , twice in one day and enjoyed it each time. Terrific acrobatics and the whole thing to me was above expectations
B008TRUDAS|5.0|This book really had my heart from the beginning anecdotal have you rooting fir love all the way The twist and turns are something out of real life and you will fall in love with all the main characters in this book You will root fir them, be mad at and with them, laugh with them and cry with them I can't wait to dive into the next book Colleen Hoover is becoming one of my favorite authors as I read Hopeless first and loved it
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|This game is really challenging I like it .But sometimes it's hard . The controls are really good and you could use  almost all of the armors . If you are a iron man fan purchase this game I am only 11 and I know allot about games and superheroes
B00BLCHYKU|5.0|I missed this episode on the DVR when the series started! It was easy to download on prime and watch! Great picture
B0062CTYRA|5.0|Every once in a while, a book comes along that mesmerizes, and this one certainly does that and more! I was utterly captivated by the plot, one which has many layers to it. Vida Winter is a dying writer who wishes that another writer write her biography, yet there are so many mysteries lurking, and puzzles to be unraveled that the writer chosen by Vida finds herself uncovering more than she bargained for as she goes about unearthing Vida's past. There is definitely a Gothic feel to Ms. Setterfield's writing and it brings to mind novels like Rebecca, Wuthering Heights, Northanger Abbey and even lesser known Gothic romances. \\"The Thirteenth Tale\\" is utterly compelling and compulsively readable!
B00BCA29WY|5.0|Wow! Loved this CD! This, to me, is what progressive rock is all about. The level of playing talent here is totally off the hook! The vocals, harmonies, and melodies are beautiful, and a lot of this grooves! And mostly for me, they almost always sound original, not trying to copy from the greats of the past. Yes, there are a few moments that may remind you of Yes, but for me, that was very minimal. This is one CD that will not disappoint Prog lovers.
B004DLPXAO|1.0|sucks did not like it just a waste of time just buy a real kindle just a waste of memory
B000IZ21BS|5.0|This is a great classic for its time and is kind of funny.  I would recommend this film to anyone that likes horror or is into dools that come to life.
B00992CF6W|5.0|great game but updates need to come a little faster and multiplier needs to be updated to because I'm tired of putting in my house WI-FI to play with my friends
B00571F26Y|5.0|Very educational!  I am planning to make some big changes as I am reading this and just shocked and what I thought but never read.  Someone finally put this in writing!!  I have gluten and lactose sensitivities and so does my daughter so this book is just wonderful!!
B004H4XI5O|5.0|Very entertaining and informative.  Foer goes in-depth and in a very lively style brings us into the world of mnemonics.  A terrific book.  Highly recommended.
B00CHSPB8Y|3.0|The game is very good, but it is too boring. You have to always do the same thing over and over again. I was a better player the first hour than the other hours playing this because it was too boring and I wasn't trying anymore.
B003V6L94Q|5.0|I saw Zac Brown band live at the blues festival and definitely needed to get this album, it's full of genres you wouldn't expect together. Love the vocals.
B007PT3QOQ|3.0|I was addicted to the game, felt like I was back in middle school. The game completely restarted and I didn't feel like continuing on and doing everything completely again.
B000B8QEYC|5.0|This is very Enya and I enjoy it tremendously.  It is a great addition to my collection of CDs by Enya.  Recommend it to all Enya and celtic music fans.
B0086700CM|4.0|My ten yr old loves this game. It was the first game she requested when we bought our Kindle. Plus its an easy download and free. Can't complain about free!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I truly enjoyed this Trilogy.  When enough time has passed...I will probably read it again.  As a woman, it can take you out of the small box you tend to stay in.
0446572985|5.0|I am reading this book right now and cannot put it down!  It's classic David Baldacci--fast-paced, interesting, suspenseful...  The main character may not be someone you would like but you can understand why he does what he does.
B009NY43NY|5.0|I will admit this was a quick read. I read the book in a day. I am sad to see the end of this wonderful series but I am looking forward to a new series from Charlaine Harris. Honestly the book ended the way I thought it would. It did seem to be a bit of fluff just to get to the end but after this many books in the series that does not surprise me. I do believe that was Charlaine's way of showing us that she truly is done with Sookie and all her adventures. To everyone that's ticked off at the ending: GET OVER IT! It wasn't your book to write! When you spend as much time on a successful series as she did you would be in the same position. Writer's don't write their stories to please you. Yes they want us to enjoy their books, but what you think should happen isn't the way it's always going to go. The world does not revolve around you or your opinions. As someone once told me \\"Opinions are like a**holes. Everyone has one and they all stink\\"....Even mine.
B009IRVSVQ|5.0|Bought this CD based off of Locked Out of Heaven and fell in love. I could listen to this all day and it wouldn't get old. Highly recommend you go to a concert if you can..amazing
B00CHIMG6Y|5.0|Phenomenal movie! For the first time I understood what it was like to have been in Thailand during the Tsunami. This story is difficult to watch...while also absolutely beautiful.
B00AZM7IQC|5.0|Loved it! We saw 3 Cirque Du Soleil shows in Las Vegas in February 2013 and this is a great piece for us to have as a reminder. I highly recommend this Blu-ray 3D movie for a glimpse into the wonderful and amazing world of Cirque Du Soleil.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is pretty fun . What you do is you pick your character.Then you press the play button.Then you use your finger to go left or right.Well that's all.Hope you get this game.
B005Q1W10A|5.0|Wonderfully written.  Fantastically acted.  Makes you want it to go on and on.  I love it and would hihlt recommed it.
B00B6QXN56|5.0|What can anybody say about Joe that has not already been said. To hear these songs in there acoustic form makes you stop an wonder why they were ever done any other way. Don't get me wrong I love the songs in electric form, but they are so much better acoustic. I bet anybody that was the first time a wash board was ever played in the Vienna Opera House.
B005DJGMQE|5.0|We've all read history book accounts of the civil war and the assassination of Lincoln in school, so I didn't have high expectations of this film. Same old-same old...right? WRONG! Robert Redford told the story in a fresh new way that was enlightening and provocative. Characters were believable and well-developed. The story was free of \\"holes\\" - you know, those irritating pieces in some films that don't make sense. This story worked, and the acting was remarkable. This riveting film is worth watching!
B004SBQGHS|5.0|I am so happy not having advertisements  when I play Angry Birds! This was worth paying for just for that reason alone.
B00355L2TU|5.0|I started this workout as a &#34;New Year's Resolution&#34; because I have hated exercise for years but I thought, &#34;Surely I can get through a 20 minute workout&#34;. Well, I love her 3-2-1 (Strength - 3 minutes, Cardio - 2 minutes, Abs - 1 minute) program. You can do anything for 3 minutes! I've developed muscles where I hadn't had them before. And my endurance for running is so much better due to the workouts. I haven't started Level 2 yet but I am going to do it soon.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|This game is pretty fun.What you do is pick what kind of level you want.Then you shout the angry birds to knock down the buildings.Well that's all.Hope you get this game.
B00ALYY6ZA|4.0|I was already doing IF because I started after seeing Michaels doc in August 2012.  I just wanted all the facts and extra info in writing.  For me this is the only way to lose weight permanently.  I never believed in long periods of calorie restriction.  I have seen in just doesnt work and is not worth all the effort and suffering !  The more people read this, the better. The food industry will do anything to keep this information from spreading but thanks to the BBC, Michael Mosely and all of the scientists and volunteers it is finally getting to the general public !
B005PK57NU|5.0|Love that it's still exciting after a few years.  Not overworked yet.  And the legal issues and loopholes are fascinating.
B008Y73940|5.0|One of the best legal thrillers I have seen or read in a very long time. Matthew McConaughey was brilliant. Characters were well developed and realistic. The story had enough twists and turns to keep you on the edge of your seat. I highly recommend seeing this one!
B009NY43NY|2.0|Charlaine Harris writes good stories, and this was an okay story. I was not happy with the ending nor with the loose ends that were glossed over and not tied up or explained.
B005LAIII0|5.0|I read the book before I saw the film. Usually movies from books disappoint me but this one didn't It caught me from the very first scenes.Very moving, and of course, I loved Richard Parker!Movie
B00CFOXBX2|2.0|I really tried to suspend disbelief and enjoy this film, but the story is so implausible to the point of being just stupid. It doesn't matter who the cast is, if the characters don't act like humans.
B007HNFHCY|5.0|Like everyone has been saying, there is lots of boobs and violence. Great show! Can't wait to watch season's 1 & 2.
B00006JIA4|5.0|How could any one forget this great group? Awesome music and a wonderful addition to my ever growing cd collection.
B00530FC6O|5.0|Very delightful Wodehouse book.  Followup to Right Ho Jeeves.  Not quite as much fun as Right Ho, but still I enjoyed visiting again with old friends.
155890641X|5.0|Bought this for my 19 year old daughter who claimed she never saw &#34;Snow White&#34;! We just watched it together now that she is home from college for the summer. The VHS was in perfect condition and arrived earlier than predicted.
B000OVLBFS|5.0|A very laid back role for Mr Tom Selleck. Love the slower pace of this show. I own all episodes.
B007VTUYWW|4.0|Fast pace action with a excellent story and a number one actress for the part at the time it was made
B00BMKDTNC|4.0|A lot of people are harsh critics because of the change in Authors.  The thing is, if you've read the others, you will read this one.  The writing style is different from Jordan's, so keep an open mind when picking this up.<br /><br />The only qualm I have is the liberal use of tacky idioms that accomplished novelists are better off avoiding.  When Matrim is &#34;burning the midnight oil&#34;, the phrase doesn't fit in the world Jordan has worked so hard to create.  I feel ripped from the setting when these pop up; it feels lazy.
B000002GVO|5.0|Wow! Talk about bring back memories. The Eagles are awesome. The songs and music are so clear. so much better than the 45's etc...
B0000524E5|5.0|My whole family loves this movie.  There's something for the ladies and something for the gents.  Fun movie!  I recommend this to everyone!
B004ZRV3AU|4.0|This takes some practice, but the tool works as expected. Just don't expect that you first couple of attempts are going to turn out perfect.  Use some bottles you don't care to mess up on for the first few tries.  The only issue I have with it is that it's difficult to actually score the glass evenly.  It's very hard to keep a consistent pressure all the way around.
B00BQ1DBUS|5.0|I received my cd \\"time\\" yesterday. I must say this is the best cd that I have listened to in a very long time. all the songs in my opinion are great. some of the songs remind me of the sounds of rod steward from when he started back in the early \\"70's. the cd tells stories of his life. to me its like an autobiography set to music. the last song on the cd actually brought me to tears. thank rod for this great cd!
B007XWFZSA|5.0|It helps a lot.<br />i am new in this field, this book makes me a solid start to get ready for cases.
B004XJRQUQ|2.0|I am an avid reader and consider myself a decent writer/speaker, as well.  After watching the first movie in this series I was intrigued and eagerly picked up the trilogy to dig into the details that the big screen missed.  What I found was very disappointing.<br /><br />The writing style is so horrible that I couldn't get past chapter two.  The sentence structure is repeated and varies very little, and the descriptive techniques may as well be absent.  She focuses on the most mundane of information and moves on suddenly; it seems a poor attempt at immersing the readers in her world.  If you know what &#34;show; not tell&#34; is, then know that this is the complete opposite.  I have to say that this is one of the rare cases where the movie greatly outshines the novel.  I still eagerly await the coming films, but have no plans to read past chapter two.
B000E9910W|5.0|I had forgotten how good this band was. A great addition to my cd collection. I have been playing it in the cd player in the car since I got it.
B00A83075M|5.0|My kids are all grown but we still LOVE watching &#34;Kids'&#34; movies!  We got it quickly and we've loved since!
B007GCY8FS|4.0|not his best but I enjoyed the read.  Just what you&#34;d expect from Reacher, smart, tough and righting the wrongs.
B000SGSU58|5.0|Connely never disappoints, always puts his all in the book, no shortcuts, little filler, intriguing plots , subplots and twists...the whole package
0694003611|5.0|This was my first choice in books to give at friends whom are expecting. This was one of favorite bedtime books as a child and I plan to read it to mine own one day. Happy to pass it on to the next generation of little ones.
B003EY7JH6|5.0|As I fan of Isaac Asimov,I knew of this series of books. I decided to finally read it and it was as good a book as one would expect from him. I only wish I'd read it previously. And not only had I read this book,but I am reading all the rest in the series. And I'm doing it in the order the series timeline.
B002Q7JYPC|5.0|I had not heard these songs and after watching a showtime documentary and hearing bits and pieces I wanted to hear them all. Another plus for my cd collection.
1558908846|5.0|The original Judge Dredd was pretty cool.  When the &#34;new&#34; version came out, our family decided to buy the original since we enjoy it so much.
B000GCFG7E|4.0|Enjoyed the book.  It's always hard to put it down and turn out the light once I started reading it.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|Told in his own words, this is an honest and open account of the motivation, challenges, and successes of Chris Kyle's personal and military experience.  Throughout the book, his wife's reflections add invaluable credibility.<br /><br />Due to the absolute honesty regarding the missions, leadership,  political issues, constant battle of good vs. evil is validated.<br /><br />Individuals like Chris, who are &#34;born&#34; to be in this profession are absolutely necessary for the common sense protection of<br />those who are victims of repression, here and throughout the world!<br />Written prior to his sudden death, this book is a tribute to his family, friends and a triumph for Chris Kyle.
B0050DZN4K|5.0|I was sad to learn Google was ending Reader. I did what several million other Reader users did and easily transferred my subscriptions to Feedly. So far I'm satisfied with the switch.
193700788X|1.0|I used to look forward to the month of May because it used to mean that another SVM novel was coming out, and I got to know more about what was going to happen to characters I had grown to care about. After reading Dead Ever After, I don't think I'll be sad to see them go, not with the poor treatment they got from Harris.<br /><br />I feel like fans of the series are rightfully disappointed. I think fans of the pairing at the end of DEA should feel robbed of a romantic storyline that they are owed. To me, that romantic endgame felt shoehorned in with the bluntest of instruments. It's fine that Harris was so open about who Sookie wasn't going to end up with, but it would have been nice if she had spent time laying some groundwork to that end. The progression on that development was disjointed, instead of A-B-C it went A-B-W-Z.<br /><br />I've had some good times with Sookie and co, but those good times ended around book 8. This book, Dead Ever After, is the weakest in the series, followed closely by its predecessor Deadlocked.
B0007Y89ZM|5.0|I saw the showtime documentary and had to have this to watch over and over again.  My friends have borrowed it and enjoyed it as well.
0375851569|5.0|Perfect book for a 6 year old boy whose starting his reading travel through the ages. Couldn't have chosen a better set of books.
B001NLL8LA|4.0|One of the most consistent characters I read. Predictable but that's ok because the story holds one's attention as it unfolds.
B002FQOI0A|5.0|This book would be good for kids 12-13 and up because it is an awesome book with only little confusion for me. It amazed me because it had been a bit of an action book and had a lot of cool parts in it. I've read it three or four times  because it's such a great book.Read it to find out how great it actually is :)
B007J4T2G8|1.0|This is a Twilight fan fiction knock off not worth the paper it is printed on. This does an injustice to the Stephanie Meyer work it is so obviously based on. I have zero problem with BDSM - I love me some smut, but the female character is written so poorly, making ridiculously stupid decisions, even for a 19 year old virgin, that I couldn't get passed this moronic point of view to try and enjoy the plot...whatever that was.<br /><br />Grey was written fairly interestingly, but he's no different than the 100 other male characters that are run-of-the-mill in this genre.<br /><br />I'll never get back these few hours of reading this...story.
193700788X|2.0|Ok,  I've been an avid fan of this series for very long and I'm so happy to have this disaster of a series finished.  I knew going in who Sookie would end up with but I was hoping I was wrong or a new stronger character was written in.Unfortunately Harris didn't come through. The author ended that relationship by having Erik  try to keep Sookie on the side and paint him selfishly so Sookie wound dump him and eventually run to Sam were typical. But the author really angered me when Harris wrote in steps that Erik took to safeguard Sookie to only write that it was strategic to make a point Freyda. when to safeguard Sookie when he  left was g her were really confusing. to me this series ended in book 8 when she was happy with him. For Harris to say Sam was always her HEA and than write Sookie at the end saying if it didn't work out she would be ok isn't fair. She made it so we would by the companion book to see what happened with her and Sam is so offensive to me that I vow I will never be buy another book from Harris again.  I find that the author was too greedy and kept a series going because it was lucrative, she did not have her fans in mind.
B00092ZMDY|5.0|Sure wish I had seen them in person. Awesome group and I feel they are better the second time around.
B0047Y0FGY|4.0|An intelligent, smart woman writing a really good entertaining book about a bit of her life, and a lot of what goes behind the camera on TV.  SNL, 30 Rock.  If she was a writer for SNL, the brain behind 30 Rock and most of all was able to REAAALLY overshadow and be even better than Ms. Palin one can expect only the best. And that's what one gets: the best
B000QCQ8Y4|4.0|I always enjoy Reacher's ability to cut to the chase, mete out justice and move on.  If it were only so simple !
B009UX2YAC|5.0|this game is so fun and addicting I can't stop playing it and I got 95 thousand coins in 4 days that's how addicting it is
B000U0O9FM|4.0|I couldn't read this book without hearing Edward Norton's voice as the narrator. The concept is amazing, the writing superb.  I can't really add anything that hasn't already been said about this title. The ending was certainly different, than the movie and just what I was expecting, but Palahniuk is an exceptional writer and I really enjoyed this book.
B0063M22QO|3.0|THAT ABOUT SAYS IT ALL, I ENJOY THE GAME.  SOME OF THE TILES ARE A LITTLE DIFFICULT TO FIND, NOT SURE WHAT THE MATE IS BUT IT IS OKAY.
193700788X|1.0|I waited so long for this final chapter in Sookies life.  Since it was to be the last in the Southern Vampire Series, I was so hoping Ms. Harris would do a bang up job.  She didn't.  Not at all!  It was horribly written, so awful, so boring, and so disappointing. I had told my Son this book was on my wish list, that I had all 12 previous \\"Sookie\\" novels, and I asked for Dead Ever After for my Mothers'Day gift.  I got it from Amazon on May 10th by mail, and couldn't wait to read it.  I finished it in 10 hours, but it was a painful 10 hours.  I kept waiting for the story to pick up, but it just dragged on mundane dribble and meaningless stuff.  In the end Sookie sort of ended up with who I had hoped she would from the beginning, but Ms. Harris just slaughtered the character she ended up with, sucking out his entire personality.  And she totally destroyed the other characters in a sloppy, unimaginative way.  It was truly awful reading, and the only reason I did read it through, cause my son paid good money for it.  Like so many others, I too have to say, I won't be buying anymore of Ms. Harris's future works of writing, not even the stupid \\"After Dead\\" the Coda following Dead ever after, which I can't believe she is even putting out.  It only proves Ms. Harris is only out to pick our pockets and try to squeeze the last dime out of Sookie fans.  Won't be buying that book, already reserved it at Library. I think we all could have written a better finale for Sookie, Eric, Bill and all the Bon Temps characters.
B00129H7VS|5.0|I first saw this series when I was overseas for Iraqi Freedom. As soon as I made it home I bought it onDVD. This is like my Star Wars. Every time it comes out with something new I have to get it. This is a must for you WWII buffs.

B00003CX96|5.0|This movie is great.  I purchased them for an IU golf scramble prize during The Little 500.  I suggest this movie to anyone that had never been to the Little 500.
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|Ms. McKenna managed to imbibe what could have been a terribly gloomy story with a tasteful amount of humor. I truly liked the main characters in the story and was concerned for them every step of the way. She created a rich backdrop for her story. I can honestly see this being made into a film.
B003TSEL7S|5.0|Rick Riordan has created a masterpiece. Although this book is a sequel to Percy Jackson, those who are new will enjoy just as much. The book is well-paced, and the end of every chapter makes you want to keep reading. The book is a fabulous mix of action and fantasy, being focused on Greek Mythology.<br />If you have not checked out other works by Rick Riordan, I highly advise doing so.

B003R4ZMNQ|5.0|I didn't start watching this tv show until season 2.  The 1st season was great and helped make sense as to how the show developed in season 2.  The original Hawaii Five-O was a good show and this version is just as good.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Review by #minibabe at [...]<br /><br />The Fault in Our Stars is the newest book John Green has written and was the first one that I had read. It had been circulating through my high school like the plague and everybody was raving about how spectacular it was, so I thought I'd give it a go. In the beginning of the book you're introduced to Hazel, the protagonist of the novel, who sets the mood to the average teenaged mind set. Everything is boring as hell (yes, we do think this quite often). But there is something different about Hazel; she is sixteen years old and she has Thyroid cancer in her lungs. This basically means her lungs fail at being lungs and she has to carry an oxygen tank wherever she goes. Hazel's mother believes Hazel to be depressed since she spends %60 of her life laying in bed and doing nothing and the other %40 thinking about death. Her doctor agrees which results in her medication being adjusted and having to go to a cancer support group. During one of the cancer support group meetings she meets Augustus Waters, the incredibly good looking ex-basketball player and amputee. At first she doesn't want to pursue a relationship with him because she wants to hurt the least amount of people as possible with her inevitable death. Hazel eventually gives in and a beautiful love story unfolds.<br /><br />SPOILER ALERT: You are going to cry. A lot.<br /><br />I knew I was going to cry because everyone who read it told me they cried but I didn't expect to cry as much as I did. The worst part was I was currently 30,000 ft. in the air on an airplane sitting next a stranger when I started crying. Not fun. Anyways let's get back to the book, shall we?<br /><br />This book can be a life changer if you make it which honestly you should because the way that Hazel sees things is so different than anything I've seen. Her way of thinking is quirky at times and almost philosophical at others. One of the best things about this novel is that it gets you thinking abouta lot of things. It gets you thinking about life, death, human nature, hope and love. My favorite kinds of novels are the ones that change the way I see the world and I can honestly say this one absolutely did.<br /><br />The writing style of this book is easy to follow and comical at many different points. Also I would like to applaud Mr. Green for this is the first book of his that is written in a girl's perspective and he nailed it.<br /><br />All in all, this book was a literary masterpiece in my opinion. I would definitely recommend to teens and adults as a must read. Any of John Greens books are a must read.<br /><br />I hope you enjoyed my very first book review and don't forget to be awesome.
B00CQ3SUAQ|5.0|Hannibal is an utter gem. The casting is perfect, the cinematography, sets, and costuming are incredible, the atmosphere is haunting and dreamlike. It's clear that everyone involved in the production of Hannibal takes enormous pride in their work; it's one of those shows where everything onscreen is there for a reason, and every tiny detail is chosen precisely.<br /><br />Other pluses? I'm not used to seeing this many women in leading roles, especially for a show which centers around a relationship between two men (Hannibal and Will), and it's really refreshing to see so many female characters given weight without being victimized or sexualized. The gender ratio is excellent. Also, the dialogue is fantastic - like a lot of things in Hannibal, it's a little strange and a bit poetic, without getting pretentious or obscure. It simply contributes to the atmosphere.<br /><br />Finally, it's genuinely scary. It doesn't go in for cheap suspense, and it has an unconventional format for a crime show, but between the bizarre, artistic murders and Will's sometimes loose grip on reality, Hannibal has a nightmare vibe. Hannibal himself, fantastically portrayed by Mads Mikkelsen, circles the rest of the characters like a shark, never revealing his true nature.<br /><br />Hoping against hope that this show is renewed. It's incredible.
193700788X|4.0|I'm sad to see this series end, but I'm not disappointed with it's conclusion. Charlaine tied up all the loose ends and Sookie is finally making smart choices and choosing what best fits her life. Overall, I'm pleased with this series, and while I can understand the disappointment a lot of fans have, I don't understand how fans have given such horrible reviews and low ratings of this book. I feel that Sookie ended up with the right person, and she didn't have to change who she was to be happy. She just had to realize happiness was right in front of her and be willing to take a chance at a happy life. She made smart choices that I am petty certain will ensure a bright and fulfilling future for her, no matter what other obstacles come her way.<br /><br />For all the haters out there, I'm sorry you have chosen not to enjoy the authors vision and feel that your own vision is how Harris should have ended it. I am just really glad that I don't take this fictitious book as personal and have chosen to enjoy the book for what it offers, not hating it for not meeting my own personal requirements. After all, isn't that what reading is all about; enjoying a fictitious story??
B004GUSG4M|4.0|Good story; definitely makes it hard to put down... But I really wanted to know what happened when she wakes up next...

006074748X|4.0|I love Mary Steward books. This book was the one I read after taking a somewhat large break from reading her stories. It felt different from the books I read before, but I liked it. Magnificent descriptions of nature, interesting characters, mystery, romance and story twists. Made me want to go visit Austria, Germany and see a horse show.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|I love it it's kinda. addictive. and fun to keep up with<br />your always seem to be competiting. with other reefs
B005LAIIHG|5.0|Very artistic and cerebral...This is a movie that is visually stunning and masterfully crafted.  I had read the book, but it was years ago.  There are many subtle nuances in the story, which makes me want to see it again.  The storm scenes are terrifyingly graphic, and evoke the awesome power of nature.  On the other extreme, there are scenes of magical beauty and serenity.  I love the treatment of the three major religions being embraced by the young protagonist.  This was, of course, treated in more depth in the book, and was one of the things I particularly liked about the book.  This is a memorable movie,  a treat for the senses and the mind.
B00CQ1YJKI|5.0|I HAVE REALLY ENJOYED THIS SEASON, LOVE THE OLD SHERLOCK MOVES, BUT THIS IS A GREAT SPIN OFF IN THE NEW AGE OF A YOUNG SHERLOCK & THE YOUNG WATSON HAVE BEEN A REAL JOY TO WATCH THIS SEASON, HOPE IT GOES FOR A LONG TIME!

B008ZOHCKE|2.0|I don't know I may just be dumb but this app is exactly what I was looking for and thought I was going to love it until I started to use it. The biggest disappointment is when you've been typing out a note, especially a really long one, go on to the next page and when you go back to the previous page all your work is gone.

B0037KMHRY|4.0|I used to stream this album from Youtube while I was working on involved task. Made you feel like you were in the movie. Didn't appreciate how good this album was until I heard it the first time with noise canceling head phone instead of speakers. If you love bass in your music.....this album doesn't disappoint. Solar Sailor is my best cut on the album.
0143113100|3.0|I found the book interesting, but somewhat too long.  In addition, the undercover investigation on Taub's monkey lab can be viewed at peta.org Search for Silver Spring Monkeys.  There is extensive video on the monkeys, their injuries, and their living conditions. The picture referred to in the book is also there.
B00A81MV3U|1.0|Thinking positive is a result of cultural conditioning or from positive things happening, they do not cause healthy behavior.  Thoughts are effects NOT causes.  Stop telling us thinking positive helps anyone.  Manipulate contingencies to make people feel good and shape effective humanism.  There is no self initiating force in the universe, much less the brain.  Thoughts have never caused human behavior so shut up and stop making movies as ignorant as Silver Linings Playbook! We have thoughts and they are effects produced by interactions with the environment. Thoughts are side effects.  They are not causes for behavior.  Nobody has ever seen a thought cause behavior, never, they are only said to be causes of behavior because they are paired with behavior at times and that is coincidental reinforcement, superstitious behavior AND superstitious behavior causes problems.  Causes happen 100% of the time.  People many times think they are going to go upstairs and go downstairs, sometimes they just sit there.  Thus, thoughts are superfluous.  Evolution could never select a thought to cause behavior for every situation, not only that natural selection couldn't select a different thought as thoughts are unique according to every individuals unique conditioning, there is no evidence thoughts cause behavior and undeniable evidence that they don't cause behavior.  Humans behave because of their environmental history, evolutionary history and the current situation. NOT descriptions. People behave the way they do regardless of what they think.  How many times does a person say he will not engage in sex and thinks it is a sin, but does so if presented with the opportunity. I mean, causes have to happen 100% of the time and anyone can talk of an example where a persons thoughts were the opposite of their behavior.  Please stop regurgitating your superstitious assertions, they are counter productive to improving the human condition.<br /><br />People behave according to six causes:<br /><br />1. Genetic Endowment<br />2. Pre-natal chemical environment<br />3. Post-natal chemical environment<br />4. Pavlovian Conditioning: stimulus-stimulus-response<br />5. Skinnerian Conditioning: stimulus-response-consequence<br />6. Traumatic factors<br /><br />These causes for behavior work through generalization, discrimination, avoidance behavior, punishment, positive reinforcement, negative reinforcement, etc....  Human behavior is complicated, but there are real world variables that determine behavior NOT thoughts.  You sheople that continue to regurgitate superstitious rhetoric like behavior is caused by thoughts are ruining any chance we have of understanding human behavior.  Learning to manipulate real world variables is the only behavior that will allow us to be healthy and happy!  SO, stop making ignorant movies like Silver Linings Playbook and stop continuing to reinforce superstition that perpetuates problems!
B00004Y6NX|5.0|Solid album.  Probably their most melodic effort complimented with a couple rockers.  Great texture.  A candidate for their best album.
B008Q00BOQ|2.0|Didn't like it. Probably will be the only one to say that, I suppose the action was alright but this wasn't my kind of movie. Will not be watching anymore of them.
B009UX2YAC|3.0|My grandson downloaded this game for him, 6 years olds. He says he likes it, it's fun, fast and sometimes he messes up :).
B00CQWA4LU|2.0|The premise of the show had potential, yet it talks down to the audience. Unfortunately, I bought the series. Hopefully people will wise-up and see that it is trash from what it easily could be.<br /><br />Just ask yourself about some of the choices in character personality and dialogue ... it is just about stereotypes: over the top gay, military man, angry and rude black cop, soccer mom.  Why are people thinking that this is good?<br /><br />This is the sub-ordinary, low-quality norm for American television with mostly Canadian or Brit actors serving up their least effort for us, hoping that we will buy anything as usual.<br /><br />Either they improve 300% (after episodes 6 + 7) or hopefully get cancelled.
B005GSZZ1A|5.0|The book had me hooked from the very beginning, read it in a day, what an eye opening experience to what's going on in North Korea.
B009AMAGQM|3.0|The films strongest attributes were the few good supporting actors that somehow got stuck in this monster of a film. The lead plays a southern high school boy, but his southern accent is terrible--most of them were, save those few good ones mentioned before.<br /><br />What really drew me to this film was my fascination with witches and magic. It's a coolish story, but it has the obvious feel of teen fiction (it lacks the structure and reality of adult fiction). The story is inconsistent at times; the setting and background characters are complete stereotypes that are overdone.<br />Furthermore, at the core of the story is an obnoxiously sexist premise that men don't have to worry about turning evil, but girls do because they lack the control of men.<br /><br />It also plays on this idea that one must be all good or all bad, but to be fair, it seemed to end with this idea that she was a bit of both.<br /><br />So, bad acting, bad philosophy, plot holes in a coolish story, it all makes for a disappointing watch overall. I did expect a little bit more but not much. I wouldn't recommend it; I don't even know why I passed up superior films that I need to watch. Oh wait, I do, I have a thing for magic and witches and what not, so if you're like me and can look past all its faults, go ahead and give it a go. It isn't as bad as twilight.<br /><br />UPDATE<br /><br />I would like to reiterate the painfully dreadful accent of the actor who plays Ethan. It was almost unbearable and completely in-genuine.

0859531368|3.0|A friend gave us an 'Old McDonald' book by the same company and each page is hard cardboard so the holes are very obviously revealed with the turn of a page.  This book is flimsy soft pages found in a normal book with holes but they barely reveal themselves so my 14 month old can't really distinguish without a lot of help that something 'new' has been revealed.  She likes it but loves the other book.  So I have to some how see if the company makes a less flimsy version of its books with holes anymore.  The other book was given to her by a friend whose daughter used it 15 years ago.

B003M6P2LG|4.0|This show had so much potential in the first season. It questioned the accepted nature of consciousness and identity, explored multiplicity in regards to identity, presented the benefits and drawbacks of technology in an unbiased manner, and had excellent actors. Unfortunately it degenerated into yet another science is evil piece of media by the end of the second season.<br /><br />The progressive nature of the show's ideas is what kept me watching the first season. Given advances in brain computer interfaces, wearable computers, and cloud computing it is plausible that all people could become interchangeable and free of their physical limitations within the century. In this regard the show's examination of consciousness and identity could prove to be pretty accurate to how things might end up playing out minus the dependence on physical bodies. This is the main reason the first season appealed to me so much.<br /><br />Throughout the first season the writers seemed to show how the technology could be abused but also how the benefits could outweigh the potential drawbacks. The season was very unbiased in that characters presented valid and rational arguments both for and against technological progress.<br /><br />The second season was nothing like this. The writers seemed to make a small attempt to imply that perhaps the \\"good guy's\\" overwhelming idealism may have been what caused the technology to get out of control in the first place. However by the end of the season the show as a whole seemed to completely adopt a Luddite philosophy of returning to the old ways of good old fashioned work and learning because technology is inherently evil... *sigh*<br /><br />Maybe the writers wouldn't have gone this route if SyFy hadn't canceled the show (Darn you SyFy). Given the show's impending end the writers may have decided that this was the best and most dramatic way to conclude it.<br /><br />As a whole the show is more than worth watching for both of its opposing technological sentiments (mainly in the first season), it's exploration of identity, and it's great cast and acting. It's too bad SyFy canceled the show because the writers may have otherwise decided on a direction more true to the first season.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|One of the great things about sci-fi is the way it lends itself to the human story in galaxies far, far away...or in the silo next door. I bought this omnibus on the recommendation of a friend and am so glad I did. Superlative writing replete with societal symbolism, mounting tensions and unexpected twists, and a human tale that resonates deep down is all contained in WOOL...and is what the genre is all about. I'm looking forward to when this self-published author is nominated for the Hugo. Until then, I'll keep reading his work.
B008AK8FHM|4.0|This book was so credible!  I have always been a believer, and this simply confirmed what I already knew.  Good job, Dr. Alexander!  Thank you for writing this book.
B00BWBHIUG|4.0|fun app, very pretty graphics, a little hard to advance without spending real money game definitely encourages this. not sure I would recommend for children who might constantly want to buy sanddollars, alge and pearls to speed up game. pretty slow without buying them.

B0068LYEHA|1.0|Wow! I really disliked this book. Proclaimed to be a hilarious view of being a feminist in today's world I didn't laugh once. I didn't even chuckle. I was bored and found this book vulgar and that is something I rarely say. I don't know if I'm too old for the target audience, but having lived through the fledgling days of the struggle for women's rights my only thought was \\"Is that all there is\\"?  Disappointing is an understatement. This book has been compared to Tina Fey's Bossypants, which is an insult to Tina Fey.

1451695195|5.0|What an amazing journey!  Dr. Alexander's detailed, articulate expressions were priceless!  How he put it all together, weaving the history of his illness with what went on in his mind--and beyond--was incredibly well done.  I've recommended this book to simply everyone.  They are profoundly touched by his message as well.  It's simply a must read for every human being on our planet.
B0097EWK3A|4.0|This is definitely one of the best games I have played. Fun and entertaining. Dialog is a little cheesey but that is minor. No glitches and hardly any spiders! Why do all ho games have to have spiders? I know it is just animation but ick! Only saw one or two in this one.  Have fun!

B00008PX8P|5.0|I've had the Led Zeppelin DVD for 3 days now.  But I haven't managed to get to disc 2 (yet)! The reason is that I am just so blown away by disc 1.  Well actually, I haven't managed to finish it either because I am so stuck on the 1969 Danish TV performance!  Wowwwwwwwwwwwwww!!!!<br /><br />It is hard to believe that the band was new at that time.  The maturity that they display, not to mention the raw talent, is nothing short of remarkable!!!!  Robert is singing several octaves lower than normal and boy does it work!  The fact that he started out singing the blues shines as bright as the sun especially in \\"Dazed and Confused\\" and (my new personal favorite) \\"How Many More Times\\".<br /><br />One of the best parts is the absolute beautiful quality of the black and white film.  Moreover, it's a very tight set so you really get to see everyone perform.  For everyone who has complained about not seeing John Paul Jones during performances - watch this clip!!! You get to see him rocking out and dancing.  And you really get a feel for how important his bass lines are to the band! The clip also captures the power of John Bonham.  I am still wondering how he beat those drums so hard without breaking them.<br /><br />And Jimmy!  Well what can I add to a discussion about the master?  Only that this black and white clip has some great shots of him rocking out.  Which brings me back to Robert: oh my god!!!! The emotion that he lets loose for this small group of teenagers is nothing short of INCREDIBLE!  He feels the music and makes you feel it too.  I particularly like his moves at the beginning of \\"How Many More Times\\".  After introducing the band, it's as if the music takes over and he really starts move and he does NOT stop!!! Another great version of \\"How Many More Times\\", although I'll admit I have never met a Zeppelin version of this song that I did not loveeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee! How many more times indeed... I've watched this clip at least a 100 times so far!<br /><br />Prior to watching this DVD I didn't even like \\"Communication Breakdown\\" now I'm loving it!  \\"I can hear it calling me...\\" so I'll wrap up by saying a little about the main portion of the disc.  I haven't yet allowed the disc to play past my obsession, but it starts out with a kickass version of \\"We're Gonna Groove\\".  At first glance it seems like Janis Joplin has returned to the stage.  Robert sings with the intensity and emotion of Joplin in this concert.  He is so young, and actually looks younger than he did in the 1969 Danish clip where he is dressed in an uncustomary formal shirt AND jacket (it was probably the last time he that many clothes!).  And except for a few smiles he is fairly serious and focused in the Danish clip.  But in the 1970 concert he lights up like a happy kid doing what he loves!  He shares smiles big enough to match his hair!  Robert's voice cannot be heard as clearly in this film, but still the performances are outstanding.<br /><br />Anyway, best $20 I've spent in a long time!  I'd buy it again just for the 1969 clips.  I hope to put disc 1 down at some point and see what is on disc 2.  If it is anything like disc 1, I know I will have a whole lotta love!!!!!!!!!!!!Prior to watching this DVD I didn't even like \\"Communication Breakdown\\" now I'm loving it!  \\"I can hear it calling me...\\" so I'll wrap up by saying a little about the main portion of the disc.

B000ICXQXS|4.0|The Sting is a great old classic movie with Redford & Newman teamed up. I will say however that every single Amazon instant movie I have rented glitches up and I have to reset it mid movie. I find this ultra annoying. The last three movies I have vowed not to rent on Amazon again. I think this time I will stick to my decision however convenient their extensive library of titles is. My son agreed to help me find other online movie distributors so I can find the titles I want elsewhere.

B005HJWWW8|5.0|I am reviewing the AKG K242 along with the FiiOE6.<br /><br />I plugged-in this power hungry 91 db AKG unit to my ipod's headphone jack  and as expected from the AKG's specs and the notoriously bad equalization of the Apple Touch Ipod, sound produced was very restrained.  A number of users warned of this so I ordered my AKG with an inexpensive EiiO6 headphone amp.<br /><br />The K242 delivered 300% better at line level boosted by EiiO E6 portable headphone amp.  With this low cost combination, program material was freed IPod's wimpy built in equalizer.  The AKG K242's great potential has been tapped for portable use!!<br />I also own a Grado SR80i which is more efficient at 99 db and am happy to report that it also greatly benefits from the amp.<br /><br />The AKG plays loud enough out of Sony Walkman MP3 and the sound quality is good straight from device.  However, I bet it will sound better at line level + FiiO6 + L5 Line Out Dock (LOD) Cable For Sony Walkman.  I can't wait for my order (I am getting another EiiOE6 for it)<br /><br />Some may complain about the AKG K242's  10 foot chord but a belt clip GPS case solved the mobility issue.  I walked 5 miles yesterday with the entire package - AKG, EiiO6, L9 LOD in the GPS case and it was bliss!!<br /><br />The EiiO6 manufacturer's claim of 10 hours use per charge is true for this brand new unit.  It took approx 45min-1 hour to charge from a USB port.  I wonder how long the lithium battery will last ... anyway I am endorsing this model because of its performance and low replacement cost.

0525952926|5.0|A couple of years ago I read my first Ken Follett book Fall of Giants, and I loved it. It's the first book in his \\"Century\\" trilogy and it follows the lives of five families, each from different key countries in the world during World War I and the Russian Revolution. In Winter of the World Follett picks things up a few years later and this time tells the story of the lives of the next generation of those same families beginning with the events leading up to World War II and ending with the start of the Cold War.<br /><br /> I really enjoyed this book; as much, if not more than I did the first one. Follett does an excellent job of using the lives of these families to describe what it would have been like to live during such a pivotal and historical time. He describes life in Germany during Hitler and the Nazi Party's control, London during the blitz, as bombs were dropped nightly for months at a time, and Pearl Harbor on the morning of December 7, 1941.<br /><br /> Once again I am amazed at the level of research Follett is doing in order to write these books. He doesn't just use historical events to tell his story, he inserts his characters into those events. They interact with historical figures like Churchill and FDR. They work on developing a world-changing type of bomb. And they help tell the story of history in an entertaining, compelling, and enlightening way.<br /><br /> At the end of next year Follett will complete his trilogy with Edge of Eternity. I'm looking forward to it and am confident it won't disappoint.

0321701763|3.0|The book is good and required if taking a class. What I didn't like was that it don't give you any short cuts as to how to get the job done! What I mean is it takes you a long time to do things in several steps that can actually be done in a simplier form. and half the time!
0783240287|5.0|The first time I saw this, it was on the stage - and, I did not want to go.  After I saw it, I knew that I had to get a copy of it.  It is a wonderful example of a classic Bible story that can lift you up.  While I was going through a very difficult divorce, I watched it countless times.  The music is great - each song in a different genre.  And, while it is a Bible story, it is not &#34;preachy&#34;.  It is told with a sense of humor.  And, I think God would like that.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway suffers is one of my favorite games ever. The game is a challenge and sometimes hard. You should get this app.
B00CHIMG6Y|5.0|This movie is amazing.  Great cast.  And a nice performance that shows the power of perseverance and never giving up.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I got it for my son and ended up loving it myself. It is good for any age.<br />It brings me back to my younger days!
B000BFH2S2|5.0|I have many Michael Buble cd's and I find all of his work outstanding. Order it, listen to it and relax. Thanks
B0012X6FR6|5.0|An innovative jazz trio like this may never again grace the jazz scene. This isn't to say that there are no great jazz groups today (I love many of them), but this trio is magical in that the musicians are so in tune with each others' phrasing, harmonies and rhythms contributing to the tune they playing...no egotistical playing going on here!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is a super fun game that is very addicting.... in a good way though !!!! I enjoy playing it with my younger cousins and I encouraged them to get it on their phone. To any other people I highly suggest this game!
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Love the puzzles and environment. I personally say it's worth the price, of course only if you enjoy puzzles and have patience to solve them on your own. :)
B004Q3UL2O|1.0|I have no issue with nudity. I don't even have problems with movies with stricter ratings than \\"R,\\" but sexy is not forced. And the shots of Hathaway's breasts in the first half felt like it was forced and unnatural as product placement.<br /><br />A sad disease becoming central in the second half of the script felt just as forced. It was a meager attempt to make a very silly relationship that will fizz out in a year or two seem epic.<br /><br />At least rom coms unashamedly act like what they are. I don't know what that was, but the movie was as shallow as the characters' supposed love.
B000FBJFSC|4.0|I really enjoyed reading this book but was disappointed in the ending.  It leaves you wondering what happens to Frank.
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|The beginning of the book was slow but necessary in setting up the story for what was to come. Once it picked up, it became very exciting, making you wish there were an OASIS you can log into and play. Or at the very least start playing video games. I think gamer geeks and 80s enthusiasts would most relate to this book but I am neither and still thoroughly enjoyed the book. I teared up at the end. I highly recommend this book for anyone looking to read an exciting adventure.
0767827791|4.0|Picnic is an interesting `slice of life' movie from 1950s small-town America.  In the film Hal Carter (William Holden) hops off a freight train in the small Kansas town hoping to land some work via his college buddy Alan (Cliff Robertson).  But before meeting Alan, Hal bumps into his astonishingly beautiful girlfriend Madge (Kim Novak) while doing some odd jobs for her elderly neighbor (Verna Fenton).<br /><br />Madge's mother is pushing her to quickly marry Alan to improve her social status.  But Madge wants to be loved by someone for more than her beauty. Added to the mix is outspoken boarder Rosemary (Rosalind Russell) and Madge's bookworm/tomboy sister (Susan Strasberg) who frequently quarrels with Madge.<br /><br />Hal quickly makes friends around town and is invited to the annual Labor Day picnic. He takes Madge's sister Mille but keeps one eye on Madge the whole time. As the picnic winds down the romantic overtones heat up - both between Made and Hal, and between Rosemary and confirmed bachelor Howard (Arthur O'Conner). Before long emotions boil over as everyone's feelings of inadequateness and fears over romantic relationships erupt into full fury.<br /><br />I really enjoyed this movie - especially seeing Kim Novak at age 22.  She plays the vulnerable and heartbroken Madge just perfectly. Holden was a bit old (age 37) to be playing a character in his mid 20s, but he was able to pull it off by being extremely physically fit for the film (where he is shirtless nearly half the time).  Rosalind Russell is a bit over-the-top, but adds a dimension about how desperate someone can be to find love.<br /><br />The movie feels a bit like a play (it was based on a play by William Inge) since it all takes place within 24 hours and all in one small town.  However, the down-to-earth scenery, great acting, and raw emotions that are displayed on screen make Picnic worth having in any classic film collection.
B008B8DY2O|5.0|In exploring Shantaram's internal and external journey through the city, slums and villages of India, the reader is also carried through a tide of thought on the beauty, pain and endless substance of life and the lives of the simple and complex characters in this book. Robert's masterpiece offers an epic tale filled with action, drama, humour, romance, philosophy, anthropology, psychology and the list goes on. this is sure to be a classic.
B00992CF6W|5.0|It's an awesome game.There are also many adventures.I like to create things on this game.If you have anything you want to build this is the place to do so. If you get it have fun with it.I definitely recommend this game.
193700788X|1.0|***SPOILERS***<br /><br />This is part of my review for the last book, Deadlocked:<br /><br />\\"If Harris wanted Sookie to be with Sam, she should have done it 11 books ago. Now it's just kind of pathetic.<br /><br />I will read the last book because I'm not going to stop now, but I will be really disappointed if the end of the story is just Sookie hooking up with Sam & Eric going off to be Freyda's consort taking Pam & Bill with him. In other words, we will be right back to where the story started, Sookie working at Merlotte's with nothing going on.\\"<br /><br />It turns out that Bill & Pam are staying, but Sookie & Sam are now together, while Eric is a consort & is leaving forever. We barely even hear from Eric, & he certainly isn't the same strong vampire he was in all the other books. Now he's a plaything for Freyda who goes along with leaving his children (the last book is when CH decides to introduce his other daughter?) and everything he worked for without a backward glance. We hear from Bill more than Eric, but Bill is now portrayed as a friendly neighbor whose relationship with Sookie was never closer than that. Even with those character changes & the lack of vampires in a series that's been about vampires all through the other books, having Sookie end up with Sam after everything she's been through is exactly what I didn't want to happen. Like I said in my Deadlocked review, it should have happened 11 books ago. They were always friends, if they were going to end up together, than CH should have written a lot more romance into their relationship throughout the books instead of just springing it on us in the last book.<br /><br />The style of the book was also different from the other books, for reasons that I can't figure out CH decided to write some parts from the viewpoint of people we don't even know. As for the villains, I found all their motivations to be kind of lame. There were certainly plenty of them, in fact, more than there should be. They fragmented the story & took away from what this book should have been about, Sookie finally coming to terms with her abilities & the supernatural world that she, like it or not, is a part of.<br /><br />I just feel sad that after 13 books, this is how the story ends, it should have been so much better.
B0027MJU00|5.0|I've been out of high school now a very long time, and I have never been someone who loved, or even liked to read and didn't, even when it was ordered as a summer reading book for my grade when school came back around...but maybe maturity, or boredom set in, because I found myself searching for something to pass the time. I had no idea where to even begin to look for something that might peak my interest, or how I should even go about looking, much less finding a novel that was even capable of keeping me wanting to never put down. I LOVED this book, I am amazed by the author, I was intrigued by the characters, captivated by the story , and I have to thank Gillian Flynn for her gift of writing because I read this in only 3 days and wish it didn't end. Thank you for showing me that when a book is this well written, that I CAN love to read!
B00AZMFK3K|2.0|Less lens flares than the first film - Good. Slightly less violent 'shaky cam' than the first film - Good. Actors settling nicely into their roles - Good. Simon Pegg - very good, but Scotty still too much a figure of fun. The Klingon makeup and costumes - excellent: these are an elegant warrior people I'd like to see more of, even if the Trek TV series of the 80's and 90's DID over-use the Klingons. The 'Enterprise' Engineering and bridge sets are still ugly, garish, not ergonomic looking and seem like an OSHA nightmare!! STORY: I thought that the rogue-agent terror plot was a good idea and had far less holes and illogical &#34;WTFs?!&#34; than the first movie. But there were still a couple sequences that didn't make sense - the worst being the 'Enterprise's near-crash. One moment they're orbiting the Moon (400,000kms away), the next - suddenly they're right above the Earth's atmosphere and falling?! And where were other Starships, Ferries, Liners or other vehicles that could give them a tug with tractor beams - only two spaceships in the Earth-Moon system? I don't think so!! Also, I liked it that Kirk got bad kharma for his arrogance and insubordination and that many felt he didn't deserve the Captaincy only three years or so out of the Academy. Even by the end of the first movie he did NOT deserve that Captaincy - he did NOT earn it. And then when 'John Harrison's' true identity was revealed I groaned and did a facepalm - and even more so when Spock screamed 'Harrison's' true name later on in rage!!<br /><br />JJ Abrams and his writers have delivered a spectacular film, one I feel is a slight improvement over the first. But it's impossible for me to overlook its many flaws - not the least of which is the director and writers seeming inability to stop cannibalizing the Star Trek of old. It's like trying to play an old tune in a different key on a shiny new fiddle - but it's still an old tune. The universe of Star Trek has a thousand potential tunes - try and write some new ones, guys...  First film I rate C+plus. 'Into Darkness', I rate C-minus.<br /><br />EDIT: Added salient points - I've noticed that for many years Star Trek movies LOVE TO hang around Earth. Star Trek: TMP - Vejur threatens Earth. Wrath Of Khan - has significant scenes set on Earth. The Search For Spock - has significant scenes set on Earth. The Voyage Home - a threat to Earth and most scenes set there (love the movie, though). The Final Frontier - has significant scenes set on Earth. The Undiscovered Country - has significant scenes set on Earth. Generations - has significant scenes set on Earth. First Contact - a threat to Earth and most scenes set there (love the movie, though). Insurrection: wait for it - HAS NO SCENES SET ON EARTH WHATSOEVER!! Nemesis - has significant scenes set on Earth and the baddie is heading there in his weapon of mass destruction. Star Trek: Reboot AND Nemesis - has significant scenes set on Earth and the baddie is heading there in his weapon of mass destruction. Into Darkness: Bloody planet Earth - AGAIN!!<br /><br />Anyone see a pattern here?! INSURRECTION: Only ONE Star Trek film that has NOTHING to do with planet Earth...ry and write some new ones, guys...  First film I rate C+plus. 'Into Darkness', I rate C-minus.

B002JCSWV6|5.0|What a great movie - an inspiration for all of us.  You'll always remember the forgiving example of Nelson Mandela after watching this movie.
B0083GQ2A0|3.0|The story line and plot were good. But the actual movie could have been more interesting and dramatic. Would watch it again.
B00AS1Q8FW|4.0|a good movie over all. worth the power to run the blu ray player.<br />a guy movie with a very good car chase in it. not a movie to see<br />10 times but that kind of movie is hard to find.
B001NEK2GE|5.0|Really a great piece of hardware which includes an ergonomic approach.<br />Quality of keys is very good and the small joy is easy to operate.<br />Works well with G510 Keyboard
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|I really loved this game.  It was beautifully rendered, and the puzzles were challenging enough to make it worth my while but not so challenging I had to end up resorting to looking for cheats.  I'd definitely buy more games from this company.
B009HV2JT8|5.0|We loved this movie!!! The plot and acting were great. It was an interesting story. It is a great educational tool. It combines something kids love (vampires) with actual historical events. Its a great way to teach history so that they remember it!!!
B00A9X9VAI|3.0|Show up in the future to kill yourself in the past to return yourself to the future of killing yourself in the past? Do I have that right or am I just guessing?<br /><br />I really did not get it or I have it backwards?
B0094K1MH2|4.0|I thought It was a good movie. Worth Watching regardless of your age, I wasn't expecting much but it exceeded my expectations
B00BEJ5O6Q|3.0|Not outstanding, but good beat. Lyrics so-so. There will probably be a few hits in here, and I think the CD is good over all
B00AE9UYJ4|5.0|I get Scared All The Time! Slender Man! - Chapter 1: Alone! Get It, Like<br />Freaking Now! Epic! Get It NOW! Should I Play This Every Day or What!<br />Get Now!
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This book was truly a phenomenal book. I completely loved every part of this novel. I almost feel as if Charlie was a real person. He was such a relatable character. I cried through out so many parts of this book, but it was honestly the best thing I have ever read in my entire life.
B00992CF6W|3.0|This app is wonderful, but twice now my games have been switched from survival mode to creative mode. It is very frustrating! Please fix!!!!!!!
B002MQYOFW|4.0|Read this book shortly after watching the movie. Overall the movie did a great job, but reading the book gives you so much access to Katniss mind. The book is fast paced and relatively short. The story is very straightforward but it's always interesting. Its a great read.
B007AJFSJW|5.0|Anyone that wants to understand the current state it the world's economy and how to fix it will enjoy this book.
B006X5L6VS|1.0|Not a very good app, does not rotate to horizontal view on my tablet. That makes no since at all because even on a phone horizontal would give you a larger view of the sky. Music and sound effects are dumb.<br /><br />I was hoping this could replace both Google Sky and Satellite AR but it has too many dumb features to be used seriously.<br /><br />Google Sky is free and better.
B009NY43NY|4.0|I'm sorry to see this enjoyable series come to an end.  Unlike other reviewers I did feel like most of the characters were true to form.  Just because you're unhappy that things didn't work out the way you hoped doesn't mean a character was drastically different.<br />I really enjoyed getting to revisit some characters from previous books and getting a glimpse of where things will end up.
0307895475|4.0|The book  is amazing- huge, almost all-encompassing. The one thing it isn't is linear. If you're in a sticky spot in-game and are looking for a quick way out, you're probably going to have to hit the 'net. I'm not sorry I bought it. I'm a little sorry I have to read and bookmark the entire book for future reference.
B00AQB2A3I|5.0|Excellent cd by a very underrated performer. Compares to his work in Porcupine Tree. If you have the opportunity to see the tour don't miss it!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|My children love this game! It is so much fun...it is a favorite game in my household! VERY AWESOME GAME!!!!!!

B007PKDW44|5.0|great shipping cd is great love volbeat great CD if you dont like them you suck cause your missing out on a lot of talent here
B009439HEY|5.0|Excellent covers of Genesis songs he originally performed on. I'm looking forward to seeing this tour in the fall. I can't wait!
B003204MQS|5.0|Hey... you've got to give it to these filmmakers.  They did it.  This movie scared people without spending tons of money or doing crazy gags.  It's simple, effective suspense.  No glitz and glammour, but slow paced fun.  I really enjoyed this movie.  I thought it was clever and I really wanted to know what was going to happen at the end.  I like the ending A LOT... I've seen the original ending and i don't think it's as scary.  I always appreciate a great low budget movie that goes up against the big dogs... and wins!
B0053O8AQE|5.0|2 BROKE GIRLS IS SO FUNNY LOVE THE SHOW CANT WATCH THE SHOW WHEN IT COMES ON I WORK THE GRAVEYARD SHIFT KEEP THEM COMING
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|I can't wait to read this with my kids this summer.  It contains a message that I try to teach daily, but I know that August Pullman will be able to stitch it much deeper into their souls.  I love you August...and Via...and Summer...etc., etc., etc!
B003V1WTMM|5.0|Kate Morton creates a world in this book the is both enthralling and frightening. One is transported to the castle and like Saffy you want to escape but like Percy you want to stay. A great read for a rainy day.
B006PERRMY|4.0|I liked this movie.  I really wasn't expecting to for some reason, but it was a nice suprise.  Justin Timberlake gives a great perfomance along with Amanda Siegfred.  This movie had a really clever concept and great stunts.  The writing and cinematography were great, just try not to notice that they use the word \\"Time\\" all the time...<br /><br />I would recommend... a fun flick.
B00AHTYGRW|4.0|Not what I expected, very exciting.  Reminds me of the attack in Bengazi.  Hi suspense, Hi Drama especially toward the end.
193700788X|5.0|To all those hating how this book wrapped up. Charlaine Harris stated with no uncertainty that Sookie would never be made vampire. Her deep friendship and attraction to Sam was established in the very first book and hints were dropped all throughout the series as to just how deep that went, it makes me wonder if those hating this outcome were reading the same books. I and my daughter who enjoy this series both discussed that this would be the outcome more than once. What possible outcome could be had with her staying with Eric, and yes I love that hunk of vampire character like no other, (well except for a certain Jairius and Thea hot sex pairing in another venue) she didn't want to be turned, Eric has eternity in front of him, you do the math. If you want Sookie and Eric together write your own ending since the authors version left such a bad taste in your mouth. She has stated she has no more left to write about Sookie so this wrap up left me bittersweet, but I'd rather see this then have her continue a series that had nothing more left to offer from her perspective.
0894803123|5.0|I make a new batch of ice cream almost every week and I started out using the recipes in this book and have since expanded to experimenting with a multitude of tasty treats inside the ice cream.  My favorite is the sweet cream base #1 and expand from there.<br />It's worth getting to start a wonderful adventure in the wonderful world of ice cream creation.
B005K2YRVG|5.0|This case definitely does the trick. It's made of quality materials and gives excellent protection. When my kindle is in this case, I could literally throw it across the room and not worry that my kindle would break.... not that I've ever done that before.
B00BEZTMWW|5.0|Love the move and I got the 3D version which was really cool.  The music was familiar as well, if you have the lord of the rings collection this is a must have.
B000VYNYN0|5.0|Classic horror.  This is a must for horror buffs. Bruce Campbell is awesome as Ash. Tension runs high in this movie.  Before you watch the new Evil Dead watch the original.  You will not be disappointed.  From possessed girlfriends, cursed books, and a living forest hell bent on tearing out your soul the Evil Dead will keep you on your feet till the end.
B0050DIWFC|3.0|Too much detail to get to a wimpy ending. It was a diappointing read. Here are your six more words
B00AMBLDEE|5.0|exactly the sort of movie I like to watch on a weekend night when I just want plain entertainment yet at a standard I don't find stupid or too mindless
B005LAIIKI|5.0|entertaining from start to finish!  and of course it has all of the over-the-top everything that you would expect from Quentin tarrentino.
B001KZG99A|5.0|I rented this movie because it wasn't available on Netflix instant watch nor was it at redbox. I wanted to be ready for the 3rd Iron Man by having a &#34;Starks&#34; marathon. I was able to get by fix. :)
B000002VMD|5.0|forgot how good this album was and had to go back and see the movie again - and just as gr8 now
B003F3NDWG|5.0|Love the show! I plan to get more! I do not do cable so I had seen episode here and there. knew I liked it enough and now I am hooked!
B00A81NFAS|5.0|I think this was much better than the other academy award nominees.  It is a chick flick essentially but much more entertaining than most other ones I've seen.  Glad we bought it.
B007RCJNDE|4.0|it was better than i had anticipated and an amazing effort to get it all tied up and finished with a pretty good ending
B00992CF6W|5.0|Did you people know that there is a peaceful mode which is survival without all the mobs and monsters. It is much better for people who don't like all that stuff
B001XRLWPQ|5.0|Love the show! I plan to get more! I do not do cable so I had seen an episode here and there. knew I liked it enough and now I am hooked!
B0091REZMW|4.0|Just started playing it and so far so good. I like the different games and such hope it keeps up.
B0079HLDCQ|3.0|not good enough for the price - i've read both these new character books now and i think the author has run out of stories to write or maybe just needs a big rest - neither book is particularly compelling - although they are both well written enough
1451668945|4.0|Nice rainy day/beach book. Good plot but not a keep you up all night/can't put it down read. Interesting characters but I had it figured out before the end of the book. Still worth the read. Always good to escape in a murder mystery.
B00CH87HF4|5.0|Very few real rpgs on devices most have some elements but lake in story.  This has it all combat mixed with; levels, crafting, and story driven adventure.
B005GSZZ1A|5.0|This book was a new experience for me and has allowed me to understand survival. It is amazing how cruel mankind can be to one another.  Then those that have helped show the compassionate side of mankind. I believe there are still labor camps in north Korea and will pray for those held captive. I recommend this book and will never forget what I have learned.
B006C1DH92|4.0|played it on my son's iPhone. so I bought it here on Amazon but can't seem to get it downloaded to my kindle:(
B007SGM084|1.0|This was pure Porn!  I thought I could overlook all the sex and try to find the story line, but that did not happen!  Some things are better left to the imagination!
B002QYSZBO|5.0|Shane black is a director like no other.  His movies have goofy action that is very recognizable.  If you watched iron man 3, then you should know what I'm talking about.  The humor ingrained in every aspect of the movie without seeming out of place is what makes Shane black one of my favorite directors.  Rdj is my favorite actor, so I may be a little bias, but you don't want to miss this hilarious movie.
B00BWBHIUG|4.0|My kids love this game. They like creating together to make Nemo and his friends enjoy their surroundings. We enjoy the colors and graphics. Pretty easy for my 4 year old to understand.
B00881VLCE|4.0|I love magic puzzles!  This product keeps me busy for hours when wifi is not available on my kindle. Great hand eye coordination. Down side...background is way to dark! More contrast is needed. Most puzzles have portions of dark in them. It is impossible to see outdoors. It is difficult to see inside. This simple change would really benifit most of your customers. I'm so frustrated that I pass up puzzles with a lot of dark backgrounds. Put in a background option on your puzzles please! Thanks again for a fun experience. Make that change and I'll rate this 5 stars. P.S. more interesting pictures would be nice. I like the various Country's... need more.
B00A0R0CG0|5.0|I thought this was an excellent movie.  The story line was perfect for children to understand that chosen friends based on looks or how cool they appear to be, doesn't make them good friends or the type of person you would really consider a true friend.<br /><br />Ice Age gets better with each new version.
B00BHMETKC|3.0|This movie was about a great heroic, historic event. I just don't think it was done well enough to warrant all of the attention it got.
B004J4WLB4|4.0|Well I found it hard to get into....such detail about flowers.  But once the real story reveals itself, it's hard to put the book down.  So sad.
B005S9EKCW|5.0|Amazing movie I can't get enough of because the amazing actors that did a wonderful job and it's one of my favorite movies!
B0092ZEIN4|3.0|I bought this to use on my Surface Pro (Windows 8) with some games (mostly Rayman Origins) while traveling. It's small, light and connects via bluetooth so it's very portable.<br /><br />Pros:<br />- Compact<br />- Light<br />- Portable<br />- Bluetooth, easy to connect<br />- Looks nice<br /><br />Cons:<br />- Almost too small (personal preference)<br />- Many of the buttons don't work in HID mode:<br />- - \\"Home\\" button always launches a web browser<br />- - D-pad is mapped to keyboard arrow keys instead of the normal joystick d-pad<br />- - Right analog stick is unmapped (doesn't work)<br />- - The two triggers are unmapped (shoulder buttons do)<br />- - The back button is unmapped<br />- \\"Mouse\\" mode isn't smooth, mouse movements are jerky, not very useful<br />- No drivers to make other modes work<br />- Buttons and sticks are kinda 'squishy' and don't feel crisp and responsive<br /><br />This would be a much better controller if they just enabled all the unmapped controls in HID mode. It would be even better if the buttons felt crisp.<br /><br />As it is, it does its job, but I'm a little disappointed. I wouldn't pay the MSRP $50 for it, but at $25 it's alright if you need portability most of all.
B00APUQRPC|4.0|Enjoyable feel good movie. If you're looking for the usual Clint Eastwood movie, this ain't it. The ending was fun.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|It is more dependable.  I have tried other micro cables.  My Kindle definitely charges more quickly  with this on in conjunction with the Kindle PowerFast.
B00BBFLBA6|5.0|It is a wonderful family movie to watch because it shows the never ending love of a father toward his child. He strives to do the best for his daughter and is such a cute movie.
B00C7APVU0|5.0|This will likely be the best rock album of 2013 and probably one of the most underrated.  This is such a polished band, great 70's sound to them, keeping classic rock alive.  Highly recommended.
193700788X|1.0|I was highly disappointed with this book. It was awful.  The book was boring and poorly written it almost seemed like an other author had written this book.  I was expecting more from the last book of the series.
B009NY43NY|4.0|Knowing that Charlaine was going to be ending the series with this book...I was curious as to how she was going to wrap up the characters.<br /><br />I won't be giving way any spoilers here....but lets just say, it ended the way that seemed natural.  I'm satisfied.  Of course i wanted another ending...but then the series couldn't really end that way.<br /><br />Kuddos to Charlaine Harris.<br /><br />BOOOO to you haters.  I can't believe that people have sent death threats.  Seriously people?  GET A LIFE!  It's her characters.<br /><br />If you don't like it.  WRITE YOUR OWN BOOK!
B00A8KJN14|5.0|This movie made me cry but it tells a beautiful story that made me laugh, cry, and happy. It was such a nice movie to see.
B007704HO6|5.0|I read this two months after I lost my cat due to kidney failure. I was hooked after the first sentence. Really wanted to know what happened to the soul mates. Really touched me how a man with almost nothing, made it a priority to care for a poor street cat. I literarily held my breath when Bob got sick, almost the same symtoms as my cat had when he was dying. Makes me want to go to London and meet them. Definitely going to read the follow up!
B00APJLFEG|5.0|Very cute and a little unique how it is told from the standpoint of the dad when it is about the teenage(can 118 be called teenage so long as she's a Dracula's daughter?) daughter falling in love with a--gasp!--human.
B00005YW4H|5.0|One of my favorite singers,and writers too.She is talented and beautiful.You can see why she is a hit.Thank You again.
B00A0MJA1I|5.0|I enjoyed watching Peter pan as a kid and I still do. I love nana in the story and It's a walk down memory lane.
B00BGIC2J2|2.0|Probably one of the worst movies of the year. Sophomoric humor, poor dialogue, mediocre acting, vulgar and simply not funny. 4 Rotten Tomatoes. If this is what 40somethings are like, even in satire, the country is doomed.
0671449028|5.0|I am planning to give this book as a baby shower gift. It is a wonderful book and hope the mommy-to- be loves it too...
B009A87X80|5.0|A Great talent,I will not forget as I age.I have my favorites,but her talent shines.Good stuff in an age of electronic noise music.
B00BESLHEA|1.0|These gifted actors should have invested there talents in a more well written story. Unless you like Quentin Terrible Tarantino's stuff I would advise avoiding spending anything on this movie.
193700788X|5.0|sad that it coming to an end but a good read and enjoyable book! Would encourage readers to decide for their self if it's a good or bad ending. All series come to an end. I will continue to read Ms. Harris' work when she sets out on her next book.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|O.k. I knew what to expect going into book. The book sucks you in only because the sex is not the average sex that most couples partake in. So yes, the reader wants to see just what this guy is going to suggest next and just how much she's willing to take.  With that said, it's some o f the worst writing I've ever read under any genre. On any given page the author Makes reference to Anastasia.s inner goddess multiple times, as well as the title fifty shades. I won't waste time reading  the others.
B004EBT5CU|5.0|Loved her voice,and as I age one learns to appreciate artists with her talent.A grammy award was deserved.Thank You again.
0891419063|5.0|Really enjoyed this book and reading of the accounts EB Sledge and what he and comrades went through in the Pacific. I haven't read many WWII books about the Pacific Theatre, but this definitely a VERY detailed account. Recommended for any history buff.
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|I had a problem with my original Kindle cable. The insulation dried out and was cracking and breaking off every time I handled the cable. I got a new one and it is nice and flexible and so far is working great.
B004SRPXWQ|4.0|comes with a short cartoon that grandkids liked and they love that it repeats what you say. the actions seem to confuse them, it acts like it can't hear you but still repeats what it hears.
B009ZQ8FQG|4.0|I do not watch much t.v., but this is one of my wife's favorite television shows. I did find the WWI historical context interesting.
B004UPAIDK|2.0|I have no one to &#34;blame&#34; for down loading this App, but let me save your money- don't buy it !
B007HACDLK|5.0|This is another great story by Vince Flynn. He uses places in the news and current events to make you think about what could be happening. Very entertaining.
B00023B1LC|5.0|I really like this series, I have watched all the DVDs (4 now) multiple times, and I rarely do that. This is a great movie. Too bad Matt won't make another on!
0446547638|5.0|This book was great!! I could not put it down!! As usual for Nicholas Spark, it was another awesome book. He is an awesome author!!
B00BI73CVI|3.0|This is the first time I saw Les Miz. I found that the singing dialogue made some of the words unintelligible, and did not like that type of delivery at all.<br /><br />I knew the story, and had heard reviews and other stories about previous versions. Also saw parts of the PBS program about the 25th anniversary of the show, but not enough to truly say that I had seen the movie. As such, I thought the movie was OK, but nothing to really crow about. Glad I saw it at home and paid a lot less money. I would have been disappointed had I seen it at the theater.
B001GCUNW6|5.0|We love the Ice Age movies and this one is just as much fun to watch as all the rest.
0525952926|3.0|I enjoyed the book but it could have been much  better. The idea of putting the characters  on the front lines for every historic event from 1922 until 1949 made the plot seem a bit contrived....not the history but the role of the characters.<br /><br />The sex was a bit too graphic. I had to cross off a number of people to whom I wanted to recommend it for this reason.<br /><br />There were times when it seemed like the characters should have reacted more when familiar names (like Peshkov) appeared.<br /><br />I thought the characters from Wales and England came across the best. The Americans were not particularly interesting.<br /><br />Good picture of life under Nazi rule in the 1930's and in Berlin after the Russians arrived in 1945.<br /><br />This was more interesting than The Fall of Giants but I think it was because of the<br />historical period rather than the characters themselves.
B000LXH0AE|4.0|My daughter recommended this movie to me and it is well worth watching.  Not your typical fare, but well done and insightful.  A more serious Will Ferrell than usual, but much human warmth and quiet humor.
B00C1BU7V8|3.0|The movie was more about the passing of the 13th amendment than anything else.<br /><br />I must say that when I watch a movie like this that is based on history, I view the movie with a very critical eye. I cannot imagine that the dialogue was as said, nor can I believe that the machinations involving the passing of this amendment was as portrayed (although I am sure that such political maneuvering occurred). I find such dramatizations as Rep. Stevens being in love with his black housemaid as an effort to play on our current thinking, and, for me, it just is a trick that diminishes the entire plot.<br /><br />Daniel Day-Lewis was superb as Lincoln; Sally Field only so-so as Mrs. Lincoln, although she was exceptionally good when she was yelling at him in their bedroom.  The other actors were plausible.<br /><br />Again, this review is based on my criticisms of the movie as an accurate depiction of the events that unfolded during the last few months of the Civil War. Although I know that this was a drama based on a book, and no one could hardly know what ever transpired during these months, and the conversations among the participants, I did not find that the film presented a believable course of action.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This calculator works great. Simple and easy to use. Love that it has large symbols for older folks. I recommend this app.
B0081336FO|5.0|There are no words to describe what i feel about this show. My friend told me i had to watch and i am so glad i took her advice. i love this show, i love how brilliant sherlock is. however, like all things in life, not everyone is going to react the same as me.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Hi i like apps to play with mommy is happy for mother's day just get seventeen cakes to eat minecraft is cooler than this
B005K17RU0|4.0|IMO more accurate than weather channel...I like that extreme weather warnings show up on my drop down menu and that there is easy access to other weather info across the country.
0062082353|1.0|It's interesting and goodness gracious hard hitting. I respect the authors bravery and skill but he writes so badly that he should be banned from ever doing so again. The book reads as though two raccoon hunters with one tooth and one brain cell between them are speaking in a pub. And when will people realise that immediately professing your love for your god(a) just marks you out as yet another ignorant believer who is convinced that anyone that doesn't believe what you believe is an oxygen thief? Constant proclamations of faith Faith are so low class / red neck republican / fundamentalist that the reader questions the sanity of everything else that are being asked to read
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|This game is great, especially for a free game based on a marvel comics character. The controls are easy and smooth and react great on the kindle fire HD. I like the idea of a daily mission objective it gives it an extra replability factor even though you literally have to wait a whole real 24 hours to play the daily.
1594202842|4.0|First, I want to say that I appreciate Chua's honesty throughout the book.  She never tries to sugarcoat her views on life, parenting, and the horrible things she says to her daughters, even in the passages that make her look outright abusive and like a huge b*tch (and there are plenty; in the beginning of the book, she says that she thinks that people who believe in astrology \\"have serious problems\\"). I also appreciate how Chua can be the bigger person and admit when she's wrong; she could have just listed her daughters' accomplishments and left it there, yet she revealed their power struggles, too. One thing that confused me about the book, however, was the tone.  Chua herself says that she wrote it in a sarcastic, joking tone, but, other than in the opening, I don't hear it.  I can't tell from the book if she still thinks that Chinese parenting is best, or if she has let up on her daughters, though I have heard that in real life, she has let her younger daughter, Lulu, be more social than before.  In all, I think Battle Hymn is a very funny and interesting book to read (from a Sociological prospective and not as a parenting guide), even if you don't agree with it (and I don't; thanks in part to this book, I know that I'll be a proud Western parent).
193700788X|4.0|I was afraid to read this book after hearing how mad people were at the spoilers. I must say, I was pleasantly surprised. I thought the book was great. Ms. Harris gave Sookie the happy ending she deserved.
B00006RAKP|5.0|Excellent selection of songs of old and newer songs.  A excellent collection that one who loves Elton you can not miss.  A must have..
B00BZODDYU|1.0|Very bad movie. Very slow at the beginning and the end is just plain ridiculous. The idea could be developed to make a much more interesting movie. Definitely NOT recommended.
B00CQ3SUAQ|5.0|Outstanding detective / psychological thriller. Lecter's character is perfectly in step with the other films in the Hannibal story. Apparently Lecter had only 16 minutes of screen time in Silence of the Lambs. This show explores his character much more thoroughly, so you get to see what the the antihero is all about.
B009NY43NY|1.0|I have read all of the Sookie Stackhouse books and enjoyed them even when I did not like where they were leading. This one feels forced and tries to tie up the loose ends too neatly. It's almost better to resolve it in one's own head rather than reading this. I would expand on my thoughts, but I do not want to give the story line away if someone feels they must read it.
B00BHU9BV6|1.0|Wow! This was not what I expected. Perhaps it got notably better after the first 12 minutes but we just couldn't take much more. I assume there were artistic reasons for the bazaar sets and over acting (ie play/theater acting vs big screen acting) but they were so distracting. Anyway, we shut it off without even a flinch that we had just paid $5 to rent it... We aren't really movie snobs, trust me we have sat through worst films, but something about the sets and the acting just made it impossible to stick it out.
