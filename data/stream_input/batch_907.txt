B00000JNOJ|5.0|Absolutely the best Muddy album I've heard. Dixon's stand-up bass sounds amazing, as does Buddy Guy's guitar.  Muddy really shows his smoothness & coolness on this album. This cd permanently resides in my player.
031606792X|5.0|My favorite book in the whole world is actually Breaking Dawn.This book had me spending all my time reading it.And I had actually finished the whole series I in 1 month.It was so romantic, and breathtaking.It was the book I wished my life was like.It just had so much fun,excitment,thriller,horror,shock,and pain.It was just my kinda book,the book I've been waiting for,and looking for, for half my life.The Breaking Dawn.
0061537969|4.0|Being an animal lover, I was instantly attracted to Enzo, the main character of The Art Of Racing In The Rain.  As he recanted his master's life story and his, I was quite awed by the fact that I, not a car lover, saw a new side to racing. It intrigued me. The one part of this book that bothered me was that neither Denny nor Enzo picked up on the fact that the twins were evil PRIOR to their final hideous deceit and and attack on Denny. I was reminded of how controlling some people can be and how awful it is to be on the witness stand in court.   This book offered a keen read on people and why and how they come to act in certain ways. I loved the ending because it offered a uplifting and happy thought as a dog's life comes to an end.
B00005QGAV|5.0|I have so many CD's and DVD's of Michael Jackson.  It's so obvious that I am and have been a fan, and this CD was great because of the amount of great songs.  I truly enjoyed it and will recommend this product to anyone.
0385339100|4.0|The Partner, while not as good as The Firm or The Pelican Brief, is another solid legal thriller from John Grisham.  Perhaps the term \\"thriller\\", shouldn't be used for this book, as most of the book is slower-paced and involves a man who has already been arrested for murder and theft. The book was written in 1997, and there is an outdated concept that stands out in this book to the newer reader, which is mainly that people should be shocked, simply shocked at the idea that the American government would ever torture a prisoner.  Sadly, this is no longer true, and the outrage over the torture of the protagonist makes the book seem a little naive and quaint to the newer reader.<br /><br />If you like other John Grisham novels, this one will not disappoint, but it's not in his top five, either.  Solid, not exceptional.
B000A2RRF4|5.0|Sadly, I never attended any of Michael Jackson's concerts, but this DVD certainly made up for it.  The footage of his dance moves and singing was amazing!  The fans certainly felt his magnetic personality with their fainting and screaming.  The part of the fans were comical, but the part about Michael Jackson singing was amazing.  He never lost his charm.
B000002LFZ|5.0|As advertised, this delivers all of Fleetwood Mac's greatest hits (the 1970s and 1980s version of Fleetwood Mac with Lindsay Buckingham and Stevie Nicks).  Very easy to listen to, very positive and upbeat music.  It's like having a really great radio station on for an hour. Because Fleetwood Mac has three lead singers, and three to four different songwriters, the songs do not all sound the same, which keeps the album from getting predictable.      If you own only one Fleetwood Mac album, this should be it.  If you are not familiar with their work, they are one of the best pop light-rock bands ever to exist.
B0000029LG|5.0|I am and always have been a HUGE fan of Michael Jackson.  So I'll just repeat what I've been saying...his CD's are definitely a sure buy!
0385341008|4.0|I enjoyed the story which is based completely on letters written to and from multiple characters. Flows well and was a fast read. I wish the delivery of the book was faster, it shouldn't take 4 weeks.
1573300403|5.0|Oh my goodness!  This video is definitely a great buy for any Michael Jackson fan!  There were parts of the video that showed displayed his talent as a true artist, not just as a singer, but also a dancer and his choreography.  I loved it!
044024367X|1.0|I love the Jack Reacher series. Well written and fun to read. Jack is just rough enough around the edges that you like him.  But this seemed to be a novel about another Jack Reacher. One that doesn't care about duty and honor: praises war deserters and then sleeps with a married woman. At the end, I was wondering what Reacher does stand for besides his version of vigilante justice (which in this novel was thin--beating up people because he was curious and they wouldn't give him answers).  The story plot was also lame. I'd have given it a pass if Jack Reacher stayed in character. But Lee Child laid an egg on this one.
B002AT4K9G|5.0|Fast and Furious takes all the hollywood garbage spunoff from the original film and completely demolishes it. This movie is even more badass than the first. The move is serious, and the acting 100000's better. Apparrantly everyone has been working on their acting skills over the past few years. The only thing I hated about this movie was that the one character I brought the film to watch doesn't last too long. O-well the movie is based around them. This movie has plenty of action, and it's not cheesy. There are no more \\"Granny shifting and double clutching\\" phrases in this movie. There is nomore \\"happy go lucky\\" street racer feel that 2Fast 2Furious gave off. This movie is series. Matter of fact this should have been the sequel to The Fast and The Furious. The one thing that suprised me about the film was how much the characters had developed. In the original movie they were all sort of \\"cartoony\\". That entire vibe is lost in this film. Like I said this is the Batman Begins of The F&F series. We go back to the roots of it all, and this time we do it right. There cars are there, but the story is focused and intense they are almost camaflauged into the plot. There is plenty of action, to watch, and not that \\"lets jump over the bridge\\" garbage from 2F&2F. This is probably the best F&F to date. I'm also guessing the last as well. It was a great way to end the series!
B0009XNUK0|5.0|This CD has been playing in my car for weeks now. Since MJ passed I have wanted to listen to the past and most recent of his music. This has it all. There is plenty of music for the money spent. I would recommend it to anyone wanting to listen to MJ's music from the Jackson 5 to the King of POP. Great CD!!
0470477237|5.0|From small to large, any business owner needs to read Socialnomics!  Until reading Qualman's book, I wasn't aware of the impact that social media sites could have.  I've finally started to set-up a facebook account, and to further leverage the LinkedIn account that I've neglected!
B000002KK2|5.0|I was 14 years old, when this album was issued. My 3 year older sister bought this album immediatly and no matter how young I was, I was mesmerized right away. You have to admit it, her singing is a little different.<br /><br />This album is simply outstanding. The songs are like folk songs, never too complicated or far fetched, but rather simple and straight from the heart. My 3 favorite songs are coolsville, the last chance to texaco and night train. I fact, 2 months ago I did take the night train to Goa in India and guess what song I was playing? Right. It never sounded more beautiful as it did 2 months ago, even after 30 years. Can bring tears to your eyes. Afterwards I gave this CD as a present to the Indian friends who invited us to Goa, just as a thank you.<br /><br />In 2004 a dream came through when I was Ricky Lee Jones at the North Sea Jazz Festial in The Hague. For days in advance I felt excited as a boys dream was coming tue. The concert had a little bit of a slow start, but it turned out to be great. The same approach, simply, no pretentions, straight from the heart with this particular enchanting singing. RLJ kept the audience in a grip, especially during the many moments she was singing solo or supported by only her own guitar playing. What a night! The ticket of that concert is lying next to my computer as I am writing this review.<br /><br />So, Mrs. Jones, in case you would read this, thank you for this beautiful album. Don't ask me how or why, but the music has become more and more important to me during the last 30 years and will continue to be so. For those who are considering buying this album, I hope my enthousiasm has helped you in making that decision. It is a true gem.

B001KVZ6G6|1.0|Where is the Blu-ray version with just the movie? I loved the movie but the fact that I have to pay for 4 discs is garbage. If/when there is a Blu-ray version of this with 1 disc (just the movie) I will give it 5 stars.    p.s. for those that are always saying you need to just review the movie, I am reviewing a PRODUCT: Up (4 Disc Combo Pack with Digital Copy and DVD) [Blu-ray]. Thanks.
1582701709|4.0|I took this book along on my trip to Sedona. Any spare time I had, I felt like reading more and more. It was eye opening to staying positive and the way we should be thinking to bring good things to us. It made sense and I learned a lot. I would recommend this book.
B0000DJE9R|5.0|Berry Gordy said it all at Michael Jackson's memorial...that Michael simply was the greatest entertainer of all time.  This CD displays his vocal range beautifully.  The only thing better is seeing Michael perform some of these hits on stage, making it a multi-dimensional experience.  Some of these hits were never performed publicly, and that is our loss.
B000002I8H|1.0|Tragically wasted opportunity, to match the magnificence of Sarah Vaughan's voice, with the wealth of material available, in the Beatles catalogue. Song selection could have been better, the arrangements could NOT have been worse. Paitch misfires on all cylinders. Most of the arrangements sound like really bad attempts, to sound like Earth, Wind and Fire. This could have been really special. Too bad it turned into this mess. Has to be Sarah's worst.
B0029NY9YO|3.0|Okay, I will admit, I never really read the Watchmen comic book. My roommate has it and while it has been in my hands I have only merely thumbed through it. So needless to say I wasn't entirely sure what to expect...I often think that no expectations are better than low or high. My other room was hard up for a movie night so we ran out and got this film. About twenty minutes into it I was so bored I wanted to cry. To do this review just I feel its only fair to break it down into two parts.<br /><br />WOW FACTOR:<br />Was awesome, the design and delivery of this film was brilliant. I love the stylized look and feel of the film and you really get into characters lives (albeit sometimes to much). I am a huge fan of any film that bring the pages of a comic book to life and not turn it into a Hollywood orgy. I am a big fan of Patrick Wilson so I enjoyed watching him once again play a quirky character (he's kinda like a male Mary-Louise Parker).<br /><br />Overall Story:<br />I think I fell asleep at least twice..okay not really. But my roomie was snoozing through part of it. She doesn't appreciate the gravity of design so she was bored the whole way through. My other roomie who is a fan of the comic book commented how much like the book the movie so maybe I just don't get this style of story telling.<br /><br />Will I immediately be selling my copy of the film?  No, while it was a snooze fest I think the art direction (and Wilson) of the film makes it at least a keeper for the collection to pull out on those inevitable two day Oklahoma blizzards where the world shuts down for 48 hours.<br /><br />Hope this helps.
B000W796OM|5.0|Great qualtiy,good condition,fast shipping. And of course it's Harry Potter so you know tht is entertaiment.
0439023483|5.0|I have to admit, since this book came off of the summer reading list, I didn't have high expectations but I was pleasantly surprised after reading this book. There was something about this story that kept me wanting more. I thought this book had the perfect amount of suspense. The only bad thing was that the plot was somewhat predictable. However, it's definitely one of the few books to capture my attention since reading the Twilight saga. Most every book I've read after Twilight has been less than exciting but this book holds it's own. I found myself reading more than I normally do, especially since it's the summer. Once \\"The Games\\" started, I couldn't put it down. I can't wait until the second book, Catching Fire, comes out!

B0000027RL|4.0|Rightfully one of the 90's loudest rock attacks. For a brief moment, as Pearl Jam entered the scene with this blistering debut, they helped to usher arena rock into more thoughtful areas without loosing any of the aggression they proceeded to shed over the next twenty years.
1592401791|5.0|As a Beatle fan for over 40 years I have read about them extensively. I have seen \\"Engineered by Geoff Emerick\\" on many Beatles albums and also heard him mentioned in other Beatles books.  When a \\"Beatles Insider\\" writes a book, that is the one I will buy.  This book was an absolute treasure.  Mr. Emerick was present at the very first Beatles recording at EMI/Abbey Road Studios, and also engineered their very last album \\"Abbey Road\\". His story is an incredible one, and he tells it so humbly. Imagine being just 19 and your first engineering job is The Beatles' \\"Revolver\\" album!  The first challenge at that session is John Lennon asking him to make his voice sound like \\"The Dalai Lama chanting on top of a mountain\\" on the song \\"Tomorrow Never Knows.\\"  Mr. Emerick tells you about the Beatles' personalities, their musicial abilities and all the inside information on the Beatles recordings.  All the engineering tricks and Producer George Martin's techniques are laid bare, like George Martin playing an out of tune piano in sync with George Harrison's guitar solo because Harrison can't nail the solo; the piano synching the exact notes with the guitar blended the sound beautifully, masking the untidy guitar playing (this happened on the guitar solo in the song \\"A Hard Day's Night\\"). He was an integral part of creating the Beatles' masterpiece \\"Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band,\\" which was the album where The Beatles were unified in the goal of recording the best album of their lives.  It was a downhill journey from then on in the Beatles' relationships.  Geoff also recalls the first day Yoko appeared on the scene in the recording studio, and the resulting strain of her presence. Things got so stressful during the recording of \\"The White Album\\" that he actually resigned from the sessions.  The Beatles asked Geoff to leave EMI Studios to be Chief Engineer of Apple Studios, which they entrusted him to design and have built. Geoff travelled to Lagos, Nigeria with Paul & Linda McCartney and Denny Laine (Wings) to engineer the album \\"Band on the Run.\\"  He was engineering a recording session for Paul at George Martin's AIR Studios in London the morning after John Lennon died.  He also prepared the Beatles Anthology material for release on CD as well as engineered the new recordings \\"Free as a Bird\\" and \\"Real Love\\", using demo tapes of John Lennon provided by Yoko for the surviving Beatles to complete. He was there for it all- and I now know why he entitled the book \\"Here, There and Everywhere.\\"da McCartney and Denny Laine (Wings) to engineer the album \\"Band on the Run.\\"  He was engineering a recording session for Paul at George Martin's AIR Studios in London the morning after John Lennon died.

B000002MJC|3.0|3 1/2    Some phenomenal synth-pop in their production stride here, taking liberties with various genres to create hauntingly pretty, lasting impressions that contrast dance and melodic sides nicely, though throughout the album generic dark-wave tendencies creep into too much of the process, making SOFAD simply good with sides of brilliance, rather than reversed.
6305327084|5.0|I enjoyed this movie very much, fast paced humor, lots going on between all of the characters.
0439023491|5.0|Catching Fire was a very exciting read. There were elements in the book that took me by surprise and made the book even more intense than the first one. By the time I was half way through the book I could not put it down. Plan to read this book on a weekend or when you don't have anything else to do because there is a point where you have to finish it. I am anxiously awaiting the third book! Happy reading.
031606792X|3.0|After reading some of the scathing reviews about this book versus the first three in the series, I almost didn't bother to read this one. However, I'm not someone that can leave things \\"undone\\" and I figured it might give me closure to the series and I won't have to think about it. I decided to go for it and I'm so glad I did.    I won't pretend that this is a Literary great. To me, this entire series was fun and fluff - teen style - and that is what I expected. This final book did not disappoint me as it did some others. It was a bit long and repetitive in some parts. It could have been about a hundred pages shorter than it was and still accomplished the same thing but I endured.    I agree that the \\"fetus\\" was a bit freaky, but over all it was tolerable. I do feel like Edward should have bitten Bella for her transformation - I was actually looking forward to that as a climatic scene - so that was disappointing. (It wouldn't have hurt since this was a Happily Ever After story anyway.)    I do not agree with some reviews that Edward took a back seat to Renesmee. And I disagree that the \\"imprinting\\" between Jacob and the child was pedophilia, although I thought the whole imprinting thing was odd from the moment it was introduced.    This is not a series that I want to re-read so I am glad I have my closure. And since I look at this a fun and fluff, the Happily Ever After ending fit in just fine.    In summary, if you just want to walk away feeling like you went the entire journey with Bella and Edward then by all means read the final installment. If you are looking for an earth shaking cliff hanger \\"event\\" then maybe you should stop after book three and let your imagination do the rest. I just don't have the extra energy to hang on to this story and improvise - so the last book did the trick.
B0025X4OYI|5.0|Classic Ray...a short scene in the movie, and a lot of great tunes, many that have been covered so many times you would not see them as \\"country\\" today.
0316044695|5.0|[[ASIN:0316044695 Lone Survivor: The Eyewitness Account of Operation Redwing and the Lost Heroes of SEAL Team 10]]    Where do guys like these come from!!!???  At times I just had to put the book down because it was so intense when thinking about the incredible punishment and pain that they were absorbing on that mountain while still giving accurate and deadly fire to the Taliban.  SEAL's and all Special Ops type people are ready and trained to give way more than 100% for this country and, more importantly, to their comrades.  This book is the most eye-opening, intense riveting book I have ever read about combat and the supreme sacrifice.  After all of that punishment and death, Marcus still had to survive under incredible circumstances.  An absolute \\"must read\\" for anyone that wants to know how the ultimate warrior operates and why they do what they do.  Thank God for them and that they are on our side!
B00005RYKU|2.0|I wanted to like this movie, I really did. I was looking for some good movies to watch and I saw this one. Eh.. not what I expected.<br /><br />From the front, it looks like it'll be a super scary, awesome movie.<br /><br />Undoubtedly it was good at parts, and the acting was pretty good, but... it was one of those kind of movies where you are watching the movie and you start yelling at the screen, \\"No! No, don't do that! Jeez, you- no! I can't believe she did that... Idiot.\\" Like, if you know the killer's in the dark room and they go into the dark room anyways because they lost their cat or something...?<br /><br />I actually found myself calling the main character an idiot more than once. When the kids (not to give away the plot) get out of the basement, they go and get the keys to the car to get away. Personally, I would have hightailed it out of there and ran as fast as possible away. Secondly, when Ruby sees (spoilers) Erin dead, wouldn't you think she'd call 911? But nope, she doesn't. Thirdly, the girl is 16 years old; she is taking a Drivers Ed class. You'd think she'd at least know a LITTLE bit about driving... in the scene where she's taking her brother away with her and it's raining, she drives like a little kid! Sure she was only in the class for a little while, and she did say she was a bad driver, but seriously?<br /><br />All in all, if you and your friends wanna pop something in to watch and you feel like making fun of the character's stupid mistakes, go right on ahead and watch! We all need those movies from time to time, you know? I'm not being sarcastic when I say that, by the way.<br /><br />I did give it two stars, though, because it did make me jump and gasp a few times. I always love movies that can genuinely make me gasp or jump. :) It's not a bad movie, it just could have been directed better.
B0000CDJPQ|5.0|There is not much to say.  Plugged it into my computer.  Plugged my FireWire 400 cable into it.  WORKED!
B000FQJAIW|5.0|Note- for this and the subsequent films, I will be reviewing the theatrical releases, not the re-released special editions.<br /><br />Science fiction was hugely popular in the 50s with the Jet Age and the Space Race. There were even the Flash Gordon serials earlier than that. But once the sixties hit, especially the late sixties, movie makers went with more realistic stories. I know 2001: A Space Odyssey and Star Trek were made in that time frame, but they were still along telling a more realistic (for that genre anyway) story. Then this came along! With cutting edge special effects (for the time) and an interesting story made this one of the highest grossing films in  history. And also influenced the people behind the Bond films (FYEO was supposed to be after TSWLM but due to the popularity of this, was pushed back and MR was filmed instead.) and the people behind Star Trek (though two totally different things, this did influence them to change the Phase Two TV project into the first film).<br /><br />That's enough backstory. The acting is better than what we'd get in episodes 2 and 3 (especially from Hayden Christensen). Mark Hamill, better known today as the voice of the Joker on the various DCAU projects, plays Luke Skywalker with innocence and sincerity as we see the young hero thrust from his average lifestyle into the battle to save the galaxy. Harrison Ford plays Han Solo with a cockiness yet is the rogue with a heart of gold (I think he was just warming up for Indiana Jones). Carrie Fisher as Princess Leia, I think though I maybe wrong, is the first female movie character during the women's libs of the seventies to be able to take charge of a situation (like during the rescue in the prison cell) and hold her own in a gun fight. Darth Vader (suit actor David Prowse and voiced by James Earl Jones) is one of the more intimidating villains in cinema history and just as formidable in a lightsaber duel and a dog fight in space. Along with Tarkin, played by an impressive Peter Cushing, is almost as cold as Vader himself (since Tarkin is pretty much ordering Vader around in this), especially when he threatens Leia to blow up Alderaan. And lastly, Alec Guinness plays Obi-Wan Kenobi as a gentle, caring teacher to Luke though an old man, can still be pretty formidable in a fight. And the only human character who actually retains any dignity with his portrayal in the recent films. Again the incomprable John Williams is at the conductor's position, with another rousing score of action and suspense, though this is when his movie scores started to share some similar cues (most, if not all his scores are done by the London Symphony Orchestra).<br /><br />Now I will say that I saw the Special Editions before I saw the original prints and I did enjoy them. But after seeing the original release (though it should've recieved the same treatment that the other editions got), I will say that it is the superior version. Lucas needs to stop \\"improving\\" his movies and leave them the way they are (like his Young Indiana Jones series, I heard they filmed new stuff and removed whole episodes from continuity). He totally dishonors all the work that went into these original productions and only does it so he can re-release it on whatever video format and make a profit. I don't think he cares so much for the most popular film in his vault.ushing, is almost as cold as Vader himself (since Tarkin is pretty much ordering Vader around in this), especially when he threatens Leia to blow up Alderaan.

B000W7JWUA|5.0|This is a fantastic game which has simple enough rules not to spend forever trying to learn and varied enough for some very challenging and fun games. I especially like it with the cities and knights expansion which adds a whole new layer. The game board does shift easily which makes it difficult to play with cats around.
B00003CXA6|4.0|Overall a good civil war movie, wish they would make many more.  My only issue were some technical/historical discrepancies...the Maine regiment acted differently toward a black man that they found from what they would have done in real life, too politically correct.  The friend/advisor to Col. Chamberlain had on an officer's pattern coat, but no sign of rank.
1558908323|2.0|This is where Hollywood movies started to go wrong.  Mimic stinks.    Dramatic music for every action scene intended to make the film seem more important than it really is, a bad storyline that tries to succeed by covering it up with special effects, and poor acting all around.      The only part I liked was the predictable segment where the one woman was examining a baby roach (that was actually huge) and it jumped up and pinched her hand.  Other scenes throughout the film just felt really exaggerated.    It's not  a scary movie, it's not gripping, and it's not particularly good either.  It features a slow build-up type of suspense that misses the mark more than anything else.  Perhaps a less exaggerated storyline could have saved it, but I have a feeling it *still* would have been boring because of the slow pacing in the beginning and the overly dramatic soundtrack.  A perfect case of Hollywood special effect abuse.
0307454541|5.0|This is book I didn't want to stop reading and didn't want it to end. As a reader I could see into the characters but there was still a mystery about them, just like meeting new people. You see what they look like, you have heard them speak, have formed an idea of what they are like, and you know just enough about them to want to know more. So you have to keep reading. Fantastic.<br />I bought the next book in the series immediately. And have recommended this book to everyone I know who reads!
1423101472|5.0|This book is a must read just like the rest of the series. You will love it. I read the first and second one thinking hmmm.... this might be good turns out it was amazing and so is this one. I just had to read the rest of the series. For everyone who is putting it down saying it is harry potter like, don't believe them i doesn't interupt the story one bit. You will like it 100%. This is my favorite series.

B001NXDSLQ|3.0|One thing  I like about this film was the realism, I get so sick of hearing about \\"wooodstock\\" that it was 3 days of Peace and Love....BS!  The hippies crashed the fences and didnt give a crap about the promoters and other men and and women who put the festival on. Feeling they can just storm in and not have to pay for an event and just stiff the promoters to have to dig in their own pockets to pay the artists and everything else,  With Woodstock tho, the promoters already had a film and record deal signed and wasnt too concernd about tickets but they still took a huge financial hit.<br /><br />Great documentary about the so called \\"love child\\" generation that were just as selfish and spoiled as the ME generation, same crap, different title.<br />Wish the film were still a bit longer but it is what it is.<br /><br />Great performances by Jimi Hendrix, Janis and many others.
B000002J0B|4.0|Although, like Bob Dylan's album \\"Blood on the tracks\\", this album is mostly mellow in sound, it does have some rock moments. Not being a true Led Zeppelin convert, I can't really call any album other than \\"IV\\" a \\"masterpiece\\" but albums like \\"III\\" and this one are their next best. Although I like the roots rock of \\"III\\" the best, behind \\"IV\\", I do think that an album like \\"Houses of the holy\\" has the potential to grow on you more, which is something I can't say about their other albums that I've listened to, even though Believers consider them some of the greatest albums of all time.    Anyway, the best song on this album is:    D'yer mak'er - really like the drumming in this song. It has a reggae infused pop/rock flavour to it. The lyrics are catchy as is the squealy vocal style. Interesting drumming too.    Next best songs:     The rain song - running at 7:39 minutes in length, this is a sort of pretty song featuring accoustic guitar. The electric guitar emits Hawaaian sounds. A mellow track which puts into mind songs like E.L.O's \\"Strange magic\\" and maybe even a melody which Shirley Bassey may have sung.    The ocean - a boogie rock song, with riffing that is definitely in AC/DC's territory. Ordinarily I wouldn't have thought that Led Zeppelin could have been an influence on AC/DC, but maybe, with this song, the argument could be made. The track has static at times, e.g. at around 1:45 into this song. The outro to this song is 1950's style do-wop, I think.    Songs that grew on me on second listen:    Over the hills - starts with an accoustic guitar, in a mellow manner, then gets a little more rock, with a country flavour to it. Has a hymnal outro and is otherwise sometimes pretty, with some rock'n'roll type vocals at times.    No quarter - another track which is at least 7 minutes in length. A very mellow, dreamy track but does verge towards rock music at times. Puts in mind Black Sabbath (think \\"Planet Caravan\\") or Pink Floyd type tracks. Good riff in this song and the keyboard has a watery sense to it.    The rest:    The song remains the same - the intro puts in mind bands like The Who...you could mistake the intro for a Who song in any case...perhaps Led Zeppelin were influenced by that band, for this song at least. A bassy track, with lead guitar, and I initially thought that a woman was singing this song(listen to the end of the song. Some falsetto is utilised, vocally)!    The crunge - a funky song with a disco flavour to the bass guitar and lead guitar.    Dancing days - a sort of interesting track...with sort of catchy guitar playing and vocal melodies.    Personally, I think that this album is better than their first two albums, but not as good as \\"IV\\" and \\"III\\". However, it is the kind of album that may improve with age and repeated listens (haven't explored Led Zeppelin's studio albums until this year, so the 'age' of this album for me is just less than one year!). Also, I like this album better than \\"Physical Graffiti\\", which, for some reason, gets nominated as an all time great album. Also prefer this album to \\"Presence\\" as well.
B000SEIK2S|5.0|I read this series out of sequence, I read The Ghost Brigades first. I liked that novel a lot (see my review) but I like this one better. John Scalzi has a lot of imagination, that is all I can say. No need to go into a lot of detail here, the point is he has a really interesting concept which is novel and worth exploring. There is a lot of sci-fi out there which is a rehash of some idea from the past. No so much here.     So I am reading The Last Colony now and hope it is as good...if you like scientific sci-fi with interesting characters you'll care about, go for it.

0792163710|5.0|Not only one of the greatest Westerns of all time, but the production was well ahead of its time.  It's captured beautifully on this disc--the color, choreography, detail, combined with outstanding acting and an excellent Western story.  You'll be glad you purchased your own copy.
B000002KE2|4.0|It's not unusual for any of this band's first three albums to get accorded the honour of \\"best Black Sabbath album\\". Their third album, \\"Master of reality\\", pretty much is the prototypical Sabbath album from then on. Even albums after that, up to \\"Sabotage\\", have their fans, who view that album as the band's best. From my point of view, \\"Vol.4\\" is down a notch in quality from \\"Master of reality\\", but up to, and including \\"Sabotage\\", the band have a remarkable consistency of output, quality wise.       Best song:    Changes - a slow tempo song with heartfelt lyrics. Ony the piano and the synthesiser are utilised. Melodic, with Ozzy providing good presence on vocals.       Next best:    FX - an experimental instrumental track, perhaps featuring a guitar or something like that. Maybe it is also a synthesiser. Here the synthesiser sounds like it is providing incidenctal music for a sci-fi or horror movie.    Cornucopia - the guitar sound makes this track sound like Swamp Rock.     Supernaut - grinding guitar and has a Lenny Kravitz vibe to it (think \\"Are you gonna go my way\\". For that matter, sometimes this song brings to mind the riffs in Pseudo Echo's version of \\"Funky Town\\").    Under the sun - the intro brings to mind their debut album's vibe of Gothic Rock. Can be read as a statement of the band's Philosophy, although, contrasting this song with their previous \\"After forever\\", it has to be remarked that a Black Sabbath 'philosophy' seems more of a mask which they wear and discard for something else later...like The Sex Pistols with their superficial embrace of anarchy and, remarkably, fascism (as if those two philosophies aren't like oil and water)! Drummer Bill Ward provides some big drum fills in this song. Outro is good too...it's like a rock band's version of Tubular Bells.       The rest:    Wheels of confusion - an epic 8:14 in length. Intro features a wailing blues sound and then steps into a Steppenwolf type riff (think \\"Born to be wild\\") on both guitar and bass. Guitar has a buzzing sound to it and the vocals lack presence. A prog-rock kind of song.    Tomorrow's dream - has a boogie rock vibe to it with tinny percussion (sort of like a cow bell). Guitars sound synthy and the vocals lack presence, again.    Snowblind - a riff song with a nice vocal shift in it, where it becomes more melodic. Lead guitar is bluesy and I think the song features the violins at the end. Has a synthesiser too.    Laguna sunrise - the second instrumental on this album. Has two accoustic guitars and what sounds like a symphony, perhaps...violins do feature in this song. A gentle, melodic track.    St.Vitus dance - has a BIG sounding riff (heavy and grating). Instruments have a greater presence in this song than other songs on this album. Think that my notes on this song subbest that the percussion on this song is like that in 60's pop...a \\"She loves you\\" type vibe, or something of the sort.    Recommendations:    Master of reality  Black Sabbath albums after \\"Vol.4\\".    Blue Cheer's debut album. In my view, this band were the first to have a heavy metal album. Very influenced by Jimi Hendrix's sound.    If, like me, you enjoy Black Sabbath's experimental tracks, you might want to try out Vanilla Fudge's debut album, which came out before Black Sabbath was created, and was also heavy sounding, for its time.
B000HT3P7E|5.0|This is a very original series! Very fun and funny! This will make you laugh and cry at times. Alyson Hannigan and Jason Segel play the dream relationship, funny and in love. Neil Patrick Harris is an incredibly shallow, womanizer.
B001NFNFNU|5.0|This movie about the abduction of a child and police corruption in 1920s Los Angeles was disturbing to watch.  It's hard to believe that this type of thing actually happened not all that many years ago.  Angelina Jolie plays a mother, Christine Collins, whose nine-year-old son, Walter, disappeared in March of 1928, seemingly into thin air.  The frustration and the run around she gets from a corrupt L.A. police department makes you wonder how something like that could have happened.  And the psychiatrist and people working at the mental hospital later on in the movie are almost worse.  It's almost hard to remember a time when women were treated so poorly by men in power.  The acting was superb.  There wasn't a wink link in the whole cast.  By the end of the movie there are so many people involved in the cover-up that you wonder if anyone in charge is actually honest.  Unfortunately, things like this probably happen more often than we are aware.<br /><br />The other thing I really liked about the movie was all the sets and wardrobe.  The little details made this movie that much more interesting and believable.  Clint Eastwood did a wonderful job of directing and truly captured the feeling of the period.  Although the movie was about 2 hours and 20 minutes it felt like about an hour.  I was so engrossed in the story and the way it moved, there wasn't a wasted word or scene.  It's disturbing, but not one that you want to miss.
0142000671|4.0|This is an authentic, somber tragedy, set in early 20th century California.  We follow a dreamer, and his companion who is a child in a giant's body.  They travel from place to place on foot to find work then to finally end up on a farm where dreams and life come to an end.    Stienbeck depicts these pathetic, hard, and lost lives with an eye for detail.  This is a simple story with a simple dialect.  A good read.    LORD Bless  Scott
B00005614M|4.0|This is a great classic album. My only complaint is that it would be so much better in stereo (it's a mono recording).

I Had A Dream  12. Do You Take Dexter Morgan?    Video  All 12 episodes of Dexter come to Blu-ray with 1080p AVC/MPEG-4 video presentations, and look just as great as Season 1 and Season 2 did. Unlike many recent television releases, Dexter truly shines in high-definition. The show's sunny and colorful environment brings some of the most vibrant colors and fantastic detail on a television release. Black levels held up quite well, aside from a few darker-lit scenes. Like previous seasons, there is a healthy amount of grain present at times, but is not really intrusive to the experience. Fans of the show must pick up the Blu-ray release. 9/10.    Audio  A 5.1 Dolby TrueHD audio track is included, sounding very very nice. The show's music is once again a beautiful thing to experience at the beginning of every episode, with such a dynamic and aggressive music mix, each instrument and sound clear as can be. Dialogue was always clear and easy to understand, and the mix did a great job at creating environment for the show. The track doesn't always call for a lively mix, but when it fits, it's used well. 8/10.    Extras    BD-Live  The features currently do not work for me, but the following are definitely included:  Dexter By Design - Book Excerpts  First two episodes of United States Of Tara, Season 1  First two episodes of The Tudors, Season 3  Interviews with Michael C. Hall, Julie Benz, Jennifer Carpenter, Lauren Velez & David Zayas    Blu-news Summary  Dexter is definitely one of my big television loves, the show is dark and humorous, and will have you wanting to watch episode after episode until you realize what time it is. The show is completely unique, and anyone who gives the show a chance will love it.    Dexter: The Third Season brings some great new characters to the show, some lasting longer than others. This Season also features quite a bit of changes in the office for all the characters we have all come to love, from Batista to Deb. But those changes are nothing compared to what Dexter has to face this season, including some good and bad surprises. The season is a bit less exciting than the second season was, but definitely better than the first season.    The Blu-ray release is fantastic, featuring top notch video and a good audio mix. Extras are a tad disappointing as they are exclusive to BD-Live, but I believe the DVD doesn't include anything at all without a computer. Despite a few annoyances, this season is still fantastic compared to most shows on TV, and deserves to be 'Highly Recommended.'
0802136834|5.0|Alison Weir's attention to detail makes this book come alive - I marveled at the fact that this breathtaking royal drama actually happened. Each wife of Henry VIII was a fascinating character and through his choice of each one, the reader coems to know the King in each stage of his life, from boyhood, to adventurous manhood, midlife crisis and finally old age.
055357342X|5.0|The war for control of the Seven Kingdoms rages on, but now mainly consists of the Lannisters in the south against the Starks in the north. Meanwhile in the far North, a huge barbarian army marches on the Wall with the intent of taking back much of the land to the south of it. In the continent to the east, Danerys Targaryen uses her dragons to gather an army for her own assault on Westeros.<br /><br />So far, this series has just gotten more interesting with each volume, and this is my favorite of the three so far. All of the characters face difficult situations and have to make tough choices. In enjoyed seeing some new environments such as the strange cities in the east that Danerys encounters, and the view of the people north of the wall. The book does exactly what it needs to do; it continues and deepens the ongoing plot lines of the series and made me anxious to read the next book.
B000TM1CKQ|5.0|This season gets sad! It has a nice and still funny outcome! Neil Patrick Harris begins to show a little heart in this season! Enjoy this great show!
B00014TJ7K|4.0|1987 saw quite a few comebacks happen in rock and roll. The Grateful Dead released \\"In The Dark\\", Ace Frehley released \\"Frehley's Comet\\", and Elton John returned to MCA records and scored a top 10 hit with the live version of \\"Candle In The Wind\\". However, all these comebacks being good can not hold a candle to \\"Cloud Nine\\". I would say this is George's finest hour since \\"All Things Must Pass\\". It's a lot more lush sounding, but it can still rock. I remember the night I first heard \\"I Got My Mind Set On You\\". I was returning from some mall in Springfield where I just purchased Dokken's \\"Tooth and Nail\\". Anyway back to \\"Got My Mind\\" I found it to be a rather fun song, and decided after a month of hearing it let's just buy the album. Well as I said it's lush sounding, but can still rock The title track, \\"When We Was Fab\\", \\"Devil's Radio\\" are pure classics. There was also a good ballad, or love song whatever you want to call it called \\"Someplace Else\\", and probably the weakest point of the album was \\"Take My Breath Away From Heaven\\". However, still kudos to Jeff Lynne for crafting one of the few really good albums of the 1980's, and kudos to Eric Clapton for helping out on guitar. This would help George back into the limelight as he would team up with Lynne, Roy Orbison, Bob Dylan, and Tom Petty to become known as the Travelling Wilburys.
B002BIULQC|4.0|Tech Specs  Video: 1080p AVC/MPEG-4  Audio: 7.1 DTS-HD Master Audio  Disc Size: 39.0 GB  Film Size: 22.1 GB  Film Rating: G  Region: A    Video  Hannah Montana: The Movie comes to Blu-ray with a 1080p AVC/MPEG-4 video presentation. I have to say I was expecting an oversaturated bubble gum pink and colorful presentation, but instead we get a more natural looking film with rich but subtle colors. The film's look varied by scene, sometimes being sharp and detailed, and other times a bit more soft and flat.    There was a thin layer of grain present throughout the majority of the film, and black levels generally held up good. The soft look of the film surprised me a bit though, sometimes making scenes look a bit more dull and flat. It wasn't too bad though, and the transfer certainly has more positives than negatives. Fans of the film should be pleased with this Blu-ray effort. 8/10.      Audio  A 7.1 DTS-HD Master Audio track is included and I have mixed reactions. If you forget this is a 7.1 track, it's actually pretty good. the additional two speakers have minimal use throughout, they are active during any song in the film but very quiet in the mix. The audio is a bit more quiet than your average mix to begin with, so it helps to turn up the volume a bit more than usual on your receiver when viewing the film.    Dialogue was clear as can be, front and center. There are certain songs dialogue that aren't as impressive, due to the mixing of the song, and the obvious major editing of the vocals. There are also songs that sound very good and bring the oomph I was hoping for, such as 'Hoedown Throwdown', 'The Climb' and 'You'll Always Find Your Way Back Home.' 'The Climb' was one of my favorite audio moments in the film, with each instrument playing getting a bigger feel of separation and quality, the vocals also felt much more natural and really showed off the high-def audio track.    The film's effects are generally very front heavy, although they do expand more into the surround area at times. The track was far from disappointing though, and fans of the film will be very pleased with the upgrade in clarity and overall quality. 8.5/10.      Extras    Disc 1:    Audio Commentary  with Director Peter Chelsom    Deleted Scenes (10:36) (HD)  Four deleted scenes are included, with each deleted scene explained.

Choreographer Jamal Sims and some of the cast show how to do the Hoedown Throwdown.    Find Your Way Back Home (15:07) (HD)  Miley Cyrus, Billy Ray Cyrus, and Emily Osment all show you some of their favorite places from their hometowns.    I Should Have Gone To Film School - With Jason Earles (15:19) (HD)  Jason Earles goes behind-the-scenes of making the film. It features a good amount of behind-the-scenes footage, although the making of is explained for kids to easily understand.    Fun With Hannah And The Gang (3:53) (HD)  Bloopers from the film.    BD-Live:  Radio Disney  Currently unavailable.    Country Store  Available during the film or directly. During the film this feature will allow you to select Hannah Montana items throughout the film and purchase them later.    Disc 2:  DVD copy of the film    Disc 3:  Digital Copy of the film    Blu-news Summary  Hannah Montana: The Movie is a very average but fun family film, the more family content on Blu-ray the better and this one definitely shines when compared to many available. The film is very cheesy and bubbly, but there's nothing wrong with that, especially for younger audiences. it's a film that will have your younger kids laughing, your tweens possibly crying of joy, and you surprised it wasn't as bad as you thought it would be.    The Blu-ray release is good, not amazing, but I'm glad the Blu-ray is given the deluxe treatment when it comes to this release, also including both a DVD and Digital Copy for your kids to take on the road or watch in their bedrooms. The video presentation was pleasing, the audio was nice, and the bonus features were aimed at kids but still enjoyable overall. This disc is 'Highly Recommended' for fans, 'Recommended' for those with tweens and children, and 'A Solid Rental' for those who haven't seen it but are curious.
B0000AM6IY|1.0|The movie West Side Story won 10 Awards. You would think that a update DVD would have been made,but no. The colors are washed out which ruins quite a bit of the movie. You would think someone would have remaster to protect this classic movie.
B000ZEE3I6|1.0|I finally realized what was causing me disappointment with the HP movies.  The continuity of the books was missing in the movies.  It's almost as if those in charge of making decisions hadn't read the books.  There were just too many missing parts to make a transition to the Deathly Hallows.  The Burrow is destroyed (didn't make sense in the movie and wasn't in the book)so where will the wedding take place?  What wedding?  Bill and Fleur weren't in the movie or even mentioned.  Given the track record of past movies, I'm not particularly optimistic about the last movie.
B0000041LO|5.0|These 9 CDs of all of Haydn's piano trios is extremely enjoyable to listen to, lively and beautifully thoughtful by turns, inventive, playful, and performed with insight and expert skill and empathy by the Beaux Arts Trio.    I am usually wary of chamber music with violins, which often seem to be recorded sounding too harsh and grating to my ears, but like the Mozart piano and violin sonatas performed by Arthur Grumiaux (violin) and Walter Klien (piano), the violin and cello sound warm and expressive, or cool and thoughtful, but not sharp and uncomfortably biting.    These are great performances of great music, equally good for background music or for devoted or meditative listening.

0765350386|4.0|'Mistborn' is the first book in The Final Empire' trilogy by Brandon Sanderson.<br /><br />Some possible ***Spoilers*** to follow<br /><br />This is the story of a young woman called Vin, a 'Mistborn' who has an unrealized talent for 'burning' metals (Allomancy) as a source of magic; talents that are about to be refined by another, more experience Mistborn, named Kelsier.<br /><br />The book has many fantasy attributes; a new (at least to me) magic source, clandestine plotting, unexpected twists and turns, a little romance and of course, the classic struggle between good and evil.<br /><br />The Pros:<br /><br />1.)Sanderson's main talents are weaving an intriguing story, developing interesting characters and providing us, the readers, with some extraordinary and tense battles.<br /><br />2.)There are a couple of maps; one is an overview of the general area and the other is a more detailed drawing of the city of Luthadel (where most of the story takes place).<br /><br />The Cons:<br /><br />1.)The writing, while well done in describing events and battles, tended to bog down in its attempts to relate conversations between groups and individuals; conversations that seemed a little scripted or forced.<br /><br />2.)However, my main concern for this work was the 'believability' factor...let me explain. A great deal of time in this book seemed to be spent on sessions of grandiose scheming to defeat the evil 'ruler', (and I've no problem with that). My concern arises from the fact that the details of this 'scheming' (which involves the recruiting of thousands of men, from many different locales, over a period of several months), gives nary a thought or worry to the fact that just a single leak of information to the enemy would render the entire plans worthless. Nor, did such a 'leak' ever occur; this to me, just didn't seem realistic.<br /><br />Conclusion:<br /><br />A fantasy with a new and interesting, well thought-out source of magic. And while the quality of writing, with the exception of some character dialogues, was generally good, there were some issues involving lack of believability; issues that prevent this very good fantasy story form being great. Nonetheless, this is a solid first book in the trilogy, with enough quality to make me want to get the subsequent books. 3 1/2 to 4 Stars.<br /><br />Ray Nicholsonsues involving lack of believability; issues that prevent this very good fantasy story form being great. Nonetheless, this is a solid first book in the trilogy, with enough quality to make me want to get the subsequent books. 3 1/2 to 4 Stars.    Ray Nicholson
1416550542|2.0|I found the book cumbersome and difficult to follow.  Really good prose doesn't confuse readers, it draws them into the story and keeps one's attention focused.  There's not enough depth to the characters and the writing too disjointed for this reader. Time is too precious to have to try and figure out where and who the characters are in time.  Read \\"Time and Again\\" if you want to see how to take readers back and forth through time.  Really polished prose is a joy to read.  Unfortunately, I didn't find it here.

B0009S2T0M|5.0|Straight to the point:    I loved this movie. I recommend it to everyone. It has an English language track for the film and English subtitles for all the special features including director commentary.    People should not expect elaborate improbable martial arts scenes, choreographed gun fights, excessive gore, explosions, car chases, and an expected ending.    Do expect plot twists, character development, great visuals, brutality, violence, moral dilemmas, great acting, and psychological drama.    This is a violent revenge movie, but doesn't follow the main stream revenge movie plot.  The message of the movie is that revenge never satisfies anyone. This seems to be the message of all the few Asian revenge themed movies I've seen. So, don't watch it if you are not a fan of these type of Asian movies.    What made me want to see Oldboy:    I first bought [[ASIN:B000BGH2A4 Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance]]. I then discovered that [[ASIN:B000BGH2A4 Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance]] was the first in vengeance trilogy movies by director Park Chanwook. With Oldboy being the second and [[ASIN:B000GBEWNY Lady Vengeance]] being the third.    I loved Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance. It was the first Asian drama movie I saw that wasn't about martial arts experts, renegade cops, rival gangs, crime drama, or not starring your typical action anti-hero that goes around crashing cars into helicopters. Like Oldboy, that movie had violence committed by real people in realistic ways.    In the preview trailer for Oldboy, I saw that it had more stylized violence, but not the over the top unrealistic fights or over kill gun fights of other Asian action movies.    I won't give away the movie, but I will tell you what about the Oldboy trailer made me watch it.    Basic plot as told by Oldboy trailer: A man is for apparently no reason, kidnapped, locked up for 15 years in isolation, and then released. The man then has 5 days to find out why this happened to him and who did it.    To me and most people Oldboy would seem like the movie is only about the locked up man's quest for revenge.    This might be considered a spoilers:    The truth is that the kidnapping, locking up for 15 years, and then releasing of seemingly normal man is actually part of another man's own masterminded revenge plot against the man seeking revenge on him.    Bad plot point in Oldboy:    Half way through the movie some viewers, like myself, after finding out why the 'bad guy' wants revenge on the 'good guy' he locked up, might figure out what the  villain's revenge on the hero is going be. But, knowing this didn't prepare me for how the true revenge was handled at the end.    DVD Extras:    All deleted scenes were great with great subtitled commentary from the director.  The director interview gave informative insight on the director's view on his movies.    The film's subtitled audio commentary from the film's director and cinematographer is very disappointing.  I could only tolerate watching about 20 minutes of the commentary.  The two mostly spoke about the lighting, camera work, locations, and the entire production side of the movie. They didn't speak at all about the creative side of the movie. They spoke very little about the acting. The director didn't give any insight on his message or the meaning behind the scenes being shown. For example, a scene has a man freaking out because he thinks he's covered in ants, they comment on what it took to film the scene. I stopped watching after 20 minutes of them talking about green lighting and film bleaching.

B001KVZ6F2|5.0|I enjoyed this film a lot. Clint Eastwood does a great job as both actor and director, and the story challenges to viewer - it's not regular Clint fare, but it is both entertaining and moving. The approach to an old man winding down his life, and a young man entering manhood works fantastically. Strong stuff, well worth a view.<br /><br />[[ASIN:1906669023 Sherlock Holmes and the Flying Zombie Death Monkeys]]

0786838655|4.0|I really enjoyed this series, I can't say it was better then Harry Potter, but I think this series is much more age appropriate for younger readers. Potter got very dark towards the end. These books keep you wanting more and you can't help falling in love with the characters. My only issue with the writing is how the author is always \\"reminding you about stuff\\" ex. How he has the main character always saying \\"In case you didn't know my magical sword Riptide always re-appears in my pocket no matter were I am\\". That got old, but other then that they where great!
044024367X|2.0|I had no idea this novel was part of series, much less that this was the 12th entry when I picked it up. This was not only my introduction to the Reacher character but to the writing of Lee Child as well. Thanks to a brain fart, I confused Lee Child with Lincoln Child, and wanted to see how this novel compared to the tag team novels of Preston & Child (\\"Relic\\", \\"Thunderhead\\", \\"Riptide\\" etc.). Needless to say, when I realized my mistake, I was long gone from the book store.<br /><br />So I wasn't really sure what to expect with \\"Nothing to Lose\\". I have to admit, the opening chapters caught my interest. If for no other reason than I love the film \\"First Blood\\", and \\"Nothing to Lose\\" plays out quite a bit like Stallone's first \\"Rambo\\" flick. Former armed forces guy drifting into small town, small town cops take dislike to drifter and escort him out of town, drifter doesn't like being told where he can go or what he can do and stalks back into town. The Reacher character had a bit more to say than Rambo ever did, and seems to have a few more smarts, but overall Reacher just doesn't pack the same punch.<br /><br />Apparently even fans of the Reacher series aren't real fond of this entry judging by the other reviews posted here. Having nothing to compare it with I would say \\"Nothing to Lose\\" is okay at best. The biggest problem I had with the novel is that the plot revolves around the mysterious scrap yard in the town of Despair, the novel hooks the reader by dangling this carrot for about 400 pages, and when you finally get the payoff and discover Despair's secrets, it's kind of blah. You just spent 400 pages reading and have the reaction of \\"Well, that it...lame.\\"<br /><br />Still I did like Child's writing style, and the character has promise, I will go back to the beginning of the series and give Reacher another chance to grab me.
B000VDDWDS|5.0|Okay this is one of the best sailing naval fiction movies out there. If there is a sequel hopefully with Russell Crowe, a strong Lady Lead would help the story, my circle of friends includes Katie Sackhoff whom I've met briefly at a busstop. Keira Knightly who rocks in nautical fiction in both senses of the meaning. Ashley Olsen has received a positive review from ben Kingsley lately whom would rock as Q in a bond movie. Mary Kate Olsen interests me as a strong Lady Lead for the next Aubrey adventure, Natalie Portman takes serious dramatic roles however she would excel in this part. I havre been trying to talk Pretty Brittany Ashton Holmes into returning to the big screen, Also Julia AR Morgan with the voice of an angel in front of a London Knights hockey Game of over 8000 would be great for the soundtrack or a Brent Butterworth mix of sea shanties as my friend is proficient at sampling on computer for the soundtrack. I played the Admiral in Hms Pinafore with a real sword from India, I also played Major Metcalfe in Agatha Christies the Mousetrap, and the play in 2009 with Yang Gao Zedong my Mom called Where were you the story of the Sermon on the Mount. So like Prime Minister Sir Winston Churchill anfd his daughter M double oh eights friend, I went from Admiral to Major to a cult figure. The Master and Commander bluray is awesome and has great reviews. Respect to these Women and the Aubrey naval fiction franchise
B000WS4QJG|5.0|The CD/DVD came in perfect condition. It was packaged just like if you were to buy it at a store. Everyone should own a copy of this CD/DVD. Its amazing and will go down in history as the number one selling CD of all time.
0439023491|5.0|The Hunger Games was one of those `can't eat, can't sleep, must finish' kind of books for me, so like many other fans, I could hardly wait to get my hands on Catching Fire, the sequel.  I had high expectations and was a little worried about this `middle' book not living up to them.  Boy, was I wrong to worry.<br /><br />Catching Fire surpasses The Hunger Games by a mile.  We are brought back to our heroes Katniss and Peeta a few months after they won their Hunger Games.  If their win had been as past wins were, all they'd need to worry about is getting through the Victory Tour, but unfortunately for them, their journey is not destined to be easy.  Before the tour, Katniss learns that the government is mad at the actions during the last few minutes of their Hunger Games and is warned that any wrong move will cost not only her, but everyone around her, as well.<br /><br />What transcends is a novel that truly will surprise you.  Collins takes turns that you won't see coming and, trust me, those turns are perfectly executed.  Peeta and Katniss are once again joined by a unique group of characters old and new in this most recent adventure.  Relationships are tested further to the point where, as a reader, you will choose a side.  And, again, Collins writes this gruesome reality in a very clean, non-gruesome way.<br /><br />If you loved The Hunger Games, then I know you don't care if I recommend it or not.  You already know to read it, as well you should. This novel is better than is predecessor and highly recommended.
B001FB4W0W|5.0|I've never been so excited for a new series before. I rented the first two episodes at Blockbuster and was hooked. Best purchase I've made in a long time!!!! No one will regret buying this DVD set if you like vampires, romance, sex, lust, violence, and pure horror! I almost needed a cigarette after.........and I don't smoke!!

B0000027RL|2.0|I remember well when this one came out. MTV \\"fanboys\\" immediately switched from hard rock to the grunge bandwagon hailing pearljam and the other grunge raggers as the new thing. The fact is, if you listened to ten or watched the videos you'd be asking yourself \\"what am I missing here?\\" - the musicianship is atrocious, the songs plodding, the singer's voice is monotonous yet this band behaved like they were the Doors..give us a break please    Luckily real rock music is now back and this kind of poserrock is now forgotten..same for soundgarden mudhoney stonetemple whatever...what a waste of air.....all those years..
B00005QGAV|5.0|I'd pretty much forgotten about Michael Jackson until his death.  All the media coverage made me nostalgic for him & his music.  The Dangerous album is outstanding.  What an amazing, gift Michael Jackson was to this world!  Sadly, a great gift like his often comes with an equal part of tradegy.  Hopefully this rare and sensitive soul is now at peace.

B0017HV05E|5.0|Life of Pi is one of the most profound books I've ever read.  It is a story the mirrors the path one must take on the Tree of Life.  The name of the Japanese ship alone Tsimtsum is the clue to the adventure this young boy has as he reaches for adulthood and spiritual completeness.  To begin this book requires courage....it is not like other books you have read; it is not about a culture you are familiar with.  But in the end, it is about the search we all started at birth...the maneuvering of the different paths one faces throughout life.

0545123267|4.0|Grace has always been fascinated by the wolves that roam the woods at the edge of her backyard. One in particular has always had her interested - the yellow eyed wolf that saved her six years ago from being mulled and eaten by the wolves.    She never imagined that when the wolves disappear for the warm months it was because they were human.    This becomes the epic love story of Grace and Sam, the yellow-eyed wolf turned human. Sam shows up (literally) on Grace's doorstep after hunters go into the woods to get rid of the wolves (after they \\"killed\\" the town's most popular boy). He's naked, shot, and human. Grace immediately helps him into the house and takes him to the hospital, where he tells her the truth about himself.    This starts the relationship of Grace/Sam - who spend every minute available together. And thanks to her unknowing, scatterbrained parents, she's able to keep Sam in the house without their knowledge. But their time together is growing short the colder it gets. And Sam knows this is his last year of turning.    Towards the end of the book, the plot thickens. Jack Culpepper (the bitten, \\"dead\\" human boy) thinks that Grace has a cure for turning because she was bitten and never changed. As the group of friends - Isabel (Jack's sister), Olivia (Grace's best friend) and Grace try to find a cure to keep Sam human, they realize that internal heat may be the answer. Inducing Jack with a strain of meningitis (as a human) and Sam with the same (as a wolf), they hope for the best. But when Jack dies, Grace loses all hope of Sam's return.    But as epic love stories go - he shows up at the end of the book, reunited with Grace on Christmas day.    I sincerely believe this is going to have enough hype to be deemed the next \\"Twilight\\" series. And with very good reasoning. As I was reading through this book of alternating perspectives (Grace and Sam - which helps see both sides of the story insanely well), I couldn't help but thinking that this was just likeTwilight's relationship of Bella/Edward, but a little better enhanced.    I liked this novel because it shows Sam's side of things and his thoughts instead of just assuming what he's thinking. Of course, there's also his struggle of being a human and a wolf. To Sam, the two are not interchangable, they are totally separate from each other. And since finding Grace, he wants to leave the wolf-side of him behind more than ever.    Truthfully, I found this slow reading in part for reasons unknown. I liked the book, but it didn't have the same gripping need to continue reading/havetohaveitomg that Twilight (the original book) did for me.    Definite recommendation to any fan of Twilight - this book will grab you and hold you. And possibly have you twitching until Fall 2010's sequel.

B00005LC1H|5.0|I had to permanently donate my original DVD set of Flatery Owls to a friend who, incredibly, had never seen the series, despite her self-professed love for British comedy.  She had heard of Benny Hill, Dave Allen, On The Buses, Are You Being Served, etc.  In a sense, however, I could sort of understand why.  As other reviewers have said, this is a unique series, and due to it's painfully short 12-episode duration, is not aired in the same way as others.  Here in the US, for example, it's usually shown in sequence during a one-day PBS pledge-drive.  If that's not how she watched TV, then she might indeed miss it.  But the comedy style of insults, slapstick, wittiness, double-entendres, etc, are not quite like other British sitcoms, or Monty Python or anything really:  it's a style of comedy all its own.  The closest style I might compare it too is some of the best, live-action plays I've seen, although not too many people see plays these days.  But I think it's a mistake to try to deconstruct Fawlty Towers too much in order to see what makes it so funny, because I find it ruins the fun and spontaneity.  For me, this series is simply the benchmark for the very best comedy writing I have seen, and I can watch it every year and thoroughly enjoy it (which maybe speaks little for me).  I liked Fawlty Towers as a youngster and I still like it now, even though my taste in TV and writing has changed vastly over 30 years.<br /><br />The set has several interesting interviews from the principal actors included, and compared to many modern DVD's it might provide more extras in this way, although I found myself wanting a little more than what was included.  At the time, however, I had paid $64.99 USD, while as of today, the set currently sells for around $24.  The transfer is good -- it's not HDTV, but images are crisp and colors very good, as is the sound.  If you grew up watching this on analog TV or video cassettes, it's quite a step up.  Certain fashion styles aside, the series certainly does not look it's age.  Although it might be overkill, I am hoping BBC might still consider a 1080p version of the set one day.<br /><br />Other reviews thoroughly-describe the content and pretext of the episodes.  I will only add that, if by some chance you are one of those who haven't seen Fawlty Towers yet, and enjoy comedy to any degree, you really must see this.  It's been 35 years since the first 6 episodes were made, yet I still occasionally hear people I don't know quote lines from the show...usually insults...a testament to the lasting effect the show has upon those who've seen it.  And the next time you hear someone order a Lemon Squash, or tell someone to stop talking about the war, you'll understand at least one more reason why people within earshot might start snickering.ainly does not look it's age.

B000WMA6FA|5.0|Made in 1940, this is a timeless classic. Documents hardships faced during te Oklahoma dust bowl. Its an emotional, gut wrenching story. Directed by John Ford and starring Henry Fonda at his best. If you like good movies, this one is a \\"gotta see!
0316044695|5.0|Well written and a great story. A little long but does a great job of explaining how SEALS become SEALS. Once the action started I couldn't put the book down. Great to see the heroism being exhibited in our conflicts overseas.
B0015DWJX2|5.0|This is the one of the sweetest and funniest books I have read in a long time!  The conceit of telling the whole story through the letters written by the characters to each other is utterly charming.  The main character is a journalist/book author in London in 1946 who writes the most wonderful letters ... most of us have forgotten how to do that (if we ever knew), who begins a correspondence with a man who got his hands on a book that she had purged from her library.  The correspondence expands to all of his friends and neighbors on the Channel island of Guernsey and contains a very interesting history of the occupation of the island by the Nazis during WWII.<br /><br />The characters are charming and funny and the several threads of the story are all neatly and sweetly bound together at the end.  If yiu want to read a book that will carry you back to a time gone by and that will make you smile and feel good, try this one.  You won't be sorry!
0802798225|5.0|I read many romance books but hardly ever write a review.  I really loved this book and wanted to say if you are thinking about reading this book, just do it!  From the way the author writes I really felt like I knew these two main characters.  You get into their heads and you really feel a connection.  This is my first book by this author and I will be keeping an eye out for more to come.
0061120081|5.0|After reading this story few people are so enchanted that they have burlesqued title \\"To kill a mockingbird\\" to express their predicaments. Quite recently one of my friends who was preparing for GMAT CAT exam clearly changed his signature to \\"To kill a mockingCAT\\". Well, indeed story held lot many things from several dimensions such as humanity, relation, occupation etc and every time people are behaving differently based on their vicinity and consequences.  I think it's a good read for elder reader too.

Its exactly what you would expect from a great action movie. The charcaters they picked to play the characters are perfect! The CGI is amazing and its a thrill ride I will not soon forget!! I havnt bought a blu-ray player yet, but this movie may make me buy one!! If you see one Action movie this year make it GI-JOE!!!! It brings \\"Guy Movie\\" to a whole new level! Dont miss this movie at the theator! The explosions and action sequences are incredible!
B0029NY9YO|5.0|Not being familiar with the original graphic novel as I was with The Dark Knight I didn't have any expectations for this movie, but it far surpassed any I might have had. This is just a tremendously entertaining, hard-hitting, and dynamic movie, and at about 2 hours and 40 minutes, of truly epic proportions.<br /><br />It's also very gritty, violent, and with a number of adult scenes, so it might not be appropriate for the whole family.<br /><br />I'm sure the fans will have their bones to pick, but I couldn't find any serious shortcomings in the entire movie. Everything is just solid--the story, the script, the acting, and special effects. Not being able to speak with any authority about faithfulness to the original, I'll stick to a few comments about the movie itself.<br /><br />The series of lead-in scenes with the alternative history of a number of famous and iconic events is possibly the greatest movie lead-in I've seen. It's a brilliant start to a brilliant movie. And they go on for seemingly ten or fifteen minutes. And whoever the cinematographer was, he's truly an artist with the camera, creating many stunning shots and sequences. So the movie has tremendous visual appeal in addition to its other many strengths and attractions.<br /><br />All the actors were great in their roles, and not knowing the original characters I can't fault anything there. But overall the quality of the acting seemed excellent.<br /><br />As far as the quality of the video transfer goes, again I'm no expert, but I can say that on my 48-inch Samsung HD TV the quality seemed just fine. This DVD isn't a high-def transfer but it looked quite good on my TV, but it has internal upscaling and also I have an audio-visual processor, which, while not super-high end, is supposed to be decent, so that might account for video quality.<br /><br />The movie builds up to a dramatic climax, which is certainly a bittersweet one, but so as not to mention any spoilers I'll leave it at that. Overall, I think this is the best super hero movie of all time and one of the best movies of the year.ime and one of the best movies of the year.

B00127RAJY|5.0|I just finished level one - the beginner level - of Jillian Micheal's exercise DVD, Shredded. To say I worked up a sweat would be a major understatement. As I lay on the floor recovering, my dog came up to me and licked my face like I was a salt block and he was a deer.      I'm pretty sure that when the carpet dries, there will be a salt outline of my body where I was laying in exhaustion. I just got up and down off the floor more times in that 20 minutes than in the last 20 days. This woman is brutal and I don't know about the pounds, but my muscles certainly feel shredded. I can't even begin to imagine what Level 3 is like.     Seriously, 20 minutes later, I still have sweat rolling off my body. This IS A WORKOUT if you aren't used to working out.  Go for it!

B00180R06I|5.0|This is a beautiful film and it's all in the creation of the atmosphere: The boatman with the sickle, the small hotel with dreary pictures, the wide-eyed, suited visitor that will be our protagonist, the shots of the park/forest....  This movie makes the objects participate too and in that respect the aesthetic is thoroughly Surreal and not Gothic. This work is very much in tune with the work of Max Ernst and Magritte, and most of all, Delvaux.  The plot is simple and the suspense is well maintained. The movie works, because very much like \\"Nosferatu\\" it suggests so much more than is visible at any point in the scenes. In that respect particularly it stands at the opposite end of the spectrum from the later, cheaper Dracula movies that have tons of blood and gore. Here a few drops suggest an entire calamity  Although there is sound it is so seldomly and sparely used it is really more like a silent film. The camera works in a way that we believe to be exploring with the visitor, so we are totally involved in the plot, which ends up, surprisingly,  having a happy ending.
B001AVCFJM|5.0|They hit a homerun on this one. The casting is fantastic. The story is great and they give it enough room to be its own movie with its own reality for a new story and for future new stories. I loved it. Chris Pine was Kirk! Two thumbs up!

B000GRTQXY|4.0|While certainly not their best album (Screamadelica, Vanishing Point and XTRMNTR, depending on your point of view) it is a pretty good rock n roll album and much better than Give Out But Don't Give Up.  This is basically their 2nd attempt at the southern boogie sound of the 70's and for fans of their dark dub/electronica it will be frustrating.  The best songs on it are Country Girl and Dolls, which ROCKS regardless of your opinion of their direction on this record.

B002E2QHBS|5.0|This is a great big and ambitious 6 CD box set with nearly 8 hours of music here, they wanted to compile everything from this event on to 30 CDs but that could not be done for some reason. For those of you like myself who have Woodstock 1&2, the 25th anniversary boxset and also Woodstock Diary and are thinking about trading them off for this, hang on to them because they have several songs on them that are not included here. But nevertheless this is still a great collectors item of this recorded landmark event from August 1969.
B002DZX94Y|5.0|Imitating the format of DG's earlier collection of Argerich's complete solo albums, here in crhonological order from 1967 to 2004 we get her concerto recordings. All are self-recommending to her legion of fans and highly recommended by critics, which poses a problem for many collectors. I already own all but a handful, so even DG's bargain price isn't all that tempting. The duplications consist of the Ravel Concerto in G (both versions are about eqaul, the later one iwth the London Sym. has more vivid, forward sound), the Beethoven Concerto no. 2 (I prefer the earlier one with Sinopoli over the chamber-sized, quasi-period version with Abbado), and the Tchaikovsky First (Abbado and Berlin hands down for orchestral execution and more fire from Argerich).<br /><br />But the tale isn't that simple, either, since Argerich has also duplicated some of these pieces on other labels. There's a recent Shostakovich First on EMI that is heavier and almost grave compared to the earlier one. Both of her other Schumann concertos, on EMI and Teldec, seem more energized and sympathetic than the one here, where Rostropovich's accompaniment is a bit clumsy.  The third vesion of the Tchaikovsky First with Chailly on Philips, coupled with the Rachmaninov Third, is a barn buner of a live performance. Among the commerical rcordings I also wouldn't be without her Prokofiev First on EMI, or both Chopin concertos with Dutoit on the same label, and then one can delve into pirate labels, who offer extensive additions.<br /><br />I may have muddied the waters more than cleared them, so here's a lineup of what this box set contains:<br /><br />Beethoven:<br /> Piano Concerto No. 1 in C Major, Op. 15<br /><br />Philharmonia Orchestra, Giuseppe Sinopoli<br /><br />Piano Concerto No. 2 in B flat major, Op. 19<br /><br />Philharmonia Orchestra & Philharmonia Hungarica, Giuseppe Sinopoli<br /><br />Piano Concerto No. 3 in C minor, Op. 37<br /><br />Mahler Chamber Orchestra, Claudio Abbado<br /><br />Piano Concerto No. 2 in B flat major, Op. 19<br /><br />Mahler Chamber Orchestra, Claudio Abbado<br /><br />Chopin:<br /> Piano Concerto No. 1 in E minor, Op. 11<br /><br />London Symphony Orchestra, Claudio Abbado<br /><br />Piano Concerto No. 2 in F minor, Op. 21<br /><br />National Symphony Orchestra Washington, Mstislav Rostropovich<br /><br />Haydn:<br /> Piano Concerto No. 11 in D major, HobXVIII:11<br /><br />W&uuml;rttembergisches Kammerorchester Heilbronn, J&ouml;rg Faerber<br /><br />Liszt:<br /> Piano Concerto No. 1 in E flat major, S124<br /><br />London Symphony Orchestra, Claudio Abbado<br /><br />Mendelssohn:<br /> Concerto in D minor for Violin, Piano and String Orchestra<br /><br />Gidon Kremer (violin)<br /><br />Orpheus Chamber Orchestra<br /><br />Prokofiev:<br /> Piano Concerto No. 3 in C major, Op. 26<br /><br />Berliner Philharmoniker, Claudio Abbado<br /><br />Ravel:<br /> Piano Concerto in G major<br /><br />Berliner Philharmoniker, Claudio Abbado<br /><br />Piano Concerto in G major<br /><br />London Symphony Orchestra, Claudio Abbado<br /><br />Schumann:<br /> Piano Concerto in A minor, Op. 54<br /><br />National Symphony Orchestra Washington, Mstislav Rostropovich<br /><br />Shostakovich:<br /> Piano Concerto No. 1 in C minor for piano, trumpet & strings, Op. 35<br /><br />Guy Touvron<br /><br />W&uuml;rttembergisches Kammerorchester Heilbronn, J&ouml;rg Faerber<br /><br />Tchaikovsky:<br /> Piano Concerto No. 1 in B flat minor, Op. 23<br /><br />Royal Philharmonic Orchestra, Charles Dutoit<br /><br />Piano Concerto No. 1 in B flat minor, Op. 23<br /><br />Berliner Philharmoniker, Claudio Abbado<br /><br />As you can see, nothing is off the beaten path except for the Mendelssohn with Gidon Kremer, not exactly a masterpiece. I've seen quibles about Argerich's Haydn concerto, which I thought was sparkling and brilliant. I wish she was as imaginative and charming in her early Beethoven concertos, but others will disagree. In any event, this second catch-all contains first-rate pianism from first to last, so the only question is how much of it you already own.
B000002KIK|3.0|To really review this album fairly, one must first understand some of the issues with its initial development (which allow us to better rate this album and how it fares when compared to the rest of their work).  Ozzy was largely refusing to spend time in the studio with the band - so much of the work on Never Say Die! is actually done in one take.  There were plans for Ozzy to step aside allowing another singer to come in..and the music was initially written for him.  Ozzy decided to participate and so many of the songs' lyrics were changed just prior to production.  In addition, the band was internally reeling from debate over whether they'd really played to the best of their abilites on the preceding album (Technical Ecstasy); an LP Tony Iommi was tremendously dissatisfied with (he wasn't a big proponent of changing their sound too much but supposedly Ozzy and Bill Ward wanted to experiment more musically akin to what Led Zeppelin had done).      The result of this turmoil was an experimental album (by Sabbath standards) that is altogether more 'cheerful' than their famous doom and gloom albums ... but also returned them to some of their more bluesy roots like those seen on their first two albums.  Ozzy even plays harmonica on Swinging the Chain (and tears it up nicely).  Breakout and Swinging the Chain are really the most significant drivers of debate about this album.  Breakout (which is more like an extended prologue to 'Swinging') includes sax and a full horn section...all of which were unexpected for a band like Sabbath.  And most notably, Swinging the Chain is famous for being the final track recorded during the Ozzy years...but does NOT feature Ozzy singing (instead, he plays harmonica and the drummer Bill Ward sang).  There's considerable argument about whether Bill can sing...for my part, I actually find the first 2/3 of this song to be among the best moments on this album...but a bizarre time shift occurs which provides a jarring conclusion to this song(as if they melded two totally disparate songs together).    This isn't Sabbaths best work.  That much is clear...but what might surprise you is how some of the tracks seem more inventive and relevant over time - and make for an enjoyable listening experience.
B000A2RRF4|5.0|The Dangerous Tour DVD is the best of Michael's performance, I've seen live in japan, and compared them, but with this one he Perfected his performance, that's what makes it the best, I give this a five star.
0307266303|5.0|I relished every single second of this book and will start re-reading it today just to relish it all over again.  I've suffered from running injury after running injury the past couple years and it was a big 'aha' moment for me reading this book.  I am working on my running stride and even have gone on a few barefoot runs that made me feel like a very happy kid again.    I would recommend this book to anyone, even if you are not a runner.

B001FB55H6|1.0|This movie has nothing going for it. The story is boring their are no likeable characters. Every time their is any action the sound goes way up to a point you have to turn it down then back up again to hear the dialoge. I think the movie sucks.
0399215921|3.0|Call me crazy, but I just don't share the wild enthusiasm most people seem to have for everything Eric Carle writes. His illustrations are wonderful, but the writing is very sub-par in many cases. I consider THE VERY HUNGRY CATERPILLAR an exception. Like with some of his other books, this one about the very busy spider is extremely repetitive. The right-side page is exactly the same for most of the book. Is there some benefit to this repetition that I'm missing? Seems like it wouldn't be that hard to liven up the description of the spider spinning her web, infusing a new tweak on each 2-page spread.    The inclusion of a variety of animals and their sounds is great (and those are the pages that grab the attention of my 15-month old son), and it's for that reason, as well as the excellent quality of the illustrations, that I give the book 3 stars as opposed to fewer. If you're interested in an Eric Carle-illustrated book with a clever narrative, check out THE FOOLISH TORTOISE with text written by Richard Buckley.
1416550542|4.0|This engrossing book takes place in Australia and England and moves back and forth with narrations about women who come from several generations in one family.  We are introduced to young Nell who takes a mysterious journey on a ship when she is 4 years old and is then unaccountably abandoned to a life with people who are only interested in what she can earn for them.  The book also includes Nell's granddaughter Cassandra, who tirelessly seeks answers to the mysteries of her grandmother's origins and her abondonment on a wharf in England.  The author goes back before Nell's birth and layer by layer uncovers the secrets which have long been hidden because of family pride and various misfortunes.  Woven into the story are fairy tales written by a family member which include thinly veiled references to her life and the mysteries which surround it.
B001TODCII|5.0|pleasant surprise, edge-of-your-seat action. 90min seems short(especially with long beginning), but the movie was nicely paced throughout. Definite rent.
B0025VLELQ|4.0|The Last Starfighter is essentially a space opera hinged on the fantasy that video game skills will save the day. Obviously this movie was made for the young teen crowd (essentially 13 yr old boys with Ataris/ Intelivisions/ColecoVisions/etc) and has its share of action and comedy that, like most space operas in the 80's, has more than one similarity to Star Wars (but then again Star Wars was a homage to the classic space operas of the golden age of television). So it's not high caliber sci-fi, but it's not B-movie fodder either.     The story is pretty simple: Evil leader of evil aliens wants to attack good aliens, so in walks a single hero who is the last hope for freedom. That's about it. The movie doesn't deviate too far from this premise other than to further flesh out the fish-out-of-water scenario of an 80's Earthling thrust into space (as well as a little fun with an alien in 80's Earth) as well as the inner battle of said Earthling to stay and fight for a Star League he doesn't know or stay home and go to community college. A serviceable story, if not deep.     The acting does make the simple story enjoyable to watch. Lance Guest seems to have fun with the role, which works for the character. Biggest props go to esteemed Robert Preston's Centauri, who plays the role with the style of a magician and the charisma P.T. Barnum. Another esteemed actor, Dan O'Herlihy, does a surprisingly good performance. Especially when you consider he is wearing full prosthetics with less facial mobility than the costumes from the original Planet of the Apes. Yeah there is a bit of theatrical \\"drama\\", but that works with the whole space opera motif.     Special effects are a benchmark here because this is the first film to incorporate live action elements to computer generated animation. The CGA is pretty barbaric by today's standards and even back then was noticeable. The biggest glare in this are the scenes flying in around asteroids, which look pretty \\"plastic\\" CG-wise. However the CG ships looked awesome and you can't beat the camera angles and fly-byes that computer animation affords. Plus back then this was pretty state of the art.     The original DVD was released years ago and not too long ago an HD-DVD release was done. Both were pretty good in their format, but this Blu-Ray is a true remastering of the movie. It's a MPEG-4 codec on a BD-25 (25 gigabyte single layer Blu-ray Disc) in the 2.35:1 aspect ratio. It looks like a lot of the grain was taken out too, and for some that could be annoying if you are really into the true theater look. Still the images are a good deal sharper and look better than any previous release (including the HD-DVD release). The CG effects really stand out, and while I liked it that aspect also separated those scenes more from the live action shots as far as differences in detail, color and lighting. All in all it's a great transfer/remaster in spite of it not being perfect (then again how many 15 year old movies can really stand up to current digital transfers?).    The Blu-Ray comes with the same features as the DVD release only the new documentary is in high definition and you get a few Blu-Ray centric features like BDLive and D-Box compatibility (that's a motion control chair that responds to queues from the movie). Extras are as follows:      Commentary with director Nick Castle and production designer Ron Cobb - It's informative and entertaining hearing the two banter between each other. You can tell they enjoyed making this movie.     Crossing the Frontier: Making The Last Starfighter - This was in the original DVD release. Lance Guest hosts this half hour documentary going behind the scenes on the technical and other aspects of the movie.     Heroes of the Screen (in HD) - Essentially interviews with cast and crew talking about how the movie was made and how they felt about the production.     DTS-HD 5.1 in English and subtitled in English (SDH), Spanish and French - Can't speak for the accuracyof the subtitles, but the English audio sounds great. Not a whole lot of surround sound stuff going on, but then again this is an older movie.     Theatrical and teaser trailer - Standard definition. Not much to say here.     Image gallery - Includes rare production photos, promotional stuff and content from an alternate ending.     This movie is definitely a time capsule for 80's science fiction and is very much a product of that time. If you like that sort of charm then by all means pick this one up. If you already have the original DVD you were definitely enjoy the updated visuals and sound as well as the new interviews. It's worth the double dip.
0312427999|5.0|This book is well written and well researched. It is an easy read. It will change the way you'll look at the world...but be ready for a shock. I highly recommend this book.
B00005JKNC|4.0|\\"The Majestic\\" is one of Jim Carrey's most interesting films.  Once again, he plays a straight-faced character (The Truman Show and Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind) and leaves the comic shtick aside for this 2001 sleeper.  Carrey plays Peter Appleton a Hollywood screenwriter who happens to be blacklisted during the 1950s Communist Scare McCarthy-era and who's life takes an enormous turn while making an evening drive, he attempts to avoid running over a possum.  It is after that event that the film emerges into something out of a Frank Capra film a la \\"It's a Wonderful Life\\" with its subtle tint of patriotism and mega dose of nostalgia.<br /><br />With that element in mind, there are interesting aspects within the storyline that highlight the film.  Carrey's character loses his memory and the people of the small town of Lawson takes him in as their own, especially Martin Landau's character, Harry Trimble, who thinks as well as the rest of the townspeople that Peter is his son Luke, the hometown boy who has been missing for nine years possibly during the War in the Pacific.  Also, Adele Stanton played by Laurie Stanton, the girl he left behind has still left the light on for Luke, so to speak, which adds a bit of romance within the movie.  But most importantly, the human condition that has been displayed in most Capra films.<br /><br />Overall, \\"The Majestic\\" was an enlightening film to watch despite it running a little over two hours.  And this only goes to show that Hollywood can still produce films that hit a soft spot.
B001PPLJIQ|5.0|Once the viewer has travelled past the stage-setting erotic images, the angst of the heroine becomes very vivid. Hers is a supremely formidable intellect shackeled by the inability to READ!! Ther is also a smidgeon of \\"Third Reich\\" mystic in her initial defense of the total lack of empathy shown to the early incineration of the victims of the \\"Final Solution\\" with which she is charged. The contrast of the failure of her lover to attempt any rescue is also descriptive of post-WW2 Germany. The cinematography is  excellent, but the time shifting can be a little confusing. In total, the film-and Winslet's portrail--are Oscar-worthy.
B001UV4XU6|4.0|500 Days of Summer is a quirky little film that centers on the complexities of relationships.  Tom Hansen (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) and Summer Finn (Zooey Deschanel) are two people who work for the New Hampshire Greeting Cards Company who happen to strike a friendship that goes beyond casual.  Summer is up front about not forging a serious relationship but Tom already has preconceived notions that he is going to make this a long-term affair.  And with that in mind, the complexities begin.<br /><br />The film intermittently goes through the 500 days in which the couple is involved.  From the honeymoon stage to the final disintegration of their bond, what boils down to a friendship becomes Tom's obsession that dwells on two premises, expectations and reality.  With humor and subtle serious moments, the movie flows quite nicely.  The most interesting part of the film is the humor that overshadows various scenes showing Tom's disappointment, such as he being counseled by his little sister, Rachel (Chloe Grace Moretz) for relationship advice despite she looking somewhat of pre-pubescent age and the short vignettes that play on classic foreign films, Ingmar Bergman's Seventh Sign and Jean Luc-Goddard's Breathless and the song and dance number to a Hall and Oates tune, and the karaoke scenes.<br /><br />500 Days of Summer is by no means an artsy film but rather an intelligently done independent film that observes the ups and downs of Tom and Summer's year and a half long romance.  Overall, Mark Water's production and Scott Neustadter and Michael H. Weber's screenplay and the various songs from The Smiths and other independent-alternative bands and artists complement the film's soundtrack as well.  Indeed, this is a film worth watching.
0345479092|5.0|I bought this book for my son and daughter-in law, whose band-new baby was not sleeping.... They loved the book and say how helpful it is to see things from the baby's perspective.... you'll be glad to know that seven-week-old Arlo is now sleeping really well and making good progress in every other way too.
B001TH28EO|5.0|Most of the performances are top notch. Some are only good. The recordings are mostly 70s and early 80s, so in some cases are not up to more recent ones, but none is bad and most are good. I like Fischer-Dieskau's earlier EMI lieder recordings, but these are fine. The chamber and choral music stuff is all really good. I like the Karajan symphonies but if you are a Karajan hater, well you already own a different set of them.
B001G0MFOM|5.0|I have always been a fan of the l word, even though I'm a man. I loved every minute of the 1st season, then the 2nd season turned me off due to Jenny's ugly haircut, the the 3rd season really made me mad because of Dana's death. The 4th season was just boring to me. In the 5th season, I got real tired of seeing the endless love scenes. When Six came around, I realized it was my favorite season since the first and I loved it. Personally, I think that Jenny committed suicide. I mean, she was a human car crash. I will definitely miss this drama.
B000SQJ27I|3.0|I LOVE Manu. He's definitely one of the most original artist around. I was real excited about this release but unfortunately, I think it was rushed. Most of the the tunes don't have the soul and flava of his previously released albums.
B000W9EOEC|5.0|This CD captures two things:  - a great, great live electronic show  - an excellent band at the peak of their skill  The dynamism that emanates from this set via the CD is second only to actually seeing the set in person. This recording captures the build, blend, and drive of good electronic music so well that after listening to it you'll look at many other DJ CDs in your collection in a new (less than flattering) light.    What Daft Punk have created is nothing less than the zeitgeist of 2007/2008 electronic music. If only one could record and experience the light show that went with this concert in full effect; then the experience would be complete.
B0012CCNUU|5.0|Great music never goes outa style. This was a good example of how to keep listening when the old vinyl goes bad.
B001NXDSLG|3.0|I think for many people interested in acquiring some of the 40th anniversary products, the comparison between the earlier releases is almost as important as the \\"feature\\" itself.  I'm born a fair bit after Woodstock, but still will watch this at least 2 or 3 times a year (still finding more people to inflict it on); time  has given the movie a cultural relevance - and the music - Jimi, Sly, the Who, Santana - at their peak.  What's not to love? The feature still gets 5 stars.    The release on the other hand - only three.  Unlike some other reviewers, I have no issue with the picture, and very little with the sound quality. Everyone has a view on the re-recording.  It seems to me that in the case of official live recordings, there has always been a little give in take, sacrificing historical accuracy for a better audio experience.  The line is obviously blurry, but re-doing something 40 years after the event by a non-performer?  Too much brown acid, man.    Second, the differing exclusive ultimate editions.  These things aren't cheap.  I just find it aggravating that there is apparently (hard for me to tell) a Wal-mart or something version including items that are not on the Amazon set.  I stand to be corrected on this, but until then, it seems to me that this is treating a pretty interested, completist customer base with contempt.    Next, the bonus features.  I don't understand why they weren't presented in HD.  If you go the trouble of selecting the additonal performances and mastering the main movie, why not the extra features?  It could be done with so little extra effort.    Finally, it would be nice to have seen the Band.  No demerits for this omission; it's not the fault of the moviemakers or studios, and the Band have never been in the movie, but it would still make the experience better.    I liked the LIFE reprint, and seeing Johnny Winter and CCR. If you are an enthusiast, this is still the set to get.  The rating is hovering between three and four stars, but the SD bonus features make it a three.
B001FB4W0W|5.0|This series is sooo good, I subscribed to HBO just so I could watch the second season as it unfolded.  I have pre-ordered the second season, bought the soundtrack CD and am now in the process of reading all the books (I'm now on book five) which are just as good as the series even if they are not a mirror image.  I recommend this series to anyone who likes to laugh, cry or just have a bloody good time!  [[ASIN:B001FB4W0W True Blood: The Complete First Season (HBO Series)]]
0393061310|5.0|Diamond has omitted a very crucial aspect of germs: How did Changez Khan, a desert dweller, The armies of Early desert dwelling Muslims, The Aryans of the cold deserts of Central Asia all overpower and conquer big, huge and very powerful civilizations of their times?     Civilizations originated near rivers and in warm places on earth. Moisture and warmth can support huge masses of humans as well as house flies, mosquitoes and other insects that cause diseases of crowds like malaria, cholera, TB etc. These diseases cause so many deaths among people of densely populated civilizations that the surviving masses are left with plenty of food to eat and therefore they don't have to fight to snatch food for survival.     In deserts the situation is entirely the opposite. There is very little moisture. Temperatures are extremely hot or cold. Land is mostly barren. And there is very little food there. Such habitats are not suitable for insects and there are not many house flies and mosquitoes around and consequently diseases and epidemics are not so common there.     But humans do live there on those very scarce resources that deserts can offer. In the absence of killing diseases they multiply like rabbits and soon would die en masse if nature hadn't evolved for them another mechanism of balancing the population with the, more or less, constant and meager resources of the deserts: Constant warfare, killing and looting.     You will never find centralized governments in deserts that are and remain isolated from large civilizations. Small tribes and clans live in a tribal system under laws customs and traditions which are there to promote and glorify fighting and killing and looting. The desert therefore becomes a natural training ground where all the male populations are transformed into very good warriors and fearless soldiers.     These warriors though are confined to inter tribal warfare inside the desert itself and civilizations outside are immune to their destructive power for hundreds of years until a great man is born among them in whom are combined exceptional leadership skills with those of a warrior general.     If and whenever this leader succeeds to pull out his desert men from internal conflicts and unites them under a single flag, he is ready to march his armies out of the deserts and out of hunger to annihilate the well fed and soft and clumsy armies of large civilization and to conquer, plunder and loot.     Changez Khan of The Mongols was such a great leader. So was Mohammad (Peace Be Upon Him), the prophet of Islam. And, so was HE who led the Aryans out of the cold deserts of Central Asia and Massacred and annihilated the indigenous populations of India and settled his own people there as the new and permanent inhabitants.     This pattern is so regular that it was worthy of mention by Jared diamond.   The pattern of desert dwelling peoples fighting internally for hundreds of years to become hardened killing machines and then come out of the desert under the leadership of a great leader to subjugate rich and haughty civilizations   This regular pattern of civilizations succumbing to the onslaught of united nomads' armies started from the very first civilization of Mesopotamia and carried on for the next ten thousand years until Changez Khan.     Now though civilization has grown out of its infancy and has entered into its phase of maturity since the renaissance of Europe which saw an explosion in education, science, technology and industrialization. Whereas previously there was not much difference in the types of weapons with which both sides fought against each other, deserts men vs. civilizations' armies and the bravery and chivalry of individual soldiers engaged in face to face combat that decided victory and defeat, now it's the superior technology of weapons that alone decides who will win if these two old enemies march into the battlefield in these modern times. Civilizations have discovered the institutions of schools, colleges, universities, research laboratories, factories and big industrial set ups along with many other important institutions that, working together, keep supplying ever more and more advanced weapons of combat to their own armies thereby giving them the edge and advantage over desert peoples who just don't have the resources and the manpower to build this huge and resource hungry set up.  Ten thousand years after its birth civilization has at the long last won this war once and forever against the allied armies of desert nomads.  It has forever become immune to the power of nomads who get united under great leaderships.    Now it is civilization against civilization in the battlefield that poses the greatest threat ever to our planet and our very survival.  However this fact too is evolving towards betterment albeit at a snail's pace.    Despite this one single and yet a very serious shortcoming \\"Guns Germs and Steel\\" is one of my best reads for many years to come.
0307277887|3.0|In 2008 I had only recently gotten into the Dexter craze; my cousin-in-law was CRAZY obsessed with the show and lots of my friends were telling me \\"Dude, you HAVE to see this awesome show called Dexter\\". So taking their advice, I went and watched the show... I rented the first season from the video store and watched it in a week. After seeing it, I was addicted. Then I went online and watched the entire second season online, and loved it even more. I caught season 3 in it's probably the best yet. This year I decided to go back and buy all three books and read them. I started with this one.<br /><br />If you've seen the show you basically know what to expect:<br /><br />Dexter is a charming young man who works as a blood splatter expert in the Forensics Department of the Miami Police Department. He has a beautiful (but whiny and bitchy as hell) girlfriend named Rita, who was abused in the past by her ex -husband. He was adopted into a family after his parents died, and has a foster sister named Deborah, who is a tough as nails cop.<br /><br />However there's a dark side to Dexy. He's really not who you think he is. He HATES serial killers. And I mean REALLY hates them. As contradictory as it may sound, he IS one. That is... a serial killer who kills only serial killers. He believes in getting rid of bad people.<br /><br />There's this one killer out there, and his name is the Ice Cream Truck killer. He has a vastly unique way of killing people, AND dismembering. He leaves no blood on and/or around the body. It's all cleaned out. He leaves his status cleared so he can't be found or traced by the police.<br /><br />Overall it's an interesting read. Though definitely not as good as the show. While the story is entertaining it's deeply flawed- there a re a few plot holes that could use a bit of filling.<br /><br />Also, the writing is piss poor. Lindsay repeats himself a LOT. Every chapter we get 3 paragraphs where Dexter says that he's emotionally dead inside. Even further, he always spends paragraphs describing things. This could have been 220 pages if it wasn't so slow. But no, Lindsay had to flesh it out with detailed descriptions of things and repeats.<br /><br />In short it's not a bad book, but be warned of the flaws.ings.

B001C3KCSY|1.0|I was a great fan from nearly the beginning of their career; reading all the interviews and almost thanking God that some element of old fashioned rough-rowdery had made its way into the hipster 21st century (regretfully, my own generation). Album after album, concert after concert, they stood to be, in my opinion, the best show out there in entertainment. The quirky and rough sound was powerfully magnetic. And then this happened. I guess we've all seen it before, you know. One small whiff at fame and fortune and talent flies out the window, and a stylist and a big label replace that talent. I'm not being some \\"indie\\"-guru who gets violently angry when any song or artist that they like experiences success or exposure (ex: The OC), it's all good and fun that they are experiencing success, but they've definitely sold their heart and soul to get it. This album is nothing but fluff; radio-worthy catchy glam rock sung in a (nearly muted) southern accent.     RIP, Kings of Leon. I'm not expecting a comeback from this.
B0000DJE9R|1.0|I have bought hundreds of movies from Amazon and this is the first time I received one that was in \\"new condition\\" and the worst quality!<br /><br />The low quality reproduction and pixelataton was so bad I could not watch it. Then the audio/video tracks were \\"off\\" - lip movement and sound does not match up. Very disappointed to the point that I will not buy any more videos from Amazon.<br /><br />Can Amazon make this right? - you betcha- send me a new DVD of better quality!

B001FB55H6|5.0|I had no history with the Watchmen comics, so I expected to be lost.  Now I can't say I picked everything up through the first watching, but I wasn't lost.  Repeated watchings helped clarify some things and only made it richer.  The features--particularly the \\"in movie commentary\\" feature--are pretty good.    But I'm here to talk about the MOVIE.  Some have bashed the packaging, claiming there's a 45-disc uber-geek box set coming out for Christmaas that EVERYONE should buy.  Look, this movie was already pretty long.  I don't need the \\"definitive\\" version and I don't care about the ship story or whatever.    The bottom line is, this was even better than The Dark Knight.  The cinematography, the music, the STORY . . I loved it.  It came out of nowhere and blew me away.  I knew I was going to love it right from the credits.    The ending was very poetic and moving--I was genuinely affected by Rorschack's fate.  It's not a movie that leaves you with easy answers.  It's conflicted, in a way that The Dark Knight was conflicted, even more so.      It is certainly long and measured and doesn't really get \\"going\\" with the plot for a couple of hours.  A lot of it is just backstory and flashback to fill out the characters.  But the movie is stunningly beautiful and I think we have a great new director here.

0385247125|5.0|I have read this book a few times and will be.. many more times..!    This is Michael Jackson's autobiography describing his early days-1988 era (this book was first published in 1988). He mentions that he wanted to write this book as he tells stories. That is why when I read this book I feel like MJ was in front of me telling me his great chapters of his life (Chapter 1: Just kids with a dream, Chapter 2: The promised land, Chapter 3: Dancing Machine, Chapter 4: Me and Q, Chapter 5: The Moonwalk, Chapter 6: All you need is love). The whole writings, generally in my personal impression, are about his journey from each success he made from the early The Jacksons Five era, The Jacksons 5, back to The Jacksons to his own career (making Off The Wall, Thriller and Bad albums); including Victory Tour. How he tells the readers a great outcome comes from a great work is amazing. The great works are so great so that I can't tell with any amazing words here. For example, he tells the making of Thriller Album with massive works.     When he tells about his family life, he tells it by convincing the readers how normal and natural the family life is just like others.. like mine.. it's the dynamic of hate-love, hate-apology, sweetness-bitterness.. a painting of life. I love when I read how he describes his sister 'LaToya', it's just the way an ordinary brother telling about his sister.. so natural.. In most of my time reading his family life, I was.. smiling and laughing imagining I did the same things with my sisters and brothers.. while wondering why people think he hates his father.. Why people could ever judge this special person in any way when he really grasps what other special persons' wisdoms of life and become his favourite quotations (printed in the page about his favourite quotations):    'When I want to discover something, I begin by reading up everything that has been done along that line in the past -- that's what all the books in the library are for. I see what has been accomplished at great labor and expense in the past. I gather the data of many thousands more. The three essentials to achieve anything worthwile are, first, hard work; second, stick-to-it-iveness; third, common sense' (Thomas Edison).    He reflected this quotation when Oprah Winfrey ask him in her Talkshow (10th February 1993) what he achieved at his 30th of age and he simply said \\"I am still learning..\\" Then.. why people could ever judge this special person in any way when he presents and acknowledges his mother in this book for having taught him so much about life and love, doing things by hearts, thanking God for his talent and.. giving back.
1439138311|5.0|It's 1950 and there's no work for the likes of Eilis Lacey, a quiet, intelligent, working-class girl in small-town Enniscorthy, Ireland. Her father dead and her brothers having gone off to Liverpool for work, Eilis lives with her mother and her glamorous, self-assured older sister, Rose, who works as a secretary.<br /><br />When Eilis completes her bookkeeping course and lands nothing better than one day a week at a local grocery run by a snooty spinster, Rose decides it's time her younger sister made the big leap - across the pond to Brooklyn. Using the Irish network of Church and immigrant community, Rose procures her a job and a room in a women's' boarding house.<br /><br />Reluctant, shy and lonely, Eilis keeps pretty much to herself. Competent and polite, she makes a good impression on her superiors at work and her landlady, while the other tenants make half-hearted attempts to enlist her in their shifting and often mean-spirited alliances.<br /><br />Quietly unhappy, Rose soldiers on, keeping her alienation at bay until she gets her first letters from home and plunges into a debilitating bout of homesickness.<br /><br />The floor manager at the Italian-owned clothing store where she works notices the change and takes her aside. It won't do to have one of their salesgirls looking bereft. Eilis answers her questions simply and soon realizes she won't be fired.<br /><br />\\"As a result, she was almost proud of how she had managed Miss Fortini, letting her ask all the questions and answering as little as she could, but enough not to seem surly or ungrateful. She felt almost strong as she contemplated what had just happened and she resolved that no matter who came into the room now, even if were Mr. Bartocci himself, she would be able to elicit their sympathy.\\"<br /><br />Eilis does not intend dishonesty: \\"But she could not tell them that she dreaded their shop and their customers, and that she hated Mrs. Kehoe's house, and there was nothing any of them could do for her.\\"<br /><br />From this low point, a turning point. The priest in charge of her welfare enrolls her in a business class at night. Without meaning to do anything but get through each day, Eilis says little and lets people believe pretty much what they want. What was a tendency in her self-effacing nature becomes a tactic, a means of eliciting good will and approval, if not friendship and intimacy.<br /><br />She still does a lot of things she doesn't want to, in the spirit of going along to get along, but life grows easier and the occasional burst of self-assertion rocks people back and keeps her from getting trod on.<br /><br />One of these moments occurs shortly after Eilis is assigned to the new counter for Negro hosiery at Bartocci's. Eilis is as racist as the next immigrant and has no particular feelings about blacks one way or the other. The black women who come into the store are well dressed, and ignore her totally, even during the transaction. \\"The few who did speak to her used tones of such elaborate politeness that they made her feel awkward and shy.\\" The \\"fierce tension\\" in the store leaves her exhausted.<br /><br />But when one of her fellow lodgers makes a snooty racist remark about steering clear of the place, Eilis bridles. \\"I'll tell Mr. Bartocci that. He'll be very upset Sheila. You and your friend here are famous for your style, especially for the ladders in your stockings and the fussy old cardigans you wear.\\"<br /><br />Shortly afterwards she meets a young man at a dance. He's Italian, which creates a little fuss at the lodging house, giving Eilis occasion for another sharp remark:<br /><br />\\"'I think we have to be very careful about men we don't know coming into the hall,' Sheila Heffernan said.<br /><br />\\"'Maybe if we got rid of some of the wallflowers, Sheila,' Eilis said, `with the sour look on their faces.'\\"<br /><br />Eilis' young man, Tony, is funny and good-natured. A plumber, he lives in a cramped apartment with his parents and brothers, where they plan a better future on Long Island, building houses.<br /><br />He's as open as Eilis is guarded and sweeps her off her feet as best he can, though she drags her heels a bit. In this new love affair she is feeling her way, cautious, while Tony knows what he wants. Eilis's way of \\"holding him at a distance\\" is to withhold information about herself or her feelings. But sometimes not speaking up is a form of encouragement as well. Is Eilis in love or is she enjoying the attention and the novelty? Even she isn't sure.<br /><br />Toibin's spare, incisive prose draws the reader into Eilis' soul until we see the world through her eyes. Her view of Brooklyn - a grimy, bustling, alien place - gradually becomes more ordinary, its crowds more colorful than frightening, its strangeness more alluring than intimidating.<br /><br />His prose quiet and measured, Toibin conveys the intensity of her experience in the vividness of moments, the pervasiveness of loneliness, the excitement of new experiences, whether it be putting change into the pale palm of a black hand or attending a ballgame at Ebbet's Field. Our level of comfort rises with Eilis,' until suddenly her old life intervenes and Eilis must make a choice, alarming the reader with her dangerous drifting and procrastination.<br /><br />Engaging and entirely absorbing, \\"Brooklyn\\" is an exquisite portrait of 1950s impoverished Old World Ireland and the raw, hard-knocks opportunities of Brooklyn bustle.

B00284BMBM|5.0|I listen over and over to this album. I never bored. The songs is flowing like river.     1. You Don't Belong To Me- 9/10   The harder of rock songs on the album.

0307269981|3.0|\\"The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo\\" was one of the most original thrillers I've read in years. I confess some disappointment in the sequel, even though I enjoyed it. Three major flaws:<br /><br />1. The plot keeps Lisbeth Salander (the protagonist) out of the limelight for the middle third of the book, and she's badly missed;<br />2. There is not nearly enough interaction between Blomqvist and Salander until the end, again due to plot machinations;<br />3. Simply too many characters, some of whom disappear from the book without any plot resolution.<br /><br />All in all, a good read but not up to the level of the first book.
B001E1DJD4|4.0|The piano-driven songs of spurned love were the best thing for me about Rachael Yamagata's debut Happenstance (2004). However, the rest of the album was uninspiringly poppy and represented (I felt) a dramatic undersell of Yamagata's talents. Some songs were also all too clearly influenced by Fiona Apple (influences themselves are not a problem, but if you're trying to carve out your own niché and audience, it's probably better not to wear them so clearly on your sleeve). Between her first and second albums passed four years in which Yamagata released a decent EP and contributed vocals to albums by Bright Eyes, Ryan Adams, Rhett Miller and Ray LaMontagne (the latter of whom also appears on this album).    The four-year hiatus seems to have served her songwriting very well since she returns on 'Elephants...Teeth Sinking into Heart' with a maturer sound, more emotionally consistent lyrics and a more confident vocal delivery. The standout songs of the first half of the album - most notably 'Horizon' and 'Over and Over', the first of which exceeds the eight-minute mark - are stunning reminders of what Yamagata can do if she puts her mind and heart to it. This time around she is much more interested in creating a sustained, emotionally intimate connection with the listener. Weary, brooding ballads of lost love and changed minds delivered sometimes in a near-whisper give you the feeling that you are right there in her front room, voyeuistically participating in the cathartic aftermath of love gone wrong.   Like Anna Ternheim on her most recent album, Yamagata repeats specific sentiments and sentences almost obsessively until every last fibre of emotion is spun out of them. For example on the refrain of 'Horizon': \\"Nothing is clear / No, no, no, nothing is clear to me!' might sound absurd written on the page but it is sung and wrung out to brilliant emotional effect on the album. When the lyrics unravel to tell of disillusionment with an ex - \\"I don't believe in you / LikeI so wanted to / I hope you're asking the heavens above / To forgive all the damage you've done / And if I did teach you anything at all / I hope that you learned how to love\\" - it's tempting to believe that they are addressed to her ex, the British singer-songwriter Tom McRae, who left her. Certainly, some of the lyrics do seem codedly to reference his: \\"You have blood on your hands.../ You poured blood in my heart\\" (Sunday Afternoon) recalls the title imagery of his album Just Like Blood; both have sung of having a meeting place down by the water and draw on rain imagery, associating it with redness (McRae on 'Sao Paulo Rain' - a song she used to cover live - and Yamagata on 'Sunday Afternoon') and lightning strikes on both Yamagata's 'Over and Over' and McRae's 'I ain't scared of lightning'. But Rachael has been more cryptic in interviews, saying: \\"I certainly love a great heart-wrenching lyric, but oftentimes I'm not even specifically referencing a relationship...for me, it's really all about the universal nature of just trying to relate to another person.\\"   Although I couldn't warm to the grungier, rockier songs on the shorter second half of the album (Teeth sinking into Heart) and the vocals provided by Ray LaMontagne on 'Duet' tend towards the cloyingly and annoyingly affected, the vivid tracks mentioned above make this album one to savour.  The standouts (IMO): Horizon, Over and Over, Sunday Afternoon, Don't  Also recommended>  * P J Harvey - Who Will Love Me Now (from the film [[ASIN:B0007V9WRY The Passion of Darkly Noon]]  * [[ASIN:B000CSUWPI Anna Ternheim, Somebody Outside (2006)]]  * [[ASIN:B000002HHB Natalie Merchant, Tigerlily (1995)]]
B000V86OKG|2.0|I have seen over half of this season thus far, and I can honestly say it holds nothing, not a grain of salt to the first season. I read that seasons 2 and 3 are not based on the books by Jeff Lindsay and have largely original story lines. It is horrifically apparent in the second season. Our Darkly Dreaming Dexter has fallen into the hands of terrible and uncharacteristic television writing. I lost all hope for the show as soon as he cheated on Rita. This absolutely destroyed the show for me. His calm cool precise ways of dealing with life(and death) that gave the first season such a thrilling feel of accomplishment and originality, has dissapeared and left this serial killing protagonist a unlikable antagonistic [...]. I am still watching the show with the hopes of it in some way redeeming itself by scrapping its \\"days of our lives\\" generic plot twists and continuing on the path of the books to keep this show from being cut up, stuffed in hefty bags, and tossed into the gulf stream and washed into the North Atlantic for good. With all my gripes it is still gripping and intriguing, and is still very above average, but our new character Lila, the English (con)artist (or as Deborah calls her, the pale tittie Vampire Girl)is the wrench that throws itself into this series story,and Dexter's life. It is a deconstructing insult to almost everything that was so incredible about the first season. I hope Dexter is a deep sea diver, cause he has some swimming to do to get this show back on track.
B000F0UV0E|5.0|Mark Knopfler is a favorite of mine.  Brothers in Arms is wonderful to hear no matter what the day or mood.  It was an easy decision to give a listen to this pairing of MK and Emmylou Harris.  It is a delight.  The lyrics paint scenes and stories vividly so I was glad they have been included with the CD.  These two make good music sharing fun-loving and thoughtful moments.  You know the time has come for the guy to move on from Donkey Town - how many guys have been there?  Love and Happiness is a gem.  If This is Goodbye is touching.    These people are poets.
B0018RWD5O|5.0|John Coltrane's Crescent is one of the most underrated jazz albums ever. It was recorded right before his masterpiece A Love Supreme so maybe thats the reason it tends to be forgotten. But despite all of that this album maybe be better than A Love Supreme. Coltrane's playing is phenomenal and very lyrical. It's a darker moody kind of album with mostly ballads except for the short 3 minute track called Bessie's Blues. My favorite tracks on the album are the title track and Wise One two beautiful ballads by Coltrane. If you are starting a Coltrane collection or Jazz collection be sure to buy this CD. This is probably my second favorite Coltrane album of all time, the first being Giant Steps and the third being A Love Supreme. I guarantee you will enjoy this album.

0547258305|4.0|Graceling (2008) by Kristin Cashore is, in many ways, the fantasy novel I have been hoping to stumble upon all summer.<br /><br />In the world of Graceling certain people are graced in their youth with a powerful ability. Some might call these Gracelings lucky, blessed even. But Katsa knows that her own devastating Grace of killing is more burden than blessing. Forced to do the bidding of her uncle, King of the Middluns, Katsa is dispatched to dole out tangible examples of the King's disfavor.<br /><br />Katsa lives her life apart from the rest of the court in her uncle's castle, avoided both because of her fearsome Grace and her startling eyes--one blue and one green--that mark her as a Graceling. Though far from content, Katsa has reconciled herself to this life.<br /><br />At least until she meets another Graceling, a prince called Po. Skilled in the art of combat, Po is the first worthy opponent Katsa has encountered. The prince might also be the first friend Katsa has made since her Grace first revealed itself.<br /><br />Together, the two embark on an adventure the likes of which neither can imagine in search of a truth almost too diabolical to believe.<br /><br />Katsa is a strong and complex character that readers are sure to adore and admire. She is also headstrong, almost to the point of absurdity. Her opinions on marriage and children are central to the plot and indeed to Katsa's identity. Still, by the end of Graceling I couldn't help but wonder, if two people love each other and know they want to be together, what is the harm in being married? Katsa says repeatedly that she won't compromise her freedom by marrying anyone which is a very difficult but admirable position to take. And yet. It seems to me that loving someone at all is a compromise whether you marry themor not.<br /><br />The plot itself is no less compelling. Though I was sorry to see so little of Giddon (I took an instant liking to him as a character), it was a joy to read about Katsa and Po's blossoming relationship and to see Katsa come to terms with her Grace and the responsibility that comes with it. Cashore's villain is stunningly diabolical and cunning--so much so that I have to admit the ending did feel anti-climactic.<br /><br />Graceling is everything a reader can hope for in a fantasy. Cashore's writing and her world building are utterly unique--the only disappointment is that I didn't think of it myself. The book is filled with action, fights, journeys, and even some romance. The setting, like the characters, are straightforward and evocative. Lienid particularly jumped off the page with Cashore's descriptions.Po's blossoming relationship and to see Katsa come to terms with her Grace and the responsibility that comes with it.

0385342020|5.0|Sophie Kinsella is best known for her Shopaholic series (and recent movie). But she has written 'stand alone' novels, that are just as captivating.<br /><br />Twenties Girl introduces us to Lara Lington. She's attending the funeral of her Great Aunt Sadie, who has passed away at the ripe old age of 105, with her family. None of the family really seems to have known or visited Sadie. When a voice shouts out in the middle of the funeral \\"Where's my necklace?\\", Lara is taken aback. it seems that no one else can hear the voice - or see the beautiful young woman, dressed in twenties flapper style, doing the shouting.<br /><br />Lara is stressed - she's still in love with her former boyfriend and is having work issues and money woes. Is she losing it or is she really seeing the ghost of her Aunt Sadie? Yes, she really is..... Lara reluctantly agrees to help Sadie find her lost necklace.<br /><br />Kinsella has created not one, but two characters that you immediately fall in love with. Lara is scattered, but warm hearted and the kind of person you'd love to have as a friend. Sadie is by turns exasperating, funny, loving and tragic. Their combined story is comic and heartwarming. The interaction between Sadie and Lara is priceless.<br /><br />I enjoyed this story very much. It combined the best of Kinsella's warm writing with a little bit more. My grandmother is 95 and I so enjoy hearing stories of her life. Twenties Girl will entertain you, but will hopefully make you think about an older person that you know who may have some amazing stories to tell.<br /><br />Destined to be another bestseller and a five star read for me - highly recommended
B00005JLZN|2.0|I didn't see this movie when it came out, largely because I knew it was a strident anti-death penalty movie (with this being said:  I did see and appreciate \\"Dead Man Walking\\" because that was well-made propaganda and made an effort to see both sides of the story).<br /><br />The only reason I watched it six years after the fact is because I've grown into a huge fan of Kate Winslet.  Sadly, while she's a great actress and does her best, \\"the Life of David Gale\\" sinks because of various flaws and premises.<br /><br />&lt;general criticisms><br /><br />The movie wears its politics on its sleeve to put it mildly.  Cracks like, \\"You can tell you're in the bible belt by the fact that there are more prisons than Starbucks\\" and referring to the Governor of Texas (a stand-in for George W. Bush) as a \\"frat boy\\" abound.<br /><br />&lt;the cast><br /><br />Kate Winslet continues to show that she can do a convincing American accent.  This being said, she came across as a bit too young and \\"soft\\" to be a tough, aggressive prize winning journalist.  Also, whoever gave her character the first name of \\"Bitsey\\" was an idiot. I can't imagine a journalist going by that name being taken seriously by anyone.<br /><br />Kevin Spacey has a commanding presence, and I found him very believable as a philosophy professor and fanatical ideologue who had his life fall apart because one mistake.<br /><br />Laura Linney did a good job playing Kevin Spacey's fellow activist.<br /><br />The ex-student who seduced David Gale and accused him of raping her was very sexy, but I thought she was a little too mature to be even a graduate student.<br /><br />The actor playing the Governor had an unenviable job of playing a caricature.  I can only contrast it with the way that \\"Dead Man Walking\\" depicted people who supported the death penalty.  Those characters came across as \\"real people\\"...not the product of fevered imagination of people on one side of the political debate.<br /><br />&lt;the plot><br /><br />I thought that it was a little too implausible that David Gale would be one moment falling down drunk at the party where he was falsely accused of rape, and the next moment making vigorous love to the hot ex-student.<br /><br />Another laughable flaw in the story line was how they telegraphed that Bitsey Bloom's car was going to break down at a critical moment.  The idea that she wouldn't have gotten one that was working properly was ludicrous.<br /><br />Watching this movie one would be left thinking that the only reason why we have the death penalty in the US is because evil politicians have forced it on us.  That's not right.  Instead, we have it because by a large majority, Americans support the death penalty and its constitutionality has been affirmed over and over again by the courts.<br /><br />&lt;the premise> &lt;spoilers><br /><br />The premise of the movie is that David Gale and his colleague (Laura Linney's character) could not come up with a good response to the challenge, \\"Name one innocent man put to death in Texas.\\"  So they decided to create such a case.  Laura Linney's character was dying of cancer, so she did not value her life.  David Gale was a driven, embittered fanatic who didn't value his so much either.<br /><br />So they made it look like David Gale brutally raped and murdered her and they allowed what one Supreme Court justice has called the \\"machinery of death\\" take over.  David Gale was duly convicted of rape and murder and sentenced to die.<br /><br />Enter Bitsey Bloom.  Gale and his friends chose her to break the story after Gale's execution.  This story was that Gale did not rape and murder his friend and that the State of Texas did wrongly execute an innocent man.<br /><br />Supposedly, this news story --which would be a blockbuster-- caused a 17 point drop in support for the death penalty.<br /><br />But in my humble opinion, the reaction of many Americans would be \\"What fanatics Gale and his friend were!\\"  It would not be \\"Wow, I never realized how wrong the death penalty was before.\\"<br /><br />Think about it.  Gale and his friend basically entered into an elaborate conspiracy to obstruct justice with the intent of framing someone...only their target was David Gale.  They are the ones who were responsible for Gale getting convicted, sentenced to death, and executed.  The system didn't \\"fail\\" because of the system's faults.  The system failed because of what they did.  It wouldn't have happened if it hadn't been for them.  Gale may not have been guilty of rape and murder, but he was guilty of committing suicide using death row as the weapon.<br /><br />Bottom Line:  \\"The Life of David Gale\\" has an interesting premise but in the end, it all amounts to the sort of cheap theatrics that the anti-death penalty crowd so frequently engage in...arguing that someone is completely innocent and blameless when the evidence ultimately proves him otherwise.ustice with the intent of framing someone...only their target was David Gale.

0446581348|5.0|I recently got into makeup, so I went to the bookstore to check out various books. I looked at Kevyn Aucoin, Carmindy, etc. etc. (they are good too), but the one book that really spoke to me was this one!    1) I really like the simple layout and its focus on the basics, as well as being good to your skin. Yeah, you might already know a lot of things, but I doubt many people out there TRULY know the best way to do basics--- and that's where this book comes in.     2) I'm also a fan of the really organized nature of the book; so if you're someone who enjoys learning in a organized manner, it's great!     3) I really really like how the book touches on different ethnicities (this is so helpful esp. for asians like me --- who are frustrated by all those books out there that do not touch on how to do asian eye makeup--- which, for those who don't know requires a whole different technique than those with \\"normal\\" eye shapes.) I even looked at the Asian faces book (a book supposedly devoted to Asian faces) and still decided I like BB's better.

B001QTXM5Y|5.0|When this movie originally was released in theatres, I decided to wait until the actual director's cut came out. Mainly because I wanted to get the fully idealized version of the film, and because I wanted to avoid all the Watchmen review civil wars that were going on at the time.<br /><br />Anyway so as for the movie itself, this is based on Alan Moore's groundbreaking comic book maxi-series from the 80s(everyone forgets it was a comic 1ST and a graphic novel 2ND!). Moore wanted nothing to do with it, because he's had a bear up his butt ever since the last couple of movie fiascos based on his works(Constantine, From Hell, League Of Extraordinary Gentlemen). But Zack Snyder came along and made this sucker work. For the longest time, the project was plagued with doubt because no one really had any faith that it could be made into a coherent story. The mature nature of The Dark Knight helped cement the idea that not all superhero movies need to be corny action flicks<br /><br />The story is set in an alternate history during 1985. Nixon is STILL President, and Congress has put a ban on superheroes. The Comedian, a former hero from a group called Watchmen, is mysteriosly murdered. Rorschach, the only active hero, sets out to find his killer. What follows is a look into the background of all these now-retired heroes. Nite-Owl is dreaming of his glory days, Silk Spectre tries to live a life away from her mother while comforting Dr. Manhattan(the only one with powers), and Ozymandias is creating a new type of energy source with his vast fortune. However, Rorschach gets framed for killing an ex-villain. Nite-Owl hooks up with Silk Spectre, and frees Rorschach, while Dr. Manhattan is cooling off on Mars because he is blamed for giving his former friends cancer. It turns out the entire thing was a plot by Ozymandias set to stop the nations of the world from going into nuclear war. A final confrontation between the remaning heroes results in them going along with Ozymandias' idea, despite all the deaths it caused, except for Rorscach who ends up as snow pizza.<br /><br />Despite all the fanboy gripe that this movie got, there was an equal amount of praise for it. Most people's expectations got a little to high though, thinking that a Rated-R superhero movie would stay in the #1 spot for very long, which is unfortunate because that's how ALOT of jerks are going to insist on looking at it years from now. I thought the film as a whole captured all the important aspects of the original story, at least alot better than some other comic-based movies. This new Director's Cut brings some additional footage that was left out of the theatrical edition which adds more clarity to the plot, plus some scenes that weren't included at all like the death of the original Nite-Owl. I'd recommend getting this, BIGTIME.l the deaths it caused, except for Rorscach who ends up as snow pizza.

B00008MJ8H|5.0|Wonderful, a lovely piece of music, a must have in any music collection, classic or otherwise. Vey good value for money.
B00005KARJ|5.0|There is nothing wrong with this film!!! I LOOOVE IT!!! I remember watching it when I was 5 years old and to this day I absolutely LOVE it!! I don't know what those people are talking about with one star rating because of all the racial bullcrap ... children don't catch on to that. good grief! And the cruelty to animals and the big ears... the only thing that mattered here & that stands out in any child's mind is a) how degrading we are to those who are less fortunate, which teaches children to be more loving and understanding; and also opens their eyes to how fortunate and blessed many are, b) to keep on going and never give up & to believe in yourself... and that things do not always come out the way one intends, but nonetheless it is crucial to make something of it, and c) the relationship that Dumbo has with his beautiful mother elephant is UNBEATABLE in the eyes of any child!!! how can anyone say this is a bad and discriminating film!!!! The bigger picture is so much more!! I LOVE DUMBO (^.^); it's a great film and does not linger & linger. HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!!!

0891419195|5.0|Sledge's account of his time as a young soldier fighting in the Pacific is heartbreaking and harrowing. It is one of the better memoirs to come out of the Second World War. I recommend this along with William Manchester's \\"Goodbye Darkness.\\"
B0024RIMBG|5.0|An hour and a half of absolute pleasure with six beautiful and talented Irish girls, including the impish Mairead who can fiddle your heart out. The result is an entertaining show enhanced by the by the Aontas Choral ensemble and the Irish Film Orchestra.  When I was in Dublin, my Irish friends told me that most of the Irish people could sing (although the Welsh say that they are the best), well this DVD certainly proves it. I definitely recommend it to all real music lovers who like to hear angelic voices sing the likes of The Prayer, The Voice, You Raise Me Up and the sublime Panis Angelicus. These renditions are complimented by such lively pieces as Granuiale's Dance, Sing Out and Spanish Lady.     Just switch your DVD Player on and relax with Chloe, Orla, Lisa, Meav, Hayley and of course Mairead; in short Celtic Woman.
235250080X|5.0|A great reference guide to items used by the US Army in the European Theater during the Second World War. The photographs are very nicely done, and the information on the weapons, uniform items, and other objects that accompany the photos are also informative and interesting. A great research tool for reenactors, researchers, historians, and anyone interested in military history, especially World War II. The price is still fairly high for these books, but it is justified by the items contained within as well as the excellent photos. I only wish each branch and each belligerent involved in the war could have such a nice book.
B001SN78JO|4.0|Jim Carey is funny in this movie, but not as crazy as his usual fare.  He keeps the movie real and skips the far-out mugging he usually likes to cram into every scene.  This was more of a relaxing funny movie to enjoy that involves a quirky sweet romance.<br /><br />Jim plays the lead as Carl Allen a negative man, stays at home,  newly divorced, shuns friends, and has no initiative and a bad attitude at work.  He wants to contain his life, and not take on any new projects.<br /><br />He runs into an old friend one night who brings him to a seminar on saying \\"Yes\\" to life.  The positivity \\"Yes\\" leader asks who are new attendees and picks Carl out of the audience.  He walks over to where Carl is sitting as Carl said \\"No\\" he would not come up on the stage.  One-on-One, in front of thousands the Yes Guru talks to Carl and makes a covenant for him to say Yes, that good things will happen.  Bad things will happen when he says no.<br /><br />At first Carl grudgingly embraces saying Yes - but soon realizes good things happen when he helps people.  Carl becomes a man who says Yes - and cannot say no.<br /><br />He meets a quirky young woman (Zooey Deschanel) on a motorcycle who happens to sing rock music, and take photos while jogging at the break of dawn, he learns guitars, learns a new language, learns to play the guitar, helps an elderly neighbor lady,<br /><br />I was pleasantly surprised how Cary played the lead.  He was not overacting and was realistic in the character he played.  His free-spirited girlfriend (Zooey)  was just right for the part.<br /><br />His boss Norm is played by Rhys Derby and Bradley Cooper plays Carl's supportive best buddy.
B001IHJ97E|4.0|This is my favorite Louise Fletcher movie (she should have at least received an oscar nomination for this).  The first DVD transfer of Brainstorm was quite disappointing, but this one is much, much better, especially on a 16 by 9 TV.  There is a litte distortion in the soundtrack in several places, but this is far better than the original DVD.  I do wish they would have filled the screen on the 1:85 sequences (instead of window-boxing them), which they did do on the last (4:3) laserdisc release of this movie. I also wish they would have including some extras on this version, but I still highly recommend it!    And this is yet one more title that NEEDS TO BE ON BLURAY!
B001M5UDGS|5.0|Dr. Horrible.<br />A simple web-based film or something more?<br />A musical myth deeply rooted in our modern society with subtle undertones or just a bunch of geeks singing? In any case, Dr. Horrible is to awesome as outer space is to BIG.<br /><br />I watched this online about a month after the last part was released and hoped from that day there would be a DVD.<br /><br />The Commentary tracks are delicious.  As is the SING ALONG Commentary!  Some of the funniest things I've ever heard as well as the darker side of getting everything you ever wanted.  This film goes from Slapstick to Noir in a little over forty minutes.<br /><br />Highly recommended for its own merits as well as for fans of Joss Whedon and Firefly, Buffy, Angel, Doogie Houser M.D. and just about anything else that has the balls to be emotional and realistically gritty in a fantasy world.<br /><br />Warning: not intended for those without a sense of humor or those expecting big explody things with no brainpower investment required.
0345495004|4.0|I finished Loving Frank late last night and well into this morning, I'm still pondering the book; 320 pages of an evenly paced reading U-turns at the remaining 30 pages with a plot twist I did not see coming and left me finishing the book with my chin on the floor and tears in my eyes.<br />The story is based on the 7 year love affair between Frank Lloyd Wright and one of his married clients, Mamah Borthwick.  Apparently there is very little historical documentation about Mamah's life, and certainly less about the love affair.  To this end, Nancy Horan has done an amazing job of writing an exhaustive love story.  One also gets a nice insight to the historical setting; early 20th century America/Europe in the throws of cultural transition, the women's suffrage movement, and the advent of Wright's groundbreaking \\"organic\\" architecture.  At face value this makes for a well paced, historical fiction novel.  Although I truthfully didn't like any of the characters in the book, least of all Wright, I could appreciate their torment in carrying on what at the time was a scandal of the highest order and I very much the story taken as a whole.<br />However, the ending was just so shocking that I can honestly say I've finished this book completely dumbfounded.  I cannot summarize Loving Frank in one word, but I will encourage others to read it.<br />Rating: 4 our of 5 Stars<br />Suggested With: Iced tea and a quiet summer afternoon.
B001NYTWVA|5.0|I love this cd. Damian Marley may not have the same style as his father, but that is good. He displays his own unique talent and style throughout this cd. I have this in heavy rotation. He spits a lot of truth on this cd and he also gives you some light hearted songs too. I would mos def recommend buying this cd.
B001QOOCTE|5.0|I am a collector of music, I have thousands CDs and DVDs from all over the world and of all genre.  This is a wonderful. wonderful CD/DVD set.  I was moved to tears watching the DVD of these artists.  Please do yourself a great favor, buy this set and believe.
B002BX4VEK|5.0|Do you think Michael Jackson is anything like the King of Pop? He's so not. But you have every reason to believe he's the demigod of popular music --- Elvis Presley, the real king, turned his career into such a Vegas joke that it's hard to recall the great music he made.<br /><br />I don't mean the early hits, though they are an explosive blend of country and gospel --- the pop music equivalent of the atomic bomb.<br /><br />I mean the best record he ever made: From Elvis in Memphis, recorded in two months in 1969 and now re-released as a package of 36 songs for the ridiculous price of $12.99.<br /><br />To understand why \\"From Elvis in Memphis\\" is so great, we must first acknowledge the buffoon Elvis had become. The movies he made in the `60s were total junk, and so was the music that filled those soundtrack records. The Beatles and Rolling Stones and a hundred other groups had the spotlight, and the killer music they were making stole the young audience. Elvis was left with blue-haired ladies, Southern men and some splinter demographics.<br /><br />Worst of all, his manager didn't give a damn --- \\"Colonel\\" Tom Parker was a sharpie who would collect advances for his memoirs from several publishers. He would famously say, after Presley's death, \\"I own half of Elvis alive, and I own half of him dead.\\"<br /><br />But it came to pass, in 1968, that Elvis took stock of himself. Although he hated personal confrontation, he did something the Colonel wouldn't approve or understand --- he gave a torrid performance in Vegas that made for a great TV show.<br /><br />And then he went to Memphis to make a record.<br /><br />Elvis is the hero of this piece, but \\"Chips\\" Moman is a close second. Moman founded and built the Memphis studio where Stax artists like Otis Redding and Sam & Dave recorded. He pretty much invented the horn-heavy \\"Memphis sound.\\" He co-authored \\"Do Right Woman, Do Right Man\\", recorded by Aretha Franklin, and played guitar on her classic \\"I Never Loved a Man.\\" In the late `60s, he was creatively on fire. As he's said: \\"When we would get through with something, we'd say, `Let's call home sick.' Nobody wanted to leave the studio.\\"<br /><br />Chips Moman produced the Elvis sessions. Recording was the easy part. But Elvis's entourage was used to him walking in, listening to already-completed instrumental tracks, doing a few takes and leaving. They were puzzled --- and not in a good way --- by a guy exhorting Elvis to do better.<br /><br />Moman was a little smarter than Elvis' entourage: \\"Whenever I got ready to talk to him about how he was singing a song, I would turn all the monitors off and I would walk out into the room and go into the booth with him personally and just stand there and talk with him. And it was no problem.\\"<br /><br />Quickly, the sessions became a delight. Moman placed Elvis in the center of the studio, surrounded by musicians. Recording together was like giving a concert --- Elvis was energized. And, in song after song, he gave performances that defined him.<br /><br />Some were from the Vegas show, some were old country hits, some were cover versions. The record was a total winner. For the first time in years, Elvis ruled the charts. His fans loved the classic stuff --- this was sneering, gyrating, totally involved Elvis. And in songs like \\"In the Ghetto\\", Elvis reached out to people who were not inclined to take him seriously. Get lost, Mick Jagger --- the King is back!<br /><br />Correction: The King was back. But not for long. Colonel Tom reasserted himself, and, in the summer of 1969, Elvis returned to Vegas with a lazy, uncreative act. Drugs followed, then torpor, then death.<br /><br />Maybe it's too simple to say that he'd had a brief revival in those few months of freedom in a studio in a Memphis ghetto. But for two shining months in a ghetto studio in Memphis, Elvis Presley recovered the source of his greatness. And with this recording, the King reclaimed his crown..

B0009HLD0K|5.0|The movie portrays a group of local Indiana childhood friends who seem content on staying together forever in their youth; no ambition, no goals until they are pitted against the priveleged \\"rich\\" college students attending IU. This is perhaps one of the best feel good sports movies ever made. It ranks up there with Hoosiers. It does have a borrowed interest from Rocky to an extent but it works. And you will probably guess how the movie ends but it still works because the real ending is not the race. Oh did I mention it is about cycling? This movie predates Lance Armstrong by a few decades. Who knows, perhaps it inspired him?     This is a movie that I watched with the entire family because we could. The entire family loved it. I give it 5 stars for this genre.
B00000K0DQ|4.0|I received this very quickly.  However, it does seem that the soundtrack is somewhat of poor quality.  It is audible and works fine enough to watch, but it did not seem to be up to par with most other DVD's.  Possibly it is just that the movie is older.
B00004NRWH|4.0|I, as I imagine many people, thought that Nickelback's first album was Silver Side Up. Finding out that they had 2 albums before it (this one, The State, and another titled Curb) was an amazing discovery. I didn't really know what to expect but I was pleasently surprised listening to this the first time. Though, if you listen to all of the bands work its easy to see how they have evolved over the years, this album is an interesting look at their earlier years and it includes a lot of great tracks.
B0013FNC38|5.0|This whole cd is great.  I bought it for \\"Lucky\\" with Colbie Callait, but after listening to the whole thing, found that it was full of great songs... love his upbeat style. I would highly recommend this cd.  Great price and quick shipping also!
0446579939|4.0|I enjoyed Nicolas Sparks' The Lucky One.  It is a light, romantic read, that's great for nightly reading before falling asleep. The main characters didn't stay with me and follow me throughout the day, as some characters do, although I liked them well enough while I was reading about them. I'm sure most readers will find the story a pleasurable read. A friend of mine just loved it. It's the story of an ex-marine who walked from Colorado to North Carolina with his dog in search of a woman whose picture he carried throughout his stint in Iraq and who he feels, despite what common sense tells him, that the photo kept him safe while engaging in battle with the enemy. Why he walked, rather than buy a car and drive, I understood was to free his mind of the horrors of the war and the later pain of losing a good friend. An interesting concept and perhaps a very viable one.    Eunice Boeve, author of Ride a Shadowed Trail

B00005JNQA|4.0|The Interpreter is an excellent film.  It is serious and thoughtful- not the overblown nonsense that I think the advertisements and whatnot made it out to be. It's a political thriller that is realistic, at least in the way it treats the characters and their motivations. Perhaps some might argue that the individual &#34;suspense&#34; elements of plot are not very realistic, but the fine acting, script, and serious presentation give those elements more credibility than they might have if just considered on their own merits.<br /><br />The film is measured, without a lot of dramatic music and flashy editing. It also treats the fictional political conflict, which could easily stand in for any number of real-world situations such as Zimbabwe, Sri Lanka, or the Congo, very seriously and does a good job connecting human emotions with a type of conflict that most of us probably don't relate to very well here in the US.<br /><br />The best thing about the movie is the acting by Nicole Kidman and Sean Penn. They are both utter professionals who clearly embraced their roles. Ms. Kidman is icy and enigmatic, but somehow still allows the viewer to feel her barely submerged pain and suffering. Mr. Penn is completely convincing as a consummate professional torn up by some inner demons.<br /><br />Perhaps some viewers may not find this movie particularly &#34;entertaining.&#34; It lacks the sensationalism and flash that audiences might expect. It also features some pretty miserable characters-- I don't think there's a single laugh in the whole film. The politics it deals with is the type most Americans would rather pretend don't exist- the continued suffering and strife of impoverished post-colonial African nations. It is however, a masterfully acted, technically accomplished, and thought-provoking movie, and a really tense thriller, as well.is however, a masterfully acted, technically accomplished, and thought-provoking movie, and a really tense thriller, as well.
B0000DJE9R|5.0|Loved the CD.  Michael Jackson keeps impressing after all these years. Even the songs that were not so popular are incredibly amazing.
B000HA4WT8|5.0|Unlike the last 3 paul walker film this one focused more on what was important and that was racing. The others always had to be about undercover cops and criminals and how to stop a ruthless bad guy (part 2 and 4 face it 4 was a recycled story). This movie if anything is stand alone and took ideas of another film called initial D which was also good and freed its self of becoming generic. The acting here yeah it was average but it was not horrible like some claim (Mainly walker and Vin loyal fanatics)and the story was better cause it dumped the already old undercover underground drug trafficking story. If they go ahead with a 5th my advise is go back to tokyo and start with the characters of 4 meeting up with tokyo drift crew and make it into a racing rivalry and not undercover cop work.
1573300403|5.0|I just loved this DVD from head to toe.  All videos are amazing and created with exceptional mastery.  My favorites are \\"Liberian Girl\\" and MJ´s performance at the MTV awards. Liberian Girl features a lot of actors like John Travolta, Olivia Newton-John among others.  MJ doesn´t appear in the whole video until the end.  It is like everybody is waiting for him to shoot the video and it turns out that MJ is directing it.    MJ´s MTV performance is incredible. During his performance, Slash, the guitarist plays his guitar in a solo performance while MJ is dancing/singing.  After MJ is done with the singing, Slash keeps playing (I don´t think this was part of the show). MJ asks him to stop and he doesn´t.  MJ starts singing again while Slash keeps playing his solo... they had to unplug his guitar sound.  After the show MJ thanked Slash.  I guess you couldn´t do anything out of the lines and MJ didn´t really like it.  But, his performance is amazing.  This is a must have DVD!! By the way Lisa Marie is in the audience.

I suffer from this and I cant watch stuff like Blair Witch Project and Battlestar Galactica new TV series. I agree with every single positive point about this movie and I want to see the sequel, but im gonna sit in the last row and take some scopalmine. or wait till it comes out on DVD so I can pause it    It really bugs me that nobody in the film industry cares that they make some people physically ill with \\"shaky cam\\" jerky camera motion. There is a small percentage of population has RMS..  [...]    I am a huge fan of this movie and movies in general and i hope the people who made this great movie read this and dont use shaky cam in the next one so much, thanks
B002B55XGI|5.0|\\"Lone Survivor\\" should be required reading for all young men. It is an interesting expose on the training of the U.S. Navy Seal and skillfully presented from someone who has survived this training. The second half of the book is an incredible account of the putting into practice this intense training. It culminates in a wild, authentic revelation of the Afghanistan theater operation. I highly recommend this inspirational book to young and old.
B000002L99|5.0|This is the most complete album im my opinion. Iluv DLR but this album is brilliant , sure it went downhill from this point onwards , with there worst album ou812 .     GOOD ENOUGH  i dont know a better way to start an album  HALLOOOOO BBABBYYYYYY! brilliant , Eddie is great on this , its very much eddie tryin to do PANAMA(but not as good) part 2 , even the break down is half decent for hagar.    WHY CANT THIS BE LOVE , a trully great song absolutely brilliant , u still hear it on the radio these days , great keyboards , this is sammy at his best , EVH solo rocks , what a sound , not overly complicated but great none the less.    GET UP , similer to eddies previous solo but goes through the wholo song , almost thrash metal , a great song to get u rockin.    DREAMS another brilliant song , this is almost the perfect song , keyboards r brilliant , this combine all VH great attributes.    SUMMER NIGHTS starts off with eddie  a bit off riffing  but classic it as , then the song starts rocking ,  a great summer party song , n a forgotten classic, MA shines on this one  .    BEST OF BOTH WORLDS , actually pretty deep 4 a SH song , with great lyrics, EVHs riffing under the solo is simply fantastic .     LOVE WALKS IN  , is a great soft song , its not a ballad even though its title would suggest otherwise , great simple intro , it cld be one of the best written VH songs ever , its also a reason why DLR/VH fans dislike it so much , trust me there was worse to come ie WHEN ITS LOVE, CANT STOP LOVIN YOU, NOT ENOUGH , all are sappy love song which dont compare to this.    5150 is a great song ruined by SAMMY HAGAR , the music is brilliant , SAMMY ruins this one big time. Dave wld of made this a hit .    INSIDE , is interesting , its not really a song as such , sammy doest really sing its more of talking with a chorus , but i do enjoy it , he wld ruin many other songs to come ie BLACK N BLUE(ONE OF THEIR WORST) SPANKED , DLR  wld have made them great.    SO THERE YOU GO 5150 , ANY MUSIC FAN FULL STOP SHOULD HAVE THIS IN THERE COLLECTION.     VH wld never reach this peak again, it went downhill very quick , F.U.CK is a very good album but the rest of van hagar is avg at best , it never reached the greatness of DLR/VH , there wasnt a bad album or song in the first 6 albums.    People who shunned DLR  wld miss out on some great albums EAT EM N SMILE BEING up there with the best of van halen , skyscraper great , ALAE n yr YFLM  good , Dave hit form again with  the DLR band with john 5 on it , brilliant cd

B000B5OD4I|5.0|Ordered the watch on a Wednesday, it showed up Friday (with free shipping!).  Came from K.G. Company.  Showed up new, in the box, on a little pillow and everything. I got it super fast because of my proximity to the seller (I'm in San Diego, they're in LA).  I went back and forth for weeks on what watch to buy.  Due to the reviews, specifically the one where the guy was in the market for an Omega Seamaster and bought this watch instead.  I too am in the market for an Omega Seamaster (model 2200.50), but like that guy, I'm an expecting father also and couldn't justify spending $2500 on a watch right now.      So far, LOVE the watch.  Yes, the band, when not wearing it, seems a little \\"weak\\" and flimsy, but when you're wearing it, it's nice and flexible and moves with you and feels substantial enough.  Has nice adjustments (taking out the links and adjustments on the clasp also), so making it fit well, is a breeze.  The face is simple, easy to read and the luminous markers are pretty bright (especially compared to my other 2 Citizen watches).  Love the date and day feature.  Good sized watch, not too much is polished, so it's not too dressy and not too casual either. I think it's a perfect blend of both.  I am a little concerned about the polished parts (in the middle of the band, sides of the case and the sides of the band) getting scratched, but we'll see.  It's still new for me and I haven't bumped it too much...yet.  One of my Citizen watches has a good amount of polished parts on the band and around the case; after a few years of wearing it, it got pretty scuffed up and got it polished out, but it cost me a small fortune to get it polished. Should've saved my money and bought a new watch instead, so now I don't wear that watch much anymore because of that.   One of the last things that pushed me to pull the trigger, was that my dad wore a Seiko for YEARS.  So I was comfortable knowing that this watch should last a long time.
B001QWBM62|5.0|[[VIDEOID:38820171]]I bought this for recording interviews and nature sounds.  Works perfect on both accounts.  I definitely recommend one of those furry windscreens to cover the wind noise (a quick search on eBay shows some different makers  (it does come with a standard foam screen)    These are more worries and nit picks than complaints:    1) 25 second boot-up  2) The case printing in the menu/select area is rubbing off after only 2 weeks  3) The jog wheel/select button worries me a lot in a long range time frame as far as breaking  4) You're going to want the remote control to cut down on case noise if you're using a tripod(a little shopping around will get you a bundle deal)  5) The Cubase 4LE is certainly intense, but comes with a pretty obnoxious DRM license scheme (I know that it is free.)  For all the complaining about the H4N manual, wait until you wade through the Cubase (non-printed) manual.  6) You can set the H4N for use with NiMH rechargeable batteries; this means the battery level indicator is calibrated properly, it does NOT mean you can recharge the batteries while in the unit (I verified this with zoom/samsontech)    having said that, it's so cool that it has a ton of features most people will never use (4 channels, music effects, metronome, multi-track).  I've used it with a cheap 16GB transcend SD card with no problem.  It actually came with a printed manual!(when was the last time that happened?)It has a case and a AC adapter!  For only $350!! (I feel like Billy Mays Here)
B0015KGWZG|5.0|This book is great.  I read it the first time and it helped me a lot.  Of course, then I went back to my usual ways, worrying too much, so I'm reading it again.    It starts talking about death.  Yes, that thing that has been with us since we were born and will never go away and will one day tell us it's time.  So why worry so much about it?  We can be afraid or use the constant reminder to make sure we live today.    Then the book goes on about how we can learn to do just that.  Live today.  Forget about that past, because history cannot be changed today so never mind what happened.  And don't stop living today and postpone it for the future, because if that is your way, you will never live since the future will be the present when it comes, and it will have a future to worry about.    We are the masters of our thoughts, if only we try and learn how to do it.  And once you control your thoughts, you control your feelings.    Easier said than done, but this books helps a lot.  At least to me, I recommend it to everybody.
0439023491|5.0|There's not a thing I can complain about with this book. Collins has completely hit it out of the park. If there are any doubts in your mind about this book, especially after reading the first one, erase them. Not only does she build on the promise of THG, but she adds to it and further explores the possibilities of her new world.<br /><br />The characters are true to themselves and to each other. It's brilliant beyond all comparison. I don't want to spoil anything for anyone, sufficed to say that this is a winner of a sequel and fully worthy of being a Hunger Games book. It doesn't deviate in the slightest.<br /><br />Get it. Read it. Love it.

1584282584|5.0|This book clearly explains the logical approach and techniques required to take journalistic style photographs of people in action.  The goal of the new wave of event and portrait photographers is to seamlessly blend the ambient light of a scene with supplemental light supplied in most cases with an on or off camera flash.      Neil has a gift for explaining his techniques in a clear, consise manner.  He provides invaluable methods for adding just the kiss of light that makes a scene better in an unobtrusive way.    As a professional photographer with a studio Manhattan with over 28 years of experience, I recommend this book highly.
0525421033|5.0|This is absolutely a beautifully written book and an unforgettable  story with unforgettable characters. I read it too fast, I wanted to know what happens so I need to go back and read it again, slowly and just enjoy the characters, their life, and their family.  I know it is labeled young adult, but I think everyone would enjoy reading it, if that is a word I can use. I shed quite a few tears along the way. Just a beautiful book. I don't know what else to say.

B001GCUNWQ|5.0|I have to disagree with reviewers who try to \\"see\\" too many things in a movie made mainly for (young) kids. This movie made my child and me laugh many,many times. In fact I think it is even funnier than Ice Age 1+2. It is just \\"clean\\" family fun. In this age of over-hyped animation from Walt Disney and Pixar, how refreshing to watch something without too many pretensions and not too much relation to today's world. Let the kids be kids,please.
0307454541|3.0|Over all I enjoyed the book more than I expected (but that's probably because I am not a fan of this genre). The book is a bit too long and with too many details that are so minor that it makes you wonder if they are necessary. Things like having sandwich or what kind of shirt is worn just dont spell \\"important\\" to me.<br /><br />The first 70 pages or so are dedicated to character introduction. Seriously, there are just wayyyyyy too many people that I had to constantly go back to the family tree page (located at the beginning of the book). I dont understand since this is a made up fiction, why on earth did the author use the same name for two people? C'mon, at least make it Sr. and Jr.<br /><br />After the introduction of the characters, the book goes on and on about his life trying to find new information to solve the murder. It really is going on and on. He goes to the cafe, he takes a walk, he makes coffee and he reads...stuff like this. The book eventually picks up and becomes more of a page-turner when he FINALLY, after all the coffee he has consumed, finds new evidence!!! The pace then starts to pick up and goes by faster.<br /><br />What I like about the book is how it refers to/uses the bible to create a crime. I am not Christian or Catholic or anything of that norm and I dont read bible but that's why it is fascinating to me that way the author adopts the things from the Bible and makes something out of it.<br /><br />What I really disliked about the book is the raping and all that kind of stuff. As a female reader, it really is hard to continue the pages of men raping women, forcing unwanted sexual act and the things the main character Harriet goes through is just difficult to bear. I know it is fictional but it's too intense at times.<br /><br />I would also agree with the other readers' comments on the foreign language adoption. I am not quite sure why Herr and Frogen(sp?) are kept in the book, instead of using Mr. or Ms....I got confused at some point because I don understand German or Swedish and I thought they were new characters. I also got lost when all the Swedish city names are used in the book; I simply could not follow the places they are going to and I wound up telling myself that \\"they are now going SOMEWHERE ELSE\\".<br /><br />The ending is quite predictable. I am not sure how much I enjoy Salander's trip to steal money in London because it seems redundant to me.<br /><br />If you made it thru the end of this book, there is a partial prologue of the next book (the girl who played with fire) and it gives you a little sneak peak of Salander(the dragon tattooed girl)'s childhood. After reading 3 pages, I am not sure if I want to read the sequel. It is really disturbing; once again about minor sexual abuse. Yeah, I got it, sexual abuse is everywhere, but jamming it from one book to another just does not seem right.h and I thought they were new characters.

B0025X4P24|5.0|I listened to this CD several times before I turned to Amazon.com to see what the reviews had to say about Vanessa's latest singing venture and was pleasantly surprised to see that the vast majority of the listeners felt as I did.  This is a splendid album combing both jazz and salsa with a lot of romance mixed in. It is not a \\"pop\\" album like the latest Lionel Ritchie offering, which was terribly disappointing since he is such a fine singer.  However, Vanessa does not disappoint in this CD.  I have purchased and listened to everyone of her albums and she just gets better with age.  Vanessa's vocal range continues to improve and her selection of songs are just outstanding.  This is the type of music you want to listen to on a lazy afternoon as one of the songs suggests.  It is music that truly sooths the savage soul within us.  While there is no doubt she is one of the most beautiful women in the universe, a great actress, and an outstanding dancer, she completes her being with wonderful singing.  She truly is one of our treasures and this album only confirms these observations.  Don't wait any longer - go buy it and treat yourself - I promise that you won't be sorry you did.
B001PPGAIA|5.0|I'm not sure why this movie tanked at the box office.  Admittedly, the first 45 minutes or so are just plain silly (it seems as if it's going to be a very bad comedy) but it gets MUCH better after that.  Great acting, good story (villain, child in danger, love story -- it's got it all)!  Nicole Kidman looks as if she's about to drop from malnutrition (just eat already!) but Hugh Jackman (my favorite actor) does a great acting job AND is major eye candy!  There are tons of handsome actors, but how many of them can really act?  Hugh proves that he's not just a pretty face, but a darn good actor as well.  Rent it and enjoy!
B001V7R09A|5.0|I do not know what more a fan of classical piano music could want!  If you are just beginning to discover classical piano players, Richter ranks up there with the best of all time.  Many would say he was above all the others.  Technique, strength, passion--it is all here.  This box-set has a great variety of composers, the price is great, and the sound quality DG creates is excellent.  How someone could not give this 5 stars is truly beyond me!

B000006TRV|5.0|Pink Floyd is one of those groups that ... actually no more words need to be said.  Nearly every song they've ever done has proved classic.  Due to their great albums such as Meddle, Animals, Dark Side of the Moon, Wish You Were Here, Momentary Lapse of Reason, and The Division Bell, it's my stance that Pink Floyd will go down in history as possibly the best rock group that humanity ever formed.  And in my opinion their best album is The Wall.  It's the ultimate musical expression concerning the \\"New\\" World madness of the 20th and 21st centuries, particularly the madness which one feels in a world where it's seemingly only oneself seeing out through a pair of Hoffman lens.  Are you wearing them too?  Men are acting like compliant service and rank, shift and file dumbed down warswine NKVD, and women are even a touch shadier, activating some kind of bulimic phony insecure actress archetype, listening to music suggestive of Minnie Mouse on speed - thing, into oblivion.  Plus in case some of you haven't noticed you've been Wallmarted for real, but I guess we'll just chalk it all up to a few more very real bricks in the psychotically-nonexistant wall, i.e. that which actually does seperate and perpetually exists for as long as no one speaks on it.  Perturbed?  It's enough to make one mad I tell ya, and I believe that Roger Waters best expressed that sentiment musically.  So without any further ado, ladies and gentlemen I present to you, The Wall.

Never failing to move souls, this is the ultimate musical expression.

0790729644|1.0|I cannot believe that this won any academy awards, I just don't get it. Same thing with Clint Eastwood's Mystic River, I am not sure if that won any awards but I know it was highly praised, they are two different types of movies but what they both have in common is that they are both boring and pointless, I just don't get it. I do really enjoy some of Clint Eastwood's movies, Million Dollar Baby was great as well as Gran Torino. I guess I am just not a western movie fan although I loved The Good The Bad and The Ugly and Butch Cassidy and The Sundance Kid was fantastic.

031606792X|4.0|Don't let the some bad reviews of Breaking Dawn, stop you from reading this book. It was a very good book.

During the honeymoon, Bella becomes pregant. Which becomes a problem for everyone involved. Bella wants to keep the baby. While Edward thinks the pregancy should aborted.

0441003257|5.0|Where is the Adam, the Son of Satan?  He was misplaced by Sister Mary Loquacious of the Chatterly Order of Beryl - a satanic nunnery/hospital at birth.  He is now 12 years old and Armageddon will be upon us on Saturday.  Unless, Crowley (a demon from down there) and his unlikely friend Aziraphale (an angel from up there) are able to intercede and stop the destruction.  You see, Crowley and Aziraphale have been on Earth for so many years, they have grown to actually like the human race and are not looking forward to the boredom that will befall them if it is destroyed.  The angel and demon are not alone in their quest for the Spawn of Satan .  The Four Horsemen - Death, War, Famine and Pollution (filling in for Pestilence) - two Witchfinders and a Practical Occultist (using her ancestor's prophecy filled book The Nice and Accurate Prophecies of Agnes Nutter) are also searching for the misplaced Destroyer of Kings.<br /><br />These are just some of the unbelievable characters in Good Omensby Neil Gaiman and Terry Pratchett.  I have never read anything by either author and now I  have to wonder why.  I take that back, I did read Coraline (by Mr. Gaiman) with my daughter a few years back and was delighted by the experience.  So why, oh why, did I wait so long to immerse myself into another thrill ride?!?  My time spent with this book was pure fun, full of chuckles and entirely too short.  The footnotes alone are worth picking up this book.  In reference to Aziraphale thinking to himself that \\"the road to Hell is paved with good intentions.\\" the footnote explains: \\"This is not actually true.  The road to Hell is paved with frozen door-to-door salesmen.  On weekends many of the younger demons go ice-skating down it.\\"  Brilliant!!!
0307454541|1.0|The story is long and boring, with disturbing events and personas that leave a lack of empathy or emotion with the characters. A waste of money is what pretty much sums up my opinion of this book. I donated it and didn't even bother to lend it to friends.
1567184855|3.0|Perhaps my first lesson learned as prompted by the reading of this book, was simply to teach myself not to be so \\"attached\\" to my own concepts and mental constructs.  To wit: It has been my understanding that all the souls that were/are ever to exist, do (i.e. the souls of all are eternal and in similar fashion as the Creator, have always existed.)  Second the \\"ego mind\\" as discussed in Journey of Souls, appears to be something that is doled out in the after life/before life realm before physical manifestation; it is something given to us prior to personal incarnation.  From my perspective, \\"the beam in our own eye\\" as propounded by Jesus - is our ego.  The ego is the blockade that stands between our selves and God, which according to several masters which I trust implicitly and explicitly; is a prison or creation of our own devise.  I don't quite follow why God would give us something that ostensibly serves to separate us from Him, in order for us to struggle to overcome that which was given to us, so that we can then reunite with Him.  We certainly have a choice as to weather we want to wallow in ego/sensual pleasures or attune ourselves with God, but I don't see the former as being mandated by God, it clearly flies in the face of free will.<br /><br />If one were to read the accounts of NDE'ers, (and I've read thousands) a common thread that runs through the vast majority of them is the experiencer's sense of liberation and joining or at-one-ment with God or All That Is and their subsequent state of bliss, by contrast, Dr. Newton's subjects barely mention God or the immediate and profound knowledge or experience of that Oneness.  Strange.<br /><br />The book was well written and edited, with some interesting opines from the author, yet the content has left me with a certain nagging queasiness that suggests that this book may be more fanciful than factual.  It may be an inherent prejudice of mine, but that happens when conversations or facts are promulgated via hypnosis! Three stars on the board with a real 2 and ½ from me today.ars on the board with a real 2 and ½ from me today.
0307269981|3.0|When compared to The Girl with a Dragon Tattoo, The Girl Who Played With Fire is a disappointing sequel because the story was inconsistent, unfocused and slow paced, mainly because too many characters were introduced and unfortunately, none were as captivating as Salander and Blomkvist.  Of course, in the end, I'm reading to learn more about Salander, so in that respect, I am satisfied, and look forward to the next book.

B000MNP2KI|5.0|I love the entire James Bond franchise of movies and I was not disappointed when I saw \\"Casino Royale\\" at the theatres. Daniel Craig was born to play Bond. He has everything a James Bond should have: style, grace, elegance, sex appeal, wittiness, and so much more. \\"Casino Royale\\" also has evrything a James Bond film should have: great villins, sexy leading ladies, action packed sequences, good script, and a wonderful ending. It was also no surprise that \\"Casino Royale\\" became the biggest money-making Bond film, smashing boxoffice records worldwide. More than any other Bond film we really see the other side that was always lacking in most Bond portrayals in that we see a human side to Bond. This is evident when Bond deals with the death of one of his leading ladies. It is very heartbreaking and the audience becomes instantly warmed to Daniel's performance. I would say \\"Casino Royale\\" is the best Bond film ever. From a power-packed opening to an exciting finale, \\"Casino Royale\\" will please the most Bond enthusiasts. The DVD has many bonuses including interviews, trailers, and so much more. However, buy the DVD for the film itself: it outshines all other James Bond films. The filmakers should be proud!
0316017922|5.0|This morning at Villa Market in Pattaya, Thailand I picked up Malcolm Gladwell's Outliers, a thrilling book, for 325 baht, $9.55 or roughly ten bucks. Gladwell, the author of Blink and The Tipping Point, is a stone gas, as we used to say. I'm totally stoked.    Gladwell cites the experience of the Beatles in Hamburg, playing 8 hours a night, 7 days a week, to prove one of his theses: to be supergreat at anything you have to practice a lot more than anyone else is likely to practice. A few pages before I came to that statement, I thought of the Beatles as an example. Not only that, I thought of something Gladwell didn't take into account (not up to page 60, anyway); beginning as young teenagers, Paul and John wrote hundreds of songs before they got good at it. Again, practice.    I've read thousands and thousands of books and only God knows how many magazines. That's why I became rich and famous as an editor/proofreader.

0452289963|1.0|If you don't know anything about Buddhism or Eastern philisophy this book might present a new way of looking at things in an easy to read, simplified way. If you are familiar with Buddhist thought at all, you might find this simplistic and covering familiar ground. (be present, be aware, observe your reactions without acting them out).    I found his writing style annyoying and often condescending and judgemental. (For example on p 217 he writes \\"If you don't become speechless when looking out into space on a clear night, you are not really looking, not aware ot the totality of objects that are there.\\" In all his presenting of how broad minded he supposedly is, he still has one reaction in mind as the \\"right\\" or \\"enlihtened\\" one. And this is typical of the book).     Also, he often writes in the first person and it was like listening to some bore who won't shut up even though you got the point 10 minutes ago.     He re-tells old asian stories, sometimes updating them (p197 a man wins the lottery and buys a car instead of a peasant gets a horse). Why? The ancient version still speaks to the issue today. Does he think he is clever or that the reader is too dumb to handle a farmer story and make the connection to life today?    Instead of this book I would recommend:  -Anything by the Dalai Lama.  -Emotional Alchemy: How the Mind Can Heal the Heart by Tara Bennett Goleman  A western psychotherapist talks about how meditation can help heal the emotions.  -Anything by Pema Chodron. Even if you have to breeze over some of the unfamiliar terms (like \\"tonglen\\") you will get what she is talking about.     Obviously not everyone will agree with me, but to me this book was like being handed potato chips and kool-aid as a substitute for a real meal. If you still like it better after reading these books, fine, but at least try the good stuff so you can appreciate what you are missing.

006056251X|3.0|The Devil in Winter is a very uneven romance in many respects. At least it is not full of Wallflowers all plotting and scheming, like the first two books. However, that does not make it more romantic. Instead it is Evie's relatives all out to get her money who do the plotting and scheming. Sebastian has married Evie Jenner for her money, so we are never sure if what he is doing is because he truly cares about her, or his own self-interest.<br />Her coming to love him is very vague at best-he helps her, she loves him. The love scenes are ok but there are very few of them, and the rest of the time is Sebastian rescuing her, ordering her around, and basically treating her like a twit.  She does not really grow and change very much in the book compared with Sebastian, who is very different from the man we saw in the Autumn book, and not really very believable as a result.<br />An aristocrat throwing himself into the running of a gambling den and whore house is very unlikely, and the whole issue with Cam the Romany (gipsy) and how people treat him gets really tired after a while. The incident with Cam and Daisy hints at a possible future relationship in later books, but is about the only hot thing in this one.<br />Once again, I expected heat, fire, passion, and got, well, an average tale with a bit of action and adventure at the end. This is the same 'formula' as the previous books in the series, and works about the same in this one. This is a light read to pass the time, but nothing new or memorable apart from maybe Cam, who will get his own book in Mine Till Midnight, the Hathaways series.

I've worn thru my copies of both \\"Hopes & Fears\\" as well as \\"Under the Iron Sea\\" - but only listened to this one twice before putting it aside.    It's just a totally different Keane. The powerful vocals are missing. The piano is missing. And it's all replaced with a techno-like beat that reminds me of the 80s.     I do like this type of music, too - but it wasn't what I was expecting from this trio. A real disappointment.

The setting in this book, a lethargic farm, was very similar to those I had hated and for about 100 pages I also hated this book. It came as a surprise when I realized I loved it.    Despite what many think, the characters are only at first glance one-dimensional. As the story progresses that you realize that things are not as they seem. The supposedly good Aron is ungrateful, the supposedly bad Caleb is repentant. As a matter of fact, I found myself openly rooting for Caleb and hoping he'd make the most out of the story's theme. The book also contains one of the most interesting, and perhaps most evil, female characters in all of literature: Cathy. The first-hand account of her miscreant doings and psychopathic thoughts was quite simply incredible.    And I must say that the ending of this book was fantastic. It was both uplifting and powerfully written. I couldn't put the book down, which has happened to me only about ten times. I definitely recommend this book as it is now one of my favorites. It stresses the importance of choice and that, despite the expected outcome, a person is always in possession of it.
B00127RAJY|5.0|Jillian Michael's 30-Day Shred workout video is superb! I love that it is fast (20 minute workout and you're done) and effective. Her circuit training approach of strenght, cardio and abs keeps the workout moving and helps work your body in three different ways to get the most benefit out of your workout! I appreciate that there are three workouts on the video so that when the first workout gets easier you can move up to the second more challenging workout and then on to the third as you progress! I would recommend this video to anyone looking for a challenging but effective workout!

B001NFNFNU|5.0|An amazing, riveting and powerful story about the evils of the political system and the determination it takes to fight it. Angelina Jolie stars as the woman who loses her son and is rewarded by the LAPD with a boy who isn't hers - just to make them look good. John Malkovich is especially nice as the Social Gospel preacher who campaigns against the corruption of the police department - all Christian ministers should be like this. Also poingnant is the portrayal of the insane asylum where Jolie's character is put after she dares to suggest that the government is wrong and that women might know more than the police. I cried, cheered, and cursed against the evils of the power of the state and the courageous individuals who stood up against them. And if you think things are better now than in 1928 - friends, think again.
1891252089|5.0|this is a classic yoga manual that i've used for years, but beginners must be aware that it does not \\"teach\\" you how to do yoga. only an experienced yoga instructor can do that! if you've been practicing yoga with a teacher and would like to work on - i.e. PRACTICE - the primary series at home, this book is for you. the illustrations are wonderful, the descriptions helpful and accurate, and as others have mentioned the binding stays flat when opened, so it's very easy to use while practicing.
B001H5X7I4|5.0|Loved it.  I've seen it several times and it never ceases to make me laugh.  It's over the top and EVERYONE in the movie is absolutely fantastic.  And this is coming from a guy that in general does not like Ben Stiller, Jack Black or Tom Cruise.   Robert Downey Jr. really does live up to all the hype.  He's just flipping amazing here.    This movies gets all the \\"little things\\" right to, like the fake stories about the actors playing the guys in Tropic Thunder, the war vet played by Nick Nolte and the explosions tech played by Danny McBride.  Two thumbs up, 5 stars.
0307269981|5.0|Wow!  I just finished \\"The Girl Who Played With Fire\\", the second of Stieg Larsson's Swedish books.  This series is hard to categorize; mystery, maybe; social commentary, no doubt; thought-provoking, exciting, satisfying, definitely.<br />  Though it would be best to read his books in order, the first being \\"The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo\\", this book can stand on its own.  Lisbeth Salander is a most interesting character, and the new book brings information about her early life that we could only wonder about in the first book.<br />  Larsson died after completing the third book of this series, and it was, to me, a great loss.  Though his locale is in another country, the book speaks to the reader in a way only a fine writer can achieve.  I enjoyed the look into the lives of the Swedes, but I didn't even try to pronounce the proper names!<br />  This is a fine book.  I highly recommend it and its predecessor.  You won't be sorry.

B001QTXM5Y|5.0|Watchmen is without a doubt the greatest comic book adaptation ever done. One thing I appreciate is the fact that the movie so closely follows the graphic novel. Very little is changed during the film adaptation, and what is does not take away from the story at all. You really have to watch the movie more than once in order to appreciate the attention to detail given. You will see so many parallels to our 1985 with the Watchmen storyline intertwined. One example is before Laurie and Dan fight the gang off you can see on the wall of the alley posters advertising famine aid for Africa. Difference being it has Veidt's picture on it as opposed to celebrities of our era. Little things like that, which the average viewer may not even notice, are prevalent throughout the movie. The soundtrack is incredible and I especially love the opening credits where the history of the Minutemen and later the Watchmen are shown intertwined with actual history, like the first Silk Specter painted on the side of a B-17 bomber during WWII in the same vein as Betty Grable.<br /><br />It's really no surprise that viewers are torn over the movie. I believe a lot of the bad reviews stem from people who have never read the graphic novel and maybe do not understand the concept of the story. Personally I don't read comic books, but I did read Watchmen just before the movie came out. Make no mistake; this is a movie you have to pay close attention to in order to fully appreciate it because the story is so deep. Some criticize it, saying parts of it are a political ploy, particularly the scene where Veidt is arguing with the oil and coal industries over clean, renewable energy. Fact is; this is straight from the book, which was written in 1985. The argument over fossil fuels and renewable energy is nothing new.<br /><br />I think another reason for viewers feeling torn is not only is it extremely graphic (and definitely not something for kids to watch), it shatters the mold of every superhero stereotype out there. This is definitely NOT a \\"feel good\\" movie like Spiderman. Instead it makes you feel like what it would be like if super heroes actually existed, thereby making the story more believable. The characters are very much flawed, especially Blake the Comedian. Some of his actions are downright evil, and yet he is supposed to be one of the good guys. The paradoxes jump out and smack you across the face. Spiderman's so-called \\"dark side\\" becomes completely laughable when compared to Blake or Rorschach. What we find is that super heroes are indeed human and flawed like the rest of us...even Dr. Manhattan (though he is the only one with true super powers), for as time progresses he becomes more detached and nihilistic.<br /><br />The added scenes to the Director's Cut have been covered, so I won't address those again here. Suffice it to say, they add more depth to the story and clarify things that those who saw the theatrical version without having read the book would find puzzling.<br /><br />There will always be two groups of people with strong feelings about Watchmen. You will either love it or hate it, and it's unlikely that one side can ever convince the other otherwise. You can count me in the former category, as I feel this movie, and indeed the graphic novel, are timeless and deep in their story-telling. The messages of Watchmen are just as relevant today as they were in 1985, and probably always will be. Given the attention to detail and how closely the movie follows the book, the \\"unfilmable\\" graphic novel has indeed been filmed and to the highest standards.This is definitely NOT a \\"feel good\\" movie like Spiderman.

B00127RAJY|5.0|O. K. Call me the fitness DVD queen...well purchase queen that is.  My workout videos runneth over.  I've bought SEVERAL and now most are dust collectors.  I quickly grew tired of the \\"perky\\" instructors cheering me on at 6 a.m. saying just 8 more, now 7, 6, etc thru plastered smiles and matching clothes.  That's not what I needed.  I wanted a TRAINER.  I have been a faithful viewer of the Biggest Loser and I loved Jillians tactics.  What I wouldn't do to be one of her students.  So while doing my regular DVD hunt I came across the 30 day shred and decided to order.   This is the best DVD I have purchased!  It really is a \\"butt kicker\\" and I was glad not to have the \\"cheerleader\\" instructor but an actual trainer. I am currently on my tenth day and I haven't even thought about throwing in the towel unlike previous experiences.  Its only 20 minutes and I'm not going to lie,it can be hard at times because it makes you work.  Strength to cardio to abs and you chose when you are ready for the next level of intensity. Working 12 hour shifts along with being a wife and football mom I certainly don't have hours to spend in a gym.  My husband is already starting to notice.  He said I'm getting my curves back and this was only after 9 days!  Jillian rocks!
B0026RHR6K|1.0|The packaging is cheap, tacky and horrible.   It's obvious that over time, the discs will become so scratched as to become un-playable.  Also there is no book or guide of any sort.  I had to go online and download a guide.  The DVD quality was distractingly bad, flat and almost one dimensional.  I exchanged the set for a the Blu-Ray, bought a Blu_ray player and boy what a difference!  The packaging is the same but the Blu-Ray's image quality is spectacular and the extras are fantastic.    And as for the series itself?  Battlestar Galactica is simply the best show ever in the history of television.
B001V7UXG2|5.0|This collection of Fry & Laurie in \\"Jeeves and Wooster\\" is a real treasure. It features a young Stephen Fry (as Jeeves, the \\"gentleman's gentleman\\") and a positively boyish Hugh Laurie as the feckless Bertie Wooster. The plots retain their Wodehouse silliness, and the ensemble playing of the two stars is breathtakingly clever. This version of the book is regarded as the best ever made, and it is truly wonderful. A bonus is the many opportunities for Hugh Laurie to play the piano; he performs a very funny selection of contemporary songs (the stories take place in England and New York in the 1920s and 1930s).<br /><br />Wooster is a well-to-do English gentleman. The intelligent and organized Jeeves smoothly arranges all the logistics of Bertie's life, frequently bailing him out of awkward situations. Bertie Wooster is well-meaning, but in many ways rather dim (though he smartens up a bit over the seasons with Jeeves's subtle tutelage). There are many witty moments, many charming moments, and never a dull moment. For me, though, the best gift of this collection is the opportunity to see these two fine actors in their early days work together seamlessly to pull off one of the great British comedies. A must-see for anyone who likes Hugh Laurie in \\"House\\" or Stephen Fry in \\"Kingdom\\" or \\"Bones.\\"
B0021L8US0|5.0|This summer it seems that Science Fiction is finally returning, after an extended leave of absence while the audience was fed pop-corn science fantasy.    District 9 is a gritty and deeply disturbing film that is also incredibly timely.  In a moment in history when we are actually debating if it is alright to let people die because they cannot afford to pay us for health care or food, this movie grimly follows one man's life as he becomes simply a commodity for others' profit.  It exposes our sometimes thoughtless cruelty.. and sometimes deliberate cruelty as a species and leaves the viewer to ask themselves if thats what we really want to be.    One warning: This movie is graphically brutal.  I think it was necessary in order for it to accomplish what it set out to do, but it is often not an easy movie to watch.    This might be the most important movie of the year... if its not too far over the heads of those it needs to reach.
B001U9BRNE|5.0|By far, this is my favorite concert.  Whenever I have guest over, I play this concert.  By the time they leave, they want to buy one!  Watching this on bluray on a 52\\" LCD and surround sound, they are just amazed.  To be able to hear every instrument playing along with great songs makes this concert great.  Whenever you watch something over and over, it must be good!
B001KVZ6FW|5.0|I thought this was a really good and very funny film! Carl, Russell, and Dug are the perfect team of comedy! When Carl is a young boy, he meets a new friend named Ellie and find that they both love adventure. They get married and spend their lives together. When Ellie passes away, Carl becomes depressed and forgets about his old promise to Ellie about visiting Paradise Falls in South America. Carl is soon visited by a little boy named Russell, who is trying to get his \\"Assisting the Elderly\\" badge. Carl soon turns his house into an airship using thousands of balloons. He finds out that Russell was still on his house and assists him in his adventures. Carl runs into his boyhood hero, who actually turns out to be his enemy. With the help of Russell and Dug, the lovable talking dog, Carl tries to save a female bird named Kevin by any means necessary. I highly recommend that you go UP!!!
1433502410|5.0|This is an amazing Bible. The notes are fantastic and go well with my Nelson's New Illustrated Bible Dictionary. This Bible helped me through my last year of college in my Biblical Studies. It showed me things that I truly didn't know, since I really didn't go to church (still looking for the right one). So far, it has fit in with my studies of history, especially concerning the Byzantine Empire and the Middle East. This Bible also contains a back section full of many insights into other things, like Islam. This is a well rounded Bible, which I much prefer to my Reformation Study Bible, Oxford Study Bible, NKJ Study Bible, and others. This is my favorite and also the heaviest.
B000AYQJ3I|5.0|All the charity concert videos tend to blend together, but this one stands out:  First, it was the VERY FIRST charity concert and second, it features all the greats!      In the Beatles George Harrison was smothered by John Lennon and Paul McCartney but his genius shines through.    A must have for any Rock-n-roll fan.
1594202249|2.0|OK, OK, I agree this is \\"joyous romp throught he 60's,\\" but after the first 100 pages it becomes a bit tiresome. Yes, I too get a kick out of both the 60's references and the So Cal references - I was part of them both - but the same effect could have been had in a short story.    This is a great book in much the same way that \\"Ulysses\\" was a great book - both are a pain in the ass to read. Maybe a flashback to that windowpane I took in '71 would help. If \\"Inherent Vice\\" is random, at least it's shallow.    If you want to laugh, and don't mind laughing at the same gags for 369 pages, this one is for you. Personally, I'll take my need for high smart-ass dialogue balanced by a well crafted plot, complex characterizations and a confrontation with social dilemmas. Pynchon couldn't carry James Lee Burke's typewriter (or laptop, or whatever.)

Don't be afraid to give violin music a try...this is NOT your grandmother's music...he performs a blending of different kinds of music and you would be amazed at his renditions of Metalica, Queen and Vivaldi!  His selections are varied and shows his wide range of ability...give this one a try!
0887307280|2.0|Given the great reviews and recommendation for this book, I may have gotten more out of it had I read it.  But I listened to the Audio version.  It was terrible.  I bought it for a car trip and I wanted to hang myself after listening for an hour or two.  The author has a slow nasal whining delivery that drove me crazy.  Every time he over aspirated the word \\"pie\\", which he must have said nearly one thousand times because his example was a pie store, I felt like I needed to wipe spit from my face.      I actually deleted the file from my player.  It was so horrible I knew I would never listen to it again.
6305428042|5.0|I remember when this movie first came out at the theater.  We went to see it late at night for a \\"Sneak Peak\\" showing.  It was great then, and stands up to the test of time.  Fantastic performances from everyone...even the kids did a great job.  It's just scary enough, just funny enough for the whole family.  We watch it all the time.  It never gets tiresome or old...a classic you are sure to enjoy.  My only dilemma with it is that the portrayal of witches is so negative, I have found myself having to explain to my children that not all witches are \\"bad,\\" and this is Hollywood's invention...not really close to the reality of witches at all.  I would imagine that most folks won't find it necessary to defend the reputation of witches, but I did.  Again, a great film for the whole family!
B00003CXZ4|4.0|This film shows the formal qualities of film that can be utilized like no other medium.  First time watching it is breathtaking.  Second time looses a lot of the magic/wonder, but you start to see HOW this story was constructed in a way that telling it backwards is the most exciting and dynamic way to tell it.
B0028K31CE|4.0|While it is no \\"Urban Hang Suite\\", it is still a very good album.  It took a few days for me to really connect with this album, but I can now say that I have and I really do enjoy it particularly \\"Stop the World\\" and \\"Fistful of Tears\\".  One thing that I love about Maxwell is his ability to create a piece of art that doesn't sound redundant.  Unlike like some of the other contemporary artists whose current album sounds like his/her last album, you can't say that about Maxwell.  One thing is for sure, I can't wait to hear the next two albums!!
B0000640VO|5.0|I've loved the work of this director (and his earlier partner) since Delicatessen.  Each of their films is uniquely visual, and Amelie is no exception.  They have a flare for composition and camera movement like nothing you've ever seen.  But Amalie has added to it a sweetness and whimsy that is lost in some of their earlier, darker films.
B001FB55MG|5.0|I was expecting a Disney movie that happened to star Adam Sandler.  Instead, I got an Adam Sandler movie that is actually suitable for kids.  (disclaimer: I'm an Adam Sandler fan and have a more favorable view of his body of work than most movie critics.)  Even though this is a Disney movie, all the telltale signs of a Sandler movie are there: a kind, simple minded protagonist who battles an arrogant bad guy; an attractive woman who wants nothing to do with Sandler but eventually falls in love with him; Sandler speaking in funny voices; Rob Schneider playing a weirdo; bit parts for Tim Herlihy and Allen Covert; and a soundtrack loaded with 80's music.    The Amazon editorial review pretty much sums up the movie.  Sandler plays a hotel handy man that babysits his niece and nephew.  Their bedtime stories come true.  Craziness ensues.  Sandler saves the day.  There are plenty of jokes and references for adults and plenty of wacky adventures and visual gags for kids.  Sandler proved that he can make a funny movie suitable for the whole family, and he didn't even need Drew Barrymore to do it.  Notable supporting actors include Guy Pearce as the bad guy, Russell Brand as the sidekick, Keri Russell as the love interest, Courtney Cox as the sister, Lucy Lawless (Xena!) as the bad girl, and Richard Griffiths (Vernon Dursley) as the hotel owner.
B000007638|5.0|This is one of the best live recordings of McCartney I have ever heard, and I say that having collected Beatle-related releases for many years. If you want the definitive version of \\"Maybe I'm Amazed,\\" this one's for you. If you want to hear what the Beatles circa 1975 would have sounded like, check out \\"Call Me Back,\\" perhaps one of McCartney's finest vocal performances ever. The lovely \\"Blackbird\\" puts in an appearance, as does a chilling and memorable performance of \\"Yesterday.\\" \\"The Long and Winding Road,\\" with its beautiful, Penny Lane-like interlude and harmonious rejoinder, \\"don't keep me waiting,\\" is another highlight not to miss. The Wings stuff is pretty good, too, but if you love McCartney, you don't want to miss this one.
0143113100|5.0|My review will be more of a description of how I felt before I read the book versus how I feel after, to give an insight into the effects of this book.     I'm the type of person that likes to get down to first-principle truths: to me, there's no point discussing something if the foundation of the discussion isn't based in reality. I like to dig deep.     And so, although I never really knew much about the brain before reading this book, I did know that I was feeling bogged-down by the baggage I carry around in my head:     Why do I do the things I do? What motivates me and why? What should I do next? Am I stuck with my current habits, good or bad, for life? Is there any point in trying to change myself? If so, how?    It seemed like any motivation to actually DO something was stifled by these questions, going round n round in my head ad nauseum.     Now, after reading the book, I feel liberated.     I feel freed from the self-destructive brain loop that had been going on in my head because I started to understand how it worked. In turn, I felt freed from the general constraints of a hard-wired brain philosophy that makes one limit their capacity to change.     The brain is alive, not a machine, and simply needs certain inputs to feel healthy (ie happier). Surprisingly, this was a huge revelation for me. Little brain puzzles always seemed like a waste of time, and so I never attempted them. I kept thinking \\"Sudoku is just going to make me better at Sudoku, that's it.\\" But these aren't just \\"stupid\\" little exercises. Every new exercise & experience, as insignificant as it seems, is much more therapeutic than I gave credit for.     I used to get frustrated at these puzzles, but now I don't because I know it's good for my brain to go through the process. Amazingly, my patience in other parts of life has also improved. It spills over to other parts of the brain because there are no \\"brain compartments\\". Again, the brain is NOT a machine. Every little thing helps.     Western society seems overly obsessed with physical well being, and mental health gets a back seat. Eastern philosophies seem to have this mental edge, and this book gives credence to their ways, explaining it in the western-scientific language we are used to.     This book is basically a guide to mental health (ie a guide to prolonged happiness, to be interpreted by yourself). It gives you the ability to identify your mental roadblocks, and the methods and motivation to overcome them. Be your own shrink, ha.     I now feel motivated to embrace new situations and activities with open arms - especially if I know I'll suck at them and even if they may embarrass me. Life, for me, has gone from being intimidating to becoming an endless stream of little brain puzzles. I don't take life so seriously now.     The three take home points are:    - Pay attention to learn something (having trouble paying attention? you can practice paying attention - it's called meditation, although this book doesn't cover that. I wish it did!)  - Use it or lose it (for better or worse - to kick bad habits and pick up new ones)  - After improving (you surely will), try out a new thing by applying step 1    Repeat as necessary, and feel better.
B000SFP64W|3.0|Yes, I know the Hendrix family owns the franchise now.  And, yes, Jimi was THE pioneer hard rock guitarist (I love Clapton, too!).  This product is a mash.  For those who grew up with the original 'Are You Experienced?' set, this is heresy.  The cuts are the same 1997 Eddie Kramer mix, but the order of the songs is jumbled up.  The songs may be 'generation' copies...I can't say for sure, but the sound was disappointing to one expecting an incremental improvement in sound quality.  On the 1997 release the songs are in their original order.  This is important.  This is the best of the group's output, and made them a sensation in 1965.  There is no discernable improvement in this new edition (if it can be called that accurately).  I have the Universal-Japan product, which I felt had to be a sonic improvement, but hey, it's not.  And the order of the songs gives this the feel of a 'greatest hits' set.  Actually, the greatest hits of the Jimi Hendrix Experience IS the original songs in their original order.  Sorry, but the three stars would be less if the songs themselves were not so fantastic.  Buy the 1997 release (REALLY!).
0618918248|1.0|\\"There are more things in heaven and earth, Horatio, Than are dreamt of in your philosophy.\\" - Hamlet Act 1, scene 5<br /><br />IMHO, Dawkins shows every evidence of being a clever but small-minded man.<br /><br />George Johnson's review of Dawkin's book presents him as rejecting the possibility of \\"a prime mover sophisticated enough to create and run the universe, 'to say nothing of mind reading millions of humans simultaneously.' Such an entity, he argues, would have to be extremely complex, raising the question of how it came into existence, how it communicates...and where it resides.\\"<br /><br />This line of thought reminds me of the ID folks in an absurd, turned around sort of way. To Dawkins, the universe is such a big, complicated place that any god who could run it would be too complex for his mind to grasp so, QED, there is no god.  Also reminds me of the Russian cosmonauts who came back down from space and, with a straight face, proclaimed that they saw no god. As if they were expecting a giant eyeball pressed against the window of their capsule, ala Gary Larson's Far Side.<br />Dawkins has made it clear that sooner than admit an eternal, omniscient, and omnipresent God who never needed to \\"come into existence\\" and who transcends both time and space (since both are God's creation), he would prefer to speculate on the possible existence of highly evolved space aliens who seeded the universe with genetic material. Dawkin's infantile calling of aliens to his rescue of course begs the question of where these aliens came from.<br /><br />\\"I believe in Christianity as I believe that the sun has risen: not only because I see it, but because by it I see everything else\\" -C.

B00005NB0H|4.0|For those who are looking for an improved-sound version of the 1995 remaster of Live at Leeds, I would say there is no detectable sonic improvement here (the sound is fine on the first disc).  For Who 'completists' the live performance of Tommy is of value (the second disc).  Beware, however, the playing is a bit rough.  The remastered 1995 Tommy is, in contrast, all studio recordings, but magnificent in terms of sound quality.  The Who was one of the greatest live acts ever (for those who missed their 1965-1973 prime).  It's a shame so little (other than the original Live at Leeds set, and much of the Isle of Wight set) maintains this high quality showmanship.  Also, beware of the DVD Live at Kilburn...the sound is excellent, and the video very good, but the band puts in a sub-par performance.
B00064WSNW|5.0|\\"Discipline\\" is not only one of my favorite King Crimson recordings, but it is one of my favorite recordings period!  I first purchased it on LP when it came out in 1981, when I was 13 years old.  I was instantly taken with this album, and my enthusiasm for this great work has not waned one bit.  If Crimson is to be divided into an \\"old and a \\"new\\", the \\"new\\" being the Belew era, then \\"Discipline is my favorite Crimson album of the newer era.  The older Crimson was a very \\"English\\" progressive rock band, like Yes, ELP, Genesis, etc.  When this album came out it heralded a very different sound for the band.  The \\"new\\" Crimson \\"bowed it's head\\" to bands like the Talking Heads, as well as \\"World Music\\".  This was partly due to the inclusion of two Americans in the band, Adrian Belew and Tony Levin.  What is found on this album is a variety of great music, very cutting edge for its time, played with the precision that one would expect from these four musical virtuosos.  Despite the fact that it was originally released in 1981, it does not sound antiquated at all.  Proof crimson was ahead of its time.<br /><br />There are some truly magical tracks on \\"Discipline\\".  \\"Elephant Talk\\", with Belew mimicking a trumpeting elephant on his guitar.....amazing!  Robert Fripp's beautiful, minimalist guitar part on \\"Frame by Frame\\".  The wild chaos that is \\"Thela Hun Ginjeet\\", with Belew's \\"Hendrix\\" like use of feedback.  The controlled chaos that is \\"Indiscipline\\", with Bill Bruford's monster drumming.  \\"The Sheltering Sky\\", undoubtedly named for Paul Bowles novel of the same name, quiet, yet with an underlying sense of dread , and an exoticism that certainly brings Bowles novel to mind.  The track \\"Discipline\\" has Fripp and Belew playing minimalist, repetitive, intertwining guitars like the interlocking rings of the quasi-celtic design on the album cover. \\"Matte Kudasai\\" is, I feel, the weakest track, but it still has its merits, like Belew's Bird sounds. One must not forget Tony Levin's great Chapman Stick and bass guitar playing which, along with Bruford's drumming, provides one of the most impressive rhythm sections in the history of rock music.<br /><br />This is truly a landmark recording for Crimson, every Crimson fan should have a copy, as should any fan of great music which pushes boundaries and sets new paradigms.  Do yourself a favor and pick this masterpiece up and give it a listen.  You will not be disappointed, I promise.reat Chapman Stick and bass guitar playing which, along with Bruford's drumming, provides one of the most impressive rhythm sections in the history of rock music.

B000VPUIA6|3.0|It's hard to remember when director Richard Lester was viewed as an auteur and was one of the leading lights in world cinema, but there were a couple of years in the mid-1960s when that was the case. With the one-two punch of A Hard Day's Night and The Knack...And How to Get It, which actually won the Palm d'Or at Cannes, Lester's modish mix of stylish location shooting around London with slapstick antics derived from his love of silent film epitomised an entire era. His intial colour films, Help! and A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum were nothing less than gorgeous pieces of pop art, utterly beguiling if ultimately trivial, with Forum (one of my all-time favourite films) applying Lester's ravishing eye to swinging ancient Rome instead of swinging London. The London we see in Help!, rows of brick townhouses and bleak urban centres, splashed with bits of colour and fashion and steeped in youth culture, were surely an enormous influence on Antonioni's Blow-Up. Of all of Lester's run of films in the mid-60s, however, Help! is the least successful, partly because Lester is taking his approach to its most extreme, largely tossing out narrative in favour of slapstick and visuals. The film is the equivalent of The Knack's improvised scenes of that film's three young protagonists running around London with the bed, but extended out to full movie length. Some of the bits in Help! are genius. When the boys are introduced, entering their row of adjoining townhouses, and we follow them inside to discover that they are all living in one enormous house, colour-coded into various \\"regions\\" for each of the boys, it's a deliriously funny conceit. The ensuing nonsense was the entire inspiration for the American TV series The Monkees. In the end, however, Help! lags because it just can't sustain any forward momentum. Despite frequently gorgeous images and fine music, you find your attention wandering. The boys themselves are exceedingly wooden actors, so the burden of things fall on a supporting cast of veteran British comic and Shakespearean actors. They're all game, but it's ultimately to little avail. And in the end, Help! is the only one of Lester's films I haven't wanted to see more than once.
0385340990|5.0|What a wonderful book!  I did not want to put it down!  The author draws one in to the very dear  characters living on the island of Guernsey. They have survived so many hardships--the occupation of their island by the Germans during WWII but have come through as strong survivors.  There is so much warmth and love in their interactions with each other (except for Adalaide).  The book is filled with lots of tongue-in-cheek humor. It is a must read!  ---Marilyn Marzolf
B0017KIBAI|5.0|This is the official Nintendo Gamecube controller. This, obviously, can be used on the gamecube and also the Wii. This controller looks amazing in it's clean, stylish white color. What is really nice about this certain colored gamecube controller is that it matches the Wii's color, and more importantly, has a longer cable than the other colors.     This is overall a great purchase to anyone looking to play Gamecube games, and certain Wii games such as Super smash Bros. Brawl or Mario Kart Wii.
B002LB7S10|4.0|I read a few of the reviews and by the sound of them, I thought this would be a movie that I'd have to cover my eyes and fast forward a lot through. I can't watch films like what I imagine SAW would be like. Those kinds of films can stain the brain.<br /><br />I watched this because one person said it wasn't as horrific as all that. I didn't have to blink, fast forward or so much as turn my head. There are bad things that happen, but I would not call this an \\"over the top\\" gore movie. Yes, people get stabbed, poked, and otherwise beaten. But as one reviewer put it, it actually works well. It's merely part of the film and not for the sake of spreading blood all over the place in some teen-ager slasher film. It works here.<br /><br />Now that I've seen it I can tell you there are far worse films that will get into your head and make you want to watch a cartoon after words to clear your mind. This isn't one of those. I watched it in the dark and I'm not going to have any trouble sleeping tonight at all.
B001FB55H6|5.0|This movie was awesome. I loved the whole movie. The acting was great. I really enjoyed the flow of the film. It really kept you guessing. Because it's kinda like a mystery investigation for most of the movie. But what I liked most was the soul and mythology of the film. The movie didn't sugar coat anything. And in this genre everything gets sugar coated. Because movies have to appeal to a grandmother, teenager, male and female.    I have not read the watchman graphic novel but at least as a movie it was great. I highly recommend this for anyone that wants something raw and not dummied down. It was very refreshing.    .    I can say this movie was one of the best movies in the last decade. and in my top 10 overall.    Thanks for reading and enjoy your afternoon.
B0021L8US0|5.0|For those of you expecting an unsatisfying, empty calorie, popcorn fest you better check your appetite at the door.  District 9 is a slow cooked, flame kissed, filet of science fiction that is unlike anything I've ever seen.  It's fills you up, leaves you satisfied and surprisingly doesn't give you the \\"Hershey Squirts\\" the next day.<br /><br />District 9 is the bizarre love child of first time film director Neill Blomkamp and mega director, Peter Jackson.  Way back when Halo was supposed to become a major motion picture, Jackson was signed on to produce and Blomkamp was tapped to direct.  The film eventually fell apart and Jackson decided to turn Blomkamp's amazing short film, \\"Alive in Joburg\\" into a summer blockbuster.  Alive in Joburg was a fake documentary about Aliens living among us in the slums of Johannesburg, South Africa.  District 9 is more or less the full length vision of that short film.  It deals with a race of aliens derogatively known as \\"Prawns\\" who are struggling to survive in a man made slum of Johannesburg known as District 9.  The aliens are called \\"Prawns\\" due to their resemblance of the sea creature with the same name (that's shrimp to us Americans).  I personally think they look the twisted offspring of a cockroach after it received the evil seed of The Great Cthulu.<br /><br />The whole film is heavy with its social commentary and leave it to the sci-fi genre to make one of the most eye opening films in the past decade.  It effectively deals with issues such as political power, corrupt corporations, biological weapons, racism, xenophobia, the poor class and much more.  Surprisingly, the movie deftly packs its dime-bag of sticky-icky knowledge drug into your pipe without ever smelling like a heavy handed propaganda film.  District 9 is effectively chilling with its sledgehammer to the skull portrayal of these dilapidated alien slum dwellings, yet don't be surprised when it causes you to genuinely smile or laugh.  Leave it to a disciple of Jackson to make it easy to relate to a CG creature.  I haven't felt this much empathy for a home stricken alien since E.T.<br /><br />If there is but one flaw it's the heavy use of CG in the film.  For a sci-fi flick that wears its realism on its sleeve, the aliens come across as hokey.  They are finely detailed and superbly animated but they can still rip you out of the experience.  However, they are so perfectly developed as sentient-beings through excellent exposition that they eventually become remarkably believable.  This helps keep things grounded which is important since the film is filled with many far-fetched devices such as high tech weaponry that looks like it was ripped out of Unreal Tournament or Ratchet and Clank.<br /><br />The documentary storytelling is driven by handheld camera shots, security cam footage and even mock interviews.  It all feels as cohesive as something you would watch on CNN or the Military Channel.  This approach does cause the pacing to be very uneven and some people might get frustrated with this.  I however was fully entranced with Wickus van der Merwe's (Shartlo Copley) startling voyage that shakes the pillars of his every belief and changes his life.  His genuine depiction of an average Joe caught up in extraordinary circumstances is highly believable and surprisingly relatable thanks to the flawed nature of his character.  You will ride his emotional rollercoaster right alongside him and it gives the movie soul which elevates District 9 above the typical dreck that infests the cinemas during the swamp-[...] inducing summer months.<br /><br />District 9 is one of the best Sci-Fi films I've ever seen and I wholehearted suggest that you see it.  Just see it so that you can support such unique and brilliant filmmaking because I for one want to see what Blomkamp can do after this.  I've done my part and now you need to do yours.  Go watch this movie.<br /><br />Final Grade: At easy to relate to a CG creature.  I haven't felt this much empathy for a home stricken alien since E.T.

B000002UJQ|5.0|I listened to this album many many many times for many years, i can not count. Now we are in 2009. But still everytime I listened, I pass to another world. It never gets old and it will never.    I like many music groups and I listened different music styles which I love to do. But for me Radiohead's music is like an ocean if other groups are like a river. It is deep, mystic, creative, realistic, fantastic, sad, happy, dark, beautiful. It's simply no group sounds like Radiohead. There are many creative groups, But I don't think they truly understand what Radiohead was doing.    Radiohead could be a group just doing one of the best albums of our time, Ok Computer and maybe countinue to do the same thing. Bu they didn't. They countinued their journey making different challenging music. They truly understand human's lonelyness and problems and reflected them to their music. They didn' care about popularity and went in their way with honesty, with respect to art and creativity; which was a few group could achive in history.     Listening to Radiohead is just difficult to describe. It takes you to a different a higher level. Every album they made is a beauty which I always saw them as gifts to the music world and music lovers.
B0024FAR5M|3.0|Call me crazy (go ahead, do it), but a town dominated by a bunch of grown men who all dress like bikers and commit crimes is about as credible as a white-collar married father-of-three being a massive pothead well into his forties.  Let's get real.  You might have difficulty getting into this show because most of the people on the show are, how you say, sorely lacking in reedeming qualities.<br /><br />I watched all the episodes as they premiered on FX and found them to be well-written and well-executed, but I originally tuned in because I'm a Ron Perlman fan.  I've never ridden a motorcycle or broken a beer bottle over anyone's head, but I do enjoy shows that are different.  Katey Sagal and Ron Perlman do a very good job with their characters.<br /><br />To be honest, I had (and have) a hard time caring about the main character, Jax Teller, played by Charlie Hunnam, who seems like a bit of a turkey and hardly the cool-biker-dude-with-somewhat-of-a-conscience that he's supposed to be.  His tall friend Opie is way cooler and much more likeable.  And it's frankly hard to buy Jax's off-and-on-again relationship with his old flame, Tara, who happens to have gone off to medical school and returned a doctor, but who still digs that biker guy she used to date!  (Jay Karnes of \\"The Shield\\" guest-starred on a few episodes as an FBI agent who stalked Tara and I suppose he summed her up appropriately: \\"Once a biker wh*re, always a biker wh*re!\\")  Well, come on, how could she resist such a bad boy as Jax Teller!  I mean, he's like Einstein 'cause he wears the same clothes every day!<br /><br />Despite my misgivings, it's a unique show with an interesting albeit not-always-believable storyline.  I'll be tuning in for season two.  But remember, \\"Sons of Anarchy\\" is no \\"Mad Men\\"!

0393057240|5.0|Irvine Welsh is, hands-down, my favorite author.  Years ago, I saw \\"Trainspotting\\" in the movie theater and definitely thought it was a unique piece of cinema that was worthy of acclaim.  The book upon which it is based, however, is one of the most creative forays in fiction that I've ever encountered.  It's engaging, hilarious, profane, disgusting and riddled with drugs, drunks and bad behavior, not to mention rich with fascinating characters.  Welsh is a literary genius.  You'll definitely learn how to talk like a Scottish guy from the schemes when you read this.  A real page turner, despite the challenging vernacular that Welsh employs.  Enjoy.

B00005JPO1|4.0|I wasn't expecting as much from this movie as with the first three in the series. After all, we're all getting older and as much of a fan of Harrison Ford as I am, it was difficult imagining him doing all the feats of acrobatics performed in the earlier Indiana movies. However, I was not disappointed. I still enjoyed the movie. If George Lucas (or other film maker) plans on continuing the legend of Indiana Jones bloodline, this makes a good start by introducing Indiana's son. Only time will tell if he will follow in his \\"father's\\" footsteps.

B001FB55H6|1.0|I want to say first and foremost I don't care about the comic book or how good it was. I'm grown and don't read comics and haven't done so in over 13 years. I do however watch movies, and that's what my review will be based off of. If you feel the need to comment about how wrong my I am, and how everyone should enjoy this piece of work feel free to do so, but be warned I will completely destroy you, and embarrass you, and leave the remains of your ignorance displayed for all of Amazon to see!<br /><br />With that said I shall start my review.<br /><br />First off I just want to say that this movie was probably the worse over budgeted movie I have seen in a very very very long time. I have nothing against Zack Snyder he is a brilliant silver screen genius. However, this movie should have never been created. This movie was an absolute disappointment. I sat there for 162minutes wanting to turn this movie off, but continued to watch just hoping that some how it would redeem itself, and make the money I spent renting this trash worth my while. unfortunately that moment never came at all.<br /><br />This movie is an embarrassment to any and every superhero movie that has ever been created. It's a slap in the face to the entire comic industry. This movie takes the idea that so many creators, artist, writers, directors, etc. have fought for over the past century and completely demolishes it. This isn't about a group of hero's that put aside their own personal problems to help humanity, it's about a group of fallen hero's that have been tarnished by humanity, and after seeing so much they now decide that they want to play God, and steer the fates of the people that they once walked side by side with. These heroes are nothing like heroes at all, matter of fact they don't even fit the profile of an anti-hero. They are highly flawed self indulgent human beings, who criticize the very same people they protect, and although they are the heroes, they are so tarnished that they can play the villains as well.<br /><br />Why do I hate this movie? Because it destroys what a super hero is, it destroys the nobility and morality that super heroes base their lives upon. You can't even tell who is good or bad in this film, it's just that one side wears masks, and the other doesn't. These hero's never hesitate to take life (whether innocent or not), they don't think twice about adultery, and they don't worry about putting people in danger. I mean what is the point of bothering with trying to pretend to be on the side of the righteous if your just as crooked as the people your catching?<br /><br />Another thing that bites my rear is that this movie goes everywhere but ends up absolutely no where. It tries to have some deep underlying meaning, but it takes 3 hours to get it across, and by the time it does your to appalled by everything you've just seen to even appreciate what message they were trying to convey. This film is absolutely terrible, and I sincerely mean that. There's raunchy sex scene after sex scene and it serves no purpose. It really only deteriorates the film. It's so hard to explain the plot of this story as well, because it branches off into too many different angles, and absolutely none of them are interesting.<br /><br /> To sum it up all you basically learn is that each character has a troubled past that turned them into the demented superhero/villain that you see them as today. This marred from over 3 hours of unnecessary sex scenes, overly violent gore scenes, pointless violence, and very \\"flat\\" monotone acting. It's very hard to find one likeable character in this film as they all are equally unlikable aside from the narrator who needed a throat lozenger, there's absolutely no one to root for.<br /><br /> I honestly didn't care what happened to any of the characters in this film because there was no connection to any of them. They all hated themselves, and damned the human race (yet ironically wanted to save it?). There is absolutely no point to this film! If you can some how scramble some deep meaning from \\"Watchmen\\" that makes it a remarkable masterpiece to be saved for the ages, then please do share it will all of us here at Amazon reviews. Because, in the 3 hours I spent watching this unsatisfying garbage it surely was missed. This is the first time I actually felt angered after watching a movie. Angered I wasted my money to buy it, and angered I wasted time off my life to watch it.<br /><br />If anything can be learned from watchmen it's that big budget will attract big publicity, and that will lead to big sales. This \\"gem\\" of a move WILL be forgotten, and it WILL not be remembered just like plenty of other big budget movies that people barley mention today (ID4 anyone?Armagedon?Fantastic Four? Hulk?etc. etc.) I can't wait to forget that I watched this film, but I will remember to never watch it again. Thank God I rented instead of purchased because had that been I would of mailed it to Warner Bros. with a note that said \\"Keep it\\".<br /><br />This film has a 1 star rating from me. However, you can subtract that star. I don't give this film any rating at all. This isn't a movie, it's an experiment. It's an experiment to see just what type of bull people are willing to sit through and endure. By the end of the film I was wishing Mr. Mahatten had actually nuked me instead just to save me from watching the rest of this film.<br /><br />Garbage... beyond words.ble some deep meaning from \\"Watchmen\\" that makes it a remarkable masterpiece to be saved for the ages, then please do share it will all of us here at Amazon reviews.

1401300901|4.0|What a wonderful book!  I have heard of the movie, and sort of knew the premise, but I haven't seen the movie.  After reading the book, I might have to see the movie.  The story is about Holly, a young woman who has recently lost her husband Gerry.  Before he was sick, the couple, along with their friends, often joked that if one of them died prematurely, the other would make a list for the surviving spouse about silly little things to remind that person about.  After his death, Holly is sent this list, which Gerry wrote for her before her death.  She is allowed to open one envelope a month, and each envelope has a suggestion or activity for Holly to do.  All in all, while life is still hard for Holly after Gerry's death, this list helps her to begin living again.  We follow along with Holly and her group of friends through the ups and downs of life and the various things Gerry has set out for Holly to do.  I really liked the book - I thought it was well written and very heartfelt.  I would definitely recommend it!

0307269981|5.0|The Girl Who Played With Fire by Stieg Larsson<br />After reading last year's The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo, I could not wait for Larsson's second in the millenium trilogy. I think I liked this one even better. We again meet with journalist Mikael Blomkvist and Lisbeth Salander, one of the greatest new characters in fiction. She has a photographic memory, serious computer skills, and her own version of morality.<br />It is a year later and we start with Lisbeth travelling around the world and Blomkvist meeting with a journalist to publish a series of explosive articles and a book on the sex trade in Sweden, one that will expose many high profile people involved. When Lisbeth returns to Sweden, though she isn't speaking to Blomkvist, as she is upset at the end of an affair they had, she keeps track of what he's up to by hacking into his computer. She reads the research that has been done on the sex trade and recognizes a name. She contacts the journalist and his girlfriend, who's graduate thesis started the investigations, and then they turn up murdered. Lisbeth's prints are on the murder weapon, she is the prime suspect and her life is played out on the front pages of every newspaper.<br />In The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo, the story was mostly Blomkvist's, though we met and got to know a bit about Lisbeth Salander. But The Girl Who Played With Fire is most definitely Salander's story. Things we learn about Lisbeth in the first book, her psychiatric history, mysterious past, her expert computer hacking skills, and her barely existent social skills, are front and center in this sequel. Salander's slimy legal guadian from the first novel is back and wants revenge against her. Salander frequently refers to a period in her past as \\"All the Evil \\" which is not explained until near the end. Many questions raised in the first book about Salander are answered in this one. Blomkvist is determined to help Salander and she is determined to do things on her own.<br />Larsson crafts a great plot, though I felt the middle slowed a bit, when it is focused on the investigation by the police and Salander is absent from the story during this period. But then it picks up fast, as we follow the seperate investigations, one by the police, another by Blomkvist and other allies of Salanders, and the one by Lisbeth herself. The intricate story keeps the reader intrigued until the very end when they all merge together. This book was well worth what seemed to be an incredibly long wait, and now I am again waiting, this time for The Girl Who Kicked the Hornet's Nest. I highly recommend this book but you need to have read The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo to fully appreciate this sequel.

B001V7UXG2|5.0|Extremely well done period piece.  This comedy takes place in both England and in New York City.  Based on the books of P.G. Woodhouse.  The episodes can be watched over and over and never fail to delight.  Starring Stephen Fry as Jeeves the intellectual valet and Hugh Laurie as his dim witted high society master.  Interspersed with songs of the day many performed by Hugh Laurie on piano and voice.  Great fun!
B001AVCFK6|5.0|For those of you calling this movie terrible and not true to the original continuum of Star Trek, well first it wasn't terrible, it was excellent. As for the Continuum, if you will not admit it to everyone here, admit it to yourselves...Nemesis was crap, the franchise was dead, and they needed something new. Creating an alternate future does that. And it brings in new fans which will boost the franchise back to life. So please, get over your close-minded timelines and heads, and enjoy the fact that because of JJ and all the rest who worked on making this film great, your Star Trek and mine will live on, at lease until the sequel comes out.

However - once I did, I could not put this phenomenal novel  down and finished it in less than 24 hours. Hosseini paints a brilliant picture of life in war-torn Afghanistan- a life I never would have imagined or could relate to. Quickly you find yourself caring very deeply for these characters and hoping that somehow, someday - they will find happiness and safety in their own homes.<br /><br />The story begins with a young Miriam, a \\"bastard child\\" hidden away in her father's life like a shameful secret. Her mother, depressed by the life handed to her, treats Miriam like disease - showering her with guilt, obscenities, and fear. Miriam understands that she has no one to love her, but young and naive, she has all the love in the world to give and searches for that love within her father. But - is this search for love worth it?<br /><br />We are introduced into the polygamous life of Afghanistan families, the shame women must live in by showing their eyes only to their husband (even though he can show his eyes to as many women as he shall wish) and the fear women live with on a daily basis.  The struggles to survive, to love, and to learn while having no independence or free will to do so.<br /><br />Further in the story we are introduced to a younger character, Laila - who is growing up in the midst of a changing world and life in Afghanistan.  These two women come together in unfortunate circumstances and develop a friendship based on mutual respect, and the eagerness to love - and the want of survival.<br /><br />I found this novel incredibly deep and touching. I don't believe I ever even remotely understood how bad it is over in Afghanistan until I read this book, which I feel is somewhat of an insight into the lives so different from our very own.  Having decided to pick up this novel and read was probably one of the best choices I have made this week.est choices I have made this week.
B001FB4VZS|3.0|Since Smallville came upon the scene over 8 years ago, I have purchased every season except for Season 8, as my wife and myself have enjoyed watching them. As for some of the story lines Season 8 spawned, I hate the fact that Lex was killed off even before Clark has donned the red and blue tights. Lex was a major enemy towards Clark. Bringing in the Tess character, and with Lex and Lana both gone I found the some of the stories weak and lacking excitement. The Lex character even though Mike Rosenbaum left, they should consider resurrecting his character to exact revenge on Clark(Superman).As for the Doomsday character in Season 8 they did well with that. I do hope that Season 9 will introduce more villian's and intrigue to strengthen the series were I feel Season 8 lacked. I will buy Season 8 to add it to my collection, and recap the season in order to prepare for Season 9.

B00005B4GU|3.0|Radiohead<br />Amnesiac; 2001<br />Capitol Records<br /><br />My Rating: 61/100<br /><br />Radiohead's own ZOOROPA...<br /><br />Here we have Radiohead's own ZOOROPA, wherein the band has already changed the game and convinced millions that they will, in fact, love the left turn that the band has taken. So where to next? More of the same with a few twists. And while AMNESIAC is not a bad record, it's not a great one either. I'll dispense with my gripes first. \\"Amnesiac/Morning Bell\\" is unnecessary. The b-sides associated with the album prove that the band had plenty more tricks up its sleeve, and \\"Fog\\" or even the as-yet-unreleased \\"Follow Me Around,\\" might have fit nicely in its place.  Also, \\"Hunting Bears\\" feels like a throwaway, experimental to a pretentious extreme. Lastly, the production on some tracks is a bit too muffled, although I suppose this was somewhat intentional, given the extreme claustrophobia that forms the thematic center of this record. So now that I've got that out of my system, let's talk about what's good and even great. Good: the straightforward \\"Knives Out\\", the darkly hilarious \\"Packt\\", the twisted Dixieland jazz on \\"Life in a Glass House.\\" Great: the lucid dreamscapes of \\"Pyramid Song\\" (a definite career highlight), the hardcore electronica of \\"Pulk\\", the avant-psalm \\"Like Spinning Plates.\\" Although AMNESIAC isn't Radiohead's best album by any means, it nonetheless makes for a fantastic experience every once in a while. Recommended for any and all fans of experimental sounds, and, for that matter, Radiohead.<br /><br />Cohesion (4.5/5)<br />Concept (4/5)<br />Consequence (4/5)<br />Consistency (3/5)<br /><br />Tracks:<br /><br />1.

0451213092|4.0|Ken Follett's engaging prose flows effortlessly through most of  this book  but at times it becomes unaccountably  prosaic.  As some reviewers have suggested, there seems to be quite a bit of the voice of Ross Perot here.      Quibblers suggest that nothing heroic was done to rescue two imprisoned hostages (for that is really what they were: hostages).  Anyone who has ever worked for a powerful company, especially overseas, knows he or she is at the mercy, if you will, of the man or men in charge. And up till recently, those in charge were always men.  Spouses played supporting roles.  But just because there is the possibility that the  men who were rescued by the team that Ross Perot put together  might have gotten out anyway--and, especially after reading this book, I would never assume that--is not to say the rescuers were not heroic.  Perot himself deserves praise for sticking by his employees, at substantial personal cost.    In 1978 Iran was in a violent state of revolution.  Americans at that time were particularly detested by the Iranian populace, who associated them with the hated strong man, the Shah.  The Shah was deposed and Americans wanted to leave Iran and then soon realized  they  HAD  to leave Iran.  For some reason two employees of ELS, Ross Perot's data processing company, were imprisoned by an Iranian official named Dadgar. Perhaps Dadgar thought that one of the men, William Gaylord, was the chief of the Iranian operation, William Gayden, and it was a case of mistaken identity. The prisoners were not formally charged. Once they   escaped, they made their way to the hotel where some of the rescue team were staying.  Perot had put together, under the impressive leadership of  former Green Beret Colonel Arthur (\\"Bull\\") Simons, a  formidable group.      From then on during  their journey out, ultimately via a remote road in northwestern Iran,  the situation was even more hazardous and often terrifying. Another team of employees met them across the border.  These second-team men had also undergone discomfort and difficulties just to get to the frontier from the Turkish side and to prepare their part of the rescue.    Even with the whole country in turmoil, Dadgar's people pursued the two men relentlessly, like a latter-day Javert.  It seems a strange, and oddly personal, vendetta.  The government under the Shah had hired Perot's  data service company  EDS to  set up a base so the country could have socialized medicine, but that year the government apparently ran out of money and ceased to make payments.  EDS finally demanded the tardy sum and refused to do any more till they got it. That's  when the trouble accelerated.  Dadgar alleged or at least implied that EDS had been dishonest. Almost at random, it seemed, Dadgar tossed  the two EDS employees in prison, and they became the focus of the Iranian's rage with the firm.    One of their biggest problems the rescuers had was the hostile terrain in the primitive mountainous area they had to cross. Another was the anarchy of the tribal people they encountered.  Each tribe answered to its own head man and it seemed there was no guaranteed safe-conduct no matter who they got to sign their documents. The Americans did skirt the law but the book states they tried to keep this at a bare minimum.      Their story as told in the book is a bit longer than it needs to be and under a lesser writer might become tedious, but in fact it is riveting all the way.  The wives and families seemed to be incredibly stoic, even when they did not know exactly what was going on. It might have been more natural to see them fall apart occasionally and at least one couple eventually divorced. The  women, as much as their husbands, deserve honour and respect.  It's hard to explain, but even though this happened thirty years ago, the wives seem anachronistic, perhaps because they are defined through masculine prisms.    Finally, at the very end of the book, Follett tells us that more Americanhostages were taken in Teheran in November, 1979 but he chooses--or Perot chooses--not to mention the six American hostages who made their way to the Canadian embassy and hid inside the homes of the ambassador and immigration officer John Sheardown.  The courageous Canadian ambassador, Kenneth Taylor, with the cooperation of the Canadian politicians of the day to whom he answered, issued these hostages false Canadian passports so they could escape their siege in Iran. True, they did not have to break the law--at least not Canadian law-- because a special act of Parliament was passed in the first secret session since World War II, in order to issue these documents.  At that point they were assisted in this endeavour by the CIA.      Theirs is still a hair-raising adventure.  Without taking away from the bravery and panache of Perot's men,  we wonder what Ken Follett's brilliant pen would have made of this event, dubbed \\"the Canadian caper,\\"  which called for a different   kind of courage, but one that was just as real.    The doughty and indomitable businessman Ross Perot generously went through a great deal of his own time and money to save these men.  Likewise, Ambassador Taylor might have been forced to sacrifice his own career.  Both men put everything on the line.  There was every possibility that things could have ended disastrously in each case,but both men were not afraid to take a chance.
0307266303|5.0|Not only is this a worthwhile adventure into running BORN TO RUN reflects a knowledge of and consideration for the culture and traditions of the Tarahumara (Raramuri) people of the Copper Canyon (Las Barrancas de Cobre) within the state of Chihuahua, Mexico.  Some of the most isolated people of the Americas, the RARAMURI are depicted in a knowledgeable and comprehensible manner by author Chrisopher McDougall.  I thouroughly enjoyed the myriad adventures in ultra running events i.e. the Leadville 100.  But the many references to Las Barrancas and the Raramuri truly made the book more than just a mere adventure in running.  Enjoy!
031606792X|1.0|As many other reviewers, I have read the previous books in the Twilight sage and couldn't get enough. But as I read through the final book (Breaking Dawn), I felt like a 5 yr. old in Disney Land that just witnessed Mickey Mouse taking it's costume head off. It is one of the worst Saga finale ever. The book drags on over 700 pages of redundant story lines and disappointing turn of events. What was so great and exciting in the previous books, turned into poor and silly plots. One of those disappointments is the love triangle between Bella, Edward and Jacob turning into an imprinted love story between the baby daughter of Bella's and Jake. How revolting. Not to mention that even as a vampire Bella is still that insecure little girl that can't take her eyes of Edward and his beauty. I would have hoped that with the venom, she would have gotten some personality.<br /><br />I'm so disenchanted with the story line that I wouldn't even consider reading anything else from the Twilight Saga, should Stephenie Meyer consider writing more in the future.<br /><br />I hope at least that Hollywood can change the story line and maybe pick up more of the unfinished story lines from the previous books and implement it into the movies.

Conspicuously absent from a completist's perspective though are the band's earliest demos, particularly the ON A FRIDAY demo and the MANIC HEDGEHOG demo. Still, it's fun to hear the band's earliest tracks, particularly cornballers like \\"Pop Is Dead.\\" Just makes you scratch your head even more that this is Radiohead. Highlights are \\"Stupid Car\\", the punked up version of \\"Thinking About You\\", \\"Million Dollar Question,\\" the gorgeous US version of \\"Stop Whispering\\" (sounds like something from the Cranberries' debut), and the live version of \\"Nothing Touches Me.\\" I probably wouldn't bother buying this reissue, but the 4's and the 5's are worth buying the mp3's for fans.<br /><br />Completion: 6/10<br />Compilation: 8/10<br /><br />Tracks:<br /><br />1.

B001U891HE|5.0|What man or woman among you could find fault with forty Shakespeare plays + his sonnets for just over a quid in a highly portable format. Amazing! The Table of Contents is great. You can use it to go to the start of any play or act within the play. I used the \\"Search this Book\\" function in the menu to track down a couple of famous speeches by typing in \\"Band of Brothers\\" and \\"Slings and Arrows\\" (after getting over 100 hits when I typed in \\"To be or not to be\\"). In each case I was taken right to Harry and Hamlet respectively. As the product description advises, the book opens to the first line of the first play and you have to either click menu and \\"go to beginning or the book\\" or hit the \\"previous page\\" button a number of times to get to the start of the index. Methinks it most cooly presents the bard's great output. Address thy gate, gentle reader, to the purchase button.

031606792X|5.0|Though, clearly, many aspects were predicable, the book did a nice job of wrapping up loose ends in a dramatic manner, with a few extra scandals added in. This was the first book in the series I was able to read in 2 sittings (as opposed to 1) but this may just be because I had recently finished Eclipse and was still desperately short on sleep. Good Book, Good Series. I'm happy I bought them, because they all deserve a re-read.

B002F3BP8Q|4.0|Indeed, ever since the massive \\"garage sale\\" that was 2000's \\"Rare Cult\\" boxset that very much cleaned all the shelves from unreleased and/or hard to find material, Beggars Banquet had been sitting on this one. Bearing in mind that the boxset was a limited edition release, it would only have been fitting for the company to re-release all of the band's albums in expanded format with a second CD of extra goodies. But nooo, instead, Beggars decided to wait until a more \\"marketable\\" opportunity arose, and so it did, only 9 years later, just as Ian Astbury announces that \\"There will be no new album. I don't think we'll ever see a Cult album. Albums are dead.\\" (his words, not mine, look it up on the internet if you don't trust me...) and that the band will launch a tour where they will showcase the \\"Love\\" album from start to finish live for the first time ever.<br /><br />And thus we get \\"Love Expanded Edition\\". So obviously, as a consumer and record buyer I'm not too crazy about the opportunistic, blood sucking move from Beggars, but as a Cult diehard, this is a total treat and I can't help but salivate and drool all over it! It comes down to this: if you, like me, are a Cult fan who couldn't get a hold of the boxset, this is a must, period. You need to get this now.<br /><br />In my humble opinion, \\"Love\\" is THE quintessential Cult album. If I were ever forced to choose one and only one album from The Cult to include in my solar powered coconut MP3 player in a desert island, this would be it. Sure, they went on to become rich and famous with other releases (namely \\"Electric\\" and \\"Sonic Temple\\"), but this, my friends, is The Cult at their most unique and their most inspired. In the midst of the 80's music scene, dominated by hair metal, synth-pop and new wave, no other band sounded like The Cult, who boldly spat on the face of the music biz and made exactly the album they wanted to make.<br /><br />A perfect collusion of neo-hippy sensibility, Zeppelinesque guitar riffery and punk attitude, \\"Love\\" was \\"alternative rock\\" before it was cool to be alternative and remains a true masterpiece 24 odd years later. Songs such as \\"Rain\\" (one of my all time favorite songs!), \\"Hollow Man\\", \\"Big Neon Glitter\\" or \\"Nirvana\\", while retaining faint hints of their post-punk/goth roots, resonate with a power and confidence that's awe-inspiring. The core of the band at the time, formed by singer Ian Astbury, guitarist Billy Duffy, bassist Jamie Stewart shine throughout as a true unit, perfectly complemented for this recording by session drummer Mark Brzezicki who replaced original drummer Nigel Preston after the recording and release of the single \\"She Sells Sanctuary\\". And while this feels like a group effort through and through, especial praise must go to producer Steve Brown and to Billy for  creating such a shimmering, powerful and kicking wall of guitars.<br /><br />Other songs, such as \\"Love\\", \\"The Phoenix\\" already point at heavier things to come from a band that refused to stagnate and repeat itself. And of course, \\"She Sells Sanctuary\\", their first big hit, remains as vital today as it did back then, its eastern-flavored riff perfectly setting the tone of the album as a whole. The album never lacks intensity, even during the softer/slower numbers, and every song is a classic, including the haunting \\"Brother Wolf, Sister Moon\\", the contradictorily titled \\"Revolution\\" (with such a title, wouldn't you be expecting a total blast in face? and yet...) and the dark and beautiful \\"Black Angel\\". Not a weak link to be found here, and the clarity of the sound of the original album is only enhanced by this release.<br /><br />Disc 2 of this release is filled with b-sides and remixes. Most were used as single b-sides, and unless I'm mistaken, they were all included on the boxset. This is a great opportunity to get all of this in one convenient package, especially since some of this material is absolutely gorgeous: songs such as \\"Judith\\", \\"Sunrise\\" and \\"AllSouls Avenue\\" were all worthy on inclusion on the album, but they had to be sacrificed at the time due to time constraints. I'm not a particularly big fan of remixes, especially of remixes of my favorite tunes, and the \\"Here Comes the Rain\\" remix is a good example of why: while the song is too good to be ruined by a remix, I'm not particularly fond of this extended version. That being said, some of the other remixes are interesting enough to warrant the purchase of this release.<br /><br />Only one more question remains: will Beggars continue this trend and re-release all of the band's albums in expanded format? They certainly could, since there is no shortage of additional material to make such releases and it is readily available in light of the work done for the boxset. But will they? I would definitely go for expanded editions of \\"Dreamtime\\" (including the extra songs \\"Resurrection Joe\\" and \\"Bonebag\\", in addition to the ultra rare \\"Dreamtime Live at the Lyceum\\"), \\"Electric\\" (including the entire \\"Peace\\" album), \\"Sonic Temple\\", \\"Ceremony\\" and \\"Black Sheep\\" (all of which had tons of outtakes, remixes, demos and so forth), but I'm not sure the company will do that. Perhaps they'll just wait until the band decides to showcase each of those albums live in order to cash in...? or maybe, just maybe, they are testing the waters with this release before going any further? Oh well, I guess we'll see...<br /><br />Anyway, the bottom line: this is a 5 star CD (I just took a star off as a protest at Beggars' opportunism), and if you're a Cult-head (such as myself), you have to have this, and if you didn't buy the boxset back in 2000, even more so. If you are more of a casual fan, this might be a little too \\"complete\\" and a little too much for you, but I honestly believe that you'd enjoy it a great deal if you give it a shot. And finally, for the uninitiated, this is THE ALBUM: if you have to buy one and only one album by this band, let \\"Love\\" be the one. It is a timeless testament to Billy's, Ian's and Jamie's talents. This is The Cult at their most unique, and no rock fan should do without this album. And if you definitely, absolutely, most assuredly have to have it all, then wait a bit longer and save a bit more and purchase the 4CD, \\"Omnibus\\" edition coming out on September 2009. Peace!sion on the album, but they had to be sacrificed at the time due to time constraints.

B001EYGOEM|4.0|Taylor Swift has had quite a successful career so far for a 20 year old.<br /><br />In November 2008, Swift followed up her triple platinum debut album with this sophomore album, \\"Fearless\\".  Swift is the only female country artist to achieve five Top 10 singles from a debut album!  She is also the only female vocalist in the past ten years to reach the Top 5 on Billboard's Hot 100 chart and, according to Nielsen Soundscan, she was the biggest selling artist of 2008, clearing four million album sales.  Also, according to Soundscan, she is the first artist in the history of Soundscan to have two different albums in the Top 10 at year's end.<br /><br />What makes Swift so enjoyable is that she is versatile.  She is young enough to cater to the Disney, Hannah Montana-loving demographic, but sweet enough and with solid enough country lyrics for parents to listen along as well without having to hide it as a guilty pleasure.  Sure, Swift sings about school and being young.  She is young.  It's expected.  But she also carries with her such a deep sense of understanding of relationships, about heartbreak and letting go, about fear and falling in love, that we can all relate to and understand how she feels while being transported back to that one memory where we can see ourselves in her words.<br /><br />If you have been considering giving her a try but were worried about it being pure Disney fluff, you can rest those notions.  Not only can you find versions of her songs where she isn't as G-rated, but Swift is a force to be reckoned with in the country music industry.  The crispness of her instrumental accompaniment is a breath of fresh air and her voice and content will give you chills.<br /><br />Swift has been criticized for \\"not being able to hold three notes in a row\\" by Entertainment Weekly.  She is still young yet and this is only her second album.  There's plenty of room for improvement as the years progress but if she even needs anything at all, it's some light fine tuning.  She is great enough as she is right now.  At the very least, in today's music business, she deserves praise for being able to write and sing her own material.<br /><br />Below is a brief description and numeric rating of the tracks on \\"Fearless\\".<br /><br />Fearless<br /><br />1) Fearless--(8)--a solid opening track about losing all inhibitions while falling in love.<br /><br />2) Fifteen--(8)--Swift likes to touch on her own experiences while songwriting and if you're not of the age to live out her words here, you can certainly relate to the moments.  Swift sings about \\"if I only knew then what I know now\\" in regards to high school and \\"falling in love\\" at fifteen years old, including her best friend, Abigail's, experiences here as well.<br /><br />3) Love Story--(8)--this song has had a long life on radio so far.  A tale of young love unfolds in the style of Romeo and Juliet, (without all the death), and despite parental concern, has a happy ending.<br /><br />4) Hey Stephen--(8)--supposedly written for singer/songwriter Stephen Barker Liles who opened with his band Love & Theft for Swift's tour.  Swift expresses her unrequited love for \\"Stephen\\" and although tons of girls are throwing rocks out his window, \\"would they write a song for you?\\"<br /><br />5) White Horse--(7)--a song of love gone wrong that unravels fairytales and movies that paint love as an intensely romantic scene of princesses and white horses and brings it back down to the small town where reality sets in that this relationship is not going to work out.<br /><br />6) You Belong With Me--(9)--her most recent single, this adorable tune is about a girl being in love with the boy in school who is with the pretty, popular cheer captain and doesn't notice his true fan, just as pretty, lurking on the bleachers in sneakers.<br /><br />7) Breathe--(7)--a song about a long-time love that has come to an end and trying to learn who you are again without that person by your side.<br /><br />8) TellMe Why--(6)--expressing her anger towards someone who is treating her badly, you wonder why Swift is bothering to continue to deal with someone who is such an angry put-down.<br /><br />9) You're Not Sorry--(7)--Swift is finally washing her hands of someone who has hurt her many times.  She won't accept his apology because he doesn't truly mean it anyway.  He may look innocent, but she knows him well enough to know differently.<br /><br />10) The Way I Loved You--(6) --the relationship has reached that point where the love has matured and they are left with calm, sweet love that everyone is jealous of, but Swift misses the passion that started it all in the first place, the passion that made her fall in love with him.<br /><br />11) Forever and Always--(6)--he said he loved her so why isn't he calling?

B00284BMBM|5.0|As an older listener (55) I love this album. I loved the 1st one and this lived up to all expectations.  My daughters (29 & 26) also love this album which is why I'm delighted I bought three copies, one each. My soon to be son-in-law (27) also thinks this is a fantastic album. This has to be good coming from four people having different tastes in music but all agreeing that Daughtry is JUST BRILLIANT.
B001TKMAGW|5.0|[[VIDEOID:37640921]]Check out the video below where I talk about the release. I show you a complete unboxing, showing everything that is inside there, speak to the sound quality, the extras on the second CD, etc, etc... The real review is in the video, not in this text. :)<br /><br />Minor updates to my review. The book I mention towards the end is not Mark Weiss, he was the photographer, I believe. And the poem from the original release *IS* here, but not the upside down cross. That was my error.
0375842209|5.0|The Book Thief was absolutely brilliant. The language is simple but the story radiates pure emotion. This is a book I advise you to not read in public because it will take away from the experience. I spent several minutes captivated by the words and plot of the story. It is the single best book I have ever read.
0765356139|3.0|I liked this book, but it took patience to complete.  It was necessary to move and develop the story but it mostly lost momentum because it sets plot for the third book.  The real fun is when everything converges in the third book, and and you get to reflect and appreciate all the work and detail that went into the first two books.  It is worth reading because it will all make sense by the end of the story. The trilogy keeps you thinking about it after reading it, and the more I thought about it, the more I liked it.  If you can finish this book you will be in for a treat when you get to the third and final book.
0930289234|5.0|There is a reason this graphic novel was on the NY Times best seller BOOK list.  It is one of the finest works of fiction in modern history.<br />Alan Moore has penned a lot of great comics, but this is probably his best.

B000VMFDW2|5.0|Without a doubt, this is the most engaging war memoir that I have ever read.<br /><br />Sledge has no literary pretension nor ambition of any kind, so what he creates is something akin to Remarque's inimitable All Quiet on the Western Front.<br /><br />With the Old Breed reads like a novel because of the brutal honesty with which the narrator, Sledge himself, relates his experiences from a profound Humanism--a genuine, and not inchoate, Humanism. This is direct story-telling: in first person and terrifyingly candid, untarnished, nor emended by the passing of time. (The book was first published in 1981.)<br /><br />A young man, who climbs out of \\"the Abyss\\", to use Sledge's description of the Peleiu and Okinawa campaigns, survives with his humanism intact if not generated to greater empathy.<br /><br />Read this.
1594202249|5.0|I've read all the Pynchon novels except Mason & Dixon and I have to say that this is one of \\"easier\\" novels. By that I mean that it has a more followable plot than most and doesn't get too bogged down in esoteric side-trips. The ending was a bit disappointing, though - like the entire book is a sort of practical joke on the reader and his fans.    This book is very funny and I found myself laughing out loud many times while reading it. The main character (Doc) is a 1970 hard-boiled hippie detective that has more in common with The Dude (from The Big Lebowski) than most of the other detectives in the genre (and I noticed several allusions to that movie - one of my favorites - throughout the book).      The plot is the usual Pynchon concoction of various levels of paranoia and shadowy behind the scenes overlords. The character names are toned down a bit compared to his other novels but the humor dial is turned to eleven.      So - if you've always wanted to read Pynchon and feel intimidated by Gravity's Rainbow then try this one. It is a hoot, really.
B0015ABRE2|3.0|I have nothing but great things to say about this show. I've loved it since Season 1 and will continue to be an avid fan. HOWEVER, I was just given the box set yesterday when it was released. I hoped, for the first time, that the Producers (now including the major star of the show Michael C. Hall), would have some thoughful bonuses for fans who pay for showtime and then purchse the shows on DVD. I was really hoping the get a director's commentary, interviews and maybe even a gag real (as they must have a blast on the set, right?). Nothing. When I put the DVD in my computer and pulled up the Bonus Content, I was brought to a page that said, \\"Bonus content for Dexter coming soon...\\". GRRRRRRH
B000002KDO|5.0|With two albums under their belts, Black Sabbath evolved from a good local act to stunning band and was staring to get some recognition after Paranoid. Their third album Master of Reality was to be released in 1971, and to this day it's still one of my favourite albums and one of Sabbath's greatest. The first self-titled album was a strong bluesy, really dark and heavier than anything else out there, then they got known with Paranoid which is considered one of the best and most influential album of all-time. But in my opinion if there's one album that you can get tired of hearing of all that Sabbath has done, it has to be Paranoid. I like Master of Reality better, the songs are just better to me and it's something you don't always hear on classic rock radio like Paranoid or Iron Man. Besides I think the album represents the band at best, as lords of doom.<br /><br /> Master starts out with the epic opening of Sweet Leaf,  with Tony Iommi choking on a joint(it's truly how it begins) and the songs just kicks in with the nice slow riff, it truly is one of Sabbath's best songs. I will also mention it was written about Ozzy's favourite leaf (I guess you know which one). After Forever is one of the best things the band did, if you read the lyrics more closely you'll see that its Sabbath saying they believe in god! It might sound weird with Sabbath's reputation at the time, but they wanted to get the satanic thing behind them at the time. \\"Would you like to see the pope on the end of the rope? Do you think he's a fool? Well I've seen the truth and I've changed my ways\\" just great lyrical stuff. Then Embryo follows which is a nice and different, 28 seconds acoustic song, it's a great introduction to another classic, Children of the Grave. Another favourite, Tony's chug-a-chug riff, Ozzy's vocals, Geezer's bass playing and Bill's drumming altogether make this song [pretty fast considering the time and make the song special.<br /><br />Orchid is a more complete instrumental; it lasts longer than Embryo and sounds better with gentle acoustic guitar. Lord of this World is a slow rocker like Sweet Leaf, just another great song, and much like the rest of the album really dark. The ending is fantastic with the song getting faster with a great drum beat and another amazing solo. Solitude follows; it's a slower more emotional song. I feel the song is beautiful, it seems weird but I think it's truly a unique song and something very different and well done for Black Sabbath, plus the guitar work is amazing, not much of a riff, just melody. It's not a song they played live often (if they ever did), but I appreciate it and like to hear this from one of my favourite band. The name fits the song really well as it pretty much describes the whole song in one word. Into The Void is the epic here, at 6:11 it's the longest song on the album.It'another excellent song not much to say except it's highpoint.<br /><br />Master is one of my favourite Sabbath albums because it's just everything the band is; it's dark, heavy, and it's edgy. It's really a masterpiece and a classic album. The fact that it's got so many classic and that all the songs are great and unique combined with the musical abilities of the individuals who perform it just make that good, that timeless. Black Sabbath left their mark in music and this is one of their best albums, a must have for any rock n'roll(heavy metal or whatever you call it) fan or Sabbath fan.5 stars all the way.longer than Embryo and sounds better with gentle acoustic guitar.

She disappears suddenly once day and Michael next sees her when he's a law student in 1965 Germany as the war trials of the Nazi criminals are getting underway.<br /><br />He is both stunned and repulsed when seeing his former paramour as an SS guard criminal.

044024367X|1.0|Twelve Reacher novels: I've read them all. But had this been the first I'd have stopped at one.     The plot is ludicrous; the characterisation thin.

B00099BPP6|5.0|This \\"German\\" Rigoletto may not please Italians or italianate aficionados, but it has so many good things at a low price, that it turns in a real must for everyone. Maybe Fisher-Dieskau phrasing is too hard for italian, but oh boy, how does he SING!. Yes, with capital letters. The father-daughter duos are simply magical here, and FD is their main driver. Bergonzi may seem another wrong casting decision, mainly because he lacks the role's required full chest high notes, that Pavarotti or Kraus or Bonisolli have. But, again, the guy SINGS so well, he does a musical, elegant Duke in his own marvelous way. Scotto is very good, perhaps a little below her previous 1959 recording with Gavazzeni, though here we have a better 1964 sound. And sound quality plus conducting maybe the main strength in this set: Kubelik is simply magnificent. He makes La Scala forces sound better than ever, including later much praised recordings, like those of Claudio Abbado. This CD also sounds much better than the 1980 over praised Rigoletto by Giulini. Don't miss this real bargain.
1594202249|5.0|Those who enjoy the great Raymond Chandler will find lots to like in INHERENT VICE, where many scenes seem to allude to FAREWELL MY LOVELY, THE LONG GOODBYE, and THE LITTLE SISTER. These readers will also find that Pynchon has retained much of Ray's ambience in VICE, with the mean streets of 1940-ish LA not so different from Pynchon's paranoid late-sixties LaLaLand, just after Charlie Mason has murdered. These readers will also find in both worlds a lonely PI fighting back against intrigue and dishonest cops, while some shadowy ruthless presence pulls the strings.<br /><br />At the same time, Pynchon has given the detective genre his own twist in VICE. Chandler's deadly and insidious dames have become flighty and sexually liberated hippie chicks. His assortment of tough cops has become the likable but manipulative Bigfoot Bjornsen, who has a hilarious aversion to hippies. Finally, Chandler's principled but burned out Philip Marlowe has become Doc Sportello, a doper PI who, like Marlowe, works on spec and tries to do the right thing. Here, both Phil and Doc overindulge. But Marlowe's sour boozer's outlook has become Doc's pot-brain, where he's not sure what he just said, or if he said anything at all.<br /><br />When they work in the detective genre, accomplished writers often highlight what is already known about their work. In NIGHT TRAIN, Amis's terse and poetic prose, as well as the essential loneliness of his characters, became even more apparent. Likewise, THE YIDDISH POLICEMEN'S UNION showcased Chabon's gentle sympathy for all his characters and his wonderful metaphors.<br /><br />So, what does the Pynch show in VICE? As usual with Pynchon, there are the little things--the silly songs, the funny names, and the cartoonish characters, who enable the zany or magical connections or incidents in his plots. And, there is the subject of paranoia, which is, of course, not technically paranoia in Pynchon's world, since something is going on. But in Pynchon novels, there is also, sometimes, a character who, beneath the science and the overlap of multiple narratives, is trying to restore a shattered family. In VICE, this is Coy Harlingen, who is trapped on a dark journey. Ultimately, Coy, in a small way, redeems the book.<br /><br />Highly recommended.s, a character who, beneath the science and the overlap of multiple narratives, is trying to restore a shattered family.

B0028MBKVG|4.0|As a non-runner, I was somewhat hopeful, based upon the other reviews, that this book would motivate me to hop out of bed and hit the street with a jaunty stride each morning.  Although this book contains interesting and cutting edge information on the nefarious Running Shoe Industry and evolutionary biology that is certainly worth the price, I was a little disappointed with the disjointed, flashback narrative and the introduction of numerous characters that I had trouble keeping straight by the end of the book.  If you are a serious runner, you will love this book (as evidenced by all the 5 Star reviews).  If you are looking for motivation to get out and run a marathon, look for a self-improvement book like: \\"One Small Step Can Change Your Life: The Kaizen Way,\\" by Robert Maurer.
0307588335|5.0|Listen to me, not many are fortunate to work on Wall street, and because of that reason, I am extremely happy when I read this book. It kept my interest from the first page to the last. It played out a dramatic movie like for instance 12 Angry Men, you are wondering what the verdict is going to be. Even though we know the ending of Lehman Brothers, it was a great ride of a read getting there. I am the glad the author DID NOT go into weeds with acronyms such as CDO, CLO, RMBS, CMBS. Not being a financial insider I would not understand anyway, and that would make this book a total turnoff being a primer for wall street insiders. There was enough explanation of the acronyms, that did not turn me off course about getting to the end. It is very sad about the end, beacause as the author said on the last page, it did not have to happen. How one man Richard Fuld and few close sycophants completely destroyed this venerable institution is forever unbelievable. The author made me feel like I was on the inside riding the ups and downs with those who were on the front lines. When Larry, Mike and Alex quit I felt sadness for them. The author Mr Mcdonald, has done a great job in describing in colorful detail what it felt like on the inside, with clear insight on the \\"management\\" team and those who work side by side in the trenches. I put management in quotes, because they who were in charge did act like a proper management team, and the author certainly lets you know who the villains are make no mistake about that. To sum up this is a tremendous book,  I promise you will not be disappointed.

In any event I've heard it has gotten rave reviews and I can understand why!  It is great!  I then went ahead and rented and viewed episode 2 as well.  The same result.  Now I'm addicted.  I may have to buy the first two seasons on DVD.
B0009MAP90|5.0|Whenever I listen to this disc, it always comes as a pleasant surprise.  As a loyal fan and follower of Bob Dylan's for over 40 years, I know him primarily through his own compositions to be a tremendous song-writer.  Because his voice can take some getting used to, it is easy to overlook the fact that Dylan is a remarkably powerful interpreter of his own songs and of the songs of others.  On this, his first album, Dylan's set list is comprised almost entirely of staple items from the folk-catalogue, and he interprets each and every one with subtlety and power.  If you enjoy Dylan as a singer-songwriter, you owe it to yourself to explore this early work in which he performs selections from the popular folks-song catalogue.  And if you do enjoy this disc, you may also want to consider two later albums, \\"Good as I Been To You\\" and \\"World Gone Wrong\\" in which an older, more ragged-voiced Dylan, returns to his folk roots.

All of the cuts on this album are just plain beautiful music.  How the music critics can pan this album and treat Desert Rose like unalloyed gold is beyond me.  This album is far better.  Don't get me wrong, Desert Rose is fun, but only has one memorable song on it.  You will find yourself hitting the replay button over and over again for Mercury Rising.  Critics are idiots!  Do something different and they are so stumped they can't figure it out.

Other songs to commment about are: \\"Swamp Song\\", \\"Undertow\\", and \\"Disgustipated\\". This was underrated, and dismissed rather quickly. I feel it's time to reintroduce this to the radio.

The artwork was nice and there were a ew new monsters, but nothing of use for placing the monster in a dungeon or anywhere else in a game unless I was using the miniatures and maps.

It's about a murder in Alaska that the locals can't seem to solve, and they bring in a legendary police officer from Los Angeles played equally good by Al Pacino. However, Pacino's character isn't quite ready for the wilds of Alaska...especially during the summer when the sun never sets, and lack of sleep is an understatement. Then there comes the chase in the fog where Pacino accidently shoots his partner....or does he? There's alot more riding on this than the murder mystery itself, and it plays out where Williams and Pacino play the game of cat and mouse. Apparently Williams had done some research into Pacino's past, and he promises to keep quiet if Pacino keeps quiet about Williams little murder. There's a underlying twist here, and Pacino's admirer played by Hillary Swank comes to the same conclusion, and just in time when Pacino decides he doesn't want to keep quiet anymore, and then comes the fight scenes between Williams and Pacino, and brother let me tell you it was one that has stuck in my mind for the last 7 years. In the end however, it was hard to tell if justice was served as both Pacino and Williams characters end up dying by the others hand. I feel that this was one of the overlooked movies of 2002, and so I want to put this here to remind people that Robin Williams can act in suspense/thrillers too. He's funny, but don't judge this, or \\"One Hour Photo\\", or for that matter \\"The Final Cut\\" before giving it a chance. He did good in all 3 movies.
031606792X|2.0|Eclipse was alright - it was certainly dry through the middle but it ended strong and made me very anticipated for Breaking Dawn.    The start of Breaking Dawn kept my attention.  I kept wanting to know more and it kept me on the edge most of the way through until somewhere at about page 550 after Charlie came over to see Bella at the Cullen's house -- and even after that I was anticipating more from Charlie.  Then the last 200 pages dragged and dragged.  There was so much build up, but nothing delivered.  Instead you just have this huge group of vampires and werewolves all grouped together for a battle but nothing ever happens.  No battle. No deaths of an important character that we all care about - and what sucks is that before I even got to the end, I knew nothing was going to happen... I just knew it.  It's becomes easy to guess when throughout the series Bella is constantly thinking \\"I'm going to die\\" but it never happens - and you know it can't because she's the main character.  But still, Meyer could've had someone main character die.  Because of this, I found myself not even influenced to finish it.  Eventually I did, with great disappointment.    Come on Stephenie Meyer, you only had four books in the series so you could've at least let it end strong.  You should've gave something to put tears in our eyes or make us sit at the edge of our seats.    Also, she needs to hire a new editor - or if not just that, come up with more verbs, adverbs, and adjectives to use.  It got real dull to be constantly reading over and over how someone \\"pursed\\" their lips or made \\"fists\\" of anger.  Physical descriptions of characters would be nice throughout the series too.  I never really knew what several of the characters introduced in Twilight looked like until I read the rest of the series - and some, I still don't know what they are supposed to look like.
B001PA0FFO|4.0|Having never seen the play, I can't compare the film with it, but with Meryl Streep & Philip Seymour Hoffman in the lead roles, the movie already attains a certain standard.  Meryl Streep is incredible in this film as the pale & rigid nun.  I love the way she is able to change her appearance dramatically without special effects, just with a little make up, her expressions, & the aura she gives off playing a character.  Philip Seymour Hoffman is effective here also as the popular, progressive priest.  The supporting characters were strong, notably Amy Adams as the younger, more impressionable nun & Viola Davis as the boy's mom.    The story takes place well before the child molestation scandals of Catholic priests, & we're watching the film after the scandals blew out in the open, so given that context, for me, there was almost no doubt as to what happened.  I enjoyed the movie but would have even enjoyed it more if I really did feel the doubt.

B000001FHV|4.0|I heard some Meat Puppets on WPRB in Princeton University, but it wasn't anything like this. I originally thought they were from Philadelphia, but according to Rock 100 WDIZ they are from Phoenix, AZ. Anyway this is a good album I'm glad I gave it a chance. I was tired of hearing \\"Backwater\\" which was the big hit down here in Florida. I enjoyed hearing \\"Violet Eyes\\", and \\"Hole In The Roof\\" just to name a few. It does sound like they went grunge with this album, so I can certainly understand why people feel like they sold out with this, but let's face it bands walk a thin line between staying true to their roots, and wanting to succeed. I can only say that with the Meat Puppets they wanted to branch out as there's a cross between grunge, and alternative here. I know with some of the Meat Puppets could sound like hardcore punk, and others almost new wave. They are just versatile, so give them a break. I know sampling \\"Backwater\\" I'm still tired of it, but the album is still good.
B0013V33DG|5.0|I just viewed my new purchase of \\"La Fille du Régiment.\\" Every singer was superb in this performance. Just to listen to Flórez sing the nine high Cs in \\"Ah! mes amis,\\" was a delight. It was pure perfection, and what a voice! One thing that surprised me was the DVD that I received from Amazon had a format of 16:9, not 1.33:1 as it was described at Amazon. If I had known that I would have bought it a long time ago. Along with \\"La Fille\\" I also bought the Met performance of \\"La Bohème.\\" It was also an amazing performance with all the magnificent staging that the Metropolitan is famous for. The DVD also included the back stage activity that went on during the intermission. Quite interesting to watch. These 2 operas are quite stunning. I recommend them.
B000A7X6U4|2.0|The album is sterile, cold, dull, repetitive electronica, with a passionless vocal track.  If that's what you like, you'll like this. It doesn't do anything for me. It doesn't repel me (like rap), but provides nothing of interest for future listening.
B000009HF2|5.0|I used to have this album. I bought it when I was 21, and wanting to know what all the rage was about this album. After I heard \\"Somthing's Happening\\" I knew why. Up until this point there has never been a song that kicked off a concert in such a fashion, and there probably will never be. The man came to this arena to do one thing, and that's ROCK!!!!! He played \\"Something's Happening\\" like he wanted everyone to know who he was, and that every girl/woman would go home, and dream about him after the concert. It was like he was living his last night on Earth, and he wanted to go out with a bang. I could just go on and on about this because it's the best send off of a live album; I remember my first concert I went to which was a KISS concert on May 4, 1992 at the Trocodero in Philly. KISS led off with \\"Love Gun\\" while it was good it just doesn't rank up there with \\"Something's Happening\\". Don't think I just got hung up on the one song there's much more as he got funky with \\"Doobie Wah\\", and then rocked on with \\"Show Me The Way\\". The songs 4-9 he got acoustic, but showed off his versatility with the piano, and acoustic guitar, and then went back to rocking with \\"I'll Send You Some Money\\", and \\"Shine On\\". The album's weakest point was his cover of the Stones song \\"Jumping Jack Flash\\", but he makes up for it with \\"Lines On My Face\\", and the closer with \\"Do You Feel Like We Do?\\" which is the best way to close out a concert. How this never made it to number 1 I'll never know. I know I heard his follow up with \\"I'm In You\\" the song only, and that was a whimper compared to this. I'll check out the rest of \\"I'm In You\\" eventually, but in the meantime I had to share my feelings about this album. I will probably buy the cd of this sometime.
B00001U0E1|5.0|After watching this movie on regular tv with all the cuts, I realized it was one movie I would watch over and over - uncut! Great lines, great twist on Will Shakespeare, Judy Dench slays with 10 mins of screen time. Treat yourself to it!
B001N18HOQ|3.0|To be treated with a re-release of Ten which of coarse is not as good as the origional which is also packaged in here (thank god) then to have an album like Backspacer on the horizion is strange.  Hearing TEN then listening to Backspacer are like listening to two totally different bands.  The Pearl Jam performing TEN is good the Pearl Jam on Backspacer sucks and sounds like radio freiendly dated garbage.  But overall it's a good package, the origional mix is much better than the new one and the DVD is decent.  This is the only Pearl Jam album worth buying.
B00288KNLS|4.0|So I saw it at the theater in 3D - loved it but... Be warned that the 3D dvd is red/blue and comes with the old fashion paper glasses. This was not how it was shown at the theaters. Still a great movie and luckily the 3D dvd has the movie in non-3d.

B001R3YRG2|5.0|Way under rated film about the 'I want it yesterday' America of the '90's. Michael Douglas is superb as Bill Foster, whose world, and psyche suddenly crumbles one day in a L.A. traffic jam. He takes us on his own, \\"Heart Of Darkness\\" journey as he reacts to situations as he sees fit. Heartbreaking conclusion leaves us with two questions Bill Foster incredulously asks: \\"I'm the bad guy!? How did I get to be the bad guy?\\"<br /><br />There's a Bill Foster in all of us. We are fortunate enough (so far) to keep him secure...
B0000DYJM6|5.0|A good collection of rare songs that they sometimes still play live.
1603580557|4.0|I enjoyed this book and it was very informative, but it was very dry. It was different from a lot of reading that I do for fun in how dry it was. If I were reading this for fun, I'd recommend skimming the book or only reading the beginning. The different perspective from other kinds of modeling was what was particularly nice & rewarding about this book.
B0000027RL|5.0|This was Pearl Jam's stellar debut which turned out to be one of the best albums of the 90's and one of the first albums I had the pleasure of enjoying.  All the songs are wonderful, well crafted, meaningful and rock.  Great debut album from the saviours of rock music. \m/
B001W63DX2|5.0|Having had the privilege of seeing Maiden on this tour and also watching the movie on the one day it was released nationwide, I have to say it was just as good seeing it the second time.  The heart of the movie is really after the stop in LA, when the band descends into South America.  Nothing new about metal bands playing in Mexico, but the footage of the shows in Costa Rica, Columbia and beyond was phenomenal.  You just get a huge appreciation for what we in the U.S. take for granted (like, great metal bands coming to an arena near you).  To watch what kids in some countries have to go through to see a band in \\"the a** of the world\\", as one guy in Costa Rica put it, is simply unbelievable.  The scene of the fans in Columbia, camping out for a week, being abused by the police and stripped of their food, really put things in perspective.      And here's the kicker: these kids are just so thankful that ANYONE would play in their respective countries, Maiden doesn't even have to work hard to put on a good show!  But they do, and then some.  These guys are absolute professionals, and while they are clearly enjoying the fruits of their labors from the past 2+ decades of performing, they really do seem to care about putting on a show that's worthy of the hard-earned dollars their fans paid to see them.  I never tire of hearing them perform their \\"hits\\" and I will always see them when they come to town.  This package set is definitely worth the money and these are great DVDs to toss in the DVD player while you're working out!
B001UV4XU6|5.0|The professional critics have been all over the map on this movie, so when we ended up watching it (simply because we arrived at the wrong time to see Julie and Julia) I really did not know what to expect.  But it stars Zooey Deschanel and I have become a bit of a fan. She has fabulous talent. So we watched it.  And it was one of the best films I have seen in a long time.    I think part of my reaction to this movie stems from the fact that this film is not a formula movie. As you are told upfront this is NOT a love story. It is a story about love.  We are taken back and forth over a timeline of 500 days from the moment boy meets girl to the moment when the boy finally lets go of his romantic fantasy.  But along the way we watch the two protaganists grow as people. This movie reminds us that real love actually is possible- but that it is not to be confused with romantic fantasy.  As I watched this movie unfold I realized that the negative critics were judging this film by the wrong standards- they were confusing it with a romance or a romantic comedy- when it is neither. Instead this movie reminded me of another movie: Cowboys and Angels. That movie was also NOT a formulaic love story but instead another movie ABOUT love. A movie that explores love.  We need more movies that do that- movies that we can learn from- or in which we can see ourselves, like this one.  Many of us can relate to this story all too well. But we can also relate to the ending, when it becomes clear that all the pain that the boy has been through has been both necessary and worthwhile: Because now he is ready to begin his real love story, now that he will see the woman herself, rather than just projecting his image of what he thinks he wants onto her. And that is what love is all about- not projecting an expectation and asking the other person to live up to a fantasy but rather actually wanting to be with the real person for themselves.
B001EOOQEM|5.0|With the departure of Ozzy Osbourne, Black Sabbath had some pretty big shoes to fill. They recruited none other than Elf frontman Ronnie James Dio. The effect was instant and a magical chemistry was created and spawned some really great music. Dio writes about magic, dragons and other topics of fantasy and really adds another dimension to an already incredible band. This is a great album that takes the listener on a roller coaster of melodic and HEAVY metal. The title track is of course one of the greatest tracks but others such as Neon Knights and Children of the Sea are still favorites of Sabbath fans to this day. Lonely is the word is a bit slower but is at the same time on of the heaviest tunes here. This CD can stay in your player for a long time and you will find yourself coming back for more. Overall, the production, song selection, tempo and so many other facets are just phenomenal. Do your ears a favor and crank this one up.
B001OQCV9M|4.0|Amy Adams is a great actress but many people were disappointed in her role in this movie. I heartily disagree- I found her poignant and endearing.  Meryl Streep just nails Julia Childs's mannerisms- but I am not sure she really understood what Julia was all about. I enjoyed her perfomance but I think she missed the heart of Julia Childs- her boundless enthusiasm for learning and living.  Maybe this last was an impossible standard to meet- few people realize that Julia Childs was a huge role model for the men who grew up in the late sixties and Seventies: She taught the men of America the value of enjoying life and living. And the value of approaching life with enthusiasm. She had a huge impact on this country far greater than most people really understand. So maybe my expectations of Ms Streep are simply impossibly high in this particular instance.
B0002XMF5S|3.0|This album was never meant to be a \\"Black Sabbath\\" album. It was named as such late in the recording process. Fans were expecting a typical Sabbath approach and some were dissappointed. When you look at is as the solo project it was meant to be and give the songs a chance, you will discover a really tight well recorded album. Several tracks are very catchy. If you like a bluesy feel, then \\"Heart Like A Wheel\\" will appeal to you. No Stranger To Love is the real star here though several others are certainly worthy of a listen as well. Don't expect classic Sabbath and you will find an enjoyable album.
B0000AYJXR|5.0|This was a movie we really enjoyed.  I bought it for my two year old twin grand boys who love basketball like their Dad.  It was a great way for my son and them to spend some time together.  The boys loved the animation and they sat and watched the entire movie.  Of course it had to be watched again the next day.  The quality of the movie was excellent.  The delivery was outstanding.  I was told I would receive in 5-10 days and I had it in 3 days.  I enjoyed this the first time it was on the movie screen and I relived my enjoyment watching with my grand sons.  Thanks for helping to make a wonderful memory.
B0021L8US0|5.0|While searching for alien encounter videos, I discovered a little clip titled \\"Alive in Jo'burg\\" on YouTube by Neill Blomkamp.  Fortunately for us, Blomkamp's ill-fated Halo movie was delayed, so he went back to his roots with the film that started it all: District 9.<br /><br />If you've seen Alive in Jo'burg you know much of what's going on in District 9 (this review contains spoilers!). In essence, a giant alien saucer lands on Earth and its citizens are repatriated in Johannesburg. However, the aliens are ugly, uncivilized squid-like monstrosities and thus integration attempts (when they happen at all) go poorly.  The movie begins with a battle with a telekinetic mech and ends with riots in the streets.<br /><br />District 9 adds meat to the bones of this highly original film. The aliens are no longer blurry actors in masks but crustacean-like beasts in fully-realized CGI. The ship and the conflict in Johannesburg is still a major plot point, but it is explored through Wikus Van De Merwe (Sharlto Copley). Wikus is a bigoted but cheerful company man who just happens to be married to the daughter of the head of Multi-National United (MNU). He documents the task of relocating the \\"prawns\\" (a racial slur for the aliens) to a concentration camp through video, with frequent asides asking the producer to remove particularly embarrassing shots in editing.<br /><br />In this tightly scripted film, every detail is important: the fact that the aliens have powerful weapons technology only they can use; that the Nigerians take advantage of the prawns by selling them prostitution (and all that implies) and cans of cat food in exchange for said weapons; and that the Nigerians believe they can acquire the power of a prawn through cannibalism.<br /><br />Blomkamp quickly achieves a sense of rising dread through documentary-style clips where various experts expound on \\"what Wikus did.\\" The special effects used in creating the prawn are a critical part of making them utterly alien. This is counterbalanced by a horrifying scene where Wikus destroys prawn eggs by setting them ablaze, comparing the popping sound of the roasting babies to popcorn.  As a new parent, when Wikus threatens a young prawn, I flinched.  And just like that, I was now on the side of the aliens.<br /><br />An important but unlikely plot twist brings Wikus around to the alien side of life. Betrayed by his company and his father-in-law, he has no choice but to work with Christopher Johnson, an alien who knows more than he lets on. Together, they unveil the depth of corruption in both the squalid slums of Johannesburg and the clean corporate offices of MNU.  No organization or race walks out of this film unscathed.<br /><br />Combining elements of [[ASIN:B000059HAD Alien Nation]] and [[ASIN:B000059HAC Enemy Mine]], District 9 adroitly balances political commentary on apartheid with Peter Jackson-ian levels of violence. The movie ends with more questions than answers and the certainty of a sequel.

0743298039|3.0|While author Diane Setterfield pays ample tribute to the Gothic novel in her debut, `The Thirteenth Tale,\\" she fails to fully engage her readers.  Its not as if the story isn't interesting--it is.  The tale of Angelfield and its strange family are fraught with all manner of things macabre that is the stuff of which the Gothic genre thrives.  However, perhaps due to the outer body narration of Ms. Margaret Lea who as a third party conduit has little to do psychologically with the emotional drama contained within the walls of the old estate, readers find that the filter of truth that Ms Lea supposedly brings to the table further distances them from participating fully in the conundrum around which \\"The Thirteenth Tale\\" is designed.<br /><br />Take for instance the narrator in \\"[[ASIN:0380730405 Rebecca]],\\" the classic modern Gothic by the prolific and magical Daphne Du Maurier (check out this biography about her:[[ASIN:0812218361 Daphne du Maurier, Haunted Heiress (Personal Takes)]] ).  Published in 1938, \\"Rebecca\\" still manages to thrill and titillate its audience with its psychologically driven characters and atmospheric setting--the almost-paradise of Manderley where one too many snakes have slithered in amongst the magnificent gardens and drawing rooms to ruin this 20th century Eden.  The so wisely un-named narrator with her flyaway hair, unsophisticated manner of dressing and lack of self-esteem and identity becomes a veritable Alice down the rabbit hole.  She has much on the line, one discovers as her story unfolds: her marriage, her safety, her life, her husband . . . the list goes on. Her marked insecurity and her personal stake tantalize us as readers--we cannot wait to uncover the mystery of \\"Rebecca\\" as we race towards its last page and even then we are tantalized further by the image of the horizon, reddened as if by blood and the glint of ashes that blew in `with the salt wind from the sea.'  Throughout the narrative we feel the narrator's insecurity; each and every affront to her, we also experience as blows to our reader egos.<br /><br />Not so with Setterfield's narrator, Ms. Lea.  Hired for her skill as a biographer by the renowned and much loved Vida Winter -an author with more than fifty novels under her belt, the bookish Margaret journeys to her home on the Bronte sisters' fabled moors of Yorkshire to capture on paper the elderly woman's personal history.  Now Margaret has a few secrets of her own and when Miss Winter begins her tale, she is compelled by the similarities between them--driven, so to speak to discern the truth from the layers of storytelling that Winter has so adeptly applied to shelter herself from sorrow.  That's all well and good, but it wasn't enough of a connect for me as Lea's story just serves as an outer frame for Winter's more intriguing tale of love amidst dysfunction and betrayal.<br /><br />Setterfield uses the well-worn technique of Margaret's narration to introduce Vida Winter's telling of her own history.  As a guest in Winter's home, Ms Lea travels from her bedroom to the library where she listens and commits to memory the elderly author's installments.  We are made to understand that she has little life or love of her own, other than the reading that she does for pleasure and in conjunction with her role as her father's assistant in her family's bookshop.  Nonetheless, she does have needs that are expressed often throughout her exposure to Winter.  However, rather than pull me into the story more fully, they served as a buffer that disallowed me from fully engaging in the strange tale of Winter's life.  From this reviewer's perspective, I believe the story would have been better told from the vantage point of another character, perhaps Ms. Winter herself as grand dame of the British contemporary novel looking back at her life where her characters were all fully fleshed out, but her most major player--herself--lacks substance and definition.  This would mean that Margaret's story would wait and be told in another book with another hook.<br /><br />\\"The Thirteenth Tale\\" leaves no loose ends; the mystery is finely defined. Setterfield's observations about language, the oneness of twins and the loneliness of life even when publicly acclaimed are particularly poignant.  To more fully observe that for which the elderly woman searched her entire life, I would have liked to see the character Vida Winter as a middle-aged woman, not only as a child and octogenarian.  Setterfield's depiction of sibling love and fealty reminds me of Kate Morton's portrayal of sisters and cousins in \\"[[ASIN:1416550534 The House at Riverton: A Novel]]\\" and \\"[[ASIN:1416550542 The Forgotten Garden: A Novel]]\\", albeit these were both better reads for this genre.  Nevertheless, throughout Margaret's narrative, I found myself slightly bored by the typically Gothic scene: the decaying manor house so like Miss Havisham's Satis House ([[ASIN:0141439564 Great Expectations (Penguin Classics)]], the fire from Thornfield Manor ([[ASIN:030745519X Jane Eyre (Vintage Classics)]]), the intrusive rain so plentiful and destructive in [[ASIN:1593081286 Wuthering Heights (Barnes & Noble Classics)]] and by the lack of a dark and mysterious hero to beat faster the heart of the rather bland Ms. Lea. (Sorry, the doctor of the second to last chapter does not do it for me--I'd fashion a character like Raoul from [[ASIN:1556526180 Nine Coaches Waiting]] by the esteemed Mary Stewart.)  Thankfully, Setterfield does treat us to a denouement not unlike that in Jane Eyre for which the near future of all characters small and large are accounted.  However her postscriptum with its attempt at the supernatural leads us back to the bowels of the past rather than bring our Ms Lea into a shinier happier future like all good Gothics should.<br /><br />Bottom line:  \\"The Thirteenth Tale\\" by Diane Setterfield just didn't connect for me.  Reminiscent in feel to the 2009 film \\"[[ASIN:1844085694 Angel]]\\" adapted from the novel by Elizabeth Taylor, the plot involves a story within a story with an outrageous cast of characters that are difficult to like.  Modeling her elderly authoress on the likes of a Daphne Du Maurier or a Patricia Highsmith (check out the thirteen tales in [[ASIN:0393323668 The Animal-Lover's Book of Beastly Murder]]), Setterfield would have been better off telling her tale from her elderly author's vantage point to fully take advantage psychological nuance and fierce emotional desires.

B0017JKEL8|1.0|Everything they say about this show is true, but the enjoyment is spoiled by the fact that I've encountered a manufacturer's defect in the blu-ray version--near the end of episode 10, disc 3---there is a loud buzz for about 30 seconds.  This occurred on both my original order, which I returned for an exchange.  And, it is present on the replacement order which I just received. And I've had to submit a return authorization for a refund.  Definately a manufacturer's defect--maybe in a certain batch produced within a certain period of time. I am surprised that there have been no other compliants. It might be wise to wait a while before purchasing. I'm very disappointed.
1594202249|5.0|On the one hand, I pretty much loved Inherent Vice from start to finish.  It's funny--probably funnier than any other Pynchon.  Doc Sportello is a great character.  The period detail is extraordinarily vivid, in spite of occasional bits of anachronism (you can't have a Cheech and Chong reference in a novel that takes place in early 1970 (which we know it does by a reference to the NBA finals)--d'oh).  This is one instance in which you really CAN judge a book by its cover--the garish neon lettering and utopian surfer aesthetic pretty much say it all.    On the other hand, I can't help--huh.  It appears that the other hand is passing me a joint.  Far be it from me to eff up the rotation, so I'll just have a toke, pass it on, and leave it at that.  Ah.    What I was possibly going to say but now think doesn't need to be said is that the book seems a little light by Pynchon standards.  All the usual motifs are here--paranoia, red-herringy digressions, whimsical character names, song lyrics arbitrarily inserted into the text--but it is certainly the case that Inherent Vice is more plot-driven than any of the man's previous novels.  Which is to say that the pleasure of reading it derives more from the story itself and less from studying it for Meaning.      But there are two points to be made in response to that.      Point one: so what?  After the incredible weightiness of Against the Day, why SHOULDN'T he relax a little?  Do something just for fun?  Sheesh, how demanding AM I?    Point two: While admitting the novel's comparative lightness, let's not overstate things.  There's still lots to think about here, and no doubt more that will become apparent on second reading.  It should be pretty immediately obvious that Pynchon is in part riffing on the same themes as Vineland does (there are a few unobtrusive references to the earlier novel, as well as a few minor common characters--whee!): the apparently limitless utopian possibilities of the sixties, squandered, lost, andreplaced by the stultifying, conformist, authoritarian materialism of the eighties.  Doc has periodic intimations throughout the novel that something's got to give.  While this might not be a book to launch a thousand dissertations, it's plenty smart in its own right, and it is to Pynchon's credit that he was able to so effectively write a novel in a previously unfamiliar idiom and make it totally Pynchonian (though I guess after Mason & Dixon, this shouldn't surprise us, right?).    One might suggest that this novel might draw in a fair number of Pynchon newbies (who might then be badly poleaxed by Gravity's Rainbow), but I'm not sure whether or not that's a true statement.  It's definitely his most accessible novel, but the fact remains that a lot of the pleasure in reading it, for a confirmed cultist like me, comes from reveling in the ineffable Pynchoness of it all.  I'm not quite solipsistic enough to imagine that a person lacking the background to recognize this aura would necessarily find it similarly compelling.  What I'm trying to say is, who knows if this review will be of any use to you whatsoever?  However, the trend of me loving every Pynchon novel continues.  If I say that I hope the next one (yes! I'm being optimistic! Hey, it worked last time, didn't it?) is a little heavier, that should in no way be taken as a slight against Inherent Vice, which I heartily recommend to you.
B00003CXZ4|3.0|This was a pretty good movie, the acting was good but the plot was alittle confusing, it jumped around alot and was alittle drawn out.
B000R7HY0K|4.0|As I'm sure you already know, Death Proof originally served as the second half of Grindhouse and this DVD edition is an extended cut of that version. Written, directed, and photographed by Quentin Tarantino, Death Proof is a loving homage to 1970s exploitation/grindhouse cinema, not just in story but in style as well. As the film begins, we're treated to an intentionally scratched and poorly edited print...It all adds to the fun of the experience.    Initially, we meet three young women (Sydney Tamiia Poitier, Vanessa Ferlito, and Jordan Ladd) whom we'll follow for about the first 50 minutes of the movie. This serves as the set-up, also introducing Stuntman Mike (Kurt Russell), the diabolical antagonist.    Grindhouse fans may be pleased to know that the \\"Missing Reel\\" has been restored and we see Arlene (Ferlito, who looks like a low-rent Angelina Jolie) giving Stuntman Mike his lapdance.    Death Proof does hit a roadblock relatively early on. Tarantino generally has a deep affection for his characters, as if his characters are his friends. However, this initial group of girls doesn't seem to have that affection. They seem less like friends than annoying acquaintances one only mildly enjoys hanging out with. That's probably why they're gone less than an hour into the movie.    14 months after meeting the initial girls, we meet four different girls; it's at this point that the scratches and other grindhouse elements disappear, along with the original tone established for the movie. The four new girls also seem to have Tarantino's affection. The characters are fun to watch and real-life stuntwoman Zoe Bell (playing herself) has a charming screen presence.    Beyond all the grindhouse elements, Tarantino also takes some time to reference his own films and Italian giallo films. It would be easy to argue that Death Proof seems more like a loosely strung-together homage than a fully-realized story...But rather than focus on that, it's a lot more fun if you just sit backand enjoy the ride.    Furthermore, Stuntman Mike is a memorable antagonist and Kurt Russell is delightfully charming and sinister. It's nice to see him taking a break from his recent family-friendly fare.    A lot of people have found Death Proof disappointing and, they're right, this is not a masterpiece. It wasn't meant to be though and this should not be overlooked. Finally, some have seen the ending as an anticlimax...But how else could this film have ended? An epilogue would not have been necessary. What one has to look at here is that Tarantino's loving homage does rise above it's influences. It is pretty good and it made me nostalgic for 1970s grindhouse movies, despite the fact that I wasn't alive in the 1970s. With it's faults, Death Proof is a good, exciting, and entertaining movie, inspired by movies that were never considered particularly good...That's an achievement in itself.    GRADE: B
0452295548|5.0|This book is so good that I bought it AFTER I read it.  I wanted to reread it and to keep it as a resource to refer to when needed.  I also wanted to be able to loan it to my friends.  This is one of the classic books of our lifetime on many levels.  Read it to understand the brain.  Read it to understand older people or people with brain injuries.  Read it to understand spirituality.  It expands on what you can see in the YouTube video.  Definitely worth getting.
B000TGCR3I|5.0|This movie was so beautifully made and although the character artwork isn't top notch, the environment and surroundings (ie Treasure Town) are so detailed.<br />Our protagonists, Black/Kuro and White/Shiro are so symbolic and the film's bitter-sweet indications of reality and about life are depicted amazingly.<br />The movie can only be described as one of the absolute best in many years. If I  say any more, I may give away parts of the movie.<br />It's a must see to understand the greatness of the film!
B00006LLNU|5.0|Its easy to get lost in Sigur Ros' ().     I cant help but hearing textures of various bands melded and blended into their mesmerizing music. Over there I hear a trace of early U2 in their anthemic, soaring, dynamic, and glorious heyday. A short while later there's no doubt that Radiohead have been sourced as an influence: creative and arty without being pompous. Then I hear Pink Floyd. Not so much in sound, but in scope and vision and texture and it's ability to take you elsewhere. This album (and most of the Sigur Ros albums) takes me places that's only reserved for the Floyd.    Listen in the dark to this with a great pair of headphones, it's truly glorious. Its music for the imagination.
B0025X4P24|5.0|Once again Vanessa Williams delivers an eclectic mix of jazz and salsa inspired tunes. With material from the likes of Stevie Wonder and Babyface, Miss V. puts her own spin on these tunes with her rich, seductive voice. One of the few real songstresses out there, its refreshing to hear this artist work her magic.
B000HLDFK4|5.0|The Lake House is a FANTASY romantic movie! Keyword people: FANTASY. All  the things in the movie where 2 people fall in love across time is impossible of coarse. But if you stop analysing the movie or have questions about it such as \\" that is not possible\\" you will not understand the movie. The main thing about this movie is that 2 people are lonely and have finally met their love of their life and want to be together!You already know that this movie is Fantasy so therefore, dont be asking questions, just see it and pretend that those fantasy things do not excist. In the end this movie is so lovable and is worth buying and seen it over and over again. Dont ask questions because they will never be answered! its fantasy! just watch the movie period! Dont be stupid spending time hating this movie cuz its impossible to understand or know it cant be for reals!!!!!!!! keyword: Fantasy!
1416550542|5.0|This book was wonderful- I was disappointed when it ended- I wanted to read more.  I am reading the House at Riverton now.  I love the way Ms. Morton takes us back in time and then comes back to the present. Very Entertaining writer.
B001C4CI8U|5.0|This is the only show that I ever had to check my watch to see if it's about to start. An amazing storyline, a touch of sci-fi, and new twists every episode. I can't wait for the second season. I'm watching the re-runs now and in fact am more amazed by the show each time I watch it. Anna Torv is brilliant. Her facial expressions, tone of voice and her character in general, she is a perfect fit for the show.
B001SO69IY|4.0|Redman & Method Man have both been in the hip hop game for many years.  Method Man, with The Wu Tang Clan and his so so solo albums, other than \\"Tical\\" and Redman with his association with EPMD & Def Squad and with his solo albums as well.   Together, when they created \\"How High\\" on The Show soundtrack and their first collaboration CD, [[ASIN:B00001QGPS Blackout!]], they definitely had a formula going.     My favorite tracks from the CD included the title track, \\"Y.O.U\\", \\"Da Rockwilder\\", \\"Cereal Killer\\", \\"Run 4 Cover\\" w/Ghostface & Streetlife and \\"4 Seasons\\" w/LL Cool J & Ja Rule.    They even managed to create a movie and a short lived TV show based on \\"How High\\".    They also have been featured on alot of collaborations that I have enjoyed such as LL Cool J's \\"4,3,2,1\\", Styles P's \\"Good Times\\" (Remix), Pharoahe Monch's \\"Simon Says\\" (Remix) and Ghostface's \\"Buck 50\\" from \\"Supreme Clientele\\".     You would have thought that it wouldn't have taken 10 years for them to release a sequel. However, in 2009 we have finally been blessed with \\"Blackout 2\\".   If you still think that these 2 MCs don't have it as a group, the \\"BO2 Intro\\" will quickly silence any nay sayers.     Havoc of Mobb Deep shows up to produce \\"I'm A Dope N_____\\" as he provides a nice beat for the first full length song on the album.    Pete Rock produces the 1st single \\"A-Yo\\", which features Saukrates on the hook.     They show that they can still make something for the radio that is worth listening to.  You just won't hear anything like that on the radio stations here in the DMV, (DC, Maryland & Virginia) eventhough they are showing their 2nd single and one of my favorite tracks on this CD, \\"Ms. International\\" some love.    \\"City Lights\\" uses a sample from the late, great Pimp C and Redman, Method Man and Bun B pay tribute the best way they can by droppin' nice 16s on the Nasty Kutt track.  Although, they could have left the autotune at home.    \\"Dis Iz 4 All My Smokers\\" is self expanatory but Red & Meth's fans won't be disappointed at all.   The best moment on the CD is obviously \\"4 Minutes To Lockdown\\", which is a collaboration that features Redman, Method Man, Raekwon & Ghostface. You will definitely listen to this track more than once when you first play the CD.     Buckwild definitely uses the Blue Notes' sample \\"Here I Am\\" to perfection as Red & Meth save something for the ladies on \\"Mrs. International\\".    This track will never get old as Red & Meth mix in humor to convey their ode to the ladies on this album.      There are some hit and miss tracks on this CD and the last 2 tracks \\"I Know Sumptn\\" and \\"A Lil Bit\\" are just plain awful.   They definitely should have ended this CD after the 15th track.   All the other tracks are atleast tracks that you can listen to almost every time you listen to this CD.   It's nice to get another release from Red & Meth, but this definitely would have caught even more attention had it been released years earlier.    Red & Meth fans won't be disappointed though and this will be a welcome addition to any hip hop fan's collection.      James' Top 5    1) 4 Minutes To Lockdown w/Raekwon & Ghostface  2) Mrs. International  3) Dangerous Mcees  4) I'm A Dope N______  5) City Lights w/Bun B    Honorable Mention:    BO2 (Intro)  A-Yo w/Saukrates  Dis Iz 4 All My Smokers  Father's Day  Errbody Scream w/Keith Murray
B0018RBN8C|5.0|Duffy's \\"Rockferry\\" is one of the best album purchases I've ever made.  The album was and is thoroughly enjoyable.  Duffy has one of the most unique voices I've ever heard and I can't imagine anyone else singing the songs from this album as well as she does.   All of the songs on this album are excellent and I would recommend it to anyone who asked about it in a heartbeat!  If I absolutely had to pick my favorite songs from this album, my top five would be (in no particular order):  Warwick Avenue, Serious, Syrup & Honey, Mercy, and I'm Scared.  If you've been thinking about buying this album, do it, you won't regret it... enjoy!!!
B00004WXTL|5.0|Got this as a gift for my boyfriend.  He loved it.      Scary delivery process though.  My order was sent to the wrong address.
B00288KNJU|4.0|I just watched the movie this past weekend in 3D on Blu-Ray. I was skeptical of the 3D effects, and disappointed that it was the \\"old\\" blue/red, now orange/green glasses, and not a \\"clear\\" technology like the movie theaters. I was pleasantly surprised by the 3D effects, they worked well almost all the time and enhanced the movie experience. I haven't watched it in 2D yet, so I can't say I \\"lost\\" an experience with \\"full colors\\", but I wasn't following the \\"pink house\\" thing (it was gray to me), so I certainly missed that! I did have some issues with \\"losing\\" the 3D effect and just seeing blurriness, but I'd suspect that was an individual thing. Overall I'd say it was good to see it in 3D and I'd do it again, but I suspect I'll watch it again more often in 2D.    As for the movie itself,I thought it had a good plot. I think their ending was slightly confusing, as both my wife and mother required clarification (but she always does, you guess which \\"she\\"). I would recommend renting the movie, but I wouldn't buy it unless you want to demo \\"3D\\" features to friends or have children who'd watch it again and again.

B000B5T2LM|4.0|Unlike Audrey Hepburn's [[ASIN:B001EXE300 Sabrina - The Centennial Collection]], you don't have to study in Paris to be a French chef thanks to this iconic cookbook written by Julia Child & company.  The book is laid out methodically for the novice as well as the experienced cook: essential equipment, ingredients, definitions, temperatures, basic cutting techniques and a short comprehensive guide to cooking with, drinking, storage and serving of wine.<br /><br />The chapters (title pages decorated with three adorable fleur-de-lis) are laid out from soup to desserts interspersed with helpful hints as well as variations on most themes as it were.  You are going to want to master Chapter 2-Sauces before you proceed any further: the whites sauces, the brown sauces, the tomato, mayonnaise and Hollandaise sauces.  Not only are these the essence of French cooking but their mastery will give you a lot of expertise as well as a wonderful sense of satisfaction!<br /><br />Then she moves on to a chapter solely on Eggs.  Believe me, if you can master a perfect omelette or even scrambled eggs, all manner of wonderful compliments and proposals will come your way.<br /><br />Warning: many of these recipes are not easy to prepare, many of them are very time consuming and some of the ingredients are going to be darn near impossible to find.  Read them very, very carefully and in the beginning always allot more time than you reasonably think it might take.  Extra ingredients are handy in case you really botch it up the first time.<br /><br />My personal favorites are the Roast Chicken, Boeuf Bourguignon, her classic Salad Nicoise, and her recipe for Creme Fraiche.  The decadent Chantilly Creme is great on anything and her instructions on poaching fresh fruit means you never have to worry about a less than totally spectacular dessert again.  God bless you Julia!!
0061231401|5.0|I've read all of the James Rollins books and thoroughly enjoyed every one of them but this one is my all time favorite.  As always the story was well written and moved along at the perfect pace. I thought that this story had more aspects to it than other Rollins books but it all worked.  Even though there were numerous subjects of interest surrounding the story line (world hunger, decline of our bee population, conspiracy, several saints and characters with their own stories) as well as many fascinating locations, the story flowed well and each location and each subject played beautifully into the story line. For those of us who have followed Sigma from the beginning it was time for a little more romance among out team members and for those new to the series with all of the action it probably appeared minimal.  I recommend this as a must read for both the seasoned Rollins reader as well as the reader looking for a great book that's hard to put down.
B001GSV3EC|5.0|As a long time fan of Jeff, what can I say? This is Jeff at his best with great backing people. I've seen him live several times and Vinnie Calaiuto really impressed me, even more so than Terry Bozzio.   Australian, 23 year old Tal Wilkenfeld shines on bass and puts a big smile on Jeff's face. Jazz pianist Jason Rebello is excellent, but I have to say Jenifer Batten's absence is noticeable in that there are songs they weren't able to do because of her guitar not being there.  But Jeff is unbelievable with each new tour he brings something new and different out of his bag of tricks. some new technique or yet undiscovered harmonic. I've been fortunate enough to stand in the wings during sound check a couple of times and that is an incredible vantage point, but the filming of this DVD puts you about 3 feet away, what a view to see those hands play those leads from so close. He brings Eric Clapton out for two songs and that's real fun.  On a negative note I did not care for female vocalist Imogen Heap coming out on the encore bow like she was part of the band, to me this was a little bit wrong. She sang one song and has the nerve to take the encore bow. If you play guitar, bass or drums this is an excellent teaching video. I just noticed this review is probably for the CD and not the DVD, I have both. There are about 3 songs different between the two. If you only buy one make it the DVD. If you can get both by all means do it.
B001PTG4BO|4.0|The book's value, for those not engaged in ecommerce is that, at least in my view, it forces reflection and focus upon how the long tail concept might work outside of ecommerce---niches exist beyond the web.     In a manner (but not writing style) similar to Taleb's \\"Fooled by Randomness\\", Anderson points to what economic thinking long held might well be of limited value- at least in some business models.    Books that challenge conventional wisdom frequently prove to have value and I believe this book challenges.
B00067BBSC|5.0|I'll keep this simple, this is one of the best sounding DVD concerts I own. The DVD package is good with extra footage and interviews. There is CD included in the set and the concert is excellent. All the right songs, played by a good line of people. Luke is on with all of his guitar work and the band is right there on top of things.

B001QB9H10|1.0|Having seen two entertaining \\"Transporter\\" films, I was utterly disappointed with \\"Transporter 3,\\" not because of its illogical script (co-written by Luc Besson, so what can I expect?), but because of the new director Olivier Megaton, who just doesn't know how to deliver actions.     Frank Martin (played by cool Jason Statham) comes back. This time, however, ever dependable Frank is forced to his job, with a mysterious Ukrainian girl Valentina (newcomer Natalya Rudakova) by his side, and an explosive device strapped on his wrist. Frank must follow the orders of a villain (Robert Knepper, T-Bag of \\"Prison Break\\"), whose motive is unclear even after the film ends.     The stunt people (including the martial arts fight choreographer Corey Yuen) did a great job. There is one fantastic car stunt sequence involving two trailer trucks, and actions themselves are respectable. However, director Olivier Megaton single-handedly ruined everything, employing the flashy camera work and super-fast editing that makes no sense at all. Who wants to see fast-forwarded footage of car chase scene? The poorly-edited film is an insult to the stunt people and their wonderful work.    One thing must be said about the character of Valentina played by Natalya Rudakova. I have nothing against her personally, but honestly, her \\"Valentina\\" is one of the most irritating, obnoxious characters I have ever seen on screen, with her perpetually grumbling, drinking and peeing (in a store), and lengthy dialogue about food with Frank. For this kind of role to succeed, you need someone of Cate Blanchett's caliber.    The only good thing is Robert Knepper playing the delightfully evil villain quite effectively and, of course, the star Jason Statham, who hasn't lost his charisma even in this mess. He takes off his shirt in the film (twice), but you know he just doesn't need to do that, to be always cool Frank Martin.
B001DHXT20|5.0|Wow,  What Do I Say I Give this movie Four stars.  This is one of my Favorite Motion pictures. I saw Hulk in theaters in 2003 and it was ok but this should have been number 1 in 2008. This is far better than Iron man and three times, no five times more entertaining than Spiderman 3 or the Dark Kight. This stars four great actors Edward Norton, Liv Tyler, William Hurt, and last but not least, Tim Roth. Box office,  Beware, the Hulk is here and he is not happy.  One more thing, this is also better than Batman Returns, Spiderman, Spiderman 2, and Hellboy 2.
B000SEGMBO|4.0|The book is well laid out and organized, reminding us of casual programming casualties that can be avoided.  I am very pleased with the purchase however I must criticize the Kindle version which doesn't properly separate paragraphs and can be a bit awkward to read.  The content, again, is fantastic.
B000AJIF4E|5.0|I got these for college and i love their ability to block out sound (more then some noise canceling ones I've tried). Also love their mix of great sound, nice looks and relatively small size. So weather your and audiophile on a budget or a music lover that wants a headphone upgrade these are a great bet.<br /><br />*Update* 2 - 3 years after my initial purchase these are still kicking strong. Sound is still as amazing as when i first got them. One note however, don't step on them, I've done this twice and managed to break parts each time. The first break was easily fixed with super glue, the second has left duct tape as a permanent fixture. Sound quality and functionality are still as perfect as when i bought them, they just look well loved now (as they should for the amount of use they get).
B00139XSBA|2.0|I've owned \\"The Right Stuff\\" for over thirty years in print form. I downloaded the Kindle version from Amazon to take with me on business trips.<br /><br />To my disgust, the Kindle edition is abysmal - clearly, Amazon or whoever came up with it ran the print edition through a character-recognition software program and utterly failed to copy-edit it afterwards. The number of errors is alarming, and it is only because I've read the print version so many times that I was able to recognize what some of the errors meant in the text.<br /><br />It's a shame, because this book is a fine, fine book and one of my all-time favorites. Shame on Amazon or the publisher or both for charging $10.00 for a flawed, poorly-edited copy.
B00006FDCD|4.0|This movie very long, graphic and spooky, was scary to watch as a kid growing up, clowns don't scare me,but this guy is terrifying.  really creep movie,what can you expect of stephen king?
B001YB29HG|4.0|The music shines in this, but also the WRITING, WOW!  You don't even realize that this fun little show has wrapped you around its little finger with the well-drawn characters until the end, and you suddenly realize that they are living and breathing in your heart.
0385342020|2.0|All I have to say is WOW. I cannot believe that so many people enjoyed this book. When I picked up a book by this author I was expecting it to be very fanciful. However this book was way past anything I could stomach.     Neither character, Sadie or Lara was endearing. There conversations were unbearably painful for me to read. Sadie lived to be 105 and never matured past a belligerent toddle. Most of Lara concocted stories explaining Sadie and thus conversations were so pathetic, I winced while reading them.     The resolution with the uncle was so unrealistic. Oh please to protect himself I am quit certain he would have just had her silly butt just bumped off and nobody would have been the wiser and I would at least have had some sort of a surprise.     The arrival of the necklace was so anticlimactic that I cringed.    Definitely one to borrow.
0545123267|5.0|I just want to start off by saying yes this is like the craze called Twilight.      But who am I to say that is a bad thing.  I loved Twilight!  I think book is up there with the best teen romance books out today.  It was gripping and interesting and you wanted to find out what happened.      I just spent last night reading way past the time I should of been, so that I could finish it.  It's a cute romance between 2 young people.     I'm not going to go through the plot and characters like people usually do.   I am going to tell you that if you are a Twilight lover like I am then you should read this book!    Just read it!!!!!  It's worth it.
0060090367|2.0|My biggest pet peeve in the universe is when a writer can't be bothered to make a decent description so they use dated pop culture references that often mean nothing to people who don't live in the same geographic location.  I don't remember for the life of me why anyone would want to look like Jane Fonda nor do I get the references to soaps I've never heard of.  It's hack writing and I hate it.    This book was clearly written by a woman who has never had a new born baby in the house.  The idea that they mostly keep out of the way is absurd.  They don't just sleep, poop, and wake only to eat.  They are a 24/7 handful that you rarely get to set down.  I also take issue with the idea that she could gain 40lbs during pregnancy then be able to fit into her 18yr old sisters clothes a month later as if a drinking binge would solve hips spreading or extra padding.  It is completely unrealistic and ridiculous.      Otherwise, this family is immature and dysfunctional.  The father has serious emotional and intimacy issues.  The mother is a lazy, rude, and selfish brat who does not act like the grown woman she should be after raising 5 kids (which clearly she never bothered to do).  All the daughters are alcoholic, immature, rude, selfish, and greatly unpleasant.  I greatly dislike the main character which does not make me root for her in any way.  In fact, were I a responsible, mature, male accountant, I would've dumped her you-know-what years ago and found myself a sane adult to marry.      As a 31yr old single mother with an ex, a condo in the city, and I real job, I found myself wanting to give her a spanking.  Clearly the people who gave 5-stars to this book need to grow up, get a job, get a life.  Throwing tantrums isn't acceptable even in make believe.    The only good thing about this book is that it is humorous and it read very, very quickly.
B000000ZGO|5.0|Hot Buttered Soul is pretty much a perfect album. What else could someone want? It's got soul, it brings the funk, it is arranged with strings, guitar, organ etc beautifully, it's provided sample sources for such great artists such as Public Enemy and Wu-Tang, and that VOICE - what a voice!   And to think this album may have never been! Apparently after Otis Redding's death Atlantic pulled all funds out of Stax records and the head of Stax got the whip out and demanded like 25-30 records from the Stax crew in 6 months or something. However the story goes...  The thing I especially like about this album is there are only 4 tracks and they really extend over the 3.30 radio-play type song. Hayes is really able to make the two covers (Walk On By & By The Time I Get To Phoenix) his own while showing he can bring his own two songs (Hyperbolicnahasapeterwhatever & One Woman) with the same feel and standard. I especially like track 2, its funky to death! It may sound corny but I believe Hayes lisetning to this album, I feel he really believes and feels how this album sounds, and not many albums can do this to me to the same level, especially considering the state of modern R&B / soul artists.   You have to give this album a go, infact give it multiple goes. It'll get under your skin.   R.I.P. Isaac Hayes
B001FB4W0W|5.0|I absolutely love this show and can't wait for season 2 to come out on DVD so I can buy it too!
B00007G1ZC|5.0|There are eight dream sequences in the DVD. They are totally independent and do not have anything to do with each other, so each one is like a 'short story' yet they stand on their own as complete films and each one is told with the pertinent imagery, language and pace that is typical of dreaming. This is so well done that we feel at times we are either dreaming the movie or seeing a projection of someone's dreams as they happen. I do not know of any better rendition of the dream state in film, this is an extraordinary accomplishment and one of Kurosawa's greatest achievements.Yet we should also be aware that the subject of dreams is much more relevant and important within the Japanese cultural context than in ours. From an earlier date, one of their greatest literary novels is titled \\"As I crossed a Bridge of Dreams\\" (11th Century) and through the centuries to modern times it is a recurrent theme, that in the 20th century was best expressed by Yukio Mishima's main character in the tetralogy \\"Sea of Fertility\\" ,Kiyoaki Matsugae, who keeps a dream diary, which actually predicts the developments of events in the novel.    Here is the List of Dreams in the film:    1-A Peach Orchard 2-Mount Fuji in Red 3-The Tunnel 4-The Weeping Demon 5-The Blizzard 6-Crows 7-Sunshine through the Rain 8-The Village in the Watermills     I Have not listed them in order, The first is Sunshine through the Rain, a beautiful fairy tale seeing through the eyes of a child, which is the same theme of the second, with another tale, yet both are totally different. Each one of these tales is a separate dream, and like all dreams they have their own rules that only make sense there. The cinematography is masterful even by Kurosawa standards, for all the dreams, but particularly spectacular in these first two in showing simultaneously the nature of Japan, and the traditional deities of Shinto, Japan's ancient pagan religion that preceded Buddhism and Zen, and is still part of the country's culturalcore.. Crows is about a gallery visitor that actually climbs inside a Van Gogh painting and pursues Van Gogh through the fields. Martin Scorcesse plays Van Gogh beautifully, this was like a fantasy trip. The Blizzard is about a snowstorm in the mountains involving a climbing team, and is more like a short hallucination that one of the mountain climbers has for a moment, before he wakes and continues climbing.    Mount Fuji in Red is the horrifying nightmare of several atomic plants that explode around the volcano, with fearsome yet beautiful impact. It is Kurasawa's commentary on atomic energy, which along with the 'genius' of Einstein has aged very badly in Contemporary culture. It is worth noting that he belongs, along with Marx and Freud, to a group of scientist philosophers from the 19th Century that really believed in progress, and the three have largely failed in 'changing the world' and have become instead clearly passé. In the age of ozone layer pollution, irreversible atomic waste, Capitalist Russia/China and Prozac, all these once grand hopes and dreams of progress have faded or evaporated altogether. The Weeping Demon is another dream that dwells in the post atomic, post modern world which has become a nightmare, and here Kurosawa goes back to the very beginning of film history to scenery reminiscent of Giuseppe De Liguoro's \\"L'Inferno \\", a 1910 film setting for Dante's Inferno that was extremely influential in establishing the iconography, and landscapes of the hellish universe, which looks very much like the world of the Weeping Demon. The tunnel is a war story that will be particularly touching to the military minded. It is Kurosawa's commentary on war in which a captain remembers his lost platoon, and they come back from the dead, first one man, then all of them in formation to be dismissed by him one last time. The Village in the Watermills is the closing dream. It is also a tale of nature and traditional values in contrast to the modern world, deeply philosophical and beautiful.
B000002UAU|5.0|When I think of 'Sgt. Peppers Lonely Hearts Club Band,' one word comes to mind: Masterpiece. Never has there been an album quite like 'Sgt. Peppers,' and never again will there be. Released in 1967 on Apple Records, The Beatles own label, 'Sgt. Peppers Lonely Hearts Club Band' came at a time when The Beatles were transitioning.     Take yourself back to 1964. The Beatles broke through in America in February of that year with an appearance on 'The Ed Sullivan Show.' Songs like 'She Loves You,' 'I Want to Hold Your Hand,' 'Love Me Do' and countless others became a part of what was to be called the \\"Beatlemania\\" craze in America and in Britain.    Fast forward three years, to 1967. The once clean-looking Beatles with their haircuts were long gone, with group donning facial hair and long hair now. They were officially part of the hippie movement of the 1960s. Beatlemania was attracting an even wider audience.    Now that I've done the history report for you, let's get to the review.    In 2004, Rolling Stone magazine published it's Top 500 Greatest Albums of All-Time. 'Sgt. Peppers Lonely Hearts Club Band' was ranked #1. And I can't say I disagree. This album is one of the finest albums ever made, with not a single weak spot on the record. I don't think I have ever said this about any album, but it's perfect. It's one of the few truly perfect albums (only The Beach Boys' 'Pet Sounds,' from 1966, comes to mind).     The Lennon/McCartney songwriting duo were at their finest here, writing some of the finest material -- dare I say it -- ever written. But that comes as no surprise.     'Sgt. Peppers Lonely Hearts Club Band/With A Little Help from My Friends' opens the record. One of the greatest opening tracks on any album, but then again, it's one of the greatest songs PERIOD on any album. Ringo Starr makes a vocal appearance here singing on 'With A Little Help.' \\"What would you do if I sang out of key?...\\" he sings to open the track. This is easily one of Lennon/McCartney's finest songs.     'Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds' is controversial (notice the LSD reference) but is one of the finest psychedelic rock songs ever. Lennon's voice is at it's finest here, and 'Diamonds' successfully shows off his vocal range, which is actually quite incredible.     Perhaps my all-time favorite Beatles song is one that comes later in the album, 'Being for the Benefit of Mr. Kite!.' This is perhaps, in my honest opinion, the finest song on the entire album. Lennon sings about a circus, and about a man named Pablo Bank. Lennon apparently wrote this song based on a painting which sold for a lot of money at auction several years ago.    George Harrison shows off his talent not only as a sitar player but also as a songwriter on 'Within You Without You.' This song is perhaps the most experimental track on the entire album, and it displays Harrison's fascination for Indian music.     Two of McCartney's finest songs he ever performed are the ballad 'She's Leaving Home' and 'Lovely Rita.' McCartney's voice is fresh and perfect here. McCartney's other vocal appearances here are 'Fixing A Hole' and 'When I'm Sixty Four,' which became strangely autobiographical for Paul in 2006, when he himself turned 64. The clarinet and simple drum beat fit 'Sixty Four' perfectly.    But one of the major highlights of the album is the final track 'A Day in the Life.' This miniature opera is a classic way to close this masterpiece. Lennon and McCartney trade vocal duties on this song, and one doesn't need me to say that this is one of the greatest songs The Beatles ever recorded.    Many of you who stumble upon this review -- odds are, have listened to 'Sgt. Pepper's' many times like I have, so they don't need me to say how great this album is. But for those who are about to hear 'Sgt. Pepper's' for the first time, let me tell you how much of a treat you are in for. This is one of the finest albums ever made, so sit back, relax, turn the lights down low, close your eyes and just listen. That's the best advice I can offer one listening to this album for the first time.    Overall, this album is perhaps the greatest album ever made, but one doesn't need me to say that. It's a masterpiece. Listen and for 39 minutes and 45 seconds, be blown away by the musical forcefield that is 'Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band.'    I can't recommend this album enough. Regardless of what style of music you listen to, 'Sgt. Pepper's' NEEDS to be in your collection if it isn't already. It should be a requirement. It's that good.    Highly, highly, highly (I can't say that enough!) recommended.    ENJOY!!!
B001DF68MA|5.0|This is a great bike seat - one that I have no regrets on purchasing.  I have shopped on Amazon for a few years but this is the first review that I have taken the time to write.  I am 5'3 and own a Trek 7100 WSD bike - 14inch.  It was somewhat difficult to install the seat becasue I did not take time to read the directions.  I had to separate the bars, install separately and then attach in the center.  When I first took it out of the box I did not think that my 2 yr old - 30lb - 38 inch - shoe size 8.5 son would fit - BUT HE DOES!!  More importantly - HE LOVES IT!!  My reason for posting this review is because I was very skeptical that this would work - based off my height BUT when it went on sale for $40 - I had to try it!!  I WISH I had broken down last year as I KNOW that next year he will be too tall for it.  My son ABSOLUTELY LOVES HIS BIKE SEAT!  When we ride my knees are slightly pointed outward BUT it dosen't bother me at all.  The only problem was coming to complete stop.  Instead of jumping off the seat to stop - I lean slightly to the left or right.... that took a little getting use to... but we both love it and have been going bikeriding every day that we can.... I'm glad that they improved the padding on the seat because the bike ride always sends my son to sleep... I wish they made a bigger seat so that I wouldnt have to invest in a burley..... but this seat has great memories!!!  Don't hesitate!!!
B001FB4W0M|5.0|This show is AMAZING! And the 4th season doesn't even let you stop and catch your breath. It's fantastic acting, great special effects, a deep and thought out story line with the 4 main characters that are irreplacable and funny, (Dean, Sam, Bobby, & the car), it has a fun and fitting rock n' roll soundtrack.<br />This season picks up a few months after the 3rd season ended and it's GREAT how they tied everything in.<br /><br />If I could give this show 100 stars I would. Absolutely love it!

0307588335|1.0|The first half of this book has nothing, I repeat, NOTHING to do with Lehman Brothers.  It is 150 pages of Larry McDonald indulging himself and boring the reader with his life story.  I have no problem with a short intro that includes the author's background but spending half the book celebrating your own career is obnoxious and completely unrelated to the story of Lehman, which is what this book is supposedly about.  If you want to write a book dedicated to praising yourself then title it accordingly, do not sell it as the story of Lehman Brothers.    I worked at Lehman during the years that the author was there I was really hoping for some insights into my former employer.  Unfortunately, all I got was an autobiography of a man I never wanted to learn about.

B000OYC3J8|5.0|I first heard the WHITE STRIPES when I was in my late 50s.  I am now 61 and I still listen to them every day.  I also listen to the Raconteurs (also Jack White) and now Dead Weather (ditto).  As someone who went to college in the late 1960s, this is the freshest music for me which has come out since that time period.  ICKY THUMP is right at the top of all of these albums for me. Expanding their instruments, eerie bagpipes and Flamenco horns are added to this album with great effect.  I loved their inclusion. There are many musical influence in this music but garage rock coupled with blues certainly are always at the forefront.  Having listened to Jack White now play with other musicians, I must say that his playing with Meg has been consistently underrated.  The two of them bring out the best of one another musically.  Good as Jack is on his own or with other musicians, when he plays with Meg it as as if he is playing with his soul mate. I usually don't appreciate the instruments as much as the singing on any album but that is not true on these albums.  I love the great thought that has gone into the use of each instrument and to the uniqueness of each one and to the softness or hardness of its sound.  Jack's vocalizing is terrific and fits seamlessly into every arrangement.  My only hope is that this is not the last White Stripes album since Jack now has so many other musical irons in the fire.  I don't have the technical expertise to comment on each song as other reviewers here have done. I just know I love the whole album.  There is no greater pleasure than driving in my convertible with the top down through the nearby national park and listening to this album during the summer time. This album also won two Grammys.<br /><br />Visit my blog with link given on my profile page here or use this phonetically given URL (livingasseniors dot blogspot dot com).

0061767581|4.0|I will not tell you that it's the best book I've ever read but it is an entertaining story about some girls in a big city (a variation or Lauren Conrads' life, maybe?).  Really young people, maybe in high school and juniors at college will like this book.   Reading this book made me feel that I wanted to be a teen again or to be in my earliest 20's so I can be able to have the experience they had of trying something new in a new place, the rest it was to be expected (part of that kind of life?). For me it was worth it reading it. But remember not the best book.
0066620996|3.0|Hundreds of people have rated this book and written their reviews, which demonstrates how successful this book is.       Being successful is good for a company. But, \\"good is the enemy of great,\\" as the author puts it. This paradoxical idea that the author has brought before us shows that simply being good can make a company feel complacent and lack the momentum and will to become great. I'm good, that's fine. Why risk breaking my neck to be great?       The author argues, that being great is not so unattainable. The effort you use to strive forward and become great is no harder than that necessary to make you stay good.       This book is not a theoretical analysis, but an empirical deduction. The author tries not to impose on the readers his conclusions, but wants the readers to get the idea by themselves through the materials and statistics provided by the research group headed by the author.       Staying great can be even harder than staying good. Among a dozen of \\"great\\" companies raised in this book, Fannie Mac and Circuit City have collapsed under the global financial crisis that started from the U.S. last year.       The author might not have anticipated this. If \\"great\\" companies like Fannie Mac and Circuit City can fail and bring down lots of customers with them, why bother bragging them at the beginning?
B001PR0YBM|4.0|Miyazaki has done it again: created a charming and engaginge animation, one with a spirit all its own. Fans will recognize elements from his earlier efforts, including his passion for biomorphic flying machines (flying through water this time, but still) and strong little girl in the leading role. It also presents something of an eco-fable, with seas rising as they threaten to do in our real, warming world. But, as in Miyazaki's previous films, even familiar elements combine to make a unique story.<br /><br />\\"Ponyo\\" has been likened to Hans Christian Andersen's \\"Little Mermaid,\\" probably by people who remember only the disneyfied version of the story. Yes, the water-girl loves the boy of dry land. This story, however offers a lighter spirit and happier ending than the dour Nordic tale. It also blends in, perhaps, a scrap of \\"Sorcerer's Apprentice\\" and possibly others. That hardly makes this a derivative work, however. The plot as a whole, along with the imagery that carries it, comes across as fresh despite its familiar elements.<br /><br />Although adults can enjoy Miyazaki's animations at many levels, he intends them for kids, too. This time, the target age appears to be five or so, the age of the boy (Sosuke) who costars in this feature. As such, the mood stays lighter than in some of Miyazaki's other films, and there's a big kid-power message as well. His light touch keeps the serious issues from becoming grim, though. This is an entertainment before anything else. Although not as striking as Princess Mononoke or Spirited away, it certainly entertains.<br /><br />--wiredweird
B0001XAS2G|5.0|There can be a sort of nervous caution, even trepidation, on the part of one who has encountered an album of the caliber of \\"Year of the Cat\\" which makes him or her hesitant to even listen to an artist's subsequent work for fear of ruining the opinion he or she formed of the artist.  For anyone who might suffer from that sort of nervous caution, I would simply play [[ASIN:B00122P9J2 Life In Dark Water]] once or twice.  An ode to the Mary Celeste, the archetypal ghost ship whose crew disappeared without a trace in 1867, has such a unique underwater sound throughout that heightens the sonar-like tones of Tim Renwick's lead guitar work.  While both [[ASIN:B00122R5ZI Time Passages]] and [[ASIN:B00122P9M4 Song On The Radio]] have had plenty of casual exposure on both radio and compilation releases, there are so many good songs here that one would never hear on the radio or find in a compilation.  Life In Dark Water, [[ASIN:B00122JRRC Timeless Skies]], [[ASIN:B00122JRN6 Valentina Way]], and [[ASIN:B00122R67K End Of The Day]] are all imminently enjoyable upon the first or second listening, especially the latter.  In addition to the Mary Celeste, the two other historical journeys unfolding before the listener are [[ASIN:B00122P9JW A Man For All Seasons]], regarding imprisonment and execution of Sir Thomas More when Henry VIII declared himself supreme head of the Church of England, and [[ASIN:B00122NSKY The Palace Of Versailles]] based on \\"The Earle of Salisbury\\" by William Byrd.<br /><br />Hearing \\"Time Passages\\" again does make me wish there could have been some way for Alan Parsons to produce just one more Al Stewart release.  By 1978, Parsons was having even greater success with his partner, songwriter Eric Woolfson with I ROBOT and [[ASIN:B000IOM1YG Pyramid]] which made it more difficult to give other artists the time they needed for their musical endeavors.  And on that subject, good things must also be said of Andrew Powell's lush string arrangements on Time Passages as he was, according to Parsons himself, the third member of The Project.  Regardless of the demands The Project placed on Parsons and Woolfson, Stewart soldiered on admirably with his songwriting partner Peter White.  Their studio recorded material to come as well as presenting very satisfying live performances like [[ASIN:B000MR9EOE Rhymes in Rooms]] are nothing at which to scoff.

B000002N2P|5.0|Although \\"Dookie\\" is always considered the best Green Day album, to me \\"Insomiac\\" is DEFINITELY just as good, if not BETTER. On \\"Insomniac\\", Green Day gives us the bratty attitude, heavy power chords, catchy vocal melodies, energetic drumming and powerful basslines that make these 33 minutes a true punk classic.    The music on this album is a bit heavier than \\"Dookie\\" and it's overall a bit more in-your-face, but with that comes a big slab of unforgettable songs that you can basically listen to all the way through and never get bored with. This album has spawned the popular songs such as \\"Geek Stink Breath\\" with its heavy chugging guitar riffs, the metal-influenced headbanger \\"Brain Stew\\" which feels like the entire song is one big breakdown...in a good way!, the very fast and very punk \\"Jaded\\", and the semi-sarcastic, semi \\"I don't care\\" attitude of \\"Stuck With Me\\".    Those songs right there capture Green Day in their prime, but even beyond that we get even more. \\"Aramtage Shanks\\", the opener, reminds me quite a bit of \\"Burnout\\", the first song on \\"Dookie\\". \\"Brat\\" is one of my favorite old Green Day songs with a very catchy vocal melody throughout the chorus. \\"86\\" is another sing-a-long with a really cool overall vibe to it. \\"Panic Song\\" has a frantic opening bassline and a long, really well-written intro. The rest of the songs all fit in together really well and flow nicely, making it an overall conscice and smooth album.    \\"Insomniac\\" is definitely one of the best albums of punk in the last 20 years, and is far too underrated for its own good. With that being said, I hope all reader will go to the store, pick it up and crank it in your room, your car, wherever. \\"Insomniac\\" is Green Day at their best! Thanks for the time, and peace.

He remembers well and writes well.<br /><br />I would have loved to have been there.  Since I wasn't, I am delighted to find a book that brings me inside those exciting days of Cape Canaveral (later Cape Kennedy), Houston, and all the rest.
B000HWXS2S|5.0|Hearing this album for the first time, I was simply breathtaken. Amon Amarth have managed to balance the \\"melodic\\" and the \\"death\\" of melodic death metal so incredibly well that you're given one of the most epic albums of all time. There's hardly a single song (possibly one, but I can't point to any at the very moment) on the entire thing that isn't so fantastically melodically driven that you hum along or start headbanging on the spot. It's the sound of honor and hooves, the Swedish beard-men that could drive legions to charge down on a lonely village. It's staggering. And not only are the melodies and the brutality there, you're taken through it with Johan Hegg's death growl, almost perfectly pitched right between epic and deep - powerful but audible, raw but not absurd. It's even a bit emotional, all the while being about the absense of emotion!<br /><br />Maybe there is a weak track on the thing, and maybe it only deserves a 4.5 or 4.8, but overall it's one of my favourite albums ever, just one of those things that you want to blast out at a near constant. Bringing viking lore, honor, death and brutality all together, all you can say is \\"Skål!\\" and hail the victorious dead!
1933771690|1.0|The central theme of this book is that life creates the universe and that consciousness lies at the center of existence. This is not a new idea and there is absolutely nothing new in this book. Lanza draws on two main sources to back up this idea. The first is that consciousness appears to cause the wave function to collapse in the famous double slit experiment. The second concerns the anthropic principle and how it seems that universe is uncannily just right for life. Both of these 'proofs' are open to various interpretations including the possibility that consciousness does indeed lie at the center of creation. However, that is only one possible conclusion that can be drawn and Lanza adds absolutely zero to the debate. He uses his book to lambaste physics and physicists for such like as not being able to tell us what came before the big bang, whilst at the same time declaring consciousness to be the be all and end all of everything without actually defining what consciousness is or offering any sort of explanation of how it came into existence or how it creates the physical universe. On top of that much of the book contains sections that have absolutely nothing to do with the subject matter and concern nothing more than Lanza's own life experiences. He uses these chapters to butter his own biscuit, blast his own trumpet and bang his own drum interspersed with a bit of name dropping. The worst book I've read all year!

B0002DB50E|1.0|This movie has a preposterous and dated plot consisting of mostly half-understood McLuhan, The acting is very poor. The script is worse.

B001UV4XL0|3.0|All of the previews and trailers for \\"A Perfect Getaway\\", the newest killer-on-the-loose-in-tropical-paradise movie, make it look sub-par, at best. Every preview for this movie has made it look like another bad action/horror movie that has has a \\"twist you won't believe\\" at the end. After seeing all the positive reviews, I was moved to go see it, partly because of the reviews and also because it has some good actors in it, including Steve Zahn playing an actual adult role. I was surprised at how much I enjoyed the movie, which begins as a quiet Agatha Christie-esque mystery and then becomes a frenetic action movie.  Steve Zahn and Milla Jovovich play a newly married couple taking a vacation in Hawaii. Hiking up a trail, they meet a former soldier (Timothy Olyphant, from \\"Deadwood\\") who shows them back to a lake. It turns out they're going to the same trail, the two newlyweds and the soldier, along with his girlfriend. It's around this time that the two couples are informed that two serial killers, suspected to be a couple, are killing newlyweds and other couples. Bring in the requisite red-herring couple (Marley Shelton and Chris Hemsworth), who have about five minutes of screen time, and I'm not ruining anything when I say it was obvious from the beginning who wasn't at fault.  Remarkably, amidst some of the bigger cliches in the movie, after the first 20 minutes the movie completely comes into its own. There is some great acting, including from Jovovich,  who I've only seen in the \\"Resident Evil\\" movies, but here she has a nice dramatic role, including a bizarre but effective scene where she details her troubled past that seems odd at the time but come into play later, and makes more sense. The movie manages to create some genuine tension, especially near the end, and Olyphant is always entertaining, creating comedy and tension by just moving his face.  One of the more admirable traits of the movie is that it reveals the \\"big twist\\" almost as soon as the movie turns over into one hour, and then a stylishly effective black and white flashback sequence sets up how we got there. The best thing, by far, in the movie is how the villains aren't portrayed as likable people whose only downside is that they kill people, which is most evident in \\"Natural Born Killers.\\" Here, they're portrayed as creepy, evil, and incredibly violent people with a meth problem. While the twist is a little predictable, a little played out, and sort of ho-hum in its idea, the execution of the reveal sequence is brilliant. The editing and acting converge to form some of the best suspense sequences I've seen in a very long time.  Once the movie does make its twist known, the last 40 minutes of the film devolves into a crazy, bloody, unbelievable chase threw the woods. If the first hour passed by feeling like 30 minutes (which it does), then these last 40 go by feeling like 15. I was surprised that it had been 40 straight minutes of fighting and chasing, because it went by so fast. The movie takes a probable route in its action and horror in the last act, and there are some truly gross-out shots that some of the more brutal horror movies couldn't pull off. In part, it's the subtlety that makes it so effective. When someone gets their hand literally split in two, it doesn't dwell on how it was done, but just shows you, in less than five seconds, what has happened, and it's far more effective than any of the \\"Saw\\" movies. There are no extended scenes of murder or torture, just action sequences on crack. Timothy Olyphant has the best role in the movie, and that extends to the climax, where he kicks some serious ass.  Unfortunately, not everything about the movie is great, or even good. The twist is predictable, but the execution saves it. There was also something that happened in the final moments that I took to be another, smaller, twist, and that felt rushed and, on the flip side, was poorly executed. The couple played by Hemsworth and Shelton have no weightin the movie. They have a few small scenes, and then leave the movie. They are only there to provide a red-herring, and it feels like a cheat to the audience, and also strips the movie of two other great characters. One character's quick turn around in the last scenes seems like it was only added as a reshoot, because the character has showed no signs of their attitude prior to that moment. There are also some scenes that make no sense after the twist, but if you think about them you can actually rationalize them, which is different than most movies of this kind. But ultimately, \\"A Perfect Getaway\\" is god escapist entertainment, and I would see it again and maybe even buy it. It's worth seeing just for Olyphant's menacing character and Zahn's first role that has some depth. It makes me think he could do more roles in thrillers or dramas. He was compelling. Jovovich, too, could benefit from being in more dramas. She's a good actress, and after seeing her on a recent talk show, seems like a genuinely nice person. The movie falters slightly a few times, including one big time during the climax, but otherwise it's a very good movie with better action that uses no CGI, and is by far more exciting than the big summer blockbusters, like \\"GI Joe\\" and \\"Transformers 2\\". This movie should have been a big summer movie, but honestly, it's too good to be a summer blockbuster.
B002K0WBYG|4.0|'The Proposal' was a genuinely sweet, funny, and charming movie. Ryan Reynolds and Sandra Bullock, the film's two main stars, had some great chemistry that made all of their scenes together quite interesting. I must say, all of the actors turned into great contributions. Keep an eye for Malin Akerman (of Watchmen fame) and Oscar Nunez (part of The Office's stellar cast). Of course, this was a romantic comedy through and through- you could see the ending coming from just about the film's start. But that's really part of the fun, isn't it? 'The Proposal' was a laugh-out-loud hilarious movie with just the right amounts of charm and even a dash of drama. I have no doubts that the Blu-ray, with its included digital copy, won't disappoint.

If the code in your book has been used, the only option to get a viable code is to buy another book.  I bought a book that was supposed to be new.  The code had already been used and there is no recourse.
0525950079|5.0|I had read Pillars of the Earth by Ken Follett last year.  I have been looking for the sequel at a reasonable price and Amazon did it again.  The book was under $10.  I love it as much as Pillars of the Earth.
0743290127|1.0|Chick lit is what it is meant to be; light, fun and fast.  This was not.  It was too simple, no plot, no transitions from one story line to another and what bothered me the most was that these \\"best friends\\" were so jealous of each other's successes. In my world, these ladies are not true friends and I hate that women are potrayed in this way; so petty and small that we would begrudge our best friends' happiness.  I understand a little healthy envy but not straight out jealousy.  That made me want to stop reading it altogether, but I was on a 14-hour flight (and the only thing I had to read); it was what I had purchased thinking it would be a fun read a la Jennifer Weiner.  Oh well, can't win them all.  I would skip this one though, it's a waste of time, unless you are on a 14-hour flight with nothing else to read and no good movies on.
0061733199|4.0|This book is an essential. We have visited several jungles and plan to visit more and this book greatly reduces our risks. Even though we pack very light, we both carry a copy.
0385342020|5.0|I have read every single book of Sophie Kinsella. I love all shopaholic books, but didn't like 'Remember me' at all, I found the story too far-fetched, dragged out and boring.     So I was a little skeptical how I would like 'Twenties girl' - and decided to just rented the audio book instead of buying it.     Listening to it was a very pleasant surprise! My first impression after reading some reviews was 'oh no, another unbelievable story in the 'Remember me' style - but after a few chapters I was already addicted like I was with the Shopaholic books :o). And after hearing the whole story I even see family gatherings in a new light... You never know - your old aunt living in a nursing home might have an interesting story to tell - if you bother to listen.    The book is funny, entertaining, and the character Lara reminds me a lot of Shopaholic Becky. The story is fast-paced and has a couple of unpredictable twists, and shows one more time that 'good people' win at the end - at least a comforting thought.     If you like the Shopaholic books you will love Twenties girl too!
B001PPLIEG|4.0|the overuse of noise, flashy pyrotechnics, and violence coupled with a lack of character depth left me shaken, but not stirred.
B0021L8US0|1.0|I'm starting to truly believe that a large segment of the human race (mostly male) has a defective gene. This defective gene causes a love of gruesome violence and a total lack of concern for the suffering of others. This gene also promotes binary thinking - the guy with the white hat is good and the guy with the black hat is bad. There's no in-between. And if there is - who cares!<br /><br />A certain segment of Hollywood knows how to precisely exploit this genetic weakness and billions of dollars pour into their bank accounts. Telling a good story is a lost cause for this segment of the population. Show as much blood, guts, torture and torment as possible. It's such a formula recipe, it could be written on the back of a matchbook cover: Blood, guts, action = BILLIONS, year in, and year out! Why didn't I think of that?<br /><br />If you love oceans of blood, vomiting, heads and limbs popping off of bodies with regularity, a graphic torture chamber used for medical experiments and repeated attempts at cutting off someone's arm - then District 9 is for you! And there is also ZERO sexuality in this film. (Why am I not surprised?)<br /><br />The only reason I didn't walk out was because I wanted to see if the good guys were going to win in the end. I did actually care about the main characters and the gruesome violence made watching District 9 all that much sadder and annoying to watch.<br /><br />THIS NOT A FILM FOR CHILDREN!! If the images shown do not disturb your children, I suggest they need to get some help. THIS IS A WAR PORN MOVIE! It exploits the audience, plain and simple!<br /><br />Beside feeling sad, I felt empty when I left the theater. Lucky for me I was able to sneak into another movie and watch it for free. It showed only a single act of serious (and accidental) violence and that story was an absolute delight! Too bad Hollywood doesn't make more great movies that actually entertain instead of making films that are so depressing and annoying!<br /><br />For a MUCH more entertaining approach to Science Fiction see:[[ASIN:B000059HAE Zardoz]] and [[ASIN:B000059HAC Enemy Mine]] and [[ASIN:B000TZN7KQ Fantastic Planet]] and [[ASIN:B00003CXXP A.I. - Artificial Intelligence (Widescreen Two-Disc Special Edition)]] and [[ASIN:630587493X Bicentennial Man]] and [[ASIN:B001S86J0I Galaxy Quest (Deluxe Edition)]]<br /><br />Also see: [[ASIN:0335205054 Violence and the Media]] and [[ASIN:0452270057 Bad Movies We Love (Plume)]] and [[ASIN:0971835608 Reel Shame: Bad Movies and the Hollywood Stars Who Made Them]].ence Fiction see:[[ASIN:B000059HAE Zardoz]] and [[ASIN:B000059HAC Enemy Mine]] and [[ASIN:B000TZN7KQ Fantastic Planet]] and [[ASIN:B00003CXXP A.I. - Artificial Intelligence (Widescreen Two-Disc Special Edition)]] and [[ASIN:630587493X Bicentennial Man]] and [[ASIN:B001S86J0I Galaxy Quest (Deluxe Edition)]]    Also see: [[ASIN:0335205054 Violence and the Media]] and [[ASIN:0452270057 Bad Movies We Love (Plume)]] and [[ASIN:0971835608 Reel Shame: Bad Movies and the Hollywood Stars Who Made Them]].
B001M4YZ90|4.0|While it's no Lock, Stock and 2 Smoking Barrels or Snatch, this has a lot of good bits in it, particularly any scene with Mark Strong and Gerard Butler, playing the sort of roles Mel Gibson used to, before he went nuts and then pretentious.<br /><br />Recommended to fans of Ritchie's previous films, with the caveat that it's a lesser piece.
0783229364|5.0|The Secret Of My Success shows what someone with a backbone could accomplish under the most difficult of circumstances. What the Mathew J. Fox character tries to prevent in the film actually happened in real life to my father's multi-billion dollar corporation back in the 1980's! As a result, he, and tens of thousands of other people lost their jobs! Too bad they didn't have someone like the Michael J. Fox character attending their boardroom meetings! It might of saved a lot of people much grief!<br /><br />Beside the interesting story, the chemistry between the actors is fantastic! The soundtrack was one of the very few that's memorable. The sexual situations were plentiful and quite humorous! Parts of Connecticut look exactly like they were portrayed in the film! (Yes, there is a lot of mind-boggling wealth hidden down secluded country roads!) The Secret Of My Success is definitely a home run, and one of my all-time favorite comedies!<br /><br />See: [[ASIN:0307237354 Hostile Takeover: How Big Money and Corruption Conquered Our Government--And How We Take It Back]] and [[ASIN:0195044045 Knights, Raiders, and Targets: The Impact of the Hostile Takeover]]
0452295548|3.0|This book is Jill Bolte Taylor's story.  Dr.  Taylor is a brain scientist.  In her mid-thirties she had a major stroke.  What is cool about this book is that she describes her stroke to the reader as it is happening from a scientist's point of view.  She takes you step by step through the journey of her stroke as it happens.  She also takes the reader through the journey of recovery.  Personally, I am not sure how she survived the ordeal but she did!  As a life coach, I would highly recommend this book for health care workers and ask them to pay special attention to Appendix A & B.  I would also recommend it to family members and friends of stoke patients.  For the rest of us it is an insightful journey into the human mind.
B002DGRS5O|5.0|I came to this novel by way of a couple of Jane Austen movies and two failed attempts to read her books. The challenge was the vocabulary -- references to 'things' that no longer exist or for which I did not know the word. I don't mind research; I even enjoy it when I have the time and the proper resources. Actual, made-of-paper books were cumbersome to lug about and required a level of patience to mine that neither my employer, my family, nor I always had in abundance. Along came the Kindle with its built-in Oxford-American Dictionary. Don't know the meaning of 'devoirs', or what the 'scrape' is in 'bow and scrape'? just move the cursor to the word and the definition, usage, and history appears. Don't know what 'coquelicot' means? and don't see it in the Oxford-American Dictionary? then find it on Wikipedia, also accessible from the Kindle. Having pleasantly breezed through Northanger Abbey via Kindle, I look forward to savoring Jane Austen's other, longer works as well.
1594481717|5.0|This is a super cool book.  I would highly recommend this book to anyone in the business community and for non-profit organizations.  According to Mr. Pink our country is moving into the conceptual age and business as usual will be no more.  As a life coach, I would recommend this book to young people as they make decisions about education and careers.  AND to older adults who are thinking about their long-term career goals.  I really like this book!
B000002KOY|5.0|Crazy Horse is best known as Neil Young's backing group on such seminal records as \\"Everybody Know This is Nowhere,\\" \\"Zuma,\\" and \\"Ragged Glory.\\" For some, they're the ultimate garage band. This CD or album shows they were and are so much more. Danny Whitten, original leader and lead guitarist for the band, left this world much too soon and influenced Young on some of his less commercial albums. He left this document to showcase his genius, though.    Any fan of 60s rock, folk-rock, country-rock,or great music in general should get this album. The original version of \\"I Don't Want to Talk About It\\" cuts Rod Stewart's hit version to shreds, and that's just the tip of the iceberg on this disc. The Horse touches on many strands of music, and combines to make them their own on \\"Gone Dead Train,\\" and the Neil Young tune \\"Dance, Dance, Dance.\\" \\"Downtown\\" is another great tune, even if it is about heroin, as some sources say.    This disc is a great mix of music for fans of rock and roll. It's also a sad document of what might have been if Whitten hadn't given in to his demons. Crazy Horse is known as Neil Young's great backing band. This disc shows they had the potential for so much more. At least they have this as a document, and it, in some small way, is enough. This disc contains a lot of great music by a great band.
055380684X|4.0|I found this book interesting on how the author describes how talent isn't born but grows.  The basic concept is that if we love an activity and do it enough very slowly we build \\"myelin\\" in the brain.  Myelin is the key to both good and bad habits.  As a life coach, I can use this concept with clients who want to break a habit.  Mr. Coyle suggests that we don't break bad habits but rather create new behaviors.  We do that by laying new Myelin tracks.   This is a great resource for teachers and coaches.  If you like to learn how the brain works then you will love this book.  If you don't give a hoot then perhaps you should select something else to read.
B0000029AP|5.0|This remaster sounds better than the original.  It has better balanced sound.  The original cd lacked high frequencies.  This one has the proper amount of treble and sounds cleaner and clearer.  I highly recommend it to all Aerosmith fans.
1416914307|5.0|This series had everything-- epic adventure, epic battles, even epic love (of the romantic, friendship, and family kind)! I simply could not put it down. The heroes (Clary, Jace, Simon, the Lightwoods, Magnus, Luke) are all [...] and strong, and yet also reveal shades of vulnerability that make it easy for me to sympathize with them. The myth of the Nephilim is interesting, and I was thoroughly caught up in the world that the author created. Though the plot was a tad predictable at times, it was also complex enough to keep me wondering and engaged throughout the series. All in all, a very satisfying and enjoyable read. Looking forward to the author's next series.
B001IAOEXU|5.0|While I'm not a fan of the DualShock 3 controller design/layout as a whole (the Xbox 360 controller is superior), the RealTriggers are a huge help. They make the PlayStation 3 controller much more enjoyable to use for extended play sessions. Sony should buy out the company that makes these and incorporate their design into a revamp of the DualShock controller. The RealTriggers are that good.
B000WLIEKK|4.0|When I bought this CD, I had no idea this was Creed members with new singer. I am not a Creed fan, and I'm glad I didn't know until after.  I may have had 2nd thoughts at the time.  However, this band has a punch and a bite.  The song Ties That Bind simply kicks arse.  Possibly the best rock album of the year.
B00275EGX8|5.0|One of the year's best films, this follows a team of GIs in Iraq whose job is to defuse and/or detonate potential bombs. Incredibly taut and scary, particularly when you think about the fact that there are hundreds of soldiers still doing this same job right now.<br /><br />As a side note - I was on a whale watch this week and started talking with the volunteer naturalist, Jason. He had just come back from two tours in Iraq, doing this exact job. He said that of 198 men in his outfit, 196 had been wounded. (Including himself - 90% deaf in one ear from an IED blast.) He also said that the outfit was now being re-deployed to Afghanistan. I asked him if he has seen 'The Hurt Locker' yet, and he hadn't; but a lot of his comrades had, and they all raved about it. That alone should be enough of an endorsement - see this movie!!!
006135323X|5.0|This book is educational about how people make decisions and it is well written and entertaining to read.
B001FB55I0|4.0|Boy, this got hammered by most critics. But I don't know what the problem was - I know it's pretty grim from start of finish, and it doesn't have the humor of the earlier Terminator flicks. But I thought this was really well done, and that both Christian Bale and especially Sam Worthington did a fine job, the story moved along quickly for a 2-hour movie, and there were enough twists and turns to keep me interested throughout. Besides, how can you not love a movie who's leading babe is named Moon Bloodgood (REAL name, not her character!)I think it was unfairly maligned because of the high budget and Bale's on-set rant; but taken as a straight sci-fi action movie, it's pretty darn good!
B0008ENHUI|4.0|I had fond memories of seeing this film when it first came out. I recently read the book Papillon, & wanted to see it again. Obviously, the book is better. I dig McQueen, & Hoffman does a good job here, too. It's well-worth the price.
B001FB55H6|1.0|This action movie sins in the worst possible way - it's boring! There's no sense of fun anywhere (see 'Iron Man'), and the action sequences are dull and predictable (has no one seen the 'Kill Bill' movies? They came out years ago!). Even the acting was pretty stilted - I thought Rorschach was pretty decent, but everyone else was bland, bland, bland.<br /><br />I dunno - maybe it doesn't help that I never read the comic book (excuse me, \\"graphic novel\\"). I wonder if this is what it was like for outsiders to watch 'Lord of the Rings'? In which, for me, it was ultra-cool to all my favorite characters come to life, and I loved every entrance and how faithful it was to the book; I was just overwhelmed. Maybe this movie does that for 'Watchmen' fans, I dunno. But for me, I couldn't wait for the end.<br /><br />(The disparity between die-hard fans and everyone else might also explain why the IMDB rating is a very high 7.9, but metacritic is significantly lower at 56)
B001SC9G5O|5.0|I could not stop reading this book once I started, because it is really entertaining, and for someone with my backgroud it is an \\"eye-openner\\".<br /><br />This book gives you a different view of things in life, in terms that we never take into account: the randomness in many of the events and situations in life. Like getting rich being a trader.<br /><br />Nissim explains how out of mere luck and the number of traders participating in a market (as he puts it: let's say 10,000), 313 will win from trading in each of a five year sequence; just out of mere luck!!!<br /><br />I also learned how we tend to think that our failures are a product of randomness, but not our successes.<br /><br />I have an industrial and systems engineering undergraduate degree and I felt I was the one writing about many of the things he was. I am also a chocolate addict.[[ASIN:B001SC9G5O Fooled by Randomness]][[ASIN:1400063515 The Black Swan: The Impact of the Highly Improbable]]<br /><br />What also impresses me is the combination of his background: derivatives trader - philosopher - statistician.<br /><br />You need to read this book to have a different view of how not to envy your rich neighbor.
B00288KNJU|3.0|Awesome visuals dominate this movie, but I wasn't totally enthralled with it. The lead character of Coraline wasn't really all that nice, and it was hard to cheer for her, or even like her very much. I thought the only standout character was the 'Other Mother', voiced by Teri Hatcher (who oddly enough did the real mother as well, but that was less interesting to me).
0316017922|1.0|I just don't get the popularity of this guy. I'm so glad I listened to this book instead of reading it or it would have ended in the middle where I left Tipping Point and Blink. As it is I still wondered how anyone can drag out so many pieces of trivia and get paid to do it.    If I believed all that he wrote I would be depressed knowing that there is no hope for the rest of the world because we didn't fall within his findings.     Don't bother reading this, try to listen to it when you need to sleep - guaranteed to do the trick.
0451207521|2.0|1.  I've heard a lot of good things about Ken Follett and was looking forward to this book.<br /><br />2.  Bottomline: it's not a bad book, but nothing significant beyond an average \\"ok\\" book.  Translation:  I don't feel any need or inspiration to get another Ken Follett book.
0307278255|2.0|I believe it's usually one of 2 reasons: either the topic does not interest you, or the story in itself is dull.  In my case it's the second reason.  While I was very interested in reading the experiences of people whose culture I don't really know, I found the stories to be very very dull. Sure, life experiences can be dull or full of emotion, however, as said by a previous review, the characters seem to never achieve a level of neither a good positive experience or a bad enough experience so that some excitement is transmitted to the reader.  That kind of excitement that causes the reader not to be able to put down the book.  It's like a good lullaby song, it puts me to sleep.
0307460444|1.0|This is the first Martha Stewart cookbook I've purchased, and it is also the last: style triumps over substance here. The recipe for devil's food cupcakes failed miserably on several counts, not the least of which is a bland chocolate flavor instead of the deep, rich taste you expect from devil's food. When reading the recipe over before starting to cook, I thought it looked strange, but decided to go ahead and try it.  I ended up running out and buying a cake for a special occasion.
B00005JLRT|5.0|Was going to rent this movie, but Amazon had it listed for cheeper than the rental price, even with the shipping.  Now I will always have it.

Please note, that I will only buy from sellers with a hight percentage rating, even if I have to pay a little more for one.
B00127RAJY|5.0|I've actually not been a follower of \\"The Biggest Loser\\" but I now am a firm believer in how she is able to get 400 lb. people committed to losing weight and gaining muscle.  I have exercised off and on over the years and really am more interested in gaining a lifestyle change that I can stick with versus a hardcore workout that is too intense. Her attitude of giving me 20 minutes a day is superb! While building muscle she is urging our bodies to lose weight through increasing our heartrate. I would gladly encourage all body types and lifestyles in trying this workout video.  You can't go wrong!
B000E1ZBGS|3.0|With the exception of the 1940 Greer Garson version that had the Bennet girls dressed as Bo Peep, this has to be one of the poorest versions of P&P that I've seen.  Why?  The cameraman couldn't get his eyes off Keira Knightley. In the big watershed moments, we go to a larger than life close up of Ms. Knightley and then to a distant view of Mr. Darcy.  How can we feel the strength of the scene that way? Matthew Macfadyen never stood a chance as Darcy.   Too bad. We never really got to see him.

B0012E6R3W|1.0|When I first bought this album not too long after it was released I listened to it pretty regularly for a couple of weeks or so. I thought then as I do now that despite a few issues it was a solid Testament release that I'd enjoy for years to come. So why now over a year after its release do I find myself not able to recall the last time I listened to it?<br />It's because this record is just another unfortunate victim of what many in and out of the music industry term the loudness wars.<br /><br />Now in this case I'm not sure if this is totally the fault of the mastering job done here or if the instruments themselves were just recorded too close to zero db. I would guess it's a combination of both. It all adds up to a record that is overly loud with everything at the same volume and just fatiguing to listen to. This just plain sucks because I like the music contained here.<br /><br />So now you say, hey you idiot this is metal, it's supposed to be loud! What are you, some kind of stupid audio snob? Nobody can even hear what you're talking about!<br />For an even more current example just take a look at the discussion on the net surrounding the newest Metallica album. You'll find many people giving these same complaints. When metal-heads start to complain about overly loud albums with clipping and distortion, you know something is up.

0790731452|5.0|All the movie stereotypes and cliches with the most talented cast and the most horrible (and humorous) Martians.<br /><br />OK, so it doesn't involve deep introspection or have profound artistic meaning.  It was still a riot.  Martians invade Earth, and all the foibles of mankind are on display.  Politicians, trailer parks, self-absorbed scientists, Las Vegas, the military, and the inner city all figure in the human response to the Martian invasion.  Humanity is done for, unless they can find a weapon that will defeat the DaDaesque cruelties of the Martians!<br /><br />This could have been a complete flop, but with Jack Nicholson (in several roles), Glenn Close, Pierce Brosnan, Pam Grier, Sarah Jessica Parker, Michael J. Fox, and other first rate actors under Tim Burton's direction, this one came together beautifully.  Not for the kids, with bizarre alien experiments, rampent lust, and hilarious violence, this will overwhelm younger kids, but is just right for a normal teens' sensibilities.<br /><br />The best vignette from the whole move is in the midst of the Martian carnage, one Martian carries a translator box that quips \\"Don't run.  We are your friends.  We come in peace.\\"<br /><br />First rate fun for more robust viewers.<br /><br />E. M. Van Court
B000002U82|5.0|This ambient, mysterious album sounds just as fresh as it did in 1973. Waters' lyrics are deep and meaningful, and Gilmour's solos are jaw-dropping. But whats amazing about this album is how coherent it is. Each track seems to flow right into the next, and I couldn't imagine the order of the songs being different. The sound effects (like the clinking of coins in Money and the chiming of clocks in Time) really add to atmosphere of the music. Really incredible work, here.  This is when Floyd acheived perfection.
B000000WA4|5.0|While all of Smashing Pumpkin's albums are good, none of them can even hold a flame to this great work.  In my opinion this ties with Pearl Jam's \\"Ten\\" for the best rock album of the 90s spot.  \\"Bodies\\" is a great song, the hardest tune on the CD, and it's followed by the great \\"33\\", the softest tune on the album.  It takes a special magic to pull that one off the stunning way in which they did, but those are just two of the many gems on this album.  The Smashing Pumpkins are known as a hard rock band and definetely due in no small part to some of the songs on this album, but that isn't the end-all be-all to this group.  So be sure to give it a listen from beginning to end, it's mainly filled with beautiful soft gems, and if that's what you treasure then prepare for an enchanted evening.

B001GKJ2DY|5.0|If you like musicals you will love this one - I could not believe that all of the actors could sing.  I am glad that they actually had the actors sing the songs - it was great and i watch this one over and over.  I love the music so I went out and purchased the sound track.
B001GKJ2DO|5.0|I had no desire to see this movie and caught it changing channels.  It was the opening scene and my remote was like a car slamming on the brakes.  To heck with all critics, this movie will make you smile.  It is an interlude of contagious fun and in times like these we desperately need this!  I thought all the actors were great.  It wasn't the quailty of their singing that mattered (which was great) but the abandon with which they totally jumped into the characters.  Brosnan was adorable.  You WILL smile.
B000K7VHH8|2.0|I am only going to review the Blu Ray disc. The image quality is poor, most occasions it's blurred. Especially when the film starts I end up wondering why it gets blurred.<br />I had the same issue with Die Hard 1 and 2 and In the Line Of Fire. Why do I get the feeling the they just transferring the image from dvd to Blu Ray or using some type of Noise Reduction which actually worsens the picture quality,
0805211063|4.0|The Castle is one of those rare works of fiction that one can choose to interpret however one sees fit. That being said, the central theme of the book seems to be bureaucracy - but not bureaucracy for bureaucracy's sake, but rather, how bureaucracy affects all the characters in the novel, chiefly the lone figure of K.<br /> I read the novel as something of a commentary on modern life:<br />  The main character K. arrives in a completely foreign village, knowing nothing of local custom or etiquette.<br />  K. strives to do only one thing; begin work as a land surveyor, his chosen occupation. But In order to do so, he must appeal to officials at the castle.<br /> K. quickly becomes the one being appeased, as the officials offer him a post in a completely unrelated field, he falls for a barmaid, and is inundated on all sides by local affairs - all the while never giving up on his dream, only becoming more weary and worn.<br /> Could this possibly be social commentary on the absurdities of modern living, on the world we've built for ourselves? How it is exceedingly difficult, sometimes nearly impossible, to do the things which should be most simple - chiefly, doing what your want for a living and surviving by your own merit? A task made difficult through the fettering hands of authorities and our complete and utter dependence on them.<br /> Kafka's narrative style is a little hard to digest at first - there are many passages that seem like run-on sentences, and many times characters venture complex, lengthy monologues in order to explain themselves and their situations - but upon cozying up, one eventually finds it endearing. There are also moments of profound insight that seem only all the more brilliant because of the somewhat \\"tedious\\" nature of the rest of the prose. I found myself marking passages. Throughout the work, an unreal, dreamlike quality persists, as if Kafka were himself writing in a trance.<br /> Is the book good? Yes. Worth reading? Yes. Challenging at times? Yes. Ultimately rewarding - of course. Kafka manages to build a world full of such intriguing characters, with so many varied and competing self-interests, and an enduring, central, \\"underdog\\" character, that I couldn'g help wishing that the novel didn't end mid-sentence...I couldn't help longing for more.times?

B00288KNLS|4.0|CORALINE is by far the best example of stop motion I've ever seen.  While the look of [[ASIN:B001AIRUOU The Nightmare Before Christmas]] wears with time, this is just perfectly smooth.  The colors are beautiful and the movement is gracious.  The film itself is disturbing in all the good ways, and the story is surprisingly dark and creepy considering it's essentially a children's movie.  The best way I can describe the feel of CORALINE is this.  Imagine if a creepier version of Pixar, known for making intelligent movies with strong themes that are thought-provoking for adults but still accessible for children, made a stop-motion flick.    A lot of fans, ignorant to the fact that Tim Burton PRODUCED [[ASIN:B001AIRUOU The Nightmare Before Christmas]], not directed it, will be fooled by the \\"from the director of [[ASIN:B001AIRUOU The Nightmare Before Christmas]]\\" label on this film.  So it will definitely get the Burton crowd.  But, by and large, the story and visuals are superior to Burton's work.  Since it's adapted from Neil Gaiman's popular book, which I unfortunately didn't get a chance to read before I saw the film, you know you can trust to be told a delightfully creepy tale.  The movie does find a nice balance between keeping the visuals stunning and maintaining the integrity of Gaiman's story.    So far, this seems like a glowing review.  It's coming out that way because the film definitely has a lot going for it.  The animation deserves praise, the script is good, and the voice acting (which I haven't mentioned) is also great.  But, even at one-hundred minutes, this film feels way too long.  I was bored in parts, and felt that the movie could have lost fifteen minutes without losing a shred of its complexity.  I still enjoyed it, and wouldn't mind seeing it again.  Not sure if it's worth owning on DVD unless you're a huge animation fan or really dig Gaiman's work, but it's at least worth a rent!    7/10
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I find it hard to believe that Fox actually canceled this show.  Everything comes together so perfectly and that is rare on TV today.  I recently had a chance to watch this show on Hulu and was immediately drawn in. Compared to all the garbage on TV today this was a gem.  I don't watch TV much anymore...most of the programming is so very bad. The movie was good too and I would hope that they would make another...again considering all the crap movies put out by studios today Firefly would be a HUGE step up.

B001FBSMW6|3.0|This is far too developed to be their pop-induced write-off as its been claimed, but the songwriting's emotional heft does tend to take a beating when more in this uptempo frame. Easily listenable but simply a logical progression from their previously-becoming-bland sophomore.
0312370849|3.0|I wanted to like this book, I really did. But at the end of it I realized that I felt more attached with Sarah, a secondary character that is dropped halfway through the book then I did to the primary character, a character that I can't even remember the name of now. About the only thing I can say about this book is that I learned a piece of French history that I was not aware of and that I want to explore more. For that, I am grateful that I read the book.

However, I found this book a huge let down because it is far too derivative of the original and the main character Mother Caris is difficult to empathize with whereas the character of Gwenda is far more interesting and could've held my attention had her story been more deeply developed.

B0009U5DD0|5.0|I saw the Gipsy Kings in St. Louis, Mo very recently and were disappointed they didn't have any cd's for sale.  I immediately went on Amazon.com and purchased several of their cd's, including this one.  Their music is very uplifting!  At their concert, it was impossible to stay seated ... people were dancing in front of their seats, in the aisles, and in front of the stage.  It was incredible!  Their music is like none other I've ever heard.  This cd contains many songs that will have you tapping your feet, and have you wanting to dance no matter where you are.  It's impossible to stay \\"still\\".  They are an extremely talented group of musicians!  Awesome cd!  Priced at a bargain!  I would buy any of their cds.

B0025X4P24|5.0|What can I say other than this album is a true masterpiece. Vanessa has been gone from the music scene for a while and it is so wonderful to have her back and to have her back with such a powerful and truly moving collection is beyond words. I absolutely love every song on this album - each for different reasons but as a whole it truly touches my soul and to me that is a mark of a truly great album and a truly great artist. My absolute favorites are the current single \\"Just Friends\\" and \\"I Fell In\\" and \\"Breathless\\" but the entire album is so wonderful I'm just in heaven each time I play it. Vanessa's vocal ability is still amazing and she sounds better than ever. So I highly recommend this collection to old and new fans alike. Bring \\"The Real Thing\\" home and into your hearts. You won't regret it.
B0021L8US0|5.0|This is a truly incredible film that I enjoyed thoroughly.  The story is very creative and the way it plays out visually is a wonder to behold. The aliens(prawns)are presented painstakingly well and anyone who talks about how cheesy they look has little idea of how much hard work and care goes into breathing life into characters like this in film. I was greatly impressed with this movie and look forward to more from this director.
1580176941|5.0|I read cookbooks like novels -- absolutely love to sit down with a good cookbook and read through the recipes. That said, this is not really a cookbook, but rather a beautifully illustrated, clearly written and well-researched \\"how to beautifully decorate your cookies\\" book. For those people without favorites of their own, included are basic recipes for cut-out cookies, but the subject matter is how-to-create visually stunning cookies.  And, with the help of this book, anyone can do it.<br /><br />The author's are generous with real-world tips learned from their vast cookie decorating experience. There is information regarding the best way to roll out the cookies -- roll dough directly onto parchment paper and cut out cookies 1/2 inch apart - remove surrounding dough and put parchment paper directly on cookie sheet. Simply brilliant, no transferring and distorting of the cut-out cookies. No extra flour on the cutting board so the dough doesn't stick which results in dry, less tasty cookies. I tried their method and it works perfectly.<br /><br />They include their preferred ways to bake the cookies, and how to practice decorating styles. Knowing how little time most of us have, they include short-cuts on making cookies in advance -- whether preparing and storing unbaked batches of cookie dough or actually baking and freezing undecorated cookies (their preference.) Splitting the baking and the decorating tasks allows the decorating to take center stage and be done when there is plenty of time to devote to the activity. The decorating process may be enjoyed rather than rushing through it.<br /><br />They share the best tools to use from start to finish including details like what works best for flooding royal icing onto a cookie with piped borders -- squeeze bottles (like hair coloring applicator bottles.) That is something I would never have tried, but like the parchment paper tip, is a suggestion I will use every time. The book is packed-full of wonderful information that makes cookie decorating easy with results that look complex and impressive. You don't have to be an expert to look like you are one. This book is a keeper -- not one of those cookbooks you look through and put on the shelf. This one will be used again and again and is an invaluable reference to those readers interested in creating beautiful cookies.corating easy with results that look complex and impressive.

B001TH16DS|5.0|Never been to a convention but have been a huge fan of Star Trek since the first broadcast in 1966.  Season 1 on blu-ray is outstanding.  For purists you can watch the original special effects and listen to the original sound track.  But if you are daring enough to \\"Boldly go where no man (in this case) has gone before\\" you will re-experience Star Trek.  The film had been cleaned up extraordinarily well and enhanced.  The special effects do the kind of justice that this series deserves.  The sound track extraordinary.  I plan to purchase season 2 (available 9/22/09) and season 3 as available.

B002DKGWSE|1.0|I couldn't wait for the remake of Last House on the Left to go to video.  Last night I finally got to watch it.  I didn't really expect anything as edgy as the original but all things considered I did expect something more believable.  The only good thing I can say about this movie is that production value was much better.  That means the sound and video quality were better then the original.  It was also good to get rid of that awful music and what I think was supposed to be comic relief in the form of depicting the cops as idiots from the original movie.    I didn't expect the original script to be tightly followed.  It would have been nice to at least follow the basics.  There were parts that Wes obviously didn't want from the original.  If he didn't want the terrorizing of the girls then fine.  He should have gotten rid of the rape scene entirely.  Most people would take her clothes off if he were going to do that.  As it was, there was nothing in that part of the remake that made sense.  They tried very hard to make this politically correct and sanitize it to death.  The original was much more realistic.  After three stab wounds most people would be bleeding profusely but not here.  Any blood is left for the struggle at the end except for the blood spilled in the river from the gun shot.    The acting was atrocious with the exception of the girl who survived a gunshot in the water and managed to swim up river until she could make it home.  The bad guys girlfriend was pretty good in her fight scene also.  The bad guy looked like he walked off a soap opera set where he played a pretty boy.  There was nothing pretty about David Hess.  David was very convincing as a psychopath.  All of the original characters were convincing.  Hess was exceptional.    If you absolutely have to see this movie, because the original was so good that this one can't really be that bad, then I suggest waiting 2 months.  Then you will be able to find it in the $4.99 discounted DVD's in Walmart.  They have spent more money advertising this pile of excrement than they used to make the entire original movie.    Personally I'm just glad I got two brand new kittens to entertain me or the entire two hours would have been wasted.

0385333846|5.0|One of the best things I learned in college was the name Kurt Vonnegut.  His voice is uniquely his own and always worthy of the investment in the time to listen to.  Slaughterhouse Five definitely is a work that all should invest the time to read.  Personally, I think it should be read a couple of times over one's life to understand the collective and individual ravages of war.    A favorite scene of mine in the movie Back to School is when Rodney Dangerfield tells Vonnegut in a cameo appearance that he doesn't know a thing about Vonnegut.  This is why I love Slaughterhouse Five.  There are so many concepts presented here that everyone will interpret the elements of the book differently.    - Does Billy Pilgrim time travel or is he trapped in his mind from the horrors he has experienced?  - Is his time travel a copping mechanism from the dismay of being a POW?  - Is war just to be accepted as a natural event that should be ignored as the Tralfamadorians do or should we not accepted it and fight against it because as humans with free will we have the inherent capabilities to stop it?  - Do we have free will?  - Are we a more dangerous a people with atomic weapons when we proved capable of killing 135,000 people in Dresden and 84,000 in Tokyo with fire-bombing while killing only 71,000 in Hiroshima with an atomic bomb?  - Who is worse, the soldiers who killed innocent people and turned their body fat into candles or those who boiled the soldiers innocent children in the fire-bombing of a safe-city?  Is revenge sweet as Lazzaro implies?  If so, why did he not revel in the bombing of Dresden?  - Why do we allow children to fight our wars?    The list of questions to contemplate from this book can go on and on.    Again, to me Slaughterhouse Five definitely is worth reading a few times over one's life.  Billy Pilgrim, unremarkable Billy Pilgrim, is a character worthy of note in the annals of literature.  The seamless presentation of a timeless, though disjointed, story of Billy's life  is exceptional.  Everyone will have their own interpretation of the themes.  To paraphrase from the book, here is light opera being played by crippled human beings, more fools like ourselves.    [One quick negative point, I read the smaller sized Dell paperback, which had terrible typesetting.]

Have attempted them all, sometimes more than twice (MD took how many times to finally finish? And AD still isn't done). This is the FIRST Pynchon novel I've ever gotten through in one go. Enjoyable, rollicking (never thought I'd use that word in a sentence, thanks Thomas!), and ending nicely on a search for meaning amidst the fog of reality. In fact, this book is capable of appealing to so many different types of readers that I've even recommended it to my mother (who sounded intrigued when I gave her a plot summary). Darn good reading, a worthy way to end the summer. Now, if I can still make it through AD someday.

0307473473|3.0|After writing Blood Feud and the Lauren Maxwell mysteries, I was burned out on mysteries, crime novels and thrillers so I haven't read many in the past ten years. Then I saw a two-for-$10 paperback sale at a local store and found two titles that interested me on the book table: Stieg Larsson's The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo and Julia Child's My Life in France. Despite having a stack of two dozen must-reads, I plunged right in to Julia (that'll give you an idea of where my head is these days)and zoomed through that before heading north to Sweden for Larsson's 2007 blockbuster. I zoomed through Dragon Tattoo as well, even though at 644 pages I thought it was too long by at least a quarter and maybe a third. The story was complex enough to keep me interested and the setting in Sweden quite refreshing. But from the moment \\"pierced and tattooed punk prodigy Lisbeth Salander\\" arrived on the scene, something about her nagged at me. Not until we reached the end of the book, with a couple of pages of dense gibberish about computer hacking, did I remember Kathleen Mallory, the central character of nine crime novels written by Carol O'Connell beginning with Mallory's Oracle in 1994. [[ASIN:0515116475 Mallory's Oracle (Kathleen Mallory Novels)]] Mallory's background is every bit as horrific as Lisbeth's, her unusual intelligence every bit as brilliant and her personality every bit as prickly. Given the fact that Larsson's other character, Mikael Blomkvist, is frequently found reading American and British crime novels, it's a good bet that author has also read O'Connell's books. If you liked The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, you should too. Lisbeth Salander is a fitting homage to O'Connell's unusual protagonist, but Mallory is the original.<br />[...]

Part of my 'devotion' here is due to the idea behind Dr. Horrible, in the wake of industry nonsense; but the rest is because it's just a hell of a lot of fun.<br /><br />While this disc won't make it into anybody's Reference collection for audio or video, it should certainly be there for comedy and kitsch. The only thing I would like to have differently is to have Commentary! be recorded in a bit higher resolution for clarity.<br /><br />I love this show for what it is - an experiment in challenging the 'system' and still having a blast. Awesome.

Rocky is a tender film about an underdog boxer who gets a chance to fight heavyweight champ, Apollo Creed. Talia Shire's beloved character, Adrian is so shy and nervous in this film, thank goodness she loosened up in Rocky 2. This film was a labor of love for Stallone, such a touching and rewarding film, enjoy!

B001N26GFM|5.0|I knew I would hate THE BOY IN THE STRIPED PAJAMAS - but I knew I had to see it.  I finally did.  I sat on the edge of a chair for the entire viewing and shivered at what has happened and what could so easily happen again.  I remember seeing SCHINDLER'S LIST (1993),  walking out saying to my husband, \\"We must see that all of our grandchildren have a copy of this before we die.\\"      Somehow you don't want to remember these things that must never be forgotten!      At the end of THE BOY IN THE STRIPED PAJAMAS, I did not speak and could not think.  It took perhaps 48 hours before I could \\"begin\\" to think clearly.  I cannot tell you the end - it would be wrong - but you must see it.  And, right after I purchase SCHINDLER'S LIST for all 15 of our grandchildren, I will need to purchase another 15 copies of THE BOY IN THE STRIPED PAJAMAS.      Saint Ambrose of Milan once said:  \\"Not only for every idle word, but for every idle silence shall we be called to account.\\"  These two movies mentioned here need to be in every library known to man.

It was filled with action from start to finish and romance that gave me goosebumps =) If you are buying this for your teenager I would say some of the situations are more adult than others, nothing graphic when it comes to romance but the fighting can get gruesome and some of the family issues are complex in nature. I am 26 and it was PERFECT for a light summer read. I have passed them on to my co-workers at work and they are all raving as well! It's become the talk of the office!

B001QAT4UK|5.0|These two books came quickly and in perfect shape.  I got THE MISTS  OF AVALON from the library and after reading about 10 pages, I HAD  TO HAVE MY OWN COPY.    Every woman should read this book! For starters, find out how Christianity wiped out the recognition and influence of GODDESSES, putting them to death as witches, and causing women to be reduced to little more than chattel.  That's what got my attention.  I went for the two-fer deal including THE FOREST HOUSE, which I   think should be read first.

B00003CWL6|5.0|From the first scene I knew this movie was a winner. American Beauty has the right mix a raunchiness, wit, and humor to make it a true classic.
0307269981|5.0|I have both this book and the previous The Girl With the Dragon Tatoo and am looking forward to the next one. But I must say that I truly miss Stieg Larsson. His writing is really, really good. The way he interweaves plots and characters is excellent and the footnotes in this book are helpful in gaining a historical perspective. Hopefully there are others in Sweden who are also rocking the boat of politics because politics like life should never be smooth sailing.
0307454541|3.0|Many people made this book out to be really amazing truly original writing and plot. It was really captivating and it was hard to put down but honestly it was like reading a long episode of Law and Order SVU: Sweden. Good mystery read but nothing really unique.
B00007KQA3|1.0|The movie was basically awful, while the book revealed some real truths that happen when a society is taken in bondage by its evil government, wanting to change all truth into lies, whether that be history or morality, etc, all through THOUGHT CONTROL. Some may see this happening in America now, read the book and see if you see the similarities. But the movie was awful, it took forever to even begin to reveal the slightest hint of what the story was about, and then left you still wondering. Nothing much was made clear, and the movie seemed to focus more on sensual stimulation thru nudity than dealing with what the story was all about, a nation's calling good evil and evil good and forcing its subjects to believe it.   To me, the movie is very slow moving and boring as far as the real story is concerned.  I see this movie as a serious waste of time. It really disappointed me, and I wonder whether it would disappoint George Orwell as well.  I believe the whole point was just missed in the movie, and it was hard to see any point at all.  (The book is just the opposite, I would highly recommend that everyone read it.)
1932100660|2.0|This is one of the most poorly written books I have seen.  It could have been written in 1/10 the amount of words.  It is very flowery with tremendous amounts of useless background and extraneous information and just verbage.  The book can be summed-up in one line:  Eat fruits and vegetables (plant based foods), do not eat animal proteins (meat), and do not eat dairy products.
1594481717|4.0|My Purpose in Reading The Book:   An ongoing interest in understanding how human beings think. There are plenty of these types of books out there, but I thought A Whole New Mind would provide an interesting lens, since it's primary perspective was in application to business and the market place.     The Good:   Pink does an excellent job of summarizing some key research and ideas with regards to right/left hemisphere functioning. He also draws some interesting implications for business and surviving in the \\"new\\" marketplace. I also appreciate the emphasis on a \\"whole\\" brain approach. The book works well as an introduction to such topics, especially for those of us that live in our cubicles. At the very least, it may help inspire some of us to further delve into the topic in other texts.    The Not So Great:  First let me say that I think the book does a great job in doing what it sets out to do. However, though Pink does give us tips on how to exercise our \\"right-brain\\" faculties, the writing itself only excercises the \\"left-brain.\\" If readers of \\"A Whole New Mind\\" are daring enough to exercise both sides of their brain, I highly suggest taking the next step and checking out [[ASIN:1442190507 The Power of Thinking Differently: An imaginative guide to creativity, change, and the discovery of new ideas.]]
B000096I9G|5.0|The Kiss is one of my favorite Cure songs so I was excited that it was included in the encore.  It didn't disappoint.  As for the three main sets, I enjoyed Pornography the best (that album continues to find ways to surprise and astonish me) but Disintegration and Bloodflowers were also top-notch.    Essential just for the experience of having all three albums together and the price is extremely reasonable.
B001GATF7M|4.0|This is a very good creepy movie. It has a classic look to it. A woman named Mary Henry survives a car accident, and after that, she starts seeing a deformed, ghoulish figure,(who directed the movie) Sometimes, it seems like she is dead to the world because she can't hear and no one else can see or hear her. There is one part where we think she is talking to a psychiatrist about what's been happening to her, the doctor's chair turns around and it's really that ghoulish man. Later, she ends up at an abandoned carnival and the ghouls try to take her. I like the colorized version of the film because it makes it better and creepier and realistic! If you love classic horror, you'll love CARNIVAL OF SOULS!!!

B000B8QEZG|5.0|Not only is this one of Madonna's best album's of her career, it's one of the best album's of it's genre. This is an album Madonna fans & dance music lovers alike, can all enjoy. There is also some sampling going on throughout the record, from ABBA's &#34;Gimme Gimme Gimme&#34; on &#34;Hung Up&#34;, and the Jackson 5 smash &#34;Can U Feel It&#34; on &#34;Sorry.&#34; There's also a throwback sample of Madonna's own hit in &#34;Push&#34;, as well as &#34;Jump.&#34; Now, &#34;Jump&#34; doesn't actually sample anything, but it's a definite throwback to hits & fan favorites like &#34;Express Yourself&#34; &#34;Deeper and Deeper&#34; & &#34;Vogue&#34;, containing similar elements in it's lyrics, rhythm, and bassline, and is strongly influenced by the club sound of the late 80's, early 90's.<br /><br />&#34;Get Together&#34;, &#34;Sorry&#34;, &#34;I Love New York&#34; & &#34;How High&#34; are what I was drawn to immediately. Everyone I know who owns this Album sings &#34;Get Together&#34; in acappella as if to be a radio hit, and goes down on my personal list of faves of Madonna favorites.<br /><br />Oh! and let me just say that the Album Artwork is just divine, her hair colour on this album along with the pink top & shoes are so stylish & hot!<br /><br />I'm keeping this review as short as possible otherwise it will be too lengthy.

B001CZJKS0|5.0|HALLOWEEN- I can't even begin to tell you how much I love this film! In my opinion, HALLOWEEN is without a doubt, one of the best movies ever made! I love everything about it! I love that it takes place on HALLOWEEN! I love all the characters; especially Michael Myers, Dr. Loomis, and Laurie Strode. I love the mood and atmosphere! It has a classic horror story of a psychopath breaking out of Smith's Grove Sanitarium the night before HALLOWEEN and the next day, returns to Haddonfield, Illinois and goes on a rampage and stalks three friends named Laurie, Annie, and Lynda. Dr. Loomis tries to stop Michael from killing anyone, but it's already too late. Laurie is babysitting Tommy Doyle, and next door, Annie is babysitting Lindsey Wallace. Michael waits patiently to make his move. I love Michael's mask! It's freakin' awesome! Will Laurie survive the dark, bloody HALLOWEEN night? If you love classic horror, I highly recommend HALLOWEEN!!!<br /><br />HALLOWEEN 4- Ten years after Michael tried to kill his sister, and six years after Dan Challis saved the kids from dying from the Silver Shamrock masks, Michael comes out of his coma and wants to kill his niece, Jamie Lloyd. Dr. Loomis tries to stop Michael from doing that. Jamie lives with the Carruthers family. Her step-sister Rachel has a big date on HALLOWEEN, but the babysitter broke her ankle at the ice rink, so Rachel has to babysit Jamie. When Rachel takes Jamie trick-or-treating, Rachel sees her boyfriend with the Sheriff's daughter. Soon, Michael comes after Jamie. Some rednecks try to stop Michael also. Jamie, Rachel, Brady, and Kelly all get stuck in the Sheriff's house with Michael inside. If you love the HALLOWEEN series, you'll love HALLOWEEN 4: THE RETURN OF MICHAEL MYERS!!!<br /><br />HALLOWEEN 5- I love almost all the HALLOWEEN films, but this one goes a little downhill for me for two reasons; (1)If they made the Myers house more believable and not a mansion. (2) Not hint about the stupid thorn curse, then I would probably like it a lot more! One year after stabbing her foster mother, Jamie Lloyd has been taken to a children's hospital. Since Jamie touched Michael's hand, she exhibits signs of a telepathic link with her Uncle Michael. On HALLOWEEN, Michael returns to Haddonfield to finish what he started last year. Rachel, Tina, Mikey, Spitz, and Sammy become Michael's new targets at a HALLOWEEN party as he tries to find Jamie. (That party was awesome with all the HALLOWEEN decorations and costumes!) I love the scene when Michael is chasing Jamie, Billy, and Tina through the cornfields with the car! Donald Pleasence is back playing the awesome Dr. Loomis who tries to hunt Michael throughout the HALLOWEEN night at all costs. Later, Loomis takes Jamie to the Myers house. I love scenes of the police and S.W.A.T. team stakeout at Michael's house. That's pretty cool. Loomis tries to reason with Michael one last time before the showdown. Loomis uses Jamie as bait to trap Michael. When Loomis finally stops Michael, he is taken to the police station, so that the U.S. National Guard will take Michael to a maximum-security prison until he dies, but something bad happens. What happens? You'll just have to watch! If you love the HALLOWEEN series, maybe you'll love HALLOWEEN 5: THE REVENGE OF MICHAEL MYERS!!!like it a lot more!

B0000C9ZSV|1.0|The 1st set is a MAJOR let down. I have it , and now I know why it's never been officially released. The first three songs Fire ,Johnny B. Goode and Hear My Train and second from last Purple Haze are so good that It's hard to comprehend that these songs are from the same set, where Jimi is so out of tune that its' just not worth listening to. I feel sorry for anyone who payed the hefty amount this show is wrongfully being sold for. I bought it for 15.99 from Lifegate , on an Italian website.
B0015ABRE2|4.0|I've been a Michael C. Hall fan since Six Feet Under, and have all three Dexter DVD sets.  I was disappointed in the bonus features in Season 3...as they really don't exist.  The interviews are from Season 2.  There is no commentary.  I would think the production team could give us more than just the episodes.  I'm one of those people who really enjoy the behind-the-scenes extras.  Bummer.
B000F8O4E0|5.0|In my opinion this is one of the best ELO albums (showing my age) ever. This CD includes the classic \\"Fire on High\\", which is one of my all time favorite songs. This CD also includes some extras at the end which are kinda fun. When I played the CD for my kids, with the wierd 70's experimental beginning, my teenage kids thought I had lost my mind. This CD is great in my family room stereo, blasting out of my car stereo, or rocking on my MP3 player.
0786856297|5.0|This book grabs you from the start and never lets you go. Rick Riordan really did his homework and had me looking in my old text books for my memories of my Greek Mythology classes. This action packed book is a real page turner and I recommend it for ALL ages as this is a great way to escape for a few hours into the world of Percy Jackson. If you are a fan of fantasy fiction books this one melds the world of today with the world of ancient Greece and does it very well. Even the fact that Hades is located under L.A. gave me a giggle, though I'm a native californian myself. I also really enjoy that the tale is told in the first person by Percy himself. It makes you feel more like you are right there in the thick of things with our heros. If you are an Artemis Fowl or Harry Potter fan this is another book to add to your shelf. Can't wait to get the next book in the series.
0765350386|4.0|This author will win no awards for his prose, but he creates a convincing world, compelling plot, and interesting characters. Add that all together, and The Final Empire is a great read that will leave you quickly dashing out to get the next in the series.     This first book of the Mistborn Trilogy could stand on its own as a self contained story. It tells the tale of a \\"Crew\\" of thieves undertaking an audacious plan to overthrow The Lord Ruler- the immortal head of The Final Empire. Suffice it to say that the Empire is BAD. Rich, corrupt noblemen swear fealty to the Lord Ruler and use their station to keep the majority of the Empire's population- a class referred to as skaa- in unrelenting slavery. But this crew of skaa thieves is perhaps the best ever. The story largely revolves around two members of their group. They are Mistborn- natural adepts in the magic of this world, known as Alomancy. Kelsier, the crew's leader, is a charismatic scoundrel whose leadership is matched only by his hatred of the noble class and what it has done to he and his people. The second character, Vin, is a young skaa who has been living on the streets, beaten and starving, her entire life. With the rest of the crew they set out on their task- something that has been tried and failed numerous times in the past 1000 years: killing the Lord Ruler.    Let's get the negatives out of the way, first. Mr Sanderson gets full marks for imagination and story-making, but his telling leaves something to be desired. He is prone to repeating the same phrases over and over again. From Vin's \\"flat stares\\" to Kelsier's smiling, I get the feeling that the author was attempting to spice up each scene with numerous descriptions of peoples mannerisms. However this had the opposite effect as each character's \\"trademark\\" mannerism became tired and shallow. There were also many typos in my book (it was the Kindle version, so this could have been an artifact of the digitization) which is always pretty annoyingto me.     Those negatives, however, are only a minor distraction from an otherwise enjoyable read. Let's start with the Characters. Vin really shines as the main protagonist, and the Author is quick to establish more than one challenge for her to overcome. Sure, there is the all-oppressive Final Empire that has enslaved her and her kind. Sure she must learn to fit in with the noble class and infiltrate their ranks. Sure, other Mistborn and crazed henchman of the Ruler (called Inquisitors) seek to rend her limb from limb. But in many ways, Vin's greatest challenge is within herself- overcoming the abuse, neglect and betrayal that has molded her. As the story unfolds, we see a real transformation in her character as she must learn to trust in herself.     Kelsier makes less of a transformation, but his character is equally complex. In many ways he is your cliche of a Noble Scoundrel. And yet, the author constructs him convincingly. He is an embodiment of contradictions, nearly (or possibly completely) insane as a consequence of a previous imprisonment where he saw his wife killed. He trusts his people implicitly, but is ever troubled by a previous betrayal and always taking on great burdens upon himself.     While I think the author's greatest accomplishment was the creation of a unique female character in Vin, one cannot fail to mention the plot. Early in the story, Sanderson tells us that, \\"There is always another secret.\\" That promise holds true as the plot progresses. This is no Ocean's Eleven crew whose wacky antics pull off a convoluted job of unimaginable complexity without a hitch. No, there are setbacks and failures. And as they move along, we see that Kelsier and the Lord Ruler are all more than they seem, with far more secrets to be revealed. The author reveals these secrets well, with clues and twists cleverly embedded throughout the story. For every secret I predicted as I moved through this story, there were two that caught me by delighted surprise.I'm heartened with the explosion of fantasy books that depart from the \\"Tolkien\\" mold of elves and dwarves. Sanderson creates a convincing, dirty, drab world that is stagnant in oppressive stasis under the thumb of the Lord Ruler. It is against this bleak (but convincing) background that characters, relationships and themes of hope and salvation truly shine. While the writing will prevent this from being a classic, I nevertheless think this story will be one of the most memorable among the many books I've read.

I have listened to it 100 times and it still has all of the original charm. Just like I have listened to the Beatles and the Who 100 times. Anyone who does not like this album is a pop culture sheep who cannot think beyond what the record labels tell them to like. I'm listening to the album right now, it is that good.
0307454541|4.0|Seldom does one get introduced to a character as compelling as Lisbeth Salander, a twenty-four-year old social misfit, and private investigator for a security firm, of extraordinary strength, resourcefulness, and capability. The root of her childhood trauma is never quite clear, but she has been under the protection of the state since her teenage years because of her reclusive, anti-social, and indifferent behavior and the convenient diagnosis of retardation. What she is, is a computer hacker extraordinaire with a penchant for detail and memory that is way off the charts. She is small - maybe ninety pounds soaking wet - but her whole punk motif - clothes, body piercings, tattoos, etc - is a warning, well heeded, of inner toughness. Early in the book, her guardian, supposedly her protector, discovers that the payback for crossing the line with Lisbeth can be ruthless.<br /><br />Carl Blomkist is a financial journalist for the leftist magazine Millennium, but his conviction for libeling a Swedish capitalist Hans Wennerstrom has put both his and the magazine's future in considerable jeopardy. He knows that he must leave the magazine for some period of time. But Blomkist's predicament is an opportunity for Henrik Vanger, an aging, retired head of a vast Swedish business empire, to renew his forty year obsession with unraveling the mystery of the disappearance of his brother's grand-daughter Harriet from the family's remote island compound. As Blomkist later discovers, it is Salander who does an amazingly detailed background check on him before he is hired by Henrik. As Blomkist burrows down into the evidence maintained all these years, as well as grasping the extent of the dysfunctionality of the entire Vanger clan, he realizes he needs a research assistant. Who's better than Lisbeth Salander?<br /><br />Forty-something Blomkist is a nice guy: friendly, capable, and open-minded. He's been in an open relationship with his married co-publisher Erika Berger for twenty years, which gets sorely tested when he moves from Stockholm for the foreseeable future to conduct his investigation. That affability is needed in his dealings with the antagonistic Vanger's. He and Lisbeth, in sifting through old photographs, newspaper articles, and even references to Biblical passages, finally start to make inroads on a case thought to be unsolvable, much to the consternation of some. Blomkist's understated charm does not go unnoticed by Cecilia Vanger, as she openly seduces him. More surprising and complex is the edgy relationship of Lisbeth and Michael, which tests her distrust of men.<br /><br />The pace of the book is good and the story lines of Harriet's disappearance, the fortunes of Millennium, and the potential for finally nailing Wennerstrom are interesting. But Lisbeth and Michael make the book. The atmospherics of the Swedish island landscape with its perpetual darkness and cold lend a sense of foreboding. Some aspects are a little wearisome. The many Swedish names and terms can be difficult. And the author has a fondness for telling the reader about every pot of coffee made and consumed. In what may be called \\"bonus coverage,\\" a rather intricate scheme to incriminate Wennerstrom is somewhat mechanically tacked on to the end. The book leaves the reader wanting to know what the future holds for Michael and Lisbeth.rely tested when he moves from Stockholm for the foreseeable future to conduct his investigation.

B00005MP58|4.0|When I first watched this version of P&P, I cringed at all the flaws - Ehle was too old to play Lizzy nor did she fit the book's description very well & the whole athletic-tomboy flavor the script writer gave her still irks me even now.  Yes, Lizzy loved the outdoors & she loved walking, but the jogging thing would have been unladylike & she understood propriety.      The actress who played Jane, while pretty in a classical way, was hardly the beauty described by Austen.  Mrs. Bennett's portrayal was screechy & over the top.  Lydia's was a little overdone, too.  Darcy's taking a dip in the pond at Pemberly was just stupid (& I am so grateful that Firth refused to cooperate with their misguided intention to make it a skinny-dipping scene).  The list goes on, but it's actually not the point of my review.  Suffice it to say, my first viewing of this edition was not enthusiastic.    Then, after watching the 1980 BBC version & turning it off in disgust (too much of the story was changed & Rintoul's Darcy was painfully stiff & unappealing), I decided to try this one again & just accept the flaws & overlook them.  To my surprise, everytime I see this version I love it more!      It was quite faithfully adapted from Austen's book, & for the most part, the changes made for the script stayed true to the book in spirit.  Yes, Ehle's jogging still sets my teeth on edge & she still was not quite so light & light-hearted as Lizzy, nor was Colin Firth's portrayal of Darcy flawless.  BUT they are both excellent actors & did such a masterful job with what they had!  And I seriously doubt that anyone will ever be able to surpass Firth's portrayal of Darcy - he conveyed so much emotion with just the expression of his eyes!    Having now seen all 4 versions (1940, 1980, 1996 & 2005) thru our local library, THIS alone is the version that I have decided is a must have for my personal library!  It has actually positively enhanced my appreciation of Austen's story!
1934997005|5.0|I am not here reviewing the book, but rather the reading and abridging by Dawkins. I have just received this and although I have in the past read this material, it has now come to life as Richard Dawkins has done a splendid job.    Not only do I find his voice pleasing, his slight English accent (to an American) gives me the feeling that Darwin himself is speaking. Dawkins has spent a great deal of effort to emphasize words so that the intended meanings come across more clearly. It is a bit like the difference between a 2d movie and the same one in 3d.    The nearest comparison is to some of the works of the late Carl Sagan, who when reading aloud his own material was head and shoulders above anyone else who didn't really understand the material, but was simply reading it.    The only negative is that he speaks a bit too fast for me. However, I solved that by converting the files to mp3 and using my audio software to slow them down to 85% of original speed. I now am listening to these on my daily exercise walk via an mp3 player with shure sound isolating earphones. I expect to listen to some of it again and again, as it is still difficult to grasp all of it at once while busy watching where I am walking.     As to Darwin, it is refreshing to see how so much of his theory is backed up by first hand information. In this day of high tech, it seems all information is really 3rd, 4th, or Nth hand summaries of other peoples works. When Dawkins reads the part on the struggle for existence, you can actually visualize Darwin crawling around that fenced in plot of ground getting dirty as he measured the height of the plants (or trees) and counted the rings himself to determine how many years the cattle had been keeping the vegetation from growing.     And I find his prose to be almost poetic; reading it just doesn't have the same affect as hearing Dawkins speak it aloud. It's the feline population that keeps the mice down, allowing for more bees to pollinate the flowers. Notjust cats eating mice. I didn't quote this exactly, but I think you get the idea.

And Florence Welch and Co. produce a solid debut, \\"Lungs,\\" that blends delicate polished instrumentals and different genres -- there's little splatters of pop, punk and soul woven together, and cemented in place by Welch's lovely voice.<br /><br />It kicks off with the plucked intro of \\"Dog Days Are Over,\\" with Welch's sweet voice singing about \\"Happiness hit her like a bullet in the head/Struck from a great height by someone who should know better than that.\\" While it starts off as soft, ethereal pop, the melody is swathed in eruptions of orchestral pop-rock -- it gets loud'n'catchy, with Welch yelling, \\"The doooog days are OVER-ER/the dooooog days are ALL DONE!\\"<br /><br />She continues the high note with \\"Rabbit Heart (Raise It Up),\\" a scintillatingly colorful melody that sounds like a thunderstorm in a flower garden. After that she unleashes a bunch of other great songs: the soulful \\"I'm Not Calling You A Liar,\\" the urgent piano-pop of \\"Howl,\\" the wandering twangy \\"Girl With One Eye,\\" the bouncy wistful \\"Between Two Lungs,\\" and the sweetly macabre \\"My Boy Builds Coffins.\\" An especially fun one is \\"Kiss With A Fist,\\" a blazing punky tune that celebrates rough'n'passionate relationships (\\"You hit me once, I hit you back/you gave a kick, I gave a slap/you crashed a plate over my head/and I set fire to our bed!\\").<br /><br />But Welch and her revolving-door band really shine when the music overflows into a steady river of fiery rock'n'roll, wrapped in twisting gossamer synth and soaring rich vocals. \\"Howl,\\" the hymnlike \\"Drumming\\" and the bleak \\"Hurricane Drunk\\" all fit into this category -- and these are absolutely stunning songs, if not as immediately accessible as the catchier tunes.<br /><br />Florence and the Machine has a pretty unique sound -- there's a lot of punky rock'n'roll, a spattering of pop's catchiness, and some jazzy overtones woven into a few of the songs. As debut albums go, this is a pretty spectacular one, with a distinctive flavour that sounds like little else in modern music -- the closest comparison that comes to mind would be if Joanna Newsom formed a punk-rock band and went for pop stardom.<br /><br />In particular, Welch has a very pretty voice -- it's a little wavery and girlish, but she sculpts it into a flickering, roaring presence in the louder songs. And she has a knack for dark, evocative lyrics (\\"Louder than sirens, louder than bells/sweeter than heaven and hotter than hell!\\") with a quirky edge (\\"He's made [a coffin] for himself/One for me too/One of these days he'll make one for you\\"). There are a few lines that need some smoothing out, but not badly enough to distract.<br /><br />And the instrumentation from The Machine is a gorgeous accompaniment -- lots of rich, swirling instrumentals and straight-ahead rock'n'roll, usually depending on Robert Ackroyd's strong electric guitar and Christopher Lloyd Hayden's solid drumming. Isabella Summers wraps the album in gossamer-soft synth, and Tom Monger adds to the ethereal edge with a harp -- it also helps give it a more classical sound, rather than straight rock-pop.<br /><br />Florence and the Machine's debut \\"Lungs\\" really shows why this band has been getting so much attention across the pond -- it's passionate, eclectic and a lovely piece of work.

B000G0O5N2|5.0|Que bien tratada esta esta pelicula; Somalia 1992-1993,estuve ahi y mejor descripcion ninguna. Una pelicula para coleccion.
B001EO748M|1.0|This series attempts to modernize the 1500s and it is hilarious. Dialogue right out of the worst scripts Hollywood put forth, but this is not fun, as those scrpts and presentations were. This is a bore, and Henry VIII had paintings done of him; he was very tall and very fat, but, he was intelligent too, when not letting sex get the better of him, and this Henry is very dumb. The acting, as in part I, terrible, especially this Henry. Stock gestures of thge 60s and 70s when this period was portrayed. No sense at all about the precariousness of life in those days, and the fear of assasination, of untimely death, and madness. All nuances are missing.    See Young Bess, Charles Laughton as Henry..anything but this.
0307269981|4.0|The girl who played with fire is the second novel in the Stieg Larsson's trilogy and it is fantastic.  The book opens with Salander living off her new found wealth and basically hoping from place to place.  She is being accused of murder and her old friend Mikael Blomkvist who hasn't seen her is looking for her.  We learn about her background through bits and pieces and about other topics such as the sex trade through Blomkvist's magazine.  I really liked the book and look forward to the third book.  I didn't think it was as solid as the first book but it was fast paced.  I am sad that this author has passed and we won't have anymore books from him.  I only gave this book 4 stars b/c I felt there was some undeveloped ideas and maybe there will be some conclusion in the third book.  I also thought maybe there might be a bit of a let down just b/c there was so much of a wow factor for me with the Girl with a dragon tattoo that I might have been expecting too much from this novel?  Either way I still think it was a great novel and am looking forward to the next one.
B001OQCV9M|4.0|Julie and Julia contrasts the elegant fifties expatriate lifestyle of Julia Child and her husband with the youthful contemporary life of Julie Powell, a  college educated temp office worker who lives in a Queens walkup. Both of them share a love of cooking and their husbands. Julie starts cooking her way through Child's cookbook \\"Mastering the Art of French Cooking\\" motivated by a feeling of malaise about turning thirty and having to do secretarial work. Her mom lives in Texas and is not exactly supportive. Julia Child turns into a kind of maternal figure for Julie, i.e., the wise, witty, urbane mother that Julie needs to find her way as an adult.<br /><br />Meryl Streep is over the top as Julia Child which is fine, since Child was a woman who loved to call attention to herself. Julie (Amy Adams) is more self-effacing, unfortunately. One of the great things about Julie's original blog was its profanity and downright snarkiness; I miss that edgy quality in the cinematic Julie's character. Julie is just too nice in this film. The scenes that take place in postwar Paris are the best in the film. The costumes are by the wonderful Ann Roth (I hope she gets another Oscar nomination for them). The scenes in New York are shot on location. As is so often the case in New York apartments portrayed in the movies, their apartment is much more spacious and charming than such an apartment would ever be in reality. I guess that showing the way low-income New Yorkers actually live would be too shocking to the ordinary viewer.
B000F1IQN2|4.0|It is a well done film and has many aspects of the story that create great suspense, intrigue, and self questioning. My  issues with the film are few but important. For instance, I am disappointed by  the way in which the director creates a tie in at the end between Avner making love to his wife in Brooklyn, and the final bloody shoot out between the PLO hostage terrorists and the German police interjected in between the humping and slobbering.  Eric Bana's character feels guilty and his catharsis from guilt  comes from the semi violent act of making love to his wife??? Quite ridiculous and far fetched in my opinion, and clearly  the only quick and easy way out of the film for the director which is running long 164 minutes, and lacking a clean, happy and realistic ending. With notable exceptions, Spielberg often leans toward unrealistic happy endings. However since he is dealing with a real story, perhaps a real ending could have been more important for the sense of reality that the film attempts to capture. In the end, his own government disappoints him when he questions the policy of going after the terrorists in the same terrorist manner that they have experienced.   One other issue has to do with the story itself. It seems pretty unbelievable that after the French informants have put them in a safe house in Greece with the Palestinian terrorists - and somehow surviving, that Avner and his associates continue to trust the informants despite being set-up by them.  Overall an important film about  story that has received a lot of press but one which has put little scrutiny on the German government and people for the lousy handling of the Munich massacre that reads almost like a \\"how not to handle a hostage crisis\\". When considering the history of Germany and the jewish people, how can one not point the finger at the German government and police for their ineptitude in creating a shoot out in which no hostages were left alive. Then a few weeks later how quickly thespineless German government chose to extricate themselves from the mess they created in the first pace thru their poor security at the Munich games by deciding to  hand over the 3 remaining captured terrorists to the Libyans in exchange for 12 Germans whose plane was hijacked in the middle east.

0743497465|2.0|I'm not going to say this was the worst book I ever read... but how anyone could give it 5 stars is beyond me. There was some suspense and some action scenes but the lack of believability is so distracting that its hard to be impacted by this book in any way. To get 5 stars a book should have to impact you somehow, or change your perspective on something or give you the chills once in a while. This book is far to shallow to do anything like that. Its not fair to compare it to Da Vinci Code, but just be aware, just becuase you liked Da Vinci Code doesn't mean you'll like this one.
0312330537|4.0|The scope of this book is truly amazing. The story and the characters are absolutely captivating and lovable. I remember all of the characters as if I had known them personally for years. The main character accomplishes so much more in this book than almost any other book I have read and his journey is incredible. The book takes you to fascinating places you have always wondered about, but they are places that you will probably never ever see because of the risks involved of getting there and being there.<br /><br />I could go on and on about how great the story and the characters are (5 stars for sure), but I want to talk about the author and writing style...<br /><br />Don't hate me for saying this but there were many times throughout the book where I got the sense that the author was a little full of himself. He keeps harping on about all these life lessons and towards the end it got a little tiring. I would have preferred if he would have left it up to the reader to determine the morals involved with the protagonist's story rather than blatantly pushing a message across to the reader over and over again. I ended up trying to block these bits out and found the book much more enjoyable this way.<br /><br />I'm not telling you this merely for the sake of complaining, but I know there are other readers out there who think like me, and I want to tell them to just get past the author's at times condescending tone, so that you can enjoy the truly wonderful journey.
0307386171|1.0|Let's be honest here. The guy can write and I am sure he portrays the characters beautifully with their insecurities around each other, yet their confidence when apart. However, come on. On their honeymoon, Edward, who obviously could not control himself, faulted with his wife Florence, who is disgusted by the act in itself which outlines her lack of confidence and her low self-esteem. Where is the story? She runs out after the incident and then admits her distaste in the ceremony of man and wife; then why get married? What else would you expect?! It's your honeymoon for crying out loud. Where's the love story when there is no love? She acted selfish and obviously didn't love him enough to give herself to him regardless of the sacred act. This book climaxed in the last 10 pages and was not worth the wait. I am sure this kind of stuff happens every day except the virgins are teenagers!
006135323X|4.0|This books explores the behavioral economics field and it delves deep into the mysteries of how the human mind works. The stories of human irrationality are quite interesting and fascinating and cover many topics:<br />- Relativity<br />- Anchors<br />- The Free! effect<br />- Social and market norms<br />- Sexual arousal<br />- Procrastination<br />- The price of ownership<br />- Keeping options<br />- The effect of expectations<br />- The placebo effect<br />- Dishonesty in the face of money and a moral code<br />While the stories and experiments are very fascinating, I believe that the experiments set-up and results do not pass the test of reproducibility and statistical significance. Therefore, most of the conclusions and claims of the author are not scientifically valid, hence the four stars.

0316017922|5.0|A well thought out and researched book. Mr. Gladwell does a great job explaining the roots of exceptional people, and exposing some of the myths that cause society to worship them rather than emulate their achievements.

1439138311|3.0|Did you ever get a book that you really wanted to like, but found yourself slowly pulling away from it the further that you read? This was the case for me with Colm Toibin's [[ASIN:1439138311 Brooklyn: A Novel]].<br /><br />And it's even worse when you hate giving the works of an author a bad review.<br /><br />Had read many of the major newspaper reviews of this book prior to ordering it, and felt that it would be an interesting read. One reviewer had made a positive allusion to George Eliot's classic Silas Marner while describing a passage, and another called it \\"hauntingly beautiful and heartbreaking.\\" I was looking forward to reading this book for the personal reasons of having been born in Brooklyn and having a smattering of Irish family background.<br /><br />Maybe it's me, but this book just didn't live up to my expectations. Even worse, the book is so flat in its style that it just kept putting me to sleep. This may be a personal thing, but one that I rarely encounter in most books today.<br /><br />The plot is simple enough, and I'm outlining here: a young Irish woman named Eilis Lacey leaves Ireland for Brooklyn in the 1950s for a better economic opportunity. One there, an Irish priest finds a sales position for her in a department store, and helps her find a room with an older Irish lady, one who takes in young female borders.<br /><br />The priest helps her get into Brooklyn College night school in order for her to get certification in bookkeeping and secure a better paying position. She meets and is courted by a young Italian man, and when things seem to be going well for Eilis, a family tragedy happens in Ireland, forcing her to return. Without turning this into a spoiler, a series of events take place which force her to make a critical decision.<br /><br />My problem with this book is that I found the tale to be monotonous and flat. Eilis seemed quite impassive, and she seemed to only be able to react the decisions of others, and not her own. The more that I read, the more disappointed I became, and it became a harder book to even finish towards the end. As noted earlier, it may be a personal thing, but this one left me wishing that the characters, especially Eilis, had been better developed... more three-dimensional.<br /><br />The laudatory reviews of Colm Toibin's latest offering are surprising to this reader, and I'll have to think twice or thumb through a library copy before I try to tackle another of this author's books again.<br /><br />Calling it a 3-star book is the best that I can do with it., and it became a harder book to even finish towards the end. As noted earlier, it may be a personal thing, but this one left me wishing that the characters, especially Eilis, had been better developed... more three-dimensional.    The laudatory reviews of Colm Toibin's latest offering are surprising to this reader, and I'll have to think twice or thumb through a library copy before I try to tackle another of this author's books again.     Calling it a 3-star book is the best that I can do with it.
B0013FDM7E|4.0|I really had no idea what to expect when I bought this movie. I had heard from my sister that it was something I'd really enjoy, so I decided to give it a try. I was not unhappy with my decision. I overall really enjoyed this film. Will Smith, once again, doesn't fail to deliver a great performance. Very action-ey and will keep you wondering. My boyfriend who doesn't normally enjoy movies really loved it also, a definite plus for the movie.
B002BIULQC|5.0|Since 2006, \\"Hannah Montana\\" has not only been a popular television series for the Disney Channel but a series that has definitely made Miley Cyrus, daughter of country music star Billy Ray Cyrus, a bonafide star.<br /><br />It was one thing to watch this young teenager who was 13-years old at the time, grow up and become a popular television star and music talent that would sell out many concert venues, has had her music on top of the Billboard charts and now has two Disney films under her belt.<br /><br />The first film from Disney focused on a 3D version of her concert and television show personality but this time around, \\"Hannah Montana: The Movie\\" takes to the big screen and takes a more serious look at Miley Cyrus's character as her pop star identity has now affected her family and he friendship and has come to the point that the lifestyle of a popstar has gotten to her head.<br /><br />The film is directed by Peter Chelsom (\\"Shall We Dance\\", \\"Serendipity\\" and \\"Town & Country\\"), a screenplay by Daniel Berendsen (\\"Sabrina, the Teenage Witch\\", \\"The Cheetah Girls: One World\\") , composer John Debney (\\"The Mummy: Tomb of the Dragon Emperor\\", \\"Spider-Man 3\\" and \\"Sin City\\") and cinematographer David Hennings (\\"Strange Wilderness\\", \\"Blue Crush\\" and \\"Ice Princess\\").<br /><br />For those not familiar with the television series, former music artist Robby Ray Stewart (Billy Ray Cyrus) has moved his family (which include Miley, played by Miley Cyrus, and her older brother Jackson, played by Jason Earles) from Tennessee to Malibu in order to manage his daughter Miley's music career.  But in order to keep sanity at their home and keep their family together, he and Miley has kept secret identities and Miley dons a blonde wig and goes by the name Hannah Montana.  Along with her best friend Lilly Truscott (Emily Osment) and friend Oliver Oken (Mitchel Musso), who also take on disguises, help protect Miley's secret.<br /><br />In \\"Hannah Montana: The Movie\\", the film picks up with Hannah Montana's career doing quite well and is now managed by Vita (Vanessa Williams).  While Vita is successfully booking Hannah in various, major events, the fame has kept her busy to be with family (to celebrate Jackson's entrance to college) and Lilly's birthday party.  To make things worse, a member of the paparazzi is trying to figure out Hannah Montana's secret.<br /><br />After Hannah ends up getting into fight with Tyra Banks over some shoes and getting plastered on the newspapers and disrupting Lilly's birthday party by coming as Hannah Montana, Robby Ray feels that his daughter Miley can't balance her time as a family member and friend and is focusing too much of her life as Hannah Montana and thus tricks her to going to Tennessee (instead of an award ceremony in New York).<br /><br />Hannah is not pleased that her father has tricked her and prevented her from attending the award show and is upset that he dragged her to the farmlife in Tennessee.  But Robby Ray wants her to remember where she came from and that Tennessee was their home before California.<br /><br />While in Tennessee, Miley tries to adjust to the slow-paced life and meets an old friend when she was younger named Travis Brody (Lucas Till) who she becomes closer too, while her father Robby Ray gets closer to Lorelai (Melora Hardin), but with both of them having to live secret lives, can Miley or Robby Ray ever be able to have a normal life?<br /><br />\\"Hannah Montana: The Movie\\" comes with three discs.  The first is the Blu-ray Disc, the second being the Digital Copy and the third is the DVD.<br /><br />VIDEO & AUDIO:<br /><br />\\"Hannah Montana: The Movie\\" is featured in 1080p High Definition with an aspect ration of 1:85:1.  For the most part, the film is absolutely vibrant.  There are many outdoor scenes that showcase the film's color.  May it be the shot at Lilly's birthday party at Santa Monica Beach to the lush area of Tennessee.  The film definitely showcases a broad spectrum of colors, all of which are sharp, clear and absolutely eye-popping.  For the most part, David Hennings did a great job with utilizing the environment with this film and overall, picture quality is magnificent.<br /><br />As for audio, this is probably the first time I have seen Disney sport an English 7.1 DTS-HD Master Audio soundtrack (the film is also presented in French and Spanish 5.1 Dolby Digital).  The dialogue is crystal clear and as much as this film is dialogue driven, with it also being somewhat of a musical as well, music plays a big part of this film and sounds fantastic.  Definitely good utilization of surrounds to pick up crowd ambiance or the animals at the farm but for the most part, this is a film where dialogue is king and music is also a big part of the film. Thus the soundtrack is quite crystal clear, the lossless audio definitely makes the music come alive.<br /><br />As for subtitles, \\"Hannah Montana: The Movie is presented in English SDH, French and Spanish.<br /><br />A DVD is included and sports a widescreen (1:85:1) - enhanced for 16×9 televisions and an audio soundtrack sporting a Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound soundtrack.<br /><br />SPECIAL FEATURES:<br /><br />\\"Hannah Montana: The Movie\\" features the following special features with some in 1080p High Definition or 480i Standard Definition:<br /><br />  * Audio Commentary by Director Peter Chelsom - Peter Chelsom is the type of director who utilizes his commentary to thoroughly setup a scene and give credit to who came up with the ideas in pulling them off.  From utilizing scenes from Miley Cyrus's first film and inserting scenes into the film to how animals were brought in to the film and managing over a thousand extras, this is a very thorough commentary.<br />  * Deleted Scenes - (10:35) A total of four deleted scenes which features an introduction by director Peter Chelsom discussing why they were removed.  But for the most part, Chelsom says the film is the final cut and mostly all footage was utilized in the film.  But the four deleted scenes included are: \\"Jackson: I'm Pretending to Be at University...\\", \\"How Are We Going to Get Hannah Down to Crowley Corners?\\", \\"Oswald and the Hannah Wigs\\" and \\"Oswald, The Ostrich and the Alligator\\"<br />  * Music Videos - (9:30) There are a total of seven music videos included.

People will need a profile 2.0 Blu-ray player to take advantage of this capability.<br /><br />JUDGMENT CALL:<br /><br />When it comes to \\"Hannah Montana: The Movie\\", it's almost similar to what I had to say about \\"The Jonas Brothers: 3-D Concert Experience\\" in that these films are created for their fans.<br /><br />\\"Hannah Montana\\" is a popular children's television show with a large following and I have watched many television shows with my son and although I'm not as familiar with her music, every decade there are shows that will appeal to their young fans and many of those who scratch their heads and just don't get why people find it so appealing.  In the 80's we had \\"Kids Incorporated\\", in the 90's we had \\"Saved By the Bell\\" and although Saturday morning teen shows and afternoon teen shows on network television are a thing of the past, these shows have continued on the Disney Channel and \\"Hannah Montana\\" is simply a popular series with a lot of merchandising behind the series and its star Miley Cyrus.<br /><br />And those who are not fans, they are going to criticize and those who never cared for Hannah Montana or Miley Cyrus, it's a given that they are not going to give a care for this film.<br /><br />But how did I feel about the film?  As a guy who tends to write a lot about teen or young entertainment worldwide, may it be their music or television careers, I enjoyed the film.  Of course, it all comes from my knowledge of the series and knowing how quarky the television series is but also knowing the difficult the character of Miley Stewart has in juggling both worlds of a normal teenager and a pop star.<br /><br />But what I found more interesting is seeing Robby Ray stepping down and knocking Miley off her high horse.  He notices that the fame is getting to her head and that if he doesn't change things now, he's going to lose that daughter who was always caring for her family and her friends.<br /><br />So, when it comes to the dramatic scenes, I enjoyed watching that part.  As for the music, this is more geared for her fans.  Obviously, with her single \\"The Climb\\" and the soundtrack of this film doing so well on the Billboard Charts, it's quite evident that she has a strong fandom of fans that are passionate for her music.  The film is not \\"High School Musical\\" and every scene is full of music and a little on drama, it's quite the opposite where there are more acting scenes and music plays a more important part towards the second half of the film.  Also, you get music from Taylor Swift and Rascal Flatts and both offer an incentive to check out the film as well.<br /><br />There was a superhero-esque (or more like \\"Spider-Man 2\\") type of storyline near the end which I won't get into but overall, I suppose that those who have watched her television show will find out if Miley Stewart or Hannah Montana will be the last persona standing.<br /><br />For the most part, I found the film to be enjoyable, fun and it was good to see Miley Cyrus take on an emotional scene.  I thought that the ending scene with the talent and film crew doing \\"The Hoedown Throwdown Dance\\" was hilarious and fun and for the most part, I'm quite confident that fans of Miley Cyrus and Hannah Montana are going to have a great time with this release.<br /><br />As for the Blu-ray release, you get a ton of special features and as typical of Walt Disney Studio Home Entertainment releases, its one company where you know that their releases are going to be given absolute awesome picture and audio quality.  And I can definitely tell you that this 3-Disc release will definitely be well worth it for the Miley Cyrus and Hannah Montana fans.<br /><br />Overall, presentation and audio wise and the content included on this release is magnificent but as for the film, it all comes down to whether or not you are a fan of Miley Cyrus or her television show.  Otherwise, if you had no care in the world for her music or the show, then you know this release is not for you.  But for those who are passionate about her music and her series, then I can tell you that this Blu-ray release is highly recommended!ily and friends through the innovative movie-watching experience!  People will need a profile 2.0 Blu-ray player to take advantage of this capability.    JUDGMENT CALL:    When it comes to \\"Hannah Montana: The Movie\\", it's almost similar to what I had to say about \\"The Jonas Brothers: 3-D Concert Experience\\" in that these films are created for their fans.    \\"Hannah Montana\\" is a popular children's television show with a large following and I have watched many television shows with my son and although I'm not as familiar with her music, every decade there are shows that will appeal to their young fans and many of those who scratch their heads and just don't get why people find it so appealing.

But what I found more interesting is seeing Robby Ray stepping down and knocking Miley off her high horse.  He notices that the fame is getting to her head and that if he doesn't change things now, he's going to lose that daughter who was always caring for her family and her friends.    So, when it comes to the dramatic scenes,I enjoyed watching that part.  As for the music, this is more geared for her fans.  Obviously, with her single \\"The Climb\\" and the soundtrack of this film doing so well on the Billboard Charts, it's quite evident that she has a strong fandom of fans that are passionate for her music.  The film is not \\"High School Musical\\" and every scene is full of music and a little on drama, it's quite the opposite where there are more acting scenes and music plays a more important part towards the second half of the film.  Also, you get music from Taylor Swift and Rascal Flatts and both offer an incentive to check out the film as well.    There was a superhero-esque (or more like \\"Spider-Man 2\\") type of storyline near the end which I won't get into but overall, I suppose that those who have watched her television show will find out if Miley Stewart or Hannah Montana will be the last persona standing.    For the most part, I found the film to be enjoyable, fun and it was good to see Miley Cyrus take on an emotional scene.  I thought that the ending scene with the talent and film crew doing \\"The Hoedown Throwdown Dance\\" was hilarious and fun and for the most part, I'm quite confident that fans of Miley Cyrus and Hannah Montana are going to have a great time with this release.    As for the Blu-ray release, you get a ton of special features and as typical of Walt Disney Studio Home Entertainment releases, its one company where you know that their releases are going to be given absolute awesome picture and audio quality.  And I can definitely tell you that this 3-Disc release will definitely be well worth it for the Miley Cyrus and Hannah Montana fans.    Overall, presentation and audio wise and the content included on this release is magnificent but as for the film, it all comes down to whether or not you are a fan of Miley Cyrus or her television show.  Otherwise, if you had no care in the world for her music or the show, then you know this release is not for you.  But for those who are passionate about her music and her series, then I can tell you that this Blu-ray release is highly recommended!
0786838655|4.0|Overall I really liked this book, it did take a little bit to get into, but once I was into it I got hooked and am anxious to read the rest of the series.  I also had forgotten a lot of Greek and Roman mythology so it gave me a nice refresher course.
0765350386|5.0|As a young adult, I read a lot of fantasy.  But when I got into the business world, I started reading non-fiction and the occasional thriller.<br /><br />I came across a recommendation for this Mistborn series and bought the trilogy. This is a very well-constructed story with a number of great characters.  I found myself quickly dragged into it and engaged in the plot.  As soon as I finished the first book, I immediately started the second.  I am now about to begin the third one as I write this comment.<br /><br />I find the Allomancy (magic with metal alloys) to be an interesting idea that appeals to the scientist/engineer in me.  It is a logical system even though it is still magic.<br /><br />If you haven't read fantasy for a while, and used to enjoy it, I recommend the Mistborn series.  And if you go to Brandon Sanderson's website, he offers annotations on what he was thinking at the end of each chapter as he wrote the books. I found that to be an interesting glimpse into the creative process...
B001GCUER0|5.0|Another great season of Mad Men. All episodes are entertaining and the viewer continues to learn more about the main characters. I just love watching sets, products and clients from 1960! It's a kick.
0440237688|2.0|I don't understand what's the big deal about this book. Having read tons of scifi, I expected more from a Newberry winner. What I got was a rehash of The Lottery, with the typical utopian society so immersed in its own sickness it can't see straight. This book is all right for younger audiences, but I like more complexity and originality in my books.
B000002KCC|5.0|since the early 1980s. But I had to write this review to pay tribute to Young's masterpiece. Some work transcends the genre to which it superficially belongs. This is one of those.    If Samuel Beckett had played a guitar...
072265197X|4.0|The volume was received in a surprisingly short time after the order was placed. The quality and format of the volume were exactly as described in the sale notice and will more than adequately fulfill the grandparental intent.A good outcome for one so geographically far away.
1416550518|3.0|The era is an interesting one, the author does a good job of showing the class structure that still existed in Britain at the time, and the plot, while not very original, could make a good story.  The problem is that the author wasn't successful in pacing the story.  As other reviewers have noted, it moves quite slowly. For a first novel, not at all a bad effort, but with time and experience, I suspect the author will become more effective at tightening the narrative and keep the plot moving along.
B002BEXG7W|5.0|For those who love the music of The Doors, the DCC Gold Discs mastered by Steve Hoffman are the very best 16/44.1 redbook CD versions. Hoffman used the original master tapes for the transfers. No attempts were made unduly boost highs, mids or lows. His approach has always been primum non nocere (first do no harm). The results are true and honest. This is what audiophile recordings should be.    The only problem has been that there were only four DCC Gold Discs of The Doors recordings (\\"The Doors\\", \\"L.A. Woman\\", \\"Strange Days\\" and \\"Waiting For The Sun\\"). Now this has been remedied by the Audio Fidelity Gold Disc releases of \\"The Soft Parade\\" and \\"Morrison Hotel\\". All meticulously mastered by Steve Hoffman from the original master tapes. The results are glorious to say the least. Both numbered discs have a few bonus tracks, but that's not why I bought them.    I am grateful to own all six The Doors gold discs mastered by Hoffman. I would highly recommend purchasing both gold discs before they disappear from inventory.

1416550542|5.0|If you remember the book and movie (with G. Paltrow) \\"Possession\\", and if you loved it as much as I you will become one with this book.  It is more a diary, a journal, a tale of a little girl lost, and old woman found, a mystery, a beautiful place to dwell, a sad story of loss and love.  It is all those things and more.  The author spins you into the tale and you travel between three generations in time.  You become part of the mystery and cannot solve it until she reveals the truth at the very end.  She has a  wonderful way with words and she weaves you into the cloth of her story until you refuse to leave - but must because the characters do.  This is an exceptional book and I don't know why others have rated it so low.  This will go on my special bookshelf to be saved and savored.  Don't neglect yourself by passing this journey up in favor of some trivial read.
0143113100|5.0|The localization theory of the brain holds that each part of the brain has a certain dedicated function. Once damage has happened to that part of the brain then those functions will be permanently lost or impaired. Modern research has replaced the theory of localization with the theory of plasticity. The brain is flexible and can be molded like plastic. There are some utterly fascinating case histories.    The most inspiring story was of a woman named Barbara. She was born mentally disabled. She had trouble with special awareness. When she was three she was playing `matador and bull' with a parked car but did not swerve away from the car. She ran headfirst into it and cut her head open. Her mother didn't think she'd live to be five. She also had trouble with abstract concepts such as telling the difference between \\"father's brother\\" and \\"brother's father.\\" She couldn't tell her left hand from her right. It also made it difficult to relate to people because she had difficulty following conversations. She would replay song lyrics and movie dialogues over and over in her head trying to make sense of them. Reading was very difficult for her because couldn't understand the symbols or what they meant, except with the most excruciating effort. Once she had a cold and mistakenly put sulfuric acid into her nose instead of the cold medicine. She lay in bed with acid running into her sinuses because she was too ashamed to tell her mother of yet another mishap. This kind of stuff makes your heart brake for her.    On the bright side, she was great at memorization. She could memorize math procedures even if she couldn't understand the concept of addition. She was also tremendously determined. She made it to college and entered graduate school in the hopes of discovering a cure to her own condition. The prevailing theory for treating the disabled was compensation. Barbara had already been doing that - she used her memory because she wasn't good at abstract thinking or special awareness. But she stumbled across the emerging literature on neuroplasticity. That led her to the opposite approach, what another researcher called constrain-induced learning. The brain is plastic but it also follows the path of least resistance. Block off what you are good at and force yourself to developed your weaknesses with intense practice.    Barbara couldn't read a clock because she wasn't good at abstract concepts. But she had a friend make hundreds of flash cards with pictures of clocks on them and the time on the other side. She spent long days going over the flashcards. At first she was no good at them. She would take a real clock and spend hours slowly advancing its hands trying to figure out why 2:45 meant that the minute hand was on the nine. Slowly she got better. She added a \\"second hand\\" and even a \\"sixtieths of a second\\" hand. She figured that out too. She was much faster at telling time than most people who weren't mentally disabled. Inspired she created similar exercises for her other disabilities. They worked too.     Eventually she founded a school based on her methods. They had sixteen year olds who read at a first grade level. They would do drills like telling time on a clock with ten hands, and trace out characters in Chinese and Urdu (which aren't as familiar as our alphabet). The amazing thing isn't that the students didn't just get better at the tasks. There were large spillover effects. Time spent on these abstruse drills led to faster speech with better enunciation, and better special awareness. The rewiring that was taking place in the brain created a general improvement, not just an improvement in telling time or tracing characters. Doidge concludes:    \\"The irony of this new discovery is that for hundreds of years educators did seem to sense that children's brains had to be built up through exercises of increasing difficulty that strengthened brain functions. Up through the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries a classical education often included rote memorization of long poems in foreign languages, which strengthened the auditory memory (hence thinking in language) and an almost fanatical attention to handwriting,  ... Then in the 1960s educators dropped such traditional exercises from the curriculum\\"    Another application of neuroplasticity is to sexuality. This may be the first book arguing that pornography is unhealthy written since 1980, but it makes a compelling case. One of the maxims of neuroplasticity is that \\"nerves that fire together wire together.\\" Pornography, like all activities that trigger the brain's release on dopamine, leads to increasing tolerance. You need a stronger dose to get the same high. That usually sends people looking for more and more cryptic fetishes to connect to sexuality so that the brain has new and novel pathways for sexual stimulus. This makes it tough for men to be attracted to real women, at least, not if they are not acting out an elaborate script from his fantasies. But neuroplasticity offers some hope too. \\"nerves that fire apart wire apart.\\" The author worked with one patient who associated sex with violence. He encouraged his patient to develop separate behaviors so that the sex and the violence were no longer intermingled. Eventually the brains neural maps of the two, which had been fused, separated.
B001S6Y0AQ|5.0|This album is one of the best albums of all time. It sounds absolutely great and the 2nd CD live performance is also wonderful. Totally recommended!
B000VBP38C|5.0|Though I love the movie and it showed up on time, I was very disappointed that it was a \\"wide screen\\" version. I don't recall seeing that at time of order anywhere. My TV is small and wide screen would definitely not be my choice.

It is a sweet, funny picture with a message at the end.  I love you guys!

B001FB55H6|3.0|First off the movies beginning was WAYYY too long.  The action was pretty cool as well as the cinematography.  I think it was a bit on the gory side with the hacking off of appendages, but overall ok.  I don't think I should have bought it first but rented it on itunes or some other cheap method of previewing the movie before going first to blueray.  My chief complaint was mister blue penis man.  Definately could have done without that.  Second was the length of the movie.    I don't think I would recommend it to anyone even at an entertainment value.  The only reason why it got 3 stars from me was because of the cinematography and special effects.
1577314808|5.0|This is a wonderful book if you are seeking a way to cope with everyday life situations. It is a common sense way of dealing with the ups and downs, and how to live in our fast paced pressure filled world of today. I find myself remembering the teachings of this book when I am in a stressful situation. I have learned that what Mr. Tolle tries to do in his book is point to the way of living in a more simplistic way.  If you are on the road to self discovery or are in the midst of changing your life for the better, check out this book, it will be a useful guide for the rest of your life!
080701429X|5.0|... I really do. It's a great departure from the metaphysics of Jung and the sex-centered Freud. It might have been more helpful to present his theory of logotherapy before his account of the camps, but it still worked. And to all the people who bashed the book for not being complete in some way read page 97, Frankl flat outs says that it would be impossible to condense his entire theory down to 20-30 pages when it took volume upon volume in his native German to lay it all out. If you're going to bash a book on these bases you might not want to forget the author's own disclaimer (or maybe you do because then you wouldn't have anything to whine about).
B0006GAOBI|4.0|This challenging and though provoking film needs to be seen more than once to really appreciate it. It has many themes and ideas, from teenage angst, to first love, mental illness and theories of time travel. Some of the motifs come straight out of mythology, for example the old witch-like madwoman ho lives as a recluse turning out to be a scientific genius who authors the the book Donnie Darko uses as a guide through the \\" tangent dimension\\" he is in. The character of Frank dressed as a giant and mysterious rabbit, is no less than a version of the Pooka reminiscent of a 1940s film \\" Harvey\\" starring James Stewart, a mischievious spirit who takes the form of a giant rabbit. I could not begin to describe the science nor would I want to ruin things for a potential viewer by revealing the end. But I will say that the film is atmospheric, and frightening in places. It is also remorselessly sad with a genuinely tragic ending. Extemely well acted by the entire caste with great cameos by Drew Barrymore and Patrick Swayze. I would highly recommend this film to anyone who enjoys involving themselves intellectually as well as enjoying the sensation of viewing good film.
B0021L8US0|5.0|District 9 is the freshest movie I have seen this summer. It's also the best sci-fi film to come along in years. It's about a government agent (Sharlto Copley) assigned to evict aliens from their home. But things go horribly wrong for him when he exposes himself to alien technology that starts turning him into one of them.The government wants to run tests on him, rather than help him. In order to survive, he has to put his life in the hands of one of the aliens who claims he can help.<br /><br />  I found Sharlto's character to not be too likable until the middle of the film. Before that, I found him to be a little annoying. But his performance and the movie get better as it goes on. The documentary parts of the movie are fresh and I haven't seen anything like them in a science fiction film.<br /><br />  While the action is very entertaining as well. I have to say I was more into the action in this film than I was from most of the big anticipated summer movies I've seen this year. The director was also more talented than most of the directors that got hired to make those movies. I liked Star Trek, but this movie was better written and directed than every other film.

The Archives is a rare look at the assets in various stages of creation for The Clone Wars, with a wealth of surprises and never-before seen moments sprinkled throughout.<br /><br />UPDATE: Now I have the set and can add that the disks are Region Free (I play them on my European BD player) and are encased in a book cover with a 62-page book. The front flap holds disk 1 and the back flap holds disks 2 and 3. The book is 64 pages (including front and back cover) of amazing artwork and behind-the-scenes pictures, scans, script pages, info, background, character drafts, etc for the entire first season. I hope some body uploads some scans or photos to the product page so you can see the detail. It is excellent!

0452289963|5.0|Wow.  The Truths shared by Tolle in this book are life-changing, life-affirming and life-giving.  Tolle clearly and responsibly affirms that these Truths are not new.  He does not take any credit for discovering anything that has not always been True.  I am re-reading this book over and over and still discovering deeper and deeper meaning for my life.  So much of what is said resonates from deep within me and affirms what I have believed to be true for all of my adult life.  I have bought several used copies and are giving them to my children and friends.  I believe with all my being that we ARE awakening.  I feel hopeful.  As a life-long Christian, I have struggled for decades with not being able to make sense of some of the traditional Christian \\"language\\", creeds, doctrine, etc.  Tolle has helped me to see that there is a whole new world of possibility open to me in re-discovering the true meaning in the teachings of Jesus of Nazareth.  For other believers who stuggle, I also highly recommend reading \\"Why Christianity Must Change Or Die\\" by Shelby Spong.

B00001OH7G|5.0|Many non-jazz live recordings are slightly guilty pleasures: souvenirs of rowdy nights or sweaty seductions.  No such fears exist for this recording; it is a picture of a guitarist and his working band firing on all cylinders.  Rory Gallagher cut this with his group after some five plus years of constant touring.  Then, too, he was one of only a handful of Irish musicians to play in Northern Ireland in this time of \\"The Troubles.\\" There are not many crowd noises in this disc; one can guess the audience's love for Gallagher from his totally confident display of passion and prowess. Personal favorites on this disc are his blistering version of \\"Walk on Hot Coals\\" and his acoustic work on \\"As the Crow Flies.\\"  Actually, there is not a bad cut on the disc and the sound mastering is warm and full.  Also, his band is accomplished in their support of him.   The cover art shows Gallagher with the '61 Strat which he bought for a reported 100 Irish pounds as a teen.  That was one purchase which produced a hundredfold return for Gallagher. The disc is very much recommended for anyone who loves electric blues.

0375842209|3.0|Well written and captivating. So well written that it drew me in, and enclosed me in the fears and sorrows of the time, and I found myself feeling sad about the events of the book even after I finished.  I know that all WWII and Holocaust novels must have a good dose of sorrow, but I have to be careful when I read them. If I am going through a low spot myself, I need to postpone reading this type of book until I am in a more cheerful mood.

0385341008|5.0|Loved this very moving story about wonderful Guernsey. Just returned home from a 15-day cruise, Guernsey being the last port. What a memorable port and its wonderful people. Guernsies love their port and are very proud of it. After reading the wonderful, detailed warm story about the local people during World War II, it makes Guernsey so much more real. This is a very moving tale, told in personal letters. Love the humor. Laughed out loud while reading it many times.<br /><br />Heard of the book during our guided bus tour of Guernsey. Our very knowledgeable (and best of our trip!) tour guide was unaware of the book. A couple of passengers returned to a shop on one of our stops and purchased the book for our driver. I know he will so love it.<br /><br />A great read!

His English is perfect, his German also, and since this book vibrates between the languages, his facility astonished me.

0143113100|5.0|This is an important inspirational book for anyone that has or knows someone with a mental problem such as a stroke or a learning disability.

Knowledge in this book has the ability to transform the lives of millions of people in a way that will benefit their lives and those around them.  I do think chapter four goes too deep into the description of sexual acts associated with internet pornography but the reset of this chapter and the rest of this book has been a life changing experience.  The true stories in this book have greatly motivated me to do more with my life.  This book has been like beautiful music to my eyes and a needed stimulus to awaken my mind. After reading this book I purchased five more copies to send out to family members.

0312427999|1.0|History has always been distorted by the anti-capitalists, or so-called communists and leftists. There are serious mistakes regarding the brazilian historical facts, so make sure you'll read a good historic book covering the years prior to the military coup and the military dictatorship. The communist groups acting in Brazil were well trained for war and they may have killed far more innocent people and soldiers than the military did. The present success of brazilian economy was the result of neoliberal ideas implemented by past administrations. The current government lead by the workers party, has legalized corruption, has conspired to shut down democratic institutions and has fought free press. This is the anti-liberal government in action. The nation's president has \\"miraculously\\" become an extremely wealthy men, as well as his associates. The legacy of this leftist administration has mined all of our chances to compete in the future. Similar to what happened during the military dictatorship, where all excessive public spending and corruption ended the miracle of 13% year growth. If there has been a coup, this has been conducted by the lefts, that distort history on their behalf and that fight for a form of government that has been shown to privilege a few ones and maintained vast populations in poverty. They have never fought for democracy!
B001PR0YBM|5.0|Ham! This movie was so cute. I like how she liked ham :) I also loved the driving scenes they were epic! I think it is a good moral movie because it teaches people to love one another for what they really are, great movie for kids. o_O
B000WS4QJG|5.0|I already knew that I would love this CD/DVD because I bought the record album when it first came out in 1982, and the cassette when it first came out!  This is an excellent CD/DVD set, at a reasonable price!  Don't hesitate to buy this set, especially if you are an MJ fan!  Trust me, you won't be disappointed!  I am a 65+ year old female, and I am a \\"huge\\" MJ fan, and have been ever since he was little and first came on the scene, with the Jackson Five!  (May Michael rest in peace.)

B000F8O35U|3.0|I was happy that the DVD played just fine, but I was a little disappointed in the color of the cover- which looked like a color copy.    It lead me to believe this product may be bootlegged, then again I can't be sure because it had all the inserts inside.     After all, I was able to watch the movie with no fuss.
B000089RV6|1.0|The reason I gave this one star is because I HATE that song where the singer sings, \\"Dirty deeds, thundercheek!  Dirty deeds and the thundercheek!\\"    WHAT IS THE THUNDERCHEEK!?!?!?  That's SO annoying.

0307269981|5.0|I read the awesome first book in Stieg Larsson's trilogy, \\"The Girl With the Dragon Tatoo,\\" but it was a while ago and I'm sure I forgot a lot of what happened in it between reading that one and the second book. Despite that, \\"The Girl Who Played With Fire\\" held together well for me, and it might also work for anyone who has not read the first book. But Lisbeth Salander is such an awesome, knock-out character in both that I can't imagine anyone not wanting to start with the first in this trilogy. (It's on sale now with free super-saver shipping, so get both books!)<br /><br />Lisbeth is a heroine unlike any I have ever encountered. There's a part of me that wants to be just like her. She doesn't get mad; she gets even--but she doesn't have to brag about it or even let on what she's done. Imagining the \\"WTF?\\" reactions of those who have crossed her is a delight! The closest I can think of to Lisbeth in the popular culture is Trinity from \\"The Matrix,\\" but Trinity pales in comparison to Lisbeth. I can hardly wait to see who they cast to play her in the movies--which they just HAVE to make.<br /><br />\\"The Girl Who Played With Fire\\" has a good bit of complexity in terms of the necessary but peripheral characters: the investigative teams, mainly. I don't know how many of them are likely to show up in the third book, but I finally just let go of trying to keep track of all of them and followed the action, trusting that (if needed) Larsson will catch me up on the minor characters later.<br /><br />I also like very much the Swedish names and places and the decidedly non-Puritanical feel to the work. (I doubt I'm pronouncing the Swedish correctly to myself as I read--\\"Blomkvist,\\" for me, is \\"blum-qwuist,\\" for example--but I get close enough that, to my untrained American ear, it all sounds deliciously strange and authentically Swedish.)<br /><br />The ending: OMG, the ending! I kept waking up in the middle of the night, having to read some more, and when I finally hit the very end, at about 4 a.m., I would have just about killed to have the next book to keep reading.ery end, at about 4 a.m., I would have just about killed to have the next book to keep reading.

1416955070|5.0|This book is a must read.  For those of you who read and loved Harry Potter, you must pick up this trilogy.  I applaud Cassandra Clare and her wonderful imagination.  I ordered City of Ash and City of Glass to complete the trilogy.  I am on Book Two-City of Ash and it is wonderful.  Full of adventure and mystery in a wonderful world made up of humans; half humans; and creatures.  This is marketed as a teen read but it offers great entertainment for adults as well.  I look forward to more creations by Cassandra Clare.

B00004U8P9|4.0|Don't dream it, be it!<br /><br />That is the motto of the hedonistic main character and self-proclaimed \\"Sweet Transvestite\\", Frank N. Furter, (the incredible and unabashed Tim Curry), in the cult classic film The Rocky Horror Picture Show.  What started out as a Broadway play in England became, (after we here in the States warmed up to it a bit), a widely-loved and highly re-created piece of glitz, glam and transvestites that parodies the worlds of science fiction and horror.<br /><br />Barry Bostwick and Susan Sarandon star as Brad and Janet, a newly engaged couple who end up at Dr. Furter's mansion after their car gets a flat tire.  They just want to use the phone to call for help.  They don't realize that as soon as they step through the door, their lives will be changed forever!<br /><br />Richard O'Brien, who wrote the screenplay, the script and the music for the film, stars as Riff Raff, Dr. Furter's assistant and \\"handyman\\".  He and the rest of the group harbor a deeper secret that will evolve into the science fiction-like conclusion of the film.<br /><br />Magenta, (played by Patricia Quinn), is the mansion's maid and Riff Raff's sister, with whom she shares an unusually close bond.  She also shares her bedroom with Columbia.<br /><br />Columbia, (Nell Campbell), is a groupie to the clan and was apparently brought to the mansion by, and had a former relationship with, Dr. Furter.  She was also involved with Eddie, (Meat Loaf), an ex-delivery boy who has been frozen somewhere in the mansion after a portion of his brain was harvested for Dr. Furter's human creation, Rocky Horror.<br /><br />Rocky, (Peter Hinwood), is Dr. Furter's creation and his embodiment of all that he believes to be masculine and muscular.  Furter will stop at nothing to protect his prized creation.  Rocky is mute, save for his brief participation in musical numbers.  He allows himself to be seduced later on by the no-longer-as-uptight Janet, much to the chagrin of everyone.<br /><br />Dr. Scott, (Jonathan Adams), is Eddie's uncle and Brad and Janet's former teacher.  He shows up at the mansion when he realizes that Eddie has gone missing and suspects that this is where he may have ended up.  Unfortunately, he's a bit too late.<br /><br />The group believes in pleasure to the highest ilk, from pansexuality to lavish musical numbers, anything and everything goes.  And we get to learn about these events through the narrator, the criminologist, played by Charles Gray.<br /><br />The soundtrack is filled with catchy, high-powered gems.  \\"Time Warp\\" will have you dancing right along, the criminologist giving you the steps as you go.  \\"Hot Patootie\\" is Eddie's only number but a toe-tapper nonetheless.

0743455967|5.0|I picked this book up because an uncommonly long stream of friends persisted with \\"Ya know, you really ought to read Stephen King's book On Writing. It's very good, and it'll make you laugh.\\"  Having picked up the book, turned the first page a sceptic, and the last page a believer, what I'd say to anyone that has ever even THOUGHT of being a writer, and anyone that has any curiousity at all about one of America's most successful writers, is \\"Ya know, you really ought to....it's very good, and it will make you laugh.\\"  And laugh, and laugh.<br /><br />If you do fancy yourself a writer, you'll have at least a few red-faced moments as you read some of the items on King's \\"Please!  Don't!\\" list.  His \\"Do!\\" list is enthralling.  King's autobiographical tales are full of potent humor, and at the same time hearty food for the soul of any potential or struggling writer, or anyone in a relationship with one, or anyone that even KNOWS a writer or struggling writer.  Yeah, you've got it:  virtually anyone would enjoy this book.<br /><br />Any more info would help you realize that this is one serious and hilarious work, maybe King's best ever, but the very best way to realize this is to just get this book, and to settle in for some serious pleasure.  Ya know...you really oughta read this book!
B001GSV3EC|5.0|Since buying \\"Live at Ronnie Scott's\\" it's been on high rotation both in my home and in my car.  In, fact, I think I've found a way to drive my wife out of the house!  It's live, it's not perfect, but the band plays with passion and feeling.  At first, I thought Vinnie's drumming was intrusive, but the more I listen the less it bothers me.  The sound reproduction on this CD is great - crisp!  Jeff Beck's playing always sounded so mature, even as a younger man.  Now, well - it's like finely burnished mahogany.  I have to sign up to get the DVD now.  Don't forget the little Aussie bass player, too.  This is a classic.
0307266303|5.0|Amazing book to read. Finished in three days. Had great charater development and how they tied into the story. Interesting how he describes the research on how we evolved into born runners.  I have always been a athlete and didn't mind running, but have been plagued by 2 ACL replacements, makes me want to drop the running shoes and go barefoot.  Highly recommend and wouldn't be suprised if a movie was made.
B00127RAJY|5.0|This is an awesome and very effective workout.  I am already at a healthy weight, but I was looking to tone up and lose some of the flabby areas.  Mission accomplished!  I'm a fairly active person and most definitely not new to working out, but this workout kicked my butt.   Jillian does a great job!
B000092ZYX|3.0|Radiohead<br />Hail to the Thief; 2003<br />Capitol Records<br /><br />My Rating: 58/100<br /><br />It's hard to complain about a Radiohead record of any kind. After all, this is one of only a few bands in recent memory to score a string of three near-perfect albums (THE BENDS, OKC, KID A). Given the rousing success of IN RAINBOWS, Radiohead has pretty much cemented their status as the grand champions of left-field pop music. And while there are quite a few great tracks on THIEF, the record suffers from being a little TOO conventional and overly glum (yes, Radiohead can be overly glum). It all begins with the title. In my book, Radiohead's brilliance lies precisely in their indirect manner of expression. I'm used to a band that skirts the fringes of our present reality, mining the subconscious dread and paranoia fear that haunt us all. I'd much rather leave the political rants to the Rage Against the Machines and Sean Penns of the world. Still, themes aside, THIEF might be a five star record if the production weren't so LA. I know the band says they were going for a LIVE feels with these songs, but much of THE BENDS was recorded live, and sounded more raw than this. Overall, I still rather enjoy this record, because, once again, it's Radiohead. But I'd only just place this above PABLO HONEY in ranking the albums.<br /><br />Cohesion (4/5)<br />Consistency (3/5)<br />Concept (4/5)<br />Consequence (4/5)<br /><br />Tracks:<br /><br />1. 2+2=5 (5/5)<br />2. Sit Down, Stand Up (5/5)<br />3. Sail to the Moon (4/5)<br />4. Backdrifts (4/5)<br />5. Go to Sleep (3/5)<br />6. Where I End and You Begin (3/5)<br />7. We Suck Young Blood (2.5/5)<br />8.

1577314808|5.0|The best book I ever read in my life! Highly recommended to anyone - this is absolutely transformational - Feels like hearing dharma straight from Buddha (for those who brought up as Buddhists). You don't need to attach to any religion to attain 'nirvana', just understand the contents in this book and start practicing your own. You may need to read more than once, and take breaks in between to better understand the deep contents within this book.
B001EAWMGA|4.0|I liked it!  Good actors, good action, not mushy but just enough to make you wonder, good special effects, and different... and hey landing in a planet earth the Iron age, it could happen and why not!
B000LW7OWE|4.0|(Blu-ray version)  For only those, who just like me, when look for a review, they only hope to find technicals opinions, nothing about the movie, history, critical or something like that, so...  The picture is great and the sound is great too. Buy it!
B000XR4OC0|2.0|They are a bit flimsy but seem as well constructed as possible.  They have fallen apart after a short time with very minimal use.<br /><br />Considering their short lifetime, they aren't very cheap.  Even considering the charitable aspect to the company,  they should be much cheaper since they are made in China where there are questionable labor and environmental practices.  If you want to give to charity, buy from a company who uses production methods that you can be sure of, and then give the extra money to a charity that you have researched.  Don't simply accept this company's advertising strategy and think you are being beneficent.
1416550542|5.0|I loved this book!  It had everything I love in book.  Mystery, fairy tales, love, friendship and betrayal. I was a bit put off by the amount of pages, but I was so hooked that it only took me a few days to read.  I'm going to buy it so I can keep it forever!
B001TH16DI|3.0|The picture and sound are great (for the most part, though there are black level issues and some more cleaning up that could've been done), but the content isn't only a retread of the DVD releases, they're all the theatrical releases.  For exemple, the Director's Cut of that snoozefest 'Star Trek: The Motion Picture' is superior to the horrible theatrical release, but it's not included here because Paramount, no doubt, is planning to release directors' cuts and special editions in order to entice fans to shell out more money.  I predict those future BDs will each have customized disk menus, unlike these BDs which have the exact same menu on each disk, and new content.  The only thing new here is the Captains Summit which doesn't even include all the captains of all the shows... where are Janeway and Archer?  (Though it is fun to watch William Shatner in all his manic craziness and hear Patrick Stewart talk about what an \\"ass\\" he was at the beginning of TNG.)<br /><br />Yes, I am one of the suckers who bought this BD set, but I've seen the movies so many, many times in all their formats I don't watch them very often anymore, anyway.  It is a shame Paramount hasn't invited any of the original cast members other than William Shatner and Leonard Nimoy to contribute to commentaries; those actors remained in those roles for so long because they, too, had fan followings and I'm sure Uhura's fans or Sulu's fans would have greatley appreciate it.  Perhaps DeForrest Kelley died before they started recording DVD commentaries (though I have a feeling he probably would have been invited to record one or more), but imagine what anecdotes the late James Doohan would have told about his days on the set, stories now lost forever.<br /><br />Shame on me for not researching this BD set more thoroughly before buying.  If I had, I would've waited until the proper release is made somewhere down the road, just like I'm not going to buy the theatrical release of 'The Lord of the Rings' on blu-ray--I want it all!it all!

B000CCD0HQ|5.0|I Like this cd a lot. I have been a zz top fan since the 1970's and 1980's This cd is not really hard rock as hard rock goes but is like mild rock. ZZ Top has put this cd together so that you can listen to it without you ears ringing afterwards. The songs on it are put together really well. I think ZZ Top is still a good group to listen to and are well worth the money to go see them in concert which I have done. I think buying this cd is well worth the money.

1601251505|4.0|A much prettier version of D&D 3.5 w/ some of the proud nails removed. DMG and PH in one book. In other words, if you've been following Pathfinder Roleplaying Game (PFRPG), pretty much exactly what you should be expecting to get.<br /><br />Did I mention this book is beautiful? Huge, sewn binding, ink that doesn't smear, amazing art (including armor that doesn't appear to do double duty as S&M gear). The physical quality of this book is 5 stars, and it's a steal at $50.00.<br /><br />The game itself, in its attempt to clean up the biggest problems with 3.5, intoduces some great ideas. Enter Combat Maneuver Bonus (CMB) and Combat Maneuver Defense (CMD), which act in tandem to unify combat maneuver resolution mechanics. The math may need some tweaking, but the idea is sound and delivers a noticeable effect in speeding up the use of maneuvers.<br /><br />But for the most part, under the (very pretty) hood, this is just mostly 3.5. Which, again, is to be expected. If you really enjoyed 3.5, and/or you main concerns are easily addressed with houserules, this is a five-star book. There is also Paizo's great content to consider, which just sweetens the pot.<br /><br />But (and this shouldn't be a secret to anyone):<br /><br />If you dislike D&D 3.5, you probably won't care for Pathfinder. I don't think it is different enough to really turn many people around. For those folks, this book is probably 3 (or even 2) stars.
B0002VEPRQ|5.0|everything went smooth. I got the movie when I should have and it was flawless.
B001FB55H6|1.0|It is not entertainment to see scenes of dogs playing tug-of-war with a little girl's severed leg still attached to the foot, to see one of the \\"heroes?\\" repeatedly burying a hatchet in a guy's head, another \\"hero?\\" shooting a pregnant girl who wanted him to help take responsibilty for the baby, or seeing a man's arms cut off with an electric metal cutter. It's sick, folks.  At the end of this excrutiatingly long movie (3+ hours), I was ready to say \\"A pox on all your houses.\\"
1433503794|5.0|I have many study Bibles, but without question, this is absolutely the best.  It is the most user-friendly, and the format is very appealing.  It makes you want to spend more time in God's word.  Maps are placed throughout the text, when and where you would like to find them.  Commentaries and aids are extensive, relevant and conservative.  Caution--this is not a Bible most people will carry around.  It is thick and heavy for a Bible.

0312330537|5.0|I bought this book an a whim at the airport when I realized that I had accidently packed my other book.  What a pleasant accident.  I have really enjoyed this book.  I love the characters varying personalitites and the story as a whole.  Roberts writing style is very enjoyable, but can be overdone at times, particularly when talking about romantic love.  This book can be quite dark, so if you don't enjoy hearing about the darker side of life you may want to skip this one.  Overall, I thought it was a great book that was well written and I would highly recommend it to anyone looking to be transported.

I love that the lead vocals float above the backing vocals at times, and then just disappear into the backing vocals at others.     Standout tracks:  2 Weeks* (My personal favorite)  Cheerleader   All We Ask  Foreground    Other favorites:  Southern Point  Fine for Now  While You Wait for the Others    I realize most of the album is included in the above list but it really is a top notch album.

B001FB55H6|1.0|If you enjoy being bored and come away from the movie depressed, then this is the movie for you.  They spent way too much time building the characters. The story line was slow and couldn't end fast enough.  I kept thinking the story would improve but it just kept getting darker and darker.  When it ended we were left extremely drained and very depressed.  I felt sorry for the actors for having to work with such a horrible script.  I hope they find better scripts and directors to work with.  It's not even worth the ONE Star rating, but i was forced to give it a rating in order to submit my review.

And I have to say that this book was definitely living up to her standards... but in a different way. It's not comparable to any of her other novels. I had fallen in love with Kinsella's chick-lit formula: boy meets girl and they fall in love, but this one deviates slightly from the norm, but I still loved it nonetheless. Kinsella has a way of creating likable and identifiable characters. But rather than focusing on a cute love story, it shines a light more on finding ones self and learning to love and appreciate family and friendship. There were several times that I felt that I identified with Lara, being the hopeless romantic. I feel like every girl has had \\"that\\" moment in her life. And I simply adore Sadie and all her quirks. She cracked me up quite a few times. All in all, it was a LOVELY summer read. I definitely recommend it!

B000UNYJXQ|5.0|No matter where you stand on the US healthcare debate, Sicko brings a human face to the numbers and dollars.  And it reminds us that for thousands of years the issue has confronted humanity, from the Good Samaritan to the 9-11 rescue worker. While making a very good case that the United States can and should do a better job at caring for its people, Sicko does not answer, \\"How?\\"  And if you watch closely, within the examples of horrid experiences that some have had with the present healthcare system, you can see healthcare providers struggling with the balance between dollars and care.  I salute Mr. Moore for a timely (pre-Barrack Obama), thoughtful and much needed work.

B00000JQFM|5.0|This was Joe's introduction to the masses back in 1987-88.  It won the best overall album from Guitar Player magazine back in '89 so those who insist on insulting this cd are in the distant minority.  There are several great tracks, The 'Lords of Karma' being my favorite with the dynamic 'Circles' being a close second.  The bass lines are nothing fancy, and Joe sometimes is capable of going over the top, but that's OK because he's basically showing everyone what he's got in his tank, and it's full high test.

B00063EMJ6|1.0|I never understodd the nastalga behind this guy he can't even sing.  The only song by this dude I can handle is \\"Rockin' in the free world\\" and even that song is nothing special, the rest on this album are just annoying.  Another under talented overrated hack.
B000000OTU|2.0|I feel that Aerosmith lost some of it's edge in the 90's. I was not a fan of \\"Get A Grip\\", and I haven't given a chance for \\"Nine Lives\\". I hate half the songs on here like \\"Crying\\", \\"Crazy\\", \\"Blind Man\\", \\"Janie's Got A Gun\\". I feel that this was a flake off to Geffen records as they weren't able to get a lucrative deal out of them. I found the songs from \\"Permanent Vacation\\" that are represented here are the best songs on the album, and \\"Living On The Edge\\" is just o.k. Otherwise this is a poor excuse for a greatest hits compilation.

B0012GMUSQ|3.0|I used to have this, but to be honest I was tired of it after 24 hours, or at least the one song \\"Got Me Wrong\\". I had to play it again to see if 17 years made the difference, or not. It still isn't a classic, but I have been able to find some good in this after all. \\"Brother\\" sounds good, and \\"Wrong Turn\\" is pretty good. \\"Am I Inside?\\" has it's moments, but \\"Got Me Wrong\\" I don't think I'll ever like the song again. It's a mind tripper all right, but it turns bad with the key change, or at least in my opinion. This is just a 4 song e.p. to give the audience something new until \\"Dirt\\" was completed.

0765350386|5.0|Personally, I don't get the chance to read very often with my busy schedule. But, I finally took the time to sit down and read The Final Empire (Mistborn). It's an awesome book! I definitly recommend it. There were some parts that were a little drawn out, but that happens in a large majority of books. The plot kept me wanting to read more, \\"what's going to happen?...\\" Something you need to keep in mind when reading this book is, it's building up to the other two books. Most of it is about getting an army together, Vin learning her abilities, etc. But, even though it's a building-up book and not a climax, it's still worth the time to read.
B00005QGAX|5.0|...You go bad!. That's what Michael Jackson did. After coming off a monster hit like \\"Thriller\\", it would seem that the pressure would be extremely high when it came time to make the follow up. \\"Thriller\\" broke records, sold massive amounts of copies, had a string of huge hit singles, and re-defined pop music and music videos. What do you do after that?. Well, in Michael Jackson's case, you do it again!. The resulting album was one that was the next step in the evolution of Jackson and his music. In ways, I find myself loving and thinking that \\"Bad\\" is even better than \\"Thriller\\". I know I am not alone. It's almost repulsive to think that some critics thought the album was a disappointment because it sold only a \\"mere\\" 30 million copies worldwide, compared to the even bigger sales of \\"Thriller\\". Who could even think that?!. It's mind boggling.    The album starts off with the title track, \\"Bad\\". Obviously, it's a Michael Jackson classic, and perfect for the new tougher image he was trying to make with himself and his music. What I didn't know was that the song was originally intended to be a duet with Prince. I had no idea. \\"The Way You Make Me Feel\\" is next, and I have always loved this song. Great catch, great melody, and a great pop hook. The next three songs all have their appeal, but they are mostly filler. \\"Speed Demon\\" is pretty fun and creative, but mostly forgettable. \\"Liberian Girl\\" is slow and pretty. \\"Just Us Friends\\" is a duet with Stevie Wonder, and it's a very catchy pop tune that is very 1987. The rest of the album is hit after hit. Like 'Thriller', \\"Bad\\" could almost be a Greatest Hits CD!. \\"Another Part Of Me\\" is a catchy, likeable song, but lightweight. Still, it was a top 20 hit, peaking at #11. \\"Man In The Mirror\\" is one of the best songs Jackson has ever recorded. The theme of helping those in need runs throughout his career, beginning with \\"We Are The World\\", and continues here. One of his greatest, most inspiring songs ever. \\"I Just Can't Stop Loving You\\" is a very dreamy ballad, and was the first single released. Sending his tougher sound even higher was \\"Dirty Diana\\", a fantastic song with a slow build to a rocking chorus. \\"Smooth Criminal\\" is another MJ highlight, with one of his most recognizable melodies. Who didn't want to know if Annie was okay?. \\"Leave Me Alone\\" was a great song and an even greater video. This special edition comes with two tracks left off of the CD. The first, \\"Streetwalker\\", has become one of my favorite Michael Jackson songs ever. Insanely catchy and funky, it should have been on the album. Heck, it should of been a single!. The other is a pretty ballad called \\"Fly Away\\", which would of been a nice album closer.    \\"Bad\\" came out in 1987. There was a five year gap between this album and \\"Thriller\\". By the time Michael got around to this one, some things had changed. Music changed a bit, people, tastes, the world. He rose to the challenge and made an album of the times that, 22 years later, still sounds as great and fresh as ever. There are some synth sounds, especially on \\"Just Us Friends\\" and \\"Another Part Of Me\\" that show it's age, but that's okay. That's part of the fun. Everything else is just as gripping and fantastic as it was upon it's original release. That's really a testament to the music and the songwriting, all of which, except for one song, was done competely by Michael. We always hear about the flash and epic-ness of Michael and his music and videos, and his personal life woes, but rarely do you hear much about how much of a brilliant songwriter he is. Truly one of the best.    In the end, \\"Bad\\" was an album that met the bar raised previously by 1982's \\"Thriller\\". It was a strong album that I find myself listening to more and more than any of the others. \\"Thriller\\" is what it is and what it became, but \\"Bad\\" is just as good, if not even better. \\"Bad\\" had 8 hit singles. \\"Thriller\\" had 7. 5 of the 8 went to #1. \\"Thriller\\" had 2. Going back to some critics assesment that this album was a disappointment in terms of being compared to \\"Thriller\\" are completely false. \\"Bad\\" was not 'Thriller 2'. Nor did it have to be. It was the next step in an artists' career. It's a genuine, bonafide classic all on it's own.
B000WGWQG8|5.0|HBO continues to produce some of the best TV around.  From \\"The Sopranos\\" to \\"The Wire\\" to \\"Rome\\" to \\"Deadwood,\\" the cable channel is doing something extremely right.  Add \\"John Adams\\" to the list of great television events brought about by these folks.    Paul Giamatti may have come to national attention as the lovable shlub Miles in \\"Sideways,\\" but John Adams provides Giamatti with the role of a lifetime in one of America's most important Founding Fathers.  Indeed, the unwritten subtitle of this series could be, \\"The Forgotten Founding Father.\\"    By bringing to brilliant light the story of Adams' life and critical importance to our young nation, this series reminds us that it took more than Ben Franklin, George Washington, and Thomas Jefferson to give birth to our country.  (Of course, the series exercises its own form of prejudice by completely ignoring James Madison, who played more than a minor role in the whole business!)  Adams was a critical Massachusetts leader before the Revolution, he was a leader in the negotiation of the Declaration of Independence, he was a critical diplomat for the new country in Europe, and he provided crucial leadership as Vice President, President, and elder statesman.      The strengths of this series are many, but stem primarily from relying heavily on David McCullough's stellar biography on Adams.  His \\"rotundancy\\" is shown as he was - warts and all.  Adams was a brilliant, vain, pompous, ambitious man, and yet he channeled so much of himself into forming and guiding our young nation that it is impossible to say that without Adams, there would not be a United States as we understand it today, and perhaps not at all.    The movie also humanizes Adams.  We see his early struggles with the notion of independence as he takes the British side in the Boston Massacre, defending the British soldiers accused of murder even as his own cousin, Sam Adams, lobbies for their hanging.  John Adams is reluctant to break away from Britain as hesees America as dangerously close to mob rule.  His journey to ardent foe of Britain is a joy to watch.    \\"John Adams\\" could also be called \\"The Adams Family.\\"  Laura Linney almost steals the movie with her performance as Adams' beloved and brilliant wife Abigail.  This self-educated woman was a paragon of virtue and wisdom, and her partnership with her husband elevated John to what he was to become.  These two experience more joys and sorrows in their 54-year marriage(!) than most families experience in several generations.  John and Abigail provide the emotional high points of the series, and there are many.  Their correspondence, including references to each other as \\"Dearest Friend,\\" are incredibly touching.    Look for well-rounded performances from a wide cast of characters, but Giamatti and Linney remain the anchor for this first-rate production.  Stephen Dillane is particularly fine as Thomas Jefferson, Adams' friend, then nemesis, then friend.  Tom Wilkinson, as always, is excellent in his role as Ben Franklin.  Sarah Polley shines in her small role as Adams' darling daughter Nabby.  And Rufus Sewell makes for a satisfying \\"villain\\" in Alexander Hamilton, a huge thorn in Adams' plump side.    This series should be required viewing for all high school students who want a realistic, warts-and-all depiction of the birth of our nation and the struggles and sacrifices (and triumphs) of one of the most important Americans who ever lived.  Kudos to all involved.

B001GGPBUG|5.0|This is a remarkable story and a remarkable woman. She suffered genital mutilation at the hands of her grandmother at a young age and as a teen was hard core head to toe covered Muslin in Nairobi Kenya. Blessed with the ability to read and speak English. This led her and a few of her classmates to devour romance paperbacks. Books that were about a life that none of them could even comprehend.<br /><br />  Little by little she began to wonder about the crazy life she was living, and if the the life depicted in the books was true. When she reached the age of majority her often absentee father (they didn't know it but he had another family) arranged a marriage to a Canadian Muslim.<br /><br />  On the flight to Canada, there was a stopover in Germany and knowing a family there she sought refuge as a refugee. While waiting for the government to make a decision about her staus she snuck over the border into Holland, where she bloomed as a woman's right activist. Even becoming a Dutch legislator. Eventually, she outraged Muslim men. Her life was threatened and she now lives in hiding.<br /><br />  Ayaan Hirsi Ali is a true role model for the beaten down women of Islam.

I notice some people hated this book, perhaps because they were offended on the part of India. I believe they miss the point, though, as the two stories here are 1) the journey the narrator has undertaken - grippingly told, forcing me to read into the late hours and 2) the description of a world were there is no black or white (even though the narrator tries to portray it as either), something I think is true for any country on the planet.  That this was a debut really impress me, this man can tell a story!

B00000IREA|3.0|[Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book \\"Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!\\" Get it at Amazon.]<br /><br />For decades I had been meaning to watch this to see if Jane Fonda was as gorgeously displayed by Roger Vadim as advertised (and as reported by my horny friends).  Well, yes.  But the rest of the movie--high camp?  Interesting sci-fi spoof?  Satire on the genre?  Well, no, but there are some eyebrow-raising and rather bizarre flights of fancy by Vadim including some creepy children in an icy landscape who bean Fonda with a rock, knock her out and tie her up.  They have little dolls with piranha teeth that they sic on her luscious tied-up bod, drawing some very red blood to contrast with her white skin.  You get the picture.<br /><br />Another interesting idea is that of the labyrinth containing the \\"good\\" people outside the city of all sins.  Vadim reverses Dante's Inferno and puts the angels and other people in hell while the evil doers live in their decadence in the not so fair city.  Fonda rides on the back of an angel with wings (John Phillip Law) while shooting down the \\"leather\\" storm troopers from the city in their flying machines.  Ka-boom!  Jane doesn't miss but of course she does get captured and...well, scantily clad Jane in chains or rather ropes in the city of evil...  You get the picture.<br /><br />Roger Vadim gained international fame as the director of \\"Et Dieu... cr&eacute;a la femme\\" (1956) starring the amazingly beautiful Bridget Bardot.  He seemed to have a way with actresses, especially young, beautiful and aspiring ones.  It was quite a coup to somehow capture the heart or perhaps it was the ambition of the young and beautiful Jane Fonda.  One can see that part of his technique was to really put the lady on display.  Here in Barbarella, Fonda more or less undresses for the camera as the opening credits roll.  It's a kind of \\"you gotta have a gimmick\\" strip tease as she is turned upside down and sideways by the seemingly lack of gravity in her spaceship as she dodges behind the text of the opening credits.  This peek-a-boo would be quite titillating were I still 19 years old (or what the heck, 50).  Regardless the point is the full (as much as possible) display of Fonda who does indeed look gorgeous.  But that would not be enough, not nearly enough for the actress that Jane would become.  She exclusively holds the camera for much of the first part of the movie in her space ship as she re-robes, talks with the President of Earth, and moves about and begins her space faring mission looking for \\"Duran Duran\\" (yes, they got their name from this flick).  Her skin is flawless, her limbs elegant, her eyes beautifully made up in the dark sixties style.  The camera loves her, Vadim loves her, the audience loves her, Jane loves her.<br /><br />To be candid I did not watch the entire movie.  But that is more a problem of age (mine) than it is of the movie which was at least as good as most sci-fi spoofs and a bit more creative.  However if you don't find Jane Fonda attractive, you won't even be able to watch as much as I did.<br /><br />--Dennis Littrell, author of \\"Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!\\"wn and sideways by the seemingly lack of gravity in her spaceship as she dodges behind the text of the opening credits.

B002DKGWSE|3.0|Perhaps I should have re-watched the original \\"The Last House on the Left\\" before I saw this re-imagining of the violently, brutal horror classic, but I think I can remember enough to write a balanced review. The original had that unrelenting graphically violent nature that is rooted around the premise of the lost of innocence, that left its mark 37 or so years ago. Wes Craven was still trying to find his style during the time, and now, he has been trying to revamp his past brainchild such as \\"The Hills Have Eyes\\" and even has a remake of \\"A Nightmare on Elm Street\\" in the works. This remake, while not as exploitive and stomach-turning as the original, is a decent entry in the books of horror.<br /><br />Reeling from the death of their son, Ben, the Collingwoods made up of John (Tony Goldwyn), Emma (Monica Potter), and swimmer daughter Mari (Sara Paxton) decide to go up to their lake house for a little renewal and \\"family bonding\\". 17-year old daughter Mari, however, has her different idea of fun as she hooks up with her friend Paige (Martha MacIsaac) that ends up with the two meeting up with a young man named Justin (Spencer Treat Clark) in a small motel. It turns out Justin is the son of a recently escaped convict named Krug (Garret Dillahunt), who along with his wicked girlfriend Sadie (Riki Lindhome), and Francis (Aaron Paul) plan to get out of dodge as soon as possible. Things turn for the worst as Mari and Paige is taken hostage and something truly horrific happens. Later on, Krug and his crew find themselves stranded and they seek refuge in the last house on the left...the very house owned by Mari's parents.<br /><br />Directed by Dennis Iliadis, this re-imagining captures the main premise of the 70's original with some small and some major differences in the screenplay. While the original was utterly violent and exploitive; it was a fine product of the times unleashed to an unprepared audience much like \\"I Spit on Your Grave\\" which gave it an image/title of \\"exploitation classic\\", this new remake does try to give certain more fleshed out aspects; such as morality and vengeance, as well as a cautionary tale for teenagers. I find bloody vengeance films a lot of fun to watch, and \\"The Last House on the Left\\" is all about set ups, as we see destiny plays its hand in order to mess with both our good guys and bad guys.<br /><br />While the original was quick and painful, this remake decides to take its time. The film tries to transcend the usual horror clich&eacute;s, overload of special effects and torture sequences in favor of subtle characterization and careful composition in its storytelling. The raw intensity of the original is lost, and what we see in its place is some subtle tricks in its photography that meanders and dwells on some emotion as we become privy to Mari's ordeal. Director Iliadis tries to lean towards artistry in place of raw brutality--don't get me wrong, the film is pretty brutal, it just follows a different approach. This remake is also less sadistic than the original, but it does definitely generate more sympathy through characterization rather than through its horrific scenes with grand displays of anger and rage. The brutality represented in the original was pure unrelenting violence that displays humanity's sadistic side; it may prove a bit surreal that may distance some viewers from its emotions. The rape scene in the film is as disturbing and savage as in the original with no touches of crude humor. (No inept cops)<br /><br />What is also interesting is the fact that Krug and his crew are brutal but they are brutal when provoked; it feels like they were just doing the brutal deeds out of necessity of the situation. When Mari and Paige tried to escape, their reaction is violent, and without regret. I'm still certain that the two would still be killed after all is said and done; but the script does try to bring some questions as to what would have happened if they just cooperated? However, the direction and screenplay gives no room to feel some sympathy towards Krug and his crew; they are vile, evil and despicable. They really deserved what is coming for them, which allows for the viewer to root for John and Emma all the way. The only one worthy of sympathy would be our mislead character Justin, and not entirely by much. The antagonists this time around are no mere caricatures and they feel a little more real. Krug is presented as a lethal, calculating bad guy who may have just left the Collingwoods after a night's rest, despite the temptations of their baser killer instincts but then again, you`d never know since Francis is somewhat taken by pretty Emma.<br /><br />Purists are bound to be a little upset as even the trailers have shown Mari surviving the rape and while I do somewhat agree with their complaints, Mari's death proved to be the major catalyst for the parents' lust for brutal revenge, this time around the script tries to incorporate a different reason for Emma and John to take the offensive. They have to fight for their barely alive daughter's survival, so they have the added motivation to lay waste upon Krug and his crew of despicable characters. Clues as to how they discover that they were the offenders that attacked their daughter are also handled well.

It is a different film that can stand on its own.<br /><br />Recommended! [3 ½ Stars]m to feel some sympathy towards Krug and his crew; they are vile, evil and despicable. They really deserved what is coming for them, which allows for the viewer to root for John and Emma all the way. The only one worthy of sympathy would be our mislead character Justin, and not entirely by much. The antagonists this time around are no mere caricatures and they feel a little more real. Krug is presented as a lethal, calculating bad guy who may have just left the Collingwoods after a night's rest, despite the temptations of their baser killer instincts but then again, you`d never know since Francis is somewhat taken by pretty Emma.     Purists are bound to be a little upset as even the trailers have shown Mari surviving the rape and while I do somewhat agree with their complaints, Mari's death proved to be the major catalyst for the parents' lust for brutal revenge, this time around the script tries to incorporate a different reason for Emma and John to take the offensive. They have to fight for their barely alive daughter's survival, so they have the added motivation to lay waste upon Krug and his crew of despicable characters. Clues as to how they discover that they were the offenders that attacked their daughter are also handled well. I also enjoyed the scenes when the killing becomes easier for Emma and John after their first kill--all they became concerned about is getting their daughter to safety and woe unto anyone who would stand on their way.

Now in one volumne a compendium of much of this research is available for the lay reader. The China Study: The Most Comprehensive Study of Nutrition...lives up to its title. Highly recommended.

Maybe it's Diamond's writing style, maybe it is the repetition, but this book was much harder to get through than it should be. Maybe Jared Diamond needs a better editor?

Why is it that every time I order a DVD from Amazon, someone keeps the inside booklet??

Anyway, besides that, the item was perfectly fine, and the movie, of course, was excellent.
B00027JYLC|2.0|Freaks,released in February 1932,was and is a title that says as much about itself as it does about its' subject matter.It was a curiosity then and remains so to this day.Judged on its' merits as a film,and all that that implies,it comes up far short of its'intended goals.<br />Browning had previously worked with Lon Chaney who was THE master of grotesquery in his characterizations.He also had directed the horror hit Dracula the year previously.Mix this with the so called \\"Great Depression\\" and the studios desperation to keep their heads above water and looking for new ideas to intice patrons into the theatres,and you have the movie Freaks.<br />The movies' centrepiece is two midgets,Hans and Frieda(Harry and Daisy Earles-real life brother and sister).Both are part of the \\"freak\\" section of the circus performers and are engaged to be married.Enter trapeze artist Cleopatra(Olga Baclanova)who catches the eye of little Hans.She humours and eggs him on by flirting openly with him,much to Frieda's chagrin and embarrassement.Cleopatra however goes for the circus strongman Hercules(Henry Victor) and they both take great delight in humiliating Hans and the other \\"freaks\\" frequently.<br />When Cleopatra learns that Hans has alot of money she talks him into marrying her.Frieda tries to tell Hans it's a sham,but he won't listen and goes ahead with the marriage.During a reception it becomes apparent to Hans things aren't what they should be when Hercules kisses Cleopatra openly.And when the \\"freaks\\" in attendance chant that they \\"accept her\\"(Cleopatra),she becomes enraged at the thought and tells them to take a hike.During the reception she had slipped a poison into Hans drink-starting early to get rid of him and collect on his money.She carries him back to the wagon and a doctor is summoned,as she feigns innocence.She convinces the doctor but the spurned\\"freaks\\" are getting wise to the situation and keep a close watch.Sure enough when Cleopatra is alone she slips poison into Hans medicine.Hans however has gotten wise himself and spits out each dose when Cleo isn't looking.Hans has had it and decides,along with his friends,to take care of cheating/murdering Cleopatra and Hercules.When Hercules goes after his ex girlfriend Venus,who threatened to take what she knew about the two of them to the police,the \\"freaks\\" are right there.On a rain soaked,mud filled ground Hercules tries to crawl away with a knife in his side from the approaching threat,but he is eventually overtaken.At the same time Cleopatra runs screaming into the night from her wagon only to be followed by more \\"freaks\\",who get their woman.The movie ends as it had begun,with people standing around a large square enclosure,inside which is the former Cleopatra,now a \\"freak\\" and a much deformed \\"duck woman\\".<br />This slight tale of revenge was banned in a few countries around the world due to its' graphic and exploitative subject matter.It was released ,pulled,re-released again and again(parred down),but it still received terrible reviews and bombed at the box office.Actual circus performers(\\"freaks\\") as you can see were \\"used\\" heavily in the movie for authenticity.You have pinheads,a half woman-half man,more than one armless woman,siamese twins,the living torso,bird girl,a dwarf,a legless dwarf,and several others.What brings the movie down isn't so much the obviously contrived script of righting a wrong but the poor acting involved.Most of the \\"freaks\\" did fairly well all things considered,but Olga Baclanova as Cleo and her brutish boyfriend Hercules played by Henry Victor,troll for new depths in bad acting.Olga plays it way,way over the top and Victor comes along to push down them both down the slippery slope on the other side.You actually wonder what took them so long to do them in! On the other side of the coin is Venus(Leila Hyams) and Phroso(Wallace Ford),who save the film from total oblivion.Rose Dione as Madame Tetrallini also manages to make the most of her on screen time.<br />Sure one feels an empathy towards these men and women,the underbelly of the circus world,but it is an empathy that Browning unnecessarily pounds home.Not only does he show fellow \\"normal\\" circus perfomers shunning them(not generally the case in real life)just to achieve a modicum of a plot,the re-issue prologue REALLY pounds home the sympathy message by its' sermonization.At the end of the day however there just is not enough good to overcome the bad in this film.It was a brave experiment on Browning's and MGM's parts,but it didn't come off.<br />As you know the film we see today is a cut down version of the original.Unless some archive somewhere turns up a longer copy,this is the film posterity will be left with.Having said that though,I do not believe this film would have been helped by the extra footage.I think it would just have prolonged the agony and possibly made it even worse than what we have today.The film was revived some 30 years or more ago by a film enthusiast and caught on with other film devotees due to its' unsual subject matter,which caused MGM to eventually rustle through its' holdings,dig it out and dust off its' copies.It was re-released On VHS in 1990 and now it is on DVD.<br />The DVD's print here is of good quality and sound.The sound in fact has been improved since its' 1990 release on tape.You can now understand most of the dialogue,though some spoken by the circus performers are still a little hard to catch.This release contains three alternate endings to the film,a re-issue prologue,a commentary and two featurettes,one on Tod Browning and one on the movie itself.<br />In conclusion Freaks,an interesting curiosity-yes;an experiment not fulfilled or succesful-yes.An example of good film making?....definitely not.s an empathy towards these men and women,the underbelly of the circus world,but it is an empathy that Browning unnecessarily pounds home.Not only does he show fellow \\"normal\\" circus perfomers shunning them(not generally the case in real life)just to achieve a modicum of a plot,the re-issue prologue REALLY pounds home the sympathy message by its' sermonization.At the end of the day however there just is not enough good to overcome the bad in this film.It was a brave experiment on Browning's and MGM's parts,but it didn't come off.

It took me awhile to like it, But they had an old Video on tv one day, and stated liking their music, i'm trying to collect Garbage music. Cause it's really good music, And the lead singer is really pretty.  I'm not a lesbo or anyhing, but She just looks really good in some of her photo's, and I would love to copy her make-up.

B000LP6KSU|5.0|I enjoyed it. It's a little bit quirky, but that's MCR. They're different. Their music is whiny, depressing, funny, weird, and totally in touch with teens as far as the general confusion goes. lol! One thing is that they use extreme cuss words when they're not needed, so finding amended version made me REALLY happy. I give it two thumbs up...I only wish \\"three cheers for sweet revenge\\" was in a clean version because then I'd buy that one too.

B000TXZVGQ|5.0|I loved this series.  The only thing that I didn'tlike is it leaves you wanting to see more and there are no more episodes.
B001MYIXAC|5.0|I very much enjoy movies such as this. Rare gems that are not only intellectual, but also emotional and graphic. I put this on one day on the recommendation of a critic. I was hesitant, because, well, it was a critic. As I watched the movie, I was completely enraptured. The story is purely gothic, almost like a Grimm fairy tale. A young vampire befriending a lonely child, with a happy, or not so happy ending, depending on how one might view it. The young actors are excellent, especially the young actress who plays the child vampire. This movie is for smart people who love gothic flare. I highly recommend.

B001QTXM5Y|3.0|I've never read the graphic novel, but I have enjoyed other super hero movies with varying degrees, so I was willing to give this movie a fair shot at entertaining me. At the end, I got the distinct impression that a true fan probably enjoyed it more than I did, but I didn't find it a waste of time either.    If you're in the target demographic for this movie, you probably have already made up your mind about purchasing this title, so there's not much I can say to change your mind. However, if you've not seen the movie and you're not sure about buying this title, put it on your Netflix list or rent it via the Video-on-demand services and check it out for yourself before spending a lot of money on it.    I would imagine that fans want every moment they can get to soak up the scenes and character interactions, so this extended version is probably right up their alley and it was most likely made just for them. If you count yourself a fan, this is a no-brainer purchase, but you should most likely seriously consider the Blu-ray edition instead to get the best picture and sound possible.    [...]
B0024F08RO|3.0|Was loving this season till the last 5 or 6 episodes where they just kept doing the same beats over and over.  Plus, the last scene makes it unlikely I'll revisit any of the \\"Prison Break\\" episodes ever again.

You can  see one picture where michael stipe seems like  thom yorke's conscience, or another with a funny  mohawk at the back of his head. Or peter buck flying  on stage as if he was a teen, and a great mike mills  playing bass in his boxers. great moments, great format,  it's a utterly beautiful book. a whole experience.  if you're reading this, trust me, you better buy it!

B00288KNL8|3.0|Movie was pretty good. Mostly bought it for 3d aspect but watching it in 3d was bad. The glasses are the cheapy red & green glasses. In the theatre you get the clear ones which allow you to see the movies beautiful color & animation as i was hoping those glasses would be the ones included.  It was hard to watch the movie in the red & green glasses since.. everything was red and green! & it was only some parts of the animation that were 3d...and its not the kind of 3d that really makes you WOW.  Watching the original movie is 100x better.
B00004RJ74|5.0|On their way out of Texas, leaving a deadly-crime spree in their wake, two brothers (George Clooney and Quentin Tarantino) scoop up an unsuspecting family (led by Harvey Keitel) and make their way across the border into Mexico. Home-free and troubles be damned, they party it up at a local strip joint that is open from dusk till dawn. In the morning, they will receive a generous pay-day, but in the meantime, must fend off a gang of deadly and sometimes seductive vampires.<br /><br />\\"From Dusk Till Dawn\\" is a film about vampires, but you tend to forget about that in the first hour, as Tarantino's script focuses sharply on its characters. You'll feel like you're at the table with them as they share shots of whiskey, and when the excrement hits the fan, you're thrown off-balance by the complete 180 the film pulls. Now, depending on your expectations, the third act both ups the ante and makes the film, or it totally shatters the well-developed plot. If you love gore galore (hint: Robert Kurtzman, who provided special effects for the film, also conjured up the original story), this is your film. If anyone knows how to shoot a \\"shoot 'em up\\" flick, it's Robert Rodriguez, and he effortlessly transitions from character moments to over-the-top blood and guts and guns (check out Tom Savini's legendary cod-piece) at the turn of a dime. Truly professional film-making is what we have here.<br /><br />Despite the fact that the film switches it up on you just as you settle in, the end results are so much fun that it's forgivable. If you can't enjoy vampires being jack-hammered with a giant wooden-stake, then this certainly isn't the movie for you. The film is whip-smart, at times hilarious and at others, sincere. It's also got a solid cast worth noting. George Clooney plays against type, and likewise, Tarantino is less annoying than he is in his other acting roles. Harvey Keitel more or less steals the show at times, as the most professional and likable of the bunch, but you'll get a kick, no doubt, in seeing Cheech Marin playing three, count 'em, three roles in the film. \\"From Dusk Till Dawn\\" is essentially a brilliant mash-up of Tarantino's unique story-telling and characters and Robert Rodriguez's signature action and effects sequences, most certainly foreshadowing the duo's epic collaboration, \\"Grindhouse,\\" a decade later. Those expecting anything but a good time will be sorely left in the cold.bt, in seeing Cheech Marin playing three, count 'em, three roles in the film. \\"From Dusk Till Dawn\\" is essentially a brilliant mash-up of Tarantino's unique story-telling and characters and Robert Rodriguez's signature action and effects sequences, most certainly foreshadowing the duo's epic collaboration, \\"Grindhouse,\\" a decade later.

They are great and anyone who claims anything else obviously doesn't know what they are talking about.
B000AM6OQ2|3.0|'The Fog' is a decent horror movie from the talented director John Carpenter.  He was the guy who created the original 'Halloween' movie and the remake of 'The Thing'. The story is about a mysterious fog that envelopes a small town.  The fog contains a haunted ship.  The ghosts of the ship are wanting revenge from an incident that happened one hundred years earlier.  As with many horror movies, one has to suspend various logical flaws and unlikely coincidences.  But the movie is driven my the suspense and an eerie atmosphere.  The most memorable character is the female disc jockey who attempts to warn the town of the fog.  The movie has a cool ending also.

B000002J0B|3.0|I am a die hard Led Zeppelin fan, I have all of their albums, and listen to them religiously.  What seperates me from most other big fans is the fact that I find Houses of the Holy to be one of their weaker efforts.  Most people regard this as one of the best, and I don't understand why.  Of course nothing Zeppelin did was bad, this just ranks towards the bottom of their work, which is still better than the best stuff by many other bands.  Nothing of Zeppelin's could ever get less than 3 stars from me (even \\"In Through the Out Door\\")!<br /><br />There are a few things that really hurt this album's overall quality.  The major factor being that it is sandwiched in between arguably the two best Led Zep albums, ZOSO (IV) and Physical Grafitti.  Another factor is the weakness of some of the songs.  \\"The Crunge\\" with it's overusage of that cheesey synthesizer and Plant's whineyness on \\"D'yer Mak'er\\" are simply awful.  Moving on, \\"The Rain Song\\" and \\"Dancing Days\\" are both average at best.  \\"No Quarter\\" is decent, though be it a bit of a depressing dirge of a song.  \\"The Song Remains the Same\\" is above average, and the two gems are \\"The Ocean\\" and \\"Over the Hills and Far Away\\", both of these about as good as most of Zep's other greats.<br /><br />So my recommendation to the prospective buyer is if you already have most of their other albums, buy this one as a completer to your set.  Or buy it for the couple of really good tracks it contains, but don't expect much from the rest of the album.  Definitely check out most of their other albums first.

1400103282|4.0|Boomer bios are bound to be the next big publishing wave but they seem to be only dribbling out so far. iwoz, the autobiography of Steve Wozniak by himself and Gina Smith is delightful or maybe \\"amazing\\". Woz' gee-whiz attitude about life comes through in this story with lots of Amazing! and I loved it! peppered through his description of his early years. Yet for all the golly wow enthusiasm its most surprising that Woz spent years alone in this own room designing computers, because his dream of making one he could use for himself, and oh wow, the rest of us too, was so gripping.   Listening to the audio version read by Patrick Lawlor was a nice change from all the fantasy adventure on CD that I usually prefer. The choice of Lawlor was surprisingly good. I compared his narrator voice with Woz' voice in an interview online, and although the author's voice is a bit lower, Lawlor captured all the so American, so California enthusiasms and inflections in his words.   Most surprising though is the final CD. Its worth waiting through the story of creating Apple, post Apple concert promotions and yet another business creation, to hear Woz' advice for presumably young people but I expand it to all creators/makers/inventors in principle. Not to spoil it but he recommends you do the same as he and pursue your creation/device/invention alone...by yourself, putting it together as an individual pursuit. This flies in the face of most business stuff I read or listen to which emphasizes being part of the team, work together, ad nauseum. Maybe his advice is a boomer style or individual style that cannot be duplicated by others, but I strongly suspect this is what a lot of harried GenXers and Millenials need to hear.    Go to your room. Design your \\"amazing\\" thing. iWoz on audio is inspiring that way.
B00288KNJU|5.0|Well, it's happened again: another animated movie that can I describe \\"the greatest-looking animation I've ever seen!\\"  This has happened several times now in the past few years, and especially when they're available on a stunning Blu-Ray disc transfer.  (Note: three months after this, \\"UP\\" came out on Blu-Ray and surpassed this!! It just keeps getting better....)     I'm talking about the 2-D version, not the 3-D (which is not even in the same ballpark.) Forget the 3-D glasses and watch this as you would any other movi. You'll be extremely impressed at the colors and detail, and maybe just plain blown away by it all.    Not only to the colors and detail dazzle, but the inventiveness here is really fun to watch and items change from one form or color to another. In parts, it reminded me of the old Beatles' \\"Yellow Submarine\\" with its colorful cleverness.    To me, all of this made the story is secondary but that the latter isn't very interesting, too. The story is unique; quite different, with a good message getting everything you want not always being as attractive as that sounds.    The minor characters in this story, by the way: such as \\"Mr. Bobinsky,\\" \\"Miss Forcible\\" and \\"Miss Spink\\" - are a real hoot. and more fun than the main characters.  And - one last thing - adults mind find this more entertaining than kids.
B00026WU7I|5.0|A breakthrough - Dylan's country period is over for ever (I mean, he would return to the country style occasionally, but it would never remain high on the list of his priorities). The sound he's adopted here is unlike anything he'd done previously, either. If you really need some analogies, then I'd say it's closer to the sound on his early acoustic albums than anything else, in that there is little or no electric guitar on most of the tracks. On the other hand, keyboards, drums and bass guitar are featured prominently, and that's what makes the difference - Bob wouldn't switch on to complete acoustic folk again until the Nineties. So this album is also extremely quiet, extremely sad and thoughtful, with great un-psycho, but still complicated lyrics and tons o' good songs.  Love you Bob.
0792843584|5.0|Some people might like this movie for its anti-western and realistic view of the Far West. Others might just hate or won't stand its long sequences, its 220 minutes (while Once upon a time in America by Sergio Leone is 229 minutes, and The lord of the Rings 683 minutes), or the truthful exposition of the internal conflicts between the immigrants settlers and the americans. But if you take the time to shut yourself from the press' critics, take an unbiased attitude, and let yourself get engulf by this movie, you will live an adventure; whether or not you will hate it, or love it like I did.<br /><br />You have been warned. And if you can't stand watching the whole movie in one ride, try watching it like a novel; take a break from time to time.
1582701709|5.0|The CD was very good.  It is common sense information that we tend to forget.  It was refreshing to hear.  We need that boost every now and then. We do tend to forget with everyday life how our thoughts determine our outcome.  I enjoyed the CDs.  I wanted to read the book, but just have not made time.  With my commute, it was very nice to listen to something inspiring and positive while driving to and from work.
0307454541|2.0|I'm puzzled by all the rave reviews.  I found this book to be mildly interesting, but slow at times and rather cliche or contrived when describing the main character's sex life.  I also found the abuse and torture passages to be not only disturbing, which is to be expected, but at times I wondered if they were also exploitative.  That is, while they portrayed violence against women as negative, did they also use it to draw the reader in?  If so, I was not sure I was ok with having spent my money on this book.
B0001VV1GK|5.0|I bought this for my 2 year old son. He absolutely loves it. It was not difficult to put together and it holds up well. Great for both other Plan Toy cars as well as Hot Wheels or Matchbox type cars.   We have had it now for 3 years and it still looks great and has never broken. I definitley recommend this toy.
B0000009N1|5.0|Frank Zappa thought of himself as witty. Most of the time he wasn't. He had a very pimply sense of humour. Very juvenile. You can forget about all his other albums. This is the only one worth while having. It's jazz-rock of the highest standard. Absolutely sublime.
0061767581|4.0|THIS IS A GOOD BOOK- WELL IT HAD A GOOD STORY ANYWAYS. EASY READING-- BUT I THINK THAT LAUREN CONRAD IS WAY OUT OF HER LEAGUE EVEN TRYING TO WRITE. SERIOUSLY A 15-YR OLD GOING THRU HIGHSCHOOL COULD HAVE WROTE SOMETHING USING A LITTLE MORE INTELLIGENCE AND 'BIGGER WORDS'. LAUREN REALLY FLEW THRU EVERY BIT OF THE STORY AND LEFT A LOT OF PARTS OPEN. BUT MOSTLY ITS A CHILDS BOOK. SHE SKIPS AROUND ALOT AND DOESNT USE GOOD GRAMMAR OR PUNCTUATION. IM NOT A GRAMMAR NAZI BUT THIS BOOK WAS FOR A TEENAGER TO READ, NOTHING MORE.
B0007XT7V8|3.0|I ordered this used CD July 3rd.  I recieved a package from \\"Buybacks Colerain\\". It did not have THeory of a Deadman Gasoline.  It had a DVD of some B movie I never heard of.  I sent it back to Buybacks and still have not recieved the CD I ordered 7 weeks ago.  I also have not heard back from anyone.  So far I'm out the cost of the CD, postage, and postage and packaging to return it.    I normally am pleased buying used CD's and DVD's from Amazon, but not this time!
B001JV5BIA|1.0|Don't waste your time with this, be warned. It's so unrealistic that you'll find yourself muttering 'give me a break' every 10 minutes. The whole thing is very poorly written right up to the absurd ending. <spoiler> I couldn't take any more when towards the end the father winds up fighting the girl, that's the girl, and somehow not only gets overpowered but folds over like a potato chip until mommy bursts in to the save the day! One has to wonder if there's something in the water that's causing brain death in Hollywood writers, producers and directors.
B00003JRCQ|5.0|Wondeful movie! It's very sweet and romantic, and probably one of the best of Jane Austen's stories. It's about a woman who is doomed to be an old maid because others have persuaded her to make certain decisions. Later in life, she begins to stand up for herself and chooses to make the right decision and is not persuaded by others! Just a great chic flic!
B001TOD9VI|4.0|I really like this movie Mickey Rourke and Marisa Tomei give impressive performances. They both play characters that are down hill for what they use to be. Marisa is a stripper in her late 30's (she looks great though) Mickey Rourke play a wash out almost forgotten Wrestler.<br /><br />This movie is about the life of an old retired Wrestler trying make a living and fit in. But it could be about anything else since the real story is about the life of the two main characters and how they deal with their lifes in a society that worship success, fame, beauty, and youth.  They try to recover past glories feel desire and maybe fall in love.
B0026ZNL7Q|5.0|This is one of my favorite Prog bands in the last 5 years..I have every album and this one is no different, great Melodies, riffs, bass lines, keyboards, and production is amazing. Take TOOL mix with Dream Theater and some old school prog rock and you have Riverside. If you enjoyed the other albums then this is a \\"Must have\\". The musician are superb :<br /><br />  * Mariusz Duda - lead vocals, bass guitar, acoustic guitar<br />  * Piotr Grudzi'ski - guitars<br />  * Piotr Kozieradzki - drums<br />  * Micha' 'apaj - keyboards, backing vocals<br />Here's a quote from Mariusz Duda:<br />\\"We have gone from Warsaw, we have changed the studio and the producer. We care deeply about creating a coherent record and that is why most probably there are only going to be 5 songs on it. The material will be energetic, multifarious, and - I hope so - very good for live performances. It will be a story about liquid modernity, life in a constant hurry, stress and anxiety about the future. A picture of our times in 1920 x 1080 definition.\\"<br /><br />Enjoy...
B001FB55H6|1.0|Let me start by saying that I'm not a comic book fan. I didn't even know the Watchmen exist before I went see this movie. So excuse me if I offend any of the hardcore fans.<br /><br />To me this movie is good and bad at the same time. The actions scenes are just superb... but those are too few and too far apart to make this movie good. For me 2:40 minutes siting in the theater is too long unless you care to provide a really interesting movie. I got so bored between the action scenes that almost leave the theater. They should just cut this movie to be 1:30 minutes tops... and then release the 2:40 minute extended version for the fans or make it a two part movie.
B00004I9VE|5.0|Delivery of the SACD was beyond belief, so fast. The quality of SACD is brilliant.
B001GCUNYO|5.0|Ok first lets be honest....  Liam Neeson is a middle age man so is not likely that in real life his capable of obliterating dozens of heavily arm dangerous human traffickers. But if you put that aside and remember that this is \\"just a movie\\" I'm sure you will enjoy this one.<br /><br />This is the type of action movie that will keep you at the edge of your sit. The story is good and solid, acting is really good (of course with Liam Neeson and Famke Janssen that's a given)<br /><br />Liam Neeson is the father of a 17YO girl kidnapped by human traffickers in Paris. Every parent worst fear right? of course... but this parent is not talking to the police or the media.... His going to Paris to get his daughter back no matter the cost (his not worried about being politically correct or anything like that). In the process he may kill a couple dozens human traffickers and uncover police corruption but hey.... that's what your looking for when you mess with the daughter of a retired C.I.A. agent. I really enjoy this movie and if your looking for a great action thriller this is the one.
B000JSI7C6|3.0|The movie was pretty good. Graphics were very good. Authenticity was also good. However, it took a long time for the movie to get to me. It was almost three weeks from the time that I ordered it until the time it arrived at my door.
B001GCUO16|5.0|Non of the X-men movies should be taking too seriously that said.... this is an awesome movie lots of action and by far the most interesting story of any of the X-men. Sure this is not King Lear but is not suppose to be either. I don't get other reviewers when they talk about the story being too thin. I say to those people come on!!! as long as they jam pack the movie with action scenes epic battles and portrait the characters accurately who cares if the story is not as complex as you would like it to be. They did make a great action movie... you just need to watch it as if you were a kid and enjoy a good old action flick.<br /><br />I like this movie so much that after watching it I went online and purchase the video game for Xbox360 and it was just as awesome XD<br /><br />PD: I hate Will.i.am acting in this movie (I like his music though)
B000JJS8TM|4.0|YIKES. Listening to Love in 5.1 is quite an audio experience unlike anything else. I'm not a \\"hardcore\\" Beatles-fan, but this (along with other projects) has really sparked an interest, and I'm beginning to see what was there back when our parents first enjoyed the band. The whole experience is a seamless \\"best of\\"-journey with razor sharp sound and some really clever editing. I'm glad they stuck mostly to the \\"old\\" Beatles, as the earlier \\"boy band\\"-stuff wouldn't sound as good nor fit along as captivatingly as this. My overall favourite moment is when the rather mundane \\"..Mr. Kite!\\" segues into an incredibly strong and rocking medley of \\"I Want You (She's So Heavy)\\" and \\"Helter Skelter\\", the screams echoing across the channels, the riffs roaring. But there are other highlights here as well, songs like \\"Hey Jude\\", \\"Because\\", and a clever combination of \\"Blackbird\\" and \\"Yesterday\\" sound pretty stunning. If you're ever to drop a tear, it's here.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong - the album itself sounds great (and sharper than any old mono LPs), but if you have the chance (and a good surround-system), pop the DVD Audio into your DVD player, select DTS, and experience The Beatles like never before. It's only a shame that the lyrics aren't presented on-screen (seems like a no-brainer), and that more artists of all sorts haven't come to embrace the much underrated DVD Audio format!
B001FB55HG|3.0|Terminator: Salvation follows `X-Men Origins: Wolverine' as one of the most pointless sequels/prequels of 2009.  It is better than Wolverine, but the film still is full of plot holes and a lack of lining up with any of the previous films.  There are good things in this movie, but there are also some bad things, and there is one thing that made me want to rip someone's head off.<br /><br />The Good<br />1. The Marcus character is interesting<br /><br />2. Fresh out from Star Trek Anton Yelchin continues to prove an extraordinary ability mimicking characters to perfection.<br /><br />3. A CGI body double of Arnold in his prime is very well-done.<br /><br />4.  A solid effort is put into the film's special effects.  They are the real reason this film is worth seeing at all, so Christian Bale should shut up, because I applaud the FX and lightning crew for this film more so than the director and the actors.<br /><br />The Bad<br />1. Christian Bale seems to think he's playing Batman in a Mad Max setting.<br /><br />2. Action scenes are so far over the top that many lose any form of believability- even if your brain is turned off<br /><br />3. A lack of clever dialogue.  Even Terminator 3 (another cheesy, bad film) had some good lines and moments.<br />4. Clich&eacute; laden script.<br /><br />5. Too many references to the previous film ruin an experience.  It's just hard to take a film seriously when the actors keep on winking to the audience.<br /><br />6. Lack of continuity is a big pain for veteran Terminator fans.  In this movie terminators are suddenly able to be taken down by machine gunfire (yes, I know these are \\"pre T-800 models,\\" but still...) and when the T-800 finally enters it survives a molten steel bath (doesn't that equal death according to the previous films?)<br /><br />The Ugly<br /><br />1. The film ends with the cheesiest quote I have ever heard in a big-budget action movie.  I won't spoil it, but when you hear Christian Bale's final quote you will want to slam your head into the nearest wood surface until you bleed.<br /><br />For Terminator fans the film is worth seeing at least one-time, either in theater, or via rental, but I wouldn't want to own this film.  Sure, I may rent it just to watch it again if I'm in the mood for a Terminator marathon, but I don't think it's worth the price, or space to own.  The film tries to be dark and gritty, but it comes across as being just a camp filled as Terminator 3, and the Mad Max inspired settings in no way reflect the dark future presented in the James Cameron flash backs.  Even the clips in Terminator 3 were far more accurate to the future James Cameron imagined.minator fans the film is worth seeing at least one-time, either in theater, or via rental, but I wouldn't want to own this film.

B001M5UDGS|2.0|Edit: 08-24-09: The following will be a \\"real\\" critique of Dr. Horrible. After going over the various comments that were left on this and realizing the error that I have made, it is time actually put up a review. The entire piece lasts roughly 42 minutes, broken down into 3 parts. On its surface, Dr. Horrible could be comparable to a superhero version of Wile E. Coyote and the Road Runner; Dr. Horrible being the Coyote and Captain Hammer the road runner. This parallel exists mainly in Dr. Horrible's constant attempts to create evil plans and Captain Hammer foiling them. As I said, this comparison only exists on the surface, for as we look deeper into the piece we realize that \\"Dr. Horrible\\" is really an analysis of the \\"average man\\" (beta male) competing against the alpha male. Most viewers can relate to this constant struggle to be recognized and understood for their talents.<br /><br />In my opinion, to fully grasp the complexity of \\"Dr. Horrible\\" one would have to watch the various shows the actors have been in; i.e. How I Met Your Mother, Firefly and The Guild. With those characters in mind, it is fascinating watching how they interact in the world of \\"Dr. Horrible,\\" sometimes the very opposite of the characters they had previously played. Watching Neil Patrick Harris play Barney in How I Met Your Mother, caused me to go into \\"Dr. Horrible\\" with an existing frame of reference, that was ultimately shattered; this made the viewing experience that more interesting. Nathan Fillon plays an over-exaggerated form of Cpt. Malcolm Reynolds and Felicia Day sheds her gamer side to play a character who likes to save the world in her own way.<br /><br />The success of these characters is result of a strong script and a great relationship between the actors. As I stated in my title, the concept is quite bland, but the strength of this piece was the of the characters and their interactions.<br /><br />I would definitely recommend \\"Dr. Horrible\\" and if I could change my ratingit would be to a 4.<br /><br />Dave.<br /><br />Ps. I have left the previous \\"review\\" so as to see what I had done and why I re-did my critique. To those that commented I thank you.<br /><br />Edit: 08-22-09 : Although I still stand by my questioning of why we should pay for this when it is free on the internet, it was brought to my attention (or rather I was reminded of what the writers had gone through) the fact that the studios were involved in bilking Mr. Whedon out of monies. I guess the anger that I have, is that he is not the only one hurting, as we are currently in a recession. Like I said in my review, Dr. Horrible is a brilliant piece of comedy that used the power of the internet to make it a success. To package it into something like a dvd, takes away from the original intent.<br /><br />This rating is in regards to the dvd, not the show. I loved Dr. Horrible and thought that Neil Patrick Harris did a great job portraying this bumbling super-villian. However, there is another supervillian: Joss Whedon and Hollywood. How can they make the consumers pay money for something that was created for the internet and was provided on the internet for free. I understand the need to make money to support other projects, but to blatantly take advantage of the consumer is wrong. In fact, it is abusive.<br /><br />I give it at least 2 stars, because the premise of the show was brilliantly executed. In fact, it is one of my favorite Whedon productions. The constant bickering between Dr. Horrible and Captain Hammer for the love of Penny was crisp and very ingenious. Due to this, I have seen Dr. Horrible numerous times. But I refuse to be pulled down and directly abused by the corporations who want to force the consumer to pay; in my case I am just a unemployed college student.<br /><br />Just remember I like the show, but dislike the abuse of Hollywood.<br /><br />Dave.
B001KVZ6FW|5.0|Up is a great film and defiantly ranks as one of Pixar's best- as well as one of the best animated films of the last ten years.  The only films that can compare are Pixar's Wall-E and The Incredibles.  The film is just a pure delight and one of the most mature films to come from the company that is without a doubt the most consistently entertaining studio in all of Hollywood.  It was easily the most mature, well thought out film I viewed during the 2009 Summer Movie Season, and I'm sure it will be considered one of the best films of the year.<br /><br />Story:  The story is one that has the light-hearted fantasy feel of a children's movie, while at the same time retaining the dark elements of an adult tale of obsession and greed.  Its plot is a very complex analysis about the passion of love, loss, and obsession and I was fascinated every-single second.  But, I should warn parents, behind the cute old man and the flying house this is ranks up with The Incredibles as one of the darkest films to receive the PG rating within the states.<br /><br />The story is about an old man who, after the death of his wife, lives a lonely, uneventful wife.  After assaulting a construction worker he is deemed a threat to the community and is told that he shall be removed from his home and forced into a retirement community.  With little choice he chooses to fulfill the dream that him and his spouse shared of placing their home near Paradise Falls in South America.<br /><br />Using thousands of helium filled balloons he begins this expedition, but along the way he is joined by many unexpected companions, ranging from a determined scout, a talking dog, and a large exotic bird.  In the end he is forced to decide what matters most in life.<br /><br />The film is modeled after the serials of the 1930s-1950s and carries along that fun, adventurous spirit throughout.<br /><br />Animation:  It's Pixar, what do you expect?  As usual it is top of the line and obviously had long hours of emotional effort put into it.  The animators for Pixar never seem fed-up with their jobs and always deliver the best.<br /><br />Voices:  Voice-acting is also top of the line.  Every voice actor is clearly treating the role seriously and having a fun time doing it.<br /><br />I highly recommend Up to children and adults- heck, I would recommend the movie to an adult, regardless of whether or not they had children.  It's just that good of a movie that it transcends age groups to be the most widely appealing film of the summer.<br /><br />Up emotionally compelling and full of fun with endless imagination.  It certainly deserves a rental and a space in your home movie collection to enjoy again and again.animators for Pixar never seem fed-up with their jobs and always deliver the best.

0307266303|2.0|Recently, while promoting this book, Christopher McDougall claimed that the Tarahumara people of Mexico have:<br /><br />  * no crime<br />  * no cholesterol (unlike all other animals)<br />  * no warfare<br />  * no heart disease<br />  * no clinical depression<br />  * no cancer<br />  * and have been known to run 435 miles in one go<br /><br />You can judge for yourself if those claims are credible.  Personally, I think everything McDougall says or writes should be taken with a grain of salt.<br /><br />Obviously, McDougall is right that humans did not evolve to run in sneakers. And I'm personally really interested in the more natural style of running that he's promoting.  Just be aware that Christopher McDougall exaggerates the truth to such a degree that \\"Born to Run\\" is essentially fiction.
B001GCUO1Q|2.0|X-Men Origins: Wolverine is a worthless entry in this popular movie series adapted from the classic Marvel superhero team.  In short:  The movie is a simple, soulless action movie that really doesn't give justice to its primary characters.  No character ever has a chance to develop a distinct personality, and we only understand Logan because of the fact that he has been a key player in three other films.<br /><br />Hugh Jackman is a wonderful, very promising actor who is somewhat typecast as Wolverine at this point -somewhat sad since he's had many better performances- but he never is really given a chance to display his acting talent a single time in this film.  This movie is a rock'em sock'em with no point to it other than the filmmakers wondering how many action scenes they can jam pack into its short running time.<br /><br />The point of the film seemed to be someone asking \\"How many mutants can we stuff into a single X-Men movie?\\" and then they just went from there.  Instead of actually giving us a chance to learn more about the character of Wolverine we end up with 90-minutes of pure action and zero in the way of character development.<br /><br />Now I know summer movies are supposed to be big, dumb fun, but when we had two great movies (X-Men, X2) building up this film's title character the result is his origin isn't nearly as interesting, or exciting as those films would have lead us to believe.<br /><br />The film is built on clich&eacute;s and has no interesting characters.  I would recommend skipping this film if you want to preserve the mystery of the Wolverine character you were given in the first films, because this \\"Origin Story\\" is bound to seriously disappoint you.  And even if you're seeking a mindless action movie I would recommend renting this movie because it is not worth anything more than five-dollars.

B0021L8US0|3.0|I viewed this movie alone in an audience of 95% male. I chose not to read reviews before going so I did not know what to expect. The movie right from the start belts you in the face with a political premise. As stated before, there are a lot of questions to be asked about the nature of the film.  Aliens getting stranded here, possible, but not probable.  Since humans have not made it to other planets, it would seem the more intelligent species would have a way to extradite themselves from our society with their superior weaponry, intelligence, and viable resources to achieve these goals.  Instead, they choose to subjugate themselves to the human race by living as illegal aliens fighting over cat food.      Come On Really???      I have an aversion to gore as most females do but even the men in the audience gushed a few yucks, I covered my eyes over most of the gore, so as not to lose my popcorn, as food was often done in the movie.  As stated there were no likeable characters in the movie except Christopher which Enemy Mine comes into thought. The main character was a jerk until a little bit of moral heroism at the end only came into factor when he realized his options of retaining human qualities were shortlived. His wife was a total bimbo so they were equally yoked.  I ended up rooting for the aliens (I often do) especially in getting rid of the pesky mercenary that would not stay down (excuse the pun) until he was eaten.  Christopher promised 3 years-to return - is that when we are to expect the sequel.  Don't get me wrong guys - I stayed with the movie all the way through but do all aliens have to be ooey gooey insects.   Final take, I thought it was ok but it saddened me to see such inhumanity displayed, because I know it was all too real. Atrocities have been implemented all throughtout history regardless of the color of ones skin, religous beliefs etc etc.  so those who are stating prejudice need to study history (accurately) not CNN, ABC, CBS, NBC tripe. Thesad thing is we never come up with a solution to stop it - not even in the movies where the writer,producer,director, has the power to create just that- a solution. Long story short - just take it as it is and watch - when it is over -  go see another.
B001XJEKGC|5.0|I recommned this to ANYONE who is a fan of either Steve or Eric. The DVD is just amazing. Both these guys were having a blast and the music shows it well.<br /><br />I won't bore anyone with the technical stuff as I always hate to read it in these reviews. Just know that if you like either one of these guys....GET THE DVD!!!!
B000059TEQ|5.0|Beautiful movie that takes you back in time.  Outstanding performances by the two leads bolstered by a strong script with very sharp dialog and banter.  The movie had an excellent pace and length and wasn't mawkish for one second.  Most incredibly, it made sense of the phrase \\"love is never having to say you're sorry\\".   Big thumbs up!
B000RUYQ2Q|5.0|The album arrived promptly and in excellent quality. I was very impressed with the seller. I would definitely purchase from them in the future.
B001GKYBXA|4.0|I haven't bought any ex-Beatles music in a long long time, except for George's last one. But this one by Paul is a pleasant surprise. Maybe that's sort of a backhanded compliment, but none of the Beatles alone are at anything like the level they were at as a group (as everyone must know). However, I really like \\"Sing The Changes\\". That one song alone makes the cd worth buying. There's something infectious (in a good way) about the song. It is exuberant, and the background vocals add so much to Paul's voice, which resonates and soars above the music. Exciting stuff!
B0020MKTOS|5.0|Product was received in good time and in perfect condition.  What else could you ask for?

B0002JJBZY|5.0|I believe this product to be one of my best investments.  I only recently became a Star Trek fan after seeing Star Trek XI and at the request of a friend, I rented Seasons 2 and 3.  I instantly loved it.  I bought all three seasons and haven't regretted it.  All three seasons still have the grainy imaging, which I think makes it authentic.  Plus, you can't beat the acting. :)  I recommend this product to anyone looking for any kind of entertainment.  Even though it is a science-fiction show, it still has humor, love, etc.

067144901X|5.0|My son, now 17 months, got this in a book exchange just before his first birthday.  He enjoyed hearing the story then and liked the pictures, but now he likes to participate.  He says, \\"moo\\" and \\"baa\\" at the appropriate moments and when we get to the singing pigs (Seinfeld fans, if you recall a certain episode, then you know exactly how we read/sing it in my house) he wags his finger and says, \\"No No No.\\"  He always has something different to say at the end. It's very fun and I love that it attaches a silly meaning to the word, \\"NO\\" so it doesn't just mean he's doing something he shouldn't (although he didn't lose the original meaning, either).  He's learning to associate it with errors as well.
B000B7QCKE|3.0|I recently bought the CD because I have the tape of this show and love it and wanted to have the music to play in the car on trips.  I was disappointed in the CD because it has more songs I was not familiar with and not all the songs that I loved from the live performance.
015603283X|5.0|This is a new wrinkle in mystery stories.  How could he miss?    Arturo Perez-Reverte mixes two sure-fire ingredients: \\"The Three Musketeers\\", which is one of the most popular adventure and action series around the world even today, plus the mysteries of devil-worship and the occult.    Then he adds a third ingredient. Our flawed \\"hero\\" is a book detective. Lucas Corso moves in the shadow world of rare and precious volumes of antiquity almost beyond price.  The result is an intriguing read that will keep you guessing and entertain you with new knowledge. The book world is much more passionate and violent than we may imagine.    Moviegoers may have seen the film version, still available on video: \\"The Nine Gates\\" with current swish-buckling pirate captain Johnny Depp in the lead role. In the cinema, Depp is Corso and far more serious than his laughable Captain Jack Sparrow today.   The film version simplified the story to focus on a single drama. But it lost the confusing threads so delightful in the book.    Nothing is lost in translation from the Spanish by Sonia Soto, as far as I can see. \\"The Club Dumas\\" celebrates the Three Musketeers stories by Alexandre Dumas. It starts with a hand-written manuscript by the original author. Possession of this manuscript is closely tied with a suicide that opens the book. Or is it murder?   But that is not Corso's concern. He is paid not only to authenticate and sell the manuscript, but find another rare literary occult masterpiece, \\"The Nine Gates\\". Only three copies exist. Which is authentic?    Avid readers and admirers of books will enjoy this mystery adventure.   Perez-Reverte may be better known for his Captain Alatriste series. \\"The Fencing Masters,\\" \\"The Flanders Panel,\\" and \\"The Seville Companion\\" are other examples of his work. This one is more intriguing to me.

B0015DWLD0|2.0|DrEwgog (Croton on Hudson, NY)  I picked it for a quick read and it fit the bill so I`m not complaining.  The setting was new to me and interresting for the most part.  The central character is not new but he was drawn adequately.  The treatment was inconsistent at times, but not so often that it proved distracting.  Keener editing would have ironed this out.    I look forward to AA`s next book, but I have to say that my final impression is one of sadness not for A`s adept depiction of bankruptcy, but for the value he places on it.
B001OQCV2Y|5.0|Quentin Tarantino has taken his anti-Nazi fantasy to new heights with this engrossing dark comedy/fantasy that has \\"The Basterds\\" (led by BRAD PITT) out for Nazi scalps to add to an ever growing collection. But first and foremost, he has constructed a screenplay that never lets up veering between tension and laughter, and gives several members of his cast a chance at Oscar-winning performances.<br /><br />Foremost among these is CHRISTOPH WALTZ who waltzes off with all of his scenes by playing the \\"Jew Hunter\\" with subtle bits of characterization that remind me of a young Conrad Veidt at the height of his powers. He never misses an opportunity to give greater depth to his character's personality quirks and sudden changes of mood that always heighten the tension. The farmhouse scene that starts the story rolling is one of the greatest pieces of sustained suspense I've ever seen any director pull, even Hitchcock.<br /><br />My only quibble with the film, in fact, would be the extended bar scene in which a clever plot to trap some Nazi officers goes awry. The director could have tightened the whole sequence with a cut of some ten or more minutes.<br /><br />But who's going to voice complaints when the film is fiendishly clever from start to finish, and so well executed that you leave the theater after being spellbound for the duration of the lengthy story. All of the performances surrounding BRAD PITT and CHRISTOPH WALTZ are pitch perfect and Pitt himself is mighty amusing as the Southern lieutenant who likes to cut Swastikas into the skulls of his German foes.<br /><br />DENIS MENOCHET is superb as the farmer in the film's opening scene, matching the convincing performance of CHRISTOPH WALTZ every step of the way. Not enough praise can be said for the performances Tarantino has gotten from his entire cast and that includes MELANIE LAURENT who has a key role as the only woman who manages to escape the massacre that opens the film. Her interaction with a German officer (DANIEL BRUHL) who is attracted by her is a fascinating one, especially since she has no intention of succumbing to his courteous flirtations.<br /><br />This is definitely putting Tarantino's best foot forward--and if it doesn't end up with several Oscar nominations in both acting and technical categories, I'll be very surprised.<br /><br />Just brilliant.by her is a fascinating one, especially since she has no intention of succumbing to his courteous flirtations.

140120841X|5.0|Being a huge fan of the film adaptation, I felt more than obligated to pick up the work the film is based on. If the film was a boom, the graphic novel is a crescendo. The novel depicts an even more abhorrent government and a much more politically indoctrinated V. Moore brilliantly creates a post-apocalyptic world of opposing ideals and turmoil. The ardent anarchist that is V dosent just represent a one man mission of revenge but a true vision to create the \\"land of do-as-you please.\\"  I can say with out a doubt Alan Moore and David Lloyd have  made a true masterpiece that serves not just as entertainment but doubles as a stark warning to the thereat expanding government power in the name of security. Simply brilliant!
0446364495|4.0|The Bridges of Madison County is certainly not the most well written book of our time, and there are more than a few cliches, but the love story is strong. I tend to pull this book out about once a year when I just need a good, simple love story. It takes just a couple of hours to read the book straight through, and it's worth the time.    Francesca and Robert have a life-changing week together, when her husband and children are away. At the end of the week, she must decide whether to stay in her routine, predictable, life that is lacking in passion or run away with the hippie photographer. Whichever decision she makes will lay plan for the rest of her life, and both have painful consequences.    This book reminds me of the power love has over each of us, and what we can and can't live without. It reminds me of promises made, and how we all rank our priorities differently but that doesn't necessarily make us right or wrong.
B001993Y2C|5.0|One of the most anticipated boxsets is here, for the best series of the last decade and one of the best ever. It's a lifetime experience to watch this show in HD, while the packaging is almost stunning. I don't get the complains about that, it is indeed big, but it's very impressive while the Centurion replica is very nice and detailed. The contents of the Bluray version are great, although Face of The Enemy webisodes and the Special Episodes should have been included. All in all, highly recommeneded!

0679420266|4.0|\\"The Stranger\\" may be hailed as an existentialist classic, but its author rejected that label. Albert Camus wasn't one for joining any club, whether or not they'd have him as a member. In \\"The Stranger\\", he celebrates, insofar as the novel can be said to celebrate anything, being an outsider.<br /><br />Meursault lives a life of complete detachment, a fact brought home when his mother dies. He feels nothing but a vague obligation to be present for her funeral. His girlfriend wants to marry, but he just shrugs disinterested agreement. His boss offers a promotion, including relocation from Algiers to Paris, and it's like six of one versus a half dozen of the other.<br /><br />This might seem a rather poor way to live, but when Meursault finally takes decisive action, it results in a death sentence. The situation gives him the perspective to realize that his path has been right; and his ultimate fate is a matter of cosmic indifference.<br /><br />\\"I could see that it makes little difference whether one dies at thirty or threescore and ten - since, in either case, other men and women will continue living, the world will go on as before,\\" he thinks.<br /><br />Like the old saying goes, in the long run we'll all be dead anyway. It's hard to tell whether Camus is simply presenting this mindset as unavoidable truth, or sending it up in some subtle way. Certainly the concept of hero as pimp-befriending sociopath makes one wonder whether this is supposed to be read as straightforwardly as written. Whatever Camus's motivation for this, his first novel, published in 1942, \\"The Stranger\\" presents a gripping narrative of total alienation, one of tremendous sadness and a bit of humor. A drawn-out finale feels more like a philosophy essay than fiction, but Camus's presentation of the thinking of a condemned person (use a little imagination and it can be any of us) sticks in your guts.<br /><br />The first half of the book is for me the richest part. Meursault's life in his shabby apartment, all but one small part of it unused, is almost comic in its bleakness, and thus endurable in a way the second, unrelievedly bleaker half, is not. Meursault stands on his porch for an entire day, smoking cigarettes, eating chocolate, waving to a passing parade of soccer players, and watching the cats run along the street as day turns to night. One neighbor has a dog he beats, but cries over when it escapes. Another, the pimp he befriends, wants Meursault to agree with his woman-beating strategies. Meursault shrugs, offering enough assent to keep the guy satisfied.<br /><br />What one makes of Meursault's only volitional action, the one that ends Part One, is the novel's great mystery. Insofar as I cared (and it's hard to when the protagonist clearly doesn't), it may well be the price of Meursault's temporary socialization. Make friends with criminals and become one yourself. Yet that seems too moralistic a message for Camus. Perhaps for him, it's the fact he socializes with anyone that puts him so at fault. Or maybe he's not at fault, because the sun was hot and nothing really matters anyway.<br /><br />Those who pick up a book wanting a concrete story and a definitive resolution won't be happy with \\"The Stranger\\". It's not a story as much as it is a philosophical construction, defining the nature of existence in its bleakest form. To a large extent, it succeeds, because the character of Meursault and his surroundings are related so pungently in Camus's singularly detached prose.nused, is almost comic in its bleakness, and thus endurable in a way the second, unrelievedly bleaker half, is not.

B00009W0WM|5.0|\\"The lure of 'Casablanca' lies in its romance, intrigue and mystery. But those are common ingredients for many movies. What makes it a landmark film and a touchstone for so many is largely because of its romance....It's no wonder 'Casablanca' remains a favorite of audiences around the world.\\" ~ Narrative by Lauren Bacall ~<br /><br />Stephen Bogart, son of Humphrey Bogart, described \\"Casablanca\\" as \\"one of those timeless beauties that last forever.\\" He is absolutely right about it--his words mirror some of my thoughts about this classic of a film. After sixty-seven years, the 1943 Academy Awards \\"Best Picture\\" is still attracting myriads of viewers, young and old alike. Michael Curtiz did an excellent directorial job that ultimately earned him the \\"Best Director\\" award while brothers Julius and Philip Epstein, and Howard Koch won the \\"Best Screenplay.\\" Even though Bogart did not win the \\"Best Actor\\" in which he was nominated for, I admire his acting. I believe he was one of the most credible actors of all-time who can do justice to any role that he portrayed. He was such a great actor with intriguing yet magnetic personality. Paul Henreid's role as Victor Laszlo, a Resistance leader, was also remarkably depicted. I admire his character that shows his patriotism and not to mention his kind understanding and undying love for his wife albeit her infidelity.<br /><br />Although I've seen the film several times in the past, I still enjoy it from start to finish whenever I feel like watching it again--just like I did two nights ago before turning in to bed. I still feel the very same emotions with each viewing. (This Two-Disc Special Edition is my second purchase of \\"Casablanca\\" DVDs, the first one was One-Disc Edition--ASIN 6305736650).<br /><br />While the storyline is not exactly the best love story ever written because of its unexpected twist in the ending, it is absolutely one of the best films ever produced and one of my top five favorite classic films of all-time. The portrayal of the main characters, Rick and Ilsa, are impressively acted out to perfection--the dashing debonair Humphrey Bogart as Rick Blaine, a caf&eacute; owner who \\"sticks his neck out for nobody\\" but is willing to kill if someone crosses him; and the stunningly beautiful Ingrid Bergman as Ilsa Lund, a once-lonely-wife who cheated on her husband in Paris while the latter was at the concentration camp. Theirs is a one-of-a-kind, poignant love story. She is very much married and yet she fell madly in love and had an affair with another man who told her on the second time they parted, \\"We'll always have Paris.\\"<br /><br />Many years passed after they were separated from each other, both were surprised when they crossed paths again only to discover that they still have strong feelings for each other. That chance meeting rekindled the smoldering embers that never die in their hearts. \\"They have a date with fate in Casablanca.\\" Even though Ilsa broke Rick's heart, he loved her so much that he once described her, \\"She isn't just any woman.\\" And that feeling was mutual and was very much reciprocated by Ilsa.<br /><br />Ilsa: \\"I don't know what's right any longer. You have to think for both of us, for all of us.\\"<br />Rick: \\"All right, I will. Here's looking at you, kid.\\"<br />Ilsa: \\"I wish I didn't love you so much.\\"<br /><br />Another thing that made \\"Casablanca\\" appealing is the beautiful soundtrack courtesy of Max Steiner who wrote the music score. He was described as \\"the favorite composer of Warner Brothers and was famous for writing stunning scores, he's always on the cutting edge for all his scores.\\" He was also nominated for \\"Best Musical Scoring.\\" He should have won the award, his choice of music is impeccable--all the greatest songs from 1930s and early 1940s. Henry Mancini, an outstanding composer/film scorer/arranger/conductor, once said that \\"As Time Goes By\\" is \\"masterful and it is tied to the film so tightly.\\" That is so true, no one thinks of \\"Casablanca\\" without a reference to Herman Hupfeld's \\"As Time Goes By.\\" The movie and the song are like \\"Romeo and Juliet\\" or \\"Nicholas and Alexandra\\" or \\"Dunn and Bradstreet\\" or even \\"Ben and Jerry's.\\"<br /><br />Remember the following memorable scenes? These are the scenes that moved me the most, To me, they are the emotional highlights of the film. There is a sentimental and nostalgic touch in the way the song was rendered by Sam (Dooley Wilson).<br /><br />Ilsa: \\"Some of the old songs, Sam.\\"<br />Sam: \\"Yes, Ma'am.\\"<br />----------------------<br />Ilsa: \\"Play it once, Sam, for old time's sake.\\"<br />Sam: \\"I don't know what you mean, Ms. Ilsa.\\"<br />Ilsa: \\"Play it, Sam.

(starts humming)<br />(Sam starts playing)<br />Ilsa: \\"Sing it, Sam.\\"<br />Sam: (Singing)<br />\\"You must remember this<br />A kiss is just a kiss<br />A sigh is just a sigh<br />The fundamental things apply<br />As time goes by<br />And when two lovers woo<br />They still say 'I love you'<br />On that you can rely<br />No matter what the future brings<br />As time goes by\\"<br /><br />Then comes Rick with a stern face saying, \\"Sam, I thought I told you never to play it!\\"<br /><br />And later Ilsa told Rick, \\"Say goodnight to Sam for me. There's still nobody in the world who can play \\"As Time Goes By\\" like Sam. To which Rick replied, \\"He hasn't played it in a long time.\\"<br /><br />And much later that night while Rick was drinking alone, Sam came in. Rick asked him to join him for a drink but he did not oblige, instead he started playing the piano. There is that obvious pain and regret in Rick's face. Anyone who has loved and lost can feel for him and can empathize with him.<br /><br />Rick: \\"Sam!\\"<br />Sam: \\"Yes, boss?\\"<br />Rick: \\"It's December 1941 in Casablanca. What time is it in New York?<br />Sam: \\"Aah, my watch stopped.\\"<br />Rick: \\"I'd better sleep in New York. I'd better sleep all over America.

B002BFBAUG|5.0|The initial backlash from customers expecting an entirely different film will subside I believe, as long as people go into this expecting nothing of what was advertised. The trailers and ad promos campaign this as being a laugh-a-minute follow up to this cast and crew's other films, when actually it covers the twenty-something angst of finding one self (and love) while working in a less than stellar environment (with a few good laughs in the middle).<br /><br />The Blu picture looked good, and the DTS was great for the 80s music and funland/carnival style sounds. What gives this a higher rating is the amount of work put into the extras, even though some of them suck and are unfunny, it does not disqualify the time they put into these.<br />* Frigo's Taps (excl. to Blu) - the whack guy gets his few minutes to show how to master the tapping of a man's region, was actually funnier than the movie - be sure to watch until the end when the director gets him back - my favorite was the drive-by tap.<br />* Lisa Fashion Tips (excl. to Blu) - irritating, skip it.<br />* Welcome To Adventureland, Orientation and Drug Policy Videos (excl. to Blu) - close to what one saw if you watched Waiting. Some funny moments, but dry. They are all filmed with a retro feel and degraded film stock.<br /><br />On all versions:<br />* 3 minutes of deleted scenes, forgettable.<br />* Making of - lasts 17 minutes and has the standard fare on logistics, production and cast selection reasoning.<br />* Picture/Music option - allows you to go to the scene directly as sorted by the song being played.<br /><br />Once I saw what kind of film it was regarding themes and type of \\"comedy\\", I was alright with rating it higher. The ending was unrealistic, but kudos to the prop department for doing a solid job on recreation of the period. 3 1/2 for the film, 1 1/2 for the Blu pic, supplements and sound.

B00192KCQ0|2.0|Well like everyone else, I got into metal with these guys and bought every albumn that came out...until St. Anger. That was just an abomination. I still laughing thinking about how ANYONE can think that was a good sound. Just horrible. So we wait a while, and here comes Death MAgnetic. Another \\"return to form\\"...how cliche!     I didn't want to buy this CD. The sound production is god awful yet again...but once I kept hearing the Day that Never Comes...I thought this wasn't all bad. And then Cyanide...and then when All Nightmare Long blasted me off my chair, I caved and bought it. I have a rule - if 4 songs on a CD are great - I'll buy it. Basically 3 songs are good on this CD so far, BUT All nightmare long truly is a beast of music. It would fit right along side master of puppets.    Other than that, the songs often go on too long, and James voice, while I like it...isn't totally right for some of this music. I mean...singing on All nightmare long just doesn't work. He needs to go old school and bark like he used to...get some vile in his vocals!    All in all...this CD won't be played a lot...but when I need to get a fix from All Nightmare long and Day that never comes, I'll put it back in.    Not a bad effort...just lackluster and long winded. Plus the production is crappy. Ugh...non mainstream metal bands have a way better sound that this.
B001XRLWPQ|5.0|Short version: this is a great show - if you've never seen it, do yourself a favor and watch it! Long form: I've noticed that most of the \\"glowing\\" reviews for this ABC show have come from women - who are clearly quite infatuated with the male lead - but I'm sure there are lots of guys out there, who like me, also love the show...and who (also like me) haven't failed to notice the considerable charms of the female lead! (She had a brief part in the most recent James Bond film  - playing an agent who is being duped in the same way as Bond's girlfriend in the previous film.)  In any case, the two of them seem to have that genuine and increasingly rare screen chemistry that makes it fun watching their relationship grow; and Castle's daughter (an incredibly well-adjusted \\"normal\\" kid) and his mother, who live together with him, along with the two other homicide detectives, their captain, the female M.E., and assorted others, round out a great cast. Castle's fame and wealth have allowed him to be something of a lothario; however since meeting Beckett, apparently a reformed one - so now he's just your basic adult Peter Pan with a knack for knocking out hugely popular mystery novels, and yet still a caring, involved dad - who is able to afford great toys, by the way. Beckett is a slightly repressed (with good reason, we've learned) yet sexy and incredibly focused detective, and don't ask me how, but the two balance each other out perfectly. Anyway, rent or buy the first season if you missed it, and get ready for the upcoming (I hope) second season...when we left them last summer, Castle was just about to risk forever alienating Beckett, by telling her some critical information about her mother's death, a subject she'd warned him to avoid under threat of ending their budding friendship, but that he feels she has to hear to ever have closure...so stay tuned!
0374250324|5.0|From the first lines of this book, I was hooked. Tom Wolfe has such an easy way of bringing to life such an amazing time in American history. I have always considered the Mercury-Apollo missions the pinnacle of American space flight. Plus, as a child at the tail-end of the cold war, I grew up with a natural distrust of the Russians. The Right Stuff blends the history of the beginnings of the Mercury program while combining a healthy dose of patriotism; and it does all this in with such a conversational tone that I almost felt that I was listening to stories from my grandpa. Lately this has been the non-fiction book that I recommend to most and I don't hesitate recommending it to anyone. Don't miss this one.

B000268QB2|5.0|Anyone who spends any time with me knows that tho I'm a bit of a music snob (mouths shut), I also have pretty eclectic taste. I was also one of the few New Yorkers to shun the whole lo-fi garage rock thing. My feeling is, pop and rock music should include, oh I dont know...melody. There was some weird taking-pride-in-lack-of-songwriting-skill that I hate, that being the main reason I can't stand Punk music. So when bands like Coldplay (for which even mentioning that they are always compared to has become ubiquitous) and Travis began worrming their way back into the mainsteam, no one was happier than I to have the melody return to pop music.<br /><br />And then I heard the Keane record.<br /><br />Keane are a three piece band consisting of bass, drums and piano. The lack of a lead guitar gives the group a more restrained sound less inclined to veer off toward the power chord moments.<br /><br />The first three songs solidly land \\"Hopes And Fears\\" amongst the most cherished of albums in the realm of music. Solid hooks, soaring choruses, lyrics both simple and heartfelt and production worthy of the songwriting. \\"Somewhere Only We Know\\" begins with a hook that would only make any sense on keyboards (check The Killers \\"Indie Rock `n' Roll\\" for a similar riff that comes off a lot harsher on guitar) and continues through a chorus that will be in your head for days.<br /><br />The next track, \\"This is the Last Time\\" is one of those soaring songs that you just want to crank up and spin and sing along to at maximum volume. In serious contention, it uses its simple octave bassline and Tom Chaplin's amazing voice to churn up a slice of massive shimmering U2-meets-\\"Friday I'm In Love\\" that can only be described as majestic.<br /><br />And so it goes for 11 tracks, some ballads, some weaker than others, but overall this is one of the strongest records of quite some time.

B001FB4VZS|4.0|This season of Smallville really surprised me. I wasn't really crazy about the season premiere because they went the whole \\"Clark loses his powers\\" angle again, but after that the season really took off. Perhaps the biggest surprise, was how well they pulled off all of the doomsday stuff which I was really skeptical about. I know this season wasn't perfect (none of them are) but I mean for a comic geek this season was really a new starting point. They included the Legion of Superheroes, Introduced the Red Blue Blur Concept, and established just why the Smallville version of Jimmy Olsen was so much older than the comic version. I know people have their problems with the finale but ultimately that finale did more right than wrong, and to get mad simply because the fight was a little lacking is a being overly critical. Overall if you're a Smallville fan this season should definitely keep you entertained, it's the best season since season 5.

B001HN697M|3.0|The story line is very interesting and unique, but there is no happy ending to this movie.  All movies can't have a happy ending, but this is one that seems as though it should have.  There was an awesome lovestory line going on that I was sorry to see it end the way it did.  It kind of left me wanting more.
1847879071|5.0|Field's revision of his text, which may already be considered a classic, is outstanding and certainly the best of the SPSS-oriented texts.   He certainly has mastered the art of clearly presenting complex topics.  The book is an interesting read, although I personally find his frequent attempts at humor to sometimes be rather infantile and/or odd.  The presentation of MANOVA and its relation to discriminant analysis is excellent, but I wish that there had been a discussion of MANCOVA.  In spite of these caveats, highly recommended for advanced undergraduates and beginning graduate students.
B000006YMN|1.0|Listening to her, the cd name is appropriate.  She didn't have the sparkle projected when in the ABBA group.
B001FB4VZS|5.0|**Spoiler Alert**<br />Now i have to admit that i am a little young for the comic, however i am huge Lois & Clark fan (starring Dean Cain and Teri Hatcher). My mom and me would watch it every sunday and i have always loved superman since i was a kid. When Smallville started out i was beyond exstatic and my stepdad fills me in on how the show is or isn't like the comic. He on the other hand remembers the comic vividly and i like to hear just how on track they are based on the comics. I will admit i was a little sad about the season finale, but once i was told about how it was impossible for Jimmy to know Clark at that age was 21st century and not based off the comic. Sammie (another comic friend of mine) explained the comic version to me and it made since why they killed him off and also why they showed Chloe handing Jimmy's little brother his camera. I was proud of the Legion of Superhero's i am a little familiar with them and even more familiar with them now. I was even more happy about doomsday. Being able to see the doomsday event tells me that we are getting somewhere and the next seasons should better than ever. If you weren't happy with Smallville then maybe NOW is the time to come back, because they are doing big things and we are getting to see Clark Kent transform into Superman. LOVING EVERY MINUTE OF IT!!!<br /><br /> I also wanted to add about the Lois Lane disappearing act. I think that when Lois returns she will not remember Clark and will meet him for the first time (or second) at the Daily Planet. I bring this up, because this was really bugging another friend of mine who couldn't understand why they brought lois in this series so early. I think it was to introduce us to her and explain their sudden attraction. Of course i may be wrong, but that's what i think will happen.
B001FB4W0W|5.0|When I heard that they were making a show about the Sookie books, I was both thrilled & a little skeptical. What would they change? Who would they cast? Would they alter the plots around in order to make for better watching & would I like the changes? A few episodes down the line, I was hooked.<br /><br />If you haven't heard the plotline of True Blood then you have to have been hiding under a rock somewhere. In other words, I'm not going to bother going over the plotline here like I do in most of my other reviews. I'm just going to skip to what I thought.<br /><br />I love it! True, some of the characters have been changed (Tara is now far more involved than she was in the books & she's now related to Lafayette) but overall I can't help but like the changes, which is saying a lot for someone like me who is such a literary purist! The plotline has also been changed & extended a little. Some things that happened later in the book have been brought to the beginning of the series, but that's just for better plot flow.<br /><br />I adore the casting. I have to admit that I was skeptical of Anna Paquin as Sookie, but I like what she brings to the table. I also adore Lafayette- he's one of the best ones cast in the series. (I'm glad that they fleshed out his character more in the show- he was woefully underdone in the book series.)<br /><br />Over all, I really had nothing to complain about with this series. I honestly didn't expect to like it as much as I have, especially with how easily I can get bored with many tv shows.
B000NQRE0K|5.0|Highest possible recommendation to the one or two adults on the planet who may still not have seen the movie.

0671027344|1.0|The biggest problem I had with this book, and shockingly the most lauded aspect,  was Charlie. He was the most unrealistic protagonist I have ever seen. Fifteen year olds who aren't evangelical christians know what masturbation is. They don't use the word genitals in casual writing. They say \\"really\\" not \\"very\\" or \\"especially\\". They use contractions, not the precious and oh-so-earnest alternative. They'd never call it \\"marijuana\\" if they were also smoking it. And they never, ever, use the term \\"grown-ups\\" with a straight face. Or, here, let me clarify:    Fifteen year olds who take drugs, like the Smiths, know the meaning of the word \\"infinite,\\" drink in excess, have seen a rape, have had a friend commit suicide, and who have witnessed a whole number of other after school special scenarios, do not write this way. Autistic savants write this way, third graders write this way, and 25 year olds who want their characters to do their heartstring-tugging work for them, they too write this way.    When I was fifteen (only three years ago, by the way,) I will admit, I was like Charlie in a few ways. Socially awkward, smart, the prototypical \\"weird gifted and talented kid\\". I wanted so badly for him to be exactly like me, acerbic (or trying to be,) self-conscious to an absurd degree, wanting to be impressive, and eagerly clamoring for the \\"Prodigy\\" title. But somehow, Charlie manages to be brilliant (in fact, the most brilliant person one teacher has ever met! how sweet!) while being utterly clueless and guileless. His writing is mediocre, his intellectual grasp of the books he reads (and apparently writes stellar analyses of) is childlike, yet somehow he manages to spew out his profound observations on human nature in between descriptions of what Secret Santa is (embedded in quotes, as if he's talking to a foreign exchange student.) We are meant to believe that he is at once gimlet- and doe-eyed.     To be clear: Charlie is not a wallflower at all. When I think \\"wallflower,\\" I think socially anxious, awkward, paralyzed by nerves. Charlie is antisocial, in the clinical sense of the word. It's not that he is scared of social interaction, it's that he doesn't have the faintest idea how it works.    But the implausibility doesn't stop there: somehow, this socially-retarded young Plato manages to befriend and enchant a group of worldly-ultra cool seniors who, in their pretentious (but retrospectively lame) 90's rituals (Eating at Big Boy, drinking brandy and reading dark poetry together, publishing-I'm serious- ZINES,) represent all the real-life Charlies, the ones who are suburbanite-edgy and troubled and wise and, most realistically, desperately want you to think that they are. Unlike Charlie, they listen to the Smiths not so much because they feel \\"infinite\\" when they hear Morrissey's whiny ballads, but because they so badly want you to know how much they love cool music, cool movies, and cool people. In their spine-crushing attempts to be spine-crushingly cool, they are more accurate depictions of real teenagers than Charlie. This is not to say that they are realistic either, as their relatively unpretentious speech and open-arms acceptance of Charlie is difficult to swallow, but they are certainly more real than our hero Mary Sue Caulfield. My, how convenient for Chbosky that Charlie can be called upon to be edgy, volatile, brilliant, simple, clueless, and even a weeping head case who goes suddenly catatonic. It all depends on what works best with Chbosky's newest ready-for-my-MTV-closeup scene. Some might say that this rollercoaster of emotions adds to the realism, is a normal part of teenage life, but these people don't remember the shocking banality of teenhood.    Let's not forget the after school special feel of it all, something that, unlike my observations on Charlie's unrealistic preciousness, has been noted by many other reviewers. I will only echo what they say: Very few teenagers go from complete naivete to drugs, sex, androck 'n roll so quickly and so smoothly. I was reminded of horrible tripe like Go Ask Alice and Catherine Hardwicke's movie Thirteen, in which innocence is so quickly shattered and the lives of supposedly smart and responsible kids so easily and seamlessly muddied that we are left to wonder if the perpetrators of these fantastical coming-of-age lies have ever even been teenagers. But I digress...    And for the record, I am not averse to cute coming-of-age stories with a precious little smarty pants at their center. I loved Jonathan Safran Foer's Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close, and thought Oskar Schell was, if a bit unrealistic, at least charmingly so. I thought A Heartbreaking Work of Staggering Genius was quite good, mostly because it was so honest with itself, and I loved Mark Haddon's The Curious Incident of the Dog In the Nighttime. I might add that his protagonist actually WAS autistic, but somehow quite similar to Charlie in his bursts of uncharacteristic violence, simple speech, and utter lack of people skills. If you're looking for a better read than this one, I would suggest picking up one of those titles.    To be fair, there were some passages I liked. Occasionally I stopped my seething and identified with Charlie's passivity and mistaken idea that helping other lives along and watching still counts as living. And I did enjoy Sam's speech to him at the end about love and needing him to be there. But Charlie himself was too much, and his voice cast a heartbreakingly innocent, daisy-chained, Tiny Tim shadow over anything that could qualify as profound.    I think it's time to wrap up this little hatefest, so I'll end with some advice regarding who this book IS for, since it is certainly not for me.    If you loved Juno, if you enjoy twee pop, if you absolutely looooove mixtapes but weren't alive when people actually made them for each other, if you have Anne Geddes photographs in your home, if you're one of those people who constantly rambles on abouthow a song, or book, or movie \\"changed your life,\\" then this book, this saccharine sweet little cupcake of a book, is singularly, and unfortunately, made for you.
B000JBWWRY|5.0|I've always loved this movie!  So, as you may know, I couldn't help but purchase the 2-Disc Platinum Edition of Peter Pan as soon as I spotted it!  It's such a great little tale, and can teach about a dozen valuable lessons.  Also, it comes with all kinds of bonus features that are just as fun and dandy as the movie itself.  My family and I have many fond memories of watching Walt Disney's Peter Pan in our living room, and now we can continue them for a good long time!  Highly recommended for everyone at any age!!!
1400049628|5.0|A must have for anyone who loves zombies.  A mixture of common sense and comedy.  Feals so real and is taken so seriously you can't stop reading.  Just a funny book.  Well, in a sick kinda zombie way......
B000OPOAM0|5.0|One of the greatest of the small time movies that maximizes its budget and is truly exciting.  Of course, T2 is a better movie, but this one made \\"I'll be back\\" a catch phrase that was on everyone's lips at the time.
1601251505|5.0|Weighing in at nearly five pounds and spanning over 576 pages, the Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook combines all of the rules that were previously split between the D&D 3.5 Players Handbook and Dungeon Masters Guide. It is everything that you are going to need to play except for the Pathfinder Bestiary, which is not scheduled to be released until October 2009. Until then, you'll need to break out your old 3.5 edition monster manuals or use the monsters in the d20 SRD. You can download the SRD for free over at wizards.com, or for an easy to use online version, check out the Hypertext d20 SRD online at [...]<br /><br />* The Core Classes of Pathfinder *<br />Paizo put a lot of effort into spicing up all of the original 3.5e classes with new and exciting abilities. Many of the classes now have multiple paths that a player can follow to help make distinguish their character from the teeming masses of other adventurers of the same class. This is very reminiscent of what Fourth Edition did, and it is one of the things I really liked. You'll especially see this featured with the druid, cleric, paladin, ranger, rogue, sorcerer, and wizard classes.<br /><br />I was also impressed by how much the game rewards the player who sticks it out and levels his character through all twenty levels of his core class. In the past, there has often been very little incentive (or sense in some cases) to do so. With Pathfinder, not only does your character receive an extra hitpoint or skill-point every level just for leveling in his favored class, but the game does an excellent job of providing all kinds of cool abilities at the highest levels. Many of the classes have awesome payouts for making it all the way to twentieth, including:<br /><br />  - For Barbarians there is \\"Mighty Rage,\\" which gives them an impressive +8 morale bonus to Strength and Constitution while they are raging.<br />  - Bards are able to give a performance so stirring that they can cause their target to simply die from overwhelming joy or sorrow using their \\"Deadly Performance.\\"<br />  - High level druids are no longer fettered by their natural forms, and can transform themselves at will with no limits on the number of times per day.<br />  - Fighters gain \\"Weapon Mastery,\\" with one weapon. Thereafter, whenever using his chosen weapon, all critical threats are automatically confirmed, their critical multiplier increases, and the fighter no longer has to worry about being disarmed - ever.<br />  - The monk eventually ascends to the point of becoming a magical creature, gaining a healthy damage resistance (10/chaotic). Oh, and he'll now be opening that can of whoop-ass with seven attacks per round with an attack bonus that nearly rivals the fighter's.<br />  - Paladins who stay the course of righteousness become \\"Holy Champions\\" of their gods, gaining a substantial damage resistance and the ability to possibly banish any evil outsider who is his smite opponent. (By the way, if you haven't read about the paladin's new smite and mercy abilities already, you'll want to check them out. This is one of the classes that they really spent a lot of time on, and they have succeeded at making the paladin an extremely valuable asset to your team!)<br />  - The twentieth level ranger isn't someone you are going to want on your tail when he achieves the status of \\"Master Hunter.\\" He'll now be able to track his favored enemies while moving at full speed, and when he does catch up with him, her, or it, he can execute a single attack that has the chance of slaying his target outright.<br />  - Meanwhile the rogue gains \\"Master Strike,\\" which allows him to possibly put his target to sleep (if he's feeling nice), paralyze his target (if he's feeling not-so-nice), or assassinate his target on the spot (if he's feeling really pissed off).<br /><br />* The System *<br />Overall, Pathfinder plays and feels like classic Dungeons & Dragons 3.5. There are a few subtle, but very helpful enhancements to problematic and hard to remember rules. The simplification and rebalancing of all of the rules surrounding grappling, tripping, sundering, and bull-rushing into one unified system, for example, means no more having to flip open the book to figure out how to resolve these actions every time they come up --while wishing hellfire and brimstone upon the head of your player's monk, no doubt.<br /><br />Skills have been cleaned up, consolidating some and completely removing others. This will make it much easier for your character to focus on a core set of skills that really matter to him.<br /><br />Spells seem relatively unchanged from their previous versions with a few notable exceptions, such as with polymorph being split into multiple distinct spells. The biggest difference I noticed was cleric domains, which got a very nice overhaul. Oh, and cleric fans, your new group heal class feature is going to let you actually be able to use more of your spells for something other than healing even at low levels - \\"Divine Favor\\" anyone?<br /><br />* Using Pathfinder with Other d20 Products *<br />Although there have been a lot of enhancements to the classes and tweaks to the rules, the Pathfinder RPG remains compatible with other OGL/3.5 supplements. This is a big selling point for Pathfinder, as there is already an extensive library of supporting products. The core classes in Pathfinder are a little more powerful than their third edition predecessors, so if you're using monsters from other sources, you may need to adjust their challenge ratings down just a smidge. There are no specific guidelines in the final rules, but the beta version suggested adding a few extra feats, powers, skills and hitpoints to your villains; adding more monsters to your encounter; or otherwise building encounters as about one challenge rating level higher. I suspect this advice still holds true.<br /><br />There are a couple of other on-the-fly changes you will need to make when using third party sources. Some skills have been combined or changed, so you'll need to be familiar with the new skill list and determine the equivalent skill in Pathfinder. The rules for grappling and other maneuvers such as tripping, bull rushing, and sundering have also changed. This means that you'll need to determine the Combat Maneuver Attack and Defense scores for any 3.5e creatures you use. Luckily, these statistics are pretty straightforward to figure out.<br /><br />* Artwork and Print Quality *<br />Cover to cover, this is a visually appealing book, with all of the artwork presented in full color. The inserts between chapters are especially amazing; I would love to have some of these as posters in my gaming room. Flowing watermarks swirl around the edges of each page, giving the book an ornate feel without obscuring the text or making it difficult to read. The binding also feels sturdy, which is necessary for this many pages. Out of curiosity, I gave the text a good rub to see if it shared any of the notorious smudging problems of Fourth Edition, and I was relieved to find that it did not.<br /><br />* My Thoughts *<br />The one thing that I think this book really could have been improved by was more callouts. As a longtime player of Third Edition, I tend to want to skim over the parts that seem familiar and go straight to the changes. I started to do this with this book, and found immediately when I made my first character that I had missed a well-hidden rule that explained how first level hitpoints were generated. It had been tucked away in the terms and definitions section which I had been quick to skip over. With so many subtle changes to the rules, callouts that pointed out key changes from 3.5e would have made jumping into this new edition a lot easier.<br /><br />Nonetheless, after having played a couple of sessions using the final rules, I could scarcely be happier with what Paizo has done. The rules flowed nicely, and most importantly kept out of the way until needed. Combatwas also quick and easy, and the Pathfinder RPG has made it easier than ever to keep the action flowing without a lot of downtime.

B001CISHU4|2.0|After the truly remarkable 'With Oden on Our Side', I was eagerly awaiting the next offering from Amon Amarth. So after receiving the new album I was somewhat dumbfounded to find it of quite a different caliber indeed! In spite of several listens I just do not enjoy it at all, and find the songs uninteresting musically and thematically, they seem to drone along without significant development. While the bands' playing is good as usual, the addition of guest players seems not to have helped at all - in fact quite the reverse, with sound type changes that appear obviously out of character jumping out at you, disrupting the integrity of the songs. All up, a disappointing next album - get 'With Oden on Our Side' if new to this band.
B001OQCV2Y|4.0|\\"You haven't seen war until you've seen it through the eyes of Quentin Tarantino.\\" The tagline for Inglourious Basterds is certainly fitting, as Quentin Tarantino's take on the battles waged during World War II is definitely unlike anything you've ever seen. Sadly, when you disrupt the events and ideas many know as being historically accurate, you add even one more concept that works against the already arduous struggle for the suspension of disbelief. But it wouldn't be Tarantino without these brazen storytelling techniques, and fans of his elaborate style of moviemaking will find plenty to love with the ample servings of clever dialogue, spatterings of brutal violence, and a revenge story built for a truly explosive conclusion.<br /><br />Once upon a time in Nazi occupied France, young Jewish refugee Shosanna Dreyfus (Melanie Laurent) witnesses the slaughter of her family by Colonel Hans Landa (Christoph Waltz). Narrowly escaping with her life, she plots her revenge several years later when German war hero Fredrick Zoller (Daniel Bruhl) takes a rapid interest in her and arranges an illustrious movie premiere at the theater she now runs. With the promise of every major Nazi officer in attendance, the event catches the attention of the \\"Basterds\\", a group of Jewish-American guerilla soldiers led by the ruthless Lt. Aldo Raine (Brad Pitt). As the relentless executioners advance and the conspiring young girl's plans are set in motion, their paths will cross for a fateful evening that will shake the very annals of history.<br /><br />Tarantino's style of filmmaking hasn't changed much between his last few films; fortunately he has a fairly unique approach to storytelling that works well, so the repetition is forgivable. Inglourious Basterds is typical Tarantino: drawn out, musing, thought-provoking and witty dialogue, an excessive attention to detail, chapters and flashing character name/title notifications, and a sarcastic, darkly humorous angle on over-the-top violence. \\"The Germans will be sickened by us!\\" yells fanatical, compassionless leader Raine. Some scenes drag noticeably with beefed up dialogue that never quite bores, but the culmination of events, the crossing paths of characters, and the outrageous climax more than makes up for the extra time Tarantino has the audience seated in a theater chair. It's unexpected, historically inaccurate, and no-holds-barred entertaining. And Christoph Waltz turns in an absolutely show-stealing performance as the calculating villain.<br /><br />A slow-motion zap to the senses, with the Basterds turning the tables on history and the Nazis, Tarantino's obvious love of manipulation and movies finds its way into this offbeat war picture, along with in-depth conversations on Linder vs. Chaplin, strudels, milk and the expected racial remarks. He demonstrates his ability to toy with the audience through great musical selections, uneasy laughs to break up tension, a proficient arrangement of coincidences, and extreme anticipation - at times the suspense is delightfully overbearing. Considering Tarantino's sizable pop culture grasp on cinephiles and teenagers everywhere, it's safe to assume that for years to come people will be misspelling \\"inglorious\\" and \\"bastards\\" and will be unable to accurately retell key events of World War II.<br /><br />- The Massie Twinss will be sickened by us!\\" yells fanatical, compassionless leader Raine.

B000HWXS2S|5.0|I bought this together with 'Fate of Norns' and while both are good albums, 'With Oden on Our Side' shines through in an altogether different league. I'd rate it as one of the best metal albums - period. Why? Well I can recall the first time I played it, just putting it in the cd player and going about whatever I was doing - and coming back closer to the stereo, sitting down and listening to the whole thing. Engaging is one way of describing it, I felt like I'd been on a Viking raid myself! Just tremendous, the songs are emotionally intense, and the thematic material interesting, plus the bands playing is very good, with moderately complex melodies and great guitar and drum work. This album made such an impression that I've gone on and explored the medal genre as a result. Highly recommended, even if you are not a typical metal fan.
B00001SIES|3.0|3 1/2    While everyone was being distracted by their increasingly epic releases, this straightforward guitar-driven debut was relegated to encasement around here, only to have its ambitious energy affirmed with impressive if seldom revisitation.
0307341569|3.0|I liked Dark Places. It has quite a hook: Little Libby Day is in dire need of cash and is coaxed into meeting with the so-called Kill Club. There, she meets a large group of guys willing to dive into famous crime cases and debate, argue and try and figure out what really went on behind the scenes. Libby's childhood is just one of these cases. Her brother apparently murdered her sisters and mother and is now rotting away in jail. And that's fine with her until she finds out that more people than not actually believe he is innocent and that she was coached into making everyone believe her brother carried out the murder spree on that dark, cold night.<br /><br />So she decides to get some answers. For the money.<br /><br />The narrative unfolds through present time with Libby and past accounts by various members of the Day family on that fateful day. Flynn's writing is solid and poetic at times and Libby is definitely an interesting female lead. It was fun to read her parts and Ben's. Flynn also did a great job capturing what it's like to be an outcast during your high school years. Very spot-on.<br /><br />I read through the entire book in a single night and it was very entertaining but towards the end, I kept waiting for something to jump out and surprise me. When it was all said and done and I closed the book, I ultimately felt that it lacked that certain punch that the climax of a good mystery gives you. It just kind of fell a little flat for me. This may not be the case with other readers but I figured I'd voice how I came away from it.<br /><br />It's a dark novel and kind of depressing. But if you liked Sharp Objects or Gill's writing, pick it up and try it out. Just don't expect to be blown away.

Sanderson's systems (yes, systems as there are more than one) of magic, although not entirely unique, is very different from that found in other books.  It's also very cool.    The first book in the series follows Vin, a skaa from the streets with trust issues.  She is a character that will require more than one book to love and get to know, but that's not meant to be a knock on the author.  It's actually one of the reasons you like her.  She doesn't just evolve and change overnight.    The book is relatively fast-paced.  Most, if not all of the characters, have their faults.  I rarely, if ever, found myself reading/skimming through a chapter that focused on a character I didn't like reading about.  There is a depth to them that is good enough for the series, but it doesn't give you the feeling that you're going to be reading about them in other side projects or that there will be any prequels or other books outside of the trilogy - although the story of the Lord Ruler, in greater detail, could be interesting.    This is an exciting beginning to a new series.  I picked it up because he was taking over for Robert Jordan.  I suggest you give it a whirl, too.
0375751513|5.0|Those poignant words spoken by the devil (Al Pacino) in The Devil's Advocate come to mind when talking about Dorian Gray. As a young, beautiful and conceited man, Dorian finds comfort in the company of Lord Henry, a morally corrupt aristocrat in Victorian England. Already teetering on the verge of chronic narcissism, Dorian is pushed off the edge into the abyss of eternal damnation by Henry's seductive, imaginative, and in the end, destructive speech.<br /><br />This classic, cautionary tale of the woes of youth has vanity at its core. Dorian, like all of us, is afraid of becoming irrelevant and unloved as a consequence of old age. Only in his case, he let his paranoia coupled with bad influence (Lord Henry) devour him. The story isn't unique in the sense that it happens everyday in the form of inconsequential lives consumed by gyms, beauty salons and drugs, chasing reluctant love and evasive youth.<br /><br />If you haven't read this classic in school, I highly recommend you do now. Lord Henry's lines, though evil, are very entertaining and almost too poetic. No man I know has a wit and sharp tongue like Lord Henry, but again, he is not a man. He is the devil's incarnate.
B002G1YPH0|5.0|I stumbled upon this item on accident. I was originally looking at the OCZ Vendetta II but decided to pick this up instead because it was $7 cheaper, excellent online reviews, and future-proof ability. Installation was a hastle because once more I had to remove motherboard from the CoolerMaster 690, but I enjoy the peace of mind with a well mounted hefty heatsink vs the push pins used by other heatsinks of the same proportions.        I have yet to take advantege of using dual 120mm fans, the factory fan seems to be suffice to keep my 3.75Ghz 1.36vcore e5200 consistant at 52C 24hrs on prime95. I cannot distinguish between the noise of this and the three other stock fans in my case except for my XFX9800GT's factory fan. I will recommend this to any enthusiast and even lable the product a \\"must have\\". I am looking forward to mounting this on a future planned socket 1366 or 1156. Have a good day.
B00005JPLW|4.0|300 is the movie that goofy, melodramatic, silly historical war films like Braveheart and The Last of the Mohicans should have been.  300 wastes no time with stupid overblown, overplayed love stories (though there is a scene of $#% here), scenes of hair ripping tepidness, or a hokey in the middle of road tone that murders both films.  300 goes for the entire deep end and gives us an over the top, glorious, OPERATIC, no-holds barred depiction of being an ancient warrior.  There's no attempts of meaningful poignant drama here, and it sure as hell ain't subtle.  300 makes Spartacus look like Pride and Prejudice.<br /><br />Make no mistake, 300 is a war film along with comic book and action, though certainly not your traditional, typical war film.  This is a bloody, over-the-top, and utterly insane depiction of war that will appeal to any guy's inner warrior.  Sounds lame, but it's true.  This is as simple as a depiction of war you can get.  There's no soft sides, there's no morality issues, and there's no mixed emotions involved.  These men are made to kill, and protect their country with honor, and nothing else.  Yeah, it's occasionally silly, and it's definitely not a movie to be taken seriously.  But it's no holds barred, unapologetic fantasy war epic that has more testosterone than a thousand protein shakes in a row.<br /><br />I wouldn't quite say it depicts the Persians as pure evil and most of them as soldiers, but it certainly draws a not so subtle line between the two armies.  Anybody who is offended by stereotypes will want to steer away from 300 rather quickly.  One of 300's main criticisms is the depictions of the Ancient Persians, especially the king.  Truthfully, I feel there are stereotypes, but most of the persian soldiers are, as a matter of fact, just treated like regular soldiers; I never see them as freaks or evil entities.  Despite that, there is a definite bias against the Persians, but that wasn't the point anyway.  This film was certainly not to represent Zack Snyder and Frank Miller's view on reality.<br /><br />Anyway, 300 is essentially a fanciful, operatic re-telling of the Battle of Thermopylae, where 300 battled a severe number of Persians against unmeasurable odds....and lost.  What is largely an ordinary war story is brought to life in honor, a fantastic, stylized, epic re-imagining, filled with monsters, lot's of blood and thunder, bombastic musical scores, high use of stylized violence, and beautiful, sepia-toned visuals.  The Greek and Persian war is depicted at maximum stylized indulgence, it waters down nothing and cranks all of the traits (musical score, visuals, dialogue) to the max.  The feel is a bit hard to describe, and I can metaphor this with everything from God Of War (awesome game series by the way) to Clash of the Titans, but it wouldn't matter anyway.  All you will have to do is see for yourself and you'll know what I mean.<br /><br />I won't go into the details regarding the historical inaccuracies, that's not even the point anyway.  For some reason, Zack Snyder says that the movie is about 90 percent accurate, and that historians actually say it's accurate (how's that for an interesting alternate opinion).  Frankly, I don't know if that's remotely true, but it's an interesting counterpoint to the people who think it's the most inaccurate disgraces to history known to man.  Whether that's true or not, 300 can get away with being inaccurate, so it doesn't matter much.<br /><br />Everybody knows what makes 300 stand out is it's style.  Sure, it's not for everybody, but the ultra-stylized blue-screen visuals are visually stunning, that shine with a golden glow, heightening the operatic and bombastic style of the film.  Over 8631 visual effect elements were used in the film, and it leads for some cutting-edge, visually dazzling elements, eye candy as the best kind.  Furthermore, Zack Snyder's direction and the score is another element that's crucial to 300's style.  Snyder's excessiveuse of slow motion is in great supply here, letting us highlight, stylishly, combat, things falling, and key moments to draw out the drama.  The score is a bit varied, but it's always colorful, operatic, and animated to make this movie as over the top and crazy as possible.  Can't forget the narration done by David Wenham, which gives the feel of a mythological narrative.  He adds to the film as much as Jim Dale did for Pushing Daisies<br /><br />To be told, 300 really doesn't have as much action as one might think, as I truthfully feel that 300 is more of a war movie than an action movie, albeit one that takes seriously liberties (though you probably know that already).  As a matter of fact, I think The Thin Red Line has more combat depicted than this film, or at least among the same amount.  When the action does start, however, it's a bloody, gory good time.  It's mostly hand to hand combat.  Every stab, cut, and bleeding is emphasized here, and it makes for a blast of a film.<br /><br />300 gets criticisms for it's characters, and while I think criticisms are valid, I have to admit I don't find them as lifeless as people are making it out to be.  While these men are truly supposed to be fearless warriors who will stop and nothing to win, I feel that many of them seem to actually have a shred of humanism at times.  There's no layers to these people, and they push dependable buttons, but certainly likeable.  As I said before, the Persian soldiers seem to be viewed from a distance, we don't know most of these soldiers, so who are we to judge them? Faceless (with some awkward doses of homoeroticism), yes, but certainly not portrayed as evil.<br /><br />300 is certainly not for everybody, but if you are looking for an endlessly entertaining and non-tepid,animated look at ancient greek combat, and can handle a bit of silliness at times, 300 is your movie.

B001FB4W0W|5.0|This is an amazing show!!! I didnt have cable for the first season, so I purchased the 1st season on DVD...LOVED IT! and now purchased cable just to be up to date on the second season.  My sunday nights are True Blood night.  It does not matter where I am or what I am doing, I make sure I am home by 8pm (central time) to watch the show.  It's a smart, witty, well written show.  The characters have so much depth (some more than others) and the different layers makes them intriguing to watch and decipher.  I recommend this show to all my friends and everyone that has not yet experienced it, please make it a point to watch it.  After you been \\"BITTEN\\" by True Blood, you will be turned to it religiously.
039472903X|5.0|This book inspired me to a career in advertising and marketing. But not just general advertising and marketing. Direct Response advertising and marketing.    David Ogilvy is known as the Father of Image Advertising, but what impressed me most about this book was the description of Mr. Ogilvy's scientific approach to advertising.     From layout to copy, from headlines to offers, this is the Bible for advertising people. But like the Bible, so few know and realize the gems contained therein.     It is a mistake not to read this book if you're an advertising person. To read it and fail to apply it is criminal.
B00005RYKU|4.0|THE GLASS HOUSE is one of the better PG-13 thrillers out there. It has some actual suspense and never stoops to being a typical teen movie. Leelee Sobieski (Joy Ride) is excellent in the role of Ruby, a girl who finds herself without parents after a fatal car crash. She and her brother (Trevor Morgan from Jurassic Park 3) must live with their godparents, Terry (Stellan \\"Bootstrap Bill\\" Skarsgard) and Erin (Diane Lane) Glass. At first, everything seems fine, until Ruby begins noticing some increasingly unsettling goings-on. Of course, this leads to dark revelations and catastrophic events! TGH is full of mystery, tension, and plenty of creepy pseudo-parenting. Skarsgard is quite convincing in his slimy persona, and Ms. Lane is dependable as always. Also, watch for Bruce Dern (Silent Running, The Incredible 2-Headed Transplant) and Kathy Baker (Edward Scissorhands) as a lawyer and a socialworker respectively...

B000FA5QEK|4.0|You'll either love or hate this book.     For me, it changed the way I looked at how money actually works and taught me that the only person you'll make rich by working for a boss IS the boss.     Regardless of whether or not you take the real estate advice on board (a bit seminar, preachy-ish) or not, pay attention to the concept of where your income comes from and how you can use structures to minimise what you need to pay out of your own income.     It's true that a lot of things he says you can do through corporations just aren't that simple (damned tax laws) but the idea I took from the book is that it doesn't matter if you end up paying Fringe Benfits Tax or Income Tax or whatever if you don't physically have to get up in the morning and work for 'The Machine' to earn it. Even still, there ARE advantages to having your assets in corps and trusts and this provides an excellent intro to those concepts (if not the definitive resource).     As with any self-help/finanical advice book, if you spend $20, take only 1 thing from it and that 1 thing saves you even $20 down the track then it's paid for itself.
B00139W3NE|1.0|I'm not generally into rating things as a nonChristian....actually I consider myself \\"spiritual not religious\\" but after reading the trilogy I felt compelled to warn others. While the story is fine for the first 2 books when you get to the 3'rd it turns out the plot is about \\"God\\" being a fake and satin being the only one smart enough to recognize it...this part of the story is narrated by 2 homosexual angles. It just went too far for me and I wish I'd know that this is what the trilogy was about before I started it.

0800141660|5.0|Before watching this movie, I was not truly a Jane Austen fan -- I was a \\"Pride and Predjudice\\" fan. I love Pride and Predjudice, and wanted more of Jane Austen as a result, but Mansfield Park and Fanny Price dissapointed me after the sparkle and romance of her better known love story. I was mistaken in thinking none of her other works could give as much pleasure as the first I was introduced to. Sense and Sensibility is a serious, deep, romantic work, exploring the cpmplexities of human thought and behavior. The movie is amazingly faithful to the book. The actors perform the characters they portray with acurracy, passion, and respect. Prepare to be taken, heart and soul.

0192802372|5.0|Like all Jane Austen's works, Emma is a tale of self-discovery. Emma Woodhouse is used to her position of consequence as mistress of her widowed father's house, and proud lady of an old, respected family. She over-estimates her own power and importance, running into trouble when she tries to govern the affairs of her neighbors. Mr. Knightly, brother of her sister's husband, scolds and chides while her senile daddy worries more about her staying up too late, or dancing in a crowded room. Mr. Knightly is always right, as, over and over, the strong-willed Emma is forced to admit; but the reformation of her ideas may be too late in coming. He goes away to London just when she realizes she cannot be happy without first place in his heart. A must read for all fans of classic literature.
B0000DJE9R|5.0|Just thrilled with this CD and would recommend to anyone. I love listening to this great artist -- he was only 5 years younger than me and all of us in our 50's remember what a great talent he was. He lives via his great music which penetrates my heart and soul.
B000E5N62U|5.0|Rock n roll is a very pure art form, in the sense that in its ideal form it doesn't often take a lot of training to get to the point where an artist is able to express him/herself.  This of course is a double-edged sword.  For bands like The Ramones or Nirvana, for example, the untrained thing worked brilliantly.  But for too many young bands, I am increasingly finding that a punk aesthetic is used to mask an inability to write songs or play instruments.  Perhaps that's why I tend to be the anomalous early-thirty-something who spends quite a lot of listening time on music like that found on the \\"Morph The Cat\\" disc.<br /><br />Call this what you will - it tends to get labeled \\"adult contemporary\\" or some such - Donald Fagen's work is really a smartly sleek extension of Steely Dan's sophisticated jazz-pop.  Meticulously sculpted with witty, clever lyrics that often tell a story, the music sounds modern and oddly retro at the same time.  The musicianship is of course refreshingly excellent, and repeat listens reveal new aspects of these carefully layered compositions.  It's something you can really sink your teeth into, so to speak, and will reward repeated listens.<br /><br />I can't wait to hear a new band that plays music like this.  Until then, at least the old guard is still reliably cranking out collections that give music fans something worth their time.
0375842209|5.0|I must say that this book was one of the most captivating novels I have read!  Death tells a wonderful tale, sometimes very difficult to read.  In fact, I wasn't sure where this book was going to take me considering the end is told in the beginning of the book...and from there the reader is taken on a journey of Liesel's life, the good and the bad.  My heart ached for Liesel, for Max and really for the role death played in this book.  I would normally not have picked this up, I would have let this slip away and I am so very happy I gave it a try!

B001B1UO6W|5.0|This long-awaited special edition DVD of \\"Child's Play\\" is worth the wait. Not only is the film finally available in widescreen (after being sold as a full-screen movie at a cheap price), but there a ton a bonus features that makes this edition a must-have, not only for Chucky fans, but for horror buffs everywhere. There is a very informative commentary with Alex Vincent( who played the little boy in the movie), Catherine Hicks, and Kevin Yager. The featurette \\"Evil Comes In Small Packages\\" discusess how one of the screen's most evil characters came to be created and how the movie was made. The film still amazingly holds up even after 20 years which is a testament to how good the film is. Watch how a simple doll kills and destroys those around it and see what lengths this evil will go to. The other Chucky films are also available in a beautiful boxset. The reason the original \\"Child's Play\\" is not available with those films is they were made by a different studio.
0804115613|5.0|Extremely well written. Unique organization. I fell in love with the movie so I had to buy the book. When it arrived I couldn't wait to dive right into it. So I did. The book is so wonderful the characters are lovable. I found myself laughing out loud at some points (seriously in study hall I started laughing uncontrollably and got some raised eyebrows). I also cried out loud. My English teacher also recommends it. Although BE WARNED: Any bigots don't even buy it Ruth and Idgie are portrayed as lesbians. Funny, sad, all around page-turner. BUY THIS BOOK!
0765342294|5.0|I read this book when it first came out after my daughter got it. The book reminds me alot of the \\"Lord of the Flies\\" where children who have to grow up quick miss out on developing many of the kinder emotions we rely on as adults. This book is heartbreakingly cruel in many ways. It shows what happens when children become tools of the adult world. Ender is a smart boy trying to survive in a environment where the wrong step can result in the death of oneself, a companion or an unknown entity. I thought the writing was very descriptive and drew you deeply into this futurist world. It is a must read and I can't figure out why the author felt the need to defend this writing. Maybe the readers who did not like it were looking for \\"easy to read fluff\\" and this book was too deep for them.  If you want to read something that makes you think, stays with you long after you finish reading it (as it did for me) and makes you feel real emotions, read this.
B000006UD8|5.0|I was very impressed by the music on this album.  The soongs that stand out most being Highway Star, Smoke on the Water, and Lazy.  I have listened to at least one song on the album almost every day since i got it. I love it that much!    The only thing is that having both CD's is rather unnecessary, seeing as they are very similar, but i prefer the remixed versions for the slightly extended solos.    The booklet has a lot of great information on how the album was recorded and was pretty cool to read though.    And even further it turns out i look like Ian Gillian when he was that age....  weird.    This is a great album for anyone looking at deep purple just because it has some of their best songs and much variety on it.
B001U0HBPG|3.0|I was somewhat ambivalent about watching this movie, but it had such a strong cast that I decided to give it a whirl. The central premise of this film is a fantastical one. A baby is born old, exhibiting all the indicia of very old age, but unlike those born with progeria, the baby, as it grows and develops, gets younger. While not a bad film, it is not a particularly good one either, despite all its bells and whistles. Sure it has lots of intriguing special effects, but the story somehow meanders about and falls flat.  Though comparisons have been made to \\"Forrest Gump\\", this film pales in contrast, because \\"Forrest Gump\\" was a great film, and this one is not.<br /><br />When Benjamin is born, his mother dies after giving birth to him. The grieving father, horrified by the wizened appearance of his new born son, takes him and abandons him on the steps of an old age home, where he is taken in by a woman who runs the home. In the wise, loving arms of his adopted mother, Benjamin grows into manhood. Surrounded by old people who accept him, after all, he physically mirrors them, life is good to Benjamin. There he also meets Daisy, the granddaughter of one of the residents, and is smitten. Even though they are close in age, she looks like the child she is, while he looks as if he could be her grandmother's husband. She will, however, always be the love of his life.<br /><br />While they part and grow into adulthood, at one point they look almost the same age and before you know it, Benjamin and Daisy are joined at the hip. True love has blossomed and finally been made possible while they are in their forties, and it is great while it lasts. Alas, the inevitability of Benjamin's future looms forbiddingly, and there is simply no happy ending, only a very poignant one.<br /><br />While there are many great performances in this film, and Cate Blanchett is positively luminous, Brad Pitt's performance is somewhat moribund. While a bit disappointing, his performance is not what does this film in. The film is done in by its own emotional torpor. There is simply not enough of an emotional connection to the viewer, causing this very lengthy film to drag and leaving the viewer to ask, \\"What was the point?\\".

1400063515|5.0|A great antidote to all the bullS*%t that tends to float around our lives (and our heads) on any given day. The author is a bit, shall we say, priggish, but his ability to counter-argue so much of what we take for granted was a welcome change of pace.
B0018YIFEK|5.0|I am a new Jodi Picoult fan, and must say, her books are fantastic!  I loved My Sister's Keeper - cried like a baby. It was very disappointing that the movie didn't even have the same ending!  Great authors like Jodi Picoult shouldn't allow Hollywood to re-create their best-sellers.  Books are usually better than the movie, but in this case, it was so off base, it was ridiculous.<br /><br />The characters in this story are so real - you find yourself cheering and tearing for each of them.  Even the attorney.  Great book!!!!
B00273D3YS|5.0|This has to be one of Michael Jackson's top 3 all-time greatest albums. Before Michael became strange this album captures what the \\"King of Pop\\" is best at: Pop/R&B. Carefully chosen tracks from proven songwriters (Carole Bayer Sager, Rod Temperton, Stevie Wonder, Paul McCartney)and a few tracks of his own added to a brilliant producer are all the ingredients of a great album.<br /><br />Now, this disc has also been remastered par excellence and been given the mini-lp replica sleeve design (mlps) gatefold treatment! I have never heard such a great sounding remastering job in my life and believe me I've heard too many pretenders and alleged remastering jobs that even sound worse than the pre-remastered version.  This mlps version is very well designed and assembled from very good thick quality cardboard that is built to last.  There is a fold out track listing with an essay in Japanese as well as a 20-page booklet with all the lyrics in both English and Japanese.<br /><br />The best tracks are the title track, \\"Don't Stop Till You Get Enough\\", and my favourite \\"Rock With You\\" but the other tracks, written by great hall-of-fame songwriters are great too and make the whole package cohesive and overall just a great album.<br /><br />For the diehard fan, there are even bonus outtakes and interviews with Quincy Jones and Rod Temperton although personally I feel they should have either left this out or put it on a separate disc but I guess I can always stop the disc after \\"Burn This Disco Out.\\"<br /><br />This is probably the best version of this album that's out there and is highly recommended for all MJ fans out there.
B001IAO2QE|1.0|Oh where to begin...    A living, breathing Howard Roark-wannabe/fanboy recommended this book to me.  At the time, he was much older and more educated than I was, which for some reason made me respect his opinion.  I read the book, and slowly began to realize that this guy's life was so crappy because he thought he was so above everything...much like Roark.  And Rand, for that matter (well I don't know if her life was crappy, but she did think she was above everything...anyway).  I am at the point now where I cannot stand anyone who even has the slightest positive thing to say about this book or anything else Rand has ever written, or her pseudo-intellectual, slapped-together excuse for a \\"philosophy.\\"      Before reading the book, I knew nothing about Ayn Rand, and I just dove right into it, and I'll admit that it started out interesting.  I was expecting that powerful, classic novel that people raved about.  But then I noticed how condescending her prose was, and then it began to get annoying.  And then there were those PAINFULLY predictable and poorly developed characters that Rand's limited literary abilities created (but I guess that's what archetypes are meant to be).  The plot itself was just as sorry as the characters.  My initial expectation was that I would remember this book forever...and I certainly will, but not in the way that I had hoped.    Honestly, trudging through this piece of crap was worse than reading one of those anecdotal examples from a sociology or philosophy textbook, as I've found that textbook authors can be better at developing characters than actual novelists.  I am shocked, appalled, and disgusted that the Fountainhead has so many fans.    In the past, I have been able to enjoy books without agreeing with the author's personal views or even liking the protagonist, as there are a lot of authors out there who can actually write.  The plots were interesting, the prose was exemplary, and the characters weren't so one dimensional.  Rand,on the other hand, spent her life telling herself that she was a genius whilst peddling the BS that so many refer to as \\"literature.\\" If you start this book, don't bother finishing it.  The ending is a joke.    Halfway through the book, something entered my mind: does this woman hate ANYTHING that remotely resembles a cohesive society, or just anything that might reek of socialism?  Then I read her bio, and it made sense: she hated being in the Soviet Union, which is understandable, as many people did, and I suppose that sort of explains her obsession with individualism.  And I'm all for individualism and achievement...but since when does disrespecting everyone around you and designing ugly buildings and refusing to coexist harmoniously with the world in general qualify as achievement?  How is that noble?  I mean, I suppose it's lovely to promote bettering oneself and setting goals and getting what you want out of life, but the whole \\"stick it to the man\\" thing is so overdone and unrealistic in most circumstances.  Besides, many people can be individuals and achieve their goals without completely dismissing the society that allowed them to in the first place.  Once again, if Rand was a more talented author, I could look past her philosophical views and get on with enjoying the book, but unfortunately, that wasn't the case.    If you're interested in philosophy, read something else.  Or a textbook.  It'll be more fulfilling.  Or read a comic book, so at least there will be pictures to look at every time you feel the need to roll your eyes at all the cliches.  But if you STILL want to become acquainted with the Fountainhead, read the Wikipedia synopsis.  The contributors to that page aren't necesarily much better writers than Ayn Rand, but you'll get the gist of the \\"story\\" within a few minutes.    But if you're truly interested in Ayn Rand's self assured \\"brilliance,\\" go ahead and read the Fountainhead.  You'll realize that anyone who openly celebrates it is a moron.
1594202249|4.0|Besides the convoluted crime plot which never lets up, delivering the goods time after time, what's of primary interest here is how people change, how they wholeheartedly believe one thing one day and how over time that belief is turned on its head and their lives and beliefs become the antitheses of what they were when they were younger. What is the process involved here? This is what Pynchon wants to know, and though he typically foists the responsibility onto soulless authority figures who have their own occult reprogramming methods, he never does find out the deeper, more personal (even biological) reasons. It's just what happens, though he doesn't want to accept this. The only alternative for the individual of integrity is to remain on the fringes and resist that change.    Doc Sportello, PI, plays that role in \\"Inherent Vice\\" even as he's investigating why all the changes are happening. He's an amiable guy, content to drift and flow along with herbal assistance, but he's also a shadowy figure, a kind of transitional figure working both sides, as he makes his living by working for unscrupulous people; and late in the book an ex calls him on this very fact, and it hits him hard. But how can he get out? Deep down he knows how much he resembles the very cop who is his nemesis. What a bind!    Doc reminded me a little of \\"Ghost Dog\\" (from the Jarmusch movie): gentle to the core, even sweet, but capable of violence. There's a great scene late in the book where Doc, grateful that he's not too stoned, engages in his own version of Samurai warrior violence---flowing with a deadly flow---to kill a thoroughly repugnant individual. This single moment of violence surprised me and added a depth to the character, an intensity that seemed absent until then.    I only detected a little reverberative cultural relevance to the contemporary world. One was a primitive computer network that Doc consults from time to time with the assistance of a friend. This was an early manifestation of the internet, so it allows Pynchon a few openings to insert anti-web barbs: how the knowledgeable individual will be expendable, how all the info only adds up to a big hollowness, and of course how nobody will be able to hide. But then at the end of the book, in a very lovely concluding passage in a dense California fog, as a convoy of strangers in cars help each other make a safe passage on difficult roads, he speculates that in the future of instant communication and info retrieval these strangers would connect with each other as it's happening, and would even instantly organize annual reunions to commemorate their moment of brotherhood. I suspect he's being at least partly ironic in his praises, and lamenting the loss of anonymity in such situations, but there's also a concession to the real bonding that can occur between strangers with the help of the internet and the proliferation of social networking tools.
0307387151|5.0|This is one of the most beautifully written and emotionally captivating books I've ever read.    I'll be honest...I saw the movie before I read the book, but it wasn't at all difficult to get through even though I already knew the ending.  The book is SO MUCH BETTER.  Since the movie leaves out quite a few significant chunks, the book will have some \\"new\\" parts that you can appreciate.  Ian McEwan has absolutely gorgeous prose...it's been criticized as \\"wordy,\\" but I don't really agree with that.  It's not nearly annoying enough to be wordy.  Besides, the plot is intense and heartbreaking and the characters are well developed for the most part, even if they don't get much of a voice.  If you hate his writing style, then you can rest assured that everything else is interesting enough to keep you going.      Calling McEwan an extremely gifted storyteller would be an understatement.  He isn't gimmicky and he doesn't try too hard to either fit a mold, or do extreme things for attention just for the sake of being different.  Even if you've already seen the movie, give the book a chance.  Read the plot summary on the back cover or on Amazon, and then get started.  This guy is now one of my favorite authors...his other stuff's pretty incredible too.
B0027VTMAE|5.0|this movie is a four to a five anything below is done by an idiot  lol  butt really it's a good suspense and i like all that goes on in the movie ,its kinda new ideas and thoughts in the movie and love the guy saying \\"i thought thats what we were doing\\" youll see its funny, it's worth the price i think it one of my favorites.
B000W8OM5Y|5.0|There are really very few films in cinema history that can be compared to this for sheer quality. The cinematography is breathtaking, the acting is top-notch (as is the screenplay) and need I even mention the score? I bought this a few months ago. Braveheart is one of my favorite films of all time, and this Special Collector's Edition does not disappoint. I will say just this: if you are a movie lover of any quality, and you do not own this film, GET IT! It is worth your while.    Note: While this is probably redundant, do not, repeat, DO NOT!!! show this film to young children. This is probably about the 2nd bloodiest film ever made. Under 13 will probably not be able to handle it.
B001F0TM5I|4.0|this is at least a four star movie and to some a five its different and crazy and lots of cool scenes
B001OQCV2Y|5.0|As a rabid fan of Tarantino (yes, I even loved Deathproof) I find I always look forward to any new effort by the director.  With Inglourious Basterds Tarantino yet again conveys an undying affection for any and all things cinema.  While the movie is a man on a mission film it is also a resistance movie and an ode to film.  It's also surprisingly funny and at times overwhelmingly violent and while those elements are trademark Tarantino, here he's mastered his form.<br /><br />Many people complained about the \\"talkiness\\" of Deathproof and in Inglourious Basterds QT has limited the verbage to a more economical and efficient pace.  This baby moves, and at nearly two and a half hours in length, that is quite an accomplishment.  Absolutely zero filler, fat, or fastidiousness.  It is quite a thing to realize you've watched a movie that lasts this long and, when it ends, you find yourself wanting more.  If there are any complaints to be made they would have to be that we don't spend merely as much time with the Basterds as the title of the film would imply.  But the time spent is all the better for it.<br /><br />I don't think enough can be said about Christoph Waltz's Col. Hans Landa.  Nicknamed \\"The Jew Hunter\\" the man is the embodiment of evil.  In one moment he's charming, the next he is unpent rage.  It's an altogether captivating performance, both verbose and vile.  While Hitler will always be the face of the Nazi regime it's the very real people like Landa that were the tools that carried out the atrocities of the holocaust.  The best way to describe the character is Sherlock Holmes spawned by the devil.  A detective with an unflinching eye and an uncaring heart.  Christoph Waltz will most likely earn many an award for his performance and Oscar buzz has been flying since Cannes.  Expect that buzz to get louder.<br /><br />Brad Pitt as Aldo Raine also turns in a fine performance as the rough and tumble leader of the Basterds who really, really, really wants his Nazi scalps.<br /><br />Eli Roth was a big ol' question mark for me going in to this movie as his character in Deathproof was annoying (although admittedly that was the point) but as Donny Donowitz (aka. The Bear Jew) he steals the scenes he's in.  While I've never been a fan of Roth's directing acumen (except for the surprising as hell Hostel 2) I will concede that he can indeed, act.<br /><br />The last real standout in the Basterds lineup was Til Schweiger as Stiglitz (the character with the best introduction in the whole movie), a German turned Nazi killer on his own accord.<br /><br />But the movie is not all about the Basterds.<br /><br />Melanie Laurent as Shosanna, the Jewish girl now running her own movie theater in Paris, has a history with Col. Landa and her own plot to rid the world of as many Nazis as she can.  Expect to see more of her in the future.<br /><br />Diane Kruger plays Bridget Von Hammersmark, the double agent movie star.  Let's just say there's a reason she played Helen of Troy.<br /><br />Overall Inglourious Basterds is one of the best moviegoing experiences I've had in 2009.  If you've liked Quentin Tarantino's films in the past you'll most likely love this movie.  Besides, any film where the sole impetus is the killing and terrorizing of Nazis is aces in my book.was a big ol' question mark for me going in to this movie as his character in Deathproof was annoying (although admittedly that was the point) but as Donny Donowitz (aka.

B001AVCFK6|1.0|Absolutely dissatisfied with this product. I was certainly hopeful, after all of the wonderful product reviews that have already been posted here on Amazon, but it would not even play or bring up the menu screen in my Blu-ray player. The player didn't even recognize that there was a disc in there. It was almost as if there was nothing in there at all. Be sure to check out my picture of this product by staring at any empty spot in the space a few feet in front of you.     If anything changes after the November release date of this product, I will come back and update my review and rating at that time. I may be able to provide a better picture at that time as well.    Pros:     No box or material of any kind was used in creating this product (info accurate as of 8/21/09). Can't get any greener than that.    Cons:     Wouldn't play or even be recognized by my player. I expected more, based on the overwhelmingly positive product reviews of this non-existent product.
B001AR0D4A|4.0|this is good movie its kinda different and special effects are great the monsters look real and the people seem real except some or all seem little bit dumb to me, i wouldnt act like any of them.
1401923119|1.0|Show this book to any other molecular biologist, and they will find it laughable. They will easily be able to point out the many distortions and manipulations of science throughout the book.     The author presents himself as having great insight into human biology when in reality, he's just taking credit for well known, scientific discoveries and then twisting them to fit his theories.    Sadly, this book does very little to add to the knowledge and understanding of the mind body connection. For more information on this subject I would recommend authors like Andrew Weil or Daniel Amen.     In my opinion, authors like this one only deter from our having a better understanding of the effect that biology and psychology have on each other.
0545128285|5.0|My daughter is a huge fan of the Harry Potter movies.  She read this book and loved it.  She thought the book was silly and great, and really loved the dark magic.  My daughter said that the secret to reading is to take yourself into the book and enjoy it.
B000S56R1I|5.0|I believe this album is excellent.  I can see how other people would not appreciate Steven's style, because it is quite unusual; but, I believe, that is why is it so excellent.  It is different, each song has its own rhythm, flow, and beat.  It does not follow the standard (and boring!) method of a song that we are all, unfortunately, so used to: verse A, chorus, verse B, chorus, bridge, chorus, chorus.  It is difficult to pinpoint one favorite song because they are all great, and they each sound slightly different than the rest.  The songs really are poems that are set to music and sung.  Strongly recommend this if you are looking for something that will broaden your horizon and are looking for something outside of the top 40 on the radio!
B000W91RUG|5.0|It had to grow on me, but WOW, when that \\"Big Bang\\" finally hit me, I was hooked!  Great acting, great adult humor!  It has become my favorite TV series for comedy.  The guys are adorable with about every personality characteristic of which you can think.  Sheldon & Leonard are similar to a modern day \\"Odd Couple\\".  Very funny.
630522885X|1.0|The issue isn't whether this or that transfer is better or worse: this is a bad film that no amount of after-the-fact tinkering can save. Not even the great Ustinov can rescue this sprawling, miserable mess. The acting is cloyingly annoying, the story telling lurches like a carriage missing a wheel, the title role is filled by an actress who could put hummingbirds to sleep, and the music is like having a cream pie pounded into your ear. The crowds and critics were right the first time when they declared this film a flop upon its initial release. It's still a flop.
0385333846|5.0|...\\"Slaughterhouse Five\\" has it all.  It's great.  Ignore the handful of Amazon reviewers who dismiss the book as unserious.  They must be nitwits or authority-groupies.  The fact is that \\"Slaugtherhouse Five\\" has incredible moral force:  if anyone earned the right to write a black comedy about the destruction of Dresden, it was Vonnegut, who lived through it as a POW.  The book made a big impression on me at age 17 because it was so funny and irreverent.  Now that I'm 50, I'm mainly blown away by the pain and sadness of the story.  I finished \\"Slaughterhouse Five\\" several days ago, but the memory of the cryptic opening words -- \\"Listen:  Billy Pilgrim has come unstuck in time...\\" -- still makes the hair on my neck stand up.  This is daring, essential 20th century fiction.  Six stars.
B00004VYF6|3.0|After viewing some of the songs of this product on YouTube, I was under the happy impression that this performance would be a true representative of the exalted story written by Victor Hugo.    It appears I should have been the Pope of Fools.    Other than throwing in a few key elements of the story, it is very different from the novel. Phoebus is portrayed as a gallant man who is torn in love between Esmerelda and Fleur de Lis (in the book, he's in love with neither), Esmerelda fights his advances in the typical cat-and-mouse play of modern flirtation (as opposed to being fatally possessed with him), and Quasimodo is desperately in love with her from the start of the story, despite the fact that in the novel he does not love her until she has pity on him during his corporal punishment (a key dramatic act of the whole plot).    On the plus side, Frollo does come across as a man who is torn between heaven and hell, which is usually not portrayed in other variations of the story (i.e. he's not a villain with horns and a pitchfork). The actor who plays Gringoire does a great job in providing the mannerisms for this \\"philosopher\\" (too bad Djali isn't in the performance).    I would have given this a lower rating except for the beautiful music (particularly the song \\"Belle\\") and the phenomenal voices and acting by most of the actors and actresses. In short, if you enjoy aesthetic work qua aesthetics, you will enjoy this performance. If you are looking for a true adaptation of the movie, look elsewhere.
0792164903|5.0|Sleepy Hollow is one of the great horror films.  It's a Tim Burton film that is a mix of spookiness, evil, gore, and humor.  It all seems to work rather nicely.  The acting is top notch.  Johnny Depp is splendid in the role of Ichabod Crane.  Christopher Walken is perfect for the role of the Headless Horseman.  Christina Ricci does a great job as well in the role of Katrina Van Tassel.  Other notable actors that appear in this movie are Christopher Lee, Ian McDiarmid, Michael Gough, Michael Gambon, Miranda Richardson, Casper Van Dien and Jeffrey Jones.<br /><br />This is a scary movie with an atmosphere and setting that really works.  There is always an overcast sky with lots of fog and mist.  The trees in the woods are leafless and abundant.  The Headless Horseman's \\"home\\" is the scariest looking tree you'll ever see.  These things make the movie so dark and wicked.  The town dwellings and structures such as the church, the windmill and private residences fit so well with the time period.  This movie takes place in 1799.  Some of the props are plain scary looking, such as the scarecrow, for example.<br /><br />If you're up for a great horror movie, then definitely get this movie and watch it late at night on Halloween night after the trick-or-treaters have gone home and you've extinguished the jack-o-lantern.  It is scored by Danny Elfman, one of the great movie soundtrack composers.  The DVD also has commentary by director Tim Burton, a featurette on the making of the movie, cast biographies, cast and crew interviews, two theatrical trailers, a photo gallery and more.  This movie doesn't follow Washington Irving's novel to a T, but it is spooky and entertaining and that's what really matters in a movie like this.  Highly recommended.
B000PC0U1W|5.0|I saw the movie first, read the book after, and then watched the film again.  The creators of this film took intelligence and delicacy into making a nearly flawless adaptation.  Reason Being?  Material that didn't make it to film is what would have destroyed it.  V for Vendetta is not a word for word translation.  V the film is a updated and different approach with everything that was the heart and soul of the book.  They snipped and cut what they needed to and added fresh material to give the film more substance.<br /><br />I really feel sorry for Alan Moore after the LXG movie.  It really did no justice to him, and it did not display any of his writing talent.  V for Vendetta however is bleeding with Moore dialogue.  More than half of the films dialogue comes straight from the graphic novel, and it's really inspiring to see a hollywood movie do justice like that.  And even the new and different scenes compliment the Alan Moore setting like you never would have guessed.  Graphic novels like Watchmen and V are very cinematic but not everything can translate to film.  Although it was nearly the same, the Watchmen picture did have a entirely different ending.  This is simply because you can do different things in books that you can't in film.<br /><br />Hugo Weaving and Natalie Portman?  Who would have thought? This duo turned out to be the best idea the film had.  I'm not familiar with the other actors but they certainly deserve more and more screen time in their future.  Portman is significantly different from the girl in the novel, but it was a smart move for the film.  The independent and thought-provoking Evey in the film is way more interesting and inspiring than the girl in the book. Giving her a smarter role really gave the audience something more interesting.  And Hugo?  What can I say? Hugo has never basterdized a role in a film.  He was spot on with V.<br /><br />V for Vendetta is one of the benchmark comic book movies that really got it right.  After seeing this I regained hope for all adaptations, because this one director thought to preserve the art of the book, and not just sell it.  We really take for granted how much these people work to make a film an artwork, when one can simply just sell it with action, effects, and sexuality.  I hope when anyone watches this film they can feel rewarded and not sold.g this I regained hope for all adaptations, because this one director thought to preserve the art of the book, and not just sell it.

B001RTP3Z0|5.0|Leonard Cohen shows his brilliance in the concert.  We get our money's worth as he doesn't scrimp on the sheer volume of songs he presents, some from way back, and some more recent, a perfect balance.  The band and back-up singers are consistently excellent, musicians of the highest caliber. The range and complexity of his output is something to behold.  Leonard Cohen is our man.
B000ZEE3I6|1.0|Although it's not specifically mentioned, I'm going to comment that as Albus Dumbledore discovered the 12 uses of Dragon's Blood, I believe I have discovered at least one use of Dragon Poo -- the screenplay does manage to look better than this substance, but only just barely.  Granted, reducing 650-odd pages into a motion picture that runs in a reasonable amount of time is a daunting task, but forays into totally made up sequences (specifically the visit of Bellatrix LeStrange, Fenrir Greyback, etc to The Burrow), does nothing to advance the plot.    However, I did enjoy the interior of the set of the Hogwarts castle, as they made it seem much more like what I would expect a castle to look like.    Much more could and should have been made of the pensive sequences, especially with regard to Dumbledore's admonition to include Ron and Hermione in what Harry learned, especially given its relevance to the final book.  Much more could also have been made of Harry's obsession with discovering what Draco was up to, although those seemed to lack any real hint of what was going on in those sequences (but I have to admit that I liked Tom Felton's portrayal as well as his costume).    Yes, I'll get the DVD when it becomes available, if only to have the complete collection.  I just hope I don't also find a Draught of Living Death handy when I watch it.  Come to think of it, maybe Steve Kloves was under its influence when he penned this abomination.
B00000K3G8|4.0|I believe it has to do with which parts are more audible during the mixing/mastering of the original studio albums.  Heaven sounds better live, for reasons I can't explain.  Life During Wartime, Making Flippy Floppy, Once In A Lifetime, and Crosseyed and Painless don't sound as good on these live versions, supposedly because the main catchy keyboard/synthesizer riffs weren't brought to the front like they should be, so the melody was barely audible.  And some live recordings were better because the main riffs were louder on the live version than in the studio version, which was the case with Slippery People.  But overall it is a solid piece of work and most representative of their hits up until Speaking In Tongues, which I believe was the last really good album they released.

B001AVCFK6|5.0|I am not a long time fan of the original series. In fact, I have never seen any of the original episodes, but I have seen the movies and knew the storyline. To me, this film is a complete restart/reboot/updated version of the classic series, and I loved it! Everybody did an awesome job kick-starting the Star Trek franchise! It has great action sequences, awesome special effects, comedy, sexual tension between Spock and Uhura, and much more! I agree with the commercial, 'This is not your father's Star Trek' We see the birth of James Kirk, building the new U.S.S. Enterprise, Leonard Nimoy returns as the older Spock. The crew meet at Starfleet Academy and train for three years. An evil time-traveling Romulan named Captain Nero alters the past to mess up the future. When Captain Pike is kidnapped by Nero, a new Captain must rise to stop the bad guy! If you are a Trekkie, I highly recommend STAR TREK!!!
B000FGGE68|5.0|People seem to be pretty divided about how they liked this move, but I liked it. Milla Jovovich is so pretty, and it was nice to see her all the time. She really helps this movie a lot. But, I guess it helps if a person is a guy and single if they are really going to enjoy this film. There was good photography, good sets, and good music. I like it when a movie has good music. I liked it the way it didn't become night whenever there was a battle scene. There was plenty of light so people could see what was going on. And it helps if a movie has good reviews, i.e., well written & thought provoking, althought not necessarily this review, for I probably don't add much to the review excitement, but that cookieman guy did a good job of reviewing the movie. This is one of those movies where so much of the movie consists of close-ups of just one person's face, or, in the case of Milla, close-ups of her face and all of her. (Other movies purportedly consisting so much of close-ups of just one person's face include perhaps Nicole Kidman in The Interpreter, and Naomi Watts in The Ring Two.) But, of course, the rest of the movie is great, too. I liked it.

B0013FSL3E|1.0|Yes, I found Wall-E to be surprisingly crummy. I realize I may be committing heresy by being the lone voice to speak against the tide of people who loved this film.  (And I think this library computer is even mad at me, for it logged my out, thus erasing half my review, making me have to start all over again, while I answered a phone call and went out for a smoke.) And, actually, I'm not scaredy-cat of watching and liking family or kiddie movies. Why, just the other day I watched and liked Bridge to Terabithia. I watched Wall-E with my friend, and she always puts the subtitles on first no matter what the film. She and I can hear perfectly well...she just likes subtitles. She was exclainimg to me, \\"How are we supposed to know what they're saying without subtitles???\\" when the little robot things started to talk. And, frankly, that's what I say. I found the plot to be incoherent, like they were patching in additions to the plot as the movie went along. Both me and my friend were so bored and uninterested in Wall-E that, at the halfway point, we turned the DVD player off and took naps. We eventually watched the rest of the movie a few hours later. Sorry everybody; the movie just didn't do it for me, and I really wanted to like it, too.
0385484518|5.0|I value this book for its simplicity and authenticity. Undeniably, everyone has a `Morrie Shwartz' like figure in their lives. This book reflects on the immense value of  great mentors and how they shapes our thinking and attitude. It delves deep into the real meaning and worth of life and what matters most. There are many aspects of the book that are commendable, but the most impressive is where Morrie teaches his pupil to distinguish between `needs' and `wants'. This book would be a mere composition of much touted values but Morrie's humility and sincerity that radiates through the pages lends him credibility and makes this a compelling and unforgettable memoir.
0793518326|5.0|I am a long-time Beatle fan & I've been performing their music for over 30 years. My first song I worked on from this collection was \\"Nowhere Man\\" which I just finished about 2 weeks ago. Where I would usually write parts out it was great to just open the book & check the accuracy of the parts which were spot on, especially Ringo's drum part. I had most of the harmonies worked out but gained a nice insight into the crossed voices that happens in the first lines of every verse. I probably shaved at least a weeks work using this. I started working on \\"No Reply\\" right after finishing \\"Nowhere Man\\" & had it completed in less than a week. My only complaint: the printing is just too bloody small & I have to switch from my reading glasses to my computer glasses too often.......grotty, to say the least.
159562015X|5.0|I purchased this book as a result of a recommendation from John Maxwell in his book [[ASIN:1400202566 My Dream Map]] which is a companion book to his [[ASIN:0785214127 Put Your Dream to the Test: 10 Questions that Will Help You See It and Seize It]]. I found the results of the test and the info in the book enormously valuable. I am one of many who are acutely aware of my short-comings, but not fully confident of where my strengths lie and as a result am facing huge frustrations and conflict in my career.   The results of the test were not entirely unexpected, but have given me a sense of confidence to now aggressively develop these areas and to focus on them rather than trying to strengthen or overcome my weaknesses.     A friend and I each purchased the book at the same time and compared our test results. The fascinating thing was that though we had 3 strengths in common, the description of those strengths were different for each of us. For me, this added huge credibility to the validity of these results. These results are 'uncannily' accurate, but then there are many years of research that has gone into this test.    In addition to my own personal benefits in knowing my own strengths, I have found that reading about the other strengths has enabled me to get a handle on a conflict situation I was struggling with at the office. I am now able to see the person's actions in light of his strengths and so gain a different perspective on what is happening, thereby adjusting my own attitude and enabling me to address the issue more objectively and constructively.    I cannot recommend this book highly enough - but do ensure that you get a new book or a book that has it's authorization number still sealed because the test is essential.

In the beginning, the work read like fiction - I couldn't believe it was true, but McDougall has that kind of ability as a story-teller. I devoured this book...and ended up going \\"barefoot\\" on many of my most recent runs. You'll want to go barefoot, too. As McDougall struggles through his 100-miler in the Copper Canyons, you'll be right there with him.
1594489505|4.0|A Thousand Splendid Suns.. a poignant topical novel covering early Afghanistan and the current Afghanistan.  In light of the current election it is a timely novel giving us an insight of the Taliban and the earlier rulers of this turbulent country.  It was enlightening and at times startling read reminding us of the plight of a country which has been at war for decades.  The innocent victims, those who are pawns in this war and who just want to live in their country at peace with themselves and those around them.
0553584537|3.0|ALONE is the third Gardner novel I've read, and while the author has a distinctive voice that runs through each story, the novels stand out in that they are completely different in plot and structure. GONE was a hunt to find a missing woman. SAY GOODBYE was a serial killer novel. ALONE is about a police sniper Bobby Dodge, and Catherine Gagnon, a woman who was kidnapped and molested as a child and now lives in an abusive marriage. Bobby and Catherine's lives are changed forever when Bobby is called to a domestic disturbance at Catherine's house, and kills her husband when it appeared that he turned a gun on Catherine and their son, Nathan.<br /><br />The novel alternates point of view between Bobby, Catherine and a killer just recently paroled. Bobby is being investigated for the shooting and Catherine is trying to pull her life together and fighting the charge that she's deliberately making her son sick.<br /><br />After just finishing Say Goodbye, I think ALONE is clearly an inferior novel. The thing is, it isn't because of Gardner. She wrote the story she wanted to tell. The story between Bobby and Catherine never reached out and grabbed me. There were never really any twists and the motives of the bad guys were obvious.<br /><br />It is apparent through three Gardner novels that abused children are a big issue of hers. Fans of Gardner should enjoy this book, suspense readers looking for a new author should enjoy Gardner, but don't start here. She's a talented author and each book I've read so far has been different. The story she chose to tell in this novel just wasn't very thrilling. I've already started reading HIDE, the sequel to ALONE, and it is so far much better. Gardner is just as good if not better than the other female thriller writers I've read like Slaughter, Hoag, Cornwell and Gerritsen.
B0009U7LN0|1.0|Unfortunatly when I ordered this movie I didn't realize it was in the umd for psp format. I have not been able to contact Amazon or the sendor to do an exchange or refund. It is a shame because it came very quickly. It was my error on the order but it would be nice to be able to resolve the problem. In the future I will be very careful ordering to make sure I get the correct format.
0307346617|3.0|For the most part, World War Z accurately describes a modern-day war on the undead. It enjoyably combines several viewpoints to create a mishmashed patchwork of vignettes and expositionatory descriptions of various people's experiences with the undead war. However, this is all tempered by one doozy of a flaw.       It is interesting to hear a character describe her experiences crash-landing in a zombie-infested bayou, and then, a chapter later, this character, now male, graces us with a riviting tale of fighting underground in Parisian catacombs. There is simply no difference in voice between the grizzled army captain and the former soccer mom, beyond a few fits of hyperbolic verbal tics. It's almost hilarious. You could easily take a paragraph spoken by the Otaku and shove it into the russian soldier's interview and you wouldn't notice anything different.     In short, it's an enjoyable book, and a must-have for anyone who pretends to be a zombie fan, but don't expect radically different viewpoints, or a riveting narrative. You'd only be disappointed.

B001OQCV9M|5.0|This movie is so cute (at least to me) that you want to pinch its cheeks and tell it how much it's grown. While most movies are based on one true story, here we get two.  Amy Adams plays Julie, a cubicle drone and cooking enthusiast, who has recently moved to a cramped apartment with her husband and cat.  (Unlike so many movie dwellings, the apartment actually looks believable; most movie people regardless of income seem to live in palatial penthouses.)  To give her life more direction, she decides to write a blog in which she'll detail her adventure cooking recipes from Julia Child's cookbook within a year's deadline.    Running parallel to her story is that of Julia Child (Meryl Streep) and her evolution as a famous cook and cookbook author; this takes place mostly in France in the fifties, but the transitions between the two stories are smooth. While Julie believes that her idol has always been poised and successful, the viewer sees that Julia's life had plenty of ups and downs - for instance, her cookbook went through several publishing houses and revisions before finding its place.    This one of the few movies I've seen lately that does not seem to be congratulating itself on how witty the dialogue is; nor does it try to cram in as many montages as possible, as shorthaand for character development. One warning: there are a lot of scrumptious closeups of the recipes, so bring extra jujubes.
0810979772|5.0|I took my friends children for their first time to the KCLS and they each recieved their own library card and bragged to their friends and family about them. They learned about responsibility in taken care of books, to make sure they returned them on time and even liked to order them as holds if not in stock at the library. They were 13 and 9 at the time and from a broken home.   When the now 11 year old found out that he really wanted his own copy of the Diary of a Wimpy Kid Do it yourself book, I was thrilled and bought it for him on your awesome site. Thank you for helping it be easier to get children interested in reading!
B000PY52EU|5.0|I will spare you the long paragraph and just say what is great about this movie.<br />\\"Christina Ricci a sex addict half naked in chains\\". Yes, this is what makes this film worth your time. Aside from the fact that Christina Ricci graces you with her amazing body and seductive ways for 115 minutes, Black Snake Moan actually has an interesting story. The movie itself is strange, and had the right actors for the parts. That is all except for Justin Timberlake, who has no business on any Cinema screen. He is a music performer, he should keep it that way. His parts almost de-rail the film as he doesn't look as if he belongs in the movie at all. With that said and out the way the rest of the movie is great. It's not A+ amazing, but Christina Ricci's character makes it all worth your while. Samuel L. Jackson plays another one of his oddball character rolls. This time he is a halfway crazy man (that's pretty good for a Samuel L. role) who wants to shed some light in the world. I'm not really sure what compelled him to out of no where decide to start helping Rae change her life. It seemed as though he was pretty off the wall and down on his own luck himself, then all of a sudden he is a religious warrior spreading good and cleansing the wicked. I think that transition is the only part of the movie that could have used more explaining. It made the things Samuel L. did seem akward because very little of the story was shed on what compelled him to save Rae, other than he found her on the road. With that aside it's hard to say anything bad about a plot that is focused around on a half naked Christina Ricci. Matter of fact suprisingly how easily this movie could of just been written off as ranchy, it never really crosses that line. It's actually about a caring man trying to help a young woman. Samuel L's character can only do but so much for Rae before he leaves it all up to her. Ironically in a movie that's so far from reality, it does have a sense of realism to it. **possible spoiler**Rae is never fully cured, but she now has the understanding of how she can ease and control her desires. That is the gift that Samuel L. gave to her. Overall Black Snake Moan was an interesting movie well worth checking out. It's not bad, it's not unbelievably amazing, it's just all out plain \\"good\\". and that makes it a 5 star film under my watch.<br /><br />PS. I was going to take a star away for Justing Timberlake being in the film, but Christina Ricci's rebel girl outfit brought it back.ble spoiler**Rae is never fully cured, but she now has the understanding of how she can ease and control her desires.

B000B5XOYI|3.0|For anyone who is a fan of the old Batman series this a good collection.  It contains bonus materials of all four movies that you cannot get when you purchase each movie individually.
0307454541|1.0|This novel includes considerable graphic violence, all the more disturbing that it is injected here and there in a rather classic whodunit framework. Overall, the plot is marked by extreme depravity and, in addition to a strong stomach, demands from the reader an unswerving effort in «suspension of disbelief».<br /><br />The story's Swedish setting unfortunately adds little to its interest as references to local culture and way of life are minor _ IKEA furniture for instance.<br /><br />In the audiobook version, the narrator is good but not outstanding.  For instance, his intonations for Lizbeth Salander are childish and out of character. Also, there is strangely no sound indication at the beginning or the end of a CD.  This of course creates significant confusion for the car-driving listener whose player automatically goes back without transition to the beginning of the CD after the last track.<br /><br />Sadly, this work did not live up to my expectations and I have no intention of moving on to the following two instalments.
B000ZEE3I6|4.0|This is the sixth installment of the Harry series, and by now, Harry has grown resigned to the fact that being the Chosen One might put a damper on your love life.  In the opening scene, it looks like he might get lucky, but then Dumbledore shows up with yet another mission.  This time it's to recruit Professor Slughorn (Jim Broadbent) to teach at Hogwarts.  The plot is the same essentially; as Voldemort tries once again to defeat Harry and fails. Throw in some Quidditch footage, wacky hormonal high jinks among the Hogwarts' student body, and some cool special effects, and there's your movie. Only Tom Felton as Draco has replaced Voldemort as the designated sneerer, which is good because he's a lot more photogenic.    As reviewers have noted, you won't understand the title's meaning unless you've also read the book.  It might not matter much now, but could require some more explanation in the next two movies.  Then and again, if you're just seeing it for entertainment and not because you care about the books, it shouldn't matter. If you are familiar with the books, though, you will probably be going, \\"Huh?\\" at a few scenes.
0060531053|5.0|If you love beer, buy this book. Period. It will make you want to brew your own beer.    I was handed a dog-eared copy of this from a master home brewer friend and after buying other books on the specific brewing esoterica, I still refer to this book for the basics. It is fun to read while being packed full of everything you need to be a self-sufficient brewer. It starts out basic, telling you what and why you are doing everything you are doing but eases into more advanced techniques alongside appropriate recipes. The writing style is in-line with how much fun making and drinking beer (preferably at the same time) is supposed to be. Also, this book is exceptionally well organized, so you will be going to back to it all the time. Best of all, it is appropriate for both the brewer who just wants to by extract malts, ready live yeast cultures and hop pellets to the the all-grain brewer who cultures their own yeast and grows their own hops.    If you are interested in home brewing and don't have a clue where to begin and are considering one of those all-in-one beer kits, dont't do it... find a local brew supply store and get this book. It makes it easy and affordable to get started.

B0014I4KH6|5.0|I haven't bought an album in years. Just nothing on the radio seemed worth buying to hear over and over again. Then I hear \\"Teardrops On My Guitar\\", and I'm hooked. I investigate a little more online, and find myself liking all of her songs, not just the singles on the radio. She writes and plays all of her songs! This artist has substance. I'm totally captivated by the music videos that are feature film-quality displaying her expressive acting skills. I've never heard such purity and honesty conveyed by a human voice. Finally, an artist who really deserves my money and support! Such intelligent lyrics, and clever turns of phrase, it's poetry of the highest order. And then putting music to the lyrics with great hooks and guitar solos, that's just musical talent. The lesser known songs are just as good, if not even better than the singles! \\"A Place In This World\\", \\"Cold As You\\", \\"The Outside\\" (written when she was 12yo!), \\"Tied Together With A Smile\\", \\"Invisible\\". \\"Tim McGraw\\",\\"Stay Beautiful\\" and \\"Mary's Song\\" just bring tears of joy to my eyes, they're such expressions of pure unselfish, love that they resemble benedictions in the form of songs. Even when she's angry: \\"Picture To Burn\\" and \\"Should've Said No\\", she's the voice of justice decrying bad behavior, selfishness, the lack of pure love; she's a force of nature you don't want to mess with. As other reviewers have noted, if these songs haven't made you fall in love with Taylor, just read the liner notes on the album. They'll bring more tears to your eyes. Taylor has a tendency to open up hearts that way. <3
1906694184|5.0|Lisbeth Salander is one of the most original and intriguing characters to appear in modern literature for a very long time. When was the last time you came across a featherweight female boxer with more than a touch of Asperger's syndrome; with strong kung-fu when it comes to computer hacking skills and an unstoppable fighting spirit when it comes to physical blows; with a photographic memory and an uncanny ability to grasp mathematics; a master of social engineering and a ghost of disguises; a formidable chess player and an enemy few people could afford to make?<br />It is Pipi Longstockings with breast implants, real guns and a killer PowerBook!<br /><br />Whereas the first installment of the MILLENNIUM Trilogy was more on publisher Mikael Blomkvist and his quest to solve a decades old locked-room/island mystery, this second book gives us a ample view on Lisbeth's history as she straggles to clear her name of a triple murder. She had both motive and opportunity and all physical evidence points to her. Was she desperate enough to actually have done it? What could possibly push her over the edge?<br /><br />Women trafficking, rogue agents of the Soviet GRU and the Swedish Sapo trying to keep their crimes in the shadows, biker gangs and obscure members of Lisbeth's family all interweave in a very absorbing story that kept me turning pages into the morning hours.<br />And amongst the fog of all this war, Lisbeth comes up with Fermat's alleged elegant solution to his Last Theorem on her own (no, unfortunately the solution is not described in detail).<br /><br />HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!

0743487583|2.0|\\"F***ing Frankenstein\\" is the way to go, by far! Don't take my word for it, take Jonathan L. Davis's word.<br /><br />In 1831, Mary Shelley created a monster when she published Frankenstein. Much like her protagonist, Victor Frankenstein, she did not know what havoc she would unleash with her creation, what social mores upended, what ideas rethought, what literary trends rebuked. A memorable lesson: when we finish creating our work, we become powerless; our creations have their own journeys of which we are no longer a part. Victor Frankenstein imbued life into something inanimate. He released a monster. And so too did Mary Shelley - with Frankenstein, a monster of literary endurance, living on for almost two centuries. But for how much longer?<br /><br />Enter writer Matt Allen. What Matt Allen has done here is revolutionary. He inserted the word \\"f***\\" and its gerund \\"f***ing\\" into the text. This is not sedition; this is galvanism. \\"Galvanism\\" is the term Victor Frankenstein used to describe his scientific method when reanimating life. Matt Allen - with the surgical precision of a cardiologist - galvanizes our interest in Mary Shelley's Frankenstein, breathing new life into its barely beating heart with the scalpel of the crude.<br /><br />To dismiss Allen's placement of profanity into the novel as \\"blasphemy\\" or \\"sacrilege\\" is to miss the point. In 1831, critics denounced Mary Shelley's Frankenstein as a \\"horrible and disgusting absurdity\\" (Quarterly Review). Frankenstein has a long history of subversion and what Matt Allen demonstrates here is a coy understanding of Frankenstein's true scholarly tradition. Much like Mary Shelley's subtextual warnings of the evil of the industrial revolution, Matt Allen, in his profane Frankenstein, exposes the same dangers of the information age. While old Manchester coal mines sooted up the streets with black and phlegm, digital media perverts the literary landscape with cut/paste and search/replace.<br /><br />Matt Allen may not be the last to put his learned fingerprints on a literary classic, but he may be our most canny academe. To read \\"F***ing Frankenstein\\" is to read the real Frankenstein - a modern Prometheus, as Mary Shelley so artfully describes. For what is Frankenstein if not immortal, shifting, complex? Would Mary Shelley approve of Matt Allen's version of her text? Does it matter? She created a monster.earned fingerprints on a literary classic, but he may be our most canny academe.

B001KVZ6FW|5.0|Irony: when Disney/Pixar produces one of their most complex and entertaining pictures to date and gives it the simplest possible title.<br /><br />Up is the lovely, touching story of Carl (Ed Asner)'s love for Ellie, and how loss can harden a person until the right friend comes along and breaks down those walls.  Carl and Ellie meet as kids, and they instantly bond over their shared love for famed explorer Charles F. Muntz (Christopher Plummer). They plan to someday travel to Paradise Falls in South Africa together, and, as time progresses, they end up falling in love.<br /><br />Carl and Ellie's dream takes a back seat, however, to the adult responsibilities that come with growing up, such as getting jobs and running a house. The couple tries to have children, but Ellie ultimately loses the baby - a scene that will have you weeping into your pillow within the first 10 minutes of the film. (The name &#34;Disney&#34; is usually synonymous with &#34;tear-jerker,&#34; but they outdo themselves here.)<br /><br />Seemingly unable to ever successfully have children together, Carl and Ellie are content to enjoy each other's company, always keeping their dream of visiting Paradise Falls in the rear-view. Though, of course, when they have finally saved up enough money to travel, Ellie succumbs to old age and passes away, leaving Carl to grow more bitter every day that he spends alone.  (Quite the dark backdrop to all of those colorful balloons, eh?)<br /><br />Despite being informed of construction plans that will affect his house, Carl refuses to move away, not wanting to leave the memento of his and Ellie's relationship behind. Just when you thought things couldn't get any sadder, an unfortunate accident involving Carl's mailbox lands Carl in court, where the court orders him to relocate to a retirement home. Carl, of course, will have none of that, and he spends that night attaching the now famous thousands of balloons to his house.  (Did you know that they animated each individual balloon string? Lord have mercy.)<br /><br />In the morning, Carl takes off, allowing the balloons to lift him and his house to Paradise Falls where he will live out the remainder of his golden years, free from human interaction. Unfortunately for Carl, his plan is abruptly cut short when Russell, a &#34;Wilderness Explorer&#34; who is just trying to earn his last badge (&#34;Assisting the Elderly&#34;), is trapped with Carl on the now-flying porch.  Can't really tell the kid to &#34;get off your lawn&#34; at that point, right?<br /><br />Along the way, Carl and Russell meet Kevin, a poorly named exotic bird, and Dug, the dog with the voice-translating collar who can &#34;speak&#34; his thoughts with the turn of a dial. Dug is the comic relief in the film, and you will be quoting &#34;Squirrel!&#34; for weeks after watching. Carl and Russell, of course, encounter  setbacks along the way (what happens when the balloons begin to pop?), though they do eventually meet up with Muntz in a &#34;you should never meet your heroes&#34; kind of situation.<br /><br />The vibrancy of the colors and the details that went into the animation here are positively breathtaking. The emotion of this film is stronger than in any other Pixar film that came before it. Carl's loss is palpable, and there's a moment near the end of the film that will fill you with as many happy tears as the sad ones you cried at the beginning.  Seriously.

B000IJ79UW|5.0|With the exception of George Reeves from the television series, no one has ever cleary defined a role as greatly as Christopher Reeve (for four films no less)! Until Burton's Batman film 11 years later and more recently The Dark Knight, there has never been an epic superhero film like this. It combines great talent (in front and behind the cameras), great story (with very subtle Biblical references) and amazing special effects. The only aspect of Reeve I don't like (and its probably because of the way the writers wanted) is the portrayal of Clark Kent. I don't like that he portrays him as a bumbling fool. As Superman, he's sincere and honest but the recent animated versions and Reeves' portrayed him as a reporter who can get story and not get intimidated by criminals as easily as these movies (including Returns). Margot Kidder is feisty as Lois Lane (and believeable too, not like Bosworth who looks like she's at the Daily Planet on an internship). Gene Hackman is both lethal and funny as Luthor, able to mix the cruelness of the villain along with the wittiness in his insults to his underlings. The flying sequences are brilliantly done (and continue to get better, until 4 (they liked to use the same shot over and over) and Returns (where almost everything looks CGI, even in the shots that really are Routh, he looks computer generated). The incomprable John Williams again delivers a rousing score. His main theme and the love theme are ones not to be missed.
1416550542|4.0|I felt the first few chapters of this book moved slowly- it took me several chapters to really get into the story.  I think this was in part due to the paradigm shift between Nell, Cassandra, and the other characters.  Once I got used to the rhythm of the book I became wrapped up in the mystery of Nell's origins, and started to enjoy the different viewpoints.  I think the author was particularly gifted at descriptions, I could really envision the different places and characters in my head.  I thoroughly enjoyed this novel.
B001S33D1G|1.0|I dislike horror and violence in children's books. I know children's fiction needs a problem or conflict to be resolved. But the seriousness of the problem and the power and wickedness of the antagonist must be tempered according to the age and maturity of the target reader.    The book Coraline is intended for readers aged 12 and up, but the level of scariness was uncomfortable even to me as an adult. Imagine Alice in Wonderland but creepier. Coraline goes through a previously always-locked door to a mirror world (Alice Through the Looking-Glass), where the \\"Other Mother\\" cooks better food, the toys are alive, and the books have pictures that \\"writhed and crawled.\\"    The Other Mother and Other Father have buttons for eyes, and they tell Coraline that she should stay and live with them. \\"'If you want to stay,' said her other father, 'there's only one little thing we'll have to do, so you can stay here for ever and always.' On a china plate on the kitchen table was a spool of black cotton, and a long silver needle, and, beside them, two large black buttons. \\"'It won't hurt,' said her other father.\\"    Note: there are several versions of this book. I read the 162-page original, not the graphic novel, or the movie tie-in edition. I do NOT want to see the movie!
B00008WT5E|4.0|Ask any AC/DC fanatic what their favorite album is, more than likely you'll hear Powerage. It's a very good album that was unfortunately left in the wake of several great ones (\\"Let There Be Rock\\", \\"If You Want Blood, You Got It\\", \\"Highway To Hell\\" and \\"Back In Black\\"). For that reason the album remains unfairly tagged as the group's Bon Scott era runt of the litter, inciting both praise and support from fans, including rock royalty Keith Richards.    Hearing Powerage for the first time feels like you've unearthed a rare gem. The album is the band's first truly accomplished work and serves as a bridge between their cult status and international fame. But it doesn't really kick in until the middle, featuring the killer combination of \\"Riff Raff\\", \\"Sin City\\" and \\"What's Next To The Moon\\". Which may explain its lack of popularity, or perhaps it's unfair status as below average - three towering songs that should have led off the album are bookended by several good ones.    But so what? Rogue screamer Bon Scott is in his excessive prime, the rhythm section featuring new bassist Cliff Williams and drummer Phil Rudd is a metronome disguised as a wrecking ball and the simple but bludgeoning guitar work by the Angus brothers is a profound study in rock `n' roll minimalism. Considering the overplay of so many AC/DC albums, it's nice to know you have a classic piece of the band that feels like your own.
0307245306|3.0|Ok. Rick Riordan is a genius and these books are as brilliantly written as the Harry Potter series, but here's the thing: THE NARRATOR RUINS THIS OTHERWISE EXTREMELY WELL-WRITTEN AND DELIGHTFULLY ENTERTAINING BOOK! I have read the entire series and I loved them so much that I decided to buy the audio versions to listen to as well. Luckily I only bought the first one to start with, because the narration is so awful that I couldn't make it through another one. Throughout the entire book he reads statements as if they were questions (think the band camp girl from the American Pie movies). For example this sentence: \\"Just then, my mom appeared and the teacher turned to greet her\\" would sound this way: \\"Just then? My mom appeared? And the teacher turned to greet her.\\" It is so annoying that it was impossible for me to enjoy the book. I checked the other audio versions in the series and they all seem to be narrated by Jesse Bernstein as well, so (sigh) I guess I'll just stick to the print. It's too bad because I really enjoy listening to books while I drive and I would have ordered every one of them if they had been well-narrated. Five stars for the actual book, but for the audio, a three-star review is very generous!
0375842209|4.0|'Death' narrates this novel, which I feel is a little gimmicky, and doesn't really add anything to the story. I also didn't like the little 'notes' that interrupted the story to tell you a detail about something else.  I felt they too were distracting.  i don't mean to start off negatively, but those were the two things that bothered me about this book.  Other than that- I thought the story was engaging, sad, and inspiring.
B000YXMMAE|5.0|Radiohead<br />In Rainbows; 2007<br />Self-Released<br /><br />My Rating: 100/100<br /><br />The Bible tells us that the rainbow is the sign of God's promise to never smite the earth with a world-wide flood again, a sign of perpetual joy and a hopeful tomorrow to all of mankind. With this, Radiohead became the type of band that one needs to thank God for in their prayers every night. While there aren't many signs of outright optimism in Radiohead's music, this is the record where the Oxford five re-discovered the joy of making music, something they may not have had since before \\"Creep.\\" When I speak of joy, I'm not referring to sunny feelings and corny sing-a-longs NECESSARILY (gotta give a shout out to the Wilco boyz here); it's more like a freedom of creativity, being unshackled from the past, hopeful about what tomorrow may bring. For this reason, IN RAINBOWS is a joyful and HIGHLY ENJOYABLE record. The band sounds at ease with the songs, which gives them an extra dimension (warmth?) that HAIL TO THIEF lacked, and it's really delightful to hear what they did with old tracks \\"Nude\\" and \\"Reckoner.\\" \\"15 Step\\" is the band's most energizing opener since \\"Airbag\\" (all due respect to \\"Everything In Its Right Place\\", which is more transporting than energizing), and with \\"Videotape\\", the band comes close to channeling the same dark muse that haunted \\"Street Spirit.\\" Elsewhere, \\"All I Need\\" and \\"House of Cards\\" are big highlights, and the album as a whole has that seamless flow that is crucial to a perfect record. United in concept, monumental in consequence (there's plenty to read about this elsewhere), holding together like a classic record should, IN RAINBOWS is the type of album that makes it great to be alive. (Weird, huh?)<br /><br />Cohesion (5/5)<br />Concept (5/5)<br />Consequence (5/5)<br />Consistency (5/5)<br /><br />Tracks:<br /><br />1. 15 Step (5/5)<br />2. Bodysnatchers (5/5)<br />3.

0553381687|5.0|George R.R. Martin writes epic fantasy with a depth and completeness of plot and universe that is rarely found. Time magazine aptly calls him \\"The American Tolkien.\\" In his first novel of A Song of Ice and Fire, Martin spins a tale that is fantasy in the way Dune is science fiction. His writing is magical with little magic, providing social implications and a complete society with characters, politics, and militaries that seem disturbingly real.<br /><br />Not for the faint of heart, A Games of Thrones begins an epic saga that is thick, somewhat heavy, but well worth reading. Whether one is looking for the politics inherent in his tale, the strong family stories, the romance, the action, the societies, or the overall plot A Game of Thrones weaves together numerous threads with a masterful story providing insight into a world as thoroughly developed as Middle Earth. Centering around families in the nobility, A Game of Thrones singles out the Stark family, led by a lord whose greatest strength and greatest weakness are his dedication to honor.<br /><br />Like Ned Stark, each character has sympathetic aspects as well as flaws, which leads readers on a wild emotional journey as Martin leaps between sides in every conflict, capturing the thoughts and actions of players in the game of thrones ranging from children to kings.
0345403959|5.0|I've been reading Eddings now for nearly 10 years and his \\"Garion\\" books are by far the best.  Truthfully, though, I wouldn't have been as big a fan if I had actually started with the first book.  I read Belgarath the Sorcerer first and fell in love with it.    Eddings' fantasy world, in my opinion, far outstrips any other series I've read simply because of the development he put into it.  Cultures, a complex history, a medieval society with a bit of modernism thrown in...  I get tired of barbaric worlds with \\"dangerous,\\" unsettled lands.  Eddings gives us actual countries with political complexities.
B001DUJNGS|2.0|I'll keep this short: Enigma could be a lot bigger than it is right now if Michael would just leave the singing to the girls, or at least find a decent male singer if he must absolutely have one.  He should just stick with what he does best, which is write great music...
B002BFBAWO|5.0|\\"Just My Life: The Making of Adventureland\\" takes a look at how this film came together. It was based on Mottola's actual experiences working at an amusement park on Long Island during the summer of 1985. He talks about the casting of Jesse Eisenberg and Kristen Stewart who, in turn, talk about their characters. The producers briefly mention how they were able to find a vintage amusement park. Also included is behind-the-scenes footage and clips from the film.<br /><br />There are three deleted scenes with optional commentary from writer/director Greg Mottola and actor Jesse Eisenberg. We get more of the theme park's managers played with killer comic timing by Bill Hader and Kristen Wiig. There is also an additional scene between James and Connell. Mottola puts this footage in context with the rest of the film and briefly explains why it was cut.<br /><br />Finally, there is an audio commentary with Mottola and Eisenberg. They banter back and forth with a lot of self-deprecating humor. Mottola says that he didn't want to make an \\"'80s kitsch-fest\\" and recounts some of his own experiences working at a theme park in his youth and how it informed the film. Eisenberg chimes in with the occasional comment and asks Mottola questions about the film. This is a very chatty track as they dish all sorts of trivia and filming anecdotes.
B000A2RRF4|5.0|This DVD is everything i was hoping it would be, The Jackson 5 was my 1st concert and then i saw the Bad concert and this dvd is just as mezmerizing I love seeing him live, there is nothing like it, There will never be another Michael In my lifet ime. I love the part when the girl was on stage and Michael kissed her and she just lost her mind and had to be carried off stage. All the people fainting, boys and girls crying, the dancing. For anyone out there who is not sure you need to have this in your collection. I am having a MJ party on his b-day 8/29 and i am showing this along with someother dvds i have of him. I think i am starting to get over his death its stll unbelivable but just think if we (his fans)feel like this just think how his famiy feels. The dvd is awesome just get it....Michael I love u forever I hope you are finally at peace. God Bless You
B0025UHKNS|5.0|The heart rate monitor is comfortable and works like a champ.  Also, the GPS syncs up quickly and maintained a track log on trails in heavily wooded areas.  The Garmin ANT program transfers with no problem and automatically uploads it to the Garmin website. Another unexpected plus is that I have Garmin Roadtrip installed with Citynav 2010 for my motorcycle GPS and the Garmin Training Center software found it and displays the track log on Citynav on my Mac as well, very cool.  So far, so good!
0060730552|5.0|Told in first person, this story of Joe's survival on an inhospitable mountain after breaking his leg, his determination to get off that beastly mountain, and his future decision to continue climbing - all are a source of great inspiration.<br /><br />Joe and Simon choose to climb in the wilderness of the Andes where there is no emergency help system (such as available in the Alps). They want to pitch themselves against this formidable mountain without any backups - just the two humans and the mountain. The mountain almost defeats them, but not quite - a little bit of luck even amidst the disastrous situations, and Joe's overwhelming determination to live, makes this survivor's tale extraordinary. The mountain, the crevasse, the snow storm, the dark nights of terror - all take on a life of their own, as if they are evil monsters playing with two puny humans, could crush them with a casual stroke of their paw.<br /><br />The adventure spans 7 days - the first 3 are about normal climbing and conquering the Siula Grande peak and starting the descent. The remaining 4 days are fraught with mishap, drama, emotional and physical endurance. The rescue effort by Simon happens as a matter of course, without deliberate discussions, exploration of all possibilities and consequences. At the point where Simon has to cut the rope the reader is completely in sync with him, knowing he has no choice.<br /><br />I liked the parts narrated in the first person of Simon (written by Joe - he acknowledges Simon's trust in allowing him to write those parts in his own words) - describing Simon's dilemma, guilt, and giving him a fair assessment for his role in the rescue. The emotional drama when Joe discovers his leg is broken, and the non-verbal exchange of thoughts between the two - is so totally honest and poignant. Joe comes across as someone with a deep understanding of human nature.<br /><br />Great book, I've read it twice over.
0307341550|4.0|After reading DARK PLACES by Gillian Flynn, I was very interested in reading her first book.    This one is a raw and strange book that takes the reader on a very bleak journey into the horrible mystery of trying to figure out who killed two little girls. Yet, for Camille Preaker, returning to her hometown becomes a slow descend into its clutches.    It's often chilling to watch as Camille falls deeper into the horrid darkness of her teens. I couldn't help wondering if she'd eventually get lost in it. She's not exactly a sympathetic narrator - her life is plagued with emotional instability, she carries physical scars she can't escape, and doesn't exactly make the best decisions. But that didn't matter because I was completely drawn into her world, wanting to follow her as Wind Gap engulfs her. All the time, shuddering at the strange events that lead her closer to figuring out who killed the girls and why.     So many times I wished she'd just jump into her car and leave that horrid small town and its many secrets behind.    Camille's connection with most of the characters is shallow because she doesn't allow herself to open up to anyone. She feels she's not good enough for anyone's attention. Her mother is beyond creepy, her cruel words and even worse actions sickened me. But helped me understand why Camille was so damaged. And her half-sister, Amma, is spooky.    Sharp Objects is a very creepy, haunting story about a woman with many personal problems - most of them stemming from her bizarre and loveless past. A childhood that still haunts her and sends her spiralling back into all of the painful memories of losing her younger sister. And just when you think the mystery has been solved, but realise it hasn't, the truth will shock you.     I enjoyed this book very much, no matter how uncomfortable it made me.
0316154687|3.0|While David Sedaris is still one of the premier essayists of this generation, his most recent book just didn't really do it for me, and I think he's in danger of kinda treading water a little bit. I mean, really, how many hilarious stories can he still have left to tell? I can remember reading 'Naked' and 'Me Talk Pretty...' and literally having to bite my tongue as tears streamed down my cheeks because I was laughing so hard (but laughing hysterically out loud for no apparent reason on the subway in New York tends to make people nervous!). This book, that didn't happen. There were a few funny stories, some good insightful moments, but I'm not sure that i'd pick up another Sedaris book. Might be time for him to try a new genre, he's a brilliant writer, but I'm just not sure how much of this kind of stuff he can keep pumping out. Still highly recommended, just start with 'Naked' or 'Me Talk Pretty...'
B001PPLJIQ|3.0|I found this movie great because it serves as a true reminder that both the good and the bad of others around us serves as a true teaching tool.  If others around us lie it becomes easier (via peer pressure) to lie as well and if others around us teach and share love it is easier for us to love.  2009 seems to be the year of WWII/Concentration camp movies.  In Tranzit, The Boy in the Striped Pyjamas, Valkyrie, and this one make 5 this year.  2007,2008 was the year of Afganistan, Iraq, Middle East, 9/11 related movies.  Passion leads to great movies and war movies WWII or 9/11 movies usually contain a lot of passion.  This one also serves as a great moral guide as well, enjoy The Reader if you have the chance to see it.  Kate Winslet is becoming a much better actress.  Not just pinning for Jack on the Titanic but she has so much more to offer!  This picture is just part of that so much more!
B002DKGWSE|4.0|After escaping police custody the prisoner (Garret Dillahunt) and his gang, brutally assault two young women (Sara Paxton and Martha Maclasaac from Superbad). They then seek a place to hide out and just happen to pick the summer house of the girl they raped and attempted to murder. Her parents (Tony Goldwyn and Monica Potter) are glad to help out the strangers, until they learn what happened that is.<br /><br />  Critics like Ben Lyons wet their pants over the violence but it's only the assault in the beginning that bothered me. The microwave scene also gets talked about a lot but I didn't find it to be as over the top as people have said. The movie is scary and  well acted. Goldwyn's performance never gets mentioned by the critics who bash the movie. That's because they wanna totally turn people off of seeing the movie, so they don't want to give the actors any credit. But Goldwyn was solid as the father. Dillahunt and Aaron Paul as the murderous brothers were also perfectly scary and creepy.<br /><br />  The direction was also very good for a movie that's considered one of the worse of the year by many. It is true that the movie could have been better if the violence wasn't over the top though. The objects that are used as weapons also didn't need to be introduced in the beginning as if they were side characters. Other than that this movie really wasn't awful like they claimed on At the Movies, they are just sissies lol. I could picture Ben Lyons even screaming and jumping on a table if he spotted a mouse. The movie was gripping and scary in the 2nd half. The assault in the first hour is hard to watch and sad though.
0307341569|5.0|I was intrigued by this book the first time I read the blurb. Not to mention that the cover certainly gives it that extra, dark look that totally captured my attention.    Libby Day is the only survivor after her brother massacred the rest of the family in the mid-eighties. As a result, after losing her mother and two sisters, Libby lived a hard life. In fact, her testimony of the events of that night is what led to her brother being locked up. Now that she's all grown up and the money is starting to fade to nothing, she becomes desperate enough to attend a meeting with a bunch of people who call themselves the Kill Club. Here, she meets people who believe her brother is innocent and hold her responsible for him being in jail.     At first, she doesn't want anything to do with them, but when they offer her money to start interviewing people that may know more than she does about that night, she accepts.    At the beginning, Libby seems like an unsympathetic character who blames what happened to her as a child for everything that is wrong in her solitary life. But as you get to know her and learn more about her story, you can't help but feel for her constant struggle to get out of bed every morning. It's easy to see why she turned out the way she did. Her honesty is raw and true. How can you not admire someone that strong, considering how weak she believes herself to be?  Her motivation starts out with her need for money, but after she visits her brother in jail for the first time, it turns into a search for the truth. She suddenly needs to find out what really happened that night as she attempts to piece together her own painful memories.     Cleverly interwoven with chapters that take you back to that day in the POV of teenage Ben and the desperate mother, Patty, the story unfolds slowly. So many unexpected layers start to appear as each of them moves along that day, while in the present Libby finds herself in a very horrible conclusion.     Dark Places is an amazing story, filled with mystery, raw emotion, and an honesty so brutal that it often makes you cringe. So much violence, lies, secrets, and misunderstandings lead to a dead family and a little girl who survives but never gets over the tragedy. Every character plays a pivotal role in what happened in that farm in 1985, and the end will shock you.     This is an edge-of-your seat read that you won't be able to put down until you know everything!
0307456625|4.0|When Precious Ramotswe hops in her tiny white van in search of clues to a mystery, she is not looking for bloody prints or a dead body. She is in search of truth... even if she has to lie to get it!<br /><br />Life in Botswana, South Africa is much different from life anywhere in America. Even though many of the characters seemingly live carefree lifestyles, there is much we can learn from the morality, wisdom, and humor that lace their mysteries. While the stories dealing with infidelity and lack of integrity are all too often familiar to us, Ramotswe usually offers a firm and peaceable resolution at a fair price.<br /><br />Though most of the characters are unrelated; the stories are unconnected, and some mysteries remain unresolved, THE NO. 1 LADIES' DETECTIVE AGENCY is an enjoyable, light-hearted read. The novel gives readers a comical look at some of life's serious issues and offers a ray of hope when it seems so far out of reach. Though he is an unofficial detective himself, Mr. J.L.B. Matekoni proves to be a ray of hope and helps Precious Ramotswe find her way to true love.

B001U0HBPG|5.0|This is defintely one of, if not the best movie of 2008. I saw it twice while I was in Boston in December of 2008. When I went to New York City in January of this year, I saw it again. Then I saw it two more times when I moved to New Orleans this summer. As you can tell, I really love the film.<br /><br />I have not read the short story by F. Scott Fitzgerald, but will look for it when I visit the library this weekend.<br /><br />I won't give any spoilers, but be prepared to cry and at times hold on to your seats in suspense. I recommend that you allot at least three hours of your time because the movie is quite long, however the plot is intense so the time will fly by fast.<br /><br />The main reason I have watched the film so many times is because of the intense love between Benjamin and his mother, but especially between Benjamin and Daisy. There is so much love in this movie that it really feels like real life and not a fictional tale.<br /><br />I plan on getting the movie posted framed and will hang it on my wall. Owning the movie is not enough for me. This will be a Thanksgiving family movie in my house for generations to come. Enjoy the film!

I spent several days grieving the loss of the spell and magic! There is now no more forbidden love and no more love triangle to get excited about. It's all gone!     When Bella was turned into a vampire, that did it! I thought it was a joke and that the author was going to make that part just a dream that Bella was having. Nope! She really did it! And, that STUPID name, \\"Renesmee\\" for Bella's baby. Please.     SO, IF YOU LIKED THE FIRST THREE BOOKS, STOP THERE! BREAKING DAWN WILL RUIN IT FOR YOU!

0143144456|5.0|This book grabbed me from the get go. Being an Oregonian myself, I caught on and understood all the little Oregon details the author put into this book. I really liked that aspect. It made me feel at home while listening to it.<br /><br />I instantly liked Mia and her family and could almost feel her confusion and pain during and after the accident that left her outside herself looking in.<br /><br />Gayle did a wonderful job with all of Mia's back stories she seems to lose herself in while all the doctors, nurses, surgery, hospital stuff is going on all around her. It really brought Mia to life for me hearing about her parents, grandparents, family, her childhood, Kim, Adam, & Julliard.<br /><br />I have to say at a few points this book nearly brought me to tears and I don't cry easily at all. I could feel Mia's desperation while trying to decide whether or not to stay. So heart breaking.<br /><br />As with all the audio books I listen too, the narrator really makes or breaks the book for me. Kirsten Potter was amazing and really brought this book to life for me.

0316017922|5.0|It is always interesting to see why people may become successful or develop a certain way, though of course no one can really say for sure.    In this book he looks at varius trends and somewhat luck of the draw (such as when you are born) to ascertain what leads to success.  The book is very easy to read and fascinating in the things that seem to affect someone.    Some of the things made sense to me, while others did not, but it was good in getting the points across in general and there was enough examples to really be able to entertain some of the things he was saying.    A definate must read for the writing itself and looking into an interesting aspect of how we become what we are, though the ones who really \\"make it\\" see the opportunities presented and use them which is the key - nt letting opportunity pass you by when it is presented.
B000005PRX|2.0|This was not the best Batman movie. The beginning was awesome. While I was watching the beginning, I thought that this was going to be an awesome movie. I was wrong. The ending made no sense. Batman ripped off his mask and exposed his true identity to Max Shrek. He intended to take Shrek to the cops and if he had, Shrek would've exposed his secret identity. If Batman had taken off his mask in front of only catwoman that wouldn't have been bad because she already knew who he was.   Batman would never take off his mask and expose himself and especially not to a criminal. This was ridiculous. As I was coming home after buying this movie, I had a feeling that Batman would lose his mask in it. But I had no idea that they'd be dumb enough to make him rip it off himself.   My best friend wanted to watch this movie very badly so I started showing it to him. Ten minutes later he told me to shut it off. This movie was very popular but I know of at least two people who were not crazy about it.
B0000TB01Y|1.0|After reading some of the reviews on here, I noticed a pattern.  Most of the reviews (especially those with 5 star ratings) were rating the SHOW, not the CD, but the show itself.  I thought that the purpose of these ratings was to rate the CD itself, but in review after review I saw comments like \\"I saw this show in NY, and the performances were fantastic...\\", \\"the set was amazing...\\", etc, etc.  I guess I fail to see what reviews about what people SAW and heard when they saw the show live have to do with their opinion of the CD, which in my opinion is about the MUSIC.    So, I'll admit, I haven't seen the show, but after the urging of my daughter who saw the show in NY, I gave it a listen.    Now, perhaps, not having the benefit of having seen the show, I was missing something, but I have to say that just based on listening to this CD and based purely on the music itself, this music is the most UNMEMORABLE, UN-SINGABLE, BORING, MUNDANE, EVERY SONG SOUNDS EXACTLY THE SAME, music I've ever heard in my life.  I actually found myself just waiting for the whole thing to be over, and trying to let my mind wander off on something else, so I wouldn't have to listen to it.    The lyrics were ridiculous and the writer was trying so hard to make them rhyme that most of the time they didn't even make sense. (\\"don't be offended by my frank analysis,  think of it as personality dialysis\\")    Many musicals leave you walking away humming the songs to yourself or the songs get stuck in your head for days - NOT WICKED.  I totally found myself unable to recall a single chorus or melody immediately after hearing them.  As one other reviewer pointed out - being able to simply sing your lines doesn't make it music.    The songs from many musicals leave you wanting to see the show itself (Cats, Phantom), but not Wicked.  Now that I've heard the music, I have absolutely no desire whatsoever to see the show.  Personally, I'd rather sit and watch paint dry, or go to the dentist and have a root canal.
B000AMJDHY|1.0|I swear every generic emo band like Fallout Boy, Taking Back Sunday, and the mighty awful Panic At The Disco must have the same singer cause If you hear them its the same voice. Now that I let that out of my chest this is by far one of the worst bands I had the displeasure of ever hearing, nothing about it is original, sadly enough when I was still in high school I was subjected to hearing this crap non-stop that I wished I pulled a Van Gogh on myself, this band has no redeeming value whatsoever, they are just a another generic band that copied an equally bad band called Fall-Out Boy who let's face it, only caters to adolescent girls, thank god this band ain't relevant anymore, do yourself a favor DO NOT LISTEN TO THIS GARBAGE, reading a book on car seat belts is more entertaining, looking at cement dry is more exciting, hell even watching grass grow is awe gasping than listening to this generic emo crap.

I am a professional designer (eLearning) and I recommend this book to everyone I know who is not a designer but is involved with the online learning at my company.

B001IUBZAU|2.0|Yes, I know what AC/DC brings to the table.  I have a number of their previous releases and when I saw 'new material' being delivered, I had to jump on board.    Should've waited.    Yes, the sound is there.  The guitar riffs, the drums beating, and so forth and so on.    However, nothing memorable on this disc.  No stand out songs.  Nothing that makes me want to pretend to sing along.  No comparisons could be drawn to their classic releases.    Even as I think about copying the disk to computer to be able to move them to iPod, etc., selecting any one song would be representative of the entire 15 track album.  The lyrics are unimaginative, the chorus repetitive and droning.    If you haven't reached into your pocket yet, you may want to hang on to your hard earned cash just a little longer.
B0021L8US0|4.0|(Spoilers)  District 9 is an enjoyable, sci-fi action movie about aliens on planet Earth. Typically these humans vs. aliens movies are the majority through the aliens being the bad guys. However, this movie is opposite of that. Humans are the bad guys and their target are aliens. Aliens land on earth malnourished and near death. They are \\"rescued\\" by humans but eventually displaced in Johannesburg, Africa. Essentially living as prisoners, refugees (whatever you want to call it). They are held in District 9. However, strong resentment of the aliens leads the public to once again call for the aliens to go elsewhere.  This story reminded a bit of the X-MEN comics in that humans hate the mutants (who are not evil and bent but nonetheless are targeted as such) and mutants have to fight for themselves against a lot of prejudice and hate.      Back to the movie, the aliens are evicted by their homes by MNU agent  Wikus Van De Merwe (Sharlto Copley).  Wikus is hard to describe. He's a corporate geek, a yes man, and he is part ass as he kicking this aliens \\"prawns\\" around like their nothing. Then Wikus is the victim of an alien fluid which transforms him into one of the aliens he realizes he must help them out as they are the only chance he has to be human.    District 9 strikes a lot of home runs for its original plot, the great acting, comedy, and ideas it presents on the screen. The aliens essentially if you want to break this movie down are all passing for human...in other words what happens to the aliens is indicative of how people often treat a group of people who are different. It's no wonder as well that this took place in Africa with its troubling history. The movies special effects are top notch. The documentary style used in the movie fits it perfectly.      The movie, however, by the second half after presenting so many complex issues decides to follow the direction of so many  alien movies before it turning into one giant shoot em contest with blood and guts with nothing thought provoking left.     Despite this though it's a good movie. It has everything you could want from the alien genre with the way it's presented and told. It does try to distinguish from the genre by posting to the audiences the themes of prejudice, apartheid, empathy, hate, and of course one's self-preservation no matter what they have brought on themselves or others have brought on them. With names like Peter Jackson involved it does deliver the goods.     This was Neill Blomkamp's remake of Alive in Joburg also worth your time watching.     Anyhow, I enjoyed District 9. I think you'll enjoy it too.
B0015HOFZI|5.0|Pros:  Line/Phono output control  Sounds good to a non-audiophile like me  Automatic play/stop  Puts everything back in place when side is done  Dust cover stays up nice and easy    Cons:  No repeat button  No forward/back cue button    In between:  Setup was a couple minutes work since the belt has to be attached. It's not difficult, just take your time with it.    EDIT: The record player will now sometimes start playing a record for a couple seconds, then send the arm back to rest. It is level so I'm not sure why it's doing it. There is no manual mode so it is very frustrating. I would get a record player with a manual setting.
1591841992|5.0|I almost did not buy this book after reading a few of the reviews. I am so glad that I bought this book.<br />It is not effective to just talk to people or clients; you have to engage them in other ways especially in the visual aspect. Even if you think you know everything about telling a story or conveying a message you can still learn more. This book will help you if you are a novice or an expert you will find something in here for you.<br /><br />Your challenge is to find something new that you can use for your business or you communication skills. Try to find something that is different than what you have every done. This will help you push your skills.<br /><br />If you work with a single person or a group this will help you gain some problem solving skills. You will also gain a different perspective on problem solving skills and becoming more effective at decision making skills.<br /><br />The book is written in a format that makes it so easy to learn and there is something to take away from every chapter.
B00260HH3K|1.0|I have only seen the trailer and opon seeing Goku and Vegata was sickened beyond words.  This animated series was great, but this movie spits on everything it sttod for, all people will think now when they hear dragonball is tird.
B0000C7PSW|1.0|Like many I first heard R Wainwright at the tail end of Shrek and was captivated by his rendition of alleluiah. I then saw him sing on a DVD tribute to Leonard Cohen which made me intent on finding out more about him. I bought Poses his first effort as young artist, and frankly it should have been labelled 'Poser' as it was quite an indulgent album but I thought, he was young, he has a marvellous gift in his voice and there is definitely musicality there that has to develop. I then bought Want 1 and 2 and to be frank I don't think anyone would want either if they listened to this repetitive and self indulgent nonsense. The only redeeming section so far is when his mate Antony comes onto the disk for a duet but I was greatly disappointed in these CD's overall. I will listen again on the basis that all noise has some redeeming qualities, but it is purely to see if I can salvage some value from my purchases. I think he is best at singing others songs and in his rendition of Cohens work #which of course shines in comparison# he is given the perfect vehicle for his voice. If you must buy this puerile nonsense then do yourself a favour and just download a track at random from either of these and see if you can stand listening to it more than once. Its a pity really as he comes from a great musical family, perhaps if he did a rendition of his Dad Loudons, 'Dead Skunk in the middle of the road' he might redeem himself in my eyes :)
B000MQC9H4|5.0|This DVD came new and there were no problems with it. I received the DVD quickly.
B00009RAJI|5.0|bought this last week and I'm glad I took the risk. the sound is great and i'm back to loving this album dearly like the first time i heard it years ago, considering the sound quality of the old version is pretty dirty as if caked with mud. the silver springs addition is not bad unlike what others say. i don't want to know and songbird probably enjoyed the best of the facelift because in the old CD they were merely \\"fillers\\" but here due to the sound improvement they contribute better on the album as a whole.<br /><br />however i think the second disc is unnecesary and so is the price.
B000ELJBAK|5.0|David Glimore - (1978) 9 Tracks *****  (48:46)<br /><br />The opening track, Mihalis is 5 minutes and 50 seconds of Pink Floyd-tinged Gilmoreisc instrumental heaven.  I'm really glad I recently \\"discovered\\" this album thanks to a fellow music fans recommendation (You know who you are :).  I was in junior high in 1978 and just beginning to buy music, plus I was way too busy listening to older Pink Floyd albums along with Aerosmith, Led Zeppelin, Rush, etc. too even notice this release.  I was mostly influenced by what the local rock radio station played and I don't think David's solo album got much exposure.  Then it was overshadowed by The Wall, which came out the very next year.<br /><br />I recently purchased both of Gilmore's solo records that Legacy remastered, especially since they were on sale at bargain prices!  Who could pass that up?  Since my purchase, I've given them both a few listens and I can say for sure that David's debut album is my favorite.  It's got some really cool, laid-back music on it with just enough of that distinctive Gilmoreisc guitar sound and his smooth baritone vocals to add up to some great stuff.<br /><br />You know how some people will complain that so and so band has become to \\"formulated\\" in their song writing or performance and that most of their songs sound too much alike (AC/DC, Nickelback).  Well, let me tell you, this album has plenty of diversity on it from the songwriting to the performance.  Sure David's guitar playing and vocals are distinctive, but he vary's his style of playing and delivery of his vocals just enough to keep it interesting and well balanced.  None of these songs are anything close to what he has written and performed with Pink Floyd.  Three of the tracks are instrumentals also.<br /><br />Finally, like another reviewer said (T. Wallace), this CD is Highly Recommended for Floyd fans who missed it the first time around (Me) or who have just been missing it.  This remaster sounds great too.
B000FL7CAK|5.0|I LOVE THIS SHOW!!  Now that I own it I watch it ALL the time, and I don't have to wait for the full season to be online :)
B001EIK7IC|5.0|At about 1:58 into the astonishing \\"Dancing Girl\\" (the opening nine-minute track of \\"What Color Is Love\\") it gets very quiet and the acoustic guitar holds the speakers alone - then Don Myrick's tasteful sax work floats in followed by keyboard flourishes and some wickedly arranged strings by Charles Stepney... The effect is absolutely magical...<br /><br />And after you've put your jaw back into place, you're left standing there with a genuine incomprehension... how has something this lovely and genuinely soulful been forgotten? Why isn't this huge??<br /><br />\\"What Color Is Love\\" was released on LP in March 1973 in the USA on Cadet CA 50019 and is the second of three albums Callier made for the Chess offshoot label Cadet in the Seventies - the first was \\"Occasional Rain\\" in 1972 (see separate review) and the third was \\"I Just Can't Help Myself\\" in 1975.<br /><br />Both \\"What Color...\\" and \\"Occasional Rain\\" are part of Universal's \\"ORIGINALS\\" series - Jazz, Soul, Fusion and Latin LPs reissued and remastered onto CD from a multitude of labels under the Universal umbrella. All use generic artwork (the originals name and band on the left of the sleeve as pictured above) and are gatefold card digipaks issued at mid-price. Although the card digipaks are aesthetically pleasing as mini-repro LP sleeves, unfortunately most come without booklets - this album's recording credits on the inner flap for instance are barely legible. Which is a bummer because if ever an album deserved fresh liner notes, history, photos, a new interview - but alas...<br /><br />The good news however is the beautiful remaster (40:44 minutes). The tape transfers for the whole series in general have been done in the late 2000's to superb standards by top engineers like Gavin Lurssen and Erick Labson - and in this case by KEVIN REEVES. So mellow, so lovely... a great job done.<br /><br /> As well as the wonderful breath of \\"Dancing Girl\\" (lyrics above) - highlights include the huge build up on Side One's closer \\"You Goin' To Miss Your Candyman\\" (co-written with Phyllis Braxton), the \\"I-must-hit-the-road but I wanna...\\" soft-soul of \\"I'd Rather Be With You\\" (co-written with Larry Wade and Jerry Butler) and the so 5th Dimension girly vocals of Kitty Haywood, Shirley Wahls and Vivian Harrell on \\"You Don't Care\\" - a song so up with hippy-love-and-harmony that it may have some of you going to work in a sunny disposition on the drizzliest of Monday mornings...<br /><br />PHIL UPCHURCH features on Guitar throughout, while another soul-hero associated with the album is CHARLES STEPNEY who arranged, conducted and produced the project to such sweet effect (also played keyboards). He was involved in The Rotary Connection with Minnie Riperton, produced four albums with The Dells and even twiddled the knobs on the iconic and now much-vaulted psych-blues-fusion album \\"Electric Mud\\" by Muddy Waters. I'd personally scour down anything he had a hand in - a genius...<br /><br />Like Marvin Gaye's \\"What's Going On\\", Donny Hathaway's \\"Extension Of A Man\\", Stevie Wonder's \\"Innervisions\\" and Callier's predecessor to this \\"Occasional Rain\\" - this is a proper soul album - a gem all the way through and still beautiful and inspiring to this day - some 30/40 years after the event. Why isn't the LP artwork of this masterpiece on someone's t-shirt somewhere as the ultimate street-cool - who knows? But you owe it to yourself to check it out.<br /><br />Of late Terry Callier has morphed (like Richie Havens) into a sort of elder statesman of soul still spreading his gospel of love and understanding - check out \\"Timepeace\\" from 1998 - unbelievably good and relevant to the now and not just past glories.<br /><br />I've warbled on a bit I know, but this album and its predecessor \\"Occasional Rain\\" both deserve it.<br /><br />Buy it, cherish it, enjoy it - and I envy you the journey...<br /><br />PS: For those interested in delving a little deeper - I've posted a full list of the 120+ titles in the\\"ORIGINALS\\" CD series in the 'Comment' section attached to this review (Oct 2009)
0061854549|5.0|Predictable Irrationality is the primary source book for a range of business books on behavioral economics now flooding bookstores.  Dan Ariely's readily accessible, insightful and interesting book is the grandfather of popular behavioral economics and highly recommended.<br /><br />The issue of economic behavior becomes critical given the emergence of new social technologies and customer driven processes making this a non-obvious business book to read.<br /><br />The book focuses on the fact that economic theory has largely been based on the notion of actors having full knowledge and making rational choices.  While the Internet may be increasing knowledge throughout the economy, Ariely's book shows that individually few of us make very rational choices.  That observation, backed by a series of innovative and surprisingly simple experiments makes the book a must read.<br /><br />This book is a foundational resource for the following books: Free (Chris Anderson), Buyology (Martin Lindstrom) and How We Decide (Jonah Leherer).  So if you liked these books, read this, as it's a primary source for all of these books.<br /><br />Strengths:<br /><br />* Ariely breaks the issue of irrationality down into easily digestible chunks focusing on the different types of decisions we need to make each day.  This makes the book much more actionable and understandable.<br /><br />* The experiments are well explained making it easy for a businessperson to identify similar decisions that they create for customers and execute internally.<br /><br />* The book illustrates and explains the rational behind things that we all know but always wondered about.<br /><br />Challenges<br /><br />* The book is long on explanation and exploration of irrationality but relatively short on prescriptions on how to address the issue.  Often Ariely's advice is to have people be more rational as a cure for their irrationality.  That makes sense but it is not particularly helpful.<br /><br />* The book crosses multiple disciplines: economics, psychology, education.  This makes for a wide audience and interesting reading, but it causes gaps for people looking for deeper insight.  This is not a business book, but it's a book that business people can take a lot away from.<br /><br />* The book has an underlying bias that because individual irrationality often leads them to make `wrong' decisions it is the responsibility of some other body (e.g.: Government) to protect people from making bad choices.  (Page 48)  That is a bit of a slippery slope from a public policy perspective related to personal responsibility, accountability, etc that the reader needs to keep in mind.<br /><br />Recommended for marketers who need to understand how they position their offerings and structure customer decisions.<br /><br />Recommended for executives who need to understand behavior in economics, particularly now that new technologies are engaging the individual customer behavior in new ways than ever before.<br /><br />Recommend for IT professionals as they need to incorporate behavior in the IT solutions they build, the behavior of their own people and the behavior in how they work with their business peers.<br /><br />Overall a great book, entertaining, insightful and it provides the foundation for much of the books that follow from it.

B0018LMZO4|5.0|This is the third album by Moody Blues, and it's clear they just kept getting better and better.  The history included in the cover booklet is great reading for any true Moody Blues fan.  My Vinyl copy of this album, 40 years old, just wore out.  Great that these digital versions are available.
B00005JPBL|5.0|Besides the fact that this movie rocks..isn't anybody gonna mention the Percy Saves The Day & Other Adventures movie cover? Either someone hacked Amazon, or someone at Amazon messed up big time.
B000BYA5GO|5.0|Absolutely love this movie.  Very enjoyable but MORE IMPORTANTLY it makes a real statement about GREED in this world. I love it when Producers can create an entertaining movie that is almost like watching a documentary. We know it is a fictional story but has a strong theme of truth behind it. Hopefully movies like this will encourage people to think and maybe actually influence voters in the US and other Democratic countries to pay attention to what our great world leaders are doing.
B002GY9F9K|5.0|I have not read the books but let me tell you that this is one of the best fantasy shows I've seen on television period... It has plenty of action, great camera work, and an awesome \\"intimate\\" relationship between the 2 main characters. Really keeps you wanting more. I can't wait for the second season...
0316017922|1.0|This book was the biggest waste of time reading-do not waste your money! This is only a bestseller because of prior great books by this author. It is like he is riding on the coat tails of his other books and assume everyone will buy this one just because he is the author. I made that mistake and I will not make that one again with this author. I am finished with his books. He put nothing into this book.
0743455967|3.0|Don't buy this book if you're offended by coarse language (but then, you wouldn't read anything by Stephen King if you are offended by coarse language).... The biographical information in the first part of the book is interesting, and there is a wealth of good information about writing techniques in the latter part of the book. Overall, a good read.
0307387178|5.0|This is an fascinating tale of a lonely traveller through the great wildernesses of America and even Mexico.  Chris McCandless was from a wealthy suburban home that rejected the modern style of life to live among the trees in Alaska.  He traveled with little in his pocket, but he had a lot in his mind.  Well educated, and quietly personable, he made his way in and out of people's lives.  In the end, he made a mistake which lead to the end of his life.  This is a wonderful story about getting in touch with nature and a simpler world.  Some people would think this man crazy, a nutcase, but I see his desire for adventure.  I believe most men enjoy testing themselves against the elements of nature.  In this increasingly civilized world, having the ability to live in the wild is an empowering virtue.  Shockingly, what is making me feel alive is going into the mountains and spending the night, waking up at 4:30am and packing up my gear and hiking up a hill.  No Chris McCandless was not crazy, he was a man.

B0021L8US0|5.0|Note: For those who have not seen the film, there are no \\"spoilers\\" in the review. The plot details I list have little to do with the focus of the story aside from providing exposition.<br /><br />\\"District 9\\" is one of those rare gems that immediately immerses you in its world. Beginning in medias res with stark images of a massive spacecraft hovering over Johannesburg, the audience quickly discovers it's been there for over thirty years by the time our story picks up. For months after the craft appeared the Earth waited for a response. When none came, the decision was made to send special teams to board the vessel and finally get some answers. What they got, instead, were more questions.<br /><br />The aliens inside were malnourished, unhealthy and their intelligence appeared to be below that of most humans. Labeled \\"prawns\\" due to their appearance, the aliens were removed from the ship and placed into a temporary encampment known as District 9, which has rapidly deteriorated into an outright slum. Enter Wikus van der Merwe, a seemingly naive yet likeable fellow employed with Multinational United (M.N.U.), the pseudo-U.N. organization tasked with handling the prawns. He's just received a promotion and is ordered to relocate the prawns to a newer camp set up in an area more isolated from humanity.<br /><br />While the scope of \\"District 9\\" seems initially epic, the film wisely follows a very focused tale centered on Wikus and a prawn known as Christopher. As the story unfolds, the development of these characters is outstanding - particularly for an action-oriented film. A lesser film would've transformed Wikus into a more compassionate person as the events transpired, perhaps even culiminating into some sort of freedom fighter for the prawns. With this film, however, we're finally presented with a very real, very flawed character.<br /><br />Even at his best, Wikus is a wholly self-serving individual and stands as a damning indictment of humanity as a whole. His most selfless act in the film is tempered by the fact that it's still in his best interests to do so. Christopher is, ironically, the most human character here and is unquestionably the most deserving of sympathy. Yet it's interesting to note how many still think Wikus is the true victim of it all. Watch how cunningly manipulative Wikus is when he's attempting to evict the prawns. His demeanor is slick and polished. He uses bribes, lies, and outright threats against them - not to mention the intimidating image of armed soldiers and armored vehicles surrounding the prawns.<br /><br />The documentary format in which the film is shot is a phenomenal aspect and one which is very original and innovative. Technically this technique has been used before, but it's typically in something like a Christopher Guest comedy and nothing substantially riveting aside from humor. Some have critiqued this film for dropping the documentary style mid-way through and becoming a more action-oriented film. However, had they paid closer attention, the reason for this is quite evident. It's made clear at the beginning of the film that the persons providing the commentary have no idea what happened to Wikus, or indeed what really happened in District 9. M.N.U. predictably covered it all up and only the audience is privy to what really occured. Their commentary mid-way through the film would've been precisely what it is at the end - mere conjecture and thus useless to the audience.<br /><br />Further, some have felt the film draws large plot elements from a myriad of other films such as [[ASIN:B000059HAC Enemy Mine]], [[ASIN:B000QQH4YS Robocop]], or [[ASIN:B000059HAD Alien Nation]]. This can hardly be a criticism, because \\"District 9\\" incorporates elements from these films in only the broadest sense possible. It's akin to declaring that [[ASIN:6305313687 American History X]] is influenced by [[ASIN:0783225857 To Kill a Mockingbird]] or [[ASIN:B00005JKTP Hart's War]] is influenced by [[ASIN:B0001GF2EM The Great Escape]]. While there may be a modicum of truth to this, the respective narratives are much too wildly divergent to be categorized in this manner. I can agree, however, that it seems very unlikely (even for a science fiction film) that the fuel/fluid could perform both the uses it does in the film. Still, this plot device provides an excellent catalyst for what transpires and is entirely forgiveable.<br /><br />I've read some critics believe the themes are a bit on the nose, and while I definitely concur that occasionally a subtle route is best, \\"District 9\\" is so thematically rich and the narrative is complex enough that this rings as a hollow criticism.  \\"District 9\\" is, on the surface, an action film. Yet this film has more to say about human nature than any film in years. If this weren't so, how else could a film about alien creatures on Earth feel so real?<br /><br />The polarizing opinions and wildly diverse interpretations of this film are precisely what writer/director Neill Blomkamp was aiming for.  It's been labeled as both a brilliant allegory of apartheid and of the Iraqi war, it's been accused of somehow being a 'racist' film, while others simply see it as violently offensive rubbish. Many watch \\"District 9\\" and cannot see the forest for the trees, they simply cannot see past the gore and violence to the core of the film.  Further, they want the film to provide answers and solutions, when the truth they're unable to face is that there are no viable solutions.<br /><br />These spirited debates, in a sense, mirror the ones in the film concerning the handling and treatment of the prawns. Ultimately, whether you like or dislike this film, it'll almost certainly have you talking about it for days afterwards. This can be credited to the fact that, once the smoke clears, there is a very real beating heart at the center of \\"District 9\\" (provided you're able to look beneath the surface). In the end, these are the true marks of a lasting, important film.<br /><br />* The text hereafter refers to the features included on the 2-Disc DVD of \\"District 9\\". As this assumes you've already seen this film, fair warning, there are spoilers below. The disc has two menu screens, one in an M.N.U. design and one in a prawn design, the difference between the two being entirely cosmetic. It's a nice touch to a fantastic home video release. The first disc contains three special features: a fine selection of deleted scenes, a making-of featurette, and a commentary track with director Neill Blomkamp. There are roughly twenty-three minutes of deleted scenes that shed a little more light on Blomkamp's vision. Almost all are little more than a minute each and a few have incomplete special effects (much like the ones from the recent \\"Star Trek\\" release). A handful are uninteresting filler, but the best ones range from a scientist explaining the reproductive habits of the prawns to one which depicts Wikus forcefully stealing the vehicle he drove to the M.N.U. headquarters. While I enjoyed the scenes immensely, I feel it was a wise decision not to offer an \\"extended\\" version of the film. The pacing of \\"District 9\\" is lighting quick without feeling rushed, something that the addition of these scenes would've ruined entirely.<br /><br />Next is a thirty-four minute making-of featurette which offers a generalized overview of how the film was conceived, shot, and edited. I'm not typically interested in this sort of thing, but a film like \\"District 9\\" is anything but typical itself, so I found this highly entertaining. It's precisely what one expects from a feature of this sort - plenty of interviews with the cast & crew along with some great behind the scenes footage. Watch for an amusing scene where Sharlto attempts to eat his lunch using his alien hand. Rounding out the first disc is a commentary track which is also excellent, well-stocked with Blomkamp's wealth of tales and comments about the genesis of the film. If he at times spends a bit too much time describing rather personal details, they still only serve to provide deeper insight into the film, especially considering Blomkamp was such an integral part of the film's creation. There are plenty of details covered here that aren't mentioned in the other features, though some of it could be considered a bit extraneous. (All of the above is also included on the single disc version.)<br /><br />The second disc contains four featurettes which in toto run approximately forty-five minutes. These are focused on a specific aspect of the film's production, as opposed to the more generalized feature on the first disc. The first is called \\"Metamorphosis\\" and highlights how the makeup crew gradually transformed Sharlto Copley's character from human to alien (if you liked seeing how the \\"Benjamin Button\\" crew transformed Brad Pitt, you'll love this one too). The second is \\"Conception and Design\\" which details the inspirations and ideas that led to the creation of the film. It's interesting to watch Blomkamp acknowledge previous sci-fi films that served as templates for the themes he wanted to flesh out with his own film, while simultaneously illustrating how brilliantly original the mechanics of \\"District 9\\" are. The piece begins with some great photos and information on how Weta Workshop created the unique alien weaponry. The third is \\"Alien Generation\\" which delves into the special effects work. This primarily focuses on the mechanics of creating the aliens and making them interact seamlessly with the human characters. The fourth is \\"Innovation\\" which details Blomkamp's approach to directing the actors in the film, along with how he felt improvisation was the key to making the film feel more organic. All of these features have tons of interviews and comments from the cast & crew (including Blomkamp & Copley).<br /><br />The Blu-Ray version includes all of the above as well as the ubiquitous digital copy and an exclusive feature called \\"Joburg from Above: Satellite and Schematics of the World of District 9\\". This is a unique feature which allows the user to explore sensitive locales on both the alien and M.N.U. sides with an interactive map. Also included are a couple of newish features popping up on all new Blu-Rays: the \\"CineChat\\" feature, which allows users to chat with friends while watching movies; and \\"MovieIQ\\" which provides a large database of technical information about the film. For those who are interested in this sort of thing, there's also a demo for a video game called \\"God of War III\\" for the Playstation 3 which includes a making-of clip once the demo is completed. I don't own a PS3 so I can't comment on the quality of this feature. A final note: the one feature that many hoped would be included is absent on all versions, which is the original \\"Alive in Joburg\\" short that inspired the film. However, the short can easily be located and viewed online.he 2-Disc DVD of \\"District 9\\". As this assumes you've already seen this film, fair warning, there are spoilers below.

A handful are uninteresting filler, but the best ones range from a scientist explaining the reproductive habits of the prawns to one which depicts Wikus forcefully stealing the vehicle he drove to the M.N.U. headquarters. While I enjoyed the scenes immensely, I feel it was a wise decision not to offer an \\"extended\\" version of the film. The pacing of \\"District 9\\" is lighting quick without feeling rushed, something that the addition of these scenes would've ruined entirely.     Next is a thirty-four minute making-of featurette which offers a generalized overview of how the film was conceived, shot, and edited. I'm not typically interested in this sort of thing, but a film like \\"District 9\\" is anything but typical itself, so I found this highly entertaining. It's precisely what one expects from a feature of this sort - plenty of interviews with the cast & crew along with some great behind the scenes footage. Watch for an amusing scene where Sharlto attempts to eat his lunch using his alien hand. Rounding out the first disc is a commentary track which is also excellent, well-stocked with Blomkamp's wealth of tales and comments about the genesis of the film. If he at times spends a bit too much time describing rather personal details, they still only serve toprovide deeper insight into the film, especially considering Blomkamp was such an integral part of the film's creation. There are plenty of details covered here that aren't mentioned in the other features, though some of it could be considered a bit extraneous. (All of the above is also included on the single disc version.)    The second disc contains four featurettes which in toto run approximately forty-five minutes. These are focused on a specific aspect of the film's production, as opposed to the more generalized feature on the first disc. The first is called \\"Metamorphosis\\" and highlights how the makeup crew gradually transformed Sharlto Copley's character from human to alien (if you liked seeing how the \\"Benjamin Button\\" crew transformed Brad Pitt, you'll love this one too). The second is \\"Conception and Design\\" which details the inspirations and ideas that led to the creation of the film. It's interesting to watch Blomkamp acknowledge previous sci-fi films that served as templates for the themes he wanted to flesh out with his own film, while simultaneously illustrating how brilliantly original the mechanics of \\"District 9\\" are. The piece begins with some great photos and information on how Weta Workshop created the unique alien weaponry. The third is \\"Alien Generation\\" which delves into the special effects work. This primarily focuses on the mechanics of creating the aliens and making them interact seamlessly with the human characters. The fourth is \\"Innovation\\" which details Blomkamp's approach to directing the actors in the film, along with how he felt improvisation was the key to making the film feel more organic. All of these features have tons of interviews and comments from the cast & crew (including Blomkamp & Copley).    The Blu-Ray version includes all of the above as well as the ubiquitous digital copy and an exclusive feature called \\"Joburg from Above: Satellite and Schematics of the World of District 9\\". This is a unique feature which allows theuser to explore sensitive locales on both the alien and M.N.U. sides with an interactive map. Also included are a couple of newish features popping up on all new Blu-Rays: the \\"CineChat\\" feature, which allows users to chat with friends while watching movies; and \\"MovieIQ\\" which provides a large database of technical information about the film. For those who are interested in this sort of thing, there's also a demo for a video game called \\"God of War III\\" for the Playstation 3 which includes a making-of clip once the demo is completed. I don't own a PS3 so I can't comment on the quality of this feature. A final note: the one feature that many hoped would be included is absent on all versions, which is the original \\"Alive in Joburg\\" short that inspired the film. However, the short can easily be located and viewed online.
B0025X4P24|5.0|Thanks Vanessa for this classy record, for sharing your talent and elegant voice with all of us. without any doubt the album of the year.
B0001AVZA8|5.0|This is a great dating movie for those of us over 50 years of age............how true it depicts the difference between men and women after a breakup - men date younger women and women cry for days........been there and done that and probably most women can totally relate.  Kianu Reeves is the sexy, nice younger man who loves older women and how true that is and I know first hand as I am in the dating world.  I love Jack Nicholson and again the cast was great.  Makes you laugh and cry and I love happy endings.
B00026WU9Q|5.0|Like most Dylan fans, I find it hard to pick a favourite among the three masterpieces Dylan recorded in the mid-60s.  To be fair, Highway 61, Blonde on Blonde and Bringing it all Back Home can all lay claim to being Dylan's finest release.  My special fondness for Bringing it all Back Home likely has to do with the fact that it was the breakthrough to Dylan's electric period coupled with the fact that the album (the first in the series) is something of a hybrid, boasting both electric and acoustic tracks.     By this point in his career, Dylan's song-writing had taken a decisive turn away from the overtly political offerings of his third album: The Times They Are A'Changing.  The follow-up to that album, the transitional Another Side of Bob Dylan contains at least two tracks (It Ain't Me Babe & My Back Pages) in which Dylan all but renounces his role as spokesman of his generation.  That delightfully quirky album, however, in no way prepared Dylan's fan for the album that shortly followed.    In its original LP form, Bringing it all Back Home was divided between an acoustic side two and an electric side one.  It was, of course, the electric side that came as the surprise, gaining Dylan new fans even as it lost Dylan some of his loyal folk-music-following.  Call the music on that first side rock, call it folk-rock, call it electric folk: call it what you please, but none of Dylan's previous work could have led anyone to anticipate the sheer power of \\"Subterranean Homesick Blues\\" and that of many of the tunes that follow.  (Personal favourites include the well-known \\"Maggie's Farm\\", the boisterously funny \\"Bob Dylan's 115th Dream\\", and the hauntingly beautiful ballad, \\"She Belongs to Me\\").     And yet, to this listener's ears, the album's true highlights are found on its second side.  Perhaps as a result of his experiments with electrified music, perhaps as a result of his rejection of straightforward \\"message\\" songs, Dylan's writing seems to have taken a leap forward, with the four selections on the original side two of this album representing the richest fruit of that forward leap.  \\"Baby Blue,\\" \\"Tambourine Man,\\" \\"Gates of Eden\\" and perhaps especially \\"It's Alright Ma\\" represent the young Dylan at his most hauntingly lyrical and musically rich.      It's the juxtaposition of the electric and acoustic Dylan that will always lead me to hold Bringing it all Back Home in especially high esteem.  That's why I regard this album as a terrific starting point for those who only know Dylan through one or more of the Greatest Hit packages that have been released over the years.  For anyone wanting to take their next step in becoming acquainted with the work of this wonderful American artist, look no further: Bringing it all Back Home is a wonderful place to begin.
B000002H6C|5.0|harvester of sorrow is hands down the best and most hardcore song on the album. dont understand all the hype over \\"one\\", worst song on the album IMHO, along with \\"dyers eve\\"...i dunno lyrics sound kinda like a green day song. everything else on the album kicks ass
B00004RF97|5.0|This is an old movie well worth seeing.  It is touching and hilarious.  What a combination of brilliant actors and actresses, too!  The chemistry between all of them is incredible.  For an old movie fan, this movie is very special.  I think it is worth having a copy of your own.  There are things in it that resonate now, especially the relationships between women and men, even if the ideas in it and some scenes seem unreal.  That is not a drawback at all to enjoying it.  In fact, it might appeal to you that it is a bit unrealistic and \\"dreamy,\\" so to speak.  This movie is also thought provoking and will not be forgotten.
B0026RHR6K|3.0|I think the cases were not designed very well. It's a big pain to take dvds out or put them back in. The worst part is that it didn't seem to come with any kind of episode guide, so you don't which episodes or special features are on which disc. Although, I must say, I enjoy the little centurion action figure.
B0000028M7|4.0|I used to have this album. I didn't quite find it as heavy as \\"Facelift\\" was, but it still had the muddy grunge sound to it. I came to this conclusion after hearing \\"Them Bones\\", and from there it just kept at an even keel. Some of the highlights are: \\"Down In The Hole\\", \\"Junkhead\\", \\"Would\\" and \\"Angry Chair\\". The song \\"Rooster\\" is a person tribute to Jerry Cantrell's father who was a Vietnam Vet, and apparently had the nickname \\"Rooster\\". I want to acknowledge this first before I say it was the worst song on this album. I don't really go for depressing songs, and this one is depressing. I feel that this one put Alice In Chains on the map as their next release \\"A Jar Full Of Flies\\" would go to number 1. With \\"Dirt\\" it sounds like what Corrosion Of Conformity's 1994 album would sound like, and it has Sabbath riffs reeking all over it, so you get the best of both worlds.
1401322336|5.0|This is really a great cooking book.  Jamie Oliver is a great, fun, and creative chef, and this book really brings across his spirit.     He prefaces this book by saying it should have been his first.  I feel like this book could be the one cook/kitchen book you could own and you'd be mostly content.  He gives advice on everything - what appliances, pots, pans, knives, etc. to have in your kitchen, how to pick out good ingredients, and even breaks down little details about types of meat or lettuce that really lay a foundation for success in the kitchen. Each chapter starts with an introduction on what you should know about that type of food (salads, soups, meats, etc.), common mistakes in purchasing, storage, and preparation, and useful tips we should all be born knowing!     Once or twice I had to hop online to look up what one thing meant, for example his photo of different types of lettuce, they're not each labeled but are all described in the adjacent page and I wasn't sure which description went with which bunch of greens.  Not a big deal, though.     The recipes are great too.  Jaime Oliver is into simplicity, balance, and flavor.  He's a very creative chef and each recipe really emphasizes bringing the most out of each ingredient - flavor, texture, and even color.      I found it really cheap here on Amazon, so I can't think of any reasons NOT to own this book.  Hope this review helps!
B001QTXM5Y|2.0|I know the fans of the Watchman series of illustrated novels appreciated the movie.  I am not familiar with the series but excited to watch the movie version.  Well I was disappointed.  The movie seemed to rely too much on prior story lines that so often I had no idea why characters were acting the way they did.  I am not a prude but the romantic scenes were more distracting than helpful to advancing the movie.  I felt the parts mostly came together at the end but I felt underwhelmed.  Sure I could watch it again and get a lot more out of it, but frankly I don't want to bother - it just isn't worth it for the rest of us.
B001GZ6QEC|5.0|I don't suppose there's much I can add to reviews of the movie itself.     The extra disc that discusses the making of the film really was amazing.  It wasn't any of this \\"look into the special effects\\" or \\"get to know the actors a little better\\" stuff, but rather the making of the story itself.     I was in medical school on my psychiatry rotation when I received this movie and found the psychiatry presented by professionals who helped create Batman and the villains amazingly useful.  I even went to work and discussed it with the psychiatrists.     In Batman Begins, the flooding training Bruce Wayne uses to overcome his fear of bats really struck me (it's a real psychiatric exercise).  For this film they explain how they took parts of various real serial killers and incorporated them into the psyche of the various villains, the worst being the Joker.  If you've ever studied antisocial behavior and personality disorders, you'll appreciate how much work went into this film and the acting that made it happen.      It gave me a whole new perspective and appreciation for this film and I watch it all the time on my big screen TV even though it's so long.  I get totally into it every time!
0425166805|1.0|The entire book can be exemplified in the single sentance quoted below:    \\"If we accept the formula of this brain trust, civilizations with more advanced technologies than ours may have existed hundreds of thousands of years ago-a fact that supports the theory put forward here of visits by \\"gods\\" from the cosmos in the dawn of time.\\"    The 'formula' referred to is described as an equation of the probability of intellegent life on planets in our galaxy as determined by a meeting of astromomers to 'question the existence of extraterrestrial intelligences'.  Such a formula can only be derived by sheer assumption using totally arbitrary mathematical ratios, since we obviously know of no other planet with ANY form of life, other than Earth. We simply have no basis to make an intelligent assumption on what the ratios should be.  Yet, von Daniken in the very same sentance goes from siting  this \\"formula\\" to assuming that some of these 'formulated' extraterrestrial civilizations MAY be older than ours, and caps it off by calling his possibility a \\"FACT\\" that proves we were visited by ancient aliens.  Practically every page of the book is filled with these leaps of turning a 'supposition' into a 'fact'.      Again, a great read, terrible science.
0743455967|5.0|It was fun to read this author in a non-fiction setting. He uses his sense of humor and expertise to share with us the basics of the writing world. I have read many books, but this one made me laugh out loud. This man is brilliant, funny and so clever. I would love to read more about him. He definitely has a writing style that crosses easily from fiction to non-fiction. He explains the writing world in a clear way that I was able to grasp easily. This book inspired me. According to Stephen, we write because we have to. It is who we are, not what we do. If you want to learn how to write, it is best to consult the master storyteller. Are you serious about writing? If so, why not let Stephen King teach you how to make your dreams a reality. Get this book today!
B001UGIRF8|5.0|The perfect package for the Gabriel era Genesis fan. For my taste, these are the only five Genesis albums I would want anyways, so this collection caught my eye. Add in that I had none of these on vinyl....perfect.    Nick Davis remixed these in 2008. You can read about all the details; half speed mastering, 180 gram vinyl, slick packaging, etc. It's all true. But, the real question....how do they sound/feel?     I can't stop listening to these! They sound and feel amazing. The feel of the analog bass pedals on Get 'Em out by Friday, the mellotron on The Fountain of Salmacis...outstanding!    It really makes sense to have this stuff on vinyl. It was conceived, recorded, mixed, and produced in an analog world. This is how it should be played. To quote the great Marty Scorsese, PLAY IT LOUD!!
0823015033|5.0|The author has done a wonderful job conveying techniques and tips for modeling realistic figures in clay.<br /><br />The book begins with the techniques that are fundamental to all shapes.<br /><br />It them moves into a wonderful chapter on  how to make your own tools for the rest of the projects in the book. This chapter alone is worth the price of the book.<br /><br />The author then takes you step by step in modeling a life-like figure. Using a simple to understand measuring system, you learn how to make every body part proportional to achieve realism.<br /><br />You will learn techniques in modeling and shaping clay, baking, sanding, polishing, painting, finishing, making realistic-looking hair, even how to make beautiful clothes and accessories.<br /><br />The book is well thought out and very easy read with plenty of diagrams and photographs.<br /><br />I've already learned techniques that apply to other types of clay modeling as well. This is a book I will use for years as a reference. I highly recommend this book to anyone seeking a solid learning experience in sculpting with clay.
B001KVZ6F2|5.0|Warning: Contains minor spoilers.    I finally saw Gran Torino six months after it didn't win Academy awards.  After waiting for so long I figured it couldn't possibly live up to the hype.  Anticipating some anticlimactic, less ethnic Boondock Saints, I resigned myself to catch up with Clint Eastwood's revered vision.  Despite myself, I became totally absorbed.  The film was ethnic, religious, and more interesting than I'd even heard.    Archetypes in film are usually boring.  I can't stand it when a movie is full of flat, one-dimensional characters doing exactly what the viewer expects them to do.  At first I was distracted by the number of one-dimensional characters in Gran Torino.  Set in a ghetto at the edge of a Ford factory town, it's a perfect illustration of ethnic and temporal clash to characterize America's history.    Perhaps the setting is even more perfect now, with Bud falling to inBev and GM falling to Congress.  In the very first scene the main character buries his wife.  A laughably archetypical young, Irish priest drones about life and death while Clint Eastwood rolls his eyes heavenward, his estranged family unsurprisingly irreverent.    All the elements are there.  It's so expected it's annoying.  Ethnic stereotype. Check.  Industrious old man irritated that his young family doesn't get it.  Check.  It's about family, it's about America, it's about the working class in fringe neighborhoods that have always made this country strong.  Eastwood plays Walt Kowalski, a \\"Polack\\" who would've been among the first wave of Ford-strong workers.  See also his hair dresser, a machismo Italian Kowalski accuses of being \\"half-Jew\\" when he charges a wopping (ahem) $[...] for his monthly haircut belongs to that same storied first generation.    Every element in this movie is one-dimensional, and yet . . . it's perfect.  Eastwood's character rejects the Irish priest, charged by his late wife with the task of \\"taking special care of this sheep\\" in his \\"flock\\" of parishioners, when the priest begins hounding him to confess.  When pressed, Kowalsk shares a beer with the priest, wet behind the ears next to Eastwood's hard-lined complexion.  He explains that the \\"overeducated, 27-year-old virgin who likes to hold superstitious old women's hands and make promises he can't keep\\" knows nothing about life and death.  Kowalski spent three years killing (even, we later learn, when not so ordered) in Korea.  He calls the priest \\"Padre,\\" rather than the deferential, traditional \\"Father.\\"    Only later, after a few ethnic in's and out's, does Kowalski accept a religious touch.  Evidently it's not that he rejects religion; he only needs a father figure, as do we all, to provide spiritual guidance.  A Hmong shaman \\"reads\\" him (predictably) exactly right.  Kowalski is stunned, coughs up blood, shares solace and rice alcohol with a member of that family, and his fatherly bond is sealed.    Gran Torino is not about the characters.  Each player is only a vehicle for Eastwood's point.  Indeed, while the characters are flat, the acting is rather good.  The youngest Hmong cousin, haunted by a family gang and first exposed to Kowalski when he tried to steal the title car, is young and weak (Kowalski later calls him a \\"puss-bag\\") at first.  He's smart but unfocused--the ghetto offers little in the way of goals.  We pretty clearly see the kid grow under Kowalski's influence.  The former soldier teaches \\"Toad\\" to paint a house, hammer a roof, tend to a garden.  He takes him to see the barber and teaches him to \\"talk like a man\\" (NB: the barber is reading a 1935-style porn when the boys walk in, with women stretched out like the silhouettes on truck mudflaps).  Kowalski rags on Toad to date a beautiful Hmong girl (\\"Yum Yum\\") who keeps giving him the eye.    In short, Kowalski imparts self respect through productive actions.  He's kind of a Hank Hill (from King of the Hill) in the gratuitously-stereotypical neighborhood.  He finds himself, like a serendipitous vigilante, in a position to save the Hmong Su from a black gang.  Su sasses the thugs for calling her a \\"bitch and a ho in the same sentence--way to be a stereotype.\\"  Kowalski finds himself a role model for a huge Asian ethnic group with historically weak male role models (\\"girls go to school; boys go to jail\\"), and a savior where no one else can stop the intrafamiliar gangs that seem to pervade the ghetto.    The ending is somewhat suprising.  We know that Kowalski faces painful treatments for the rest of his life to eradicate whatever evil caused the thick blood in his cough.  He finally confesses, spilling three sins that tarnish the very soul of a man with integrity, but elicit only a \\"that's it?\\" from the ghetto priest.  He buys a suit, retools his will, and has long-since accepted that his \\"family\\" are the Hmong he respects, not the second-generation Toyota-drivers (predictably) pushing Dad to a home.  What's surprising isn't that he dies, but that the ending preserves the flat, illustrative essence of each character while managing to weave them perfectly in as coherent a finish as the rest of the film.    The movie isn't surprising, but it's still beautiful.  We have lost so much of the integrity once the heart of the American dream.  Those  of us who wail about politics cite anecdotal evidence so far removed from personal experience that we might as well be opining on the European Union.*  I loved this film for taking one-dimensional archetypes easy to understand and weave a story around them that's faceted, intelligent, more profoundly true than merely political, and . . . perfect.    Where Boondock Saints made me want to go vigilante on gangsters' asses, this movie made me want to tend to the margins.  I wanted to go home and fold clothes haphazardly tucked into the drawer.  I wanted to wash my car, care for my things, perhaps consider a victory garden.  I wanted to drop the multi-dimensional pretexts that detract from integrity and simply do things right.    This movie reminded me that the American Dream with which I'm so obsessed isn't about making it big (though it's about that too), but rather about making it.  It's only the sum total of tucked hospital corners, waxed hubcaps, crossed t's and dotted i's that make a college education, a marriage (save Kowalski's indiscretion in 1968 with Betty Jablonski at a company Christmas party), and a life.    So in the end the movie is--predictably!--about life and death.  All the usual elements are there: religion, intrigue, ethnic warfare and paternal protection.  Kowalski finds purpose in his last months, and, after a life well-lived, finally finds something for which he's ready to die.  Nothing about this film is particularly surprising.  But the skill behind weaving these flat elements is impeccable.  There are worse things than living with purpose and integrity, and in the end finding the story to be perfect.
0753810204|3.0|I purchased this book because it was advertised as being readable even by a layperson (someone not particular scientifically literate).  My impression after reading the book is that you will not get much out of it unless you have a strong scientific background.  I would like to hear from others who disagree with my assessment.
B001GM28HO|3.0|Lady Gaga (what kind of name is that?!) has a decent voice but really this is just party dance-pop music. Poker Face has so much going for it musically, but the rap portion should have been left out; in this song, the rap just seems out of place, and with lyrics like 'bluffin with my muffin' takes the song down to a level that is more dirty than clever. I wish that Lady Gaga's lyrics did not have so many innuendos, as the CD is really inappropriate for teen girls who like to listen to her songs.

0307269981|5.0|You MUST read Larsson's previous novel \\"The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo\\" FIRST.  The Girl Who Played With Fire is the sequel. I read many, many books a year and these two suspense novels are in my ALLTIME top ten!  It is a shame that Larsson passed away at such an early age.  I can't put into words how strongly I recommend these two books!
0394721772|5.0|Along with Vol. 1, Mastering the Art of French Cooking Vol. 2 was my inspiration and my guide when I was a young cook.   Recently seeing \\"Julie and Julia\\" brought back floods of memories of those hours immersed in Julia Child's directions, and the resulting absolutely glorious eating. I embarrassed my dear love -- who wasn't with me during those early culinary adventures -- by moaning and sighing over the food shown in the movie; that movie is like porno for foodies. When we got home, he extracted a promise that I would cook Julia's Boeuf Bourguignon (Vol. 1, on my very splattered page 315) within two weeks.    I'm hoping that the movie will send a new generation of cooks to explore this exquisite cuisine. There will be the concern about all that butter, but oddly, when I was cooking and eating a lot of Julia Child butter-drenched recipes I was at my thinnest, and my cholesterol was low.   We were in Paris for three days a little over a month ago, and the only overweight people I saw seemed to be tourists. It is a puzzle: we ate all our meals in restaurants, mainly non-touristy ones, and the slender and chic women were eating their croissants and creme brulee right along with the men. No picking at lettuce leaves for them.   I highly recommend this book, and hope everyone who buys it will use the recipes as little adventures if they haven't been cooking this way, perhaps setting aside some Sunday afternoons to play and explore (this is not eight minutes in the microwave cooking, for sure).   And go see the movie.

B000CNESU8|5.0|With all these reviews of this great film I only have one comment: can you believe that it has really happened? Back when this film debuted objective journalism and TV news was still a real option. There were still broadcast journalists. The idea that news would become just a sideshow of entertainment, propaganda, and misrepresenting to garner ratings was considered satire. But it really happened. Just turn on MSNBC. Sunday Morning political news. Reality TV shows. Forget the evening news - it doesn't exist anymore. Barbara Walters? A shill on the View. Channel your inner Howard Beale - \\"I'm mad as hell and I'm not going to take it anymore!\\" Open your windows. Let me hear you in Queens!    PS - One of the greatest American films ever. I'm not sure if it's greater than \\"Citizen Kane\\" or \\"The Godfather\\" but it's pretty darn good. Worth owning. Worth seeing again. Now more than ever.
