1416562605|5.0|What appealed to me most was the language which is very very contemporary to India. It was a very refreshing escape from the purist diction we are used to reading. The plot, the humour, the twists, the takes on the political establishment, the genuine praise and veiled sarcastic attacks on our neighbour are all very engaging. 270 pages of life bundled into an absolute page-turner!

B0013FSL3E|5.0|Filmmaker Andrew Stanton (Finding Nemo) says Wall-e is not about the environment or obesity, but about relationships. Not to dispute the director, but isn't that what all romantic comedies, if not all films - if not all stories - are about? The romance between Wall-e and Eve is obviously the heart of the film. But the PLOT is about something else. So, even though the filmmakers were not consciously making a movie about the environment or obesity, Wall-e is about our present culture and how we are ruining ourselves and our planet by our obsession with instant gratification.<br /><br />For those who aren't aware, Wall-e is a very likable little robot that is part of a mechanized effort to clean up earth, while its inhabitants take an extended 5-year cruise aboard a fleet of luxury space ships, headed by one called the Axiom. Unfortunately, the project breaks down so that only Wall-e is left to finish the work, and the 5-year cruise has turned into 700 years! (I don't think Skipper and Gilligan need ever be ashamed again over their cruise going awry!)<br /><br />The Axiom sends a probe to earth to discover if there is any plant life remaining. When Wall-e meets the robot, Eve, whose directive (responsibility) is to acquire the specimen, love ensues. Eventually she does find one plant, which signals the probe to come back to pick her up. But Wall-e isn't about to let the love of his life disappear, so he stows away on the probe.<br /><br />When the probe reaches the mother ship, we discover that, over the course of the past 700 years, humans have become lazy, bloated floating couch potatoes. There is a plan in place that, should plant life be discovered on earth, the captain of the ship is to return to earth with his passengers. But someone wants to sabotage that plan by getting rid of the evidence of the plant. Wall-e and his girlfriend-robot try to save the plant and thus the plan.<br /><br />My favorite part of the film is the time spent in Wall-e's home. Like me, he's a collector, and his home if full of all the interesting objects he's found over the course of his career as a garbage robot: everything from extra parts in order to make repairs to himself, to a rubik's cube, a light bulb, a cigarette lighter and Christmas lights (all of which figure significantly in his relationship with Eve). His favorite find is an old VHS copy of Hello Dolly, which he cherishes religiously. He plays and hums one song in particular all day long while working with his best friend, an indestructible roach.<br /><br />I believe most guys will fully appreciate Wall-e, because he really speaks to the little boy in all of us - but I think he speaks to most women as well. I mean, what little boy wouldn't love rummaging through a really interesting garbage dump finding all kinds of neat gadgets and treasures they can keep? Maybe there are many little girls that feel the same way; but I think what most girls, young and old, will like best about Wall-e is the little robot's thoughtfulness: he would make a good friend.<br /><br />In spite of the wonderful romance and in spite of the character of the little robot Wall-e - or maybe because of them - I think what's most important about this film is the message it relays about what will happen to us culturally if we continue down this road of self-indulgent consumerism. The floating couch potatoes aboard the cruise ship spend their days in front of a screen, talking with their friends and sipping Buy-N-Large beverages. (Buy-N-Large is the mega company behind the rampant consumerism.) They don't even realize there are swimming pools and jogging tracks onboard the ship because they are so \\"plugged in\\" to their consumption and so out-of-touch with what is going on around them.<br /><br />It's an important message. So, whether rampant consumerism, resulting in an environmental wasteland and an obese society, is the main plot or a subplot, it is an important takeaway, as is how we treat each other. The relationship between the two main robots is obviously the centerpiece of the film, and their expressions and gestures are not only priceless, they are genius, because they are so human. I would also add that another important message is the importance of seeing the value in everything and everyone, rather than being so quick to throw them away. Wall-e is definitely a role model for that, even to the point of being best friends with a roach!

B001GQSY5U|4.0|So, I saw this originally in the theater.  I mean, it's Star Wars, you have to experience Star Wars in the theater.  I can now say I've seen every movie in said way (going back to '77).  I went into it with no preconceived notions about it, only that it was a new Star Wars movie.  I never saw a trailer or anything for this.  It was something I started when the prequel came out.  I wanted to know nothing about the movies before seeing them.<br />So, ok, this was just an excuse to make a movie.  The plot is cellophane thin.  I am actually all right with that.  The action scenes SCREAM Star Wars, Anakin and the other main characters are fleshed out a little more, and it is all in all good fun.  It is geared for a younger audience, but so were all the others.<br />Ahsoka is great.  Even at her tender age, she is able to keep up with the likes of the Chosen One.  Yes, there are certain characters that don't necessarily fit in with what most of us see as the Star Wars universe (Rotta, Ziro) but it was necessary for what story line there is.<br />All in all, I enjoyed watching this and YES I do own this on DVD.  I haven't been able to catch the series yet on Cartoon Network, but based on the movie (weak storyline and all), it has potential to expand, in a good way, the Star Wars Universe.

1416562605|3.0|One questio ran through my head through this book: How much does this story have in common with the real Bangalore?  Although I'm sensitive to the criticisms that this book cast India in an overly harsh light, I believe there must be some nucleus of truth that \\"The White Tiger\\" is built around.    The book is a quick read, but the style didn't strike me as particularly inspired or nuanced.  And I'm not sure whether or not burying the story inside a letter to Wen Jiabao added much.    I'd recommend reading this for one perspective on India, China, and the U.S. in the 21st century, but don't expect too engaging of a story.
B001GZ6QEC|5.0|The Dark Knight was the biggest movie in 2008, and it is no surprise that the blu-ray is packed with some great stuff. Christian Bale reprises the role as Batman/Bruce Wayne in this dark take on Batman. With the help of  Lt. Jim Gordon and District Attorney Harvey Dent Batman hopes to bring down the new villain in town, the psychotic Joker. When the Joker takes Bruce's love interest (Rachel Dawes) hostage Batman takes a darker turn and all hell breaks loose. This is one of the best Batman films to ever come out. The disturbingly yet amazing dark performance from Heath Ledger makes The Dark Knight a must own blu-ray.

You also get a digital copy which lets you put the movie to your Ipod, Iphone or other compatible portable device. One final note is that The Dark Knight marks the first time that a major feature film has been shot in part using IMAX cameras, marking a revolutionary integration of film formats. The Dark Knight Blu-ray disc takes advantage of the marriage of IMAX and 35mm formats by using the hybrid master to replicate the unique theatrical experience.

B001C3KCSY|4.0|So this year two pretty major developments took place in Southern Indie Rock.  Cult favorites My Morning Jacket and now Kings of Leon crossed over into the mainstream with their newest releases.  But these albums are totally different and say a lot about the bands respectively.    I won't rehash my harsh criticism of the MMJ album, except to say that it was not consistent with their previous efforts - in any way, except their penchant for experimentation.  It is a terrible album, but to their credit, they make some of it work very well live because they are a truly great band (see the recent Austin City Limits performance) .    This effort by KOL, on the other hand, is not experimental.  It is growth.  Think the difference between Death Cab's latest and Clap Your Hands Say Yeah's latest (which was just experimental piffle).  If you were around from the beginning with KOL and you did not see this coming, I'm sorry but you just weren't paying attention.  With each album and successive tour this band has shown tremendous growth by expanding their sound, not changing it.  The sonic elements that dominate this album are easily discernible in \\"Trani\\" from Youth and Young Manhood and others along the way.  Will they make a more rocking record next?  I hope so, but they deserved to make this album.  And it stands on its own as a very solid, and at times, brilliant effort.      Sure, KOL could have made jingle jangle albums for a few more years.  I would have bought them and I would have checked out their shows whenever they were in town.  But from the beginning, like many of us I loved this band not just for what they were, but for what they could become.  They continue to defy our expectations, in a good way.  KOL is now a great band.  Baby's all grown up, and I'm so proud.
B001BKG9SK|5.0|I am a rabid Floyd fan, but as yet have been unable to get very excited about Gilmour solo work.  I loved the historical significance of Waters' Berlin Wall performance, so I ordered the Live in Gdansk 2 CD/2 DVD edition for the same reason.  I have had it for a month now, and I haven't listened to or viewed anything else.  The CDs are filled with a perfect mix of some the best classic Floyd tunes as well as Gilmour's newer material.  Disc 3 is excellent, but the real treasure is disc 4.  I am always amazed when I hear the various components of Pink Floyd music coming together, but it's even more amazing to actually see it.  The highlights are Gilmour's slide guitar artistry on High Hopes, as well as the Barn Jam session, where he takes a turn on the drums.  What a musician!  I loaned it out, and disc 3 was damaged, so I'm seriously considering springing for the $115 edition.  It's that good!

0156034026|5.0|Mohsin Hamid's \\"The Reluctant Fundamentalist\\" seeks to elucidate the complex emotions successful immigrants into Western society feel about their own ethnicity, culture. identity and place in a superficially welcoming foreign culture. The unnamed tourist Changez addresses himself to in his narrative is merely a literary devise standing for the reader - quite clearly a foreigner - not necessarily but most likely American or European.     The format of this slim yet profound little novella is quite simple. Hamid enters the psyche of Changez, his protagonist who now returned to his own country reflects on the years he had spent in America, the proverbial land of opportunity open to whomsoever had the talent and the determination to make it. And make it he did - until things started to go wrong and then fall apart for him in his private and professional life following the 9/11 incident.     But why doesn't Changez feel unalloyed gratitude to America ? After all, America gave him the chance to elevate himself above the grinding poverty of his motherland and make a better life for himself in a new place. Worse and more puzzling is, why he feels secretly pleased - even if it's for the smallest fraction of a moment - when he learns about the 9/11 attack ?  The answers are there on the pages, written between the lines. Admiration for the host country's progressive values, mixed with a secret burning shame from having to subordinate one's own ethnicity simply to be accepted and then finding out that despite making these quiet concessions, one isn't and can never be accepted due to racial and religious differences. The result is a rage difficult to fathom and even more impossible to explain. The sheen of civility that exists between host and guest is shown to be fragile in the best of times. It shatters and then evaporates in an instant under stress.     Hamid has written a wonderful little book. His language is direct and sincere. He makes no apologies for either Changez or his host country. The bitterness and cryptic tone in Changez's voice conveys a disappointment that merely states a fact but doesn't attribute blame. Whether intentionally or not, Hamid made it hard for me to empathize with Changez's girlfriend Erica, her endless pining for her dead fiancé Chris and subsequent mental decline. She knew how Changez felt about her and yet used him - in my view - for a shoulder to cry on. Get over Chris or leave Changez alone. I wanted badly for him to throw her over. Pity he didn't and sadly paid for it.  Even Erica's mother's liberalism didn't help me like the family better.  Maybe Hamid intended to contrast the sensitive self absorbed individual Western psyche with more pragmatic Eastern concerns. Maybe not.     \\"The Reluctant Fundamentalist\\" is a timely reminder that globalisation may make the world flatter but doesn't make all cultures the same. The challenges are great and unless unceasing efforts are made to bridge people across cultures, peace will always be a mirage disrupted by race, language and religion. A wonderful little book. Buy it - you won't be disappointed.
B00000JBFW|5.0|In my opinion,this is the epitomy of all the Deep Purple (Gillian & Glover incl.) albums. The band brings a maturity here that makes the CD strong from beginning to end. Many of their 70's releases were plagued by filler material. Not so here. It's a must have for any Purple fan.
6304493681|5.0|For an epic like this, I can't recap it as well as others, and I'll probably bring nothing new.  With that said, there are an incredible amount of parallels to Hollywood sci-fi throughout, and here's the brief synopsis:<br /><br />In a hollow, grungy urban future ([[ASIN:0790729628 Blade Runner]]) with overt government control and covert corruption ([[ASIN:0452284236 Nineteen Eighty-Four]]), cybernetic police ([[ASIN:B00005N7Z1 Robocop]]), with augmented minds and cyborg bodies ([[ASIN:B00005N5S5 The Terminator]] & [[ASIN:6303200974 Star Trek - The Next Generation, Episode 42: Q Who?]]), are assigned to Section 9 of a police force that uses technology to arrest criminals ([[ASIN:B00009ZYC0 Minority Report]]).  One pair, Maj. Motoko Kisangani and Batou, are tracking down an infamous, anonymous cybercriminal, alias \\"The Puppetmaster\\".  He's a cyberterrorist on the international most wanted list, sometimes viewed as a virus within the mainframe ([[ASIN:B00000K19E The Matrix]]), and he's feared the world wide.  His specialty is \\"ghost hacking\\", which is essentially breaking into the brains and souls of other cybernetic beings wired into the system, controlling their movements ([[ASIN:B0006SSOHC Saw]]?).  He's been tapping into major political figures, and using humans as his lackeys by inserting false memories and lives, a simultaneous reality and fantasy ([[ASIN:B00070FX5U Total Recall]]).  During the rundown, Kisangani taps into the mainframe via ports in the back of her neck (Matrix) to trace the last known hacks.  The Puppet Master is shown to be creatively conniving villain, with an arsenal of powerful weapons and thermoptic camouflage ([[ASIN:B000244EMO Predator]]) at his disposal.  His insidious secondary goal, however, sheds light onto the complicated concepts of life and the philosophical \\"existence precedes essence\\" concept of robotic/cybernetic existentialism (Short Circuit, Wall-E, Steve Guttenberg in every Police Academy movie).<br /><br />What I found very interesting was the concept of \\"ghost hacking\\".  Breaking the barriers of others' brains, people who are wired into the system - technological brain control - doesn't seem to be all that unlike the trance placed over droves of easily persuaded, technologically-dependant teens of today.  What happens in the movie may be a little more direct, but the results are nonetheless similar.<br /><br />One other very compelling concept is the creation of a perfect being.  Whether it's Ghost in the Shell, The Fifth Element, or Weird Science, the perfect being usually ends up being a naked or scantily clothed woman, usually appearing in either a vulnerable or fetal position (Terminator).  I agree wholeheartedly with this concept.<br /><br />For anyone not already a fan of animation, start here.  You'll soon be one.

B00003CWL6|5.0|American Beauty reflects the beginnings of the \\"Impressionistic\\" stage of movie making. The scenes and characters are conglomerations of situations and \\"types\\" of people... The real estate agent, the bored commercial writer, the unhappy teenager, the uptight military officer, the Stepford wife, the abused son, etc. Each person plays his role according to his type.     The movie successfully reveals pent up emotions beautifully such as when the real estate agent ends her day of promoting a home she's selling by bursting into tears after the last visitor leaves. I'd never really thought about how painful it is to be upbeat about selling so-so real estate.     Yes, this movie has shortcomings, but it succeeds in its ability to reveal emotions without filling in every detail. Be reminded that on one hand the story is depressing, yet on the other it is uplifting because the harmed party did it his way.    Not a first date type of flick. It is genuinely made for intense discussion.

038533348X|5.0|Vonnegut's novel takes the reader into the myriad faces of human emotions--from disenchantment to awe, skepticism to empathy, from horror and madness to succor and redemption. This dryly humorous and unforgivingly scathing story of the seemingly inevitable tendency of humans to think up of ways to destroy themselves, or, simply, to make complete wretches of their lives, is at times too incredulous to be taken seriously, and yet the author has managed to slip in some amazingly straightforward insights people nowadays would probably hardly acknowledge readily, too preoccupied we are with the superfluous things in life.<br /><br />I certainly enjoyed Cat's Cradle with its memorable zany characters, unashamed views on tolerance, hypocrisy, and even religion. It takes a jab at the senselessness of war, the farcical stage that is politics, and ponders the possibility that life can be lived so simply but it seems that that idea for us nowadays is too complex to grasp.<br /><br />Makes the reader sit back and think while still helplessly embroiled in the world of \\"Bokononism\\" and the twists and turns of fate the narrator was dealt with. A veritable tour de force.
1932907009|5.0|While this may not actually be the last book on screenwriting you'll ever need (partly because you'll find yourself also wanting Blake Snyder's next book \\"Save the Cat Goes to the Movies), it is an excellent guide for screenwriters because it gives a different slant on understanding genres and screenplay composition.  After you've read Syd Field, William Goldman, Russin & Robbins, etc., Blake comes at the topic from a different angle that, at least for me, brought about an Aha! moment.    If you're interested in ever selling a screenplay, you'll want to read other books as well, but I highly recommend Snyder's work as not-to-be-missed on your list.
B000FDFVZ6|4.0|Alice Sebold has stated that violence is not unusual and concludes that it is merely a part of life.  Through her three books written, including The Lovely Bones, Sebold adjoins those who have witnessed violence with those who have not.    Alice Sebold has written three novels in her writing career.  Her first novel, Lucky, is a memoir of her life as an eighteen year old rape victim while she attended Syracuse University in New York.  Her other pieces of work also possess some twist of either rape or murder. Sebold reflects her own life and personal experience into her books.     Sebold grasps onto the best words to express what she wants the reader to know, feel, and experience as if we were there to see the characters emotions.  The Lovely Bones consists of a young girl brutally raped and killed by means of being dismembered and her family's way of coping while she watches above from heaven.  Her words and writings are truly realistic, for she herself experienced such a crime.  As a freshman in high school, I am simply used to being exposed to \\"happy\\" literature.  Sebold gives you the real emotions and happenings as alarming and bitter as they may be.  I found myself looking up at the end of certain chapters with nothing short of a stunned look upon my face.    With all the crimes committed in this world, such as the one written in this novel and the ones you briefly read about in the newspaper, what we read does not even convey the amount of terror and sorrow one could feel by reading this book.  This novel breaks adolescences' minds out of their young and naïve nature and gives them the necessary reality check to ensure safety in their future years to come in this world that grows more dangerous by the minute.

This is because of the very deep mistake made by Tolle and  even Wayne Dyer.  They are EGO-BASHING speakers and authors who  mistakenly say the EGO is the cause of people's problems.  This is false.  The EGO is simply the TOTAL PERSONALITY which includes good habits or  bad habits, faults or talents.  But when we are NOT SELF REFLECTIVE, we  allow the bad habits to rule, not realizing they are located in our brain  and are not caused by outside person place or thing.  Voila.  Failure of  the \\"positive thinking\\" to work.   Also they claim (especially Wayne Dyer) we all have FREE WILL. This is  also untrue.  Only until self reflection does anyone have the choice to  change their thinking to change their life.  Until SELF REFLECTION AWARENESS OF AWARENESS there is no chance of changing your thinking to change your life.  You are just lying to yourself.  Thinking and growing rich won'twork because as you think \\"I am rich!\\" the unreflective part of your ego says \\"Liar, liar pants on fire.\\"  ok?  When self-reflective you can then think 1. Where is the feeling of poverty? Answer: Inside  2. Can I change that feeling somehow?  Answer: Well, I will try!\\"  so you have the keys to the kingdom.  This is also true of the book THE SECRET and why there is not a lot of success with that book either. My book SCIENCE AND THE UNITY OF CONSCIOUSNESS explains all this.

B0013ND30M|4.0|I own the previous DVD edition of this product and will keep it.  Saying this, I agree the picture's aspect ratio is much better.  Why it wasn't issued at the aspect ratio initially is another story for another time.  I give it only four stars for the fact that the 50th Anniversary Edition does not retain all the features from the previous edition and the full screen version forcing me to keep the previous edition.
B001EYGOEM|5.0|I don't usually write reviews on music but I had to about Taylor Swift's latest CD.  I also am not a big female country music fan but in all honesty I can not stop listening to this CD.  Every single song has meaning and is excellently written.  Taylor Swift has a peaceful voice at times and then it is very determined and passionate.  I absolutely love every single song.  This is the best CD I have purchased in a very long time.

B0014DZ2VO|5.0|Don't be misled, by naysayers....the first BOND movie I ever saw in the theater was a Roger Moore one, so I'd be the first to complain about a gadget-free, grimmer BOND film, but Daniel Craig is just so damn awesome as proto-super-spy JAMES BOND that I can't gripe. Original Bond Sean Connery, who had the least amount of spy-tech, is considered by many hardcore Bond-buffs to be the quintessential screen-version of Ian Fleming's character of the novels. So this latest grittier reboot begun in of the 40something series is a natural. Even before Austin Powers spoofs of the genre, the Bond franchise had become a parody of itself, even with a passable run by Pierce Brosnan. So again, the reboot to make Bond relevant shouldn't come as a surprise. Also in 20something movies made for the franchise, never before has an actual sequel been made. Taking its cues from the successful 21st century spy films like the Bourne trilogy, \\"Quantum of Solace\\" directly picks up where \\"Casino Royale\\" leaves off with the newly \\"00\\" licensed Bond following surviving the thread to his betrayal by and of his \\"first love.\\" A thread ultimately left open for a possible Bond trilogy of it's own, as Craig is on board for 2 additional films, this is likely. Absent also are some Bond's series staples like his shaken-not-stirred Martini (though this is still played with) and his signature \\"Bond, James, Bond\\" self-intro. As close as Connery's Bond comes to being the perfect interpretation of the book character, Daniel Craig is the real deal (in real life as well, in the ½ yr shoot he had surgery to repair a shoulder injury, 8 stitches, and had a hand wound cauterized in an ER). There are fight sequences which maybe derivative of the Bourne movies in their \\"rawness\\" and shear brutality, but never before has the sometime cold assassin's nature of Bond come through as loud and clear as in Craig's portrayal. M,  again (5 for her, I think) played by Dame Judi Dench who is still sooo perfect, like a disapproving headmistress of some English boarding school for wayward boys. While, obviously, not Fleming's original M in description, certainly in spirit, and any time she and Craig occupy the screen together, you can't help but be riveted. Director Marc Forster is also due some credit here, while continuing to deliver the explosions and fights expected in a Bond film, Forster also delivers extending the makeover started in \\"Casino\\" portraying Bond as a physically and emotionally vulnerable man. He also did some pretty stylistic sequences including a opera montage synced with Bond fighting for his life.<br /><br />\\"Quantum\\" is based on work of Ian Fleming in name only, in fact, the original short story was written as sort of a non-Bond story, with Bond listen to a tale about a mundane world he would never know. But, there is very little that is mundane about the film of the same title. Most the classic Bond chase environments omitted by \\"Casino\\" are covered this time...like an airplane chase (and obligatory freefall), a boat chase and a secret installation to erupt into a exploding inferno. There are cars of course, the pre-title opening alone is worth admission and will likely qualify the near fatal injuries sustained by a stuntman. The locales are beautiful and exotic, as is to be expected, Italy and South America mostly, as Bond and M discover a secret organization, so secret that even their intelligence ops have never heard of Quantum, and they literally have people \\"all around them.\\" The new baddie is a pseudo-environmentalist evil who's name, not without Bond irony, is Greene, played by Mathieu Amalric. He's causing South American droughts to further his own agenda and ultimately is dealt-with uniquely, while the bigger  fish quietly escapes (The Bond Ultimatum, anyone?). But the pilot hardly matters;it is merely a vehicle to further explore this new Bond.<br /><br />On the Bond girl front: Olga Kurylenko, teams up with Bond, seeking her own vengeance and in the process somewhat tempers Bond's own quest, by the end.  Gemma Arterton, plays Agent (Strawberry) Fields who  briefly plays a Bond foil, who ends up another in the increasing line of Bond's collateral damage, but her demise is a less glamorous  homage to Jill Masterson of Goldfinger.mpers Bond's own quest, by the end.

0930289234|4.0|One thing I really, truly like about Watchmen, that sets it apart from other works of superhero fiction, is the way it treats its heroes. They, on the most part, are fully aware of how silly dressing up in a theatrical costume and running around fighting crime is, and the more sane amongst them treat the enterprise as very tongue-in-cheek. With the exception of one hero they have no powers, and thus distinguishing between one hero or heroine and the next becomes highly character-driven rather than \\"oh he's the guy with the claws\\" or \\"oh he has the eye lasers\\".<br /><br />Speaking of characters, the characters here are extremely well-written. Two examples:<br /> - Rorschach is a vigilante detective with a sordid past and a rapidly deteriorating psyche. By the opening of the story he considers his Rorschach persona to take presidence over his alter ego, and refers to his mask as his \\"face\\".<br /> - Doctor Manhattan, the only superhero with any real powers, is rapidly and dramatically losing his feelings of being human to the point of self-imposed exile from Earth. Described as a walking H-bomb, his withdrawal from Earth violently upsets the balance of power between the US and Russia, and threatens to start World War Three.<br /><br />My only real beef with this novel, and the reason it only got 4/5 stars, is the ending. Though brilliantly orchestrated, it has a critical flaw in relation to real-world events, and you should stop reading now if you don't like spoilers.<br /><br />The \\"villain\\", if he can even be called that, aims to stop WWIII by staging a massive attack on New York city that wipes out half the population, and makes it seem as if other attacks are imminent and that the world needs to ally against this new, perceived, and potentially permanent threat - and it works. My problem with this is that something to this effect actually happened, what with 9/11 and all, and the world sympathy only lasted for a period of a month or so, and then everyone went backto hating who they hated before. It's not really the fault of the authors that they mis-judged humanity's capacity for caring about each other, but it does kind of lessen the impact of the novel in this day and time.
B000UJCALI|5.0|'The Shining',where would we be without Stanley Kubrick's distorted version of Stephen King's classic novel?the horror industry would be at a standstill.This is my absolute favorite of horror-films,it's a very dark film indeed.Believe it or not,this film is not much like the novel the one made for TV in early 2000 had more elements from the book not mentioned in the 1980 version-which actually works for me:)kubrick unlocked the darkest doors to his imagination when he made this film.Everything from the creepy little twins,to the Timberline Lodge Hotel(shown as the Overlook Hotel in the movie).Down to the old song you hear in the ballroom which was written in the 20's or 30's by Ray Noble and his Mayfair Dance Orchestra and the eerie film score by Wendy Carlos.There's not too many people who haven't seen this film and i've never met someone who didn't like it.If you've never seen this film shame on you for calling yourself a fan of Horror Movies and go buy this film!
B00005JKGZ|5.0|Vincent Minelli's period musical is about a family to whom . . . well, nothing really happens in this movie. But if you can give yourself over to its message that (once again) there's no place like home, you'll see that this picture is a thing of pure beauty.     A wonderful score, the most beautiful use of Technicolor you may ever see, and Judy Garland. What's most remarkable about this movie is the complexity of its delivery. Yes, it presents a rose-colored picture of good old days that may never have been. But the cast believes in it. Everything is just a bit heightened -- the colors are rich and seductive, the lighting casts deep shadows and textures across the screen, the banter among family members is more clever than it would ever really be, and the sense of importance around the moments in this year in a family's life make them feel like little jewels to be treasured. Without making too big a point of saying so (ok, so every scene opens with a framed photograph), Minelli presents us with a picture book of memories. This may not be how things ever were, but it is how people would like to remember them.     Music advances the story in ways few musicals manage to pull off. And it certainly doesn't hurt to have Garland deliver the most memorable ones: \\"The Trolley Song,\\" \\"The Boy Next Door,\\" and \\"Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas.\\"    Our point of view keeps shifting between those of our two main characters -- Judy Garland's Rose and Margaret O'Brien's Tootie -- and there's a persistent sense of seeing things the way they might have . . . or the way they might look back on these memories. O'Brien's Halloween night is not simply beautiful -- dark and moody, lit by moonlight and bonfires -- but it allows you to see and feel as she might, or as she might remember that night. The camera is low and tracks with her, looking up at houses and adults and the dark tree tops.     And yes, it's a perfect movie for the holidays. Sure, the story's climax takes place on Christmas. But, most importantly, it's the movie's perspective on the fond memories of childhood that makes this an especially good fit for the season.
B000MV8ZD6|5.0|I remember the first time I saw 'House By the Cemetary' I was in my early teens and since then I loved this movie.The background story leaves a few questions to be answered but it's a low-budget horror film,what did you expect?beyond the small details the film is fantastic!This film came out in 1984 to be exact(I should know I have the original Vestron Video),this film is not for the squeamish.If your'e unfamiliar with Lucio Fulci's films he has some realistic gore effects used in his movies.But if you can handle the SAW films,you can handle House By The Cemetary:)I would recommend renting it before buying it though.
B00005QCVY|5.0|Frank Capra's meditation on the connections each man builds to those around him is the pure, distilled essence of holiday spirit. In a world that's forever beating us down with reminders of our isolation and of the lack of meaning in our lives, this  is a bright and shiny rebuttal.     I don't know that anyone but Jimmy Stewart could play the nice guy who always does the right thing and inject that character with the darkness necessary to turn a schmaltzy premise into a profound statement of each man's place in his world. A great supporting cast (including Thomas Mitchell, Gloria Grahame, Ward Bond, Henry Travers and Beulah Bondi) led by a brilliant director. Nicely remastered print. And while the extra features were just lifted from 80s TV broadcasts, they do have interesting information in them.
B000001GPX|4.0|Kleiber's account of the 5th stands out because of its precision and speed. Usually these two factors relate inversely and therein lies Kleiber's achievement, I would say, especially considering that this symphony's drama requires an urgency. Karajan's '63 recording is precise and reasonably quick, however it is a rather interpretive account and also pares off some of the space between the strings, bass, and brass. Karajan's '77 recording may be equally interpretive in its conception but nonetheless, in effect, returns to a more traditional sound because the bass and brass are given more volume and space. However, the '77 recording is far from precise, in fact, because Karajan goes for such a textured and broad sound, the orchestral sections somtimes move ahead or behind of each other because they are so intergrated within themselves (instruments within the section).   Kleiber's recording is urgent and precise, which is like the HvK'63, but much less interpretive and THUS people go nuts for it with the belief that it represents the truest expression of Beethoven's intention.    BUT, it does sound very metallic, and by that I mean that being both mincing and fast, it doesn't have the warmth and storminess that many people identify with Beethoven and which conveys much of the content of his music. This recording is perhaps too clean and technical, but that depends where one finds the language of the music. Certainly some of Keliber's precision does help to annunciate some of the finer lyricism of the symphony.    One last thing to mention, which is sadly a major boo-boo on behalf of DG, is the bit-processing which they do on all their \\"Originals\\" series. Throughout some of the best parts of all the movements, especially when the crescendos open up, there are these hideous digital \\"chinking\\" sounds all over the place - \\"chink....dink...dink\\", simply awful! It is manifestly something to do with their remastering software techniques. Other reviewers here have described the DG recording and subsequent remastering as flat, and I wouldn't disagree.    This is, in some terms and measures, a masterful piece of music making, but it is in no way definitive (speaking of definitive recordings is really pretty dumb), and perhaps more represents something which was missing up until its inception - that is, a passionate but sober (Klemperer) as well as urgent and fine (Karajan) recording.
B000056HE9|3.0|An angel comes to visit a bishop for Christmas, to guide him away from material things and toward a higher purpose.     Sounds a little heavy-handed. But strong performances from David Niven and Loretta Young make it convincing by focusing our attention on the real magic of the story: the idea that to make a heaven on earth requires only that we extend to our fellows some kindness and goodwill.    A wonderful supporting cast brings that message to life. Elsa Lanchester and Sara Haden are wonderful as the Bishop's housekeeper and secretary. But its Gladys Cooper who persuades us of the magic in that sentiment. She turns the stereotype of the bitter, rich widow into a character who resonates with the bittersweet treasure of memories and the joy to be found in opening one's self to the world around her.     This story has so much magic in its premise that there's little need for special effects. So it's disappointing that the director, Henry Koster, relies on some showy visual tricks. When he chooses more subtle ways to suggest the work of the supernatural, the effect is much more satisfying because it makes the wonder of the movies characters that much more plausible.    Cary Grant's performance is the surprisingly weak piece in the ensemble. But one of the nice things about movie stars is that some need only walk in front of the camera to satisfy. Mr. Grant always does.     Despite this movie's shortcomings -- and despite my criticisms -- give this one a chance.
B00006G9QN|3.0|The book is an interesting read, if not wholly credible.      There is reason to doubt that everything Col. Corso related was the exact truth.    There are several technological innovations which - he says - were the result of alien technology discovered with the downed ship eventually being given to researchers who were able to use some of the information to develop great advances in design and capability of some products.     His critics say that he has insulted the work of the actual human inventors of those products.      It has also been stated that Col. Corso did not actually serve on the NSC and could not have done some of the things that he said he did while in the Army.      It may be a work of science-fiction masquerading as biography-cum-science but it was still interesting to read.

B001ED7C58|4.0|After seeing that Robert Pattinson sings and checking out the list of artists on the soundtrack... I wasn't ready for anything great. But the more I listen to the soundtrack, the more I can associate the music and lyrics to moments in our beloved first Twilight book. I think that the songs were carefully chosen and work perfectly with the story.<br /><br />I know many aren't fans of Robert Pattinson singing, but the more I listen to his songs the more I like them.<br /><br />It is definitely worth your time and money!

B001C08RHA|5.0|Review Number 447.<br /><br />What has red plates, an arc converter, firepower, the ability to fly, and Robert Downey, Jr inside? Yes, I know you know--Iron Man! What with the magic of movie making tricks, a great cast, a creative director, and the edgy, cagey star power of Downey, why wouldn't this movie be a hit? A BIG HIT!<br /><br />The really wild aspect of this movie is that it does not have the feel or look of a comic book. It's more akin to true sci-fi--take a man who has barbs of a modern bomb in his chest, barbs that will migrate to his heart without a battery attached to keep them stationary. Then take this same man who is a munitions genius holed up in a cave with crazed, power hungry Middle Easterners as his captors, demanding the Jericho bomb for their very own. They have many of his weapon types with the puzzling question--how did these weapons end up in their possession?<br /><br />Tony Stark, son of a powerful, very wealthy weapons designer and maker, and godson of Jeff Bridges' character who assumed the mantle of the company at the founder's death, finally has an awakening to the true meaning of destruction while a captive. He must escape with the mysterious, multi-lingual man who assists him in the creation of an escape device--an iron suit, indestructible (for a short while).<br /><br />I've given a background for Iron Man--how he came to be, his inner turmoil leading to a change in professional and personal direction. Robert Downey Jr. makes this all work with his slim, but not powerful physique. He's just Joe Average physically--well, better than that because he has no fat, but he is not bulked up. It is his face, those eyes that make his every close-up so conducive to the building of the story. In his early middle age, Downey has IT and makes IT work in his character and role.<br /><br />Other actors contribute as much: Jeff Bridges (always a favorite actor) becomes an excellent villain. My gosh, in his first scene the viewer knows  he will be a villain. He looks the part! Terrence Howard continues to build his impressive resume here, although he doesn't have as much to do, but his last line sets his role in a sequel.<br /><br />Although Gwenth Paltrow plays the handy girl assistant-- again, the viewer knows that her role will also expand in the future.  As for the S.H.E.I.L.D. agent, I expected him to say \\"the Other Christine\\" at any moment.<br /><br />\\"Iron Man\\" is an exciting movie. I expect to see it again! What's the record for reviews of a movie on Amazon? I expect this one will break that record! Once a person views this film she just has to praise it--it's that good (if you like violence and excitement and creative genius and heroes and desire to do the right thing and....see what I mean?)Howard continues to build his impressive resume here, although he doesn't have as much to do, but his last line sets his role in a sequel.

I thought this was a terrible story.
B000ZOXDFA|4.0|In this sequel to Shekhar Kapur's 1998 Elizabeth, The Golden Age addresses Elizabeth's status in 1585, faced with war with Spain and the fate of her cousin, Mary Stuart, ousted from the Scottish throne and seeking Elizabeth's aid in reclaiming her rightful place. While plotting treachery against England, Stuart (Samantha Morton) enjoys the freedom to send secret missives to Spain. And Philip II of Spain (Jordi Molla) schemes to deliver the rigors of the Inquisition to England and banish Elizabeth (Kate Blanchett). On a more personal level, Elizabeth is enchanted by an adventurous Sir Walter Raleigh (Clive Owen), recently returned from the New World and bursting with ideas for England's expansion across the sea. Unwilling to release the charming Raleigh for a return voyage, Elizabeth increasingly depends upon him to fill the lonely hours of what is a very solitary reign. The ageing Francis Wallsingham (beautifully understated by the always precise Geoffrey Rush) stands guard at the queen's side, delivering the news she is reluctant to entertain, his conscientiousness grown tiresome, but increasingly necessary over the years.<br /><br />As events unfold, Elizabeth will face two momentous decisions: how to dispose of her blood relative and fellow-queen, Mary Stuart; and how to successfully engage in war with Spain, Philip's armada soon to arrive off the coast of England, far superior to England's maritime efforts. More painful, personally, is Raleigh's betrayal- Elizabeth's handmaiden, Bess, is carrying his child, yet another bitter pill for this beleaguered queen to swallow on her solitary sojourn as queen of England. Despite Blanchett's perfect beauty in this role and her adaptation of a more mature, yet still deeply emotional monarch, the true star of the film is the extravagant cinematography. The plot line is less than stirring, yet I find it impossible to grade this film with less than four stars for its arresting images. Scene after scene captures the essence of an era, perfectly rendered, historically accurate details: Philip stalking through his palace, black-cloaked and followed by chanting monks, the air suffused with light and grace; Elizabeth, alone in her rooms, the castle huge and hollow without the comfort of one who loves more than serves her.<br /><br />On the precipice of the battle, Elizabeth emerges to rally her troops, the daunting Spanish armada visible off the coast. She is magnificent in silver armor on a white horse, long red tresses streaming down her back, an iconic Joan d' Arc to spur the men to victory in the face of a superior force. While Raleigh directs the English ships, the battle is engaged, the sea eventually filled with the bodies of the vanquished, Spanish Inquisitors, men of God, horses plunging over the sides of ships, weighty crucifixes tumbling into the deep while Elizabeth and Wallsingham rejoice. Silent much of the time, Blanchett rules this role through the force of her personality, leaving no doubt about the queen's terrible choices and brilliant monarchy. Still as a statue, she stands, hands raised to her people, a vision in white, lonely yet unforgettable. I can still see the striking images in this film, a testament to art and cinematography.

B0014DZ2VO|2.0|The first of the Craig 007 movies was excellent all round: solid script, superior acting (for the genre) and outstanding direction and camerawork.  This second episode is atrocious.  It is difficult to exaggerate just how feeble this movie truly is.  Starting with the context-free car chase (Wow! A car chase! How original!) through to a disjointed rooftop chase - which must have been more interesting to make than it is to watch - through to an airplane chase... ho hum, another day, another chase to endure.  The problem is that without a real story and without pausing to let us get close to what the actors are trying to do, it's all just random noise and silly sequences.  Bang, boom, thud - and that's the sound of the audience slamming the doors on the way out of the theater or falling from their chairs in a catatonic trance.<br /><br />The second unit camerawork is pathetic - all jumpy cuts and disjointed sequences that rob the frenetic action scenes of any emotional interest and for some people may actually induce a migraine.  The script is flat. This movie feels like it was cobbled together from a third-rate video game.  The producers should have looked at the rushes early on and have replaced both the director and the second unit director post haste.  As it is, a lot of money was squandered to no good effect.  The only positive thing to say about this dire effort is that at least it is fairly short.<br /><br />We can only hope the third in the Craig series of Bond movies involves a director who is capable of producing something more than this amateurish juvenile film-school type of montage.  There's a world of difference between compelling and innovative camera work with tight edits and a disjointed mess of sound and fury that signifies nothing.  Much better to save your money and instead spend it on a copy of the totally excellent Il y a longtemps que je t'aime, even though you'll have to purchase it via amazon.fr because the US site doesn't stock it.

B0014DZ2VO|4.0|Despite the ridiculous title, \\"Quantum of Solace\\" is an engaging film, and like its predecessor, \\"Casino Royale,\\" it gave me more of what I wanted from a James Bond movie. Granted, \\"Casino Royale\\" is the better of the two, not only because Daniel Craig was cast as Agent 007, but also because it told a more compelling story. It also completely reinvented the spy genre, leaving behind many of the sillier elements that dragged down so many other Bond films. What \\"Quantum of Solace\\" has going for it is that, for the most part, it follows in the same footsteps; gone are the preposterous gadgets, the cartoonish villains, and their infantile plots to take over the world. Also gone are Miss Moneypenny and Q, character I never felt were necessary anyway. As for Bond, Craig retains the same rough-around-the-edges quality I liked--a far cry from the earlier Bonds, who were so pristine and super suave that it was hard to get past.    The plot of \\"Quantum of Solace\\" is essentially an extension of \\"Casino Royale,\\" which ended with the death of Vesper Lynd, the woman who was blackmailed into betraying Bond. But who exactly was behind her betrayal? An early interrogation scene with the nefarious Mr. White (Jesper Christensen) hints at a mysterious organization called Quantum, which supposedly has members hidden all over the world. While following a lead in Haiti, Bond meets a fiery Russian woman named Camille Montes (Olga Kurylenko), who's on a revenge mission of her own. Her partner, the heartless Dominic Greene (Mathieu Amalric), is a Quantum member posing as the chairman for Greene Planet, an environmentalist organization. His dastardly plot involves taking control of Bolivia's water supply by staging a military coup.    The interesting thing about this film, as well as \\"Casino Royale,\\" is that Bond isn't a perfect person. Not only is he capable of making costly mistakes, he's also at odds with the very people he serves under. His superior, M (Judi Dench), is wary around Agent 007 because he tends to make very irrational decisions, such as killing suspects before anyone has a chance to question them. She wants to trust him, but he's making it difficult. \\"I think you're so blinded by inconsolable rage that you don't care who you hurt,\\" she tells him at one point. \\"When you can't tell your friends from your enemies, it's time to go.\\" He's become one-tracked, which could help to explain the film's lack of overt sexuality; Bond sleeps with exactly one woman in \\"Quantum of Solace,\\" and no, it isn't Camille. We see this in a scene so short that the raw passion is pretty much glossed over. While I do recognize that many 007 fans will find this bothersome, I didn't really have a problem with it. I'd much rather think of Bond as a flawed secret agent than as a babe magnet.    I might have just crossed into dangerous territory here, because I'm well aware how nostalgic some people are for the campier, less introspective Bond films, the ones with that gave the women silly names like Jenny Flex, Pussy Galore, Plenty O'Toole, Xenia Onatopp, Octopussy, Penelope Smallbone, and Honey Rider. The villain isn't hidden under goofy disfigurement makeup, and his sinister plot doesn't involve creating a new undersea civilization or destroying targets with a satellite death ray. If this is your cup of tea, then \\"Quantum of Solace\\" is not for you. Not only are the characters given normal names, the movie itself is also gritty and dark, a revenge film as opposed to a fantasy spy caper. I may be in the minority, but I prefer this newer, more realistic depiction of James Bond. He's a fully realized character of depth and complexity, free from his days as an escapist novelty. For the first time since \\"Casino Royale,\\" I actually want to know what will happen to him on his next mission.    There is, however, one specific moment that I feel is worth mentioning. There's a shot of a dead woman lying on a bed, her body covered with crude oil. Clearly, director Marc Forsterwas paying homage to the opening scene of \\"Goldfinger.\\" But what do you think it says that gold has been replaced by oil? In today's political climate, oil seems to be the most valuable substance on earth. This isn't to say that \\"Quantum of Solace\\" makes an overt political commentary; above all, it's a fun-filled action film. But a few statements do pop up here and there, which I felt was a nice touch.    But as I said early on, \\"Casino Royale\\" was the better of the two new Bond films. \\"Quantum of Solace\\" has an interesting premise, but it seems to rely more on action and less on a fully developed plot. Still, it's an enjoyable film. I particularly liked Amalric's performance, giving Greene not only base animal instincts in matters of survival, but also a pitiable quality that's extremely effective. There isn't a nice bone in this man's body, and you can tell this is so even with a dashing smile on his face. And Craig, well, he remains one of the best James Bonds ever. He's driven, but he's also reckless, and even if he never says so, there are obviously moments when even he doesn't understand why he does what he does. At this point, I have nothing but high hopes for the next installment in the Bond series.
B001GKJ2DO|5.0|I'm thrilled to learn the DVD will be released for Christmas. I saw the movie nine times in the theater, with each of my adult daughters, my \\"girlfriends\\" from work, and with my husband, who insisted on seeing it 4 times! The music sticks with you and leaves you happy and humming for days! Thank goodness for a movie that is just about feeling good -- it is a welcome relief these days. Kudos to the sparkling cast who obviously gave it their all! I look forward to the DVD release so I can have a good dose of happy whenever I need it!
B000N3SSBM|5.0|If you've ever had a relationship....I think you'll enjoy this well produced film. The acting is good, the direction is good and the story is unique and well written.
159562015X|5.0|I have used this book/test many times and believe it to be a real tool for helping individuals and groups focus on strengths rather than weaknesses. There is a Proverb in the Bible that says something like, \\"Do you see a man skilled in his work?\\" In other words, the best at what he/she does? \\"That man will stand before kings.\\"   The premise of focusing on the gifts God has specifically given you and teaming up with others so they can use their strengths where you are weak is  how I believe God meant things to be.
0375826726|5.0|I loved this series- this is book three, so you'll have to read them in order- Book one is \\"Eragon\\" and book two \\"Eldest\\". I guess I am a 56 year old child- but if you like fantasy books- dragons, elves, and adventures then this is great for any age. I am looking forward to the next book by Christopher Paolini.
B000065BPB|5.0|These headphones are so good that it brings out the limits of your MP3s, AACs, etc. It makes you want to re-rip all your digital media to the highest settings possible. These phones are that good! Such a bargain for the price. Crystal clear, excellent frequency response, and a beautifully balanced sound. These won't disappoint and feel like they should cost twice as much.
0060558121|5.0|Neil Gaiman understands something about the collective unconscious and the way Gods form within it. He also knows something about the way these Gods interact. I think the reason his books resonate with so many (I mean heck there are more than 700 reviews on this site alone), is that he speaks truth within fiction.<br /><br />I love the TechnoGod, the brash kid and the conflict between the old and the new. This is real folks, more real than you can imagine.
B000002UVX|5.0|Hello!    Machine Gun alone is a reason for buying this CD. It is well worth the price of admission!
0060557818|5.0|This was the first Neil Gaiman novel I ever read. I picked it up in London as we were boarding the plane to fly back to Canada. I know the London Underground very well, having lived in the city off and on since 1970. What I immediately loved was the way he plays back and forth with metaphor and description. I mean, Earls Court as a real court inhabiting one of the coaches - brilliant!<br /><br />This guy really knows how to bring myth to life, and by myth I don't mean something that has no contact with reality, I mean the something that underlies reality, just as the London Underground exists beneath the city.<br /><br />If a genie popped out of a bottle to grant me just one wish it would be \\"Please teach me to write like Neil Gaiman.\\"
B000AP04OM|5.0|It was a great family night movie.  Both my 8 year old and 4 year old enjoyed it.  Very different from the usual movie night movies and a welcome change.  Very long for the younger one  - he fell asleep and woke up a couple times but well worth the price for this classic.
0765342294|4.0|I am a freshman in high school and I thought that Ender's Game was a fantastic book. Ender is a six year old boy that gets taken into space to be trained for war. While it is hard to believe that a six year old is getting trained for war, it is amazing to read about everything these young children can do. The adults and the world leaders actually believe that the children have potential to help the world, instead of just being worthless children. Orson Scott Card describes the different places and events so well that you really get drawn into the book. It makes you feel as if you are there with the characters watching the story unravel itself. Card also brings in many different challenges and he shows how Ender copes with all the difficulties. An example is that Ender had many people that hated him and even wanted to kill him. When these people attacked Ender, he had no choice but to fight back. Even though his enemies were all bigger, stronger, and older than him he was still able to beat them by using his amazing strategist skills. All of the different plot twists makes the book very interesting and you never get bored while you read it. The book also shows how a very hostile alien race, the buggers, was planning to kill all of the humans, and take over Earth had some kind-hearted members that wanted to live in peace with the humans. Ender found a queen from the bugger race that survived and wanted to rebuild the bugger race to live in peace with the humans. This relates to our world today because it shows us that we should not stereotype against a group of people because even though some people are hostile it does not mean that every person with the same ethnicity is hostile.
B0013FBS20|4.0|the visual quality of this movie is excellent.the blu -ray format  is superior in everyway over the standard dvd format.i feel the movie's  story line could've been better developed and a better (ending was so  abrupt)ending.But it is an entertaining movie,nevertheless.i would  recommend it.the premise was good but just needed more development  to round out the story,to make it more believeable.enjoy!

0380799006|5.0|This is hands down the most helpful parenting book I have read.  It will not only help you understand why you may have experienced rivalry with your own siblings, it will help you prevent these same issues from injuring your own childrens' bonds.  The authors use support group participants' real-life examples to discuss how we, as parents, unknowingly label our children (He's our athlete, she's our artist, etc.), create unfair comparisons (Your sister ate all of her vegetables, your brother made an \\"A\\", etc.), become the referee in disputes rather than facilitating problem-solving, and many more.  Unlike many other parenting books available, this will leave you with specific guidelines and ideas that you can actually use and receive immediate results.
B000MR9D5E|5.0|this is literally the best documentary that i have ever seen.  and i watch a fair bit of docs.  i have yet to check it out in HD but HD planet earth would be the only thing that would top planet earth
B0002TKOYG|5.0|this is one of the best audio recordings of rhcp since slane castle.  the covers that they do especially \\"brandy\\" need to be heard.  the song \\"rolling sly stone\\" is personally one of my favorite peppers songs ever.  it was supposed to be recorded for their first album in 1984, it never got on and they played it on their by the way tour on the european leg.  it is amazing. get this disc.
0763637084|3.0|Get the non-pop up, the story is really wonderful and funny - not a boring read for mom and dad. I'm very disappointed, though; I love this book and we used to get it all the time from the library (non-pop up). We could only find the pop up hardcover online and it doesn't work well at all. The flow is hard to follow, too, and I'm always missing part of the story as I read, and having to go back.
B00151G08Y|5.0|After several weeks of listening this album gets consistently better. At first I was upset that they seemed to have lost their true essence of D&B. Yes, it is not like Hold Your Colour in the traditional D&B sense, but this album is truly original for its incredible hybridization of rock and D&B. I cant stop myself from rocking out to this album when it plays...in fact I SHOULD BE, and JUST WAS writing an important paper due tomorrow but when this album came on my random playlist, I had to just stop and give this review. The only real criticism I would have is that it feels like they tried to make some songs longer than they should have been. Every song is just about the same length, and it seems unnecessary in some of them.<br /><br />Heres a somewhat cheesy breakdown...<br /><br />From the very beginning the album throws you into an intense SHOWDOWN between what Pendulum is known for and what they are evolving into. It truly sends you into a DIFERENT realm of musical excitement and gives you anything but NIGHTMARES! Beautiful VISIONS overwhelm my imagination and keep my brain RUNNING to and from THE OTHER SIDE of Pendulum's musical prowess. The sheer MUTINY that they display in the face of unoriginality is enough to make me want to travel 9000 MILES to find another artist like them...*cough* i like GRANITE counter tops btw....anyways, this album is sure to cause quite a TEMPEST amongst the musical industry.
B001E75QGG|4.0|The Blu-Ray transfer looks gorgeous; the film's lavish visual effects practically jump off the screen.  Lots of cool extras, including timelines and historical notes.<br /><br />The story is great fun, and it's wonderful to see Karen Allen back in the action.  However, I will say that, more than any of the other films, you may need to leave any knowledge of you may have of the laws of physics at the doorstep.
B0013K6WLM|3.0|The Black Keys have ventured far from their break-out album The Big Come Up, and while some of the songs still rock, most of the album sounds over-produced.  The gritty, wailing guitar sound that makes the The Black Keys so great seems to have taken a haitus.  But, all that said, tracks 1 and 2 seems to be a step in the right direction, hopefully they'll see that for their next album.
1416955070|5.0|Wow!  I can't believe the people who are giving this book one-star!  I absolutely loved it!  I found it through Twilight Moms in March, read it and couldn't wait to get to the store to buy City of Ashes.  I think the characters are very evolved and have a lot of depth to them and the story is amazing.    I was looking for something to help deal with my Twilight addiction until Breaking Dawn came out and I was so glad to find this series.  But I think I just found another addiction!  And it helped to ease the pain of Breaking Dawn fail for me!    I would suggest that you go get these books as soon as possible!
B000W91RUG|5.0|This is one of the funnies shows to come along in a decade.  It's clever humor has me laughing again.  In a TV world that is full of \\"reality\\" everything and the occasional \\"safe\\" formulaic sitcom this show is a stand out.  It is fresh and different and the chemistry between the actors is great.
B0016Q2D5M|4.0|I am a fan of science fiction, especially the classical kind of Jules Verne, H.G. Wells and other European authors of the pre-Hollywood era.  I've read many of these books, and have watched almost all the English-language movie adaptations of said books, and I will say that this is the best adaptation of Journey to the Center of the Earth produced by Hollywood so far.  This version is not as faithful to the book's plot as previous versions.  But as a movie, it is by far the best, for the following reasons.  First of, the special effects are great and very realistic, which is a required of any sci-fi movie these days.  Second, the action and dialogue were actually quite believable.  Brendan Fraser actually played a half-serious role, and the movie, though funny, was not ridiculous.  The other two characters; the boy and the lady, came across well, and were cast well.  Last, there were no outlandish scenes involving far-fetched technology, or some long-lost underground tribe of humans.  This made the movie very believable.  All in all, quite good, and probably Fraser's best action movie in the past several years.
B001B7CNXI|1.0|I was extremely disappointed in this Blu-Ray disk.  Movie was very grainy and quite frankly I saw no improvement over the DVD version.  As for the movie, I adore Gong Li, and I wanted so much to like this movie, but it was terrible.  The movie was too long, filled with wooden acting and a very predictable plot.  Boring.
B001AEF6IQ|5.0|...that's why the show is called Torchwood.     \\"Torchwood: outside the government, beyond the police. Tracking down alien life on Earth, arming the human race against the future. The twenty-first century is when everything changes. And you've got to be ready.\\" - Jack Harkness    If you're looking for just a Doctor Who spin-off, try the Sarah Jane Adventures, but if you're looking for something a little darker, more drama, and a lot more interpersonal characters, then Torchwood is for you.    It revolves around Torchwood 3, based in Cardiff, which is set on a Rift in Time and Space. The job of Torchwood is to monitor this rift and seek out any aliens coming through before they get out into the general public.    Torchwood is run by Captain Jack Harkness, who many Doctor Who fans will remember fondly. Gwen Cooper is your lead into the world of Torchwood, and you learn about how it all works along with her. The story line between the characters are are deep and very complex. Love traingles, squares and pentagon's abound.    Now, a word of warning...there are homosexual relationships in this show. Could be because Jack, being from the future and an alien, doesn't see male or female, he just see's life form. If that bothers you, don't bother to watch. Again, this is not your average Doctor Who. This is Torchwood.
B001EOQWFI|5.0|This is my first written impressions of the movie (and blu-ray release) of Wall*E. I love this movie because of its details of environment and sound, lots of interesting and effective emotive characters, humor, cuteness, and central themes.  Combined with an engaging good story and eye-candy in computer graphics, it ranks up there with Toy Stories as my top animation films.  Wall*E is definitely my favorite film for 2008 and is my first Pixar blu-ray.<br /><br />Unlike the DVD and Blu-ray releases of Ratatouille (I have the DVD), the special features included with the 3-disc Blu-ray of Wall*E will keep you glued to the screen for hours.  So far, all the bonus features are in 1080p HD, many of which are 16x9 1.85.1 aspect ratio.  I watched the feature, \\"The Pixar Story,\\" with great interest and was delighted to see clips of previous Pixar films in HD.  There is a short scene of Star Wars in HD, too.  I can't wait until both Toy Stories are released in blu-ray.<br /><br />I had forgotten that Wall*E included an animation short.  I saw this film once in theater when it came out this past June.  Presto looks absolutely incredible in 1080p/24! It's also a fun and clever animation to watch.<br /><br />This release of Wall*E is well worth the money.  The picture and sound quality are excellent.  I will need to watch this film a few times to adjust my 5.1 speaker setup.  I have not looked at the digital copy on the 3rd disc, but will see if it works on my ipod nano.  I'm curious about the next Pixar release called \\"UP.\\"<br /><br />Update: Yep, Wall*E looks great on my iPod nano (though widescreen mode is a bit small and pan/scan mode cuts off the right/left portion of the movie when using my nano).  However, setting the nano to widescreen, TV out, compressed MPEG-4 copy of the movie is very watchable on my Sony HDTV.  The stereo sound is top notch, too.
B001GAPC1K|5.0|Iron Man is one hell of a fun ride.    Yes, The Dark Knight might be the better film, and yes it might be a little shallow sometimes, but Iron Man is still my preference.    Its a fun, enjoyable romp, that sets up the franchise.    The actual reason I wrote this review though?    This DVD is NOT region locked.    If your in the UK, you can play this Blu-Ray.  What does this mean?  No getting ripped off, no having to wait forever to get an ultimate edition over here, you can just order this one.
1596434252|5.0|I collect pop-up books and this is one of the best. It is a stunningly beautiful rendition of the English alphabet in pop-up form.  Each page is a delight.  Some pages combine letters such as \\"P\\" and \\"R\\" where the \\"R\\" is formed by adding a transparant page containing a diagonal line to the \\"P\\".  I was immensely pleased when I received this book.  I would recommend it to anyone who wants a particulalry clever take on the alphabet or to a person who would find satisfaction in owning a beautifully designed and executed book.

B0014DZ2VO|5.0|I set my expectations low for this one given the rather mediocre reviews and that seemed to work out quite well because I enjoyed it very much. It certainly is not without its flaws. I found the action to be a rather excessive and felt like telling the movie to please calm down and take a deep breath. Casino Royale had been a step away from the over the top action of the Brosnan films but Quantum of Solace seemed to be sliding back to those mind numbing, high octane days. I also wasn't fond of the way much of the action was filmed with the rapid cuts and close up action that's so popular nowadays. It makes things very difficult to follow as everything becomes a blur. On the other hand Daniel Craig is much more believable as someone capable of fighting multiple trained fighters than Pierce Brosnan or Roger Moore.<br /><br />Quantum of Solace delivers on all the Bond requisites. We have beautiful locations, particularly a lengthy stay in Italy, gorgeous women and spectacular stunts. The gadgets are gone but I'm ok with that one. I also have to give credit to the producers for some great casting. There have been complaints about the movie plot and I have to admit that after a single viewing I'm not sure I completely get the villains scheme. Actually I have to give the writers credit for making the scheme mirror actual real word situations. It seemed to be a commentary on the way multinational companies manipulate countries for their own financial enrichment. I don't think I'm really revealing anything to say that Bond is now facing a new SPECTRE like enemy in the secret organization Quantum but rather than issue ransoms to the world Quantum uses a much more clever and insidious means to extract wealth. I did find it odd that the front company was an environmental group called Greene Planet. Is this a commentary on environmentalists?<br /><br />With this movie the future of the Daniel Craig years is taking shape. Clearly there will be a continuing storyline with Bond battling Quantum and presumably working his way up the food chain. Quantum of Solace picks up just minutes after the close of Casino Royale and unlike previous Bonds there are frequent mentions of the prior movie including several conversations about Vesper Lynd. Mathis and Felix Leiter have both returned played by the same actors from Casino. As much as I loved the old Bond movies it was always jolting that Leiter and Blofeld were always played by different actors often appearing completely different from one film to the next. My suspicion is that the new movies will be much more diligent about continuity and I find that pretty exciting.<br /><br />The excuse I've heard is that the script of Quantum of Solace was rushed to get it out before the writers strike which would explain why the movie is so action heavy and ran a scant 105 minutes. Hopefully the next movie in the series will get a more well crafted script and things can calm down a bit. I'm sure all the complaints from reviewers will be heard loud and clear at Sony. The movie is a step down from the previous effort but it's still better than any Brosnan movie besides Goldeneye. It's just that it gets compared to Royale which was so good. At least it never loses its dignity and stays classy throughout which is more than just about any other action movies being produced nowadays. Being the third best Bond movie in two or three decades is nothing to be ashamedttling Quantum and presumably working his way up the food chain.

B000AP04FG|2.0|Ok to watch it while playing guitar or something else but to give 2 hours to this movie is not worthwhile. The plot is insultingly stupid but the action is fun.
B000002KKD|5.0|I don't know if the B-52's thought they'd ever be heard outside of Athens, Georgia.  But I'm so glad they were, and even if you don't like them, or think their music is too weird, an artist you do like may have been inspired by them including: John Lennon, who claimed that hearing this album made him want to record music again; and Kurt Cobain, who watched the B-52's on Saturday Night Live and was inspired.<br /><br />And what was inspiring about the B-52's? They sounded familiar, and yet were unlike any band before them.  Like the Cramps, the B-52's were high lords of low culture and were also influenced by 50/60's camp, surf and rockabilly music.  The B-52's played toy insturments.  They were fun, and they did it all on there own terms... for a while.  The guitar, though famliarly surfy, had only four strings which were tuned to some bizarre tuning.  And the guitar's rythym was... off the wall.  There's a depth to the musicality that might not be apparent to those who are not listening to the music.<br /><br />I had this tape as a kid and I listened to it so much that it became unlistenable; the tape ruined by so many plays.  Check out the ultra-catchy \\"52 Girls\\" it's my personal favourite, but it also best incorporates the unique sound that defines these early records.

B001DHXT20|4.0|A cross between King Kong and Jeckel & Mr. Hyde. Another fun escapism Marvel-comic hero. This one trys to be a love story; evil vs. good saga; part Bourne part Action hero. A little too many things but smartly made anyways. Tim Roth was miss-cast as the Villian; turned \\"creature\\" himself. Once again the \\"movies\\" go for a \\"name\\" instead of a better choice and more believable. Fun, but wait for the rental on T.V.

And the Golden Army looked like yellow bowling balls; take a lesson from \\"Lara Croft\\" or the \\"Mummy\\" movies for creepy ancient return from the dead monsters. Wait for a night when you are totally bored to rent this one.
B001DTPZNY|3.0|It was fun to see another \\"Indie\\" movie; but to be honest, Harrison Ford is getting a little \\"long in the tooth\\" to be believable in all the action. Shea LaBuf was fun cast as Indie's son, but being a biker-smartalek did'nt do well on him. He is much better playing the nerdie kid we've seen him as. Marrion  stole the show; she was great! Cate Blanchet, confusing . Who were the \\"bad\\" guys surpose to be? Very out of date. And the ending even more confusing; were they alien's? But I loved the final conclusion.

Reading it will give you the basic tools needed to cut through the crap and quickly dissect the debates on almost any of the inherently flawed economic policies which are squandering the wealth of the West and retarding the growth of developing nations.  Most of the policies we see proposed (and in effect) today fit the basic forms of those Hazlitt dismembered more than 60 years ago.    I was blown away by a single paragraph in chapter 5 which nailed the heart of the current housing crisis.
B0011TQLA2|3.0|A lot of hubub over this album.      Bodysnatchers is absolutely rockin', Jigsaw Falling Into Place is great, and the rest of the album seems to be music I can fall asleep too. Radiohead goes way too close to being Coldplay snoozer music with a few progressive sounds and occasional addition of drums. The Bends and OK Computer continue to be the best albums, but this one ain't bad...it just ain't that exciting either.
B00005Y7PS|5.0|Tony Martin will never be recognized as the talent he is no matter what. The songs on this album are all well written and get you into the story as it builds. The stories are told with a heavy Sabbath back drop including the thundering pounding from Cozy Powell throughout climaxing with Heaven In Black. It is not your typical Sabbath, being melodic without being mellow, and heavy with lyrical contant as well as blistering leads. Sometimes it sounds as if Tony Martin attempts to sound like Dio, but he also writes some great lyrics which all flow together to tell some deep nordic tales. Even the ballad \\"Feels Good To Me\\" has a certain heavy characteristic which draws you in to sing along with ....\\"If I never saw another night...If I never saw another day...\\" This album still feels good to me!
B001ECE6C6|1.0|I bought this cd today excited about a different Metheny collaboration, and I found it nothing but disappointing.  I am a HUGE Metheny fan (I own every one of his cds), but I cannot believe he did this with his music.  He and Anna Maria Joper have ruined his compositions; they sound like a beginner arranged them using the program Logic for the first time.    What is Lyle Mays thinking about this?  It is a Pat Metheny Group Production and some of the compositions are co-written by Metheny and Mays.  I hate this cd and the fact that I spent $15 on it.  It will be the last time I buy a Metheny cd without listening to it first.  I feel deceived.    Alfonso  PS:  I gave it one star only because I had to.
0765342294|5.0|Ender's Game is a great book for all ages and genders. This book is the story of a young boy, Ender, who is blessed with super human intelligence. He is taken to an area in space called Battle School where the government has bred super human commanders. As the boy grows, you go with him on his journey where the adults isolate him and destroys every last mental gate so that the government can use him as the ultimate weapon. This book is a great book for someone who doesn't like books that take their time. This book jumps right into the action and engrosses the reader through the whole story. From when Ender is a six year old boy trying to fight his way through simulation battles, to when he is twelve years old sending his army into a battle that would save the world. I this book think could be a considered a classic.<br /> Even though Orson Scott Card, a great Sci-Fi writer, has a great choice of words, sometimes his plots can become convoluted. Because he is trying to come up with a new world, parts of the book feel a little bit dense or overworked. In the parts where he is trying write about how Ender learns to fight and how he teaches others are almost too detailed. This wouldn't be a problem with the book since the rest of the book is fast paced. I enjoyed a book with a lot of plot, but, I think that he has created a world that is ingenious. You never feel that he is just rambling. We feel for Ender, even though he has been pushed beyond the brink, and feel he is still loveable and has a great voice.<br /> In the end, Orson Scott Card has found a way to revolutionize Sci-Fi books. He can explain his world in a way that is meticulous and perfectly crafted. This is a great book and can be enjoyed by everyone.
B001DHXT1G|5.0|There are tons of reviews about how this Hulk movie was all about big bangs and lots of action.  However, what has been ignored is that this film has a romantic heart that carries throughout the whole picture.  As a guy, I might have missed this if not for the tears of my wife while we watched this together.  She felt Bruce's turmoil and how lonely he was.  It is this part of the story that was most like the TV show.  Bruce is a man destined to be alone.  He runs from the military who want to use him as a weapon and runs from those he loves so that he doesn't hurt them.  The scenes where Bruce and Betty reconnect and even Betty and Hulk really touched my wife and won her over.  I probably would have missed it because of all the action, but there is a big green heart beating here that takes this movie to a whole new level.
B001DUJNGS|5.0|I love this album and recommend everyone to judge it for themselves.  This 2-CD set has some reminiscent material and some new sounding stuff... but it's all Enigma!
1400082773|5.0|I have rarely been so privileged to read a book such as DREAMS OF MY FATHER. Obama reveals his thought processes as he struggled to find his place in the larger sicial fabric. Were that all, this would not be so great a book. But, he describes his maturation in thinking as he interacted and learned from others. And, while personally growng, he was able to empathize with others from virtually all walks of life, to relate to them and to abstract the essence of their needs and being. Finally, he was able to integrate those observations into a larger vision of society and how to effect it in a positive way. All of this is written in the most compelling language.  He is a great and poetic writer.
B001ECE6C6|5.0|A serenely beautiful departure from Metheny's other works, Upojenie is rapidly rising to the top of my Metheny playlist.  Beautifully recorded, the vocals are mellow and soothing, especially after a long, frustrating day 'in the mines.'  Metheny arranged and played in almost everything here, and his touch is everywhere on the CD -- that's obvious.  If you need something meditative, mesmerizing and captivating to quell your jangled nerves, this may be the CD for you.  My wife even likes the mood this CD puts her in (i.e., romantic).  I paid a pretty price for the Polish version, but it was well worth it.

B0014DZ2VO|5.0|Time for a reality check.  As much as I love the old Bond movies, gone are the days of  a 22 MPH moon buggy chase, voodoo priestesses, X-Ray specs, laser beam watches that cut through solid steel walls, magnets that can stop a 45 cal. bullet, and single karate chops that reduce the bad guy to a lump of flesh.      People are far too savvy to buy this kind of stuff in a spy movie anymore. I think the Bond franchise has done a great job keeping Bond relevant and exciting.  This was a great movie with, yes a convoluted plot.  If you didn't get it, read the wikipedia plot synopsis and let me know if it still doesn't make sense.  I learned a long time ago you can't party before you go to a Bond flick or you won't get it.    If you still want Bond movies to include Jaws somehow biting a 2 inch steel cable in half, or Sheriff J.W. Pepper saying \\"Yo in a heapa trouble boy!\\" you better watch the old movies because those days are gone.
0783240236|4.0|[[ASIN:0783240236 The Birds (Collector's Edition)]]<br /><br />I saw this movie when I was just a little girl (probably about 6 years old), I probably snuck out of my room, and what a mistake that was, I was so scared! As a matter of fact, the next day when I heard the birds outside I accidentaly touched the iron and seared my thumb and finger to the iron!  So I wanted to see if it was as scary now that I am 46.<br /><br />Well I was not as scared, but it was still a very erie movie, and kind of strange.  The special effects for that time were pretty awesome.  The story dragged on more than I remember, and I would have preferred to see it in black and white as it was made, not colored in.<br /><br />The eyeball part is different, at least my memory tells me the eye ball was hanging out of the guys eye, not totally pecked out and gone. Over all, it was a great Alfred Hitchcock movie and would recommend for your viewing pleasure.
B000MXPE74|3.0|Costello Music is a great example of catchy, get up and sing guitar music. Choruses are meant to be sung en mass; verses are brief and don't get in the way of the choruses. It's fast, it's effective, it gets the job done. Think of it as a musical pick-me-up. It fades as it goes, and I think the later songs could have done with turning down the guitar a few notches, but it's a good album. Not great, but good. The best moment, it should be noted, is \\"Whistle for the Choir,\\" the album's one moment of rest.
B00005JLEU|4.0|This movie has kept my granddaughter mesmorized for hours on end.  She can't get enough of it.
B001EOQWEO|5.0|First, the feature; Wall-E continues Pixar's impeccable habit of making great movies. They slipped a bit with Cars, but many a studio would kill for Cars to be the low point in their filmography. Ratatouille and Wall-E makes the second time Pixar has released back-to-back masterpieces, and, I think, ultimately, Wall-E may prove their best film.    It is certainly the most unusual of the Pixar movies; The first thirty minutes or so are nearly a silent movie. The two main characters are machines who are capable of saying almost exclusively their own names and uninterpretable sounds. Yet somehow it works. The animation is spectacular, as always. Besides the technical aspects, how stunning it all looks (this movie makes the definitive case for upgrading to Blu-Ray, though I've not bought a Blu-Ray player and will be enjoying my copy on DVD), the movie excels in emoting through body language. Wall-E cannot speak, but his body moves, particular his \\"eyes,\\" in such ways that you always know exactly what he's feeling. It's stunning to watch. And that this movie is so unusual in some ways makes it Pixar's most essential movie. It does something very old in an entirely new way.    I could throw plaudits at the movie all day, but I would be remiss if I did not mention the packaging. The last two Pixar DVD releases have been a bit of a disappointment. The magnum opus was Monsters, Inc. The myriad bonus features were fascinating, engaging, and I still don't think I've watched all of them, though lord knows I've tried. Cars and Ratatouille were the only single-disc releases in the Pixar catalog, and their special features were lacking that certain something Pixar usually brings. I am beyond thrilled to report that the Wall-E 2-Disc set (the third disc contains the Digital Copy, and is not actually a DVD) is a return to fine form. The special features go in-depth about the making of this magnificent movie, and there's enough here to keep you watching for quite some time after themovie ends.
B001EYGOEM|4.0|Taylor Swift has been one of my favorite artists since the release of Teardrops on my Guitar and this has definetely been one of the most anticipated albums of the year for me. I have to say that i wasn't quite as impressed with this album as i was with the first one. There's not as much of a variety on this one as there was on the first one. My favorite songs are 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 10, and 13. Overall a good effort.
0740748475|5.0|The Complete Calvin and Hobbes is a great purchase. This massive set contains every C&H strip, with good printing quality, and the volumes are well-bound and sturdy. The intro written by Bill Watterson is an enjoyable read, and the strip is, of course, priceless. There's nothing like C&H, and there never will be again.    There are some glaring flaws, though, in both the printing and in the packaging. First, the strips aren't arranged in strictly chronological order. There are odd leaps and turn backs, mostly because the publisher elected to group Sunday strips. If the entire run of Calvin and Hobbes evened out to six weeklies and a Sunday strip, this would make some sense, but there are not always Sunday strips to end a week, and so sets of weeklies still end up split on opposite sides of the same piece of paper. It should have been in chronological order from start to finish.    The other complaint is that the covers and the box are made of a cheap material. It looks nice until it touches something, and then permanent marks are left. Also, the two pictures on the outside of the slipcase are pieces of paper that have been glued on. There's no reason those couldn't have been printed on. It would look nicer and last longer.    Still, a brilliant collection of a brilliant strip well worth your money.
B000002H1T|3.0|The Cars' Heartbeat City is indeed the sound of the Summer of 1984. And unfortunately many, many individual sounds on the album stayed there as well as they were almost dated by the end of that very Summer. The Cars constant employment of that weeks' sound gave much of the material on this album in particular a somewhat limited shelf-life. As so many synth sounds from this era didn't sound too amazing in the first place, it's pretty understandable that they didn't age too well. Which is a shame as the songs themselves are fully-formed and full of life with pretty good arrangements. I've constantly wondered what exactly what David Robinson's (now a businessman) thought process was and how could he possibly think that his drum sound was improving with each successive album by solely using electronic drums (on albums and live as well).    \\"Hello Again\\" sounds like Gary Glitter as performed by a bunch of tone-def session musicians. The song is great, but the choice of shrill keyboard parts leave much to be desired. And the Mutt Lange/Def Leppard \\"Hello\\"s in the intro are a bit much. \\"Drive\\" is a great song that can't be tarnished by bland muzak instrumentation - the chord sequence is perfect as is the arrangement. \\"You Might Think\\" is a good, fluffy song with, once again, keyboard parts that I've always found to detract from the overall song. Many of the non-singles (four out of ten tracks) are pretty forgettable and sound as if this is by design if not intention. \\"Why Can't I Have You\\" is a by the numbers synth-ballad with an ill-conceived synth-violin solo (it's actually an emulator but synth is a convenient term of reference).      The two knock-out moments for me personally are the title track which is a moody, warm and lightly emotive synth-heavy song. But because it is so understated and the choice of sounds on the synthesizer aren't seemingly attempting to win 'most obnoxious synth sound ever' the song is all the better for it. The vocals and guitar parts are purposeful and effective.  The other highlight is \\"Magic\\". Considering the first word uttered in the song is \\"Summer\\", it's not so ironic that this is a celebration-of-Summer song. It's probably one of my all-time favorite Summer songs and it was everywhere the Summer of 1984. From the bubbling keyboard intro to the chorused guitars and sweeter-than-sweet backing vocals. Perfect.    As everyone knows, and if you didn't know, this album did the business.  Six singles, most of them huge hits, platinum album many times over.  But what's funny is how smaller and smaller The Cars sound as band became, whilst individual instrumental parts simultaneously became less concise than before, the more successful they became. The bass, and guitars all but disappeared while awful drum-sounds, emulators, synthesizers and Linn drums dominated the proceedings. These are not the things that made The Cars interesting.     This a necessary part of The Cars puzzle (without the hit singles there'd be nothing of note here) and it's the only Cars album where the non-singles are forgettable. 'Shake It Up' is most similar to this in The Cars catalog but that album is much more worthwhile than this.  Whereas this album is an exercise in dated keyboard sounds trying to undo a few good singles and almost succeeding in doing so.
0307269752|5.0|This is an outstanding book for a reader who wants an intellectual murder story mixed with unusual historical Swedish commerce, family saga, fascism and corruption.  I thoroughly enjoyed this novel and as an American, I learned more than I thought I would about the structure of Sweden's system.<br /><br />The story revolves around Mikael Blomkvist, who although he is convicted of libel, is hired by the scion of the prominent Vanger family to solve a possible murder (many years prior) of his niece, Harriet Vanger.  The book contained a page of the family tree which I bookmarked separately as I need to keep referring to the vast family for clarification.<br /><br />Blomkvist is characterized a brilliant journalist and a ladies' man who is hardworking and determined to chronicle the murder and the Vanger biography.  The family is rife with selfish, crazy and egocentric people which makes the story interesting on every page.<br /><br />Paired with Blomkvist is Lisbeth Salander, a 24 year old, who had a deplorable childhood.  She is a brilliant investigator and computer hacker with a determined streak of violence.  She was a very believable character. I have known some young American women who came up through the foster system and her plight and anger seemed quite realistic to me.<br />In addition to the corruption that unfolds,  I was somewhat astonished to learn how many Swedish women are subjected to sexual assault.<br /><br />This is one of the best novels I have read in a long time.  The translation, I trust, is excellent.  It is very sad to know that Steig Larsson died so young.  He certainly was a gifted and brilliant novelist.  I am looking forward to the next releases of his books in the US.

B001BPJJ82|4.0|When I initially watched the film, I didn't like it very well.  I watched it a second time (approximately 1 week from the first viewing) and it was better for me.    I was anticipating a 'Disney-type' film with a dramatic twist, but find it better if I remove all expectations and simply watch it for what it is...    However, I wouldn't consider it a 'block-buster,' merely a film that is good from a 'b-list' perspective.    Cheers! ;)
0743298039|5.0|If I were to attempt a plot summary here, my guess is that many readers would be (not unjustifiably) put off by what seems to be a sensationalist, V.C. Andrews-ish, melodramatic series of coincidences, assumed identities, secret twins, incest, ghosts, and murder. I don't know if there's any way that a mere summary can do this book justice. Diane Setterfield's genius is that when you're reading \\"The Thirteenth Tale,\\" you become so wholly engrossed with the characters and the stories they tell that improbable events - which would make you laugh scornfully in the hands of any other author - instead seem to make perfect sense. Each new lurid detail only pulls you deeper into the story, eliciting very real sympathy for the characters living out this tragedy.    The framing device is rather straightforward - a famous author, whose life story has until now remained a mystery, has chosen on her deathbed to assign her biography to an amateur author, the daughter of a bookshop owner. We learn about Vida Winter's life as young Margaret Lea does - beginning, then middle, then end, we're informed firmly. As an unrepentant page-flipper who always peeks ahead to the end, this was enormously frustrating - but ultimately rewarding. Setterfield knows how to drop just enough clues and hints to keep us hooked, making the plot twist both a complete surprise and - upon reflection - perfectly obvious.    The pace does lag a bit about 2/3 of the way through. A subplot involving an orphan abandoned 60 years ago who befriends Margaret isn't fleshed out quite fully enough; I never cared about Aurelius quite as much as I did the other characters.  All minor quibbles in the face of a book that grabbed me fully, leaving me bereft and adrift when I was done. What to read next that can possibly compare? I will eagerly await future writings from Diane Setterfield.
B001F290E4|2.0|I love cover cd's that outshine the originals or take them to an entirley different sound.

Well, at least I still have his older, \\"good\\" stuff.

B00104QSOM|5.0|I had heard that There Will Be Blood was a very slow and long movie. I saw a preview on tv that intrigued me enough to take the time to watch it and I am glad I did. This is one of the best movies I've seen in recent memory. I enjoyed it from start to finish. Daniel Day-Lewis is an amazing actor. The movie is 2 1/2 hours long, but does not seem like it. I will definitely take the time to sit down and watch this movie again. My only regret is that I waited so long to watch it the first time.

B00129H7VS|5.0|Freedom isn't FREE!  This is a series that EVERY AMERICAN from the age of 14 on should be required to see. This series took my breath away the first time I saw it.  And now having it with the clarity of Blu-ray does so again.    It is as powerful a war drama as there has ever been.  The telling of the events from the actual GIs who were there adds tremendously to the accuracy and credibility of this drama from Easy Company's boot camp through the end of the war.  We owe so much to these valiant American's who put their lives on the line so that we could live ours to the fullest and have the freedom we so richly enjoy.  This series is very profound and presents the events in an accurate, believable, and an unapologetic manner and allows you, the viewer, to make your own ultimate conclusions.    I wish that this video series (and the John Adams series Also by HBO) was a viewing requirement in every high school American history class in the country.  I find it sad how historically ignorant the people of this country have become as OUR own history is being dumbed down in the school systems due to revisionists who want to distort the reality of our true history and the deeply founded beliefs of its founders.  I believe that it is a responsibility of every American to learn and know the TRUE history of AT LEAST this country and its people.  How can we possibly know where we are going if we don't know where we have been.  \\"Those who don't know their history are doomed to repeat it\\".  We have access to so much information between books, videos, and the internet that there is no excuse except for self-centered apathy for such ignorance.  I pray that this will not be said of our generation!
6305882592|4.0|I have no idea why I like this film.  A part of me wants a shower after viewing this and the other part of me is such a sucker for romance...a BIG sucker.

1400063515|4.0|\\"Lies, damned lies, and statistics.\\"  Nassim Taleb exudes a healthy disdain for traditional \\"Gaussian\\" statistics in his popular manifesto, The Black Swan.  Jaded and toughened by several years as a derivatives trader on Wall Street, Taleb emerged from the profession with unique insights on how the world is missing the boat on analyzing risk.  The book is certainly eye-opening, endeavoring to make its point in so many eclectic fashions that it's best consumed in small doses.  It's a bit like reading Soros.  The author doesn't pretend to toe the line on traditional perspective.  In fact, he embraces such a healthy admiration for himself and his contrarian idea that it pays to step back every few pages and contemplate his assertions rather than taking too much of it at face value.<br /><br />To his credit, Taleb makes some prescient comments in the book, originally published in 2007.  Undoubtedly it's become a more popular read today than it was back then, with the global financial crisis now dominating the headlines.  That footnote on p. 225 is a perfect example, in one fell swoop correctly asserting that Fanny [sic] Mae was \\"sitting on a barrel of dynamite\\", yet mis-spelling the company's name.  A bit of editorial sloppiness notwithstanding, the book also suffers from being too wordy, with the same point being drilled home in chapter after erudite chapter, as if the reader were being forced to write \\"I UNDERSTAND THAT KURTOTIC RISKS ARE REALLY HARD TO PREDICT\\" 100 times on the blackboard.<br /><br />I originally cracked open The Black Swan thinking that its lessons would be predominantly applicable to the world of investing.  That's not the case.  Although the author certainly made a killing as a professional trader, harvesting especially big gains during the crash of 1987 (see pp. 18-19 et al), he doesn't confine the black swan to the world of finance.  Far from it.  Sociology, economics, publishing, medicine, national security, and even the lowly turkey (see p. 41) - we all have plenty to gain by not losing sight of highly improbable risks.plenty to gain by not losing sight of highly improbable risks.

B001B7CNY2|1.0|There is no doubt that America was/is a great ally to the UK and their contribution in WW2 was outstanding.  However, this movie stretches to the extreme Hollywood's self given right to bend the truth as it depicts Bon Jovi and his US forces chums capturing the first Enigma machine, this despite the fact that it was actually the Royal Navy who captured the first Enigma on April 15th 1940.  This was of course three years before the USA joined the European conflict.  Shame on you Hollywood.    In 2006, screenwriter David Ayer admitted that U-571 distorted history and stated that he would not do it again.  Ayer told BBC Radio 4's The Film Programme that he \\"did not feel good\\" about suggesting Americans captured the Naval Enigma cipher rather than the British.  \\" It was a distortion...a mercenary decision...to create this parallel history in order to drive the movie for an American audience. Both my grandparents were officers in World War II, and I would be personally offended if somebody distorted their achievements.

B000UR366S|2.0|As an avid Joni Mitchell fan, I had been waiting with baited breath for this album to come out.  In fact, the day before its release, I was up until midnight so I could buy this cd at the first moment I possibly could.  So when I listened to this cd on the way to work, I was hoping it was sleep deprivation that prevented me from enjoying this album.  Sadly, after many, many listenings, I have to say that this is the worst album Joni has ever produced.  With its jaundiced view on the world, and rehashing that same sax sound heard on so many previous albums, this is truly disappointing.  In the past, even when she wrote about negative issues, there was a ray of hope, both lyrically and musically that came through.  I cannot say that of her newest work.  The only really enjoyable song is Hana, which also happens to be a retelling of a classic movie.  The other song about a movie(or play) is Night of the Iguana, which does not match the tone of the film, and just feels like a plot synopsis.

It's time to watch the end of the world, which is our fault of course, as RiffTrax Presents Bill Corbett and Kevin Murphy's razor-sharp political analysis of The Day After Tomorrow - which, by my reckoning, at least for today, may also be called Friday (day of the week may vary in your area; check your local calendar).<br /><br />Director Roland Emmerich lends his usual subtle style to this story of a world in which we should constantly feel guilty for driving to get the pizza instead of walking.  Dennis Quaid stars as hard-driven scientist Harrison Ford, who discovers that a humble meteorologist, given enough power, can kill us all.  Jake Gyllenhaaaal sizzles as the guy they get when Toby Maguire is busy, and his congenital smirk lights up the screen.  Ian Holm adds the weensy bit of English charm that makes the other performances go down like overdone rump roast.  An ethnically balanced mob of nobodies rounds out the cast, but a special mention is merited for Kenneth Welsh, who plays a Cheney-esque Vice President so bilious, so bitter and acrid, that his performance actually eats a hole in the floor.<br /><br />Enjoy safely - and remember that downloading RiffTrax actually helps to save the environment!  As soon as we figure out how, we'll get back to you.
0061537934|3.0|The story is touching, minus the car-racing, but I must have been moved by the picture of the dog on the cover and forgotten how much I dislike anthropomorphizing when I chose this book at the library.  I love animals, respect animals, which is why I don't think it's cute or endearing to read about, or watch movies, other than animated, where animals speak as though they were human. That's just my opinion, which is why the book didn't speak to me.  Having the dog tell the story threw me off balance...it didn't feel right, as beloved as the dog was.

0446579939|5.0|The Lucky One is another great love story by Nicholas Sparks. In this book, Sparks creates a love triangle between Beth, the single mom, Logan, the Iraqi war vet, and Clayton, the ex-husband to Beth.    Clayton is a horrible man and father, and when he thinks Beth might become involved with Logan, he threatens to destroy them. The ending is quite suspensful and satisfying. I do think too much of the middle is associated with Logan and Beth falling in love. At times it became quite tedious.    Overall, this is one of Sparks' best books and I recommend to anyone.

B00139W3NE|3.0|\\"The Golden Compass\\" made a decent fantasy movie.  Most of the characters in it were very good (I found Lee Scoresby and Iorek Byrnison to be especially likeable).  It also had a very unique environment that departed from the normal medieval-ish confines of the fantasy genre.  Unfortunately, the story in it seemed quite predictable and uninspiring.  I never found it terribly exciting.  It held my interest the entire time, but I don't see myself standing in line to wait for the sequels.  \\"The Golden Compass\\" is a good work to have in your fantasy collection, but there are many better works of fantasy out there.
B001GJOL22|3.0|Rush is one of the greatest rock bands ever (hello Hall of Fame! Rush should be in the Hall of Fame by now) and I can't wait to pop these discs into my DVD player, IF I don't scratch the discs' surfaces. This has the same horrible packaging as Cheap Tricks' new \\"Budokan!\\" box. The CDs are incredibly snug in cardboard slits, all in a flimsy package. No clam shell case or even slimline jewel cases here. Just a flimsy cardboard package with no trays whatsoever, so every time you do get the discs out, they will scratch, no matter how careful you are. It's frustrating that labels keep having ANTI-JEWEL CASE FEVER and keep issuing things that will scratch after just a few days. Bring back the jewel cases, please. Which is worse for the environment, stacks and stacks of these flimsy cardboard/slit packages and the CDs/DVDs they scratch piled high in landfills, or jewel cases in our homes?    Again, I am a massive Rush fan. I just hate the storage presentation in this case.  :(
B001DHXT20|1.0|I'm sorry folks, this one was just awful. The previous release, starring Eric Bana was by far a more finely crafted presentation of this story than this one.

I was severely disappointed.

B001DXS4E2|4.0|I bought this set largely due to my interest in seeing a \\"classic\\" B&W film in faux color.<br /><br />Some B&W films (such as \\"Citizen Kane\\", \\"King Kong\\", and almost anything film noire) were conceived in and for B&W, and should not be converted to color. Comedies and musicals are a different matter.<br /><br />Until recently, attempts to \\"colorize\\" B&W films have been barely acceptable at best, and utterly putrid at worst. Not only were the colors poorly chosen, but medium-to-fine image details remained in B&W.<br /><br />The older colorizing systems were analog. The ability to digitally dissect each frame into millions of pixels now makes it possible to do just about anything to the image, limited only by time, patience, and money (of course).<br /><br />The conversion is done by Legend Films, which has colorized a number of Shirley Temple movies, and (unfortunately) \\"It's a Wonderful Life\\". (It's a dark drama about American values, and should remain in B&W.)<br /><br />The results are remarkable. If you'd never seen a Technicolor film, you'd think \\"Holiday Inn\\" was shot in color. The colors are (mostly) well-chosen, * and _everything_ in a scene is colored, even the fruit in a background bowl, or the fine details in the wallpaper. (Once a key frame has been hand-colored, computer software does most of the work of applying the color to subsequent frames.)<br /><br />The problem is that many viewers _do_ know what Technicolor looks like. It's somewhat disturbing to watch a realistically colored B&W film that _does not_ have the high contrast and extreme saturation of Technicolor. But B&W was lit differently -- even _costumed_ differently -- from color, so altering the image to match Technicolor's rendering would result in even greater changes than those brought about by colorization.<br /><br />Other than the generally appealing color, the only good thing about this film is Fred Astaire's dancing (though Der Bingle sings well, with less of his trademark crooning than usual). There are two classic sequences, one with firecrackers, the other in which he dances drunk. The rest of the film is little more than a showcase for a dozen Irving Berlin songs, none of which is bad, but only four of which are standards.<br /><br />It's a boring, almost tedious film. (Maybe I'm just getting old.) The plot revolves around the typical love triangle (which becomes a rhombus), which is worked out so mechanically, and with such a lack of wit and genuine humor, that the viewer really doesn't care. (Twelve years later, \\"White Christmas\\" would rehash the same plot devices in a not-dissimilar story, with the same humorless and irritating results.) I'd _like_ to give \\"Holiday Inn\\" three stars, but I'm giving it four, simply because of Astaire's work. Heck, Astaire \\"dances\\" almost every time he _moves_.<br /><br />For those wondering why the animated turkey is confused about which Thursday is Thanksgiving... Roosevelt had moved Thanksgiving to the third Thursday of November (from the fourth), in the hope that the week-longer holiday season would help retailers. People didn't like it. Now that the holiday season starts in late August (at Costco, anyway), it seems rather quaint.<br /><br />Viewers with children should be warned that this film includes an embarrassing black-face number (which, as another reviewer pointed out, is mistakenly rendered as \\"brown-face\\", despite Bing Crosby having applied black burnt cork in the preceding scene!).<br /><br />* Skin tones are spot-on and vary appropriately for each character, but hair colors don't look quite right, and Fred and Bing's hairpieces have never been more-visible. Fred's heavy makeup is rendered more-visible, his face sometimes resembling the Rankin-Bass puppet. The tainted peach preserves Bing gives Fred are about the right hue, but not sufficiently saturated.ecrackers, the other in which he dances drunk.

B001ED7C58|4.0|I'm not really a fan of \\"Bella's Lullaby\\". Like other reviewers have pointed out, this is supposed to be a piano only piece, not played by a full orchestra.   I initially thought the other songs seemed a little angsty and not in step with the book but then I had to remember that this is a love story set amongst teenagers or \\"sort of\\" teenagers. I would have eaten this soundtrack up when I was that age (heck I still am sort of). It's pretty emo with all the slow \\"no one understands me\\" type songs but I still like it.  I was listening to it while walking my dog and as a fellow Western Washingtoner, the dreary tunes really match the weather here.

B00005JLWN|5.0|I was skeptical at first when someone suggested this movie and I was hooked after watching the opening fight/gun scene. I liked it better than The Matrix as there are no crazy special effects and people floating in mid-air, etc. Another Christian Bale DVD added to the collection. Taye Diggs is a bit of a tool in this movie but did a swell job in a supporting role. Shipping was superfast btw, especially me being overseas an all....kudos to Amazon!!! :D
B0013K1ALE|5.0|Whether you're a Led-Head like me or just a casual Zeppelin fan, this is mandatory viewing material.  It's undoubtedly one of the finest guitar performances ever caught on film.  Ever.  The things Jimmy pulls off are amazing.  With this DVD you get to see Led Zeppelin all at the height of their creativity, talent and ability.  I was a little surprised when I first realized that the newly included songs that were left off the original motion picture were placed on a separate disk and not inserted into their respective places in the concert film.  But then I read that due to legal reasons, they weren't allowed to alter the original format of the film...only remaster the sound and images, but not mess around with the order of songs.  So they had to put those other songs from the NY concerts on a separate disk.  No biggie, at least you now have them all.  The Ocean, Celebration Day and others!  Some cool extras that I hadn't seen before.             Some people who don't understand Led Zeppelin have complained that the live versions don't sound like the studio versions.  However, Led never tried to reproduce that sound.  They played these songs differently every night.  Another complaint is that some say Zep live is self-indulgent.  It's not.  Per Jimmy Page, Led Zeppelin live allows for all four members to take their turn in \\"steering the ship.\\"  In this manner, it's actually very generous to the other members and not selfish. What else can be said that hasn't already been said by thousands (millions?) of other Zep fans.  This concert is tremendous and the level of musicianship is awe-inspiring.  And why wouldn't you want to see Jimmy at his height, playing his double-neck Gibson plus his famous Les Pauls!  If you like rock music, you've got to have it.

I have to say the ending was a bit hard to swallow but not all books end on a happy note and who knows what's in store for us in the 4th book.  I don't want to give anything away but I really hope that things can work out for Rose in a happy way but that might just be impossible now.  How long do I have to wait for the next book?  However long it is will be too long I can say for sure.  If you haven't read any of these books I suggest you read books one and two first.  Those of you who have read them - don't wait to go out and get Shadow Kiss - you won't be sorry.

B00009NHC5|4.0|Based on the play by Frederick Knott, 1967's WAIT UNTIL DARK was very much \\"the\\" thriller of the era, a shocker that set audiences screaming--particularly in the film's final ten minutes, when cinema lights were lowered to the legal limit, placing both characters and audiences in near total blackout for the the movie's climax.  The whole thing was a huge success, and it copped Audrey Hepburn still another Academy Award nomination as best actress.<br /><br />Hepburn plays Susy Hendrix, a blind woman living with husband Sam in a New York apartment.  Sam has recently come into possession of a doll which he later mislays--but unbeknownst to Sam and Susy the doll contains heroin, and three criminals set out to recover it.  With Sam lured away for the night, the three attempt to con Susy into finding the doll and turning it over to them.  But Susy is swifter on the uptake than they anticipate, and she uses her blindness as a weapon against her tormentors in an effort to escape them.<br /><br />The stage play presents Susy as a strong, sexy, and clever woman who fights like hell; the film, however, presents her as somewhat timid and vulnerable.  The result is very much a star-vehicle for Audrey Hepburn, who delivers a powerhouse performance--but the change in the character has the effect of rendering the center hour of the film a bit slow.  Still, WAIT UNTIL DARK has a truly memorable first and last half hour and a truly disturbing performance by Alan Arkin, who creates one the most truly evil characters ever seen on screen.  The supporting cast is also quite fine, featuring Richard Crenna, Jack Weston, and (the only cast member to repeat her stage role for the film) Julie Herrod.<br /><br />Seen today, the performances sometimes seem a bit over the top and the film has moments of accidental camp--but it remains an effective thriller, and Audrey Hepburn fans will enjoying seeing her in this somewhat unlikely role.  The DVD includes a short documentary that features producer Mel Ferrer and actor Alan Arkin.  The print is very good, indeed borderline pristine.  And yes--you really should watch this one in the dark.  Recommended.<br /><br />GFT, Amazon Reviewerlan Arkin.  The print is very good, indeed borderline pristine.

1594201927|4.0|The Ascent of Money: A Financial History of the World by Niall Ferguson in one of the most timely books of the year.  Appearing as it does in one of the largest and far reaching financial debacles of the modern world, one has to wonder if the timing is just coincidence or whether the financial gods are just having a quiet laugh.<br /><br />As an aside, if you remember anything from your Money and Banking course you may have taken in college, then some of this material will be familiar.  What is new, and certainly worth the cost of the book, are the interesting historical connections that Ferguson manages to create between the topic of money and events that have played out throughout much of recorded history.  To call these connections interesting or eye-opening is a gross understatement.  For the historian, regardless of whether you are a professional or amateur, the information provided by Ferguson is nothing more than astounding.<br /><br />The word credit has its root in the Latin word \\"credo\\" or \\"belief\\".  The very act of taking money in payment for some delivered product or service is an act of faith.  The faith part comes in believing that the \\"money\\" received can, in- turn, be used to buy some other product or service.  It doesn't matter what we use for money.  Money could be anything we place value on from colored stones, sea shells, precious metals, gems, or simply financial credits.  It helps if the \\"money\\" is easily carried which makes precious metals (gold and silver) such a convenient commodity and why we don't carry around bales of cotton or kegs of wine (but they have worked in ages past).  Of course, financial credits, little electronic binary 1's and 0's, are best of all, but, as with all other forms of money, require faith.  All of this is truly astounding when you look at commerce world-wide and realize the underpinnings are so simple.<br /><br />Ferguson's The Ascent of Money reminds me so much of Fernand Braudel's Civilization and Capitalism: 15th - 18th Century, especially volumes 1 (Structures of Everyday Life) and 2 (Wheels of Commerce).  Like Braudel, Ferguson's words are enlightening and surprisingly useful in today's world.  Simply understanding how the world functions is worthwhile knowledge and Ferguson helps provide that knowledge.  Lets face it, trading stock today isn't all that different than trading stock in 17th century London or Copenhagen at its most fundamental point.  The Ascent of Money is written for the lay reader.  You don't need to be a financial genius to enjoy this book.  Well researched with terrific notes.<br /><br />I highly recommend The Ascent of Money by Niall Ferguson even if you don't have much more than the cost of the book.  It'll be money well spent.ially volumes 1 (Structures of Everyday Life) and 2 (Wheels of Commerce).  Like Braudel, Ferguson's words are enlightening and surprisingly useful in today's world.

B001F290E4|4.0|This album raises so many questions. Has Seal gone too far in recording this soul album?  Should anyone attempt to hang with the greats?  Or does this album continue the grand tradition of reinterpretation, reinvention, and re-emergence of greatness?  Is Seal re-inventing himself?  Or is this a love letter, and nothing more? I'm not sure, but the moment that I put this on the player, I had to stop what I was doing and examine all these questions, because the music is just magical.      First, lets start with the good: Seal's voice, the production, and the general desire to make this album great.  Seal approaches this music, which he clearly loves, with absolute conviction.  He has obviously listened to Sam Cook albums until his ears bleed, and much of his impeccable phrasing is owed to his understanding of the master.  Seal's voice is a good soul voice--coming in this setting somewhere between Terrence Trent D'Arby (and I mean that in a good way) and Cook himself.  Pretty exalted territory, if you ask me.  Nothing is mannered, everything is heartfelt.  He uses his voice in all its smoky, melodic, deep, raspy voice to find his way around this music with the air of a man who really has lived in it for a long time.  This is Soul music, in every sense of the musical terminology.    The production is excellent.  His producer loves this music as much as Seal does, and the instrumentation is spectacular.  Beats are deep and meaty, grooves are funky or sentimental as required, and the strings drip emotion--and yet, it somehow doesn't go over the top.  This is exactly what you want from a soul song festival.  When you listen to this album, it is practically impossible not to a)sing along, b)say ridiculously romantic things to the person that you love, and c)reach for your Sam Cook/Otis Redding/Wilson Pickett albums when this one is over.  There are moments when Seal is so deeply within this music that you can't believe that he isn't of the era from which many of these songscome himself.    This album really deserves 4.5 stars, but Amazon won't let us do that, and it isn't really a 5 star record, so I gave it four.  So why can't I give this album 5 stars?  Everything in this album begs comparison to the authentic article.  When I hear this album, I love it--I'm singing along, humming, tapping my toes, but I just can't wait to get back to the original records themselves.  Maybe this is the highest praise possible, but maybe this really is just a karaoke album as someone else has declared.  I'm not certain.  Also, I'm not really sure that the world needed another cover of Ben E. King's \\"Stand by Me\\", however good it may be.    If you love Seal, you are probably going to be confused by this one--it bears so little relation to the music that he usually puts out that you won't know exactly what to do.  If you love soul music from its golden age, you are going to adore this album, or you will find it blasphemous--I'm not sure which.  I'm going with love for myself, for now, but only time will tell if these interpretations become as deeply ingrained in my psyche as the original songs have.  If you are willing to take a little chance on a great time, then you won't be disappointed.  If you bought, and loved \\"Am I Not Your Girl\\" by Sinead O'Connor (an album that bears no musical resemblance to this one) then you are the target audience--one who is willing to listen to a singer that you love interpret great old tunes.      Oh, and don't forget to pick up candles, wine, and something involving oysters on the way home when you buy this album.  Something tells me that Soul on the CD player may lead to some pretty romantic evenings.

B001F7MSFM|2.0|I purchased Hellboy II after reading a number of the reviews at Amazon.  The first flick was enjoyable and I thought the second would be better.  Turns out I was wrong.  The special effects were generally good and the action sequences fair to good with the fight scene between the dark elf and HB at the end the most enjoyable.  The exception is the an early scene in which HB and crew try to fight off thousands of tiny fairies with single shot pistols - the only victims of the fairy mass attacks were the non-essential characters which makes the fight seem contrived  HOWEVER the main problem with HBII is the dialogue which is simple and insipid and utterly lacking in imagination - the humor aims for the lowest common denominator and at times lapses into slapstick - poorly done slapstick at that. My advice - do not buy this movie before you screen it.     Glenn

I absolutely love this CD-I play it almost every day.  Of course, most of the songs are love songs, with the kind of words women want to hear.  This is a \\"sittin' on the back porch, in the evening, with a glass of lemonaid\\", CD.

So, a few months later we found it and we've been reading it most every night since.   As a result of reading this book my son now gives his sister a bottle of water in the afternoon (with just a little assistance), brushes her hair in the morning and is constantly telling people he's a big brother now.   He really related to the story and it seemed to help him understand a little better what had changed in terms of his role in the family.   We're about to move on to My Big Boy Potty now!!

B000OPPBEQ|5.0|I give this product 5 stars for one main reason, it is truly the \\"Ultimate\\" Matrix collection. I come from the standpoint of being a tremendous fan of the first movie - The Matrix - and somewhat disappointed with the last two with first viewing. In all honesty, the second two movies will never live up to the first, but they are enjoyable on their own merits.<br /><br />For those wondering about the quality of the Blu-Ray conversion, I can only express complete praise for the picture quality. All three theatrical releases and the Animatrix are now in full 1080p, and if I didn't know better I would swear that the films were all shot using the most advanced technology available today.<br /><br />The packaging is definitely commensurate with the cost of the product, and the inclusion of the first Matrix in a digital copy is a nice bonus (be aware, however, that it is only the first Matrix you are getting in a digital copy).<br /><br />Overall the product lives up to its name and I am very satisfied with my purchase.

1595141715|4.0|Have you ever found an unexpected package on your doorstep? How exciting to get a surprise, right? Well, for Clay Jensen, this package isn't what he hoped it would be. When he opens it, he finds cassette tapes and a note. The really scary thing is that these tapes have been left for him by a dead girl, Hannah, who committed suicide just a few weeks ago. Pills, they said. But why did she kill herself?  She explains who is responsible for what she has done -- in her own words on the tapes, she gives 13 reasons why -- and they all have names. Despite being horrified at what he might hear about himself and the others on the tapes, he forces himself to listen to them. Along the way, following the map included with the recordings, he finds himself both excused and also held accountable. What Clay hears that night changes him forever.  Recommended!
B001DHXT2A|5.0|If youre a lifelong comic book fan like i am, i can definitely tell you that Louis Letterier's reinterpretion of the Hulk mythos is much better than the 2003 Ang Lee version. Dont get me wrong, in many ways the 03 film has many admirable qualities, first of all Lee's dealing with the psychological underpinnings of Bruce Banner's conflict with his father, as well as the idea of the creature already inside of Bruce due to unethical experimentation by his scientist father (trying to create a perfect being), yet these story constructs can be found in the MARVEL Hulk stories of the last decade....however under Letteriers and Edward Norton's soulful, pathos driven portrait of Banner/Hulk, we are given a more streamlined, less angst ridden/more action driven story that still hints at psycho drama but in a way gives greater clarity to the tragedy of Banners plight....as for the villian of the piece we have the Abomination, one of the Hulk's greatest and most powerful adversaries, very well played by Tim Roth, William Hurt does wonders as General Ross although its Norton who truly drives this film as the tortured Banner...he really grasps the pathos of the character much like Bill Bixby did in the 70s series, you feel for him....without giving the story away, to those who thought the 03 film was too overblown, this is the Hulk comic fans know and loved for 40+ yrs, and the added elements of the beloved 70s tv series are here in full view (youll know em when you see em)....the dvd itself is fine, especially when you discover in the special features section the comic inspiration of one of the more touching moments in the film between the Hulk and his love, Betty Ross....my only complaint is the digital copy to be downloaded for your PC...why give me that if i  already have the actual dvd anyway, but if you want a copy of the film for on the go, i guess its ok...otherwise a good product for a fun film, grab it.
B001L8FB4K|4.0|(Not that there's anything wrong with cliffhangers.)<br /><br />In this one, the Winchester brothers encounter Anna, a woman who is, as Dean points out and I paraphrase, \\"tuned in to Angel Radio.\\" Anna can hear the angels talking, and she's hearing all this chatter about a coming apocalypse. She also hears a lot about Sam and Dean (aka \\"THE Dean,\\" a label that makes Dean just a wee bit uncomfortable and makes Sam roll his eyes, since he's not a fave of said angels), and because she can hear these angels, she's become someone the demons want to have in their possession (what better than your own personal \\"radio\\" to tell you what God's angels are planning?) and the angels want to kill (what's worse than someone who can reveal all your plans to the dark side?).<br /><br />The part of this episode that I really want to see expanded out is the encounter Dean has with Alistair, who apparently had a mighty fine time torturing Dean in Hell. Hmmm. . .I want the rest of this story.<br /><br />As I think I've mentioned in at least one previous review somewhere, Jensen Ackles is kicking acting bohiney this year (he did a mighty fine job last year, too), and it's good that his time in \\"the pit\\" is finally being addressed because if anyone can blend angst, humor and soul-crushing pain in one episode, it's Ackles.<br /><br />Good one!

B001ED7C58|4.0|Being a huge fan of the books, I expected different songs on this than what there is. Especially, when on Stephenie's website, she has playlists for all of the books. I guess since I listened to her playlists, I expected some of those songs to make it to the CD, and none of them did. So I was kinda surprised by the song choices. But, most of the songs are pretty good. Paramore, Muse, Linkin Park, Collective Soul, and Rob Patterson's songs are probably the best ones. The Black Ghosts \\"Full Moon\\" I didn't like at first, but it grew on me. Mutemath, Perry Farrell, and Blue Foundation's songs, I didn't really like, and I didn't think they really fit with the books. Carter Burwell's \\"Bella's Lullaby\\" was a big disapointment. If you read the books, you have a certain sound in your head that you expect for the song. This isn't it. In the book, it's strictly a piano played song that Edward always hums to Bella. Carter Burwell's song is played with more than one instrument, and I can't imagine it being hummed. Nor does the song have that feeling of the love between Bella and Edward. The song is probably one of the most important songs on this album, because it was really major in the book, and it just didn't cut it. I would still reccomend it to Twilight fans, but would say to expect to be a little disapointed.
B001EYGOEM|2.0|This album is a bunch of tween gossipy little tales about ex-boyfriends and she doesn't even sing it too well. Have you ever seen her in a live concert...ugh! It's amazing to me that all of the major music pubs are so gushing over this, I guess if you move enough units you are an artist. Case in point: TS, Carrie Underwood and Jonas Bros.
0451191153|2.0|My first thought while reading this book was \\"Why does Rand hate women so much?\\"  There does seem to be a misogynistic theme throughout the text, which is unfortunate because the story is pretty decent.  Like \\"Atlas Shrugged,\\" the characters here are one-dimensional and not terribly interesting, but Rand writes some good descriptions and the plot is good enough to make you want to finish it.  Even though it's clear what her philosophy is in this book, she doesn't beat you over the head with it nearly as much as she does in her other fiction books.  That said, you still do get the sense that if you don't agree entirely with how Rand feels about certain things (like, say, the arts), then you are an idiot and are part of the problem.  Some authors are masters of subtly, but Rand isn't.  She's about as subtle as a picture book for toddlers.  If you can put up with this style of writing, then the book shouldn't be a problem.  If you like shades of grey and think that the world doesn't exist solely in black and white, you might want to skip this, along with \\"Atlas Shrugged.\\"
B0008KLVG4|5.0|When future generations examine the Steven Spielberg canon, three motion pictures will stand out: \\"Schindler's List\\" (1993), \\"E.T.\\" (1982) and \\"Jaws\\" (1975), the director's breakthrough thriller. More than 30 years later, the film remains a textbook example of storytelling and characterization - somehow managing to transcend Peter Benchley's source material. Roy Scheider, Robert Shaw and Richard Dreyfuss make a formidable ensemble while Spielberg keeps a tight grip on the watery suspense. No matter how many times you see it, \\"Jaws\\" still packs a powerful cinematic punch. Far superior to the contemporary Hollywood blockbuster.
B001BPJJ82|5.0|Blu-ray is a great thing; the image is crisp and beautiful. However, up to this point, I had only seen one thing that I would say had to be seen in blu-ray. That was Planet Earth. The Fall is now the second. This is one of the single most beautiful films you will ever see.
B0014DZ2VO|5.0|I just got back from Quantum of Solace and was hugely impressed. Most fans out there complain that it lacked the style and charm of Casino Royale. Yes Quantum of Solace is different, but in a good way. The thing that made the movie for me was particulary Daniel Craigs performance. He is much different from Sean Connery, but I think he is the best since Sean Connery. He is very gritty and has some incredibly memorable action scenes. The action also delivered. The special effects were great but not only that, the stunt work was also well done. This is deffinitly the Bond movie with the most action and with the shortest running time. The movie in total without the end credits was only 1 hour and 42 minutes. It seemed the right length though because if they made it too long, it could have turned out bad. The plot in Quantum of Solace is pretty well writen. James Bond is trying to seek out and get revenge for his love in Casino Royale, Vesper. She is out to see who is out behind Mr. Whites organization. The leader of it all is someone named Dominate Green who wants to take over the water supply in the world. The Bond villain is threatining enough and should do well. Alongside Bond is Mathais who actually returns from Casino Royale and is seeking to help Bond, the Bond girl named Camillie who is also seeking revenge on the same organization, and another Bond girl who is there only very briefly who is Agent Fields. Her goal is to bring Bond back to London, she was sent by M. M back at MI6 doesn't know if he can trust Bond and says he is motivated by revenge. The plot does go a little off topic sometimes, but it still does work. I thought that overall the action was spectacular and the film never slowed down. There is usualy another action scene every 10-20 minutes. It went by very quickly and I was surprised that is wasn't as long as Casino Royale. What is also weird is that at the very ending of the movie they did the gunbarrell sequence instead of doing it at the beggining. It kind of woke up the audience a bit when the classic Bond theme started playing. I was relieved that they didn't take it away, especially since they took away the famous line Bond, James Bond. That is my only gripe with the film. Most of the cast returns from Casino Royale and still do their parts just as well as they did in Casino Royale. So all of these things make Quantum of Solace just as good as Casino Royale. It has great action, acting, special effects, and a story that isn't the best, but still does well make Quantum of Solace a must see movie for Bond fans. It doesn't have the classic line that everyone knows and love, but it is still Bond, James Bond.
B001DHXT1G|3.0|I purchased this at Wal mart and when I viewed it on my blu ray player I was surprised that the colors weren't vivid, they looked dull (might have been my disc).  The movie was good, but I was extremely disappointed with the color on a blu ray disc compared to my others.

B0018OAPAW|2.0|Went to the BX a few weeks ago and bought this with Metallica's Death Magnetic, excited to see a new Offspring offering.  I pop in the CD and talk about disappointment.  I figured that maybe this CD would grow on me like Splinter did.  When I first heard Splinter, I hated it, but actually was able to tolerate it after repetative listening.  I thought this CD was going to be like that after a few listens- because we all know it's incredibly unfair to give low marks on anything based on just a casual listen or two.    What on earth happened to this band?  What happened to the fast riffs, the cool bass or drum intros, the music that got your blood pumpin' and your fist shaking angrily in the air?  What happened to the angst that made the Offspring the Offspring?      The impression I received from this cd was that this is the retarded love child of Linkin Park and Green Day.  I'll come out bravely and say that I do like those bands' music.  I do.  But when I purchase an Offspring CD, I want to hear the Offspring.  Now, when I want Ignition, or the Self Titled, or Smash or Ixnay, I'll bust 'em out.  The disappointment primarily came when I read some reviews saying it sounded like a combo of Ixnay and Smash.  This CD is NOTHING like those two let me tell you!    I think the biggest travesty of this album is what it's doing or going to do to long time listeners and how much fair weather fans will come out and play.  I have listened to the Offspring since about '92 and I guess the good thing about this is since Metallica tossed Bob Rock, I've been able to get back to my roots!  Throw them devil horns in the air!  Master!      But in all honesty though, I pray that the Offspring make one more cd- that this is Offspring's St. Anger and the next CD will be their Death Magnetic- the Offspring can't end like this- they just can't.    I won't even touch sound quality- I'm no audiophile, so there is no room for my critique there.  The beef of the review is that the first few songs are what's supposed to sell the album- it's supposed to dictate the flow and get the listener digging the album.  As a long time Offspring lover, I found it extremely difficult to listen to the first few songs.  Smash was nearly a spiritual experience- this was a painful and cringing experience if I ever heard of one- it was like a really bad acid trip let me tell you.  Just do not buy this- unless you're in the mood for flavor of the week nonsense.    Dex, Noodles and the rest of the Offspring- I wish yall would read and heed the pains of your fans- I know, I know- make the music you want to hear- but it would be nice to have a glimpse of what used to be, instead of washing your hands of it for good.  It's hard to be talking about Molotov Cocktails and Beheading your girlfriend and the LAPD this far into the game- but there's so much that famous Offspring attitude can be applied to with the way society is going right now.      This was a very hard review to write- I have a slim hope that if the Offspring record again, that they learn from the several falls of this album.

B0006Z2KIY|5.0|I watched this movie again on cable for the umpteenth time recently, and I just have to comment on the one editorial review by Bruce Diones of The New Yorker:    He says \\"the film is as bland and sentimental as a greeting card.\\"    Mr. Diones clearly is not in possession of a beating heart in his chest.  If he has been so lucky as to have a woman love him, I feel sorry for her.  And if that sounds harsh, then so be it.    This film delivers on so many levels.  It is obviously an incredibly romantic story - as others have noted, the chemistry between Gosling and McAdams was fabulous (and of course we found out subsequently was the makings of a real-life romance), but pay attention to the cinematography, the editing, the soundtrack...  All magnificently well done.  Some of the scenes are absolutely visually stunning, such as the sunsets, and when Noah takes Alli on the lake and all of the white ducks are swimming around them.    The only scene that I find hard to take - and which might have been overdone a bit - is towards the end when Noah and Alli are dancing in one of her lucid periods and she lapses back into dementia and doesn't recognize him again.  It is painful to watch and I thought that they could have made the characters be not so intensely emotional and still been effective.    Other than that one minor criticism, it is a film that is truly a love story for the ages, and one that I will continue to watch again and again as the years go by; and if I am lucky, with someone I love.
B0019CSXAM|5.0|Season 3 is probably the best season of the show. Although the show is essentially about Ted, we really get to focus more on the other characters this season which has been a great plus for me - I especially like seeing where Marshall is headed.    When I first bought season 1 (while season 2 was almost finished airing) I was hooked on the show, although something was lacking. Maybe it was a little too gimmicky, or maybe it was just that I was so unused to this kind of show. The \\"finding true love\\" aspect isn't exactly new; I mean that the style of humor - the \\"bro\\" humor, if you will - that I never really paid attention to.  Fortunately, HIMYM was making me laugh, quite possibly more than any other show that I've followed.     I then waited for season 2 to come out (then to go on sale), which is when I was really blown away. Some definite highlights are Robin Sparkles, slap bet, and learning more about Barney's past. More laughs, more fun.    Now, pertaining to this season, the characters have matured, the writing has really tightened up, and by this point the actors have really sunk into their roles - especially (in my heavily biased opinion) Jason Segal. He's one of the best comedic actors on television, precisely because he isn't afraid to do some truly wild things.    The guest stars this season are great too, notably: Sarah Chalke, John Cho, Heidi Klum, Mandy Moore, Britney Spears (eh), and especially James Van Der Beek.    As a capstone on the great episodes, this box set has the best special features of all 3 seasons. There is a hilarious uncensored (ACTUALLY uncensored!!) gag reel which is extremely fun  to watch. It's one of the best gag reels I've seen on any DVD, and it's fairly long too, clocking in at roughly 8 minutes. Besides that, there's about 10 minutes or so of Marshall and Lily's honeymoon video, a making of an episode feature, many, many commentaries, and a couple music videos (Robin Sparkles, and Marshall's slapsgiving song).
6304806442|5.0|This is a horribly amusing movie full of witty little lessons. I think it works wonders on curious teenagers. I saw this movie at a critical time in my life and after seeing it there is no way in hell I would ever willingly get hooked on anything except life. Some people are disgusted by this movie because of what drugs are shown to do but truly this is just a drop in the ocean. This will be in my top ten for the forseeable future.
B001DHXT1G|3.0|Being a Marvel Comics fan back-in-the-day, this movie (much moreso than the previous theatrical version) is much more faithful to the original comic book character and exploits.     Most have already seen this movie, or have heard enough about it to have formed an opinion. This review focuses mainly on the Blu-ray release.    Since I've been into Home Video before it was even called as such (when Laserdisc and CED were the disc-based movie formats), I'm a little more critical than most. I'd already had HD DVD for quite a while as well, before being forced (by Toshiba) to take the Blu-ray plunge.     That said, the picture quality of this disc is okay; not the best Blu-ray can offer (that I've seen...on HD DVD even), but still okay. The image is a little darker than normal. This might not be as apparent on a small (say 50\\" or smaller) HD display; especially if the display isn't properly calibrated...in other words, like right-out-of-the-box...with the Contrast and Brightness still jacked up by the manufacturer; but at 8 ft, it's noticeable in comparison to other titles (Matrix Trilogy-BR, SpeedRacer-BR, King Kong-HD DVD, Transformers-HD DVD, etc.,). There's plenty of detail; but that comes along with all HD...if properly mastered.    The reason I didn't give it 4 stars is because even though it contains a lossless main soundtrack (DTS HD MA), it doesn't contain a Dolby Digital 5.1 sountrack (like the majority of all DVDs); it only contains a Dolby Digital 4-channel version of Pro Logic. So believe it or not, unless you have DTS gear (most people don't; most don't even have Dolby Digital gear), you can actually get better sound (full-range in all channels) from the DVD version of this movie than the HD version...if you at least have Dolby Digital equip.     I know it's a decision by the film-makers, but it's a bad decision (and will only confuse the public even more) to not include Dolby Digital 5.1 English tracks on all Blu-ray movies...along with whatever lossless tracks they want; to keep them backwards compatible with the majority of people that now have DVD. BTW, the animated menu/sounds/music for this movie IS in Dolby Digital 5.1, strangely enough.     I have a dedicated Home theater, and I'm an early adopter..when it makes sense; but I'll be even more careful in selecting Blu-ray titles now, after discovering this. Can't even always go by the packaging either (this happened even back when DVD was introduced).     The same goes for RAMBO BTW...no English DD5.1 tracks...even though some of the packaging says so; it does have FRENCH Dolby Digital 5.1 tracks though! Go figure.
1416909532|2.0|Ladies, listen up: There's a better book for single gals--by far--than this one. Check out Ditching Mr. Wrong, by Nicholas Aretakis. I recently had to read a stack of dating books for a writing project, so I've had a chance to compare every relevant title out there. In Ditching Mr. Wrong, Aretakis betrays the \\"secret handshake\\" between guys and lets gals know what tricks and traps to avoid when single men are on the prowl. If I had a 20-something daughter, I'd buy Ditching for her instead. The viewpoint in He's Just Not That Into You is, in my eyes, a tad misogynist. Ditching, on the other hand, shows women how to quickly vet a Mr. Wrong so she doesn't waste her time. It's also chockfull of fun tips, quizzes, and checklists. It's a high self-esteem book and exceptionally practical--much more so, in my opinion, than He's Just Not That Into You.

B001DDBCUA|1.0|Having thoroughly enjoyed the series, I was very much looking forward to the movie. It was a terrible disappointment. The characters, who through the series had developed into complex characters, seem to have forgotten everything they learned, and were once again flat characartures. The first hour moved very slowly. There was also a LOT of very explicit sex, to the point that I was embarassed. This was not supposed to be pornography, but it may as well have been.    In short, stick with your fond memories of the series, and imagine your own ending; seeing this will only disappoint.
B000N6TX1I|5.0|I really can't think of a better science fiction movie in the last decade. It isn't about the standard story of how we bring about our own demise, or the immediate aftermath. In fact, we don't even know why people stop having children. Instead, we look at the world twenty or so years from now, and see how people have learned to deal with it.<br /><br />What really makes this a superb movie is the way in which the story is told. Long, single shots make this a beautiful movie in its own right. Most things are shown, not told, and whenever I watch it I see something new (watch for the worn out London Olympics 2012 sweatshirt!). Technology has progressed in a believable way, and is there not to show off the latest in special effects but to draw you in to the realism. Each little thing sums up to an amazing movie.<br /><br />Every time I watch this movie, I imagine how it might have been as done by another director. And every time, I'm very, very thankful.
B000IJ79WU|5.0|Yes, it does have the appearence of being cobbled together at times -- using a screen test to fill in a scene -- but all in all it works and better than the final product from Richard Lester -- which is, really, 80% of what Richard Donner shot in the first damn place.  Because some things need to be filled out, some of the Lester footage is used but even so, you get a look at the vision Richard Donner intended.  Alternate shots on Krypton for the three super villains, footage with Marlon Brando that was removed when the Salkinds were sued by him for monies due.  One of the a-bombs from the first film thrown by Supes into space release them from the Phantom Zone (in very interesting fashion) as oppposed to the Eiffel Tower sequence in the Lester version.  All in all, though a real rough cut, a satisfying way to view what really are two films that should have dove-tailed together all those years ago. As with the first film, Chris Reeve (the best actor who ever played the part) makes it work.  Some slightly different prison footage with Gene Hackman and Ned Beatty and the destruction of the Fortress of Solitude. All in all, highly recommended.  Whenever I watch SUPERMAN II anymore it is this version, not the one that landed on the movie screens back in 1981.
B0014DZ2VO|5.0|This film is as different from CASINO ROYALE as FROM RUSSIA WITH LOVE is from GOLDFINGER.  Does that make it inferior?  No, just a tad different. You still have the hard, dark Bond as protrayed by Daniel Craig.  Whereas CR took some time to let character develop QOS takes off from frame one like an ICBM and never lets up.  Like LTK, Bond is left out on his own, cut off from MI6 who think he is on a destructive vendetta. Part of the climax is a battle between Bond and Greene (Mathieu Almaric).  Bond's much smaller opponent fights with the ferocity of a lunatic.  Nice performances by Craig, Olga Kurleyenko, Almaric and -- in an all too brief role -- Gemma Atherton.  Don't be alarmed by the absence of the gun barrel opening -- they tacked it on the end credits.  Like many of the best Bonds, it is slightly under two hours.  It makes it tighter and the action pacing headlong. Craig, once again, proves that while alot of other actors could play this role, it's hard to picture anyone else doing it.  It's really him and Sean Connery.
B00000DOYL|4.0|As I started to augment my Zeppelin vinyl collection, this was my first CD that I ordered out of many. It was time to ensure that I had each and every Zeppelin related CD in my library.
B00005JPCF|4.0|The good:<br /><br />I really liked the overall story of the plight of the penguin. The outcast going on the odyssey and then returning home with a hero's welcome.<br /><br />Children **really** love this movie.<br /><br />The music was well done and many very nice, but not too overplayed hits were threaded delicately into the soundtrack. I would've loved to have heard more than just a few bars of K.D. Lang's version of 'Golden Slumbers', but I guess that's what the soundtrack is for.<br /><br />I thought Robin Williams did good work as Ramon here. I will revisit his contribution in the next section as well.<br /><br />This movie had a very subtle message of conservation that wasn't preachy or contrived.<br /><br />It was funny to listen to the King of Steampunk voice the King of Rock n' Roll. I think his penguin Elvis definitely breaks new ground with with old ideas about the King's voice.<br /><br />Steve Irwin would've loved this movie.<br /><br />The bad:<br /><br />I felt the scene that's added in the extras titled: 'Mumble meets a Blue Whale' should've been added into the film for all the reasons that the introduction to the clip stated. I found it odd that Robin Williams could have multiple parts in a film but it was a bit much to have the seagull version of Steve Irwin doing a parody of himself which was very touching. The scene with the elephant seals was dull and difficult to pick out the dialogue. Steve Irwin should've been given his moment in this as this may have bee the last major motion picture that he was attached to.<br /><br />Robin Williams having two very large parts within the film was not just disconcerting but off-putting. While I did like the character of Ramon, I couldn't get around the thought that Williams was probably taking bread off the table of another actor. Cedric the Entertainer comes to mind as well as Bernie Mac. I think Bernie would've been fantastic in the role of Lovelace and it even seems written for him.<br /><br />Also, while we're meant to rightly assume that the narrator is Lovelace, the narration is almost a role in itself as you're left guessing which character it is because he has multiple speaking parts. So chalking up three jobs seems very much over the top.<br /><br />Overall:<br /><br />I really enjoyed the film and think most others will as well. The points I make are minor ones that the bulk of children wouldn't even give two shakes about. My thoughts about Robin Williams role in this has been repeated quite a bit in many of the other reviews. It looks very good in HD / Blu-Ray as well.<br /><br />... ...most a role in itself as you're left guessing which character it is because he has multiple speaking parts.

B001GQ2TGA|4.0|As with every product, there's good and bad aspects.  The very good is this is 12 brand new winter songs--not retreads of the same old traditionals, which seem to be the fodder of most of the Christmas offerings. And a neat dozen songs timing out at 44.9 minutes, which is more than a lot of new albums offer nowadays.     The music is the ethereal atmospheric tone you have come to expect from Enya.  If you like this type of music, you are going to love the CD.     Favorites:    One Toy Soldier   Journey of the Angels     I would like to see Enya grow and add some different instruments and musical styles to her repertoire, but honestly, for what it is, the CD is very good.

B00132GBRA|5.0|I have backpacked all my life. I live in the desert southwest and wear these boots everyday. They are so light and give such great support. I am 66 and have gone through a lot of boots in my time. These are the best ever!
B000W4HJ44|5.0|Hairspray is one of my all-time favorite movies. Its a great storie about how a girl trys to fallow her dream. Its also holds a great message about breaking boundrys and defying the negitive forces in the world. Such as egotistic racists. I say this because this movie is set in 1962 Baltamore.
0756404746|5.0|Thank God for amazon's recomendations because they got me to try this new author and his first book was riveting...  He brings to life a great world filled with mystery as well as believable characters...  This book is a keeper.  He has moved up onto my list of great authors such as Tolkien, David Gemmell, and L.E. Modeseitt Jr.
B0011HOEY4|4.0|The best thing this movie had going for it - which is no surprise - is the acting duo of Denzel Washington and Russell Crowe. How many bad movies do you see with either of those guys starring in them? Not many, and neither actor disappoints here. Both play fascinating guys, Washington, a big gangster (\\"Frank Lucas\\") and Crowe, an honest cop (\\"Richie Roberts\\")    This movie reminded me a lot of the '83 \\"Scarface\\" film in which Tony Montana (Al Pacino) rises from the bottom up to be a big drug lord, only to have things crumble big-time. We see a similar tale here with \\"Lucas,\\" except that his fall is sudden in this stor.    Director Ridley Scott and photographer Harris Savides also give us a slick- looking film, very pretty spots and stylishly-directed. The story wasn't quite as good as the \\"hype,\\" but I was never bored despite the two- and-a-half-hour length of it. I was a bit confused in the first 25 minutes but things straightened out after that.    It was entertaining enough for me that I'd watch it again.
B00005JL7Q|5.0|I simply can't express what a total treat this film is. Hugh Grant puts on his finest performance (next to Edward Farrars in Sense and Sensibility) and the writing and direction are absolutely perfect. This film has it all, humor, message, quirkiness, drama... You can't go wrong with a viewing of this excellent work of art.
0783233477|5.0|I'm a huge movie buff and find myself partial to dramatic, personal performances.  MJB wasn't the blockbuster event when released and I believe, as many of you, this film has been tragically overlooked.  Luckily, it seems to have resurfaced and grown some new legs.      The dialogue is mysterious, cryptic and haunting to say the least.  Your heart will tear and heal several times.  The storyline paces you through the dynamic, father/daughter relationship, our own inevitable mortality, and several, classic displays of integrity.    Anyone who has a strong sense of self and a sincere hope that good things come to deserved people will enjoy where this journey takes you.  So many life lessons are front and center through out.      Do yourself a favor if you've not taken this one in yet- rent it, buy it.  Invest a couple hours with Tony and Co.  Soak up the conversations, the scenery and watch the magic unfold.  Unlike so much of the superficial, over commercialized excuses for movies we subject ourselves to - this one is a treat.  If you do it right - the message will resonate for a long, long time.
031606792X|5.0|This book was simply one word. A-M-A-Z-I-N-G!   I love this series soooo much.    I am a team jacob fan and am very happy with the outcome of breaking dawn. I was excited about Jake imprinting on Nessie and how he could also still be best frwends with bella also.   I lovved how Edward and Bella got married and had a beatiful honey moon. I aslso LOVE LOVE LOVED LOVED Nessie with a deep passion.   My three favorite things about this book were A) Nessie b) Bella becomes a vampire and c)The Volturi Action   Overall I enjoyed this series and reccomend it to everyone who reads this review! (and all the other people out there that havent! boy ure in for a treat!!!!!!!!!)
1582701709|5.0|Great reading material filled with wisdom and inspiration.  I couldn't have read a more appropriate book for this time in my life.  I would encourage anyone who is in the process of redefining their life's journey to read The Secret.  Through my personal efforts and the written words from The Secret I am living my authentic self.
1400044162|5.0|Once you start reading HALF OF A YELLOW SUN, you'll find it hard to put it aside. What starts out like an innocent love story quickly turns into a serious thriller set in the Nigerian civil war over Biafra, Africa's first and major genocide of the 20th century in a country that supplies 15 % of America's oil, a war that cost millions of civilian lives. The author, Chimamanda Adichie seems too young to have lived through this harrowing experience herself, but her powerful novel truly invokes the realities of history and quickly immerses even those who had no clue. A must read for every person interested in the human condition, in genocide, politics and Africa.
1401216676|2.0|I payed for it of course, but I still find it be a bit overpriced.   It's one of the greatest Joker tales ever told, and an important one for any collector to have. Yet, for the sheer depth of the story arch and the amount that I was charged... It was just a bit pricey.
B001GQ2TGA|5.0|In a way, after awhile I kind of start to miss a new release from Enya and what she does. Granted there's not a lot that she does differently and one can make a case that she doesn't alter a thing about her music however that's what she knows and it's what she knows best. Having previously done Christmas releases before, this is not only her first full-length album centered around the holiday and winter but her first of new material since 2005's \\"Amarantine\\". And like a lot of her records, \\"And Winter Came\\" exceeds as a whole but can divide in its parts.    And Winter Came: Having broken the cycle of self-titled instrumentals with last record, this one brings back the tradition of letting the music play and here we have a re-worked version of \\"Midnight Blue\\", a track found on the \\"Wild Child\\" single. Using slow piano arpeggios, her familiar background vocals, it's certainly a wonderful way to open the record though doesn't have the gorgeousness of \\"Memory of Trees\\". 8.5/10    Journey of the Angels: A slower song with Enya's vocals having lost no impact after near 20 years since \\"Watermark\\" and it's a nice one with some doubled vocals and some nice harmonies though it might be a bit slow for some people but it works well. 8/10    White is in the Winter Light: Enya's songs are either near-solemn, tranquil and gorgeous or bouncy and this one's the latter. While not as infectious as \\"The River Sings\\" or \\"Orinoco Flow\\", it's certainly a perfect holiday song to get you in a festive and lively mood and naturally, it's the second single. 8.5/10    O Come O Come Emmanuel: Her lovely vocals are back where it takes on an almost haunting/tragic quality where it's almost funereal. This gets broken up occasionally with multi-tracked vocals taking on a cathedral sound, like a holy place (perfect for Christmas naturally). Not really \\"catchy\\" but lovely. 7.5/10    Trains and Winter Rains: The first single and it's one of those tracks where it can possibly grow on you and while it'sa good Enya track, it's not really a good single choice either. The mix on her vocals makes words occasionally hard to discern but it's a minor gripe. 7.5/10    Dreams are More Precious: More reflective and calmer in tone, it's one of those tracks where the more I listen, the more I \\"get it\\" since it's not really an immediate track due to its pace. I like the vocal help some words get during the chorus and the bridge works quite well. Give this one time. 8/10    Last Time by Moonlight: While it starts out like it might be another softer track, it picks up and ends up having one of the lovelier chorus on the album. Her vocals are top-notch and the arrangement is sparse and non-cluttered yet perfect. Definately an album highlight. 9.5/10    One Toy Soldier: Kind of a quirky song thanks to a melody and music and it's kind of endearing where it just sounds so charming and it brings you in. However, the song doesn't really take off and though it does add some percussion for bigger effect and a bridge adding more parts, it's not a very dynamic track. 7/10    Stars and Midnight Blue: It's worth listening to mainly for her vocals (of course) and it's one of the better slow songs on the album but the chorus makes it stand out and her singing but the disappointment comes in that it only shows up once. An affecting chorus only used once, bah. It's like \\"Pax Deorum\\"'s utterly gorgeous bridge surrounded by her ominous Latin chanting only this ain't as foreboding a song. It works in a way. 7.5/10    Spirit of Christmas Past: On the \\"Memory of Trees\\" album there's a track called \\"China Roses\\" which is not only my favorite song she's done but also one of my favorite songs, periods. The tranquility, the beauty and the overwhelming calm that track makes me feel is one of those \\"never-gets-old\\" tracks for me. This one is along those lines. While it doesn't have as lovely a coda, her vocals on this one are absolutely perfect, especially the higher ones in the chorus. Best track on thealbum for me. 10/10    My Time Flies: This is one of those love-it-or-hate-it ones mainly due to its uniqueness. A full-on pop song if I ever heard her do one, it's nice she's going a bit out of her comfort zone (complete with a blues-y guitar solo of all things, when was the last time you remember guitar in an Enya track?). A bouncier track and seems like a 60's pop song done Enya-style, it's notable for its atypical sound but on a record like this, it stands out a bit too much. 8/10    Oiche Chiuin (chorale): This is basically her arrangement of Silent Night but with more vocals layered in. Her original had some of the best vocals she's ever laid down and essentially an alternate arrangement still keeps its lovelyness though not the original's intimacy and almost complete bare emotion. It's certainly a great closer but when you listen to the other, having that one would've been perfect. 8/10    Like a lot of her albums, this is the kind of track where it's best to leave it on and just let it do what it does which it happens to do incredibly well. But when you look at each track separately, parts might not completely work and some could've had more time and work but for fans this is more of what she excels at and makes for a welcome soundtrack for the holidays.
B00127RAJY|4.0|I have to say that the workouts seriously kick my butt. I'm in pretty good shape and at a beginner/moderate level of fitness.     About the workout: There are no breaks. The workouts are only 20 minutes long and you work for the full 20. Jillian is a pretty good motivator. The workout is done in circuits of strength, cardio, and abs. The exercises are basic moves such as lunges, squats, flys, and rows. Some people may get bored with such basic moves, but for the choreography challenged (me), it was a sigh of relief. I like a good dance workout as much as anyone, but most of the time I end up stumbling all over myself. This was a basic boot-camp style workout, the kind I used to do while training in gymnastics (many years ago), and the simplicity of the moves was welcome. I definitely have trouble going up the stairs afterwards. You just don't stop moving!     The downside, and the reason for my 4-star rating is that the workout is  hard on your knees. I had a severe tibial plateau fracture about a year ago and have finally gotten the ok from my doctor to exercise more vigorously. There is a lot of jumping in this workout, so beware, my knee was definitely sore afterwards the first time around. I've adjusted myself to not jump so high, but faster to minimize the impact and I can do the workout without any pain and still be sweat soaked at the end. This will most definitely be part of my regular rotation as it makes a great morning workout before work or even a lunchtime workout at work!

0800130227|4.0|\\"Matilda\\" is about a small girl in a home more interested in making a sleazy buck than thinking about its children.  Worse yet, she is sent to a private school led by an abusive former female Olympic shot-put, hammer-throw, and javelin winner.<br /><br />The good news is that Matilda develops special mind powers that enable her to free her teacher from the abusive principal and recover her home, as well as free herself from her non-caring parents - to be adopted by her wonder teacher.
0375826726|5.0|This was a great book and i can not wait for book 4 to come out.
032147404X|4.0|I saw this book at Barnes and Noble looking for a good book to help me get sharper pictures (which has been my vice.)  Coming across this book, I flipped a couple of pages and was sold - I put down the big heavy technical book I was holding and went straight to the register.  And I was not sorry that I bought this book, either.    Sure, there is the thing about his humor.  I could care less most of the time, except that the beginning is weighed down by him trying to explain to you in detail how the book works, and spending an exorbitant amount of time taking pride over the titles of the first few pages.  I learned my lesson - I skipped the intros and went to what I needed.    Already, the first day reading, I was excited and ready to run out and take professional looking photos, I was so encouraged.  (It was night time, however, and the irony is he doesn't cover night time photography in his book.  Not this one, at least.  I can't say for the second book.)  I've experimented on my cat and the flowers in my garden and already I can see a difference in my photography.  Not only that, but even though this isn't a technical book, I have a much better understanding of my camera!    What I love best about this book (and what truly sold me on it) was the last chapter about \\"photo recipes\\".  He tells you exactly the environment he was in in order to get the shot, the camera setting, what number to set aperture size or shutter speed (things I had not gotten the hang of yet, so it HELPS), and what equipment he used.  The book may be short (just over 200 pages), but it's straight to the point, so you don't need to swim through the technical aspect of things.  His examples are beautiful works of art and he even gives us a peek into his bag to see what he brings on shoots.  I've also kept in mind some equipment recommendations.    All in all, yeah his sense of humor is a little much, but it's a wonderful glimpse for the amateur photographer as to how to pros work.
0446579939|3.0|I could not wait to read \\"The Lucky One\\". I bought it as soon as it was released.  The premise of the book was an interesting idea, but the book fell flat except for the last 8 pages.  I kept thinking I was missing something, but my sister read it with the same exact sentiment.  My favorites are still \\"A Walk to Remember\\" \\"The Rescue\\" and \\"The Notebook\\".  Not one book he has written since has come close.  This book was plain boring and seemed rushed and amateurish in the writing.  Nicholas Sparks has talent just not in this not so Lucky One!
B001DHXT1G|3.0|I like Ed Norton and thought this movie would be better than the 2003 version.  How could it not be?  Yes, it was better because they didn't waste time in character development.  Yeah, we all know Bruce used himself to test an experimental procedure and turns into the Hulk when he gets angry -- or in this case his heart beat rises.  All things considered, this movie is a solid 3 stars; but, not a bit more.  The plot is predictable and not very imaginative.  The CGI was good but not great.  Rent this movie (like I did) since you probably won't want to watch it again.
0061478784|4.0|The story of Sophie Hatter, her curse, and the multitude of relationships that form as a result of her quest to end it form an engaging story. I approached this book from having seen the movie first and was very surprised at how loosely the movie's story was based on the original work.     Diana Wynne Jones has written a children's book set in a land where magic is commonplace and is part of the everyday. While the Castle that moves about of its own accord causes some worry among the populace, its not considered scary or unusual. What this book does very well is build on the relationships it establishes fairly early on. The story itself seems to bounce around quite a bit and I wasn't very impressed with an ending seemed confusing and haphazard...which reduced the impact of the book's climatic scene. That being said, the characters are very memorable and the setting is very well developed.
B000YABYLA|5.0|\\"Juno\\" grabs you from the start,walking down the street drinking a gallon of Sunny D.Ellen  Page is so cool,thats the only word I can think of.I've know people in my life somewhat like her who just say whats on there mind.I wish I could have been like that.  Michael Cera has become such a huge star,I never thought after seeing him on \\"Arrested Development\\"I would hear from him again,even though I was a fan of the show,and its great to have Jason Bateman also in the movie who does a great job .{I also think the music from the film is so cool and different}  The ending is a big suprise.I thought I figured it out,but I didn't.  \\"Juno\\" is a film  everyone will enjoy.
B000002KCB|5.0|I just cried. So beautiful getting a 2008 new reissue vinyl/lp/record of T'STN.<br />I haven't listened to a fresh piece of vinyl out of the plastic wrapper holding the 12' album cover the 12' new record in soooo long. And putting it on the techinics turntable with the Grado blue p mount just made me emotional. Since 1988 when they stopped making records I thought the cd would be a perfect replacement. But a brand new spanking lp especially this one is just a soothing warm analog non digital experience.<br />I did however burn the lp on cd in the first play. Its unfortunate so many of my old records are scratched pops skips as well as bad vinyl...like those elektra and rca even those old reprise records werent so hot.<br />now with the most perfected technology in the history of man kind ...they should by know by now to learn how to make records the right way....instead of the wrong way....picking out bad vinyl materials and using crappy transfer equiptment....
B001GAOY5U|3.0|Goof family movie, really bad 3d. the opening credits are great then after that washed out and wow did it give you a headache.
0446579939|3.0|I loved Nicholas Sparks. I have twelve of the fourteen books he has written. That being said, he does something that irks me and this book was the last straw.  Characters who are not the leading lady tend to have their looks sacrificed. Do I need Sparks to write about how the clerk at the police station is three hundred pounds because she eats donuts? Not really. Do I need to hear how a chauvinist male character in this book refers that a woman he just had sex with needed to leave because she had \\"bad teeth and pockmarked skin\\"? And how the leading lady is \\"The most beautiful woman he's ever seen?\\" Again, no. This gets me to thinking... am I unworthy because I have glasses and eczema. (Among many other flaws. I am far from physically perfect.) I depend on Jennifer Weiner for my entertainment, her books are full of depth, but Sparks is supposed to be the writer of my adult fairy tales, and I am going to finish this book, because it's good, but my love for books by Sparks is quickly diminishing and I probably won't pay for any more.
0786939532|2.0|Obviously written to provide background for previously written books, this book is stilted and predictable.    While the story had some potential, the writing and characterizations were wooden and unfortunately Mr. Salvatore cannot write a fight scene to save his life.
B000MRA5NS|4.0|I love the movie and the transaction was fast and delivery excellent, the only issue, and im aware its got nothing to do with the seller, its that the description does not show that the movie subtitles are in Thai...    I guess that needs to be added to the description...
0696204800|4.0|Book OK and in as-described condition. Please with seller's shipping time. I rate this seller as a good one.
B001AX9DT0|4.0|First time I've bought anything by this artist.  Since buying it I have kept it in heavy rotation in my car CD player.  His voice is very different, and his phrasing is wonderful.  In some ways he reminds me of a young Van Morrison.  I hope to hear more from him.
B001DHXT1G|4.0|Well. I have to say this release matched my expectations. The movie itself is pretty cool. I should by honest about it: this is one of the best quality images I´ve ever seen in a Blu-Ray release. It´s a shame the content is not as good as Iron Man´s but it still good.     The Incredible Hulk delivers the goods and I´m sure we´ll see a Director´s Cut in a near future!     Enjoy it!
B001F290E4|5.0|I LOVE his voice.  It blows me away every time.  The originals of these songs were all amazing, but Seal's voice just takes them to a whole new level.  After I saw him and David Foster on Dr. Phil the other day in the studio, I just had to get a copy!  Best album of the year for me by far!
B000AJJNPY|2.0|I've been recommended this band by more sources than I can count, based on my deep affection toward Radiohead, Bjork, and others of the experimental variety. I had already heard the somewhat overdone but unquestionably dramatic \\"Saeglopur,\\" and despite some decidedly odd vocals, I liked it. My hope was that these on-the-edge-of-hearing vocals might mellow out in some slightly more earthly tracks. No such luck.    Doubtless all those who have given this rave 5-star reviews will think this reviewer biased and close-minded. Thankfully, this is not the case. As a DJ and as an avid explorer of the experimental, I love dipping my I-pod into the sea of the unknown, finding bands none of my friends have even heard of and slowly expanding my diverse collection. Sigur Ros will not make that collection, unless (and please tell me if this is the case) their other albums are far more grounded than this free-floating entity. Perhaps I'll wait for the band members' balls to drop, or perhaps they will all merge into one single Icelandic talent, otherwise known as Bjork (who, despite some very off-the-wall vocals, can, in fact, sing). Until then, my more masculine side craves something with some soul and some bravado. Check please.
158270208X|3.0|I would recommend \\"The Secret\\" over \\"The Secret Gratitude Book.\\"  In \\"The Secret\\" Rhonda Byrne identified a way to rekindle the human spirit during these stressful times.<br /><br />I was expecting further explanation/exploration the Gratitude philosophy in the gratitude book and was disappointed. I see the benefit of the book as a journal though I would not have purchased it as a gift if I had known it was a journal/workbook.

B001H5X7I4|5.0|So I got this from the studio before it was released - it's amazing that a movie so funny already could actually get BETTER!!<br /><br />Not much else to discuss - all of the special features are worth watching, the extended scenes don't get too long, and it's worth EVERY PENNY!<br /><br />Nothing else to wait for as far as special editions are concerned - this is the disc to buy. Do it.
B000LC4CVA|5.0|Love this music. It is amazing the sound of these women's voices make. It is beautiful. I have shared this DVD with others and they all love it.
B000MG1ZG0|1.0|During the 1970s and 80s, much was made of the practice of issuing Jimi Hendrix's unfinished recordings with newly added backing tracks.  While this abhorrent practice eventually ended, it seems as if the surviving Doors have willingly chosen to go down this road.  Ray Manzarek writes about wanting the fans to hear what was on the \\"actual multitrack recordings\\" as well as bringing forth the \\"original conceptions\\".  This is all nice and dandy, but what they've done is add in instrumental and vocal asides that do nothing more than subtract from the songs' original impact.  \\"Roadhouse Blues\\" is a great example of this:  What was once an extremely tight rocker now becomes bloated with \\"background vocals by Jim Morrison, piano parts of mine (Manzarek) that weren't used, and guitar stingers and solos by Robby Krieger that NEVER MADE THE ORIGINAL RECORDINGS (emphasis mine).\\"  To put it bluntly, this is NOT the album Morrison Hotel as it was issued by the Doors.  It is instead a different album constructed from the earlier work by the surviving Doors and their engineer which, truthfully, has little of the economical greatness of the original album.  I'm so, so sorry that I spent twelve bucks on this reissue; I only wish that I could get a refund in an honest manner.  I have not heard the other reissues, so I cannot form any critical opinion concerning them.  However, forewared is forearmed in respect to this version of Morrison Hotel.  Manzarek and the others involved in perpetrating this charade upon the public should live in shame, although I'm sure this won't keep them from cashing their royalty checks.
1595141979|5.0|I really liked this book, i was reading a different vampire trilogy and got completely bored...found this one and really liked it! Obviously not as good as Stephenie Meyer's Twilight, but that book just can't be compared too! She has a great style of writing that attracts the reader to keep reading! enjoyed.
B000002LND|5.0|I've owned this 1990 CD release since 1993.  It was the first CD I ever bought. This CD covers Madonna's best songs from her 1983-1989 albums. Everything from \\"Holiday\\" to \\"Vogue\\". All of these songs are rerecorded versions of the originals, so they sound a little different than the originals.  Thankfully they didn't stray too far from the originals though. They are not crappy remixes or anything of that nature, just slightly updated for the time (1990). This is still one of my favorite CD's of my ever growing collection. I love about 15 of the 18 total songs, and that's unheard of!
B001E7OO2I|5.0|I'm not understanding the reasoning behind the STRONG dislikes against this album at all... maybe because this album is soooo different from his previous ones. Well, in my opinion, the album summed up in one word: EPIC. I loved his 1st, was kinda feelin the 2nd, and ended up being a bit scared about the turnout of this album... WELL, it turned out just fine ! This is really what his second album should've been. It DEFINITELY has a different vibe so BEWARE and it doesn't include many of the monumental emphasized \\"ballad-singing\\" Legend usually does but IF you can get over that, the album is pretty damn good. The topics brought up on EVOLVER still have the strong roots of Legend's creativity. The Feel Good tracks include his joints with Kanye West, Estelle, & Brandy and also his solo joints \\"Everybody Knows,\\" \\"Good Morning,\\" & \\"I Love, You Love.\\" The only track that sounds bad is Track 8: \\"This Time\\" and one of the extra bonus tracks \\"Pride (In The Name Of Love).\\" Other than that, this album is FIYA--- respect J.L. for what he still knows how to do & that's making goood music !    PEACE.
B001EOQWFI|5.0|I cannot rave enough about this movie. The trailers (in my opinion) did a poor job of giving an idea of what this movie is about. It is a love story as well as being a statement on our lazy society, with a not-so-subtle but very intelligently delivered message: we are running out of time. Be responsible! It may sound heavy, but trust me...this is a total gem to watch. Only Disney/Pixar could make a little animated robot like Wall-E so loveable. Wall-E is a robot who has been left on earth to try to clean up the polluted mess that the humans left there before escaping aboard what basically resembles a space-cruise ship. Another robot, Eve, comes to earth and finds a plant on Earth, signalling that the planet might be able to sustain life again. When the \\"higher-ups\\" try to squelch that information, it's up to Wall-E & Eve to get the word out, otherwise the humans are doomed to be overweight blobs for the rest of their lives. Honestly, I do sympathize with Pixar for their poor trailers; Wall-E is difficult to put into words. Just watch it! The characterizations is truly amazing. Voice talent includes Sigourney Weaver, Fred Willard, John Ratzenberger, and Kathy Najimy.<br /><br />\\"Wall-E\\" is a direct-to-digital transfer presented in 1080p/AVC MPEG-4 video at 2.35:1 on the Blu-ray edition. On the 3-disc special editions, there are two discs packed full of extras and a third with a Digital Copy. All video materials are presented in full 1080 video (on the Blu-ray version), and subtitle options are offered in English on the video-based materials.<br /><br />Disc One:<br /><br />Audio Commentary - The standard DVD edition of 'Wall-E' includes an audio commentary with director Andrew Stanton. That commentary is presented here in a Cine-Explore mode that also includes picture-in-picture visual information with an option to switch off the visuals and listen to the audio-only portion. The commentary with Stanton is the same for the DVD and Blu-ray versions.<br /><br />Short Pixar Film: \\"Burn-E\\" (HD, 7 minutes) - About a little robot (Burn-E) who tries to replace a light on the outside of a spaceship. Intercut with scenes from Wall-E, Burn-E is just as adorable as Eve & Wall-E. The short is also viewable in a PIP mode that includes running storyboards for the entire short. Great for behind-the-scenes geeks.<br /><br />Short Film (HD, 5 minutes) - This Pixar short called \\"Presto\\" was shown with Wall-E when it was released. I really enjoyed this tale of a magician whose rabbit revolts when he won't feed him a carrot. The animation is spectacular, and so is the story. I hope to see more of this comic due. The rabbit definitely has shades of Bugs Bunny, but with a little more heart.<br /><br />Theatrical Trailers (HD) - Including 'Pinocchio,' 'The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian,' 'Earth' and 'Tinker Bell and the Lost Treasure,' as well as a 'Disney Parks' promo spot.<br /><br />Disc Two:<br /><br />The extras on disc two are divided into two sections, first \\"Robots,\\" then \\"Humans.\\" All materials are in full 1080 HD, with English, French and Spanish Dolby Digital 2.0 Stereo and subtitle options.<br /><br />Deleted Scenes (HD, 22:54 minutes) - Featured in the \\"Humans\\" section, you get four scenes here, playable individually or as a group (with introduction by Andrew Stanton). The four scenes are: \\"Garbage Airlock,\\" \\"Dumper,\\" \\"Secret Files,\\" and \\"Docking.\\" They vary in their degree of being \\"finished\\" (some made it to the completely animated stage, some just have rough concept art). The scenes are enjoyable, but after hearing Stanton's explanations, it is obvious that the right choices were made. Interesting to hear Stanton say that very few extraneous scenes actually make it to the fully animated stage.<br /><br />\\"Behind-the-Scenes\\" Featurettes (HD, 1:09:45 minutes) - These documentaries give us a fairly thorough visual overview of the conception and production of 'Wall-E.' Interviews with Stanton and most of the Pixar crew are intercutwith extensive making-of footage shot during the story development, animation, and post-production processes. \\"The Imperfect Lens: Creating the Look of Wall-E\\" (14:32) covers the beginning stages of visual design. \\"Animation Sound Design: Building Worlds from the Sound Up\\" (18:43) dissects the creation of the film's entire soundtrack, which was constructed completely in the studio. \\"Captain's Log: The Evolution of Humans\\" (7:57) goes in-depth into the conceptualization and rendering of the film's human characters. \\"Notes on a Score\\" (10:39) discusses Wall-E's music. \\"Wall-E and Eve\\" (7:00) is an excellent look at how the Pixar team gave depth and humanity to Wall-E and Eve. They apparently imagined the two as if they were Buster Keanton and Sigourney Weaver!<br /><br />BnL Shorts (HD, 8:45 minutes) - Full-length versions of the three short films watched by Wall-E in the movie are presented here uncut and fully-animated. The three shorts are: \\"Captaining the Axiom,\\" \\"Operation Cleanup\\" and \\"Meet the BnL Bots.\\". With some narration by Fred Willard, it is obvious that these are made in a sarcastic tone, but still, they are somewhat depressing seeing how slothful and lazy the humans have become at this stage. Funny, yet very cautionary. \\"BnL\\" stands for \\"Buy n' Large\\" (with the aprostrophe after \\"n\\" eventually being dropped).<br /><br />Gallery (HD) - These extensive still galleries are divided into four sections: \\"Character Design,\\" \\"Layouts & Backgrounds,\\" \\"Visual Development\\" and \\"Publicity.\\" There are over 100 images, including both conceptual art and more fully-rendered drawings. (Note there is also a \\"Play All\\" function that will automatically advance you through all the stills in the gallery.)<br /><br />Documentary: \\"The Pixar Story\\" (HD, 1:28:30) - Directed by Academy Award-winning filmmaker Leslie Iwerks, this is a fantastic documentary on the history of Pixar Studios, narrated by Stacy Keach. The entire birth and growth of the copmany is chronicled, from their beginnings in 1979, through early experimental shorts and commercials, to the juggernaut we know now today. Fresh interviews are included with all of Pixar's chief artists, as well as such luminaries as Roy Disney, Tom Hanks and Steve Jobs.<br /><br />Vignette: \\"Wall-E's Treasures & Trinkets\\" (HD, 4:54) - The \\"Robots\\" section begins with this montage of Wall-E doing cute little things.<br /><br />Sneak Peek : \\"Wall-E's Tour of the Universe\\" (HD, 1 minute) - This mock preview spot is a cute promo for the [...] website.<br /><br />\\"Lots of Bots\\" Storybook (HD) - Games, puzzles, narrated by John Ratzenberger and Kathy Najimy.<br />Bot Files (HD 9:04) - A gallery of 28 different robots seen in the film. Each robot gets a 360-degree visual spin with a narrator filling us in on some interesting facts about the machine.

The DisneyFile copy is compatible with PCs, PSP and iTunes.<br /><br />Blu-ray Bonus Content:<br /><br />Cine-Explore Mode - Director Andrew Stanton's solo audio commentary is presented here with additional picture-in-picture information. Stanton jumps right in and immediately tackles the more controversial environmental and political criticisms of the film. He covers his original ideas for the core story, the development of the Wall-E and supporting robot characters, and some of the substantial changes made to the second and third acts as the production progressed. PIP information features a wide range of material, including storyboards, enlargements of small visual details seen in the film, and filmmaker photos and data. Even in audio-only form (there is an option to turn off the PIP portion) this is a great commentary.<br /><br />Geek Talk, Trash Talk & Trivia (HD) - A second visual commentary is offered with a quartetof 'Wall-E' filmmakers: Character team supervisor Bill Wise, co-producer Lindsay Wallace, story artist Derek Thompson and lead animator and story consultant Angus McClain. The four participants are seen via silhouette on the bottom right of the screen (as if you are watching the movie in a theater with them). This is a boisterous, even goofy track, with the four riffing off all sorts of pop culture references and insider stories on what's appearing on-screen. It's perhaps not as articulate and insightful in terms of story and character as Stanton's track, as the group largely comments on visual gags, animation secrets and other technical tidbits.<br /><br />3-D Set Fly-Throughs (HD, 10:38) - Found on disc two (under the \\"Humans\\" section), click this feature and an interactive map of the Axiom spaceship appears.

B001AII4TA|3.0|I've seen the movie before and it's great.    I have trouble getting it to play on my LG BH200, which I understand is a problem with the player, not necessarily the disc; however, none of my other Blu-Ray discs seem to have any problems being played on the BH200.    The issues with this movie and the BH200 are known and hopefully LG can fix this with a firmware upgrade.
031606792X|2.0|I really enjoyed reading the other books in this series, but I couldn't even finish this final book.  It was not only boring, but just didn't give me anything to relate to.  The previous 3 books had deeper messages that anyone could identify with.  This book really had nothing.  The author did want to wrap everything up with a pretty bow, which made the book quite stale.  I skipped ahead a little to verify what I already knew would happen, and finally gave up.  I am sad that the series had to end for me on such a negative note.
B0000042MY|5.0|I love the central theme of this soundtrack.  Depending on the arrangement, it can be romantic, sad, patriotic, and thrilling.  For anyone learning to score films, this one offers a great lesson on arrangements.  Another good film scorer is Howard Shore.  His themes for Lord of the Rings trilogy are also fantastically arranged for different moods.
0143038419|5.0|This book was suggested to me by my friend, since she had recommended it I was expecting a story that I would enjoy.  Before I finished the third page, I was in love.  Gilbert's voice as a narrator is one of the most charming and engaging I've ever encountered, she shares with you her personal quest in such a way that also offers insight into your own life.  I borrowed the book from the library first, but ordered it online soon after because this is definitely a book I'm going to want to read again.

0810993139|5.0|I am currently a student teacher in a 3rd grade classroom.  Several weeks ago we had a bookfair at school.  One set of books that EVERY other student walked out of the fair with were these wimpy kid books.  I figured if that many of them wanted them then  I probably should get a copy for my classroom.    In my classroom everyday the students are read a chapter of a book.  About 3 weeks ago we finished Because of Winn Dixie and we needed to start a new one.  The students were very vocal that they wanted to read this book.  Every day they can not wait to be read to and they never want me to stop reading.  The students who have the book keep their copy at school so they can follow along and look at the pictures, which are so funny.  I find both myself and my classroom teacher chuckling at several of the things in this book.  They want us to continue with the blue one, when we finish the red one.    I definetly recomend this book, kids LOVE IT.

B001FB4W0W|3.0|It was fascinating---at first---to watch the Sookie Stackhouse books brought to life.  Her developing relationship with the vampire Bill was wonderfully compelling, and Eric's strength of character is flawless.        Unfortunately, an excessive amount of time is spent on unappealing secondary characters, and the main characters consistently get lost in a lot of tedious filler.        As well, the show's writers need to collaborate.  The inconsistencies that keep showing up have turned Sookie into a wishy-washy, unlikeable person who changes the facts to suit her mood.       *SPOILERS*  She's in love and makes love with Bill, then flirts and makes out with Sam in the next episode.  Wasn't she supposed to be uncomfortable kissing one man and then moving on to another?  As well, to work that scene into the show, Sookie states that Bill is more concerned with politics than with her---yet she knows his absence has nothing to do with politics.  Geez!  He's on trial for staking another vampire to save her life, and she's supposedly aware of that fact.       The writers need to read the blogs.  The show's audience has been objecting---even those who haven't read the books.        Charlaine Harris created a world sufficiently rich, well-paced, and filled with drama.  There's no need for lame side stories and inconsistencies that demean the main characters.  When you try to fix something that isn't broken, inevitably, it deteriorates until it does, in fact, get broken.
0375704027|5.0|Murakami is internationally known for a body of work that encompasses a surreal, dreamy, time-sequence-challenged form of fiction (as well as a number of non-fiction pieces). This novel -- said to be somewhat autobiographical -- is a mesmerizing piece of fiction. Narrated by an adult looking back on an adolescence of confusion and uncertainty, it will certainly trigger knowing nods from its readers. The book is more dramatic than my life (and I suspect more than yours as well), but the deep uncertainty of life in the transition between living at home and making one's way in the world should be familiar to most. Characters in Murakami's books tend to talk a lot and even write letters (how dated!). But they also tell intriguing and believable stories that both anchor them in a specific time and place but also express the universal. A lot in this book is not as it seems. On a superficial level, life is treated as a chore or a bad joke. But what good would it be to have a story that never scratched deeper than an American television prime-time drama into the lives of college students?    Murakami teases us by setting up story lines that never get fully resolved. By this, I don't mean that you have to fill in small details. I mean that people veer off like rockets and you never hear from them again. Or, at best, they are like comets that make recurrent entries into your orbit before being destroyed or escaping forever. People like this are intriguing and stories that include them are somewhat addictive. Suicide makes its way through this book as a reasonable alternative to life. But Murakami craftily asserts again and again that death is part of life and not its opposite. What's hard in life is not avoiding death, but rather living true to your \\"creed\\" or belief system. One of the most effective moments in this moving novel is the scene where the narrator spends a considerable amount of time in a hospital talking to (talking at?) a dying man. This scene is not maudlin, nor is any scene in this book manipulative. The book is an exploration of growth, challenge, stumbling and realignment. If you like this book, you have a lot more Murakami to explore. And if you like this book, you might also like the books of David Mitchell, an English novelist with a strong attraction to Japan and Japanese themes.
B001EYGOEM|5.0|Taylor Swift is an amazing and talented artist. And she has done it again with her new album Fearless. Most of the songs on this album are really good. Some are not as great. Forever & Always is my favorite track.             Go out and buy this album! You won't be dissapointed!
B001GZOJP0|5.0|Blu-Ray plus one of the best super hero movies made makes this movie a really nice pick.
B001GQ2TGA|5.0|I have read reviews of this album (and previous albums by Enya) where people say that Enya needs to pick some new instruments, write more complex music, and choose a new orchestra. These reviewers of Enya's work are simply not listening! Enya IS the instrument. Enya, quite simply, IS the orchestra. In spite of how airy and light her sound may seem, I urge you to turn this album up just a notch louder and listen to what you think is an orchestra or instrumentation on many of the songs. Don't forget that what you are hearing is Enya's own voice; layered and layered with great skill to achieve a remarkable, unified sound. No other artist in our time does this (layering the voice up to 20 times or more to create one pitch) with the uncanny talent that Enya has. It may all sound simple- but it is something that is very hard to pull off without sounding like a big mess. Enya has an amazing ability to be able to \\"see the big picture\\" (or \\"hear\\" the big picture) before, during, and after recording. Imagine being able to think of your own voice in several layers all at once- and then use those layers to build a single note and even a complete song. Suddenly there is a lot of complexity in the seemingly simple work that Enya creates!    And what a beautiful album Enya has crafted for us here. I don't find this to be an overly commercial Christmas album at all; in fact I commend Enya for including \\"the reason for the season\\" many times. The first song that she sings on this album, \\"Journey of the Angels,\\" is all about angels bringing gifts to the Christ Child on Christmas morning. If you listen carefully to this song, you will notice that much of what you are hearing- sounds that at first listed seem to be violin, cello, and bass- are actually those beautifully layered and crafted notes that Enya creates with her own voice. Other songs on the CD, both new and classic (such as O Come, O Come, Emmanuel and Oiche Chiuin or Silent Night) continue to mention- in a gentle way- thatChrist is the reason for celebrating Christmas; not going out to party and buy expensive gifts. I generally do not like Christmas albums because they are typically secular (in other words, commercial) and never mention Christ at all. THANK YOU Enya for being daring enough to include the true meaning of Christmas on this album! (Incidentally, Enya's new version of Silent Night is listed on the album as being a \\"chorale\\" version- again, the entire chorus is made up of that skillful layering and merging of Enya's own voice!)    Enya fans will not be put off by the fact that this IS a Christmas album- you can listen to it year round as that it is as lush and beautiful as all of Enya's albums. I particularly like the quiet nature of the album- many songs have the feel of snowflakes drifting over the ground; or the feel of stars on a crisp Winter night. That is another skill that Enya carries off with beauty- being able to create a feeling and a \\"picture\\" of Winter with her music. I feel that her musical vision is lost on many listeners- but many great artists who are visionary in their work are looked over by an audience that just can not understand or see their vision. Thank God that Enya still shares her vision and her fine craft with those of us who do hear what she has to say.
B001AKTZPK|3.0|After re-purchasing every Creedence album in the JVC 20 bit analog remaster format, I was upset when, lo and behold, the albums are released again with bonus tracks.  First of all, I am still blown away by the sound of the JVC remaster, which I thought was vastly superior to any other method and actually tried to capture the \\"bottom layers\\" of vinyl that CD's simply lack. So is this the same, or did they re-remaster?  Then I looked at the majority of the bonus cuts across the catalog and realized they're from Europe '71.  Are these different versions than those on the already remasterd live disc, or are they the same?  Should I buy the earlier albums again for the live '69 stuff only to find a new release of the entire Fillmore show down the road.  What about the Booker T. stuff- why spread it across albums unless it's for profit?  Should I feel like I'm being manipulated?
1416562591|4.0|I have seen a lot of reviews of this book here claiming how harsh it is and that it is not a realistic protrayal of modern India. I thought Adiga's depiction was very realistic and he portrayed modern India with a lot of honesty. Hailing from a middle class or upper middle class family in India I can see how the underclass there is completely ignored and that their stories never make it to the surface. Having lived outside of India has definitely opened my mind how all people can be equal or almost equal in a society. I am really glad that finally there is a truthful novel that doesn't necessarily talk about elitist, English bred intellectual characters.
0307269752|5.0|Since the plot of this book has been described in detail in other reviews, I will refrain from that in my review.  Upon reflection, after finishing this book, I decided that part of its appeal lies in the fact that many if not most of human drives and emotions are present somewhere in the story:  greed. lust, love, revenge, sadism, sloth, political extremism, fear, and deceit, among others.  The author combines all these good and bad human traits into a lyrically-written mystery with overtones of irony and undercurrents of violence.  The book is well-organized, too, which makes it eminently readable.  There is a flow to the words that is addictive:  when you add that to the story, the result is a marvelous read.  It's tragic that the author passed away several years ago, although I understand several additional books may be published.  I hope some of the same characters are in the later books, too.
B0011NVC98|4.0|Ok - I will admit that Angelina Jolie was a big draw, but I would have seen this movie any ways. The graphics/cgi in this movie are great. real cool. I think these are the most realistic CGI people I've ever seen. I vaguely remembered reading the original Beowulf way back when. From the extras they say this is a little different take on the original. This is a real good story, there is a lot of skill that went into bringing the characters and story to life. The battle/fight scenes are excellent, and it's got good drama and an interesting story that kept my attention all the way through. I really enjoyed this. Totally entertaining.
0743289684|5.0|Wow, you can't put this book down!  It reads like an action/suspense/thriller!  Wow, I hope someone will turn this into a film soon.  She is the Anne Frank of our generation.

0143038419|4.0|I was loaned this book from a neighbor who also told me that the author was a selfish, self absorbed sorry excuse for a woman...but she also added it is very interesting because of her travels...Thus began the love hate relationship for this book...<br />The authors style is witty but sometimes on the verge of droning.  You want to read more about the mozzarella but then you endure through the self pity.  The descriptions of Rome are enchanting as are the thoughts of leaving your life to simply learn a new language and indulge in a romantic culture, but then thoughts of ex-boyfriends, ex-husbands ,depression and then the wakeup call of \\"oh yeah I actually have a real life and it would be practically impossible strike that IMPOSSIBLE to actually be able to take 4 months and move to some place of my wishes just because I can't take it anymore\\"....<br />O.K. enough of the self pity in the book I think you get that already...I give it four stars simply because it allowed me to escape to that place that would be fun and maybe I have dreamt of, but I know I'll never do, nor want to do.  She does explore those selfish ambition thoughts that creep into the mind of any young woman under the pressures of modern day society and she actually justifies them - well at least in her own mind she does.  The book contains delightful insights and tips into cultures I will only dream of visiting and in the end I think she makes the reader grateful for your own normal or maybe not so normal life...At least maybe more normal than hers anyway.  It would be interesting to see if her acquired self-peace actually sustains through a relationship on four different continents...somehow I wouldn't be surprised to find out in the end of her life or at least her current relationship she finds herself back on the bathroom floor sobbing.
0156030209|3.0|I ventured out of my usual kind of reads for this book because of all the hype. It sounded kinda interesting. When I read the blurbs on it, I was expecting some kind of big epiphany from it. I'm disappointed in it, it was just a weird story that dragged on, and the back and forth in time thing was confusing. I've read other books with that technique that flowed well and were easy to follow. I am giving it three stars because Mr. Martel can obviously write, no shortage of talent there. There is also a decent amount of creativity in his book. The third star is me admitting that I bought this book because of the hype, so I won't punish it because it's not my usual taste. Honestly, the story is not that interesting, a lot of the scenes seemed pointless, and the big message of the book comes across weak and contrived. Like someone shoved it in hoping it would leave you in awe. It doesn't. I really don't get the big hoopla here. Wasn't time well-spent for me.
0807126063|5.0|I'm hoping I'll find a funnier book - life can always be a little bit better!  But I'm not greedy.  Between the cast of characters, each a gem, to the almost unbearable richness of the odiousness of the main character himself, to sentences like \\"Patrolman Mancuso's love of the motorcycle was platonically intense.\\", I don't know what else I could ask for.  Oh, I know.   Amnesia.  I could ask for amnesia.
B001GKJ2DO|5.0|It's apparent the naysayers who give this movie a less than 5 star rating have never experienced a first and true love.  This feel-good movie tells viewers that even though their first love may have faltered, it was beautifull all the same!    So sad these negative critics have missed such an experience.  If they hadn't, they would have enjoyed this movie and understood it's message.

B001F12J48|1.0|The anaglyph 3D used here is absolutely JUNK - worse than anything I have seen, and certainly not of the usually high standards of WB Home Video. This is a MAJOR faux-pas for Warner Home Video, and a complete rip off for consumers. Double images, not depth. I urge Warner Bros. to go back and re-issue this in proper 3D form, similar to the \\"Journey to the Centre of the Earth\\", and let consumers get a replacement disc. What a way to kill the value of this great catalog title!    Despite the novelty, AVOID AT ALL COSTS!
0385340567|1.0|After reading this book I wonder if Lee Child is done with Jack Reacher. It's been a good run for Child, but I don't know if he has anything left.  This book is bad. The plot is boring, Reacher's wanderings are tedious, the bad guy is lame, the plot is ridiculous, and Child need to do some actual research about brain dramaged people and war deserters.     Don't waste your time with this book. Read an old Reacher novel and have a good time. Child needs a visit from Jack Reacher to straighten him out after this utterly disappointing effort.

B001GAPC1K|5.0|As a diehard comic collector (specifically Marvel titles), I am always apprehensive about movies based on superheros. But with Iron Man, they got it almost perfect. Even my wife, who doesn't necessarily like superhero movies, thoroughly enjoyed this one. Great job Marvel! Now if only you could acquire Spider-Man and do it justice for the next few installments! Can't wait for the Avengers! How about a Moon Knight movie?
B001KVZ6BG|5.0|SAW THIS MOVIE IN NYC ON 11/15 AND, TO PUT IT IN A WORD: INCREDIBLE!    SHOCKING, TOUCHING AND AS AN INDIAN, KNOW A LOT OF THE TOPICS TO BE TOO CLOSE FOR COMFORT.    BEGGING CHILDREN FOR EXAMPLE ARE NOT ACCIDENTS.  EVERYONE THERE KNOWS THAT.    IF YOU CAN STOMACH THE TRUTH, SEE IT.    MANY A TRUE WORD........    DON'T BE SURPRISED IF IT STEALS YOUR HEARTS AND AN OSCAR.    ====================================    updated 01/14/09    From the perspective of someone who was born in India, grew up there and fled, take it from me, this movie accurately depicts what goes on there and the plight of those whose parents are snatched away by senseless violence.    Inspite of it all, nothing can stamp out the human spirit.    I saw it a day after it opened in NYC and predicted it would sweep the awards.  Not surprisingly, it did, at the Golden Globes. 4 out of 4.    If you want to see the real India, truthfully portrayed, watch this movie.  It makes even Totsi seem pale in comparason.  It is brilliantly put together in a way that will capture your imagination, kidnap it for about 2 hours, have your head reeling on a roller coaster of emotions then release you at the end.    Merficully, when the credits roll, we are cleverly reminded that this was ONLY a movie.... and our heart rates slow down.    Go experience India in a way no other movie director had the courage or imagination to show the world until now!

B000Z1LOBI|5.0|I have loved testament over the years. This release is very different, heavy but like deathmetal combined.  But this does not change the way of how good the album is. chuck billy still knows what he is doing. If you like deathmetal and thrash put together you will love this album.
0307455874|5.0|It was after reading this book that I realized that I had to do everything within my power to ensure that Barack Obama was elected President of the United States.<br /><br />There are two kinds of people in the world - those who know how to dream, and those who donot. For those of us who do, this book was a set of important guidelines on what this country could be. It took dreamers to create this great society, and it will take a dreamer and a man of action to get us out of the quagmire we're in today.<br /><br />It was a long shot, but just like millions of other Americans, I knew that if the rest of the country got to know Barack Obama the way I'd taken the time to do, they would elect him president, and they did. If you don't support your newly elected president, that's okay. This country is great because we have the freedom to disagree, even with our most important leaders. But if you love this country at all, then you have to know that there's a movement afoot, one that will take us into a shining new future, one that involves all Americans taking control of their own civic lives, and working together across racial and political lines to do what's best for the country.<br /><br />Anyone that doesn't want to be a part of that? Pretty sad.

B001EYGOEM|1.0|Taylor is a beautiful girl and a great role model for young girls everywhere. I am impressed with her songwriting ability for her young age, but she does need to diversify her writing efforts into other areas than teenage romantic melodrama. That being said, I am still not a fan of this young ladies voice...live, her voice is pitchy and incredibly out of tune, on this cd she sounds strained and trying to push her voice where it isn't meant to go. She may have a career in the record industry (amazing what computer enhancement can do) , but  I don't see this young lady having a long lasting career until she gets some serious vocal lessons.
B001EZ78T6|4.0|I love John Legend, but wasn't a big fan of his last album.  I do, however really like this one.  It has a more relaxed sound, not as in 'adult contemporary' but like he, as an artist, has slowed down and made something he really believed in.    \\"If You're Out There\\" is the theme song on 2008 for me, and I played it all day the day after the election :)
B000002HPV|5.0|I love this album, but I don't feel like talking about it; instead, I was looking through what other people think of this album, and I came across the stupidest review I ever read on Amazon.  Here it is so you don't have to look for it:<br /><br />'This artist is really INSANE! If some so-called artists called this music \\"art\\" they're really wrong and crazy. I've been listening Bjork's music a lot of times and I couldn't find an answer to his physically disordered mind. This album gives you a clear idea of how A DISORDERED MIND can produce music.<br />Do not listen this music unless you have no sense of art and human spirit. This is not what european people listen everyday. Don't be fooled by the idea this is art-music. Go somewhere else, like Beethoven or Vivaldi music. Take this CD to trash!'<br /><br />Wow, I can't say enough about this review, except for really bad grammar skills, and that anyone who thinks Bjork is a guy probably should just stay away from anything that doesn't sound like Nickelback.
B000001ELP|5.0|This is my second replacement of the original 45! There's not a typical KISS song on the entire CD. Very glad they did a movie soundtrack. The whole thing tells a story that a little bit of imagination will probably make better than the movie it was made for.
B0019T9FL6|3.0|I love American Idol, and I voted for Jennifer Hudson to go thru to the finals. So I had to order her CD. It's awesome!!
B0007YN76S|2.0|After reading \\"the Undomestic Goddess\\" and \\"Can you keep a secret?\\" which are some of the later books of Kinsella I thought I'll just give the book that shoot her to fame a try. I must admit that the title had put me off for quite some time because it just sounded so silly. But I thought that maybe that was just the title. Well, the book is kind of silly at a whole. I know these chic lit books don't set out to use symbolism or to deal with political issues, their humble goal seems to be to entertain us readers and most of the time they do. But I believe there is a very fine line when funny and chic becomes ridiculous and over the top. While the later books of Kinsella seem to stay on the right side of that line this one doesn't.     Don't get me wrong, this book will make laugh sometimes and it definitely has a few moments but the shopping and stupidity of Becky, the main character is excessive and boring. Where the main characters of the later books of Kinsella didn't have their life in order in a fun way, Becky just comes off as dumb and hard to sympathize with.     This is an ok book that might keep you slightly humored but the later books of Kinsella are much better and I would recommend them before this one.
045122499X|5.0|An amazingly real biography of a time so far away!  This story will envelop you to the very end!  Although it ties in with Pillars of the Earth, it functions brilliantly as a novel in its own right.  Own it, Read it, LOVE IT!
B00002ND77|4.0|I could easily have given this movie five stars on the acting alone. But I had to take out one star for a few inaccuracies in the movie plus the movie left out certain elements in his life that I felt were important(like his speech to the Africans in Africa that the blacks in America had the same struggle that they had) but dont mistake my tone because I still recommend it flaws and all.<br /><br />Malcolm X details the life of the controversial yet charismatic figure that sought to deal with the injustices that African people suffered in America. It details how he came up from being a petty street hustler to the Nation Of Islam most outspoken character. It also deals with the events that lead to his assassination.<br /><br />Denzel Washington's best performance was here and what does he win an award for? Training Day. Now do you see why they say these awards mean nothing? Denzel role as Malcolm X is just as flawless as Will Smith's role of Muhammed Ali. I still get goosebumps when I hear him speak and Ive seen a lot of Malcolm X's actual speeches. Angela Bassett did a great job as his wife and the supporting actors and actresses were great too. My gripe is the certain inaccuracies in the movie and the idea that the Nation Of Islam has something to do with his death is debatable. As far as I'm concerned those guys were flunkies for those people in high places. If not by signature then by nature. At any rate I would still recommend this movie, flaws and all, to anybody that is interested but first read up on his life before you watch this movie. Kudos to Spike Lee for doing his best with the information he was given.<br /><br />Rest in Peace Malcolm X.
0446579939|2.0|I love Nicholas Sparks' writing style immensely.  However, I am getting a little bored with his stories.  They are great love stories as individuals, but after reading book after book of his, you come to realize that all the stories will follow one simple theme.  He is trying to be different but it all ends up the same.  My favorites so far have been The Notebook, A Walk To Remember, and Nights in Rodanthe for their unexpected-ness.  A tear jerker this was not, but again and easy read if you are looking for something to fill your time.
B001GQSY5U|2.0|Star Wars Clone Wars is the pre-emptive effort to do two things;  Capitalize on Star Wars a movie franchise and to send out a major introduction to the Star Wars animated series on Cartoon Network.     Clone Wars relies on the fact that the audience who loved the latest trilogy will really like this version of Star Wars, and they probably do.  It's full of action and light hearted jokes and some hip dialogue that only young people use.  The movie starts strong, with a great action sequence with Anakin Skywalker and Obi Wan Kenobi defending a city from the droid army under Count Dooku.  The plot extends to show Dookus plan to kidnap Jabba the Hutt's son in order to frame the Jedi and win favor for shipping routes in the outer rim.    As it moves on the movie keeps its pace and is entertaining, but somewhere in the middle they seemed to realize they forgot about Queen Amidala and new story line is born.  This seems to drag the movie down and slow the pacing.  Not that it's a bad story line but it's not integrated well and things kind of deteriorate.  The animation is strange at first, it looks like the characters are all carved from wood, but you get used to it after a while and realize it's very good.    In all, it's a decent movie.  There weren't any high expectations, it's Star Wars after all.  I will say that in many respects as far as dialogue and acting go, it's quite surpasses the live movie trilogy.  I think good old Uncle George (Lucas) doesn't realize that the die hard fans from the original trilogy aren't that interested in the Adventures of Anakin during the Clone Wars once we found out how he because Darth Vader.    This movie is good rental and a decent venture in an official Star Wars movie that WASN'T directed by Uncle George, who seems to have lost touch with the original audience of his success.  I can only hope that he will let more young directors take the helm and writing duties for future projects.  There is a lot of talent out there who adore the original trilogy and the basics of the new stories that could breath serious life into the franchise.

B001GKJ2FW|5.0|Mamma Mia is a feel good story, I have seen the production in Las Vegas and New York City and can easily recommend this to anyone.  The music and story just flow together naturally.
B000AU9UYC|4.0|When I first went into the theaters to see this film I was hesitant in the knowledge that this film could of been a really good film, upstaging previous films or it could of been a poor excuse of a Batman movie, in which, the studio was trying to sqeeze every penny out of people as humanly possible before leaving the once great Batman to rest.  However, I found the theartical movie very well done.  Which leads me to this DVD version of Batman Begins.           I found this DVD a well contrived movie in which there was a well written orgin story about what happened to Bruce Wayne and why he choose to become Batman.  Furthermore, The editing of this movie seemed to be well done because the entire movie did flow well and as an audience member was able the follow what was going on without having to guess what was happening from scene to scene because of poorly done editing, which has been done before in other films not related to this one.  On another note, the acting in this movie was well done and gave more life to the storyline and the characters that were involved with it.  Overall, I found this film one of the few movies that has come out of Hollywood to be truly worth my time to watch the first time and worthy to be watched more than once.
B001F290E4|5.0|This CD is great! Seal and David Foster make an awesome team. I know Here I Am Come And Take Me was an Al Green song originally, but I grew up hearing the UB40 version on the radio. Thanks Seal for a much better cover, sung by someone with an appropriate voice for that classic.    My favorite tracks:  It's A Man's Man's Man's World  A Change Is Gonna Come  I Can't Stand The Rain  Here I Am Come And Take Me
B0014Z4OQG|5.0|I would recommend this movie to anyone who is a Sherlock Holmes/thriller movie lover. You follow a group of individuals around the streets of NYC, both above and below ground, as they escape the unknown monster wreaking havoc on the city. This movie is filled with suspense and a little bit of blood and gore. It is shot from the perspective of a handheld camera, which helped to increase the drama already present. This movie is not for people who dislike jumping in their seats.
B001F0VHEM|5.0|Well, this won't be as wordy as OTHER reviews,  but I thought it was great.  It seemed to have some emotion, some great beats and some fun lyrics.      So, buy it.  If you like Pink, you probably won't be upset that you did!
B000AM2L1O|5.0|My 18 month old daughter loves this baby!  It is very huggable and appropriate for a small child.  My daughter carries it everywhere, kissing and hugging it.  She puts it to bed and tries to feed it.  She is very intrigued by the closing eyes. I spent a lot of time trying to find the right doll, and this one is just perfect for her.  It is just the right size for small arms.
B000FBGBPC|5.0|What can I say about this band? AWESOME!!!!!!!! Their music and lyrics are just so awesome!!!!!! I love hearing Adam's voice when he sings. If you ever have depression... you can always listen to this band. I recommand Never Too Late and One-X. Those are my favorite songs! I really love all of the songs on here! This band has changed people's lives. That's why I love this band! Whenever I feel sad... I'll always listen to them. They are really awesome live too! I really love it when Adam sings Alice in Chains's Rooster in concert. He's awesome!!!! Three Days Grace will be there for you if you're ever feeling down and need to listen to some good rock music. \\"Maybe we'll turn it all around cause it's not too late... it's never too late.\\"
B000YENUI6|4.0|Brutal yet artful, subtle yet gripping, \\"Eastern Promises\\" packs dynamite in the story, acting, and directing departments.  Director David Cronenberg and his new favorite lead actor Viggo Mortensen (they previously teamed up to make \\"A History of Violence\\") return to tell a gripping story of the Russian mob in London, and how fate brings the mob into contact with an ordinary family who suddenly finds itself with the power to bring the mob hierarchy down.  Mr. Cronenberg doesn't shy away from the brutality of mob violence, but he doesn't linger on it, either.  Still, the movie isn't for squeamish viewers.<br /><br />Two short but satisfying special features round out the DVD: a seven-or-eight minute piece that features the director and actors talking about the film, and a seven-or-eight minute piece about the history and role of the elaborate criminal tattoos featured in the film.  Combined, you get a good fifteen minutes or so of satisfying behind-the-scenes information.  For most films, that's actually enough for me when it comes to special features.  My widescreen DVD featured crisp, clear picture and sound.<br /><br />In you enjoy films in the organized crime genre, you'll probably like \\"Eastern Promises\\" a lot.  It has all the elements one expects to see in this type of film, but also throws you a few curves, too.
B000U7169M|4.0|Ok, let's be honest -- this is not a good film.  It's not an ok film.  And it's not a bad film.<br /><br />To me this is a film like, say, Roadhouse, Tremors or, I don't know -- Wild in the Streets? -- that is so irredeemably out there, so vividly rendered in just a straightaway un-ironic fashion, that it transcends its mere badness and actually becomes a fun, highly enjoyable guilty pleasure.<br /><br />This is really a perfect B-film -- Hilary Swank plays it rigidly straight as the rational scientist even as she encounters increasingly absurd happenings that could only be the Devil's handiwork.  Her sidekick is a gonner right from the get-go; the hunky sheriff in the bayou is hilarious, along with his overgrown gothic mansion right out of Forrest Gump; the townspeople and the local vigilante killing party are like some deluded crew from Doc Hollywood -- I really just enjoyed all of it.<br /><br />If there was the slightest smirk, snark, or wink this film would just be pretty lousy.  As it is it is a fun, solid B-movie thriller, the kind that has you talking back to the characters, discussing plot points with your friends, and eager to see it again.
B00125WAWS|4.0|\\"The Great Debaters\\" is the story of an unlikely team of black debaters in 1930s Texas. Coming from little-known Wiley College, they go on to compete with the best debating clubs in the land. The film gives a heart-stopping portrayal of the violence and intimidation faced by American Americans during the period. A lynching scene is especially harrowing. It was an era when lynching was commonplace and a pig-farming white man could get away with intimidating a black PhD. Great performances from Denzel Washington and Forrest Whittaker as the debate coach and college chaplain. Wonderful supporting roles from the rest of the cast. The writing is first rate, making it seem cool and exciting to pull quotes from Thoreau, Hughes and Gandhi out of your head. There were a number of interesting subplots that wove their way through the narrative. Denzel's character organized laborers on the side; a lakeside shack serves as blues/gospel hangout. A requisite love story between two of the debaters took the steam off the film's intellectual bent.<br /><br />(Spoilers)<br /><br />Some concerns. Trying to communicate to a 21st century audience the razor's edge walked by 1930s blacks was mishandled. Given the dangerous times they lived in, the black debaters were almost militant in their arguments. Even a northern university audience might have been alarmed at the veiled threats being made. Then too, the movie erred in following the standard \\"Remember The Titans\\" cinematic model in which Denzel leads an unlikely team to beat the best in the league. Sticking closer to history, in which Wiley was less than completely victorious in the literal sense would have been more accurate. Perhaps the movie makers didn't think we could handle the truth that progress for blacks in the 1930s was gained a tiny step at a time. And that audiences can appreciate the import of symbolic victory.<br /><br />Still, I found \\"The Great Debaters\\" to be riveting and watchable. The DVD extras, in which Denzel interviews elderly Wiley College grads gave texture into a difficult era. A great weekend family (teen and up) film and great to show your high school debate club.llege grads gave texture into a difficult era.

B001EOQWF8|5.0|This movie was very very good. It is a shame most will view it as a kids movie when it is very smart, very intelligent. If you can't come out of this movie thinking to yourself that this is exactly what the future of this planet could look like with how wasteful and irresponsible we are, you are definitely in need of a dose of reality. Recommended for all intelligent people and their children, even though most children will just think it is a silly robot.
0765316897|5.0|From the dust jacket summary of this book, I was not expecting much.  However, this final book in the Mistborn series blew me away.  Aside from some slow pacing in some chapters, the book was thrilling to read-I couldn't put it down and wound up finishing the book in three days.  Sanderson answers all lingering questions from the other two books in this final book, often leaving this reader scratching his head at the sheer creative genius of his fantasy innovations.  Personally, unlike some reviewers, I enjoyed the religious connotations of the book (all fantasy writers create a world, as it were, and shouldn't shy away from including such a common societal structure as religion as a basic element in their worlds).  Moreover, the religious undertone is not overbearing.  Rather, it is insightful, providing a thoughtful twist on the classic fantasy theme of good versus evil.  Sanderson is an author with tremendous potential-I look forward to reading future books from him.
B001FBSMW6|4.0|I have listened to this album about 20 times so far, and while at first I didn't care for it, upon listening to it a couple more times, it started to grow on me.      The band is growing, they are trying new things, and this is all good news. The worst thing a band can do is be stagnant and have all of their albums sound the same. A couple of tracks on the album are reminiscent of what we know and love of Keane, however the album as a whole is a different sound.     I think overall, if you enjoy the band, you will like the album and the songs, they are written well, the lyrics are powerful (as always), and the orchestration is often clever.
1400064287|5.0|\\"Made to Stick\\" is one of those rare books that just makes you look at everything you write in a fresh light.

B001F7MSFW|4.0|\\"Hellboy II\\", ably directed by Guillermo Del Toro, picks up where the last film left off -- Hellboy is still working for a super-secret government agency in charge of cleaning up (and covering up) supernatural events. And he's still a rebel, blowing things up and punching folks out as the mood strikes him.  Del Toro and his crew clearly had a lot of fun making this, with a flippant, what-the-heck attitude coming through in every scene. The film cheerfully references \\"Lord Of The Rings,\\" \\"Indiana Jones,\\" \\"The Mummy\\" and any number of action-y movies -- including Del Toro's own work, with some demons that look an awful lot like the creepy guys in \\"Pan's Labyrinth.\\" The easygoing air of not taking things too seriously makes this enjoyable, although the Hellboy series still seems to be finding its legs in some ways, particularly with the characters finding their voices... Selma Blair's Liz character still seems a bit flat, and Ron Perlman occasionally seems to be phoning in his scenes, but Doug Jones steals the show as the aquatic C3PO-ish Abe, and a new character -- the ectoplasmic, half-robotic group leader Krauss -- is a fascinating addition to Hellboy's Scooby Gang. Another sequel is sure to follow, particularly since we've been given tantalizing glimpses of HB's hellish royal lineage. This installment was entertaining -- I'm sure HB3 will be fun as well!  (Joe Sixpack, Slipcue film reviews)
B000056N8X|4.0|This movie came out in when I was about 13 and a huge fan of Highlander: The Series and the original movie that spawned the entire franchise.  History, swordplay, martial arts, philosophy, and good principal actors.  To this day I have fond memories of being entertained by the HL franchise.      Endgame is the third of four sequels to the original movie, none of which can truly be called sequels.  Highlander II: The Quickening betrays the premise of the original movie, Highlander III: The Sorcerer returns to the premise but ignores the Series (which ignores the events of the original movie, but not the premise), aside from being a mediocre imitation of the original. The Series, on the other hand, is where the whole franchise reaches its zenith and, in my opinion, surpasses the original film in scope, with a rich mythos and a world of interesting characters.    Endgame doesn't reach the heights of the best of the series, but isn't as bad as its worst episodes.  All in all, it can be seen as a high budget, feature length episode of the series.  Thematically, everything in the movie (besides a storyline featuring Connor) has been played out more or less in the series.  The flashbacks are convincing but, again, not nearly as compelling as the best of the series.  The story arch and mythos could only be appreciated by fans of the franchise, so by itself it has little strength.  The movie also falls short of its own potential; the original script and alternate cuts reveal a somewhat different movie.     By itself, it is far better than many sci-fi cult movies, but the best of Highlander is the best of the series.  If Davis and Panzer ever wish to make a feature film that rivals the series, somebody needs to seriously reflect on what made the franchise successful in the first place.      The DVD itself is high quality and highly entertaining, though.  It includes an entire alternate cut and interesting production features.  The soundtrack is also quite good--I made a pointof re-purchasing it this year after losing my original copy.

0525478183|5.0|Paper Towns mostly takes place in Orlando, Florida. The setting is described in a way any teenager would talk about growing up in their home town: They find it boring and look forward to making there own fun or trouble. Q, or Quentin, is a bit obsessed with fellow classmate and neighbor Margo Roth Speigelman. A girl who Q and friends are finding to be more of a mystery by the day.<br />The story is about realizing you never really know a person, you just think you do. The plot's similar to another of John Green's books, Looking For Alaska, but done in a different light - as more of a quest, where Alaska was about a learning experience. To find the mystery that is Margo, Q goes on a scavenger hunt. Literally, and you can follow the clues along with Q to find Margo. I think the characters and setting feel pretty natural and will sit well with teens.<br />This is a book not just for teens, though. It will be enjoyable for adults as well. There are some strong language and sexuality explicit scenes, but not as bad a as Looking for Alaska. It is a book with a lot of humor, mystery and intrigue. I highly recommend it.
B001DUJNGS|1.0|I have all of Enigma's albums since the begining and he has been one of my favorite artists since he came out in 1990, I was in high school at the time. I have fallen in love with this style of music and have since bought all of B-Tribe's albums, the first Deep Forest, Delerium, all of Enya's, etc. But ever since \\"Cross of Changes\\" Enigma has gone down a path that I have found hard to follow. I see people writing about how creative he is and all that, and sure, nobody else really sounds that much like him anymore, but is that a good thing? Every album he has come out with since then has been more of the same. More of the male screaming lyrics, less of the sultry sexy female lyrics usually in French or Latin, more of the electric guitar and less of the flutes and strings. I loved Enigma back when he was making sexy music, now it is just some guy yelling all the time. This album is so bad I can only listen to one song, and it is an instrumental (number 10 or 11 I forget). The rest are so bad I can't even play them. What happened to Sadeness, Mea Cupla remixes, The Child In Us, Return to Innocence, Carly's song, Push the Limits, Gravity of Love, all the songs that sounded so deep and sexy? I know you have to be imaginative on each album, but come on, enough with the yelling and beat boxing.
B000002GJ7|4.0|I played the heck of this album when it originally came out. Nuno Bentencourt is truly one of the most amazing musicians to ever pick up an instrument. I loved that that these guys were able to create their songs with amazing guitar parts and really lush harmonies. Every song on this album is musically great. You get a mix of everything from Chillipepper'esque rap/rock (decadent dance), to country rock (hole hearted), and ballads like More than Words, which was a double edged sword for the band.    The one thing that drives me nuts about Extreme has ALWAYS been their lyrics. Some of them were great. Take the 'III Sides album'. Great stuff there, lots of good social commentary. But on 'Pornograffitti', there was all this stupid nursery rhyme, mother goose imagery that made me cringe when it first came out and still does. Unfortunately, those lyrics kind of cheapened this album to me and make it hard to play the album in front of any thinking person.    I still give it high marks and I still get enjoyment out of it, but the lyrics.... oy!
B001DHXT1G|4.0|The blu-ray disc itself is excellent.  I think that Universal is doing a great job of putting together their high definition discs and all of the features.  I'm really impressed with what they put together.  The movie itself is fairly good.  I am one who thought the last movie didn't really deserve all of the negativity that it got.  But this review is about the new movie.  Ed Norton didn't really have a lot of character to mess with here.  He did a good job, but it wasn't exactly American History X where he really got to do a lot.  I thought William Hurt did really well, and Live Tyler did surprisingly well.  I'm looking forward to what ever they do next with the franchise, but frankly, the movie was basically, chase Hulk.  Hulk fight Abomination.  Hulk smash.  I really liked Hulk smash admittedly.  From the deleted scenes, it looked like they were thinking about going into more depth with Liv Tyler's new love interest, and they had some decent material for William Hurt.  In the end, those scenes didn't work, and I understand that.  However, I do think they left some loose ends that could have been tied together with some extra plot-thinking while still providing fodder for future story.  It's a buy, but it's not as good as this year's Iron Man or obviously Batman as superhero movies go.

They de-mystify and expose the correlation between animal proteins and the incidence of cancer in humans.<br /><br />It may come as a shock to learn that dairy products and meats of all kinds (including fish) can dramatically increase the likelihood of getting cancers and heart disease. The balanced diet from the \\"four food groups\\" proffered by the AMA may be a recipe for disaster. Consumption of all animal proteins can lead to a much greater likelihood of getting ill from cancer.<br /><br />What then, plants? Perhaps. Proteins obtained from plants appear to be the answer and, in some cases, can actually reverse some of the ill effects of an animal-rich diet. Who knew the American breakfast of meat, eggs, milk, butter and other animal-based foods could be killing you?<br /><br />I also recommend \\"Eat to Live\\" by Fuhrman who draws from the China Study in his eating handbook to live healthier and lose weight.
B000AP04L0|5.0|Are you fed up with the mindless bureaucracy of your workplace? nauseated with the importance of process over results? anxiety ridden because of your job? then Office Space is the movie for you.  The setting for Office Space is an Information Technology company that processes transactions for Credit Unions, with a collection of employees that are all either bored, angry, aloof, incompetent, anxious or suffer from one of a hundred other maladies or neurotic manifestations.  No doubt this sort of work environment will be familiar to most.<br /><br />It would be convenient to say that this is just another movie about how the corporate work environment drains us of our humanity, but Office Space offers us much more. The mindless bureaucracy, doing work solely to satisfy some inane process (PTS Reports), the sense of detachment from reality is eerily reminiscent of a Kafka novel.  Lundberg, the boss, who is completely unaware of what his employees do and how they feel, endlessly repeats his mantra of ok, ok , while his employees become more and more stressed and unfulfilled.<br /><br />Peter, the lead character, undergoes a profound Peter Pan like psychological transformation after which he is no longer motivated to do his job.  He comes and goes as he pleases and begins to openly express his true feelings about the job and the environment.  His new relaxed attitude impresses the clueless consultants, with their prepackaged prescription for transforming the organization (i.e. reducing headcount), who have been brought in to fine tune the organization.<br /><br />Naturally, no story of this genre would be complete without a love connection between the main character and yet another troubled, trapped soul.  Peter's love interest comes by way of a waitress at a nearby restaurant who fights conformity by wearing only the minimum pieces of flair on her uniform.  She endures the endless questioning from her manager about why she wears only the minimum pieces of flair, when she is so clearly and simply trying to preserve some part of her humanity.<br /><br />The dam of self-control that held the employees in check finally begins to crack when Peter and two of his co-workers hatch a plot of revenge against the company.  Of course their plot like everything else goes badly wrong, but in the end it seems that justice is served.<br /><br />You will laugh out loud, you may cry at times, but if this dark comedy does not send your mind and heart in search of your humanity, sadly you have missed the point.imply trying to preserve some part of her humanity.

B0002EXH4K|3.0|Considered by many as one of the best Megadeth albums, Countdown to Extinction is the band's fifth studio album and their first album to demonstrate an intention to be \\"radio friendly\\".  Like the \\"black\\" album did for Metallica, Countdown to Extinction is also the album that made Megadeth famous to people who weren't already heavy metal fans.    Typically, a \\"radio friendly\\" metal album is synonymous with \\"crap\\", although, for the most part, Megadeth avoided this pitfall with Countdown to Extinction.  Each song is unique and each song has catchy guitar hooks and chorus lines.  The production is commendable as well; every instrument is clear and precise - even the bass guitar - a rare thing when it comes to radio friendly metal.  Lyrically, this is not the band's best, as Dave's words and voice come off a little flat and emotionless.  However, there is a surprising amount of quirky humor in songs such as \\"Sweating Bullets\\" and \\"High Speed Dirt\\".      Fans familiar with the bands previous albums will note that what is missing are the wild, ripping, complex solos of albums like \\"Rust in Peace\\" and \\"Peace Sells...But Whose Buying\\".  In other words, the music on this album is formulaic and simplistic in comparison to the band's prior work...and they continued down this path with subsequent albums up until \\"United Abominations\\".  That is not too say the music is bad...it's enjoyable enough...but just doesn't get my blood pumping like some of their other work.    I recommend that Metal fans who have not yet tried Megadeth get ahold of \\"Rust in Peace\\" or \\"United Abomination\\" before this album.  Those who don't normally listen to Metal, but want to give Megadeth a try, will likely be pleased with what \\"Countdown to Extinction\\" has to offer.
B001EYGOEM|4.0|Taylor Swift's new album is enjoyable when you sit back and just listen to it, but if you really look closely at the lyrics, some songs can get a little old and formulaic.     For example, all she ever sings about is boy-girl relationships, which most artists sing about, but her songs about it still just seem so juvenile. I don't want to be so crtical, because she is just 18, but after hearing how this album was more mature and showed a lot of growth, I thought there would be less about high school/boy drama, but that's not the case.     Also, she mentions so many of the same things/phrases in a lot of her songs, because there are several songs that mention fairytales/princesses, breathing/heartbeats, it being 2 am, and how it was a Tuesday.     All that being said, I still like Taylor Swift, because the songs do have a good sound to them and her voice is great. Standout tracks include \\"Breathe\\" (which I personally think was the strongest on the album because it's jsut so beautiful and I also really like Colbie Caillet, whom she wrote it with), \\"Hey Stephen,\\" \\"Fearless,\\" and \\"The Way I Loved You.\\" I'm also really impressed that she writes all of her songs, because so many artists, especially young ones like her, don't write any of their own music.     Basically, I think she delivered just as solid an album as her first, although I didn't really see much growth like I'd heard. As in her first album, I found that there were several really good standout tracks, while the rest I tend to skip.
B001CZ6CL8|5.0|Every once in a while a magical moment is captured to be shared with everyone. This performance was one such occasion. I will not wax balefully about how good Duane Allman was because it wasn't just his show. The whole band was in the groove and this recording is a testimony to hard work and dedication to one's Craft.<br /><br />What distinguished this band from others is that they ventured into a kind of Jazz/Rock fusion with \\"In Memory Of Elizabeth Read\\" at a time when Fusion was just beginning to get notice. It showed how truly talented the whole band was to be able to do this wonderful piece of music so well composed, and showed that instrumental music when done right is every bit as captivating as standard song forms.<br /><br />Yes, the slide work Duane does here is on a par with pretty much nobody else because he was so good at it. Greg really shows his vocal and playing chops here, too. Great voicings. Dickey and the rest hold down their roles with consumate excellence in every song, whether soloing or comping behind whoever was soloing.<br /><br />This is by far one of the best live recordings and we must be thankful to Bill Graham for having the insight to install the equivalent of a 16 track studio in the Fillmores East & West so these one of a kind performances could be captured. So a tip o' the hat to Bill Graham is needed here, too. Because without his foresight and decidedly progressive vision, we would have none of this to enjoy today.
192076920X|5.0|Picked up the book after hearing two people on the train talking about it and am glad that I did.  His life is fascinating and his prose is beautiful.  His ability to absorb the culture of India and his whereabouts page after page is something to behold.  I cannot see how the movie they are currently making of this will be able to do any justice to the complexities and the wonderful details that are prevalent in this masterpiece, but wish them luck on this endeavor.    You should not be scared by the size of the book, because the story is much larger than the books width.  A truly exceptional read.
7119005901|1.0|First off, I want to make it clear that I respect the people who love and enjoy this novel. I do not think that their opinion of it is somehow \\"wrong.\\"    The following, however, has been my experience:    Among East Asian classics, and among Chinese classics, this novel is one of the least accessible to the average English-speaking reader. The way in which the story is told is extremely dry and downright baffling to someone schooled in Western literature. The writing had no emotional resonance ever.    The lack of emotional resonance is expected, seeing as there's very little description of anything beside physical occurrences, which are summarized in very succinct form. (i.e. Character 435 stabbed Character 762, then rode to [the city of] JFDFSDG and stabbed Character 953). This sort of sentence compromises the entire book.    Basically, it reads like a reference work. It's not a \\"novel\\" as most western readers would be accustomed to thinking of one. Even if you're open to forms of literature that are drastically different from anything else you've read (as I was, going into this), you'll probably find yourself too exasperated by the novel to finish. It was really a painful experience for me.    However, all is not lost for the person seeking an entry into Chinese literature.    I recommend Dream of the Red Chamber as a good starting novel, especially the translation published by Penguin under the title \\"The Story of the Stone\\" (don't be discouraged by the alternative title, it's the same novel as Dream of the Red Chamber).    Furthermore, Red Chamber was written in the late Qing, which makes it more relevant to the modern history and identity of the region we know as China.    Those looking for older quality pieces of writing from East Asia as a whole may enjoy The Tale of Genji and The Tale of the Heike more than they would enjoy Three Kingdoms. Both \\"Genji\\" and \\"Heike\\" are lengthy novels of Japanese origin, with Genji often being considered the world's first written novel, and certainly the first in East Asia.    To all, Good luck in your readings.
B0001AVZA8|4.0|Excellent condition, Great movie too.  A brand new DVD for the price of a used.  Can't beat it.
B00005JPO1|3.0|The first part of the movie was better than the second part.  It was entertaining and provided continuity with the first three movies.  If you are an Indiana Jones fan you will probably like it.
0345479092|3.0|We purchased this book when our twin daughters were 5 weeks old.  My husband read the book cover to cover, while I focused on the portions dealing with sleeping through the night. It was the most I could due in my semi-comatose sleep deprived state.  I found the book useful in providing comfort for my anxiousness while giving us great tools to consider implementing in the care of our twins. I don't believe any book is the end-all-be-all so I reviewed the suggestions and tried them and stuck with what worked. I found her insight to be practical and in line with my own philosophy. It was very useful as we prepared to train our babies to sleep through the night.  It's good easy reading and provides loads of troubleshooting advice, but like any other advice use what works for you.
B000OVLBFS|5.0|I lucked into this movie and immediately began a search for any others in this series. I've since purchased all that are available and have not been disappointed on any aspect of each movie. Tom Selleck is excellent as the aging small town Police Chief complete with the quick wit we remember from him in his Magnum series. The plot was thorough, suspenseful and well written; each actor was cast perfectly for his/her role and the entire production well above todays standards. I found it suitable to view with my grown children and grandchildren, in mixed company, etc - no gratuitous obsenity, violence, sex, etc. A welcome relief from the mostly trash that the movie industry is projecting on us today. Simpley a good, well acted, well written 2 hours of entertainment showing much of the beautiful New England setting and one that I will watch again many times.
B001EYGOEM|5.0|Truly an excellent album.  Taylor Swift is such a gifted songwriter for someone so young that it's scary.
0790731452|5.0|As far as I am concerned, this is one of the best sci-fi movies of all time! The Martians surround Earth with flying saucers, and begin to \\"cleanse\\" the planet of it's villans. They have \\"Come In Peace\\", or at least that's what they say. After a brief encounter with the Earthlings, (and by the way, Martians don't like birds), they start disintegrating the military, Earth's leaders and anyone else that get's in their way. One of my favorite scenes is when the Martian ambasador addresses Congress and, without any hesitation, disolves the legislative branch. You can barely hold back the tears of joy, and shout \\"way to go\\"! The whole thing comes to an end when a few \\"common folks\\" finally defeat the invaders and send them back into space, but not before Washington DC, Las Vegas, and most of the free world is in a shambles. I'd give it 10 stars if I could.A must see flick!!
B0019T9FL6|1.0|AFTER THE LONG WAIT FOR THIS CD, IT IS A HUGE LET DOWN. JENNIFER IS A BETTER SINGER THEN THESE SONGS. ONLY ONES WORTHWHILE ARE SPOTLIGHT, AND I AM TELLING YOU AND THE GOSPEL SONG. OTHER THEN THAT IT'S WORTHLESS AND A WASTE OF HER VOICE.
B000WGWQG8|5.0|I never realized what an important figure John Adams was in the birth of our country until I viewed this DVD.

Highly recommended.  Prepare to be enlightened.
B001ED7C58|2.0|I don't own this CD, but I listened to the samples.  I was expecting a soundtrack like the soundtrack to \\"Romeo and Juliet\\" with Leonardo Di Caprio in it.  That is the music I would picture with Twilight.
B000ZLFALI|1.0|The common link I find to all of the negative reviews of this horrible film is that the people who hate the film are huge Beatles fans.  Also, all of us went to see this movie WANTING to love it.  And like many of the other reviewers, I left the movie thirty minutes into the film.  As soon as that dude began singing into the camera, I knew someone had brewed up and concocted a disaster.  THE MOVIE HAS NO PLOT.  All the filmmaker did was tape together one song after another, hoping that a plot would emerge somehow from the order in which they were connected.  Also, the renderings of the songs are toothless.  What horrifies me most, however, is the large number of rabid fans who are turning this movie into their cult classic, claiming to revere this band called the Beatles they'd previously never encountered.  Having all of these idiots running around \\"loving\\" the Beatles based on this film is an embarrassment to Beatles fans and the Beatles.  I am not religious, but I now finally understand why Christians are prone to such anger over other \\"Christian\\" groups who espouse beliefs that have no relation to Jesus' teachings.  Horrible.  Horrible.  Horrible.  Horrible movie.
B000K7UBTI|2.0|After having seen the live action version of Iron Man, I figured I would check out this animated feature released in 2007.  I wasn't aware upon renting THE INVINCIBLE IRON MAN that this film was going to be a revised telling of Iron Man's origins and those of his arch nemesis, The Mandarin.  The action of the film is set in modern day China.  Billionaire Tony Stark is raising an ancient Chinese city from below ground, against the advice of the board of directors of his company, Stark Industries.  In doing so, he inadvertently awakens some evil ancient magic that starts to cause chaos.  Tony's best friend and leader of the excavation, James \\"Rhodey\\" Rhodes, is kidnapped and disappears.  Tony travels to China in search of his friend and to oversee the end of the excavation.  However, the armored unit that Tony is a part of is attacked and Tony is taken prisoner by the Jade Dragons, the same people who kidnapped Rhodey.  In the attack Tony is mortally wounded.  He is saved by the magical powers of a Chinese wise man and the medical quick-thinking of Rhodey.  The Jade Dragons want Tony to build a weapon to destroy the Chinese city.  Instead, he crafts a suit of iron armor that he uses to help himself and Rhodey escape.  When Tony and Rhodey return to the U.S. agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. attempt to \\"arrest\\" the duo.  They escape and they plan on how to get into Stark Industry headquarters to get the equipment they need to bring down the ancient Elementals awakened from the excavation site who are now causing havoc across the four corners of the globe.<br /><br />I was disappointed by THE INVINCIBLE IRON MAN.  As I mentioned at the beginning, I was not aware that this was a updating and revision of the Iron Man origins story.  I don't have a huge problem with updating the story.  As times change it sometimes makes sense to update a character's origins, ala the recent IRON MAN live-action movie.  Therefore, I didn't have a problem with moving the main setting of the Iron Man's origins from Vietnam to China.  Also, the action sequences were okay, especially the battle between Iron Man and the elementals below the ocean and inside the volcano. It was all the other little things that the filmmakers did to the story.  For instance, having Rhodey with Tony and being one of the people responsible for saving his life; the iron suit Tony makes while a prisoner is not his first and is really just a improved version of many he has already created; Howard Stark did not die in a car accident and is still alive and well and is chairman of the board of Stark Industries; the rather lame \\"appearance\\" of The Mandarin; etc.  Overall, the animation is a typical action-animated piece with nothing that really stood out in terms of style, tone, or appearance.  There's also an incredible amount of time spent with the person of Tony Stark, yet there is very little development of his character at all.  I don't have a problem with Tony being the focus of the feature, but if that's going to be the case there should be some real character growth and there's just not.<br /><br />Viewers are better off watching the live-action version of IRON MAN instead of sitting through this dissatisfying mess.<br /><br />The DVD includes several extras including an alternate opening sequence, the origin of Iron Man featurette (which is a making of piece), the Hall of Iron Man Armor, sequence of concept art, the first scene from a Dr. Strange animated movie from the same company who made THE INVINCIBLE IRON MAN, and several trailers for other films.  The Hall of Iron Man Armor is very interesting.  It has pictures with detailed information about almost every different Iron Man suit that Tony Stark has worn over the years.

B001ER4CTI|3.0|\\"300 - The Limited Collector's Edition\\" is a deluxe repackaging of the feature film with mountains of bonus extras.  The plot focuses on the Battle of Thermopylae, when armies of the Persian Empire were hot to conquer Sparta.  The macho Spartans have been indoctrinated since birth to never surrender, never retreat.  King Leonidas (Gerard Butler) leads 300 of his bravest men to lure the Persians into a narrow gorge where the enemy's huge numbers will be of no advantage.  However, traitors are working to undermine Sparta's attempt to maintain its independence.   Based on the graphic novel by Frank Miller (\\"Sin City\\"), \\"300\\" is a bloody movie filled with over-the-top, intense images and a stylized manner of acting in which performers are given to shout and bluster, delivering every line as if it were vitally significant.  This tends to get tired pretty quickly.  But the movie is fun, if only for the wild visuals combining live action and CGI animation and the film's muted color palette.  In its clear demarcation between good and evil, \\"300\\" is hardly subtle and in many ways is a throwback to films of the 1950's when the audience knew from the get-go that the star was the one to root for.  This is simple story-telling embellished with breathtaking visuals, the true attraction of the movie.   The Limited Collector's Edition contains the previously released two-disc Special Edition along with the new documentary, \\"To the Hot Gates: A Legend Retold,\\" a look at the process the filmmakers followed to take a graphic novel's treatment of an ancient legend and realize it as a feature film.  There are also a digital copy of the movie, a 52-page hardcover art book, a lucite display with motion film image, and six photo cards.
0307455874|1.0|This book was full of lies. The only hope of change he will bring to this country is to bring it to fall. God better step in and help this country because we are doomed to a life of hell.

B000WO251Q|5.0|This book was a definite tear jerker.  I read the entire novel in less than a weekend; it was very difficult to put it down.  It is about a military boy who was always in trouble as a kid, who falls in love with a beautiful Christian girl who inspires and intrigues him.  She is in town for the summer buiding houses with her church when he came across her on the beach, saving her purse after it had fallen in the ocean.  The book maps the story of their love and his homelife with a father who is incapable of social interaction.  John goes back to the military after meeting his new love interest, with intentions of marrying her after his contract ended.  Little did they know, the tradgedies of September 11th would soon hit and he would sign-up again for another military term, which inevitably seals their fate.  You definitely need a box of Kleenex to read this book, but it's one of Sparks' best for sure!

B000MRAAJM|5.0|When Planet Earth came out, it was a great nature documentary. But the presentation on Blu-Ray raises it to a whole other level. This is a tour of various habitats and climates on the earth. The photography is simply unmatched and in HD the detail in the shots is amazing. It would seem like alot to watch, but it goes fast. There are Blu-Ray movies were the format adds nothing and then there are things like this were the format shows what can be done.    The photography is unmatched. The educational value is high and the narriation is just right. This series will convince any skeptics out there of the value of the Blu-Ray HD format.    And I would suggest again that the BBC should put out Blue Planet: Seas of Life on Blu-Ray as well. Its long overdue.
B00013F35I|5.0|update 20090702   I forgot to mention that when compared to the original studio tracks, these live versions are in many (if not all) cases simply better: fuller, brighter, more engaged, whatever. Particularly those from The Rising. Hands-down Barcelona is better than the original.    ***    I'm no sage of DVDs and don't care much for video with my music. Nonetheless, this recording, borrowed from my local library, is simply fabulous. Quality reigns through in both sound and videography. Unlike a Queen DVD cheaply recorded at Wembley which I didn't even bother watching to the end, this Springsteen effort is a class act from start to finish and you can tell the production went to great expense to do a proper job of capturing the evening and reproducing it for a living room. There must have been about 6 or more cameras in play, some stationary, some moving, one flying. The emotion and excitement from both the band and the audience is palpable. The audience noise does not interfere with the music.    These people knew what they were doing. It's a great time.
B001C08RHA|4.0|Ironman is right up there with the other heroes. Yet he seems closer to being human than the others. Maybe it's his clumsiness? Whatever the case Robert Downey Jr. did a great job. Now for the movie....yes its funny and something for the entire family but could use a little more depth. Afterall Spidey and Batman have some serious issues brewing (criterion/prerequisite for being a superhero). Perhaps we could see that in Ironman 2? Sometimes you have to run before you can walk...what a riot.
B000IFQLLY|5.0|As a fan of Depeche Mode since 1986, a new release is always cause for celebrtion. It used to mean a couple 12 inch singles would also be released with extended versions and maybe a b-side. then came cassette maxi singles and remixes. Followed by cd singles and imports, videos and downloads. The albums are all wonderful, and the singles have all spawned their own mini-albums...remember how many versions of Personal Jesus we got?!!? My point is that Depeche Mode does release GREAT singles. Awesome songs, and this compilation s great for someone wanting an overview. But as good as the singles are, there are many 'album tracks' that are the true gems...This is just the surface. Many singles are missing, including my 2 favorites \\"Stripped\\" from Black Celebration, and 'Behind The Wheel\\" from Music For The Masses. The exclusion of those tracks alone should send one running up to the nearest record store. If you like this stuff, there is much much more where it came from. Go get their albums and treat yourself to a couple of the cd remix singles. Indulge in the world of Depeche Mode. You won't be sorry. Can't wait for the new album in 2009!
B0010X745K|5.0|I am always devided when it comes to book to movie adaptions as alot of times they ravage the story.  But overall I was plesantly surpized with this latest Stephan King story brought to celluoid.  The effects are done well considering, the plot is very suspenciful (fear of the unknown), and the premise of how the mist/whats in the mist came to be is not explained but briefly suggested at and very interesting. I love movies that leave you thinking and captivated ie: 28 Days/Weeks Later and the Mist is no exception. Over all a great movie, this one will leave you captivated and looking over your shoulder and staying away from dark corners for days to come.  Great Job!
B00005JPO1|3.0|I love the Indiana Jones series, and when I was a teen I memorized the dialogue by watching Raiders over 100 times.  Like many fans, I've been practically drooling over the possibility of Indiana Jones 4 for years.  Alas, this was not really worth waiting for.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong, it's great to see Ford wearing the fedora again, and Karen Allen can still light up the screen.  Even Shia does a good job.  The acting is fine.  The problem is the script.  If only we could have seen Frank Darabont's screenplay instead of Crystal Skull!  The plot just groans along, with some of Spielberg's worst directing since his \\"Kick the Can\\" segment of the Twilight Zone movie.<br /><br />Somehow the Indiana Jones franchise has done the opposite of the Star Trek films: here the odd numbered films are the good ones.  Raiders and Last Crusade are fantastic films from beginning to end.  Temple of Doom and Crystal Skull?  Not so much.  Maybe searching for a biblical artifacts works better than new age/alien pablum.  I really hope they get together for Indiana Jones 5 (there are lots of good biblical artifacts left), and let the series go out on a high note.
B001BR5F4C|5.0|If you are a fan of Quentin Tarantino this is a must own.  I waited to purchase these films until the much anticipated Whole Bloody Affair was to come out.  I realized that I might be waiting for something that will never arrive.  Plus, Disney has always handled the Blu-Ray conversion extremely well, and this is absolutely no exception.  The color is bright and sharp and the sound is fantastic.  If you truly are waiting for the Whole Bloody Affair, good for you.  If you are thinking you can't wait, this will hold you over nicely.
0792163710|5.0|I saw this movie for the first time more than a year ago. I've forgotten the storyline, the incidents, the details. But the sheer EXPERIENCE of watching the movie lingers in my heart. There are westerns that are grander (John Ford), more stylish (Sergio Leone), more sophisticated (Anthony Mann); but to me Shane is the most beautiful, the most affecting, the most luminous. It is among the most beautiful movies ever made. The longer time passes without me re-watching it, the greater it looms in my consciousness. I guess that's the mark of a true work of art; it takes root in some part of your soul, and grows over time. I hope the studio releases a better DVD transfer (and maybe even a fully restored blu-ray version) than the one we have here, whose image quality is less than optimal.
0070511136|5.0|As a sales and marketing trainer and coach for professionals, I discovered Neil Rackham's book while looking for a simple way of explaining the techniques that distinguish larger, more complicated sales from small quick sales.<br /><br />This book provided exactly what I was looking for.  SPIN is an easy way to remember to ask more questions--and more meaningful questions--and the discussion of how to raise the level of need from \\"implicit\\" to \\"explicit\\" and then sell to the \\"explicit\\" need was a brilliant way of explaining what the best professionals I've worked with have learned to do.<br /><br />In my own book,[...], I used a simple 10-step template like this to help people overcome the fears that keep them from doing what they need to do to be successful.<br /><br />Rackham supports his template with hard research, but anyone who watches top professionals sell their services can instantly recognize the accuracy of what he presents.
B0001I562I|4.0|Flight of the Navigator is a story that would bring thrills to any young person who is interested in outer space, strange 'creatures' from other planets and trying their hand at actually flying a craft like the one in this movie. The time travel answers some questions about how 'stepping into the future' would affect you and your current family life. The story is entertaining for the entire family.

All I wanted to do is see what if any difference there is in this newly jacketed item; it was news to me they retired the other.  Not a mention.  Please add usefull, factual or unknown tips like Keith Richards was kidnapped by Ray Davies and Jimmy Hendrix is in the background.  Now that's useful.  Otherwise shut up!

B000FSME1A|5.0|This is a very creative box cover and with the included two discs you get Apocalypse Now which looks great on the DVD, you also get Apocalypse Now Redux a 2001 version of the movie with Remastered video quality and over one hour of additional scenes added into the movie itself that were cut from the original, and many other features including interviews and watching the movie with commentaries from director as the movie plays. All in all i'd say this is a perfect product. However it must be noted that since the movie is very lengthy especially the Redux version, the movie is split with the first half on disc 1 then the second half switching to disc 2. Not a real annoyance or problem its just something  you should know.

0375842209|5.0|Although I originally purchased this book to challenge some of my middle school students, it took me three months to get a copy into my classroom.  After I read it twice, I passed it to a friend. It was taking too long to make the circuit, so I bought another to take to class, but offered it to a fellow teacher on the way in to the building.  You can see where this is going, right? After purchasing three copies, I finally landed one in the classroom- for one class period.  Then it was gone, making the circuit of the kids.  As far as I have been able to determine, the 26 or 27 people I've loaned it to have all read it completely, most have read it completely twice, and all have found it well worth their time.  The audience has ranged from 13 year old football stars to retirees, with clergy, and a few teachers, and a lawyer in between.  This is for anyone who reads books, deeply or superficially.  Get one, or, better yet, two.
0689861141|5.0|highly recommended book by Sandra Boynton.  My child liked it so much I bought more of her books... but he did not like her others.<br /><br />I read this book to him almost every night.<br /><br />Revised 2014: He can possibly still be able to recite pages just by looking at the pictures.  It still on his bookshelf.  This is one book i have been asked to never never donate. He said he wants to save it for his child.<br /><br /> Parenting tip:  start reading to them before they can even comprehend and they will grow up loving to read.

B001ECQ6YW|3.0|The three-year old loves this movie and, quite honestly, that is the only reason to own it. Of course, if you're a parent who would appreciate not exposing your little one to excessive violence, then you still might want to give this one a pass.<br /><br />I really expected more from it considering it boasted the talents of Hoffman, Jolie, and McShane. Mostly the adults in the room were totally bored and ready for it to be over. Kadden, the three-year old, had a ball with it.<br /><br />If you must see it, borrow or rent.
0765316897|4.0|I've thoroughly enjoyed this series!! This was a good book, and parts were completely engrossing, but I felt it was slower at times than the first two books were. The same thing might have been accomplished with 75 less pages in the middle. Also, the action kept switching back and forth between Urteau and Fadrex City, and each time it switched I was annoyed because I wanted to know what was going to happen next in the city I had just been reading about (that might be why it was easy to put this one down and pick it back up again - it felt like you were \\"picking it back up again\\" every chapter or so anyway). However, the complexities and twists in this beast are many and varied and awesome, and *I* certainly wouldn't have wanted the task of editing it down. There were a couple of moments that were downright CREEPY - I got chills reading it late at night in a dark house, which I hadn't experienced during the first two books. And WOW!!!! WHAT AN ENDING!!! I cried at the end (around 2am last night, thank you very much Mr. Sanderson) from sheer emotion. Best ending I've read in a long time. A little far fetched, maybe... it felt a little less \\"real\\" by the very end... but still wonderful. One of the most enjoyable things to me was trying to figure out who in the world was writing the italics at the beginning of each chapter. He drops some really delicious clues in those little blurbs, much like in the first two books.    I was amused throughout this series by Sanderson's occasional, subtle commentary on Christianity (ie Vin musing, \\"Why would a religion choose the object that killed their God as a symbol to represent them?\\"), and until the end of this book, I was having a very hard time deciding whether the series was going to give a pro-religion moral, or an anti-religion moral. It was made very clear by the end of this book. Sanderson's depth of insight into many aspects of life is really refreshing... if only he were still single... =P    Occasional slow pacing mightput off some readers, and the sheer complexity of the magic system might put off some readers (seriously, it just keeps getting more and more complicated), but I think the rewards at the end are well worth it for anyone who enjoyed the first two books.
B0010VD7EO|5.0|MGMT are a New York duo whose Pop/Dance/Rock/Electronic sound makes for a heady mix. Their very playful disc \\"Oracular spectacular\\" comprises just 10 tracks (these days, loads of CDs average 11 tracks, doing away with filler).<br /><br />\\"Let's make some music, make some money, find some models for wives\\" they sing in the buzzing \\"Time to pretend\\" as they spell out the hedonistic lifestyle they have mapped out.<br /><br />The acoustic \\"Weekend wars\\" reminds me a wee bit of The Beatles. \\"Of monsters, birds & monsters\\" is more upbeat. An extremely catchy retro sounding Pop/Rocker. The echo-ey \\"The youth\\" is so retro sounding, almost a Doo-wop ballad with shimmery psychedelic effects. \\"Electric feel\\" is disco-tinged and finds the duo singing in falsetto. Extremely catchy and one of my favourites.<br /><br />\\"Kids\\" (aptly filled with sounds of kids at play) is a stomping slice of Dance/Rock, while the droning \\"4th dimensional traditional\\" features some tribal sounding percussion. \\"Pieces of what\\" is a lovely acoustic ballad (with percussion and epic strings coming in before the end). \\"The handshake\\" is a lovely ballad with echo-ey/disembodied vocals, while closing is the woozy psychedelic-sounding \\"Future reflections\\".<br /><br />A spectacular debut!

B001DHXT20|4.0|Ang Lee's \\"Hulk\\" was, to say the least, misguided, dull, overly cerebral, and disappointing.  This one (which basically ignores the original film) is MUCH more faithful to the comic book and the classic television series.  Yes, the dialogue is a bit stilted, but this is a comic book movie, what did you expect? The story moves along quickly, there is an underlying sadness to Bruce Banner's dilemma, the special effects are well done, the final battle is satisfying...overall, a solid effort and I do hope they eventually do a sequel (I know they are doing \\"The Avengers\\" next, but a Hulk sequel would be appreciated as well).  I only gave it 4 stars because this movie is NOT the revelation that \\"Iron Man\\" was...this is more of your standard superhero movie, but again, reasonably well done.

B00012FXAE|4.0|This film was a staple of my youth. I was an usher in a movie theater when it was released in the '80s. The reactions I kept hearing from the crowd were amazing and now twentysomething years later it still is one of the best Sci-Fi films ever made. The DVD looks great and the sound is incredible but the special features disc is the treasure. The feature length \\"making of\\" documentary was very entertaining and informative from, casting, to set construction, to special effects and creature design it had it all. That's the kind of features I like to see not the ones where they all talk about how great working with each other was. But, to delve into character development and script writing what it took to bring James Cameron's vision to the screen, that's the good stuff. Forget all the other special editions this is the one to have.

B000MV9026|1.0|That's what I told myself as the film unfolded in all its lameness:<br />- the adult penguins are incredibly ugly (and not in a cute way), I figured the movie would quickly move away from them, but no, they kept showing up<br />- the hordes of black and white penguins in an arctic environment, way too much white, and the huge numbers were offputting, I was counting on the action to move somewhere else, a tropical island, etc. (I don't care about realism in kid films, I want entertainment). But no, WAY too much of the movie was just penguins on ice, and huge crowds of ugly penguins<br />- even the main character Mumble, he was halfway cute as a kid but then he quickly grows up into this rather uninteresting, not very cute penguin<br />- the music was mostly cheeseball<br />- the plot was scattered, trying to be a modern version of Dumbo but failing, some of the chase scenes were way too scary for small kids<br /><br />This is the worst kids DVD I've ever bought. My mistake, don't let it be yours!

B00188M5TM|4.0|If \\"Changeling\\" didn't tell us right up front that it was based on a true story, one might be easily forgiven for dismissing it as nothing more than far-fetched and implausible melodrama.  But since truth so often IS stranger than fiction, we can but sit back in openmouthed disbelief as this most bizarre of bizarre scenarios unfolds before us.<br /><br />Angelina Jolie plays Christine Collins, a single mother living with her nine-year-old son, Walter, in 1928 Los Angeles.  When Walter goes missing one day, the frantic mother pleads with the police to find him.  After five long months of grueling suspense, Christine is finally reunited with her child.  Or is she?  For while the police, eager to close the case for publicity purposes, insist that the boy they've found is indeed her missing son, Christine knows otherwise and spends the next few months attempting to convince anyone who'll listen that her real son is still out there somewhere and that the boy living with her is an imposter.  John Malkovich co-stars as a crusading radio preacher who takes up the cause of this understandably distraught mother against the increasingly disreputable and malicious LAPD.<br /><br />Written by J. Michael Straczynski and directed by Clint Eastwood (who also wrote the musical score), \\"Changeling\\" is a gripping human drama that keeps us on tenterhooks every step of its narrative-shifting way.  Going well beyond the surface fascinations of the plot, the movie broadens out to become a compelling study of police corruption and of one woman's battle for justice against a totalitarian, bureaucratic system.  Throughout, the audience is buffeted back and forth between utter frustration and heartwarming uplift and just about every other emotion in between.  It's true that the movie does have a few too many false climaxes towards the end and there are individual  moments when it veers dangerously close to exploitation, but, for the most part, this is a first-rate, riveting drama, solidly directed by Eastwood and beautifully acted by Jolie, Malkovich, Michael Kelly, Jeffrey Donovan, Amy Ryan and many others.<br /><br />Director Eastwood triumphs again.d and beautifully acted by Jolie, Malkovich, Michael Kelly, Jeffrey Donovan, Amy Ryan and many others.

0375826726|4.0|This is the third book in the Eragon series, following Eragon (#1) and Eldest (#2). This is a worthy installment, though not as good as the first two. My son, a reluctant reader, loves it as well.
B001FBSMW6|3.0|To keep this short, I am a huge Keane fan.  A lot of their fan base is drawn to their sound for their RadioHead, Coldplay, Beatles \\"Wall of Sound\\" effect they pull into their music.  Their arrangements are complex and beautiful, simple but really potent.  I'd suspect a lot of classical music fans also like Keane for these reasons.  That said, this fan base would probably lot listen to a lot of Flock of Seagulls or Wham! records.    This album, unfortunately, is more along those lines than what I described from Keane's first two records.    Hey, I'm all for artists trying new sounds, but this one just didn't resonate with me.  I found the lyrics to be pretty ridiculous, the melodies to be not very well thought-out, and most of the tracks to be pretty much unmemorable.    I'm confident their next effort will be better.
B001H5X7KC|5.0|This movie was without a doubt the funniest movie of the year.  I almost went to see it twice in the theater because I was having a tough time waiting for it to come out on video.      This is the kind of comedy you can watch twenty times and still laugh.
B000U7SN8O|5.0|The lyrics are poignant, the meaning behind them uplifting, the instrumentation frantic and the vocals strained and real.  Some people seem to get caught up on the lead singer's voice; so he's not Paul McCartney, but I don't have a problem with it.  CSNY didn't want to let Neil Young sing at first either, but he's had one of the longest and most successful musical careers in memory.  A simply beautiful album if you have the capacity to listen to it (yes, musical snobbery.  Egads!)
B000000OU6|4.0|Slash's Snakepit-It's Five O'Clock Somewhere ***1/2<br /><br />For what it is and the audience it was aimed after It's Five O'Clock Somewhere is a nice bluesy rock n' roll album. What started out as a Slash side project turned into his full time band as he left Guns N' Roses during the recording on the album. It is almost the exact same band as GNR characteristically though it sounds nothing alike, and that is a great thing. But the problem lies in that the attitude is there but the song is not.<br /><br />Almost every track on the album has what it takes but never fully delivers. The vocals become annoying at times and the lyrics are often a rock n' roll parody. If your a true blue rock n' roller you don't have to preach about it. At the end of the day Matt Sorum is not suited for this style of rock n' roll and sounds out of his element here. Perhaps that is why he wasn't on the next (superior) album, [[ASIN:B000050AML Ain't Life Grand]]. Slash himself just sounds like he is going through a guitar workout on the album. Many of the riffs are recycled and the solos seem unfinished and unfocused, this could be because the entire line-up was on smack the whole time.<br /><br />As a whole this is a less than stellar rock n' roll albums from one of the greatest guitar players ever. Slash's Snakepit would go on to make a much stronger second album, and Slash would go on to make better music as a whole. This is the low point of the artists career but worth checking out for diehards.

0307269752|5.0|I am a voracious reader -- recently of police procedurals from other countries.  I don't really have anything to add to the reviews that have already been posted.  I just have my personal experience:  I received this book on Thursday evening and started it at around 7pm.  And I read it RIGHT THROUGH.  Finished it at just after 2am.  And was late for work on Friday, because I didn't really get enough sleep.  It was THAT good.
0385340990|5.0|What a wonderful treat!  To read a book about such a serious subject (post World War II London and Guernsey) and finish the book with a big smile on my face.  The authors pulled off quite a feat - educating readers about the Nazi Occupation in the Channel Islands with all of its horrors, yet creating such a delightful group of characters who make the reader want to jump on the next plane to Guernsey, knowing he or she would be greeted with a big hug and welcomed into their literary society and their lives.  It is just so refreshing to read  a feel good book when it is becoming harder and harder to find one amidst all of the dark and depressing bestsellers recommended by so many reviewers.  (not that many of them aren't worthwhile- I'd just like more of a balance!)  Don't miss this one- a quick read, but oh SO satisfying.
B001FBJUKE|5.0|The previous review for this should be stricken from the record, it does not refer to this specific edition of this punk masterpiece.  This is the heavy duty 2008 vinyl edition and it has never sounded better, although it never really sounded all that bad in any of its previous incarnations.  Having said that, if you're in the market for an upgrade, you can do no better than some fresh 180 gram vinyl.
0385338732|4.0|I've read most of the Shopaholic books, so I was naturally expecting \\"Remember Me?\\" to be a funny book. Surprisingly, it isn't. I don't think I laughed at all. The story is kind of flat. Even though the premise of the book is intriguing--the main character has a car accident and loses all memory of the last three years--not a whole lot happens. Also, the characters are hard to relate to. I love Becky Bloomwood of the Shopaholic series because she's quirky and naive. Lexi Smart, the title character in \\"Remember Me?,\\" is not nearly as well drawn as Becky. I couldn't really relate to her, or to any of the characters. While her gorgeous, millionaire husband turns out to be not-so-perfect, I couldn't see what drew her to Jon. He's a nice guy, I presume, but he comes across as flat, like everyone else in this book.    But despite these misgivings, I'm giving this book 4 Stars because I think Sophie Kinsella is a very talented writer. I also give her a lot of credit for not wrapping up all the loose ends and for not turning this into a happily-ever-after fairy tale.
B001H5X7JS|5.0|Here's the plot: the story of a bunch of actors, lost in the jungle and beseiged by drug-runners led by a twelve-year-old boy, who are filming the story of a bunch of soldiers lost in the woods and beseiged by Viet Cong.  The film stars Ben Stiller, Jack Black, Robert Downey Jr., Jay Baruchel, Brandon T. Jackson, Danny McBride, and Nick Nolte.  It features supporting roles by Matthew McConaughey, Tom Cruise, Steve Coogan, Bill Hader, and cameos by others.  It was written by Stiller, Justin Theroux, and Etan Cohen, and was directed by Stiller.<br /><br />We got that out of the way?  Good.  Because here's the deal: \\"Tropic Thunder\\" is funny.  And smart.  How often do these go together, nowadays?  They used to, back when Mel Brooks was running the show, and it's popped up again here and there, with \\"Knocked Up,\\" \\"40 Year Old Virgin,\\" and \\"Forgetting Sarah Marshall.\\"  But \\"Tropic Thunder\\" has something all those movies don't: A point.  The message isn't just about Hollywood, either; it's something about all of us, who pretend to be what we aren't.  It's human nature to make believe; it's human nature to give into those beliefs and think they're real.<br /><br />Okay.  Enough philosophy.  I'm putting my soap box away.  \\"Tropic Thunder\\" is absolutely gut-bustingly hilarious.  It's also highly offensive, crude, and over-the-top; there are jokes that go to far, there are jokes that don't go far enough.  Such is the nature of comedy.  My point is, even the few jokes that fall flat serve to make the rest of the movie all the better.  And it doesn't hurt that the film evokes the best from its three headliners: Stiller has never been funnier (I'm not a huge fan of his, but I have to say, the man approaches, in this film, something akin to comedic genius); Jack Black, likewise, is in top form (again, I'm not a big fan; but here, he's absolutely terrific); and Downey is, simply a wonder to behold.  With all due respect to the rest of the cast and crew: This film would not be what it is without Downey's presence.  It's not that he's portraying \\"a dude disguised as a dude pretending to be another dude\\" (in this case, a white Australian actor playing an African American); it's that he portrays it so eloquently.  You never doubt his authenticity, a method actor so lost in his role that he doesn't drop character until after he does the DVD commentary.

0807014273|5.0|Man's Search for Meaning is considered among the most influential works of psychiatric literature since Freud.It begins with a moving personal essay about Frankl's imprisonment in Auschwitz and other concentration camps for five years, and his struggle during this time to find reasons to live. The second part of the book describes the psychotherapeutic method that Frankl pioneered as a result of his experiences in the concentration camps and the resulting belief  that man's deepest desire is to search for meaning and purpose. The profound lessons for me from this book  are  key messages in my workshops and in my book and audio book, [[ASIN:1933916265 Managing Thought: How Do Your Thoughts Rule Your World?]] -- that what we think is a matter of choice, that no one else and nothing else is responsible or to blame for what we choose to think; and that thoughts of purpose and possibility are powerful thoughts that bring us peace and inspire us and connect us with our highest awareness.
B0014DZ2VO|3.0|It's hard to follow up such a hard-hitting film as \\"Casino Royale.\\"  That movie unshackled Bond films from the glimmery, gadgetry world of make-believe, and freed it upon the emotional, gritty world we live in.  Even with Daniel Craig returning, \\"Quantum of Solace\\" was bound to fail.  So, please, take the movie with a grain of salt: It's no \\"Casino Royale,\\" but at least it's no \\"Tomorrow Never Dies\\" or \\"The World Is Not Enough.\\"<br /><br />\\"Quantum\\" picks up less than an hour after \\"Casino\\" left off, with Bond speeding through Italy, the sinister Mr. White tied up in the trunk of his Astin Martin.  Long story short: Mr. White escapes, and Bond is in pursuit of environmentalist and terrorist orginzation leader (or at least a key person in the organization; we're never really informed what purpose he serves, exactly) Dominic Greene.  Also after Greene is former secret agent for some South American country Camille, seeking revenge for the death of her family.  All the while, M. has decided Bond can't be trusted, and the CIA has been pursuaded to shoot him on site.  Woe is Mr. Bond, James Bond.<br /><br />In case you couldn't tell from the cynicism: The plot here is irrelevant.  Oh, it could have been grand: Daniel Craig is a great dramatic actor, perhaps the single most talented individual to take on the role of Bond; he can convey so much emotion with a twinkle from his cold blue eyes, or a slight smirk on that perpetual scowl.  And Mathieu Amalric, as Greene, shows bursts of villainous potential.  And returning actors Giancarlo Giannini (Bond's ally, Mathias, whom Bond has tortured in the first film and, naturally, holds a grudge), Jeffrey Wright (Bond's potential CIA aly, Felix Leiter), Jesper Christensen (the afore-mentioned Mr. White), and especially Judi Dench as M., all shine.<br /><br />The problem is, they are all restrained--even, and especially, Craig and Dench.  Their scenes together are the movie's best: these are two great actors who play off each other wonderfully (as do Craig and Wright, in their sole scene together).  Dench was out-of-place in the Bond of Pierce Brosnan's world (Brosnan has since proven himself to be a great actor; I fully believe that his Bond, post-\\"Golden Eye\\" at least, was an industry-polished model, and not the fault of the actor), a big fish in a small pond.  Here, she has someone to relate to, someone who can act on her level.  Her foil in \\"Casino,\\" Eva Green's Vesper, was another example: a dominant woman in a man's world, an actress talented enough to stand side-by-side with Bond and show him who's boss.

B0002YCVXI|5.0|The layering of instruments on this CD is quite noticeable. Yo-yo ma cello gives Ennio's scores a painfully haunting sound but still beautiful. I love scores and but none has made such a moving impression on me quite as this CD did. If you enjoy this CD, you should try also Itzhak Perlman's version of The Love theme from Cinema Paradiso and Schindler's List theme (of John WIlliams).
B001F7MSFM|4.0|Guillermo del Torro is one of the most visionary directors working the scene right now; watch \\"Pan's Labyrinth\\" if you have any doubts.  Or watch \\"Hellboy II: The Golden Army.\\"  At first, it's a horrible title--kinda cheesy.  But after watching the movie, you get it: This is a fairy tale, more Grimm than Anderson, with a hero who is destined to bring about the destruction of mankind.  Sounds like a real trooper.<br /><br />In \\"Golden Army,\\" Red and his comrades must face a...well...a golden army.  Actually, they must first try and stop Prince Nuada, an elf warrior who is tired of mankind ignoring and spitting on his people.  He aims to raise the Golden Army from their ancient slumber, and set them loose upon the world.  And only a hellspawn (that would be our White Knight) can stop him.  There's just one catch: Prince Nuada is more than a match for humankind, and may even be more powerful than our beloved hero.<br /><br />\\"Golden Army\\" is a visual delight: I don't even want to term the images we see as \\"special effects;\\" they are simply more realistic, more vital, than that limited term implies.  The first \\"Hellboy\\" was an impressive little action diddy, but little more; \\"Golden Army\\" is a tour-de-force, a treat to the senses.  The effects (I guess I have to use the word, after all) are stunning.  The dialogue is quick and furious; this movie is almost as funny as it is impressive.  The acting is superb; Ron Perlman, as always, manages to charm (and, let's face it, make us just a tad bit uneasy).  His rapport with teammates Selma Blair and Doug Jones (who plays multiple roles, as he did in \\"Pan's Labyrinth\\") is genuine and engaging.  Luke Goss, as the evil Prince Nuada, is a scene-stealer, a thoroughly menacing character; Goss manages, even, to bring a bit of nuance to the Prince, making him for of a tragic figure (as fits the fairy tale backdrop).  Seth MacFarlane (yes, the \\"Family Guy\\" Seth MacFarlane) brings a bit of sly grace to the character of Johann Krauss, bringing what could have been a cliched character his own little personality.<br /><br />And, see, that's the thing about \\"Hellboy II\\": nothing here is cliched.  It could have been; but it isn't.  Because this movie is a fairy tale: one gigantic, action-packed fairy tale, albeit one where the lines between good and evil aren't quite so discernable, and our hero is destined to be our destroyer.  But that's del Torro for you: He never plays completely by the rules; he always manages to bend them to his will.  \\"Hellboy II: The Golden Army\\" is simply a stunner, and much more than a comic book movie, or even a sequel.  This is a movie to delight and entertain...but also, perhaps, to make us think about ourselves and the world around us.  It's a secondary goal, to be sure, but it's there...it's there...somewhere behind the bone-eating tooth fairies and the cat-eating trolls.ld have been a cliched character his own little personality.

B000S0GYRU|3.0|I felt two stars was harsh so I give it three, although that's being rather kind. Before I watched \\"Suspiria\\" I had read a lot of things about it-- how good it is, how scary. Well, it wasn't. At least not for me. To some people this may be a frightening and effective horror film. Loud, annoying music and the overuse of vivid colors do not make a brilliant horror movie.<br /><br />This tale of an American girl arriving at a European ballet academy and discovering its sinister secrets is interestingly and strangely executed but it may leave viewers perplexed and nonplussed. (As it did me!) The best thing in this film is the first murder. It's truly over the top and operatic. But the film overall lacks a lot in substance, scares and story. For example: Maggots? What was the point of that, plotwise? There was none. And I had to stifle giggles when I saw the bat on a string, and when I heard the headmistress snoring. Not scary. I know \\"Suspiria\\" has many admirers. But maybe they saw the movie without hearing all the grandiose hype beforehand.<br /><br />So I would suggest that it's worth renting to see this film that is on so many of the 'Greatest Horror Movies' lists. You may find yourself, like I was, wondering where the real horror was. Personally I'd rather watch a truly scary 1970's horror movie like \\"Black Christmas\\" or \\"The Texas Chainsaw Massacre\\".<br /><br />Much of this movie comes off as truly laughable, unfortunately. I don't think that was the intention.
B001F290E4|4.0|Seal,one of pop music's strongest voices, returns in soulful form singing none other than some of soul's greatest songs.  While covers albums are usually horrible or merely average, SOUL proves to be an exception to that notion.  Here, Seal performs these great songs with great nuance.  No, he never trumps the original and no his performances aren't revolutionary by any means, but overall this a solid, 4-star pleasant affair.  The production work does great on every track to update the original, which is a plus for SOUL.<br /><br />\\"A Change is Gonna Come\\" starts the album with Seal sounding particularly energized covering this Sam Cooke staple with incredible ease and facility. \\"I Can't Stand The Rain\\" is consistent with \\"A Change Is Gonna Come\\" despite not reaching the same lofty heights.  However, solid on a covers album is a big compliment.  On \\"It's A Man's World\\" Seal may never achieve the manic nature in which James Brown sang the song, but he does a superb job over the updated, fresh sounding strings that underlie his smoky vocals. The falsetto exhibited by Seal here is top-notch.<br /><br />Seal sounds particularly strong the both times he covers Al Green.  \\"Here I Am (Come and Take Me)\\" sounds phenomenal with the 70s sounding horns pushing Seal to great vocal heights.  On \\"I've Been Loving You Too Long\\", Seal does Otis Redding's signature cut great justice. Similarly, he rocks out Curtis Mayfield's ubiquitous \\"It's Alright\\" with finesse.  It is a great performance of Harold Melvin and the Bluenotes' \\"If You Don't Know Me Now\\" that really shows Seal's vocal chops.  Sure, he doesn't shout and scream like Teddy Pendergrass did when he was singing lead with the Bluenotes, but Seal adds his own flair to the song making it an incredible supplement to SOUL.<br /><br />\\"Knock On Wood\\" continues the consistency of SOUL, while the second Al Green hit \\"I'm Still In Love With You\\" would make Al proud. Seal's voice paints the canvas particularly well with Al Green songs - perhaps it is the smokiness of Seals voice. \\"Free\\" is another superb cut.  \\"Stand By Me\\" isn't bad either, though I've never heard the same authenticity of \\"Stand By Me\\" as the original when others cover it (besides Seal).  \\"People Get Ready\\" ends SOUL on an incredibly high note, showcasing that Seal can be as much soul as he is pop.<br /><br />This album doesn't really break any barriers per say, but it is certainly among the best covers albums I have heard in sometime. 4 stars in my eyes.mokiness of Seals voice. \\"Free\\" is another superb cut.  \\"Stand By Me\\" isn't bad either, though I've never heard the same authenticity of \\"Stand By Me\\" as the original when others cover it (besides Seal).  \\"People Get Ready\\" ends SOUL on an incredibly high note, showcasing that Seal can be as much soul as he is pop.

They are not green (one is even pretty) and although there is some wickedness, their bumbling behavior is a grand improvement over most Hollywood-evil portrayals of witchcraft.  This movie is fun Halloween fare without bloody, gory, massacres!  I can watch this story year-round for Bette Midler's comedic genius and certain scenes are tender enough to bring a tear to my eye every time.
B0006B29Z2|5.0|While I was in HMV back in September, I saw this on the DVD rack, and being the Maiden fanboy I am, I so HAD to buy this. I've been a Maiden fan for over 2 years, and still am, and always adding to my Maiden library. Maiden are my favorite band, so I bought this. And this definitely is worth owning for sure!! 2 discs worth of material nobody has seen until they own this DVD. You get a bunch of concerts, TV interviews, rare performances you'll never get anywhere else. What more could you expect?<br /><br />Below is a brief summary of what's included:<br /><br />-LIVE AT THE RAINBOW (30 minutes)<br />This is the band's first video they ever recorded. It was recorded and released sometime after the Debut album was released, and features at-the-time newcomer to the band Adrian Smith. Filmed at the Rainbow theatre in London, this was an introductory video to the fans, and proved they were not nervous at all to film themselves. Interesting note is that during the filming, the power was lost for some reason, and that the band had to re-film and re-perform the first half of their set. And be sure to listen closely to \\"Killers\\"- it has a COMPLETELY different set of lyrics than on the album that they wrote in the dressing room the same night!<br /><br />-BEAST OVER HAMMERSMITH (45 minutes)<br />Filmed on the \\"Beast on the Road Tour\\", the first tour with Bruce Dickinson and also the tour supporting \\"The Number of the Beast\\", this is a clip of selections from their show at the Hammersmith Theatre in London. Bruce is AMAZING here (but then again, he always is amazing), the band play tightly, and one funny note is that everyone on the stage is wearing tank-tops and sleeveless shirts except for Adrian- he's dressed up all formally!!! Anyways, amazing performance, and it's interesting to see what the tour was like with Dickinson in the band, and it's also safe to say that this is Clive Burr's last tour with the band before he left and replaced by Nicko McBrain.<br /><br />-LIVE AT DORTMUND (45 mins)<br />This was the final date of the World Piece Tour, except instead of the usual setlist, they had played a shortened 50 minute set (I'll explain why I said 45 later). This was the Dortmund Festival filmed at Westfallenhalle arena in Dortmund, Germany. They were playing with Ozzy, Judas Priest, Black Sabbath and a bunch of other bands. This is, again, a tightly performed set, and what's missing here is \\"Iron Maiden\\", where Eddie is brutally murdered! This was cut since it was deemed too graphic for TV, but a clip is shown in the documentary on Disc 2.<br /><br />-LIVE AT THE RUSKIN (45 mins)<br />This is the oldest live Maiden footage avaliable. It was filmed on the day of the release of the debut album, and contains a rare performance of Charlotte the Harlot not found anywhere else. This is a pretty interesting video, and is a good taste of what the boys were like when they were just a small-town punk band.<br /><br />-20TH CENTURY BOX (20 mins)<br />An English TV episode devoted to Maiden. Aired in 1980, and quite interesting.<br /><br />-TOP OF THE POPS (8 mins)<br />Contains 2 performances, Women in Uniform and Running Free. Actually pretty cool video, and good quality.<br /><br />-THE HISTORY OF IRON MAIDEN PART 1 (90 mins)<br />This is an informative, hilarious, and fun-filled documentary about the band told by the members themselves! Interviews with the band, plus former members Paul Di'Anno, Clive Burr, Thunderstick, and Paul Mario Day. You even have interviews with Rod Smallwood (band's manager), Ross Halfin (band's photographer), and Martin Birch (band's producer in the 80s) too! It has LOTS of interviews, some of which are quite hilarious, and is worth seeing!<br /><br />So overall, this is worth owning if you're a Maiden fan!!! This has a lot of cool footage, and is definitely candy for the Maiden fan. So if you are as big a fan as I am, definitely buy this!!ate of the World Piece Tour, except instead of the usual setlist, they had played a shortened 50 minute set (I'll explain why I said 45 later).

B00005RYL9|5.0|I finally ignored many of the reviews and got tired of waiting for whatever Blu-ray version that may one day exist and bought the DVD and to say; the music is excellent and also nothing at all wrong with the DVD quality. Sure not 1080p quality but fairly good for DVD.   So much so I can now say I proudly own all of the 6 seasons of the TV series and all of the movies. The original Highlander movie finally convinced me to finish off the collection and to have all of them.   Great to see the original again and I had forgotten so many things and it was great to see how it all began. I told recommend this edition!![[ASIN:B00005RYL9 Highlander (The Immortal Edition)]]

031606792X|5.0|I was a fan of the twilight saga from the first page so I have loved all four books.  However, this last book was wonderful.  I had never been a fan of Bella before, in fact she downright irritated me in the previous books, but in Breaking Dawn I finally got her.  I saw her for who she was and though she wasn't perfect, I understood her now.  The story called to me and I literally could not put the book down.  I even got pulled from sleep to finish the book.  That is how much I loved it!!!  There were moments in this book were I laughed out loud, and literally cried.  This story moved me and I can only hope that we get a chance to visit with the Cullen's sometime soon.
B000000HZT|4.0|In 1979, during a break between Genesis albums (while Phil Collins was trying to save his marriage), Genesis members Tony Banks and Mike Rutherford worked on their respective solo debuts. Each one produced almost an hour of music in a very individual style, reflecting his own subset of the Genesis sound, with an outside singer providing the vocals. Each album has its ups and downs; I've always preferred the more melodic, friendlier Rutherford release. And I took a very long time to get into the Banks album, which is uncommercial and rather challenging. Genesis fans are really the only audience for it, but most of those -- especially ones who enjoy WIND & WUTHERING and AND THEN THERE WERE THREE -- will likely appreciate it much more quickly than I did. It's far more \\"progressive\\" than most of Banks' later, generally more pop-oriented solo works.<br /><br />Like Genesis' THE LAMB LIES DOWN ON BROADWAY, A CURIOUS FEELING tells a definite story. One major, and very deliberate, difference is that ACF's individual songs can sort of make sense outside the context of the story. In fact, it took me a few listens to realize there *was* a story.<br /><br />ACF includes three instrumental tracks that add up to over a quarter of the running time. Unlike the instrumentals on LAMB they don't tie in strongly to the plot. Rather, they seem to be there so that Banks has some performance spotlights in the midst of all the tracks that focus on the singer. (In contrast, Rutherford's album only gives him one 3-minute instrumental spotlight.) These pieces range nicely from the meditative to the majestic.<br /><br />Banks performs everything here besides the vocals and drums; this is the one place where he can be heard, for better or worse, handling all the guitars. The guest singer, Kim Beacon, is not as bland or anonymous as he may seem to be at first listen; he does a finer job with the demanding material than he's often given credit for.<br /><br />The first vocal track, \\"Lucky Me,\\" features acoustic guitar in a way that gives it something of an Anthony Phillips feel. While it's quite a good song, it brings to the fore one of the problems with the first-person storytelling used on the album: the character has to *describe* mental limitations that, for the sake of plot coherency, he can't really *demonstrate*. In this song he talks about his own simple-mindedness in somewhat too-eloquent terms, and shows wisdom which he denies having. Still, it's hard to imagine this part of the story being told in a better way. The false clue about the character's former identity (\\"I have dreams in which...\\") is a nice touch.<br /><br />\\"Lucky Me\\" having started us out at (almost) the end of the story, \\"The Lie\\" -- with third-person narration, unlike the other vocal tracks -- takes us back to the beginning. Musically it's one of the more energetic and stirring pieces on the album (although the bridge is oddly, and annoyingly, reminiscent of Elton John's \\"Goodbye Yellow Brick Road\\"). Note the steadily mounting tension in the ending chord sequence.<br /><br />\\"After The Lie\\" shows the hero as a young man, newly finding the wisdom that he'd hoped to have. In comparison to other songs, Banks succeeds somewhat in depicting, rather than bluntly describing, the character's state of mind. (But the line about \\"scientific knowledge\\" is a MAJOR clunker that should have been revised.)<br /><br />At first listen (i.e., before catching on to the album's story) I thought Banks was using the relatively ordinary-sounding title track to espouse some kind of closed-minded cynicism. At second listen, I figured it was an extension of \\"After The Lie\\" simply meant to show how smart the character had become. Now I see it serves a crucial plot function; the character has become disillusioned in the search for wisdom that was once so important to him, thus setting himself up for the next event in the story. (Interestingly, his newfound disdain for higher knowledge is still with him in \\"Lucky Me\\"; apparently this is the only thing he manages to retain through his mental breakdown.)<br /><br />\\"You\\" starts with the acoustic guitar back at center stage, then leads up to an energetic keyboard solo finale; the overall structure anticipates \\"Living Forever\\" (from Genesis' WE CAN'T DANCE). At the very end there is a quick musical quote from \\"Forever Morning\\" -- one of only a couple such \\"concept album\\"-type tricks on the disc.<br /><br />Like \\"Moonshine\\" from Rutherford's album, the nearly 8-minute \\"Somebody Else's Dream\\" wants to be a tougher song than it is. This is another place where the first-person storytelling is a problem. The frightening breakdown of the character's mental faculties isn't demonstrated in his words; he ends up merely telling us that it's happening, rather bluntly and unconvincingly (not to mention with excessive, typically Banks-ian politeness -- what's with the \\"shall\\"s and \\"shan't\\"s?). It would be interesting to imagine what events made the character realize he was losing his mind; I don't know how easily such could be written into a song, but Banks doesn't try. Also, he could easily have written music here that was more appropriately disturbing. After all, didn't he come up with a lot of those deliciously creepy chords on THE LAMB LIES DOWN? (We won't talk about what Peter Gabriel could have done with this song's subject matter... maybe with some musical help from Steve Hackett.)<br /><br />\\"For A While\\" was the (unlikely) single. Banks' electric guitar melody here (reportedly very hard for him to pull off) is worth noting.<br /><br />And at the end we get to a part of the story that I like to try imagining more details about. What happened to the character between \\"For A While\\" and \\"Lucky Me\\"? Is the closing, lullaby-like \\"In The Dark\\" addressed to the listener as it seems to be, or has the character perhaps run into someone who knows about his old life?<br /><br />Overall, not an album for everyone. But most of those who likeit will *really* like it.

0440236738|2.0|I can't believe how many great reviews this book got.  It's not very good, and rates my second star only because I was curious enough to finish it.  The two-dimensional characters and an overly-contrived, twisted plot prove disappointing.  Several plot twists are based on the easy, convenient on \\"Guess what?  I lied\\" - now that's a cheap device, maybe nearly as bad as \\"it was all a dream.\\"      If you want a great thriller, read Michael Connelly.
0375842209|5.0|The Book Thief by Markus Zusak a beautiful, that story is interesting and will not let go of the readers attention while the writing style is great.  Everything in book, though it may not make sense in the beginning, ties together in the end. The Book Thief is about a girl who lives in Germany during the Second World War. Her mother has left her with foster parents to keep her safe because her mother could not support her.  The book's main focus is on the girl and how she learns to manage life in a lower middle class foster home. The girl has a love of books, which she cannot afford, so she feels in order to get them she has to steal them. What I found very interesting about this book was how it was narrated by a character named `Death', who remains very mysterious throughout the entire book. Leisel, the main character, never actually meets the narrator or knows anything about him.  I found the fact that the writer did not tell the reader who `Death' is spectacular because it left it to my imagination who this `Death' person is and why he is telling me this story about a girl who lives in Germany during the Second World War. Granted, no book is perfect and there are some irregularities in this book such as Leisel never actually steals any books until a good few hundred pages into the book. Also there is a bit of foreshadowing around the middle of the book, but this is never tied up at the end. That's not to say that I didn't love this book.  The book has major strength's, such as ensuring the reader never wants to read another book, because no book will come close in comparison. I hated putting this book down. Every time I put this book down, it was as if I had stopped eating something delicious. I just craved more, but I knew I needed to get my rest. For teachers who need a good World War II book for their classes, I would recommend this. This book gives the reader the war from an `at home' experience through the eyes of a teenager.  This book is great any time, ofthe year, I would HIGHLY recommend it.   P.S. I'm using a Family acc. I am actually a guy.    ~Shlomo
006117758X|3.0|A feel-good novel this is not.<br /><br />\\"Ham on Rye,\\" this reader's first encounter with the author, was a relatively quick read about a rather painful childhood of Harry Chinaski, a German-American kid with an anti-conformist bent so pronounced that Holden Caulfield would tell him to cheer up.<br /><br />Chinaski is miserable in life - with his family, his school, and his economic standing. To cope, he turns to schoolyard violence and terrible habits, giving the reader a front seat into the world of a guy who makes nothing but bad decisions but keeps living in spite of himself.<br /><br />For those interested in modern literature, this book is a great example of dark anti-heroism.

B0016Q2D5M|3.0|Cheesy to its core. Brendan Fraser mugs his way through this family-fared piece of fluff, while CGI Dinosaurs and glow in the dark birds make up the ooh and ah factor. With a running time of barely 90 minutes, there's no filler at all, but frankly, there's no depth. Fraser, with his affable charm, at least gives the film a center. His nephew (Josh Hutcherson) and their Icelandic volcano guide (Icelandic actress Anita Briem) are given little else to do except run from danger and scream often.<br /><br />Given that \\"Journey To The Center Of The Earth\\" was set up as a kids effects movie (I did not see the 3-D version, but the 3-D moments were obvious), this is pure, mildly exciting and non-frightening entertainment. Be prepared for the fact that this movie is meant to amuse 8 year old boys, and you'll be fine.
B0000DIJO2|5.0|This concert was one of the best I have seen of any performers ever.  I have watched it over and over and never get tired of it.  One hit after another including probably the best harmony in the business.  If you don't buy another DVD concert, get this one!
0446615625|3.0|Alex Ford is a Secret Service agent on White House detail with three years to go until retirement.  He's tempted to coast the rest of the way through his career, until a \\"suicide\\" that seems too cut-and-dried has him asking questions.  Oliver Stone is a protester who has a tent in the park across the street from the White house.  He and his three friends know more about the death of Patrick Johnson than just about anyone, since they witnessed his murder.  The FBI is willing to write Johnson's death off as a suicide, since it appears he shot himself, left a note, and drugs were found in his home, but Johnson's fianc&eacute;e isn't buying it.  Her suspicions have agent Ford and his rookie partner investigating and getting themselves in hot water with the Secret Service.  Alex can't let it go, though, when suddenly several terrorists suspiciously kill each other off.  He's demoted down to protection detail in Brennan, Pennsylvania, when the president makes a campaign stop in his hometown, but this puts him unwittingly in the middle of an intricate plot against the president of the United States.  Alex doesn't want to listen, but Oliver Stone and his Camel Club hold the keys to unraveling the mystery and saving the world from World War III.<br /><br />This was mostly an engaging suspense thriller with warm, comfortable characters who were ordinary people with extraordinary pasts.  The plot unfolded at a steady pace, the story moving smoothly from character to character while the suspense built.  Unfortunately, the plot took a ridiculous turn near the end (8 hours to Armageddon?) and some of the characters' actions were extremely unrealistic.  Had a bit of restraint been used rather than going over the top, the same amount of tension could have been woven into the story without getting silly.  The rest of the book, and the story itself, were engaging, if a bit anti-American in a coddle-the-poor-misunderstood-terrorists sort of way.  If one's beliefs lean that way, it's a plus, I suppose.  In all, this was a book that kept me turning the pages, and I will read Baldacci againplus, I suppose.  In all, this was a book that kept me turning the pages, and I will read Baldacci again
B00154GEFU|5.0|After a 25-year hiatus, the original Asia line-up of John Wetton (bass), Carl Palmer (drums), Geoff Downes (keyboards), and Steve Howe (guitars) has finally re-formed and their new album \\"Phoenix\\" features the same classic Asia sound that made them so popular years ago.  There have been several incarnations of Asia in past years, most recently including Geoff Downes and John Payne, but none of these psuedo-line-ups could match the musical ability of the original foursome.    This CD is loaded with songs containing the trademark Asia sound.  Carl Palmer can still bang drums with the best of them, and John Wetton still sounds good on lead vocals.  Songs like \\"Never Again\\" and \\"An Extraordinary Life\\" bring back memories of twenty-five years ago.    I've been a loyal Asia fan for many years, and I bought some of the CDs that didn't include the original line-up.  Needless to say, they weren't as good.  I kept hoping for a reunion of the original members, and \\"Phoenix\\" was definitely worth the wait.  If you're a fan of the original Asia, then make sure to listen to Phoenix.  The band still sounds as good today as they did 25 years ago.
B0013ND30M|5.0|A timeless story; still classic. The new technology enhances the imagery and truly brings out the vividness of the colors. A very nice addition to one's collection.
B00192KCQ0|1.0|This is probably the sorriest excuse for an album (second only to LOAD) that Metallica has excreted in their illustrious career. Oh, Cliff Burton must be spinning in his grave.
B000002TWN|3.0|D'Angelo's Brown Sugar CD came out back in the late 90's and it was a hit then just as many of the songs now are still hits. I am not sure what happened to D'Angelo but he had a sultry voice that made the ladies scream. This is a good CD, nice vocals and beats. If you are considering purchasing Brown Sugar, I say it's a must purchase. Of course, YMMV.....NEOSOUL06.
0446605409|5.0|Plum Island is a book you will not be able to put down. The introduction of the character John Corey is a breath of fresh air in this saturated world of \\"thriller\\" books. I instantly liked this guy and knew that if anything bad happened to him, I was going to write a letter of complaint to Mr. DeMille.<br /><br />Set in New York's Nassau County North Fork, Plum Island follows NYC Det. John Corey who is recovering from being shot by a couple of New York City thugs. While getting fat and drinking beer at his Uncle's summer home, Corey is talked into helping the local law enforcement investigate a double homicide involving scientist from the infamous Plum Island facility, an animal biological disease study center. What follows is both a surprise and absolute brilliance!<br /><br />Plum Island has just the right touch of wit, suspense, romance, and conspiracy to keep readers turning the pages. I finished the book in record time (2 days) and immediately went out to find the next John Corey book. DeMille will have a hard time topping Plum Island, but I look forward to seeing him try.

B00127RAJY|5.0|Wow, after doing this for the past 2 weeks, I'm so impressed with Jillian.  The first few times- and actually still sometimes!- I feel like I am not going to get all the way through.  I started with Level 1, after a few days moved on to level 2.  I stayed at level 2 for 10 days and the last few days I finally got to Level 3- woohoo!  This is a majorly intense workout- don't let the \\"20 minutes\\" fool you.  But it's such a great feeling of accomplishment when you get to Level 3.  I am already noticing results after 2 weeks- especially in my upper body.  jillian does a lot of weight training so not only will you lose weight, but you will become stronger.  I am raving to everyone about this video, and it's nice reading other people's reviews because once you get started you're hooked.  It's nice to hear from other people so I know I'm not the only one who is obsessed with this video ;)
B001DHXT20|4.0|THIS Hulk movie is a really good one.  The visuals are great, the script is very good, and it isn't difficult to follow.  Plot points naturally flow together, especially when considering the characters enacting them.  I give this DVD 4 stars because it's not the edition with all the bells and whistles, and only \\"perfect\\" things should get 5 stars (Iron Man, anybody?  lol).  Enjoy.  It's good.
B000HIVOI2|1.0|Search the Internet and you'll find out this Blu-ray version has at least two defects; missing Egyptian and alien subtitles, and right half of main menu doesn't work (you can still change audio and commentary other ways, but I can't get to the THX demo or setup.    Don't buy any Blu-ray titles produced by LionsGate.  They're not honest businessmen.
B000EBD9TY|3.0|This film explores the women's mental problem through the character named Blanch.  At the climax, Stanley raped Blanche and revealed what she had done in the past.  Finally, Blanche broke down mentally and was sent to mental hospital.  The climax of this film is when Blanch was mentally broke down, so the beginning of this film is when her mental problem was revealed to audience.  Audience will know she had some mental problem when Stanley asked her to give him paper about selling her house.  She did not respond his question, and Stanley tried to find papers by himself from her bag.  She was so upset and looked awkward when he tried to find papers.  You will probably think that she had some mental problem.        When I saw the scene that Stanly tried to find paper, I thought Blanch was strange and she may have mental problem.  At the climax when she mentally broke down, I could easily understand why she looks strange and wired at the beginning.  The actor of Blanch gives you some clue of her mental problem at the beginning and lead smoothly to climax.        This movie make you think what is wrong with Blanch at the beginning.  You never know why she was strange and what happened to her in the past.  You have to wait until the climax to know the truth.  The structure is really looks like the one of the mystery.  I read many mystery books and films, and I feel this film have same structure.  For example, in the film of Da Vinci code, you do not the truth at the beginning of the story.  You do not know who the culprit is.  You will know the truth at the end.       I recommend the movie to the people who like mystery.  You will really enjoy reasoning what is the truth by watching this film.
0689878451|5.0|This is a wonderful book about how being different is ok.  It's terrible that people want this book banned.  There is nothing crude or offensive in this story and the illustrations are great.
B000VWE5OY|3.0|You would think that a team who studied alien events would have more contact with aliens. But instead we get *SPOILER* cannibals, cybermen, and a creature that looks exactly like the devil on Doctor Who. Not very original. Season 2 is better, but not by much.  Also if you don't like to watch people have sex, talk about sex or homosexual acts, then this isn't the show for you.
B000X3VN46|5.0|I bought the version with the DVD, it was a few extra $, but well worth it.  You get to see video of 'My Winter Storm' (the song), and an interview with Tarja during / after the making of the video.  There are also a few different versions of the video; they vary in slight sublties.    The album was a great first solo effort for her.  She still keeps within the music genre that was Nightwish (orchestral,gothic,metal), but at the same time, she brings in her own creativity and inspiriations and produces songs that are very uniquely hers.  I think the lyrics to 'My Winter Storm' seem to tell a story about what happened between her and Nightwish.  I am very intersted to see what her next album will bring.    -Kip  San Diego, CA
160459201X|5.0|Joseph Murphy's book on the power of the subconscious mind is well written and studded with case studies in support of his claim that people can perform miracles if only they 'believe'. Now that's a strange word because belief is liable to change over time depending on the changes in the behavior pattern of both the subject and the object. If human beings are extremely cautious and reserved in believing his social counterpart in day to day interaction how can he put his unreserved faith on a 'substance' of things hoped for.<br /><br />It is true that subconscious mind is the seat of emotions but then again men's inner world is too complex and too vast and nobody knows how and where these reactions would land him into. There is no deterministic pattern to achieve a thing through sheer belief. Even the very author in question cannot duplicate his previous success by relying on his subconscious power. It is difficult to experience a situation that one has not previously encountered. Mere repetition of a lullaby 'wealth' is no guarantee that one would be wealthy. Likewise, the quality of leadership to run a country can't be developed through such practices and Joesph Nye's book on leadership suggests some practical measures to that effect.<br /><br />Nevertheless, this is an outstanding book in developing positive attitude so needed in a tension ridden contemporary world.<br /><br />Gautam Maitra<br />Author of 'Tracing the Eagle's Orbit: Illuminating Insights into Major US Foreign Policies Since Independence'.
B001E75QGG|3.0|Watched the movie....  WHY DID THEY HAVE TO MAKE IT ALIENS???  That was a huge disappointment right at the beginning of the movie.  And Shia's acting was mediocre in this one, like he was a tough guy Kid.  Good FX though.
B001GQACGO|4.0|On her website, Beyonce wrote that this album contains what she considers the best music she's recorded to date, and in many ways this is true.  The double CD \\"I Am...Sasha Fierce\\" manages to appeal to fans of the power ballad songstress from \\"Dangerously in Love\\" and the club queen with sick dance moves from \\"B'Day.\\"  And while improving on both those styles, Beyonce also branches out into new territory to generally good, if not great, results.    The first disc of this album (the \\"I Am...\\" part) starts off strong with the hit single \\"If I Were a Boy.\\"  The song showcases Beyonce's strong emotional interpretation of songs and her incredible voice (an asset many of her fellow pop divas lack), and quite frankly the track gets better each time I hear it.  She immediately one ups herself with the best track on the entire album, \\"Halo,\\" with soaring vocals and a much stronger melodic structure than many of today's hit ballads.  The first disc features nary a misstep, and the acoustic, singer-songwriter vibe of \\"Satellites\\" is another highlight.  By the end of the first disc, you feel like this album is destined for greatness, and probably a few Grammys.    Then the \\"Sasha Fierce\\" portion starts, and things get dicey.  \\"Single Ladies\\" is a pretty good song, although its success as a single owes as much to the excellent music video as the actual song.  But things get worse with \\"Radio\\" and the unintentionally funny \\"Diva,\\" which fail to show off Beyonce's voice or provide a good beat for her to dance to.  These ventures into urban hip-hop are off-putting as they are poorly done and even worse, feel forced.  I was a huge fan of much of \\"B'Day,\\" and I wish the Sasha Fierce songs borrowed a bit more of the tribal beats and strong dance grooves of that album.  Songs like \\"Hello\\" and especially \\"Scared of Lonely\\" help redeem the Sasha persona, but most people will probably be left wondering where their Beyonce went.    Also, while I love the concept of separating the two styles in an A Side/B Side type manner, there is not nearly enough content to warrant two discs.  You can listen to all 16 tracks in a little over an hour, leaving you feeling a tad cheated.  Combined with the generally weaker Sasha Fierce songs, this makes it hard to whole-heartedly recommend the album.  Still, Beyonce tackles a lot of new styles and does many of them well, giving her fans and newcomers a lot to like.  Maybe on her fourth album she'll finally nail it.
0385751893|4.0|The author presents a good story in a lucid well written manner. The writing style starts off a bit awkward in terms of setting the scene and character introduction, but picks up quite well after a few pages.     I agree with a previous reviewer (on .com not .ca) that the story may not be 100% historically accurate when considering what a child of that age, at that time, and in that historical period may have done, known or understood. Having said that, the purpose of this book is to tell a story, rather than attempt to recount history accurately.     With the author breaking away from similar genre books and telling the story from the German perspective, it sheds light on what life may have been like from \\"outside the fence\\" through the eyes of a young man. For those that can immerse themselves in the book, the story manages to provide young and old readers alike with some food-for-thought in terms of considering the impacts or outcomes of personal decisions and their ripple effects (from either the parents' or from Bruno's perspective).     I had two issues with the book. In some parts (very minimal), I found the writing style borderline annoying. I highlight this issue without mentioning anything specific in the book - but a parallel example could be: John wasn't looking for his socks, gloves, coat, books, bag, watch, shirt, shoes, pencils, or sun glasses. He was looking for his hat.     Second, I was bothered by the political intonation of the very last sentence in the book, which I personally felt ruined the mood set in the preceding pages. To be sure, my issue is not with the message itself, just with how it abruptly brings the reader out of a pensive and emotional state that was built up nicely over the preceding couple of pages.     Overall, however, the book is an easy to follow story, quite an enjoyable and an interesting read for young, young adult and adult readers alike. I would certainly read it again.
B00009MGQL|4.0|So I am an instrumental fan, and this album fits nicely into my collection. This has about 4 really good songs that blend nicely with everthing from Tommy Guerrero to King Black Acid. I found the tones very interesting, in classic Jeff B form, low on viruosity and high in creativity. He has come a long way from Cream, but it is also back to the instrumental vibe that he was doing back in his stevie Wonder funk phase.
B001ACH4DS|5.0|David has always been original and never swayed by mass media.  Personally I loved his American Idol music and I know he was as creative as he could be with that genre, but that was not his love,  This album is who he is, as the title of the album cover states.  There may be some who have to rethink rather than critize David for what he says/does with this music.  Honesty is what is so wonderful about it.  Never listened to Am. Idol before and probably never will again.  I will however always listen to David Cook's music.
B001F290E4|1.0|Let me start by saying, I LOVE, LOVE Seal's voice.  I am still a HUGE seal fan, but this album is a disaster.  I am not sure why he did a cover album when he is still young, and I really don't know why he teamed with David Foster.  David Foster is a very good producer, but not good for the type of music Seal makes.  The album comes across as something you might hear in a grocery store.  It is just very bland and boring.  I really liked his previous album, System.  At least it had some originality.  Sorry, but this is just not my taste.
B000EJ9MTW|2.0|A friend recommended this to me because I told them I was listening to stuff like The James Gang and Creedence lately. So I checked it out, and as soon as the first song started, I recognized them as the band whose songs have been in some really annoying commercials from the past year or so. Some of the instrument work is catchy, but those annoying Jack White Jr. tinny vocals simply will not stand. The line is drawn here.<br /><br />If albums were people, 'Wolfmother' would be the 90 lbs. weakling at the beach. 'The Pleaser' (Harvey Milk's 1997 opus) would be the strapping muscle-bound bully that comes along and kicks sand in his face and steals his girlfriend. If you really want to hear a younger generation channeling the spirits of the original 70s Rock Demigods, check out The Pleaser. Please.
B001ACH4DS|5.0|Nothing has been harder than waiting until today to buy this album!  It is soooo good!  Every song is rockin and Permanent is incredibly beautiful.  Go David!!!!!!!
B001E7OO2I|5.0|John Legend is in  a league all his own. Only the grown can appreciate his passion to release what's true to him. That is what mskes this album beautiful. He takes risks and reacheas to the top with this album. I love this album with all the collaborations he takes this album to the next plateau. Love you John Legend. I'm looking forward to seeing you live in concert.
B000AA7AZI|5.0|The sound quality is much better than the 1990 Cd pressing. Buy these now before they are discontinued.
B000093BDX|5.0|My 7 mo old can't help herself.  She just has to dance when she hears the beachboys.
B000FTWB7G|5.0|I heard this voice on a Moonlight episode and feel in love with the sound amy lee made.  I searched for the name of the group and singer, then I bought the CD.  I dont consider this gothic music, just good quality singing with excellent backround music.  I sang professionally for all my life and when I heard this CD I fell in love with this sound so I have purchased other CDs from the same group.
B00192KCQ0|5.0|I have to say I was shocked, stunned, on my first listen to this album. I had not idea that Metallica had any of their 80s sound left. I have been listening to, and a die hard follower of Metallica since 1985. After St. Anger, I did not know what to expect. After seeing the fallout of the band's recording on \\"Some Kind of Monster\\", I fully understood the raw sound of that album. Don't get me wrong, it was very heavy; and, unlike most other fans, I thoroughly enjoyed that album; but it was not the Metallica that any of us came to know and love in the 80s.<br /><br />Death Magnetic, on the other hand, sounds like it could have been recorded right after ...And Justice For All! If you listen to AJFA and then Death Magnetic it is like a continuation of a theme. Metallica is back and doing what they do best, thrash and speed metal. Definitely, if not the best album they have ever put out, this one is very close. From the intensity of songs like \\"My Apocalypse\\" and \\"That Was Just Your Life\\" to the polished ballad that is \\"The Unforgiven III\\" there is not a song on this album that I couldn't get into, they even have an instrumental (Suicide & Redemption) and we haven't had one of those out of Metallica in 20 years!<br /><br />Overall I couldn't be happier. I would recommend this to any Metallica fan out there and those that gave up on them after AJFA or The Black Album... give this a spin, you won't be disappointed!
B001B71NOI|3.0|The downward spiral indeed. Reznor continues his artistic liberations via no record contracts, although it is becoming more and more clear that, unlike Radiohead, Nine Inch Nails used that platform to capitalize on its popularity and fan base by releasing sometimes less restrained, but almost always less detailed songs. The Slip works well enough to provide ample counterpoint to his last snooze-fest of industrial ambiance, Ghosts I-IV, with a way more uptempo, rocking vibe, but still continues down a path of sagging mediocrity. Reznor will always be a perceptive producer and offer intriguing soundscapes- even at his most generic or derivative, but it feels like the overall compositional quality has indeed slipped.
B001GQACGO|3.0|Like her re-issue of her previous album \\"B'Day\\" Beyonce puts out a double disc, double personality album. And While The first disc, Counting The Bonus Itunes/Japan Song \\"Save The Hero\\", is easlily worth a 4.5 star rating, disc 2 is another story. [[ASIN:B001KQIAXW If I Were A Boy]] is a great song about wondering what it'd be like to be in a man's shoes and is probably the best track from disc 1. \\"Broken Hearted girl\\" Is another beautiful ballad about not wanting to be heartbroken but the piano arrangment reminds me of \\"I'll Be there\\" By The Jackson 5. \\"That's why you're beautiful\\" : another great track with a self explainatory title. \\"Radio\\" has to be the worst Beyonce song I've heard. She goes on about how she she loves listening to the radio but she sings like she's 4 years old. \\"Sweet Dreams\\" or \\"Beautiful Nighmare\\" (what it was titled months ago when it was leaked) is another great track about being so deep in love. \\"Diva\\" is only half-way there. She raps on the track and while it's not great, it's not exactly horrible either. \\"Scared of lonely\\" is another great track about, well, The title is self explainatory. That Sasha Fierce in her is only half way there. The Album cuts, \\"Why Don't you love me\\" and \\"Save the hero\\" would have probably upped the review a star as they are some of Beyonce's best songs. Also, \\"B'Day\\" had an album cut (which Circuit city featured for the original release) Entitled \\"Back Up\\". That would have been perfect for disc 2.    Compaing this album to [[ASIN:B00007JRI6 Dangerously in Love]] and [[ASIN:B000NDIAWO B'day deluxe]], this is Number 3 on the \\"Best Beyonce Albums\\" list.    Best Tracks : If I were a boy, Sweet dreams, That's why you're beautiful, Scared of lonely, Save The Hero, Why don't you love me,     Least favorite tracks : Diva, Radio, Video phone,
B001GQACGO|5.0|Beyonce's third solo effort is here and once again, she does not disappoint. I Am...Sasha Fierce is far from the upbeat and dance-track heavy B'Day and even further from her old sound of Dangerously In Love. While those two albums were very good and went platinum multiple times, Ms. Fierce has entered the scene and has taken away any doubt that this woman holds a mass amount of talent.    Disk 1 begins with her first single, If I Were A Boy and no matter how many times I've heard this, I can never bring myself to skip it. Beyonce tries something new with this set and surprisingly, it works. Halo follows IIWAB and will easily become a favorite track. Her vocal abilities power through this song and I have to say that I am very excited to see the video to this as it will be her second single along with Ego from the Sasha Fierce side, which I will get to soon. Disappear is a smooth track that, even though might seem like an album filler, holds a good production and once again, Beyonce's voice captures you in this song. Broken-Hearted Girl will easily become another favorite on this album. This song, along with Ave Maria and Smash Into You are where Mrs. Knowles-Carter truly shows just why she is the queen in the game right now. You can hear the emotion in her voice and she sings her heart out to a production that starts off simple and easy with a piano but slowly progresses to a tougher beat. Satellites and That's Why You're Beautiful, though very good songs, can seem like another album filler but again, the song does not go wrong and Bee shines once again. On the iTunes bonus, Save The Hero has become another favorite of mine. The lyrics are amazing and Bee seems to capture the emotion of the song very well.    Single Ladies (Put A Ring On It) announces the arrival of the diva that is Sasha Fierce. Though this is clearly the disk that suggests that you loosen up and let the Sasha in you take over, vocally, she still shines and doesn't miss a beat. Radio becomes anothergood filler, if there is one, but leads into the female version \\"A Milli\\" called \\"Diva\\" where Beyonce pronounces that she's been the \\"Number one diva in this game for a minute\\" and frankly, I can not disagree. Sweet Dreams, which leaked months ago as Beautiful Nightmare, is fully completed and produced and sounds just as good as any other Beyonce track. (I can not wait to see this song become a video in her re-release video anthology). Video Phone is another filler track but leads into Hello and Ego - two songs that will easily become another pair of favorites. Scared Of Lonely, I feel, should have been on the the first disk as it isn't a dance track but once again, vocally, she brings it. The iTunes special Why Don't You Love Me, written by her sister, feel like a Dreamgirls track - but it definitely isn't a bad thing; she is much more vocally powerful than Deena Jones and her grunts add to track. I dare you to listen to that song without tapping, bobbing your head, or moving in some way.    The standouts of this album are: If I Were A Boy, Halo, Broken-Hearted Girl, Smash Into You, Save The Hero, Single Ladies, Diva, Hello, Ego, and Why Don't You Love Me.    Overall, Beyonce brings the heat once more and shows the current \\"singers\\" out there how to really do things.    5/5
B000VNMMQG|5.0|This movie is one of the \\"must sees\\" of our time. It brings to life a man only vaguely remembered by most people from their history class of long ago. It is excellently illustrated, acted and produced and makes me wonder why it didn't get more mention at the Academy awards. Anyway, I guess it is a sign of the times that anything that demonstrates the powerful results of faith in God gets little mention in the mass media. Thanks for reselling this. It was received in great condition and fast too.
B001KO3FFW|5.0|I just downloaded David Cook this morning, and each time I listen to it I like it more than the time before!<br /><br />A couple songs are a little bit harder than I was hoping, but even those ones will grow on me.<br /><br />If you like Daughtry and Nickleback, you'll be happy with David Cook.
B000066AXE|5.0|I'm very touched by the movie, especially the love of John Nash's wife to him. Love is patient, love is endurance, love is not just after one's own benefits, and love shines. And Jennifer Connelly's Oscar is well earned.    Highly recommended.
B000UYX5AI|5.0|I saw the \\"Mountains\\" video on tv and liked it very much. So I bought this latest album. From the first notes on, I thought, this is a special band. And the album turned out to be great. Really love it ! And it never left the cdplayer since. This is the best album of 2007.....and maybe 2008 ?
0375826726|2.0|Believe the other reviewers who are disappointed in this installment.  When we last left our hero, the Varden were on the banks of the Jiet River preparing for the final confrontation with the Empire.  700+ pages later, they've moved about 50 miles and are preparing for the final confrontation with the Empire.  In between . . . nothing happens.      Clearly the author and his publisher decided to stretch this \\"trilogy\\" into a \\"cycle\\" to make more money.  Which would be fine if we actually got more than three books out of the deal.  But Brisingr just provides filler, and bad filler at that.  By the end of these 700+ pages, I'll guaranty you're less invested with these characters, even annoyed with them and their paper thin personalities.      A shame this author had to grow up.
0385340567|2.0|I'm a Reacher fan, but this is a reach too far.  There's supposed to be some military checkpoint on a public highway that just gets ignored, and some town where everyone knows what's going on but word never gets out...  Ignore for a second the anti-Iraq propaganda.  The scale is simply too large to be believable.  This is a comic book, not a thriller.  Two stars is is probably generous, but I like the hero and the action.
B00129H7VS|5.0|Best Blu-Ray release so far.  Sound and picture quality completely justify the Blu-Ray format.
B001ACH4DS|5.0|The first time i listened to the entire album, about 6 or 7 of the songs popped out directly.   After listening the first time, i wanted to listen to it right again, and found that every single song can be a great hit.    I don't know if other people would like it or not, cause it's definitely not the \\"catchy pop record\\" which most people like, but this album totally works for me! I can't stop listening to it again and again and I will never get tired of his voice!    I think the most amazing thing about this album is David Cook's haunting, unique and beautiful voice. With that voice, he can rock any kind of music.     David Cook sings with his heart and soul, and that gives his music a beautiful spirit which is touching, powerful and full of depth.  For people who may not like him at first, please give a second try. Listen to it again with your heart, then you will find yourselves loving it and keep loving it forever.     Love it, totally.    and by the way, \\"Life on the Moon\\" is my current favorite!
0321356683|5.0|Greatest Java book ever written. In fact, it's beyond a 'java book', once many tips from here are 'universal tips'.    It's a great book for those who already have at least 4 or 5 programming years (code enough different projects), 'cause you'll notice several (apparently) minor mistakes that everyone make everyday.
B001GQ2TGA|5.0|When I heard of the new Enya album I became instantly happy and quite ready to let the Winter in. Finnaly it came, as Roma said. It's a beginning.    A Winter themed album. Quite interesting for Enya, even if it's a favourite theme for her (and for me). As I was thinking if the songs were more joyful or sober, I couldn't imagined that they could be so beautiful and sober at the same time.  As someone had written before - this new cd is more closer to \\"Watermark\\" than her previous cds. It's not a pop cd. Indeed it's sober, far from the poppiest \\"Amarantine\\". I think the arrangements are extremelly good. The layer of voices and the mood are as beautiful as a snowflake.    My personal favourites are \\"And Winter Came\\", the title theme, once again instrumental. The single \\"Trains And Winter Rains\\" is a very good song with catchy melodic rhythm. \\"Dreams Are More Precious\\" is another beautiful ethereal piece. \\"Stars And Midnight Blue\\" and \\"The Spirit Of Christmas Past\\" are the most wonderful songs in the album I must say, being \\"Stars And Midnight Blue\\" one of the most adult songs of Enya. Yes, it's that good!  Sadly I have to say that \\"My! My! Time Flies!\\" is the worst song ever written by Enya. I would had drop this one out off the album. The cheer song, although very American, \\"White Is In The Winter Night\\" is a gracious song ready to be sung on the holidays. In the other hand is the track \\"O Come, O Come, Emmanuel\\" wich is a more religious song, ence more European. Hope everyone would love this album as much as I do. Thank you Enya. Have a terrific Winter time!
B001GKJ2DO|5.0|I love a good musical and went to see Mamma Mia three times in the theaters, regardless of what D. Hinson's \\"one stare\\" review says.  You only need to look at what he has reviewed in the past to understand that he is a man with little taste in a good comedy/musical.<br /><br />The plot was original and the acting was superb.  Pierce Brosnan struggled with one of his songs but the entire movie was so lively and the songs were so well choreographed that it just didn't matter.<br /><br />I ordered Mamma Mia on Amazon and now just waiting for it to be released and sent out to me.  Once I get it I will take it down from my DVD shelf whenever I have a bad day at work and I know it will cheer me up, even if I don't finish watching all of it that night.  I can't wait.
B0018CWEYY|4.0|This is the season that has flash forward of what will be happening after getting of the island. I feel that it's a bit too revealing. I call those as spoilers. Many things expected such as who were the Oceanic 6. Who Sayid is after. Flash forward means that there's not much past to tell anymore. Overall, it's a very nice season because of the rescue + escape. Clare really had a small role in this season. Desmond stepped up to be one of the regulars. Locke continues his destiny thing. Ben is still using people and got nothing to lose at the end. Season 5 will probably being from what happened after moving the island and the Oceanic 6 unites in search for the island.

6305972591|4.0|This film is an absolute classic. I've seen this film numerous times and I never get tired of it. Both Courtney Gains (Malichi) and John Franklin (Issac) are great actors who should have won awards for their performances. On top of the acting, my copy of this film is autographed by the music composer, who is also my science  teacher's husband. So that fact alone make this film extra special to watch.

0060734191|5.0|This trilogy is absolutely amazing. Garth Nix is an amazingly descriptive author. I would give these novels 6 stars if I could. These novels hold your interest and do not lag once. They are told in such a way that you know the history of the mythical countries and magic without meaning to. I love these books and wish they had been part of a larger series. I recommend them to everyone.
B001KQKC0Q|1.0|I could only handle listening to this album once. I was a fan of Nickelback in their earlier years but this album is shockingly weak. All of the songs are cliche and unoriginal. and sound like they are being played (and were written) by 15-year-olds trying to rebel and shock their mommies by singing about sex and drugs (mostly sex). Not recommended.
1400079276|5.0|'Kafka on the Shore' is yet another great Murakami novel. I'd say people will either love it or find it annoying depending on what's their take on Murakami's highly recognizable style: first of all, Murakami writes surreal fiction, being often tagged as the literary equivalent of David Lynch. Not everyhting makes senses, many things are left unexplained and there are always passages that are more 'atmospheric' than related to an actual plot.<br />Secondly, there is always a great deal of (quintessentially japanese) orderileness in the way most characters behave. The way they prepare their lunch, pack their goods before leaving to somewhere...it is always described in a very methodical way which I find profoundly soothing. So you get this contrast between the surreal vibe of the narration and the extremely composed way most characters go through their daily routines. In this novel, this is best exemplified by Nakata, an old man who can prophesy the future and do extraordinary things but leads an otherwise simple and unassuming life.<br /><br />'Kafka on the shore' presents two main storylines, narrated in alternating chapters and somehow joining around the end: one chronicles the oedipal quest of a 15-years old runaway, who might have killed his father and slept with both his mother and sister. All of this is left unclear. Is it real? is it a make-believ fantasy? Is 'the boy named Crow' Kafka's superego or something else entirely? Don't look for answers because you won't find any, just like in a Lynch's movie, everyhting is alternatively dreamy or eerie with the contours always blurry.<br />The second storyline follows Mr. Nakata (actually everything begins with some X-files from the Second World War...), victim of a mysterious accident who left him 'not really bright'. This man, accompanied in his odissey by a drop-out trucker, doesn't know much about what he's doing, but is pushed forward in his travels by a mysterious force, amidst magic entrance stones, entities who take the form of several famous advertising characters, talking cats and leeches raining from the sky.<br /><br />All in all, Murakami is an acquired taste and, as such, may well polarize judgments but if you care for imaginative fiction and can accept a storyline that doesn't explain everyhting, then this novel is definitely a must.m of several famous advertising characters, talking cats and leeches raining from the sky.

B001GQACGE|4.0|Taking the unorthodox approach to this review let's talk about Sasha Fierce first. While we may have passed Sasha by in Destiny's Child with \\"Bug A Boo\\" and \\"Bootylicious\\" or even \\"Work It Out\\" on the Austin Powers in Goldmember soundtrack it was the 2005 hit \\"Check On It\\" that truly ushered in Sasha. She continued to rock the charts and the dance floor on \\"Get Me Bodied,\\" \\"Freakum Dress,\\" and \\"Ring The Alarm\\". On \\"I Am...Sasha Fierce\\" the diva takes it to the next level with \\"Single Ladies,\\" a follow up to the aforementioned \\"Get Me Bodied.\\" With pulsating beats, heel clicking giddiness and irresistible flow, Single Ladies fulfills what Beyonce once said about the song re-energizing confidence or even being overly confident.    While \\"Single Ladies\\" is a hot track, it is not the hottest on the `Sasha' portion of the album. In fact there are four other divalicious cuts on this side including what is expected to be the second single entitled \\"Ego.\\" Singing \\"I walk like this cause I can back it up, boy you a sight to see just like me\\" Sasha Fierce goes back and forth comparing her strength to her man's physique and vice-versa. In case you question her, Sasha says \\"ego so big ,you must admit, I got every reason to think that I'm that bitch...if you ain't know I don't need no beat I can sing it with piano.\\"    Revisiting the club, Sasha Fierce redefines the term `Diva' as a `female version of a hustler'. Brilliant and fiery, \\"Diva\\" could easily be an answer to Lil Wayne's \\"A Milli.\\" Stating the facts like Lil Wayne on \\"I'm Me\\" Sasha says \\"I done got so sick and filthy with Bengi's I can spit,\\" while also ensuring you understand her status in the game stating \\"been the number one diva in this game for a minute.\\" Continuing to fall in love with her sound, Sasha coos \\"I think I'm in love with my radio because it never lets me down\\" on \\"Radio,\\" a track produced by Jim Jonsin and Wayne Wilkins.    Rounding out the fiery four, Sasha Fierce, with the help of Sean Garrett and Shondrae Crawford, shows she's up to date with technology..specifically video on her phone. Expecting her `prey' to take video of her `like a cameo, I can handle you,\\" Sasha Fierce seems to be at her best on \\"Video Phone.\\" Daring, witty, up to date and seductive, \\"Video Phone\\" seems to be the furthest Sasha is going on this album - at least for the time being. She might come back for a repackaged album next year.    For the remainder of the 8 track Sasha Fierce portion of the album Beyonce zeros in on relationships, specifically referring to the now confirmed marriage to Jay-Z. Most evident on \\"Hello,\\" a track where Sasha, who seems to be back to being Beyonce says \\"You keep me humble out of this hype.\\" Seemingly singing an ode to her `Roc' Beyonce sings through the hook \\"You had me at Hello, it was many years ago.\\" Other notable tracks on this side of the album are \\"Sweet Dreams,\\" very similar if not the same as a well received track leaked earlier this year titled \\"Beautiful Nightmare\\" and \\"Scared Of Lonely\\" produced by Rodney Jerkins.    Shifting over to \\"I Am..,\\" the side Beyonce sees as the more personal side of the effort, it is clear that the former Destiny's Child star has grown most here. With songs like \\"Broken-Hearted Girl\\" and \\"Disappear\\" Beyonce shows true growth by diving into territory previously charted by Sarah McLaughlin, Jewel and most recently Leona Lewis. Speaking of Lewis, \\"I Am..\\" features \\"Halo\\" a single originally intended for the X-Factor star but well done by Beyonce.     \\"If I Were A Boy,\\" the lead single for \\"I Am...,\\" while similar to Ciara's \\"Like A Boy,\\" is arguably Beyonce's strongest record on this side.     Looking at the total picture \\"I Am...\\" is a heavily emotional disc with timeless melodies as proven on \\"Ave Maria,\\" a classic sprinkled with Beyonce's own lyrics. Other notable tracks on the \\"I Am..\\" side are \\"Smash Into You,\\" \\"Satellites\\" and the aforementioned \\"Disappear\\" which seems like a meeting of Beyonce and Coldplay.    While the songs on Beyonce's first disc are great, just a few of them are truly defining. Bottom line, Sasha Fierce looks to be winning this battle with at least four defining tracks that are sure to raise some eyebrows.    So the answer you've been waiting for.... Beyonce has grown up, she's in love and she's happy to sing about it, but Sasha is more fierce and memorable in terms of quantity which counts when you're picking up a double disc. [...]
B001EGFQNU|5.0|Jason W. Bellenger's long and very detailed review trumps anything I could say tecnically.<br />I do agree with all he said about the CD and the DVD.<br /><br />There is ONE reason to buy this set and that is for the 31 promo videos.<br />I had only seen less than 10 of these over the years and a few of those I have only recently viewed on a UK Remaster of Architecture and Morality from 2003. Subtract those and it's a small number that I've seen and I've been a OMD fan since their first UK release.<br />The DVD is region free so it will play here in Region 1 country.<br /><br />P.S. I wish there had been vids for \\"88 seconds In Greensboro\\" and \\"Native Daughters of the Golden West\\" but they were not singles but \\"88 Seconds\\" has the most awesome opening of any OMD song; 38 seconds of drums, guitars and thumping bass---they sound quite Hard Rock for a short bit.  [It's on Crush--and I'm not joking.]
B00062RCBW|1.0|This is the third time in a year I have tried to warn people off of this set.  The two other times, my review never showed up here.  Censored.  Not sure why.  But here goes try #3.<br /><br />Beware - some companies (Amazon Market, not Amazon itself) with little feedback (because they do business, then change their name when the heat is on) are selling off Chinese BOOTLEG copies.  They are poor quality low-res copies that are cut off at the end.  Instead of a dual-layer, it compresses four one-hour episodes on a single layer (4.7gb) DVD.  One company that sells these is based out of Arizona (I guess I can't name the company - it changes names all the time anyway).  The bootleg can be confirmed by looking the product up on the Internet.  On the box, it says something about someone winning the Academy Award in a particular year - and there was no such award for that person.  I don't remember the details any more.  But it comes in a different box than what was ordered - It has a big \\"2\\" on it and says it is \\"The Chosen Collection.\\"  If you get this one, return it right away.  If they give you a hard time, threaten to report them to the FBI - that's how I finally got my money back.  BTW, although they say they are an Amazon Market store, they will have an issue with the order and ask you to buy direct through them.  For your inconvenience, they will give you an additional small discount.  This gets them off the hook with Amazon and their customer satisfaction guarantee.  So if you buy, beware companies with small amounts of feedback, different packaging, and the attempt to have you buy direct instead of through Amazon.<br /><br />I hope this helps people keep from getting ripped off and I hope Amazon finally releases this review.<br /><br />Jim

0132350882|4.0|Before I even read the book, I liked the fact that the title contained the words \\"software\\" and \\"craftsmanship\\" next to each other! This alone is a good reason for many programmers to keep this book where they can see it - every day. The book is well structured, it is well and thoughtfully written - something you would expect from a book of this kind.  I am happy to see a book that - in clear and simple terms - promotes what the great Edsger Dijkstra (considered the Father of the Computing Science by many) had been advocating all his life: elegance, simplicity, and intellectual manageability of software. There have been many articles popping up here and there, addressing various aspects of coding standards and general quality of code. Such articles usually would result in heated discussions, mostly fueled by personal preferences, pride, unwillingness of some people to admit that they hadn't been doing things right always... A book like this was needed..     It's good to see a serious book from a serious author who, for example, finally is not afraid to state: \\"Use unchecked exceptions. The debate is over\\". This is music to my ears. Surprisingly, however, the author uses checked exceptions in many of his examples! That seems like a really strange oversight. Any plans to fix that in the 2nd edition, Robert?  Also, I think the author only scratches the surface explaining why checked exceptions are \\"not necessary\\". What is missing is the explanation why checked exceptions are not safe, in the first place. Most of us know that they result in bad and convoluted code. The bigger problem, however, is that they usually result in incorrect error handling in general. And there is quite a bit of confusion and misunderstanding when it comes to error handling among Java programmers - to this day. So, I am afraid, this particularly important advice from the book will be ignored by many programmers raised on checked exceptions - simply due to the lack of clear explanation and the confusing code examples that use checked exceptions.    While I think it is a very good book, I generally agree with one of the earlier reviewers that some topics are covered without the depth necessary to fully illustrate the practice or issue in question.    As one would reasonably expect, some recommendations may have to be taken with a grain of salt. For example, should we really never use HTML in javadocs? Most of us use IDEs that have excellent support for javadoc viewing via key-shortcuts - by simply pointing to the class or method's name anywhere in the code. I never pull up the method's source to read the in-line Javadoc for it as is. I place the cursor on the method name right where the method is referenced, and do Ctrl-Q in IntelliJ. The nicely formatted Javadoc appears in a pop-up window, so I actually like taking full advantage of any HTML formatting. Eclipse or NetBeans users use similar ways. So, I'd say, use common sense, and make sure the comments are informative, and neat. Which is pretty much what the book says anyway.     By the way, speaking of comments, most code examples in the book contain none of those at all! How come? Another strange oversight... I certainly understand that the author assumes that there is no need for javadocs and comments in the sample code since he explains everything in the text of the chapter. However, consistency is another important rule that the author advocates, and I would prefer to see the sample code follow all the same rules the author is promoting in his book.    One of my favorite parts of the book is Chapter 17 - \\"Smells and Heuristics\\". This is a great reference guide for any beginner or anyone who only now starts to show interest in writing quality code. Fortunately, most common IDEs today can be configured to inspect your code and look for each of the anomalies listed in that chapter. Turn those inspections on and never ignore them!     The bottom line is that Software Engineering is a CRAFT, indeed. At the end of the day, a programmer should be able to look at his/her work and be proud of it. Those who don't care should probably find a different occupation. For everyone else, this book is a must-read.     (Disclaimer: This review is based on the electronic copy of the book; the hard copy is still on its way from amazon.com at the time of this writing.)
B001GQACGO|5.0|Beyonce has always, and will always, be criticized by the public. But, when it comes to her new album I AM...SASHA FIERCE, how can you not hear the greatness of this album?    This album is her best work-to-date, even though I loved her sophomore effort, B'DAY, SASHA FIERCE is amazingly 'fierce'.    Starting off with \\"If I Were a Boy,\\" the leading single, and it's an ok song...not one of my favorites. But when it comes to \\"Disappear,\\" \\"Broken-Hearted Girl,\\" \\"Halo\\" (second single), \\"Ave Maria,\\" \\"Smash Into You,\\" and \\"Satellites,\\" we see a new side of Beyonce's we've never seen before, and all these songs can easily pass off as classics, and that's exactly what they sound like.  Disc 1 is comprised of all slow songs, which I was nervous at first to listen, but once I heard them, I instantly fell in love. THIS IS A NEW BEYONCE...so check it out!    Overall, Disc 1 on I AM...SASHA FIERCE is amazing, you just have to take a listen to the exquisiteness of it!    Now on Disc 2 on I AM...SASHA FIERCE, I was a little disappointed by \\"Radio,\\" \\"Video Phone,\\" and partly with \\"Hello.\\"  \\"Single Ladies (Put a Ring On It)\\" is the highlight of Disc 2. Easily following \\"Sweet Dreams\\" (formally known as \\"Beautiful Nightmare\\"), \\"Ego\\" (second single), and \\"Diva\\" is a really fun 'female' version of Lil' Wayne's \\"A Milli.\\"    I definitely recommend this album! I will say that most of mainstream listeners will really enjoy Disc 1 of SASHA FIERCE, so I recommend checking this CD out. It's a really great album, more mature, more focused, and less 'Pop Diva' like Beyonce (circa \\"B'Day,\\" \\"Dangerously In Love.\\")
B001ACH4DS|4.0|Wow, this is an actual album, not some slap and dash production. I want to give it 5 stars but because people are too generous with their ratings, I won't. C'mon, 5 stars for a Jessica Simpson CD? ** UPDATED ** I now own this CD. It's fantastic but still 4 stars for the same reason as noted above. Bar-Ba-Sol is my favorite and oddly, I find it to be the \\"rockiest\\" of the songs on here. Usually, I tend to more pop or traditional tunes. Way cool CD. Good job, DC.
1401203078|3.0|Compared to the first two installments of this series, Black Dossier is an extrodinary letdown to fans everywhere. The \\"tell rather than show\\" review is absolutely accurate. This book is dense and sometimes very boring. Dispite all the layers and layers of information and background, Black Dossier manages to accomplish nothing. Alan Moore is a rare genius, but unfortunately, his intellect and imagination prevent him from focusing on one specific direction/storyline in this installment. This may very well be required reading for League fans when the Century Series hits stores; however, until then, I'd suggest you get your action-pulp-fix by reading some Verne, Burrows, or Lovecraft.
0385340990|4.0|The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society is a charming trip into post WWII England and the Channel Islands. Much as you would hang by your mailbox waiting for a letter from a friend, you are caught up in the correspondence mode of writing, as the story is told through letters. Similar to the BBC film Island at War, PPPie is about the German occupation of the Channel Islands. The characters are heartwarming, and memorable. I have given several books to friends who are also in reading discussion groups...which border on \\"ladies who read and eat\\". It went down like tuna noodle casserole and a cup of tea.
B00026WU7I|5.0|[[ASIN:B00026WU7I Blood on the Tracks]] (1975) may not be Bob Dylan's greatest album, but it is certainly his most perfect. There isn't a single wasted moment on this flawless classic, and as it intently flows from start to finish with scarred passion and fresh acoustic beauty, it presents the listener with a clear image of the isolation, resentment and (sometimes) vindication that Dylan seemed to be experiencing at the time.<br /><br />I wouldn't exactly call [[ASIN:B00026WU7I Blood on the Tracks]] a concept album, but the theme of a relationship that has fallen apart is apparent in nearly every song here. The collapse of Bob's marriage to Sara Lowndes is said to be the inspiration for the album.<br /><br />One of the things that sets [[ASIN:B00026WU7I Blood on the Tracks]] apart from many of Dylan's other albums is the sheer beauty of it's sound. The wonderful melodies and handsome acoustic musical arrangements are just as remarkable as Dylan's poignant and thoughtful lyrics here. Where Dylan's singing and lyrics often carry the lion's share of the weight on his albums, here the crisp production gives the acoustic guitars and other instruments a chance to step up and add a whole new dimension of excellence to every song.<br /><br />Pain, sadness, loneliness, anger and regret run through the songs here like a sharp silver thread of naked emotion. Tangled Up In Blue opens the album with a 5:42 minute folk/pop confession of a relationship dying and Dylan drifting across the country with his broken-hearted loneliness as a traveling companion.<br /><br />But all the while I was alone<br />The past was close behind<br />I seen a lot of women<br />But she never escaped my mind<br />And I just grew<br />Tangled up in blue<br /><br />Dylan angrily lashes out in the seething 7:48 minutes of Idiot Wind, a venomous hate epic that matches even legends like Positively 4th Street and Like A Rolling Stone.<br /><br />Idiot wind blowing through the flowers on your tomb<br />Blowing through the curtains in your room<br />Idiot wind blowing every time you move your teeth<br />You're an idiot babe<br />It's a wonder that you still know how to breathe<br /><br />At 8:51 minutes, Lily, Rosemary And The Jack Of Hearts is the longest song on the album, and also one of the more interesting. Over a country bass, brushed drums and church organ, Dylan strums his acoustic guitar, plays harmonica and sings a cinematic narrative using wild-west poker game images and intrigue.<br /><br />Simple Twist Of Fate quietly tells the lonely tale of a sleazy rendezvous in the city and If You See Her, Say Hello is heartbreakingly lonely and the saddest song on the album. Meet Me In The Morning and Buckets Of Rain explore folk/blues flat-top guitar picking, and Shelter From The Storm is an acoustic guitar traditional folk saga of a forsaken Dylan and the unidentified woman who offers him comfort and salvation.<br /><br />I heard newborn babies wailin' like a morning dove<br />And old men with broken teeth stranded without love<br />Do I understand your question man, \\"Is it hopeless and forlorn?\\"<br />\\"Come in,\\" she said, \\"I'll give ya shelter from the storm.\\"<br /><br />[[ASIN:B00026WU7I Blood on the Tracks]] is one of Bob Dylan's best albums.

B001EOQWF8|1.0|I'm rating the Blu-ray 2-disc edition only, not the film. I preordered the Blu-Ray versioin of Wall-E months before its release--at the time there was no description. As the release date neared, Disney started running ads touting the Blu-Ray with the digital download. I thought it would be great to have a choice of watching it on my HDTV or iPhone. When my package arrived (a day early), I quickly opened it and looked for instructions on getting the download. When I couldn't find any info, I checked Amazon and discovered that now there are two versions of the Blu-ray. This two disc package and a three disc one. Only the three disc version comes with the digital download. Worse, both are priced the same. Amazon, you ripped me off.    Since I opened the disc already, I'm sure I can't return it. Maybe I can save you the same mistake. Be careful which you buy.
B001KQKC0Q|4.0|Sequels sometimes have a lot to live up to but this one doesn't disappoint.  It has the capacity to appeal to a variety of tastes depending on the song from the romantic to bold rock.  Some of the language is a little much for me on a few songs but it's like I said that there is something for everyone.    For me, the highlights and soul of the album in track order:    Gotta be somebody (Easily the best song that anyone can identify with)    I'd come for you (Makes my heart melt)    Never going to be alone (Probably will be heard at a few weddings)    S.E.X. (Straight to the point but a good tease too)    If today was your last day (Good way to approach each day)
B0017VG69U|4.0|Given that this is obviously the issue before the Blu-Ray version, perhaps it should come packaged in a red shirt. For those of us who resist the HD charms to come, this is fine, though the extras on the first issue should have been included. Of the three seasons, this is the most stable without the lows of the other two (when it could sink to \\"Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea\\" level, as in \\"Spock's Brain\\", the ludicrous first episode of season three, or the standard space monster plot of the very first broadcast) and with several very good episodes. The acting relationships were well established, and the cast secure in their jobs, so they could riff on each other and Shatner could show some humor, though his opinion of his own acting as revealed in the better image is, well, over the top. He is always one of those actors who wears his ego on his sleeve. Roddenberry would have certainly done the better space effects here if he could have afforded them at the time, whether or not he would have wanted the specific choices made (relative to the material, those shots for instance of the circling vehicles in \\"Tribbles\\" are nifty). They do invite comparisons for the series to more recent sci-fi productions which on a technical level it can't win, so it's a trade-off. As if your childhood lunches were retroactively made with home baked organic bread; you're a half-inch taller so it's better but you remember and miss the memory of the Wonder Bread all the same.     One unmixed improvement is the colors - which are fauvistically vibrant in many scenes, with very imaginative lighting, very Jack Kirby primary colors used in bold patterns. Like hearing remastered Rolling Stones singles in mono, they didn't ever come through the broadcast channels like this. At this point, there's not a lot to discover in these stories if you grew up with them, but if you want to relive it it's done well. \\"Star Trek\\" was the Grimm's fairy tales of the boomer generation. The packing is visually fun but the packaging engineer is no Scotty, mallomars are more carefully enclosed. Given the price (though it's down from the last issue) it could be more ergonomically sound. That thin piece of floppy squared off plastic that slides around the plain multi-disk pack is doomed to die on a lonely planet just before the second commercial.
0765316897|4.0|As I said in the title, it has a very unexpected ending. I pride myself in the fact that I can figure out endings of movies, games and books, but this one I didn't see coming whatsoever.    Overall the book is great. An enjoyable read from the first page.  I highly recommend this read to anyone.    Brandon Sanderson is a very gifted writter. I must come clean about something though, I had never heard of Brandon Sanderson prior to the death of \\"The Wheel of Time\\" author, Robert Jordan. Mr Sanderson was approached to write the remainder of \\"Memory of Light,\\" the final book in The Wheel of Time sega (which I am a fan of) so I had to examine his writing style for myself. I was then swept away into the great story of Mistborn.    Pick this book up.
B001C08RHA|5.0|This movie is great! I am looking forward to the next one. I hear that Robert Downey, Jr. has already signed to do it.
B000U1ZV8K|5.0|Great Movies. As a package together, a great value. I usually only watch the films, & seldom the 'extra' stuff, so the extra was not really missed. Makes for a great Saturday morning film festival without the commentator or the commercials.
0375423877|4.0|To be honest, I started this book about 3 times and then put it down, until I read the reviews here on Amazon.  It was recommended to me by a friend who said I would love it, but I did not know what the heck it was about at first.  Then I read the reviews and started it again and I love it.  I am about halfway through, and really enjoy \\"Precious\\" s character and her honest take  on life.  It is a lovely, honest book  about life in Africa and the detective agency Precious creates.  I will defintiely check out the next books in the series!
B001JOIEZ4|5.0|I LOVE LOVE LOVE this soundtrack.  I'm 25 and not as into alternative music as I used to be, and at first I was a little put off by the obscurity of a couple of the groups presented.  I hated the Muse song & the Perry Farrell song, and didn't care for the rest of them.  I contented myself listening to the Mutemath & Paramore songs over and over.  Gradually though, I broke out of my rut and the rest of the album snuck in, track by track.  I have listened to it nonstop since the day it came out.  I am rereading Twilight now and it seems a little more real because almost every song on the soundtrack is so atmospheric, but with an edge.   A couple notes:  Check out Bella's Lullaby composer Carter Burwell's blog.  He tells the story of how the song was born, and how he never wanted it to be called Bella's Lullaby, because he wrote it as 'Love Theme'.  He talks of the studio wanting a sweet little piano piece, which he could not provide.  He never intended for the whole piece to become the Lullaby and feels that it will inevitably disappoint those expecting the sweet, simple piano melody.    Rob Pattinson's music is not a highlight here.  I was impressed by his talent, and agree wholeheartedly with the comparisons to Jeff Buckley.  However, there is not much substance here, and his great vocal talent is lost under his mumbling.  It fits in with the soundtrack because it is so atmospheric, but try to remember that he is not an experienced recording artist.    Bottom line:  You are missing out if you don't get this soundtrack.
6300268985|3.0|I had wanted to see \\"Lisztomania\\" since first reading about it in the brilliant \\"Golden Turkey Awards\\" in 1980. True to its reputation, Roger Daltrey plays Franz Liszt in a highly stylized (major understatement) manner as an oversexed rock star, singing his way from one predicament to another and making an arch enemy of Richard Wagner, who exists solely to subjugate the world to Nazi Germany, and who is a vampire on the side. I appreciated that Wagner's hat said \\"Nietzsche,\\" which made his philosophy somewhat evident early on. Nice touch, Ken.<br /><br />In the midst of this bedlam Pope Ringo (I'm not kidding: Ringo Starr is the Pope, complete with eye patch and cowboy boots) makes Liszt attempt to convert Wagner to Catholicism in exchange for his (the Pope's) permission for Liszt to marry. Confused? Don't be. Director Ken Russell explained in an interview at the time of release that \\"the past attracts me because when dealing with it you don't have to be historically accurate\\", then helpfully adds that \\"Lisztomania\\" is \\"pure fantasy based on fact rather than straight factual biography.\\" I'll say.<br /><br />What this liberty with the truth gives Russell license to do here is stultifying: I am still most amazed by the scene in which Liszt is tormented by noxious flatus from rectum-shaped wall fixtures, then performs a musical number featuring his ten foot long phallus, which meets a guillotine before it's all over. Understated, you say? Well perhaps you will enjoy the death harpsichord, the pipe organ spaceship, and a prolonged familial scene done as Charlie Chaplin. Yes, that's right: Roger Daltrey playing Franz Liszt playing Charlie Chaplin. I would say that this isn't \\"straight factual biography,\\" although I don't actually know what it is.<br /><br />\\"Lisztomania\\" is absolutely impossible to rate: there are some entertaining moments, and some surrealistic moments of brilliance, but there are also loads of miscues and plain bad acting in abundance. This film is unquestionably for adults only, and I'm giving it three stars as my best guess. Your own appraisal will depend entirely on your viewpoint: there are people who think it's utterly brilliant, while others (probably many more others) find it pretentious and over the top. I think it has value as a touchstone of 1970's overexuberance (and drugs, no doubt.) The one thing I can say without question about \\"Lisztomania\\" is that it's never predictable and never boring.only, and I'm giving it three stars as my best guess.

B000WC3A0S|5.0|Received in excellent condition, and considering i ordered it 1 week before my sons birthday. It arrived in plenty of time.  Thank you.
B001GM28HO|1.0|Lady Gaga's \\"The Fame\\" is an excessive foray into mindless self indulgence.  There's nothing remotely interesting about the singer, nor her tiring album.  Most of the songs sound the same, lacking any sense of urgency or danceable beat.  She sprinkles rap into them to make them even more annoying.  I can't recommend this in any case.
B000WCBPOG|5.0|I originally purchased the single disc version of this soundtrack, but after a few weeks of listening to it, and seeing the movie another time, I decided that I wanted ALL of the songs. The songs are slightly different from the movie, presumably to make a better soundtrack experience, but only a close listener should be able to discern the differences. As a whole, if you love the movie, or The Beatles, then you'll like this soundtrack.
B000ASATWQ|5.0|I absolutely love this CD. I play it during long car rides or during workouts and it always gets me in the mood to dance.
B001GQACGO|5.0|I have listened to this CD 3 times in a row and I just bought it today!  I love Beyonce anyway, she is definitely doing it! My fav track is \\"Diva\\". This is much better than her last CD. I wish her much success and happiness in her career!
B001EOQWEO|5.0|I cannot describe Wall-e in just few words.Before watching this film,I thought this was going to be a classic Pixar movie,just fun and entertaining.But Wall-e has already passed that line.This movie is very clever in a sense that it is close to Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey.
B001ACH4DS|4.0|I must admit I am stunned!<br /><br />I find it ironic that David Cook looks like a pedophile and the runner up on American Idol, David Archuleta, looks like a pedophile's dream. David needs to lower his eye lids a bit on the cover of his CD because he looks like he's ready to pounce on his prey (helpless little boys). But I digress.<br /><br />I'm a music lover and I'm pretty much into every genre except country. I can handle certain types of country singers like Shania Twain & Leann, but that's about it. I picked up David's album because he has a really unique voice. His type of husky, I just smoked a pack of ciggies, fits perfectly into rock. They blend in together seamlessly. I must say that it was hard to find a dull song on this album. I think David worked with the right producers & songs writers on his debut CD. Every song starts off just right and then brings in the hard hitting drums & bass effortlessly. Definitely worth picking up.
B001E75QGG|4.0|This is pretty much a must have for Indiana Jones fans. The blu ray version with a good sound system gives you better results than in any theater, accept for possibly Imax.       A few surprises and a good ending make it alot of fun.
B001GQACGO|4.0|My first major complaint is that the album has 16 songs & she has the nerve to do a double disc release which means consumers must shell out an extra few dollars as oppose to the typical ten on a new release. In all honesty, there was no need for the standard edition to even be released.<br /><br />I must say disc 1 is pretty spectacular. The 1st disc consist mostly of ballads and it really showcases her vocals in a new light. We all know she can sing. Even though in a lot of tracks that she's released, it seems as if she cant stop yelling. Halo is probably the most amazing song on the first CD. Ryan Tedder, lead singer of the group ONeRepublic & amazing song writer extradonaire delivers an awesome song for Ms. Knowles. I hope this is the 2nd single. Its a beautiful song & she sings it beautifully.<br /><br />Disc 2 is where everything kinda falls apart. There are a few good songs such as Ego, Single Ladies, & Hello. But the rest is really unsual. I get what she was aiming for but it didnt get executed properly. Plus her voice sounds down right annoying in some of the tracks. I felt she was trying to hard to deliver an upbeat album.<br /><br />I'm glad she released this album & i found the concept to be interesting. Of course it would have been nice to have a couple of more tracks. I totally agree that Beyonce cant handle competition & does all that she can to stake her claim as the #1 R&B singer of the moment. I think the fact that she feels soooo compelled to constantly be at #1 will only make her a better artist. Kinda like cell phones, the more carriers there are the more mins each carrier will offer to beat the competition. Except Verizon & AT&T dont seem to get that concept.<br /><br />Stand out tracks:<br />If I Were a Boy<br />Halo (Best song on here 15/10)<br />Disappear<br />Broken-Hearted Girl<br />Ave Maria<br />Smash Into You<br />Satellites
0789318121|2.0|I love the movie, and i love to get inspired by artbook, but this book like other said its 3/4 script, major disappointment, barely any concept, and the art work wasnt all that fantastic.  If you guys love movies artbook, i suggest the superman return artbook and the Xmen2 book, its full of awsome concept, storyboard, etc. Or most of the pixar book except a couple... like the incredible...
B001ACH4DS|5.0|David Cook has an amazing voice. His new album sends chills down my spine. I absolutely love \\"Come Back to Me\\" and \\"Lie\\"! \\"Permanent\\" blows me away. It is so powerful and heartfelt. Great job Mr. Cook.
B001ACH4DS|5.0|I have already in love with \\"Analog Heart\\" and I get the same awesomeness feeling with this album. It shows David's diversity, from hardcore track to moving ballads. I know that I love his ballads more (\\"Lie\\", \\"Avalanche\\", and \\"Permanent\\" are now forever my favorite from this album) but I also enjoy his more rocking one, especially \\"Declaration\\" that he co-writes with Johnny Rzeznik -- which I think deserves to be his first single (instead of \\"Light On\\")    The only inclusion that I can live without is \\"The Time of My Life\\". I know that it's his coronation song, but it doesn't really fits with the whole tune of the album    Final Judgement: B
6305291446|1.0|Halloween H20 is the worst horror flick ever! I can't believe Jamie Lee Curtis reprised her iconic role as Laurie Strode. Halloween is such a classic film, all the sequels are stupid and not even scary. Josh Hartnett and Michelle Williams over do it here, the whole Laurie and Michael Myers are brother and sister is so calculated, I didn't like Halloween 2 and I don't like this one either.
B000FIMHLC|5.0|Wilko Johnson had always adored Johnny Kidd & The Pirates and especially their guitar player Mick Green - and tucked away on the B-side of their 1964 hit \\"Always & Forever\\" (HMV POP 1269) was an obscure cover version of a Piano Red song from 1962 on Okeh Records called \\"Doctor Feelgood\\" (Red's group was actually called Dr. Feelgood & The Interns). Wilko chose this apt name for his new rockin' band - and a kick ass British rhythm 'n' blues legend was born.<br /><br />The line up for their debut was:<br />LEE BRILLEAUX on Lead Vocals and Harmonica<br />WILKO JOHNSON on Lead Guitar and Vocals<br />JOHN B. SPARKS on Bass<br />THE BIG FIGURE on Drums and Vocals (real name John Martin)<br /><br />This 2CD June 2006 COLLECTORS EDITION is a celebration of their explosive 1975 debut album \\"Down By The Jetty\\" - and is an absolute peach of a reissue - it really is. There's a lot on offer here, so let's get to the details:<br /><br />Disc 1 (56:33 minutes):<br />Tracks 1 to 13 are the album \\"Down By The Jetty\\" issued in January 1975 on United Artists UAS 29727. It was deliberately recorded and issued in MONO. 11 of the 13 tracks are Wilko Johnson originals complimented by two covers \\"Boom Boom\\" by John Lee Hooker and the Larry Williams/Champs duo of \\"Bonie Moronie/Tequila\\".<br />\\"Bonie Moronie/Tequila\\" ends the album and was recorded live at Dingwalls in 1974 (some of the rest of that live set now turns up on Disc 2 - see below).<br /><br />Track 14 is \\"(Get Your Kicks On) Route 66\\", a Bobby Troup/Nat King Cole/Chuck Berry cover version and the non-album B-side to their debut 7\\" single in the UK \\"She Does It Right\\" issued November 1974 on United Artists UP 35760. The A-side opens Side 1 of the album.<br /><br />Tracks 15 to 18 are Previously Unreleased MONO Studio Outtakes from the sessions.<br />\\"I'm A Hog For You Baby\\" and \\"Stupidity\\" later turned up on their third LP in 'live' form - the Number 1 album \\"Stupidity\\" issued in September 1976.<br /><br />Disc 2 (76:23 minutes):<br />Tracks 1 to 12 are the \\"Down By The Jetty\\" studio album issued for the first time in STEREO (minus the last track - the duo of live covers).<br /><br />Tracks 13 to 16 are studio outtakes from the sessions in STEREO<br /><br />Tracks 17 to 23 were recorded live in Dingwalls in Camden Lock, London, 8 July 1974 - the same date as \\"Boney Moronie/Tequila\\".<br />(All 23 tracks on Disc 2 are Previously Unreleased).<br /><br />Recorded at Rockfield Studios in Monmouth in the Wye Valley of Wales in August 1974, \\"Jetty\\" was produced `live in the studio' by Vic Maile of The Who's \\"Live At Leeds\\" fame. The 2CDs are housed in a 4-way foldout digipak with an outer plastic wrap and the 12-page booklet has liner notes by WILL BIRCH, a repro of the United Artists press release and colour outtakes from the album cover sessions. There's also a brief interview with Wilko Johnson, Bob Geldof (the Rats were huge fans), track-by-track details, reissue credits etc. They abandoned the colour cover and eventually used photos on the front and back that deliberately aped the black and white pose and look of the MC5 album \\"Back In The USA\\" (the Feelgoods were big fans).<br /><br />Remastered from the 1st generation tapes by PETER MEW at Abbey Road - the sound quality is FANTASTIC - everything you would have hoped for - really clean, muscular and live in your living room. Some of the stereo tracks do have a slightly lop-sided two-channel feel to them, but it's still a thrill to hear them in this form - their menace and almost punk excitement undiminished by decades. Megastore prices for the hard copy can be as high as £22, online it's about £15 and from iTunes at only £10 - the complete 2CD download is fabulous value for money.<br /><br />To sum up - this is a great reissue of an album that thoroughly deserves the Deluxe treatment - just so enjoyable.<br /><br />The Feelgoods are beloved - and a version of the original band is still gigging to this day - 34 years after the event. I oncesaw Lee Brilleaux clacking his way down Berwick Street in 1989 in his steel-capped loafers and sharp suit - he was gone by so fast, I hadn't time to stop him and tell him how much I loved him and every incarnation of the band since. It's a slight memory I know - but one I cherish - that's how I much I love the Feelgoods.  They sent shivers down my backbone...and God bless you mate wherever you may be...<br /><br />PS: Dear EMI - roll on deluxe editions of \\"Stupidity\\" and \\"Doctor's Orders\\" too...so fast, I hadn't time to stop him and tell him how much I loved him and every incarnation of the band since.

B001KQKC0Q|4.0|good cd, not another ATRR, but they never meant it to be. every song is enjoyable, and although not a musical masterpiece, i never judge nickelback in the vein of \\"musical masterpiece\\", simply on the enjoyment factor, which is high with some rock songs, such as the lead rock single, somthing in your mouth, and some of their signature ballads, such as never gonna be alone.
B001H5X7JS|3.0|First up, this has some incredibly funny scenes in it. There are parts when I was laughing fit to burst.<br /><br />The only trouble is, these bits were spread out in between some very lame or average parts which lasted far longer. On the whole the film outstays its welcome, but it's worth seeing for the few bits that really are extremely good.<br /><br />A shame it wasn't consistently good, then it would have been worth five stars.<br /><br />[[ASIN:1906669023 Sherlock Holmes and the Flying Zombie Death Monkeys]]
055357342X|4.0|I've got two books of my own published and have worked like a dog to achieve that. And here comes George R. R. Martin with this gigantic book and larger series and breaks every rule--and charms me! Totally. I have to say--I'm mad at the literary establishment. The teachers and professors at writing conferences tell us don't do this: And then Martin does, and it works.<br /><br />But who needs a 1200+ page novel? This cult favorite breaks every rule of the literary fiction/creative writing major/MFA crowd. It's got more characters than an ant hill has ants. A hundred story lines moving forward in a dizzying, incomprehensible maze. Names. Dates. Serial numbers. It's huge. Martin makes no attempt at creating a beginning, middle and end to this multi-volume epic--not to the whole thing or any volume. He just ends the thing--probably when he couldn't lift the manuscript any more--leaving threads untied, tales unfinished. Readers drooling.<br /><br />My editors and writing coaches would ring their hands at this monster. But they haven't sold like Martin does, and they haven't created a very large jewel like this, either.<br /><br />I loved it and started the next volume immediately. I'm not even done with that, and I'm asking my daughter, \\"Wasn't there a sequel on the way?\\" \\"Did you say there's a chapter to be downloaded?\\"<br /><br />It's addictive and I'm addicted. No one can describe pageantry or create an imaginary world like Martin.<br /><br />I gave the book 4 stars rather than 5 because of the publisher's cruelty to the reader. Packing this mother around was painful. It could be marketed as a form of exercise or maybe even a weight loss program. It's just too big. Why couldn't they have packaged it into two 600+ page books rather than this gigantic phone book? And why the submicroscopic print in the mass paperback versions? Please, you've got addicts, treat them nicely.<br /><br />I'm midway through book 4 of the series and expect to wait, panting, for the next volume.
B000Z8GZYW|5.0|One of my favourite films. This has incredible one liners, great slapstick, Bill Murray at his best and a really strange but completely great premise behind the whole thing.<br /><br />Superb.<br /><br />[[ASIN:1906669023 Sherlock Holmes and the Flying Zombie Death Monkeys]]
B0000AQS0F|5.0|This series was amazing.  I thoroughly enjoyed the writing, acting, directing, and story lines.  I can't believe the series was cancelled.
B001GQACGO|2.0|Bottom line...this album is not worth the money. For someone who puts themselves on the highest pedestal possible, whether its her willing to outshine or overshine every female artist who dare to dominate the #1 spot (even her own group members), Beyonce really took a drink of confidence of splitting a 1 LP album into 2....NICE TRY!!!    There's nothing here that brings out the Beyonce she knows she's supposed to be. So its obvious that listening to this album is a fascade to the ear...with the exception of \\"Halo\\", where she pulls off a nice Leona Lewis challenge, and the actually BANGER on this entire package is \\"Scared Of Lonely\\". Those 2 songs are the reason for the 2 stars.    Once again.....It's not worth it. Unless you are a CD collector or you just wanna see some sexy pics (5 star photography lol....hmmmm), this isn't worth your money.
B001ACH4DS|5.0|Its no LIE.... My Declaration of why this album rocks :  My review & experience of David Cook's self titled major label debut cd (so far!)<br /><br />Once I got to work, and settled in, put in my ear bud to my ipod, and began to listen properly from start to finish.  Now that I've had one listen through, now time to replay the music again and write my thoughts down.<br /><br />I am so impressed with the fact David has been allowed not to be like most typical idol winners that has to put out a debut album of pop music that is sugary sweet.  I am glad he was able to be himself and be the rock musician that he is.  He worked with some people known for rock music as well and I have to say it was worthwhile wait to see what they and David came up with for this album.  Not many idols have managed to keep my attention over time, and David will be in the category with Idol runner-up Clay Aiken from 2003 (as Clay still can keep my attention despite his producers picking alot of bad stuff for him to sing but his voice still captivates me).<br /><br />Here is the track listing:<br /><br />1. Declaration<br />2. Heroes<br />3. Light On<br />4. Come Back to Me<br />5. Life on the Moon<br />6. Bar-ba-sol<br />7. Mr. Sensitive<br />8. Lie<br />9. I Did it for You<br />10. Avalanche<br />11. Permanent<br />12. A Daily AntheM<br />13. The Time Of My Life<br /><br />the lyrics: well written, relevant, and can be related to.<br /><br />the music: Rock for sure but not a heavy metal style. Its a gentle introduction for someone who normally doesn't listen to alot of guitar and drum based tunes. Some of the tunes could be easily be played on stations that specialize mainly in pop/top 40 music, and also most could be played on rock themed radio stations.<br /><br />My rating: 5 stars (the best).  It was worth the wait, and I'll be gifting the music to a few people that I know will enjoy rock music, and I am sure they would not be disappointed either.
B001GQACGE|2.0|Bottom line...this album is not worth the money. For someone who puts themselves on the highest pedestal possible, whether its her willing to outshine or overshine every female artist who dare to dominate the #1 spot (even her own group members), Beyonce really took a drink of confidence of splitting a 1 LP album into 2....NICE TRY!!!     There's nothing here that brings out the Beyonce she knows she's supposed to be. So its obvious that listening to this album is a fascade to the ear...with the exception of \\"Halo\\", where she pulls off a nice Leona Lewis challenge, and the actually BANGER on this entire package is \\"Scared Of Lonely\\". Those 2 songs are the reason for the 2 stars.     Once again.....It's not worth it. Unless you are a CD collector or you just wanna see some sexy pics (5 star photography lol....hmmmm), this isn't worth your money.
B001ACH4DS|5.0|Is it a solid, catchy album? Absolutely! Is it the best album that I have ever heard? No. That being said, it really is a very good album and worth the purchase. The more you listen, the better it gets. Another bonus, the tracks will appeal to a large variety of listeners from adult contemporary and pop fans to alternative and rock fans. It's a solid album, but I also think that it is just the tip of the iceberg and we have much more to look forward to from the talented David Cook.
0439882826|4.0|This book is something that you or your grandchildren will cherish forever. It is a keepsake.  The pop ups are so fascinating. Not only do you get the main pop up  but all the small explanatory pop ups in the corners.  I was thoroughly amazed at the work that went into this book. It is definitely worth the price.  I plan to purchase all the other pop up books by Matt Reinhart.
B001GQACGO|5.0|Wow I am not sure where Beyonce got all that energy from, but this double CD album is definitely hot !!<br />In fact I dont recall a single song I dont like.<br /><br />On the first CD you will find ballad type songs. If you expect now to get some sad, melancholic versioned songs you will be hard pressed. Whats special about these ballad versions is how confident and strong Beyonce is bringing them across. So also they are ballads they come across as very powerful.<br /><br />On the second CD she is blending pop, soul, gangsta rap, hip hop, dancefloor etc. and even some techno and trance elements very sensitive together.<br /><br />This album is definitely extremely well produced in any aspect !!<br />Obviously the songs are well produced but it doesnt stop there alone.<br />Beyonce and her producers have literally gone the extra miles to make this album stand out. The photos show her in all type of lingerie and fictional costumes and you can tell that the photographers did not avoid anything to make her standing out. If its not the costumes that grap your attention than its the light effects, the way the photo is taken or just plain Beyonce herself. The lyrics texts unfortunately are only included for the first CD, but hardcore Beyonce fans probably know them anyway ;-)<br /><br />Overall this double CD pack is an adrenalin patch you cant effort to miss !!<br /><br />A note for (Asin:B001F6QISQ) - The Japan import counterpart double CD:<br />I saw on Amazon that they also sell the import CD version  which claims to come with a Bonus DVD and a mini poster. It happens that I bought that very CD from Amazon in Japan and unless mine shipped without Amazons description is NOT right. But it does have the lyrics for BOTH CD's even in English and Japanese. An extra CD label was added on the outside box in a shiny metallic black to grap your attention on this one. The import version also has the two additonal songs \\"Save the Hero\\" and \\"Why dont you love me\\".
0142412147|5.0|I'm a sucker for romance any time of the year, but something about the holiday season makes me want to curl up in a nice blanket, drink hot chocolate, and read love stories.  LET IT SNOW is the perfect holiday read.<br /><br />Maureen Johnson starts things off with THE JUBILEE EXPRESS, in which Jubliee (no, not a stripper, but named for a piece in her mother's collection of the Flobie Santa Village) finds herself stranded on a train in Gracetown in a huge snowstorm.  A trip to the Waffle House introduces her to Stuart and friendship, or maybe something more, starts to form.<br /><br />In A CHEERTASTIC CHRISTMAS MIRACLE, author John Green hilariously describes the mission of three friends to get to the Waffle House where a group of cheerleaders are stranded and wanting to play Twister.<br /><br />And Lauren Myracle's THE PATRON SAINT OF PIGS shows that lost love can be found again with the help of Starbucks, angels, and even a pig.<br /><br />Each story stands well on its own, but it was nice to have a common thread throughout. I loved how the authors found ways to connect all three stories.  Characters you meet in the beginning show up later on, and places like Starbucks and the Waffle House are important to all three tales.  The only thing I didn't like was that they were all short stories - I could have kept reading about each of the characters!<br /><br />LET IT SNOW is a great, warm, fuzzy read for the holidays, so grab some hot chocolate and curl up because you won't want to stop reading until you're finished and happily sighing.<br /><br />Reviewed by:  Sarah Bean the Green Bean Teen Queen
B001GQACGO|5.0|After purchasing I Am...Sasha Fierce (Deluxe Edition) on day one and listening to it pretty much daily since, I am ready to write my review.  FIRST OF ALL I HAVE A WORD OF ADVICE TO OFFER TO DIE HARD BEYONCE FANS:  MANAGE YOUR EXPECTATIONS!  DO NOT BUY ANOTHER BEYONCE ALBUM EXPECTING THE WRITINGS ON THE WALL OR DANGEROUSLY IN LOVE 2, 3, 4, ETC!!!!!!!!  I sense a trend developing here.  This is no artist you will be able to put in a box as many of the earlier reviewers seem to want to do.  One thing I really admire about Beyonce is that she does not submit to the pressure to create the same project time and time again.  If you think of the sets artists of her genre put forth you often do not find something that is distinctly different from their previous releases.  Beyonce proves she is not afraid to weather criticism about the direction she decides to take.  To me that's true artistry.  She is making the music she wants to make and resists following trends.  Case in point.  Only 4 of the 16 tracks showcase production by what I would consider mainstream producers.  The others are unfamiliar names yet she still delivers a great project.  Even the usual almost guaranteed guest appearances were removed from the formula this time.  Instead of more collaborations with her husband you have songs like DISAPPEAR  and EGO where you imagine she is singing about him instead.  I think the naysayers of this album will be those who are resistant to change.  They will be upset that she didn't do what they expect her to do.  Well good for her.  There are plenty other artists recording who are willing to do just that.  This album is mature, artistic, and my prediction is that it will be award winning.  I think she has a wide range of cuts that will appeal to the masses and will expand her fan base.  She was aware that while she wanted to venture into other arenas she had to include tracks that her long time Destiny's Child fans could still appreciate.  I do not see any misteps with the album.  I enjoyed the gentle lyricism of the acoustic 'I AM' side and the confident attidude of the the 'SASHA FIERCE' side where you find the familiar heavy hitting Beyonce tracks.  One of the many lyrical highlights is the line in Satellites when she says, IF WE DON'T COMMUNICATE / WE'LL EXIST IN OUR OWN SPACE.  This line and this song in my view describes what happens in so many failed relationships.    The alto ego idea of this release seems to be a good idea to keep the fans excited about her. To me it seems that Beyonce is very aware of how fans can become complacent with artists over time.  If fans of old have an open mind about this album and don't try to compare it to her previous efforts I think they will come to see it as the work of art it is.
B001KO3FFW|5.0|It has been a long wait, but it is finally here.  I have several favorites on this CD.  Permanent, Declaration and Light On are the ones I listen to the most.  Of course, I cry every time I hear Permanent.  I think several of these songs could be singles and do well.      Overall, a very nice first shot by David.  This is one of those albums we won't get tired of any time soon.  Can't say that has happened too often with other singers/CD's.    You won't be sorry when you purchase David Cook's first CD!!
B001EOQWFI|4.0|The opening shot is of downtown New York City.  Only these aren't normal buildings but towers of blocks of trash.  WALL-E (voiced by beeps and Ben Burtt), our hero, is a glorified trash compactor who has made the mountains.  As we follow him across the vast landscape, we learn that he is the last of his kind and that he is indeed on earth.  Humans fled years ago because they bought into the commercialism of the Buy-n-Large stores that ruled the earth.  The resulting garbage overran the planet.<br /><br />But WALL-E is not a mindless robot.  He is curious and collects bits and pieces of things that are still intact.  At night, he takes these to his bunker where they are on display a la Ariel.  His only companions are a cockroach and a video tape of Hello Dolly.<br /><br />Into this world comes Eve (voiced by beeps and Elissa Knight).  Eve is another robot but much more high tech.  She is on a classified mission.  WALL-E immediately falls for her.  So much so, in fact, that when the spaceship returns to collect Eve, WALL-E tags along.  Suddenly, the two find themselves caught up in an adventure with the future of mankind at stake.  Can they save humanity?<br /><br />This isn't quite Pixar's best, but it is very good.  I mean, we've got robots who hardly speak as our main characters, yet we are completely rooting for them.  And even though the dialogue is limited, these robots have personality.  But it was the limited dialogue that got to me.  I got tire of long stretches where the only words we heard were Wall-E and EVE calling each others' names, especially during the climax.<br /><br />There are few characters here.  Frankly, that makes sense due to the extra effort it takes to develop character and story without dialogue.  And the story was a tad slow in spots, but it usually picked up about the time I was ready to move on.<br /><br />There are some many cute and funny moments in the film.  While most of these will appeal to the whole family, even those that kids wouldn't get are appropriate for all ages.<br /><br />The animation is spectacular throughout, but this is especially true once we leave earth.  There are some space shots that took my breath away.<br /><br />There are several morals lurking just below the surface of the film.  And you know what I appreciated abut them?  They lurked just below the surface.  Oh, they're hard to miss, but the story never stopped to lecture us.<br /><br />While slow at times, I had a smile on my face by the time the film was over.  And really, that's what it is all about..    The animation is spectacular throughout, but this is especially true once we leave earth.  There are some space shots that took my breath away.

B001ACH4DS|2.0|This is a pretty generic bunch of songs, don't even know what the genre would be other than what's called the flyover rock but not quite. At least Daughtry sounded much more pop and was therefore listenable, this is only good in some teeny parts. I am sure that part of the problem was the short amount of time the idol alumni had to release albums so that the labels can make money during x-mas rush.
B001ACH4DS|5.0|Yea, that's the voice we've been waiting to hear.  David's voice--raspy, melodic, like hot bourbon poured over honey--comes on like strong medicine, reminding us of exactly why he was the winner of Idol.  His voice stamps this music like a branding iron stamps leather, marking it with the power and charisma that never fails to impress every time he opens his mouth.  The magnetism of this man's voice is impressive, and is perhaps the greatest draw to this album.      Cook's inclination towards guitar driven, mid-western style, straight-ahead rock and roll has been given full rein here.  Guitars are loud, inclined towards power chords and crunchy distortion, and great solos.  If you are looking for innovation, then you will be a little disappointed--there is nothing new or groundbreaking in terms of the style of music or composition.  This is a rock album, get over it.  But let's be honest, you aren't coming to David for innovation.  You're here for the emotion, and in that you will be in no way disappointed.  His heart is on his sleeve and he isn't ashamed to let you know what is on his mind, and it is actually quite refreshing to find someone who knows that they simply want to rock and who has the ability to do it.      It appears that David was able to maintain at least some degree of control over the album, at least as judged by the writing credits:  something like 10 of the songs are of his own composition.  The fact that Cook is such an excellent writer is definitely going to be one of his strengths.    But how about the songs themselves?  Well, they are uniformly what one would have hoped after seeing David's best Idol performances.  Light On, of course, is great.  But other standout tracks include the first track, Declaration, I Did it For You, and Avalanche.      This album is exactly what the legions of fans that David made for himself on Idol have been hoping for.  But, more than this, he has remained true to the David we heard on Analogue Heart, rocking hard and fiercely unapologetic.  This is not a record that will change your life, but if you give it a chance, it will make you smile, make you sing along, and give you a great time.  Five stars not for being wildly inventive or boldly out of the box, but rather for being precisely what (I suspect) he wanted his music to be--a thoroughly enjoyable rock declaration.
B0015D3YX6|4.0|This album really defined Arthur Lee's career. Unfortunately, he never could artistically repeat the greatness he achieved on this album. What we have here is another re-issue of \\"Forever Changes\\" which essentially is the definitive Love album. From the Spanish influence on \\"Alone Again Or\\" to the baroque pop of \\"You Set The Scene\\" the album surmised the pop music of the time and made the album so much of its time and not timeless.<br /><br />The first disc in the 2-disc set contains once again the re-mastered version of the album, which is the same one as the regular re-issue that has been out for some time. Disc 2 has an alternative mix of the album that contains the count-ins and some different vocal takes. Some of the bonus tracks are identical to the single disc re-issue but there is more unissued stuff included.<br /><br />If you only have the vinyl version of this then this would be a great upgrade but if you have the previous single disc re-issue than stick with that as the extra material may be superfluous. But hey! It's your money.
0307269752|5.0|Stieg Larsson's \\"The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo\\", the first of a trilogy of thrillers, comes to our shores highly praised by all the lucky Europeans who have had their hands on it since 2007. It is a fantastic read because it is multi-layered, suspenseful and mysterious.<br /><br />The two main characters, Lisbeth Salander and Carl Mikael Blomkvist, circle around each other for the first half of the book, after which they actually meet and their stories converge. While the backbone mystery of the book involves the disappearance of a young Harriet Vanger, Larsson intertwines this story with multiple other themes including corporate corruption, journalistic ethics, violence against women and mass murder.<br /><br />When the book ends, the Vanger mysteries are solved satisfactorily, if gruesomely. And yet, I found myself securely hooked and waiting for the second book. The history and motivation of Lisbeth Salander remain so mysterious. She is on top of a short list of the most interesting characters of my recent fiction forays.<br /><br />If you like smart books, mysteries or suspense and can handle reading about terrible things like rape and murder, this book is more than worth it.
B001EO2UJK|5.0|When they started this re-mastering campaign over a year ago, it was frustrating that everybody had to wait until now to finally hear the Gabriel era Genesis in 5.1 surround sound. Well the wait is over.<br /><br />Just received it in the post yesterday and only had time to play \\"Foxtrot\\" in its new stereo mix and \\"Selling England By The Pound\\" in 5.1. As I am not a big fan of 5.1 mixes, I was surprised to hear how good \\"Dancing With The Moonlit Knight\\" sounded in surround. There has been a lot of remixing for \\"Trespass\\" to \\"Foxtrot\\" and the stereo mixes are much better than the original releases IMHO. According to Tony Banks, those albums were recording very quickly and there were really no opportunities to re-fine the final mix so it would appear that these new mixes are truer to what the band wanted and not what fans are used to. But then again its the artist's pergoative that prevails so there you are.<br />In addition, this is the first time that \\"Trespass\\" has been re-mastered in the U.S.; it was not part of the 1994 re-mastering campaign since that album was owned by MCA at the time and not Atlantic.<br /><br />Peter Gabriel also had some say in the 5.1 mixes and wanted the engineers to utilize the rear speakers for more instrumentation than reverb so the 5.1 mixes retain some of the integrity of the stereo mix but does take advantage of what was on the multi-track tape. So acoustic guitars are spread over the 2 front and rear speakers as well as keyboards and overdubs.<br /><br />The centerpiece of the collection is \\"The Lamb Lies Down On Broadway\\" in both a re-mixed stereo version over 2 cd's and the entire album in 5.1. I have not had a chance to get to this but it appears that this was what most Genesis fans have been waiting for. As an added attraction when you play the 5.1 the slides that were used for the live \\"LLDOB\\" are utilized so you can watch them on your TV screen as the music plays.<br /><br />So in summation, all of the studio albums are presented in both stereo re-mixes over 7 CD's and a bonus CD of unreleased material and in 5.1 mixes over 6 DVD in DTS or Dolby Surround (the SACD versions are only available as an import and the video portions are in PAL format). In addition, the video portions contain live concert films from the Banks/Collins/Gabriel/Hackett/Rutherford lineup so there is lot of material here in addition to the music. Its a great package plus they even use the old Charisma lable designs on the CD's and DVD's.<br /><br />If you still have not upgraded this is a perfect opportunity to do so.<br /><br />Update: Over the weekend, I have had time to sit back with a cold one and played \\"The Lamb Lies Down On Broadway\\" in its entirety in 5.1. The mix is stunning, surround speakers just not only carry various guitar and keyboard tracks but also various vocal lines where different characters are represented.  The added bonus of the slides used by Genesis are a fantastic bonus, the visuals also utilize 8mm film that was shot during a performance as well as the album artwork. Everything is done in time to the music to give a complete multi-media experience.<br /><br />Update #2: Actually I found a lot of the criticisms about the stereo CD's to be for the most part unfounded. Yes, the albums do sound a little different but it is not drastic as some other people have commented or lets just say it is not like those crappy ZZ Top cd's that were released over a decade ago. Keep in mind that the audience for this Box Set are real fans of Genesis, especially those of the Peter Gabriel era. If you looking for the vocal stylings of Phil Collins than get the first 2 Box Sets. Also, this very same audience also consists of self-proclaimed audiophiles who will throw around technical terms like \\"compression\\", \\"EQ\\", and \\"brickwalling\\", well all I can say is that as of 12/1/2008 there are way more \\"5\\" star ratings then \\"1\\" star ratings. Let your own ears be the judge, if you don't like it return it.<br /><br />Update #3<br />Please drop it with \\"The Loudness Wars\\" video. Sorry, but I do not consider YouTube to be the end all and be all of quality information (do a search on Romeo Rose a get a history of the blues ). This video basically consists of a self-proclaimed expert with a computer and software playing a bit from a Paul McCartney track and minipulating it using HIS SOFTWARE. Plus, there is no mention of any credentials or work the guy has done so why should his word be taken as gospel?<br /><br />YouTube is not a research tool, its entertainment.I do not consider YouTube to be the end all and be all of quality information (do a search on Romeo Rose a get a history of the blues ).

0446579939|5.0|I absolutely love every book that Nicholas Sparks has ever written.  Although I cannot say this is his best because I love them all the same.  I will be reading this book over and over!!!  You can't go wrong with a Nicholas Sparks Novel.
B001ACH4DS|5.0|Being an American Idol winner brings with it the almost unattainable expectation of releasing a \\"perfect\\" record the first time out... what fourth season victor Carrie Underwood achieved would almost have to be considered a minor miracle.  A fourth or fifth place finisher might actually have an advantage (case in point...Chris Daughtry)...more time, less pressure.   The super-intelligent, mature-for-his-age David Cook seems to be a better bet than most former winners...with musical direction not being an issue and plenty of writing and recording experience under his belt.    The one thing I admired most about Cook on AI was his ability to take a song, regardless of genre or how old it was, and turn it into something modern and original.  He's also proved he has the voice to match his creativity.  Even though David had to fulfill his duties and go on the Idol tour, he still managed to write or co-write almost the entire album, of which the majority was recorded while he was away.  Grammy-winning producer Rob Cavallo took the reins and did an excellent job of crafting a very natural-sounding rock record, without feeling the need to \\"spice it up\\" with synthetic instrumentation & over-the-top special effects.    It's easy to hear how David's favorite bands, like Our Lady Peace and Collective Soul, have influenced his songwriting.  There are songs here that reach both ends of the rock spectrum, from the almost-heavy-metal \\"Bar-ba-sol\\", to the stripped-down piano-based dirge \\"Permanent\\".  Most of the rest of the songs are slight variations of a basic rock formula...sparse instrumentation at the beginning of the song with David singing in his lower register, a mid-tempo, right-on-the-beat, plodding bass line that drives the song to its heightened chorus section, where David sings at full throttle, backed by powerful guitars with your standard rock chord progressions...in other words, nothing ground-breaking and slightly cliche'...but does that mean the songs aren't that good?  Absolutely not!!  While these are mainstream radio rock songs, and I was hoping for something so unique and original it would blow me away, I must say I haven't heard the \\"norm\\" done this well in a very long time.      As I suspect there will be many comparisons to groups like Daughtry and Nickelback, IMO David betters both in terms of performance and delivery.  As you go down the track list, it appears there may be only a couple of tunes that won't make the cut as a potential radio single.    One final note about a song that I do believe breaks new ground.  The aforementioned \\"Permanent\\"...a song for his brother Adam who is battling cancer... that one hits me in the gut and in the heart...not just because I too am in a similar fight, but because this is a song sung with such amazing passion...I feel that so deeply in his voice and delivery every time I hear it; it's truly a song to make a grown man cry.    I think this album will do the same for millions more.  It's melodic and catchy, with great lyrics and depth, and comes from a special man in terms of both talent and personality...he'll never be able to hide his smile behind that kind of album cover.    I'm \\"permanent\\"-ly attached to this one... A++
B001CD6FKS|3.0|I enjoyed this movie very much, the effects and action scenes were amazing and I think the wachowski's did an amazing job with the source material. The story was a bit cliched and shallow, but hey, the cartoon wasnt known for having deep and thoughtprovoking storylines. It is what it is, if your a fan of speed racer or of action filled family flicks, you'll thouroughly enjoy it, just dont expect a pixar film, lol.
B001KQKC0Q|3.0|Nickelback's new album brings with it the first major sonic change since signing with EMI and Roadrunner Records (with the possible exception of \\"The State\\"), largely due to influential producer \\"Mutt\\" Lange coming out of his \\"rock-music-scene retirement\\" of 8 years and putting his two-cent's worth (and those are two HUGE pennies) in on the record.    Well known for his uncanny ability to transform a stagnant band or artist into an overnight success, Lange helped save bands like Foreigner and Heart...not to mention what he did for AC/DC and Def Leppard.    While Nickelback frontman Chad Kroeger still co-produced on Dark Horse, you knew things would change because with Lange, there is only one right way to do things.  Obviously, with the huge success the band has had under Kroeger's leadership and production, especially with 2005's \\"All The Right Reasons\\" still going strong after selling millions, this wasn't a \\"save\\" situation...just a great opportunity for Kroeger and company to work with a legend.    The result is sort of a \\"Nickelback meets the 80's\\" record, and the best way to describe the sound is BIG, FAT and THICK...with little dynamic range...and guitars and drums being priorities.  If you're a fan of 80's hard rock in the vein of AC/DC and Def Leppard, read no furthur...you'll love this album.    However, if you're like me and prefer the more natural sound of Kroeger's previous efforts, you may have an issue or two with this record.  This sounds a little too manufactured and processed for my tastes.  Lange's influence is all over this album, including how the songs themselves come across.  He's definitely made this into an arena rock record filled with hard rock/heavy-metal type anthems...as a whole it sounds like one major jam session with all dials on ten (except for some of the always-included, mid-tempo Adult Contemporary ballads).     Multi-layered background vocal chants and special effects are everywhere, and my biggest beef is with the drum sounds...Lange's trademark electronic-hybrid snare drum sounds are way over-the-top for me.  If I wished to hear this type of production today, I'd rather dust off my old Def Leppard and AC/DC tapes and listen to those...I don't need to hear it on a 2008 Nickelback record.    That being said, some of the songs aren't half-bad...\\"Dark Horse\\" gets off to a fast start with the incessantly infectious \\"Something In Your Mouth\\"...based on a repeated, extremely catchy guitar riff that once in your head, is there to stay.  \\"Gotta Be Somebody\\" is one of Nickelback's best mid-tempo AC tunes in a while, and \\"I'd Come For You\\" is similar, though slower-paced.  Interestingly, \\"Mutt\\" Lange's production style doesn't seem to hurt the power ballads...they may have actually benefited from the change.    But when the heavy, straight-forward rock songs come back in, the over-production ruins it for me...on \\"Next Go Round\\", the transducer vocal processor makes Chad sound as if he's singing through a cardboard paper-towel roll tube connected to a distortion pedal... at least the chorus is hot and catchy.  The top half of the lineup is strongest, and after another solid power ballad \\"Never Be Alone\\", \\"Dark Horse\\" begins to fade down the stretch in terms of song quality, and limps to the closer, \\"This Afternoon\\".  This country-flavored tune doesn't seem to fit with the rest of the collection, and it has a chorus that sounds like it was copied and pasted from a Def Leppard album.    All in all, the record has its moments, and the average listener won't be bothered by the loss of a natural, \\"real\\"-sounding character, and may actually come away quite impressed by the stacked, multiple-overdubbed, super-polished production.    I think Nickelback was doing just fine under Kroeger's direction, and it begs the question, \\"Why fix what ain't broke?\\"  For me, the new sound leaves a lot to be desired, and in the end, \\"Dark Horse\\" fails to finish.

I love when an album doesn't sound the same song to song.  Great album.  If your a Nickelback fan a must buy.  New to Nickelback great place to start.    Can't wait to see them on tour.    I say Nickel you say -- their back!!!!!!!!!!
B001GZ6QEC|5.0|Can anyone please explain what: \\"Format: AC-3\\" means for this Dark Knight DVD?  I looked up blu ray dvd region codes and it clearly stated what regions A1, B2 & C3 formats were for, but I don't understand what AC-3 means.<br /><br />I wanted to get this DVD for my husband for X-mas, as he loves, loves, loves this movie.  We currently have a region 2 blu ray DVD player for the next 6 months while we are in Europe.  Then will have to sell it (due to different voltage from USA) and purchasing a region 1 blu ray dvd player in the USA. I would like to be able to purchase blu ray DVD's that are for both regions if possible, so we can at least take the DVD's with us back to the US.  Any information would be appreciated.  Thanks!
B001GQACGO|5.0|Leave it to Beyonce to take risks because that is exactly what she did on this album and what a great result.    With \\"I Am...\\" she shows you the true artistry that she possess. From songs like the hit single \\"If I Were A Boy\\" to the next potential \\"Halo\\", she definitely caters to the masses. But on song like \\"Ave Maria\\", \\"Satellites\\", and \\"Broken-Hearted Girl\\" she digs deep down and professes her love for someone special past and present. Anyone can relate to these songs.    On \\"Sasha Fierce\\" she is fierce indeed! With club-ready hits like \\"Radio\\" and \\"Diva\\" we are sure to hear these songs being bumped in the club and they are sure to get you moving. While \\"I Am...\\" is more personal we get the true diva that is Beyonce represents here. She definitely does herself justice and also her fans.    5 Stars all the way...Beyonce just keeps getting better and better!
B001GQACGO|3.0|I Am... (Disc 1): Beyoncé truly took some risks on this disc... when compared to her past work. However, in comparison to the stuff that plagues the radio these days, it is anything but groundbreaking or daring in most instances. Several of these tracks sound like all the other over-produced, synth-driven, melodramatic tracks out there (see: three-fourths of Jennifer Hudson's debut and pretty much all of Leona Lewis' album). Still, this set of pop/rock ballads is relatively enjoyable--or even incredible--all the way through and it showcases her vocal prowess, which is often overlooked or buried under the glitz and glam of the video world. \\"Halo\\" soars and showcases her wide range. The subtly addictive hook of \\"Disappear\\" is elegant and perfectly matches the guitar-laced production. \\"Broken-Hearted Girl\\" is very emotional. It begins as a piano-and-vocal ballad, and then transcends into a minimalist beat. (I'm a sucker for that kind of thing). The wandering melody of \\"Ave Maria\\" is beautiful, even if the little riff borrowed from the traditional of the same name is a tad bit awkward. \\"If I Were A Boy\\" is a guilty pleasure of mine, and probably yours, too. \\"Satellites\\" is the only absolutely disposable track. Overall, this is a nice disc, albeit a bit unoriginal. / The crescendos of \\"Smash Into You\\" are nice, but whoever wrote the lyrics is trying too hard. \\"That's Why You're Beautiful\\" is almost as bad as \\"Satellites.\\" The added tracks on this deluxe edition unfortunately detract from the enjoyment of the standard edition's first disc.    Sasha Fierce (Disc 2): This disc contains tracks that are much more similar to her work on B'Day, which I thought was a superb album. It pales in comparison to her sophomore album--especially since these tracks lack the complex harmonies of said LP, but it still is packed with catchy and upbeat songs. She also takes a few chances here, but again, they have already been done. \\"Radio\\" and \\"Sweet Dreams\\" (also known as \\"Beautiful Nightmare\\" when it was leaked earlier this year) are both delicious slices of grandiose Euro-pop that is all over the airwaves these days. It is different enough to actually work, though, and Beyoncé's vocal performances are truly inspired and full with passion. \\"Diva\\" is a cocky female response to Lil' Wayne's hit \\"A Milli.\\" It will surely be hit in the clubs, but the production is just too similar. \\"Single Ladies (Put A Ring On It)\\" is very addictive and has great contrasts and harmonies; however, it does get a bit repetitive. Beyoncé has some great vocal flourishes on \\"Video Phone,\\" but the crunk-inspired track is just plain silly. We're talking about present-day R. Kelly type of silly. / \\"Hello\\" and \\"Ego\\" are two of the best tracks of Beyoncé's career, so I can't imagine why they were restricted to the deluxe version. But one thing's for certain: they brighten up this disc. \\"Hello\\" is a heartfelt love mid-tempo with vocals full of desperation. The equally funky and soulful \\"Ego\\" is full of swagger and confidence. The chorus is the cherry on the top. After a whole album with tracks that are borderline over-produced, this simple and clean track is a breath of fresh air and it is most certainly the best track off either of the discs. After these two tracks, the bland \\"Scared of Lonely\\" simply goes in one ear and out of the other.     Overall: I commend Beyoncé for coming with something new this time around. Unfortunately, many of the songs are not so original and almost religiously follow the synth-heavy ballads and Euro-pop dance tracks that are all over the mainstream at the moment. Quite a few of the songs suffer from over-production that will probably sound a bit absurd in a few years after all these aforementioned trends come and pass. Still, that is not to say this is not a good album. It is a bit uneven, with a few lame tracks (i.e. \\"Satellites,\\" \\"Video Phone,\\"). The deluxe edition adds three not-so-special tracks (\\"Smash,\\" \\"Beautiful,\\" \\"Lonely\\") and two truly exceptional ones (\\"Hello\\" and especially \\"Ego.\\") If you don't mind spending the extra few bucks, it's probably better to buy this edition than the standard 11-track edition. Overall, I Am Sasha Fierce is decent and enjoyable. It is by no means Beyoncé's crowning achievement, but it still works.
B001GQACGO|5.0|Each time Beyonce drops an album it's a good one. 'I Am...Sasha Fierce' is FIERCE! Disc 1 is hot and disc 2 is hotter! Each song has equal quality of lovability. Beyonce is doing her thing!! Get it girl!

0316017922|4.0|Malcolm Gladwell sets out to show in Outliers that culturally we have some misconceptions about the road to success, and that by looking at how our meritocracy really works we can do our best to both give people a fair playing field and also stop pointlessly thwarting the futures of people whose chances are lowered for purely arbitrary reasons.<br /><br />Gladwell is at his best attacking these kinds of arbitrary but systematic discrimination. When schools set a cut-off age for each grade, the oldest kids end up labeled the most talented while the younger ones, who are really just less mature and younger, are left behind. Since more teaching and hard work compound innate talents, those older kids just end up getting better and better while the young ones stay the same. This sort of problem is pointless and easily remedied, as is, for example, the unnecessarily long summer vacation enjoyed by American students.<br /><br />The way teaching and hard work can compound individual merit is critical to each story in Outliers. Geniuses, experts, and star players are naturally talented--they really do have to be. But they also have to work hard (10,000 hours of practice is the magic number in pretty much any field) and get lucky. Genius with no opportunity won't, unfortunately, amount to much.<br /><br />While some opportunities are given and taken away through purely bureaucratic means, like the age cut-offs for schools and sports teams, others are more complicated. Some cultures instill a strong work ethic, some cultures instill a certain respect to authority. These are things that can deeply affect the choices people make and how they will lead either to compounded merit and opportunity or stagnation. Here it becomes more difficult to give easy prescriptions.<br /><br />In general, Gladwell finds good anecdotes to illustrate larger points that seem valid and important. He's willing to explore cultural influences on success and failure despite the fear of being accused of stereotyping, and I think in this particular case it's very valuable. I'm not an expert in most of the areas of research, so it's somewhat hard for me to evaluate whether all the studies are methodologically sound and cited without distortion as to meaning. But the only claim I took issue with was one made toward the end of the book about why Chinese students are so good at math--the rest of the points seemed solid.s particular case it's very valuable.

B00003CX8Y|5.0|One of the best Disney movies, Beauty and the Beast (based on the fairytale of the same name) came during the golden years of the 90s where Disney could do no wrong. Along with the classic movie, you can watch the special edition (with a whole new animated song sequence thrown in almost seamlessly) or the in-progress edition which is self explanatory. My favorite extras were the character development sketches. It was amazing to see how much characters like the Beast, Gaston and LaFoo evolved from their original incarnations!
1433502445|5.0|I really like the layout and language used for this study Bible.  Still a big fan of the NASB translation, but I am learning to enjoy the ESV.
B001KVZ6BG|4.0|The story is original and the storytelling unique, especially when compared to Hollywood movies. The acting is marvelous from the entire cast, with the children actors overshadowing the adults who play their respective older characters. The movie is very emotional and heartfelt. The only problem with the movie is that the ending is too hopeful, too cheerful, too optimistic.
0307269752|2.0|Many of the people who reviewed this book have given a basic description of the plot, which is complex but reasonably easy to follow. What few people have addressed however, is the completely over-the-top climax and ending, which pretty much negates the intriguing story that came before.<br /><br />This reminds me in some ways of another very well-reviewed book, \\"The Good Thief.\\" That's another book that was beautifully written with fascinating characters that went badly out of control towards the end, as if the author just wanted to finish writing and didn't care about the investment of time and energy on the readers' part. As long as she could get to the words \\"The End,\\" maintaining the story's integrity just didn't matter past a certain point.<br /><br />In much the same way, the last quarter of \\"The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo,\\" including the climax, ended up being ridiculous and completely over-the-top. Believing for hundreds of pages that I was in the hands of a master storyteller I feel cheated, both by the author and by the reviewers in major publications who fell all over themselves praising this book.
B000V86OKG|4.0|Dexter's second season had a tough act to follow after the first season. But this Dexter season had new ups and downs from the funny to the sinister side of Dexter. Great 2nd season.
B001GQACGO|4.0|Even at the first pass, I can honestly say that I so much can appreciate the softer, more conservative side of her work on this project.  On the slower cuts, she seems to vocalize differently than is her norm.  The album would have been better if all the slower were on one CD and the up-beat, energetic (alter-ego) tunes were on a separate disc.  Mine (downloaded from ITunes) didn't seem to go that way.  I appreciate getting 20 songs (although two of them were dups) and somehow don't feel cheated.  I like at least 75 percent of the songs in this collection, but --for me-- honestly, I have to listen more than once (usually 3 to 4 times) before I start getting a real appreciation or liking for the songs and they begin to break in.  I'd easily give this 4 stars, and I am no Beyonce fanatic or serious fan, and I don't think there's any jinx going on here either, although -- I could be wrong.  Have been about once or twice before.  :)
B0015AARJI|5.0|If you've used a Sony Playstation at any point over the last 10 or so years you pretty much know what to expect with the Dualshock 3. The size, shape and layout of the DS3 is almost identical to the original Dualshock controller that was released for the Playstation 1. Chances are if you liked using any of the previous Sony brand controllers you'll also enjoy using the Dualshock 3. Similarly, if any of the previous Dualshock controllers weren't quite right for you then you'll probably dislike the DS3.<br /><br />Slight changes have been made to the shoulder buttons and the addition of a'PS' button allows for quick start-up and shutdown of the PS3 as well as access to the PS3 X-Cross Media Bar.<br /><br />The L2 & R2 shoulder buttons are now less 'button' and more 'trigger'. Personally I'm mixed on the new layout. The trigger design works great in certain games such as racing games; but can be less than perfect for platforming or action games.<br /><br />The DS3 features the exact same motion sensitivity featured in the Sony SIXAXIS controller for the PS3. The major addition of the DS3 being the rumble feature. In using the DS3 for approximately 6 months it has become my controller of choice. Simply put the DS3 offers a level of immersion into games that the SIXAXIS cannot offer. The actual amount of rumble varies from game to game and many games even offer the ability to adjust the rumble feedback.<br /><br />Also improved over the SIXAXIS is the feel of the DS3 controller. Because of the added weight afforded by the rumble mechanism the DS3 feels heavier and more appropriate than the lightweight SIXAXIS.<br /><br />Because the DS3 is wireless it relies on a built-in battery to power the controller. Battery life is comparable to that afforded by the SIXAXIS which is approximately 8-10 hours. In my experience charging the DS3 to a full charge takes about 30 minutes to 1 hour.<br /><br />The DS3 relies on Blutooth technology to power the wireless feature. Range is excellent and advertised to be about 30ft. Suffice to say that I've never experienced a problem with regards to wireless range.<br /><br />All told the DS3 is the premier Playstation controller. Well built and sturdy the controller will last through many gaming sessions. I highly recommend the DS3 to any gamer.fice to say that I've never experienced a problem with regards to wireless range.     All told the DS3 is the premier Playstation controller.

As you may know (oh, you dont)?  Pink and Corey couldnt make it work and got divorced.Now a lot of you feel that if a woman is divorce she cant remarry because it is sin (as in the Bible)  Well, if thats so Pink and i want you to talk to the hand or better yet It's just you and your hand tonight (Pink's way of saying talk to teh hand)!  Now for songs, people.  The songs are great.  So What makes you want to get out on the dance floor and be obnoxious and pump your fist!! Soberi great too!  there are some slower numbers that will make you cry and really feel for Alecia and her pain.  If only Sheryl Crow coulda come up with this after breakup with lance!!!  And it ends with throwing glitter in the air!  A beautiful message!  it makes you want to get a handfull of glitter and just throw it!!  So all you haters can just go away cause Alecia is back and here to stay!!!  And if Britney's Circus can pull it off, thenwe have three great cds this year by three talented ladies!!!

B001KO3FFW|5.0|All the tracks are really well done. The songs fit his vocal talent. Although David could really sing the phonebook and it would be good. I'm gald to see that no one tried to put together a bunch of crossover songs (see Taylor Hicks). Maybe the Idol producers finally got it. Declaration,Light On,Avalanche and Daily Anthem were worth the wait.  Again Well Done
B0014DZ2VO|4.0|\\"Quantum of Solace\\" could have been more aptly titled \\"Quantum of Speed.\\" The film is literally one chase scene after another. Of course, you have the inevitable car chase, but you also have boat and on foot.     Storyline is surprisingly thin particularly since Paul Haggis (Crash, Due South) was the author, but the characterization within was excellent.  Essentially, Bond (Daniel Craig) is after an organization that no one even knew existed which has managed to penetrate MI-5 deep enough to have gotten one of their men placed as the venerable M's bodyguard.      Bond, of course, has his own agenda.  He's also seeking vengeance for the death of girlfriend, Vesper.  The two missions segue together for him and often tend to have others wondering what he's really after.    Naturally, people who come up against him die.  He's only defending himself, but it gets annoying when his superiors are trying to get information about this mystical group and their purpose.      While I enjoyed \\"Quantum of Solace,\\" I think it's regrettable that it's one of the first Bonds that doesn't stand alone.  It's too dependent on knowledge of \\"Casino Royale.\\"     One aspect of \\"Quantum\\" I really enjoyed was the exploration of the relationship between Bond and his boss, M. At one point, someone asks Bond if the woman is his mother.  \\"She thinks she is,\\" is his answer.       \\"Casino Royale\\" marked the first Daniel Craig as James Bond film.  Craig's rougher demeanor and appearance was a return to more of what I read in the Ian Fleming novels, rather than the smoother persona that actors like Pierce Brosnan and Sean Connery portrayed. I miss the gadgets and not once did Craig say, \\"Bond, James Bond.\\" But, it's a new day and as an action film junkie, I'm ready to roll with it--in cars, planes, busses, or even on foot.

B001GZ6QC4|2.0|The ruination of the Batman mythos continues. Some examples:    1. The heroine never dies even though she didn't belong in the first place.    2. Batman doesn't endanger innocent bystanders as in the high speed chase with so much destruction.     3. The Joker never ever fooled Batman pyschologically.    Batman is now just another vigilante. The movie is far too long, with too much violence. Cell phone networks are incapable of doing what Batman had it do. Whatever happened to his detective skills to figure things out or weren't writers smart enough to figure something out?     There probably isn't enough of the mythos left to sustain the franchise without looking like an empty shell. And there were so many good Batman stories left to tell.

Secondly, why would you want someone to make the same record again and again.

While I would say this is a good book for transitioning your son from early chapter books to \\"regular\\" chapter books, like I am trying to do with my son, I would like to point out that this book is SCARY.  His father dies. His mother is already dead.  His uncle then dies -- via drowning.  He is orphaned.  He is bullied and chased.  He does not have enough to eat.  No one loves this poor, sad child.  He doesn't have a dime and never gets fresh air while living in the walls of a train station.  Wonderful?  Well written, maybe.  But SCARY.  I advise caution for younger and more sensitive readers.
B001GQACGE|4.0|i gave it four instead of five because the album is NOT complete, the last five amazing songs complete the album, especially the last three songs in the \\"sasha fierce\\" section, those songs were really needed, i do not understand why they bothered releasing this version. the delux could have been the ONLY one released.

B001ACH4DS|5.0|This album completely blows me away.  Cook's vocal ability, combined with his genious songwriting (and great collaborators) make this album incredible and unforgettable.  There is something for everyone on this record; Whether it's heavy rock (Barbasol), soaring ballads (Permanent), or radio-friendly pop/rock tunes (Light On, Heroes, Mr Sensitive, etc), Cook delivers 110% on his self titled debut.
B0000844I8|5.0|Get the movie and then buy every season of Stargate SG-1.  It's worth it!
B001GQACGO|2.0|I don't have a lot of good to say for this album. \\"I Am...Sasha Fierce\\" appears to be an ambitious creative undertaking by the undeniably talented Beyonce, and in many ways it is. But it's that very ambition that nearly destroys this project.<br /><br />From the first single off the album \\"If I Were a Boy\\" you get a distinct feeling that Beyonce is trying very hard to branch out into different territory. The song is quite understated for her, although her signature shatter every piece of glass within a 3 mile radius pipes do start in during the somewhat over-dramatic chorus. Still, it's a nice song and accessible enough.<br />The next track on the album is \\"Halo\\" which is one of the stronger songs on the whole album. It has a big sound and it really compliments Beyonce's style without sounding too much like her previous work. Unfortunately after that things start to go downhill. \\"Disappear\\" sounds interesting for the first 10 seconds, but then the generic drum machines kick in and the rest of the song is a slow, bland mess. \\"Broken-Hearted Girl\\" is almost indistinguishable from the track before it, and it's just as dull. \\"Ave Marie\\" has beautiful vocals and is a very nice song, but it's not something most people will listen to constantly. \\"Satellites\\" almost reminds me of some type of trance music. It's very understated, but it's also nearly lifeless. Just try staying awake listening to that over and over again.<br /><br />Then comes disc 2, \\"Sasha Fierce\\". I expected this disc to really pick things up after a first disc full of disappointing slow songs that could barely even be deemed ballads. After all, Sasha Fierce is supposed to be the high-energy side of Beyonce that we're all familiar with from her \\"B'Day\\" album. Well, it turns out that this time around \\"Sasha Fierce\\" barely even has a pulse. Things kick off with \\"Single Ladies\\" which sounds like a \\"B'Day\\" leftover, (that's actually a good thing), and it really is what we expect from Ms. Fierce. But that turns out to be the only track that has anywhere near that much ferocity. Next is \\"Radio\\" which is a busy number, but still falls short somehow. I suppose it could go over well in a club with a bunch of flashing lights, but it can be quite noisy to listen to by oneself.<br />Next is \\"Diva\\" which just sounds like a female knockoff of Lil'Wayne's \\"A Milli\\". It's very street and pompous and will probably annoy anyone who isn't a fan of that generic hip-hop sound.<br />\\"Sweet Dreams\\" is a respectable track if for no other reason than that it's obviously different, but for some reason it's yet another song I can't bring myself to listen more than a few times. Honestly, it doesn't sound like it really fits in with the rest of the songs anyway.<br />The next track \\"Video Phone\\" is just too street for me. The production is uninspired and it's lacking energy just like the rest of \\"Sasha Fierce\\". And it's about making video phone porn. Great.<br />If you want the REAL Sasha Fierce you'll have to go listen to \\"B'Day\\" because this is honestly the ghettofied version of Beyonce in many respects. And it doesn't suit her well. Perhaps we have her new husband to thank for that.<br /><br />I'd say if you have to buy this album then get the Deluxe version. The extra tracks \\"Ego\\", \\"Scared of Lonely\\", \\"Hello\\", \\"Smash Into You\\", and \\"That's Why You're Beautiful\\" are almost all superior to anything on the standard edition. I believe Beyonce knows this which is why she's releasing \\"Ego\\" as her next single.<br /><br />I have to say that overall I feel the first disc from \\"I Am...\\" will bore many listeners, and the second disc will leave them wondering if Sasha Fierce is the woman they've seen strutting on stage to tracks like \\"Crazy In Love\\" and \\"Ring the Alarm\\" or a diva looking for street cred like on tracks \\"Diva\\" and \\"Video Phone\\". I'll give Beyonce props for trying something different with the first disc, but it's really not enough. Both discs are a mish-mash of sounds that don't gel together well and make it strikingly obvious that Beyonce was experimenting in the studio. Problem is, most of those experiments went awry, and those that didn't seem too safe and boring.<br /><br />I say download:<br />Ego<br />Scared of Lonely<br />Halo<br />If I Were a Boy<br />Single Ladies<br />Hello<br />Ave Marie<br /><br />None of those tracks are outstanding, but at least they're a cut above the rest of the mess.<br /><br />A final note: I have NO clue why Beyonce decided to split this work into two disc. It was totally pointless, especially for the standard edition which only gives you 6 songs on one disc and 5 on the other. But even with the two standard discs conjoined, the extra tracks from the deluxe edition added, and the bonus tracks from Japan added as well, every song would fit on ONE disc with room to spare. The two disc thing proves to be little more than an annoyance and I hope Beyonce won't do it again. I do feel that the whole thing is about record sales more than anything else.eyonce was experimenting in the studio.

B001GQACGO|4.0|This c.d. is really nice.  Unlike her last c.d. I have to listen to it over and over to really enjoy it.  I love her first song \\"If I were a boy\\".  To me her B'Day c.d. was better.  I love Beyonce` and she has a message in this c.d. just like she has in all of her c.d.'s.
1416562591|3.0|This is a good and easy reading. It truely depicts the lives of poor Indian people whose lives are not touched by the last decade's economic boom. Do not expect any literary height of English in this novel. It's rather low-register english used by the writer.
0684857219|5.0|This book has everything.  To include an inspirational history of bodybuilding.  Reading about the competitions and Arnold's rise in the bodybuilding world just gets you PUMPED to work out harder.  The exercises are documented and easy to read.  And the creditials of the author say it all.
B001F290E4|3.0|Seal has set himself up with a tough task with this album, which will leave fans wishing it was more.  I for one, expected a lot more.  The track listing is good, but not killer.  And at first listen, SOUL doesn't quite channel the soul of the originals - each of which is pretty much a classic and hard to better.  I liked \\"I Can't Stand the Rain\\" but nothing else quite leaps out.  The rest of the album will probably work for a new generation unfamiliar with soul classics but not for the people who already know the songs.  I kept thinking while listening, that Simply Red has the edge up in this department.<br /><br />The problem seems to be that Seal ironically, has lost his soul.  He doesn't sound as hungry as the singers that made these songs.  Terrible but true.  He needs to get back to where he came from.  The voice is there but something is missing.  Maybe David Foster WAS the wrong choice indeed.  But maybe it's not all Foster's fault.<br /><br />Covers have always been a tough call unless you're Rod Stewart doing jazz standards.  Other artists from Barry Manilow to Michael Bolton have tried and had mixed results.  Seal joins that bunch.  Here's looking to his next move!
0375756825|4.0|Treasure Island / 0-375-75682-5<br /><br />There's been so many movies based on \\"Treasure Island\\" that it's almost impossible not to be somewhat familiar with the story. Stevenson shines here, managing to carefully craft a story for children that will also appeal to adults.<br /><br />The boy hero of the story is respected enough to be included in the plans and tribulations of the adults on board, but is not kowtowed to the point of offending adult sensibilities. The pirates are realistically rendered, but not to the point where real children would likely be frightened - the violence here is fantastical only, of the sort that was seen so vividly in other classics, such as \\"Peter Pan\\". Indeed, I am tempted to categorize \\"Treasure Island\\" as a children's classic, alongside such classics as Barrie's work, but I feel that the slightly dated format and feel of this particular classic might present a barrier to young children. Perhaps this is best read as an adult's guilty pleasure, or as a group reading choice, with the adult explaining the more esoteric references and sea-faring minutia.<br /><br />~ Ana Mardoll

0673999963|5.0|The Complete Works of Shakespeare / 0-673-99996-3<br /><br />Every play, every sonnet, every scribble is here - and much more. This volume includes useful background on the theater, politics, morality, and social mores of the day. The level of detail here is absolutely stunning; the footnotes are numerous and incredibly helpful, especially to 'translate' obscure sayings or particularly unusual English usage. Each play is prefaced with an introduction containing the complete 'cliffs notes' of the play, providing useful insight into character motivation and development. I highly recommend this volume, both for Shakespeare enthusiasts and for students just wishing for enough information that they can passably demonstrate familiarity with the Bard.<br /><br />~ Ana Mardoll
1416562605|5.0|This book was simply amazing. Adiga put together a fascinating portrait of a city, some beautiful dark comedy, but what absolutely made me unable to put down this book was the voice of the main character.    This is a \\"told\\" story. In a letter to a Chinese official coming to visit Bangalore, Balram unfolds the story of his life, and it is just utterly perfect. I generally don't prefer this kind of story-telling, but Aravind Adiga did it without a single misstep, and the book reads so smoothly. This book was dark, it was funny, it addressed both great truths and small lies, and it offered the reader a peek at a different world. I can't recommend this book enough.
0156034026|4.0|I found this book to be much more enjoyable than I thought it would be. The concept was a little difficult at first for me to grasp: a young man, Changez, imposes himself upon an American in a Pakistani cafe, and spends the afternoon/evening in a conversation in which he speaks of how his life has come full circle, from Pakistan to America and back.    Although most seem to pick up hate against the US, I concentrated more on Changez's story and tried to place myself in his shoes. It was interesting to see how he perceived events in his life and he chose to interpret those events in his surroundings. This book gave me much to think on and about.    While I feel the book was good, I think the writing could be improved on, so the reason I gave it 4 stars and not 5. I enjoyed the book, but it's not something a lot of people can read easily.
B001BKG9SK|3.0|I'd love to say that this CD/DVD is great, but I can only really go halfway. That's because roughly half of the material on it is from David's latest studio release \\"On An Island\\", which, to me, is the musical equivalent of a good sleeping pill. The Pink Floyd material, such as \\"Astronomy Domine\\", \\"Fat Old Sun\\", \\"Echoes\\", and \\"A Great Day For Freedom\\", are wonderful, however, the selections from \\"On An Island\\", are incredibly BORING. It's as simple as that.
B001GQACGO|2.0|I love Beyonce, but what is going on with this Album B? I feel like she took hot beats mixed it with lyrics that have no Substance! I'm disappointed. There are only a couple of songs-4 or 5 that I like and two of them are already singles. My main critique is the lack of substance with the lyrics. Where's the B that wrote Dangerously in love and Me, Myself, and I? I'm not sure where she's went, and out of the 70 songs she has recorded for this album, I'm sure these cannot be the best 9 or 10. I hope she turns back into more of a singer rather than simply an entertainer / performer with vocals. We want substance B! *nice beats though*
B001ACH4DS|5.0|Anyone who has done their homework knows that David has been writing his own songs and performing for about 10 years.  His songwriting from a very early age (i.e. Somber from his Axium days) has been amazing.  You really see it in the lyrics of the songs he co-wrote or wrote on this album.  They just have a level of sophistication, emotional depth, and intelligence (interesting vocabulary) that you seldom find in the world of popular music.  The tunes vary from the aching (Permanent, Lie) to the fun (Bar-ba-sol).  Many have a haunting quality and have interesting twists (portions of Avalanche come to mind).  He gives each song his whole heart when performing.  I love this album, but am impressed that, so far, his live renditions have been even more impressive.  I can't wait for the tour!  Buy this.
B001ACH4DS|5.0|Finally, that wait is over. David Cook did a really amazing job on this album. Go out and get this album!!!!!!!!!!
B000JLSLZQ|3.0|Gerard Butler's singing made me cringe.  Actually, he didn't sing as much as shout in a role that demands an excellent tenor.  It killed a movie for me that otherwise was very good.  You can do Professor Harold Hill with a non-singer but not the Phantom.  Patrick Wilson did a fine job as Raoul.  Emma Rossum had youth and innocence applicable to the role, and her singing is passable but immature, not surprising given that she was 18 when she made it.  That Webber picked her personally shocks me since there are better singers.  Throughout the movie I longed to hear Sarah Brightman but not as much as I wanted to hear Michael Crawford.
B000001ESP|5.0|I bought this when it came out in vinyl as my first album.  This is classic; I can't believe my taste was that good back then.  Not a bad song on here.  Even the instrumental YYZ is well worth a listen.  If you haven't listened to Rush, then I have to warn you there is often something to get you thinking in the lyrics.  I personally think this is their best album overall, but I have probably listened to The Trees off Hemispheres more than any other single Rush song.
B001GAPC1K|5.0|Given the spate of disappointing superhero movies over the years, I wasn't terribly excited about \\"Iron Man.\\"  I probably would never have watched it if my wife hadn't wanted to rent it.  I'm glad she did, or else I would have missed a fun and entertaining movie.<br /><br />Robert Downey Jr. really made this movie shine.  It's a measure of the writing and direction that film could have succeeded with a different actor as Tony Stark.  But Downey really took the reins and put an indelible mark on the character all his own.  He completely owned every scene he was in.<br /><br />\\"Iron Man\\" successfully walked the fine line of taking itself seriously enough that you actually care about what happens without becoming so serious that the whole movie collapses under its own weight.  Favreau and Downey deserve equal credit for that.  And Favreau does a great job of keeping \\"Iron Man\\" moving.  Who would have thought back in the day of \\"Swingers\\" that Favreau would become a big-time A-list director?  Hollywood often fails to notice talent, so it's great to see him succeed.<br /><br />The Blu-Ray transfer is excellent, and the special features are enjoyable.  Perhaps the most special feature is after the end credits, a la Ferris Bueller; be sure to watch until the very end!<br /><br />I highly recommend this movie to fans of action movies, superhero films, SF movies, or anyone who just plain enjoys a good movie.
B001FSDOZO|4.0|This cd seems a little more polished (thanks to Mutt) which is good and bad.  You can tell that Nickelback has grown and is continuing to bring their sound more into the mainstream machine.    Overall, a good cd, I would recommend it for new Nickelback fans and old fans as well.
0805028846|5.0|I like trying all types of crafts, and a few years ago I came across OA and pop-up cards. I learn most of my crafts from books rather than craft classes, so a lot of my learning depends on finding the right book to learn from. At the time I found books that provide patterns for ready made designs. I adapted some of the designs for my needs but I wished I could find a book that gave me the tools and know-how to creat my own designs. This is the book I was looking for.It has clear step-by-step instructions and diagrams that indicate cuts and folds. Photographs illustrate each step as well as showcasing various pieces that demonstrate the principle being taught. At the end of the book there is a picture gallery of even more pop-up art that provides plenty of inspiration.
B001DTPZNY|4.0|I really enjoyed this addition to the Indiana Jones franchise.  It was great to see Harrison Ford is still able to hold his own in an action-adventure, especially in this role.  It was an interesting take on the \\"ancient astronaut\\" theory of psuedo-archaeology and I do wish they had touched on the subject a bit more explicitly in-dialogue to save me having to explain it to people I have seen the movie with.  I thought the movie contained just enough of both the grit and silliness I've come to expect from the Indy movies.    The DVD is great.  I am kind of disappointed at the placing of chapter starts.  I do understand though that they are broken into scenes and not just the cool action sequences I want to watch at the drop of a hat.  I have found though that if I just want to see the warehouse scene or the standard \\"Indy fights the guy much bigger than him\\" moment, I do end up inevitably watching the rest of the film from that point on, even if I hadn't initially intended to.  The bonus features on this single disc version were just enough to satisfy me.

B001ER4CNY|4.0|I received mine the other day.  The packaging is pretty nice.  It has a clear plastic outer box with nice graphics.  The discs are beautiful with high quality labeling and are also color coded by season. The video and audio quality is very good to excellent.  The discs are kept in a colorful, fan-out style holder.  The set also comes with 55 trivia cards packed in a nice, little fancy box.  I have just a few issues, some little, some not so little.  First, the 'bottle'.  It's touted as a 'replica' but it's made of cardboard and only looks like the actual bottle from an image seen when turned to the side.  A more realistic solid bottle would have been very cool even if made of only plastic.  They could have put the discs and holder lying flat in the base and had the base removable.  I know I'm going on but that's the way I would have done it.  I doubt it would have cost them much more.  Also, the discs are numbered 1 thru 20.  It probably would have been better to group the disc numbers by season.  For example, the first disc of Season 2 says 'Season 2, Disc 5' which was a bit confusing at first.  Another thing. . there is no episode guide included with this set.  That's a big miss as it makes it very difficult to know what disc has which episodes. Lastly, as some already know, the first season is the colorized version which may disappoint the purists.  Despite the negs, it's worth it as you're getting a high quality DVD set of the whole series for a little over $100.  And I'm glad I waited instead of buying the single season sets.
1433502410|5.0|Since many wrote detailed reviews already, I just wanted to write a concise review for those who seek it.<br />1. The notes are incredible and Christocentric. The ESV Study Bible (ESB) is like a single volume commentary. But please keep in mind that ESB is: Reformed and Charismatic. As far as Millennial views are concerned, ESB describes all three different views without committing to one view.<br />2. Color maps are really well done (not just at the end of the Bible), but within the notes and texts. Beautiful.<br />3. Articles, charts, and maps are really helpful summarizing what the Bible teaches. Also brief Protestant history is given.<br />4. The Bible is \\"Smyth-sewn\\"!!! This is stitched and NOT glued to the spine. So the copy will last a long time. Both NIV Study Bible & MacArthur Study Bible are glued to the spine.<br /><br />Overall, I love it. Although personally, I prefer NASB over ESV, the study notes on ESB in many cases (not all) far superior to NIV Study Bible or MacArthur Study Bible. Highly recommended!
0385751893|5.0|This book was incredible.  I'm about to read it again.  I'm sure that the negative reviewers who couldn't understand how Bruno didn't know what was going on around him read the book with the knowledge we have today about the holocost.  Back then it wasn't uncommon for people to be unaware of the horrors of what was done to the Jewish people.  I loved this book.
0316143472|4.0|Once again, Sedaris manages to plumb the depths of his adolescence and later life to turn the minutiae and absurdity of life into comedic genius. It's not as good as some of his earlier stuff, but you'll still walk away happy you read it.
0385340990|5.0|I loved this book.  What more can I add to the hundreds of 5-star reviews already here?  Co-author Annie Barrows eloquently summarizes the book in her video interview.  A charming, warming book, with a hint of humor, even if it describes some of the atrocities of World War II and the German occupation of Guernsey.
B001EOQWF8|3.0|It is my understanding that director Andrew Stanton (along with screenwriter Pete Docter) had a couple of ideas that came to fruition prior to WALL-E. Things you may have heard of like, oh, [[ASIN:B0015HS5S6 Finding Nemo]] and [[ASIN:B00168OIIU A Bug's Life]]. Wall-E was the final \\"idea\\" in the animation pipeline for Disney/Pixar and it is obvious to me why this was so after watching it. Let me explain...<br /><br />Let's start with the aforementioned [[ASIN:B0015HS5S6 Finding Nemo]]. Here was a story that was 95% focused on the main characters: fish and those around the fish (crabs, seagulls, pelicans, etc.). The dentist -- a human -- was a side-story; a vehicle for the plot, sure, but he wasn't what the film was about. The audience became enamored with Marlin (Nemo's father) and his adventures to find and save his son. Again, a great character scheme that got the audience attached to the title character and his father (and we can't forget Dori, the forgetful sidekick).<br /><br />Moving ahead several years we get to Wall-E, a story that isn't so well-formulated as far as characters go but has a decent message at its core: the survival of our planet.<br /><br />If the story had stuck to Wall-E's adventures and his need to connect with someone (anyone!), the story would've turned out just fine. True, the decent message may have gotten lost but film makers need audiences to feel empathetic toward the characters, and that's where Wall-E short circuits. The humans don't come into play until 20-plus minutes into this 98-minute feature and then we're completely given over to them and lose sight of Wall-E altogether ...for a while. This extreme detachment from the title character made the film feel more like two separate ones than a consistent whole.<br /><br />There are, however, some profoundly funny moments ...and some just plain profound things, too. Fred Willard ([[ASIN:B000F9RLL2 Date Movie]]) is the first human we see (but only through billboard displays) as the loathsome Shelby Forthright, CEO of the BnL corporation. His last name is a cautionary note to not trust someone just because of their name. John Ratzenberger ([[ASIN:B000VBJEFK Ratatouille]]) is John, an Earthly human in an un-Earthly ship where his every whim is cared for by automatons, turning him and his spaceshipmates into worthless sloths (another cautionary note to not let computers or technology run rampant over us). The spaceship's computer voice is probably one of the funniest of note, because it's narrated by Sigourney Weaver ([[ASIN:B000056BSG The Ice Storm]]). Anyone who's seen the [[ASIN:B0000VCZK2 Alien series]] and [[ASIN:B00003CXDV Galaxy Quest]] knows how Sigourney's previous characters feel about computers.<br /><br />Better known for his sound work in the more recent [[ASIN:B001E75QGG Indiana Jones 4]] flick, Ben Burtt lends his electrified voice as the main character, Wall-E. Although not much speaking takes place from Wall-E's standpoint, he does have some human moments of loneliness and tenderness (once another mechanical being arrives). EVE, Wall-E's love interest, is also electrifyingly voiced by voice actress Elissa Knight (she was Tia in the other Pixar hit, [[ASIN:B000V1Y43W Cars]]). Her arrival on Earth heralds new hope for Wall-E that his life of loneliness might come to an end.<br /><br />Despite all its character and whiplash faults, Wall-E is a movie of environmental importance. It shows us what we as humans might do to the only planet we can call home, and what might happen if we allow ourselves to go too far in damaging her. That, at the very least, makes this a watchable film.of the BnL corporation. His last name is a cautionary note to not trust someone just because of their name.

B001GQACGO|3.0|This album is definitely going to divide many people who may have been looking for another 'Dangerously In Love' or 'B'day' album, but if anything we can all agree that Beyonce is not afraid to try anything, and that's what being an artist is all about.  Whether this next installment in her journey wins people over remains to be seen, but if you aren't feeling it, she'll definitely draw you in somehow before too long.<br /><br />The only 'concept' of this album is the whole alter-ego persona set forth by one disc that offers a more genuine, pure, innocent Beyonce (I Am...) through a set of colorful ballads that definitely showcase her vocal ability versus another disc (Sasha Fierce) that is edgy, sassy, and hip-hop.  Not so 'creative' to be honest, as all these tracks could've easily fit onto a single disc and divided appropriately, but an A for effort.  I would've even been for pulling a Nelly and selling 2 separate CDs, possibly at two separate times (the ballads for the cold/winter months and then pushing the dance stuff out 6 months later as she prepares for tour).  I don't understand the purpose of releasing a regular version and a Deluxe Version that offers extra tracks, Sony could've simply made the Deluxe Version the ONLY version.  That marketing is beyond me and I'm sure the Deluxe Version will trump the regular.<br /><br />With that being said, a brief run down:<br /><br />I Am...: Beyonce is not raising any bars or venturing into uncharted territory.  At best, this is a departure from the soulful ballads we are used to hearing her belt out at times.  This type of music is no different then what Celine Dion, Mariah Carey, and Whitney Houston cranked out in the 80s and 90s, so I can't really say that she is stepping her game up on this set.  Many of the songs are in the vein of current Adult Contemporary/Pop chart-topper Leona Lewis, and when you listen to a bulk of them (especially with it being made known that 'Halo' was a song written for Lewis), it's quite easy to imagine her voice on the tracks instead.  Vocally, Beyonce delivers on this set, although sometimes she has the ablility to over-do it, which loses the power and essence of the track at times.

Songs like 'Radio,' 'Diva' (which samples Lil' Wayne's 'A Milli' too little too late and is best suitable for a mix tape some 3-4 months ago), and 'Video Phone' lyrically are all over the place and sound a bit immature and foolish in comparison to her previous bangers, as well as the tone set with the first disc.  The beats are hot and club-friendly, suitable more for a rapper than a singer, but the melodies are off quite a bit.  This disc in all honesty is a let down as a whole, but some will beg to differ.

B001DU8T6I|4.0|Okay, first off, I will admit that I'm NOT a Disney fan. The Disney people know now is a little past my generation. I never really liked Miley Cyrus, I thought Camp Rock was a bad movie, and I can't really get into the Jonas Bros. So to say the least, I was skeptical.    I heard her single, \\"Get Back\\" because it was on the radio and I liked it. I downloaded the song, but I never considered getting her entire album until recently. Now, I've been playing it non-stop practically.    The best thing about her is that her lyrics are not specialized towards a particular population. There are obvious lines that are supposed to appeal to her Disney audience (wearing converses in \\"La La Land\\"), but songs like \\"Don't Forget\\" have no targeted audience. It could be a song about a middle-aged couple and I don't think you would have noticed if it wasn't a teenage girl singing it. She balances maturity and adolescence very well.     I'll admit that the second half of the album that is more sappier, and is not as enjoyable as the first half, but \\"Believe in Me\\" does showcase her voice, which is actually pretty nice.    Best tracks: La La Land, Trainwreck, and Don't Forget. The duet with the Jonas Bros is also great.     Track that could have been better: \\"The Middle.\\" If there is one song you don't download, I guess it would be this. It's one of those mediocre songs. It's not really upbeat, but it's not a ballad either. It just gets lost in the rest of the album.    But anyway, this album is definitely worth a listen...especially if you're not a Disney fan.

I would've even been for pulling a Nelly and selling 2 separate CDs, possibly at two separate times (the ballads for the cold/winter months and then pushing the dance stuff out 6 months later as she prepares for tour). I don't understand the purpose of releasing a regular version and a Deluxe Version that offers extra tracks, Sony could've simply made the Deluxe Version the ONLY version. That marketing is beyond me and I'm sure the Deluxe Version will trump the regular.<br /><br />With that being said, a brief run down:<br /><br />I Am...: Beyonce is not raising any bars or venturing into uncharted territory. At best, this is a departure from the soulful ballads we are used to hearing her belt out at times. This type of music is no different then what Celine Dion, Mariah Carey, and Whitney Houston cranked out in the 80s and 90s, so I can't really say that she is stepping her game up on this set. Many of the songs are in the vein of current Adult Contemporary/Pop chart-topper Leona Lewis, and when you listen to a bulk of them (especially with it being made known that 'Halo' was a song written for Lewis), it's quite easy to imagine her voice on the tracks instead. Vocally, Beyonce delivers on this set, although sometimes she has the ablility to over-do it, which loses the power and essence of the track at times. However, this is the better of the two discs in my opinion.<br /><br />Stand out tracks:<br />-If I Were A Boy<br />-Halo<br />-Disappear<br />-Broken Hearted Girl<br />-Ave Maria<br /><br />Sasha Fierce: 'Sasha Fierce' plays on Beyonce's stage persona Sasha, but loses focus right after 'Single Ladies (Put A Ring On It).' Songs like 'Radio,' 'Diva' (which samples Lil' Wayne's 'A Milli' too little too late and is best suitable for a mix tape some 3-4 months ago), and 'Video Phone' lyrically are all over the place and sound a bit immature and foolish in comparison to her previous bangers, as well as the tone set with the first disc. The beats are hot and club-friendly, suitable more for a rapper than a singer, but the melodies are off quite a bit. This disc in all honesty is a let down as a whole, but some will beg to differ. I truly expected more given what she's been capable of in the past.<br /><br />Stand out tracks:<br />-Single Ladies (Put A Ring On It)<br />-Sweet Dreams<br /><br />Overall, this album is average, just like her other works; a live performance, tour, or video is what will take it over the edge speaking as unbiased as I possibly can where she is concerned. Nothing extraordinary or brilliant here, not even classic. A definite risk. This will definitely be a test for fans of her previous works. Will they jump on board, or abandon ship?the tracks instead.

B001GQSY5K|5.0|Here we go again.  Another star wars movie with a twist...its animated.  I am not a avid star wars fan, however, I have seen the new trilogy not the old one.  I was excited to finally see this movie and I wasn't disappointed. The plot was simplistic at best and wasn't bombarded with idle chit-chat. It was a thrill ride from beginning to end, I don't care about the naysayers have to say.  I felt that the movie was fresh, a nice change of pace, amazing feature film.  The action never stifled or faltered it kept up with the film.  The relationship between Anakin and the padawan was incredibly deep and moving.  I felt a connection and was rewarded.  If you are a crazed star wars fan you will nick pick this movie to death. Watch this movie because it was to the point and filled with action.  I recommend this film.
B001EOQWF8|1.0|I think that Wall-E is a dismal failure as a children's film. Oh, yes, throw in an environmental message. Forget to use any meaningful dialogue throughout the film. Use songs from the 1960's with which children cannot begin to identify. Show earth as a desolate planet. Take Wall-E's purpose of making garbage cubes and repeat it over and over. Bore little children, whose parents thought they were bringing their kids to a quality family movie. Love story? Oh, yes, children really like a love story between two robotic personalities who don't talk. Lastly, everyone has got to be attracted to a film with fat people floating around, being too lazy to care for themselves. Ah, that captain figure was really something. What ever happened to Wall-E during that detour? What a sad waste of Walt Disney/Pixar talent!
B001GM28HO|4.0|I heard her on Just Dance and then was floored by how awesome \\"Paper Gangsta\\" and \\"Starstruck\\" was right after that. Many people have compared her to Madonna because of her dance songs which I think is pretty accurate if you factor in her videos and...uniqueness. She sounds like Madonna to me as well in certain songs.    However, I actually love her in her softer songs, probably the complete opposite of most people. Summerboy is definitely Blondie-ish and anytime she sings something softer, it takes me back to the 80's for some reason. Actually, most of her songs have a new wave feel. I like that; she's kicking it old school.    It does get a little repetitve though (Poker Face sounds like Just Dance) and I doubt she'll be hailed as a creative innovator, but overall, this was a pretty good album.
1401307957|5.0|Danny Gregory has gone through some rough stuff; his seemingly ideal life, in accordance with all the myths of what makes an 'ideal life', was going along according to script until suddenly everything changed... but then isn't conflict the very item necessary for excellent drama and mandatory for positive resolution?  In this instance Gregory reached out for something to help him and when he brought his hand back there was a pen in it. He used it to draw and to communicate.    With that pen Danny Gregory has turned his troubles into a cottage industry of sketch journaling and has assisted many others to see and record their lives with a new eye-view towards the everyday, the minutia, the otherwise mundane... all of which sparkle and dance in this renewed sense of seeing.      This is not a brilliant work, it is a solid look into a man's solace... a total sharing of his moments.  There is not a bit of polish or glitter.  IT is as real as it gets and it is a joy to be able to share these moments with a man I have come to respect through his writing and drawing.
B000TGJ80S|4.0|[[ASIN:B000TGJ80S Bram Stoker's Dracula (Collector's Edition)]]  A beautiful and tragic love story.  The connection between Mina and Dracula is powerful and soulful.  You sympathize with Dracula's deep sorrow for having lost the love of his life.  Mina is his reincarnated lost love.  The costumes, erotic intimations, imagery, and cinematography are breath-taking.  The characters are painted in a sophmoric stroke, save for Gary Oldman's portrayal of Vlad/Dracula.  He is stunning in this role.
B000069HJI|4.0|As with the rest of the Supertramp remasters - long overdue, even in 2002 - the sound quality here is fantastic.  Supertramp always took care in the studio to record and construct their albums with fantastic sound and lots of dynamic range.  Given this was Hodgson's last album (and subsequent tour), the lyrics become tinged with sadness and meta-meaning beyond their context in the songs.<br /><br />However...  I don't know the specifics of the how or why, but the beginning of \\"Bonnie\\" is glitched up.  To my ear, it sounds as if someone with a razor blade or some digital editing software tried to recreate the beginning of the track, but used the later repetition when the xylophone came in over the piano to replay the opening phrase.  Anyway, the result is just wrong, and bugged me until I pulled out my old copy of the CD and (there's that digital editing software again) took the beinning of the track from the old CD and 'pasted' it over the offending phrase.  I felt better after that.  ;)
1416914293|5.0|WELL FIRST OF ALL THIS SERIES IS WORTH A READ. WHAT I LIKE ABOUT IT IS HOW ITS A LIL PREDICTABLE BUT AT THE SAME TIME THE AUTHOR THROWS IN AN UNKNOWN FACTOR THAT MAKES EVERYTHING GO HAYWIRE!<br /><br />THIS BOOK IN PARTICULAR WAS VERY EXITING AND TAKES YOU A BIT DEEPER INTO THE SHADOWHUNTER WORLD. GIVES YOU THE HISTORY AND ANSWERS YOUR QUESTIONS WHILE THE ACTION IS HAPPENING. I WISH THEY COULD INCLUDE MAYBE A PICTURE OF A RUNE OR SOMETHING FROM THE STORY CAUSE ITS REALLY INTERESTING TO READ AND TRY TO IMAGINE THE PEOPLE AND WEAPONS AND RUNES ETC. AND OF COURSE WHO DOESNT LOVE THE MAIN CHARACTERS LOVE TRIANGLE? BUT MY FAVORITE PART OF THE STORY IS DEFINITLY THE MAGNUS AND ALEC DRAMA! :-P<br /><br />a GOOD READ WITH GREAT CHARACTERS. I RECOMEND THIS TO ALL

B001F0VHEM|4.0|I like this album, but I like \\"I'm Not Dead\\" better though.    1. \\"So What\\" - 10/10, I love this song! Great radio hit. It's so in your face and fun.   2. \\"Sober\\" - 10/10, another great one, I love the lyrics, violins, and the overall production of this song. I smell another hit.  3. \\"I Don't Believe You\\" - 1/10, my least favorite on the album, it's pretty bland and boring, and kind of drags on, not amazing by Pink's standards.  4. \\"One Foot Wrong\\" - 7/10, it's good in a 60's/70's sort of way, but again not amazing, and kind of forgetable.  5. \\"Please Don't Leave Me\\" - 8/10, I like this song quite a bit, the production's pretty good on it.  6. \\"Bad Influence,\\" - 10/10, Another fun and in your face song, it's great, and you'll have a blast singing along and listening to it.  7. \\"Funhouse\\" - 9/10, great lyrics and great beat.  8. \\"Crystal Ball\\" - 5/10, reminds me of \\"The One That Got Away\\" from \\"I'm Not Dead.\\" This song is better however, but still pretty forgetable.  9. \\"Mean\\" - 10/10, I love this song, especially the chorus, very good vocals and lyrics.  10. \\"It's All Your Fault\\" - 10/10, great track, love the production, and the song's catchy, I could see it as a radio hit.  11. \\"Ave Mary A\\" - 10/10, I love the guitars on this track and the lyrics are very powerful.  12. \\"Glitter In The Air\\" - 9/10, great ballad, very beautiful song.   --------------------------------------------------------------------------    I think they could have made this album better if they put tracks like \\"Boring,\\" \\"This Is How It Goes Down,\\" and \\"Could've Had Everything\\" on the album, instead some of the mediocre songs on the album, but oh well. Overall, great job P!nk!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1591841666|3.0|This is an interesting little book exploring a very important set of concepts. But despite the subtitle, it does a poor job of explaining when to quit and when to keep going.    Godin's theory is clear enough. The book falls short on practical guidelines and specific, real-world examples that will help the reader decipher their own complicated situation. It's like an outline for a how-to book, without most of the content that would make it usable. I hope that Godin will develop his concepts in enough detail to make them teachable, and then write a second book that really does the job.
1563894696|5.0|Not long after Batman's arrival in Gotham City, he, Captain Jim Gordon and District Attorney Harvey Dent are making slow progress in cracking the criminal empire of Carmine 'the Roman' Falcone, whose reach extendeds into seemingly every nook of the city from the alleys to the courtrooms and boardrooms.  Into this a new player mysteriously enters on Halloween night, an unseen killer who comes to strike on nearly every major holiday, taking out someone else close to the Roman or his empire.  The mystery of the identity of this 'Holiday killer', and the events triggered by the killings, are the main focus of The Long Halloween, while subplots involving many of Gotham's most famous denizens are woven in seamlessly.    The Long Halloween, taking a full year of comics time to unfold, occurs in and around other events that took place early in the Dark Knight's career.  Suspects and motives for the killings are in plentiful supply, and among the suspects are the three main figures on the side of good, Batman, Gordon, and Dent, who have to entertain the possibility that one of their allies could be the suspect they're all searching for.  Adding to the tension of the situation, not all of the murder victims are criminals; being close to Falcone is enough to get you killed, and not all of Falcone's immediate family are members of his 'Roman Empire'.  Falcone, his family, associates and rivals are probed in depth here.  One of the most interesting things in The Long Halloween is the dicotomy between different aspects of the same person.  Carmine Falcone, for example, is both a devoted, generous family man, and a guy who tried to have his nephew assasinated when he thought the nephew was going to testify against him.  Falcone's pain at the deaths of his friends and family members over the year is real, but he himself doesn't hesitate to rob others of their lives and family with the activities of his crime empire.  In one of the most memorable scenes in a tale full of memorablescenes, the Batman even confronts Falcone with this.      In The Long Halloween, you see the transition from Gotham as a crime-ridden city under the thumb of a traditional mafia-style organization - the Roman's Empire - to the Gotham of 'today': full of monsters, costumed madmen and assorted other 'freaks'.  The transition was gradual; Batman didn't just show up into a normal city one day and then the next week busloads of freaks abruptly arrived.  Gotham had been 'weird' for a long time (Solomon Grundy, for example, has periodically wreaked carnage in and and around Gotham for years prior to Batman's first appearance) but in The Long Halloween you see the transition accelerating; even the Falcone syndicate is on some level aware that things are irrevocably changing as they find themselves forced to turn to costumed figures such as the Riddler for help in trying to figure out Holiday's identity.  There's a fantastic double page shot on Pages 342-343 that illustrates this 'transition' brilliantly.      Writer Jeph Loeb and artists Time Sale are at the top of their games here.  Loeb expertly fills in a lot of blanks about the history of Gotham and some of its best characters; Sale's artwork is some of the most distinctive in comics and suits the tale perfectly; Gregory Wright's colors are the perfect complement to Sale's art.       Random pluses and minuses: the way most of the issues reprinted herein (Long Halloween # s 1-13) end on big events or cliffhangers is good, and so is the touching scene just before the end of issue two.  Speaking of individual issues, I'm glad they're separated by the cover arts to each issue, instead of gathering the covers at the back; I wish DC would present all their collections this way.  One negative is that, in the investigation of the Holiday killings, we see very little of the actual detective work being done, we don't follow with the investigation to see what clues are and aren't left, forensics-wise, for example.  If it had been, it could have added to the fun in every whodunit of trying to figure out the killer for oneself.  One thing that could be viewed as a negative, but that I don't, is the fact that Batman - a non-superhuman - manages to get the best of Solomon Grundy during their encounter.  The reason I don't think this is a negative is this: it's been established that Grundy's temperament and intelligence vary with his different incarnations; it's become just as obvious by now though that his physical parameters vary to a much Greater extent with each incarnation.  Presumably, Batman would have been much harder pressed against an incarnation of Grundy that can go blow for blow against Superman.  And another great positive - the definitive, detailed origin of one of Batman's greatest enemies, who I'll refrain from naming, is in here.      'The Long Halloween' is essential DC - longtime fans will love how so many different elements and characters come together in a great tale, and for people who've never read a Batman comic in their life this is an excellent place to start - back close to the beginning, with lots of the main characters, and leaving you hungry for more.
B000VBIEXS|5.0|ELP is one of the few bands who apparently have classical backgrounds, as evidenced by this album in which they electrify Bach, I believe, in \\"Toccata.\\" Their use of the synthesizer was cutting edge and still brings this rocker to his head-bangin' feet.  \\"Karn Evil 9...\\" could be called their signature piece and \\"Benny the Bouncer\\" is just plain fun.
0321544080|3.0|I consider myself an advanced amateur. Over many years I've progressed to the Nikon D300 with a nice assortment of gear. I bought this book after reading Scott Kelby's \\"Digital Photography Book-Volume 2,\\" great book and very useful to amateur photographers. At the end of the book, Kelby strongly recommends \\"your next book\\" should be \\"The Moment It Clicks.\\" So I ordered it. It is a fine book of pictures, with descriptions of how the majority of the photos were taken. However, you need to know this guy has more gear than imaginable (it's all pictured at the end of the book), and an assistant. Probably 98% of all the photos are taken with the aid of light boxes, movie lights, what have you. I guess my point is, unless you are an advanced professional, this is a nice book of pictures.
B001JNNDGA|1.0|Let us surmise that in the heady early days of the Third (or Temporary) Reich, Herr Doktor Gobbles commissioned ... um ooops ... Doktor Goebbels commissioned a film the purpose of which would be to discredit Christianity.  Let us further surmise that the result was a film called \\"The Passion of the Christ\\".  Given these results, the filmmaker would have been awarded German filmdom's highest award, the Adolf, plus a special thorn cluster authorized by Herr Doktor Goebbels.  That was then.    This is now.  And here it is at last:  a new technologically advanced edition of the world's slimiest \\"Bible\\" travesty in all its Gospel-bashing, anti-Semitic, and fantasy-pushing glory.      Aside from its propagandistic purposes, \\"Passion\\" is so full of inaccuracies, it's hard to know where to start.  Let's start by noting that the only historically worthwhile (if not necessarily accurate) narratives we have of the so-called \\"passion\\" are the 4 canonical gospels.  Nothing else of a non-scholarly nature is worth the paper it's printed on.  This film depends on apocryphal (and useless) narratives, the ravings of a 19th-Century hysteric nun, and other fraudulent \\"sources\\".   In addition there are other solecisms of a purely stupid nature.      For instance, Gibson thinks he's really clever by having people speak the languages they would have spoken at the time.  And then, laughably, he has Jesus and Pilate conversing in Latin.  Latin was not the lingua franca of the Roman East ... that was Greek.  Furthermore, Jesus was born (at Bethlehem-in-Galilee, not Bethlehem-in-Judea) and raised in Galilee, an area which was under the Hebrew- and Greek-speaking rule of various Herods.  Jesus and Pilate would have spoken in Greek.  (The argument that Jesus would have learned Latin from Roman soldiers is just silly ... Galilee was part of an autonomous kingdom and Roman soldiers didn't enter the area until after the exile of Herod Antipas in 39 CE.  Besides, the Roman military spoke a patois of Italic - related to Latin - that was widely used in northern Italy.)    Gibson's contempt for the canonical gospels is a main theme of the film.  In Gethsemane, Jesus is shown not so much praying to his god but having a conversation with Satan - something the gospel writers seem totally unaware of.  Later on, the soldiers that arrest Jesus throw him bodily from a bridge - an event utterly absent from the gospels.      The events between Jesus' arrest and his crucifixion show not only Gibson's contempt for the gospels, but also his utter ignorance of the practices of Roman law and the evidence of archaeology.  The bit covering his appearance before the Sanhedrin is hilarious.  The charge - the only charge - was actually a term totally misused these days, \\"blasphemy\\".  That is, in the Greek, \\"blasphemia\\", which means treason, in the sense that Jesus has claimed to be King of Judea.   Despite pathetic attempts by Christians, from the First Century CE on, to give this term a religious connotation, it is a political crime, pure and simple.  Gibson's failure to recognize this fact is stupid - as is everything else in this film.      The scourging of Jesus is a good example of Gibson's contempt for facts.  Roman judicial procedure is well known and the gospels in fact do a fair job of showing it correctly.  Gibson's version is not only inaccurate, it's trashy.  The pronouncing of sentence of crucifixion ends with this sentence:  \\"Let him be scourged.\\"  No person to be tried before a Roman court was whipped until that sentence was uttered.      Furthermore, the whip shown in this film wasn't the one used in these cases - it was employed by Gibson solely for its shock value, not in any interest of accuracy.  The actual whip (Latin: flagellum) consisted of several strands of leather of varying length, each tied to a small lead ball.  If you believe the Shroud of Turin is any sort of genuine artifact, please note that it is that whip whose marks appear on the back of the individual portrayed in the shroud.  This tool of punishment also appears in archaeological contexts.      The number of strokes was limited to a those needed to start a flow of blood - the purpose of scourging being primarily to weaken the victim and shorten his/her time on the cross.  They were delivered by a trained professional.  What Gibson's film shows is not only ridiculously excessive but incomprehensibly and improbably brutal.  This portrayal is clearly for salacious shock value and not any concern for truth.  It is at this point (if not before) that the film degenerates into a work of pure fiction.    There is, however, more degeneracy to come.  In a scene that occurs nowhere in the gospels nor any other creditable source, Mary is wandering among the pools of blood in the courtyard in which Jesus was scourged.  We'll forego questioning how she got past all those guards into a secure area of a Roman fortress.  Then out trundles Mrs. Pilate with an armload of bedsheets or used togas or some such.  She vanishes and Mary begins to mop up all the blood with togas or sheets or whatever.  Say what?  Is she collecting souvenirs?  I can see a framed slice of sheet on a humble wall in Nazareth.  \\"There's a toga of actual blood!\\"  What ... you don't like the bit about the frame on the wall?  That's just as disgusting and stupid as somebody mopping up blood in the first place.  No wonder the gospels ignore the whole silly story in the first place.  Not only is it silly, it's a fairy tale insulting to the intelligence of anyone whose cerebrum's weight exceeds 1 ounce.    Ah, but wherefore Herr Dr. Goebbels' award of the prestigious thorn cluster?  Well, of course:  the film's stunning if subtle anti-Semitism.  We could point to the film's zeal in promoting the old canard that the Jews \\"forced\\" a conviction on a Roman governor who in fact would just as soon crucify people as look at them.    We can and do point to one of the film's most prominent characters - one who actually appears only once, in a brief sentence, in the gospels' passion narratives.  This character is Satan, the so-called devil, who pops up everywhere in this film.  This character is the most palpable, horrifying manifestation of the film's anti-Semitism.  This manifestation takes the form of Satan being cast as a First Century Jew ... right down to the shawl over his head.      This libelous identification of Judaism with Christianity's evil angel must of course give much schadenfreude to nutters like the Aryan Brotherhood, the American Nazi Party, and others who live only to hate.  Gibson's depiction of Satan as an embodiment of Judaism - this nation's moral bedrock - is an act of the most desperate bigotry.    Considering that \\"Passion\\" is a tissue of lies and misrepresentations, an affront to anyone who values and respects the gospels, and a virtual celluloid hate crime, we would expect Christians everywhere to shun it for the arrant nastiness that it is.  But what do we find?  They are busy declaring this shabby travesty a triumph of their faith.  What does that say of them?  Fools have rushed in where our better angels would fear to tread.    Shame, Mel Gibson; shame, shame.

B00188M5TM|4.0|Just by chance we went to see CHANGELING right after we saw AUGUST RUSH, the 2007 musical melodrama which deals with a mother and son separated by cruel fate and yearning to be reunited.  While the new film is about 100 times better than AUGUST RUSH, it still lacks a certain something I can't put my finger on, but probably it is that because it is a true story, director Clint Eastwood can't improvise on the story of Christine Collins, the tragic mother from 1920s Los Angeles who lost her son not once, but twice, -- or did she?  The ending is left in a delicate suspension.<br /><br />Despite a certain dramatic inertia in the film, I'm glad that Eastwood and his screenwriter did not go the way of current Hollywood screenwriting commandments.  A Syd Field style screenplay would have made sure that Christine (Angelina Jolie) would gather some unlikely, even wacky, allies and storm the citadel where where her boy was being held.  I can see them now, brigades of roller skating switchboard operators hollering defiance and unexpected physical strength.  In a way, the movie actually veers in that direction a little bit, when it introduces Amy Ryan as Carol Becker, a prostitute with a heart of gold who teaches Christine a valuable lesson about the meaning of courage.  I wonder if the Carol Becker subplot was \\"true,\\" somehow I doubt it, it seems very much an invention of our current age where we value solidarity between classes above all else, certainly dramatic credibility.  That said, the scenes with Ryan and Jolie are among the best in the movie: both women should win Oscars, but will they?  Will Hollywood ever forgive Angelina Jolie for being so willful?  Year after year, she turns in great performance, and yet the snubs keep coming.  Maybe it was kissing her brother on the lips the night she did win the one Oscar from GIRL INTERRUPTED.<br /><br />Well, in a certain sense CHANGELING is like a prequel to GIRL INTERRUPTED and it looks like they filmed it right in the same inhuman;y cruel insane asylum.  Angelina never looks more beautiful then when her smoldering eyes and twiching nose are photographed from behind the bars of those little grates in the door that contemptuous guards and nurses can slam on her, little knowing she will be back for heavy revenge as soon as its time for the penultimate reel.  CHANGELING seems like it's going to be about police corruption; then it turns into a story about one heroic cop and how he penetrates a wall of indifference and deceit to uncover the horrible crimes of a serial killer--maybe to show that, even in 1928 LA, cops aren't *uniformly* evil slaves of Moloch?  Eastwood brings all of these different films in on time with a master's steady hand.  If I were producing a film about paint drying, I'd try to get him to direct it, for at least it would be hypnotically interesting and look authentically period.<br /><br />Warning, the film is really extraordinarily violent and upsetting, and please don't bring your children, it is too intense for them right now.<br /><br />PS., Was the traditional carol \\"Silent Night\\" actually sung by one of the leading characters right in the very site and time that the screenplay has him do it--only to get broken off when he reaches the words, \\"Round von virgin mother and child?\\"sane asylum.

The first cut, \\"So What\\", is the best track, it starts the album off with a rocket, really the song is so Pink, and though some have not liked the odd beat, I for one, Love It!  I really dig the part in the song where she does like an Axl Rose grunt, it's totally infectious.  Pink is one of the best of the younger artists and this album is one of her strongest..I mean I dont hope for her to have a break up everytime she puts out an album, but it does make for great music..I mean, right?
B001KVZ6BG|5.0|Warning!  Minor spoilers can be found in this review!<br /><br />Although I've seen some really good movies this year, I can say with confidence that SLUMDOG MILLIONAIRE is the one that I've enjoyed most.  It has already generated perhaps the best critical reviews of any film released in 2008 and has won audience awards at notable film festivals.  The film completely lives up to the hype that has surrounded it.<br /><br />In the first couple of minutes of the film we learn several things.  First, Jamal, a Muslim who is a product of the slums, is a participant on the Indian version of WHO WANTS TO BE A MILLIONAIRE?  Second, he is suspected of cheating and is subjected to horrific torture at the hands of the police.  Gradually, after having failed to elicit confessions of how he had cheated, Jamal related, while they all watch a video of his television appearance, how he knew the answers of each of the questions.  The result is a series of flashbacks that essentially tell the story of Jamal's life and his relations with the two most important relationships in his life, that of his street smart but sometimes amoral brother Salim, and Latika.  These scenes are set in some of the most horrific squalor that one can imagine.  It may seem unrealistic that someone could come out of such wretched life experiences as relatively unscarred as Jamal appears to be, but that is in part because at heart the film is a fairy tale.  It is not an expose of the abuses of modern economic life.  At heart it is a love story.<br /><br />I am not a big fan of director Danny Boyle, not having enjoyed at all 28 DAYS or TRAINSPOTTING or his other efforts, but his work here is nothing short of miraculous.  I knew none of the cast, though I've read that several members are well known Bollywood actors.  This film, I have to hasten to add, has nothing in common with a Bollywood film apart from some of the actors.  Though filmed in India, this is every bit a Western film.  There are many marvelous performances, not least Dev Patel as Jamal.  There are a number of child actors who turn in remarkable performances.  And as the grown up Latika, the newcomer Freida Pinto is fascinating to look at with her almost surreal beauty.<br /><br />As I said, despite the squalid settings for much of the film, this is a fairy tale, a love story.  But even knowing that the film ends as a fairy tale does not prepare one for the particulars.  There were a number of ways that it might have ended and while the ending wasn't completely unexpected, it wasn't entirely predictable.  In the end, this was a thoroughly enjoyable film, equal parts love story and comedy, set against the backdrop of almost inconceivable squalor.  There has been talk of this Indie film perhaps pulling a LITTLE MISS SUNSHINE and receiving some Oscar attention.  We can only hope.Dev Patel as Jamal.

B000PC6A3E|5.0|Batman Begins scored very well earning five full stars in my book. This film can almost be guaranteed not to disappoint. It portrayed for the first time on the big screen the origins of the bat providing a good story and script, fine performances, excellent costumes, great sets coordinated with corresponding miniatures and CGI. The well presented martial arts sequences between the Bat and our favorite Jedi Master were thrilling.<br /><br />The Blu Ray transfer from film to DVD was excellent and hours of additional features on the making of the film and its outstanding special effects are included on this reasonably priced DVD. This film is a must buy for fans of Batman.<br /><br />This may have been the first time that picture real computer images were produced by mapping actual city photos onto wire frame models of Gotham City with breathtaking results. I had no idea how they achieved these images until I watched the interesting and informative documentary on the making of the film.<br /><br />This film also portrayed many of Batman's toys under development in the Bat Cave, including the most credible looking Bat mobile ever shown on the big screen.

1416594884|5.0|After reading the first few lines of A MOST WANTED MAN by John le Carré, the setting is not only clearly revealed, it presents a sinister sense of foreboding. Hamburg, Germany, is the background against which the story is juxtaposed. Some readers may be tipped off by this choice of location, where at least six of the 9/11 terrorists, including Mohammed Atta, were undisturbed in plotting their attack. In addition, the dark shadow of Baader-Meinhof lurks in the background.    But as the novel opens we observe a skulking, emaciated, barely clothed young man moving around from pillar to post in the middle of a cold night and very erratic in his manner. Yet something about his determination to stay where he is, huddled in the shadows and then sometimes showing himself, appears studied, deliberate and determined not to leave the area near the train station. Despite trying to hide himself in plain sight, he strikes a strange pose in this ultra rich city, in his beggar's garb and subservient posture. He seems to be waiting for someone or something but is clearly unable to find who or what it is.    Melik Oktay is a Turkish heavyweight, a runner-up in the North German Championship hundred-meter butterfly stroke and star goalkeeper of his soccer team. He and his mother are leaving a travel shop when he and the stranger make eye contact. Something about him strikes a chord in Melik, but aside from noticing the deplorable shape this person is in, he is used to seeing the dregs of all kinds of humanity around the train station. Over the next few days the young \\"beggar\\" seems to be following Melik, who is at a loss to know why or quite what to do about it. Then, out of the blue, Melik answers his doorbell and finds the man holding a piece of cardboard that says in Turkish, \\"I am a Muslim medical student. I am tired and I wish to stay in your house. Issa.\\" Melik notices a tiny gold replica of the Koran dangling from a bracelet on the boy's wrist. Just as Melik is about to chase him away, Layla intervenes and insists upon taking him into their home. She establishes him in the attic and embraces him as she would a long-lost son.    Issa tries to communicate in a guttural dialect of Turkish. But he could have been Russian. Layla finds out he is a Muslim and had been in prison in Istanbul. When she tries speaking to him in Chechen, they learn that is where he came from. Issa tells them a story that begins with him being smuggled away from his prison by bad people he had to pay. He became part of a group in which he and others were stuffed into a container where they could hardly breathe. They were then put on a ship that was to take them to Denmark (perhaps Copenhagen). But they took a detour to Gothenburg, Sweden, where he escaped back to the ship to Copenhagen. There, he boarded a Chechen lorry bound for Hamburg, and here he is. Melik is driven to the edge of his credulity and by his fury over the inconsistencies of what he has just heard. Even his claim to be a Muslim seems false when his practices do not adhere to the religion's edicts.    The Oktays become more and more uncomfortable with Issa in their home. Mr. Oktay is dead, and although the house is paid off, he was the only one with official German credentials. Layla has been desperately trying to have her status legalized and, with that, Issa's. With all of this in mind, they send Issa to an agency that specializes in helping immigrants.    Annabel Richter is part of Sanctuary North, \\"A Charitable Christian Foundation for the protection of stateless and displaced persons in the region of North Germany.\\" She is a gung-ho, novice attorney who asks to advocate for Issa. He shows her a small bag around his neck that he claims holds the means he can use to access money from a bank account held by a private bank. The nickname for the special account is Lipizzaner. When the cash is secreted away it is black, and when it sees the light of day it has turned white, a process known as money laundering.    Tommy Brue, the sole surviving partner of an international banking house, is drawn into Issa's life story through secrets about his bank that he doesn't want to remember or know. His father was not always the conservative power broker he purported to be. His dealings with elements of dishonest Soviets, the mafia and others made the bank fortunes, but to Tommy these were ill-gotten gains of which he wanted no part. And for most of his career he has kept his distance from these old transactions only to find the alleged and unlikely legatee (Issa) coming forth in a most unusual way. He receives a mysterious and cryptic phone call from Annabel, who says she must meet with him immediately on behalf of a client.    Meetings convene, calls are made, papers are prepared, and Issa demands that all of his inheritance be donated to his hero, Dr. Abdullah (known by others as \\"Signpost\\" since Abdullah's idol, Sayyed Qutub, wrote the spiritual handbook of all Islamic militants, called Signposts Along the Way), who he believes is \\"a man of G-d\\" known for his philanthropic work to help the world's forgotten people. More calls and meetings ensue, and soon, among the three principals (Issa, Annabel and Tommy) arrangements are made for a final distribution of the fortune to be held at the bank --- all kept under wraps and secret.    Or so they think. It never occurs to any of them that they are being watched, followed, tape-recorded and not in control of their destinies. The \\"protectors\\" are made up of different anti-terrorism groups: German, British and American, each with agendas and egos that allow them all to skirt the law or make it up as they go along. The only one still not completely jaded and perverse is Gunther Bachman, who does not ascribe to the philosophy of the British and American \\"spooks,\\" who believe they can do anything they want to anyone they think may be a terrorist. Bachman is not really interested in Issa per se; he has his eye on Signpost, who he believes is sending money not to charities but to terrorists. Could Issa know this? And is this why he demands that the Imam have all of his inheritance? Or is Bachman correct in his assessment of Issa and in direct conflict with his superiors?    John le Carré's worldview has always been to put human rights in the forefront of any political tension --- and that is clear in A MOST WANTED MAN. He also devotes time to his observation of the ineptness of today's spy masters and anti-terrorist agencies. Readers may already know that le Carré was a British spy. And in his long career, in which he has produced 21 novels, it's not a stretch to understand that his experience, coupled with a strong sense of the human condition and nurtured by his intelligence and imagination, has made him the master of the spy novel. During the Cold War he had a firma terra from which to draw his tales, but in today's world nothing is clear and each day brings new atrocities. A MOST WANTED MAN is many things in addition to being a strong polemic presented in fiction and represents the rage he seems to feel about how the West is fighting against Islamic terrorism.    But regardless of how le Carré expresses his personal politics in his novels, one thing has remained a constant in his work: his honesty. He never tries to mislead his readers nor does he try to disabuse them of their own opinions. Sometimes he may sound shrill or arrogant, and that should provoke readers to start thinking about their world and what is happening in it, especially in today's uncertain times. le Carré is continuing his code of honor and attempting to tell everyone that the \\"emperor has no clothes.\\"        --- Reviewed by Barbara Lipkien Gershenbaum

B000VUQ4HW|3.0|Ironically, for a film that is 86 years old, \\"Nosferatu\\" starts off, like a bad, self-produced YouTube video.    Thankfully, it improves.    I've always wanted to watch the first vampire movie ever made and the one that is often considered the greatest adaptation of Bram Stoker's \\"Dracula.\\" Recently, I was able to.  It's an unofficial version and Stoker's estate actually sued German Director F.W. Murnau over it. All copies of the film were ordered destroyed.    Obviously, it survived.    Murnau, who died in a car crash at age 43, didn't even try very hard to disguise the movie: naming Harker Huffer and Count Dracula Count Orlok, leaving little doubt about the source material.    It's difficult for a generation weaned on special effects, surround sound, and the miracle of HD-TV to really appreciate \\"Nosferatu\\" (1922) without boredom setting in (even at a short 80 minutes). The pacing is arduous and editing reflects the limited technologies of the day.    \\"Nosferatu\\" is black-and-white (and most versions, including the one I watched, are scratchy and a bit faded on the edges). It's also a silent film, the narrative constantly interrupted by written dialog boxes.    There's also a lot of overacting employed by actors of the day (after all they needed to convey in action what is now done through speech). But to modern audiences the exaggerated facial expressions get tiresome rather quickly.    Yet if you settle into the right frame of mind - there's a lot to admire in \\"Nosferatu.\\" The highlight is actor Max Schreck as Count Graf Orlok. He's simply repulsive. Unlike the modern versions of vampires as charming seducers, Schreck's Orlok is a monstrosity. He's a hideous skeletal being with long bony fingers, ears like a bat, and fangs that look like they belong on an oversized rodent. There's nothing enchanting about him.    He's creepy. Very creepy. The famous shot of him rising up out of coffin - filled with soil from the graveyard of Black Death victims - his body stiffand straight - and it's easy to understand why the film has lasted more than eight decades.    Murnau accomplished a lot with his limited resources. He expertly uses light and shadow. In fact, Schreck's shadow could be considered another character in the film. And there are marvelous symbols scattered throughout the film: from a skeleton clock to the Venus Fly trap eating a bug. Murnau is able to cobble together a compelling narrative with few dialog cards, allowing, for the most part, the action to unfold.    But like any horror movie, the real question is: Is \\"Nosferatu\\" scary?    The answer, unfortunately, is: hardly.    By today's standards, the film would have a difficult time scaring a five year old. It has eerie moments - and Schreck is in most of them - but it's a tame ride for anyone who has watched John Carpenter's \\"Halloween\\" or Stanley Kubrick's \\"The Shining.\\" Amazingly, the film was banned for \\"excessive horror\\" in Sweden until 1972.    \\"Nosferatu\\" remains an oddity, a film any serious horror aficionado should watch in order to understand the origins of the genre. The film's greatest impact may have been in bringing the world the concept of sunlight killing vampires. \\"Nosferatu\\" is the source material for that bit of legend.    Watch it, but don't expect too much. The hype and the legend around \\"Nosferatu\\" are much better than the actual film.    Like literate blather about films?

1591841984|3.0|\\"I want to put a ding in the universe.\\"    \\"Inside Steve's Brain\\" by Leander Kahney is one of a very few books on Steve Jobs, the founder of Apple. The author wrote about the life of Steve Jobs and his role in Apple and how he started a company, got boot out of the company, got in again, and changed the world's lifestyle.    Content    1. Focus: How Saying \\"No\\" Saved Apple    2. Despotism: Apple's One-Man Focus Group    3. Perfectionism: Product Design and the Pursuit of Excellence    4. Elitism: Hire Only A Players, Fire the Bozos    5. Passion: Putting a Ding in the Universe    6. Inventive Spirit: Where Does the Innovation Come From?    7. Case Study: How It All Came Together with the iPod    8. Total Control: The Whole Widget    This book is apparently not the typical business book but let's compare it with the ideal business book; a book that is \\"easy to understand, distinct, practical, credible, insightful, and provides great reading experience.\\"    Ease of Understanding: 7/10: Being a news editor for WIRED, Leander Kahney made it very easy to understand the life of Steve Jobs and Apple. However, the bad point of this book is that stories are repetitive. The story of \\"Apple II\\" is in most chapters as well as stories of iMac, iPod, etc. By trying to tie those stories with characteristics of Steve Jobs (as in the title of each chapter), stories of different products and people are scattered all over the book.    Distinction: 5/10: The business biography of successful businessmen is anything but new. However, there are very few options of the stories of Steve Jobs.    Practicality: 4/10: This book is not practical in a sense that not everyone can be Steve Jobs. The author also did not give us ideas that readers could apply to our lives. The \\"Lessons from Steve\\" at the end of each chapter are just what Steve Jobs did and succeed; they are not what you can and should do.    Credibility: 6/10: The title of the book \\"Inside Steve's Brain\\" is misleading. The book isobviously not written by Steve Jobs himself. Analyses, interpretations, thoughts, and assumptions by the author are sound but they are still unconvincing. It is doubtful and inevident that how accurate they actually resonate Steve's thoughts.    Insightful: 8/10: This is the best aspect of this book; the author had a long list of researches, interviews, findings on Steve Jobs and Apple. It might be an overstatement but you can find interesting facts or interviews in almost every page of the book. That is truly remarkable and Steve Jobs himself might not be able to put together these pieces of information like Leander Kahney.    Reading Experience: 6/10: Well, this book is not like listening to Steve Jobs in Macworld. It was more like having a conversation with a vivid and passionate Steve Jobs and Apple fan who kept saying \\"Apple is a magic, the rest are rubbish.\\"    Overall: 6/10: If you want to know more about Steve Jobs or you love your Apple products; buy \\"Inside Steve's Brain\\". There is no other recent option.

B0009MAP9A|5.0|I am amazed by people who attempt to stereotype creative genius. Because this album takes on a distinctly different (more ominous, brooding, cutting) mood from the first two albums, they regard it sub-standard! Even in the classic 'Rolling Stone Record Guide' of 1983, the 'critic' failed to appreciate this album, giving it a meagre three stars because he felt its lyrics over-critical and dated. Yet I listen to this album in 2008, 25 years later, and am still moved, and deeply so, by the universality of the subject matter - to say nothing of the music itself. It is, after all, by induction that we generalise from the particular - something that Dylan the bard is brilliant at achieving in his tales. (In just the same way, the critics, and those they influence, miss the boat by regarding 'Live at Budokan' as awful because Dylan had the impertinence to re-interpret his own songs!) 'The times...' (and 'Budokan')are both as exquisite as any of the albums traditionally regarded as Dylan's best.
B001152TL6|4.0|I disagree with the opening line of the Amazon Editorial review which says \\"Plot is a meaningless term when trying to describe Lost Highway\\".  Frankly that's the answer for lazy people who don't like thinking as part of their movie-watching.  [SPOILER (kinda) ALERT] The plot is an answer to a question: How do people deal with a reality so horrific they can't face it?    Also, if you've never seen a David Lynch film, you'll see that the anngles, the colors, the elements and scale in the shots, are all part of his mood setup and are jsut as important to what he's going for as the story is.
0316017922|5.0|Rehearsed, choreographed, and perfected talent coupled with ambition and a healthy dose of luck is the perfect cocktail for success according to Malcolm Gladwell.  In \\"Outliers,\\" Gladwell shows just how individuals who hone their skills, arrive on the scene at just the right time, and leverage relationships rise to prominence in their respective careers.  He delves into the factors facilitating success.  It is a timely subject intimately sought by those seeking to uncover whatever \\"it\\" is that catapults some individuals to success and leaves most others stuck on the launch pad.    In a world we only recently learned was flat, every advantage, not surprisingly, is sought by every individual in every country.  Gladwell writes an impressive new chapter in the classic debate regarding the importance of nature versus nurture.  Recent similar works have added to the knowledge base, such as \\"Talent is Overrated,\\" \\"The Bell Curve,\\" and \\"The Snowball.\\"  All help to illustrate the necessity, and differing faces, of life advantages. The power of compounding, which Einstein remarked \\"the human mind cannot comprehend,\\" is applied to life advantages; whether earned or not, propel the ready in life to greatness.  And guess what?  These outliers typically have had not only superior ability in whatever their chosen fields, but not surprisingly the \\"secret\\" of their success is the superior combination of ability (through intense practice), opportunity, and luck.  The old adage of \\"no one does it alone\\" comes up in the work time and again.      Gladwell cites a great example in youth hockey league leading to NHL superstars.  Players born closest to the new year in hockey league registration are included in the same group as those born on Dec. 31st of the same year.  This essentially gives some boys up to a year's worth of growth, cognitive skill development, and agility over another player born later in the calendar year.  The \\"early birds\\" are consequently believed to better playersby their coaches, given additional training, and proportionally develop into the largest cohort of NHL stars.  Pretty interesting, Wiki some of your favorite players and you'll see the trend.  This example could just have easily been expanded to include school registration, ballet, art, driver's education or a host of other activities based on the age registration system.    \\"Outliers\\" amalgamates a series of vital factors, probably no more than a half dozen, that ultimately seem to determine exponential success from mediocrity.  If one was to look at a bell curve, the vast majority of humanity naturally falls in the belly.  Only on the extreme tails do we find the aptly termed outliers.  Although few, these variables Gladwell returns to frequently appear to be vital (this shouldn't shock anyone who has taken the time to study the composition of many professional career fields and their respective superstars, noted authors, leading woman, industry leaders, or top experts.)     To identify and concentrate perceived talent from a handful of blue chip institutions whose degrees lend themselves to a \\"halo effect\\" pedigree, which leads to what Gladwell describes as \\"accumulative advantage,\\" the classic aphorisms start to rear their ugly heads now. \\"It takes money to make money,\\" \\"Like father like son,\\" and a host of not-so politically correct sayings emerge.  And there's the rub, like the Indian caste system.  Who could then honestly deny that a not-so-invisible caste system exists and persists?  Which in my opinion gets to heart of Gladwell's work.      Probably the most actionable part of \\"Outliers\\" is our ability, as a society, to find, develop, and unleash the untold talent that walks amongst us.  It is this talent whose benefit to society can be enjoyed by all--from the phenomenal music of the Beatles to the writing of John Irving.  And there is where I have one fault, or better put, omission in  \\"Outliers.\\"  I will call it the \\"Gattaca Factor,\\" after the aptly named movie.  There is little mention of the struggle, misery and failure that builds a tenacious hunger for success.  I argue that this trait is probably why so many successful business entrepreneurs and performance artists don't have formal educational degrees; scripted success blocked their potential for the proverbial \\"luck,\\" instead they sought it out of their own accord.  There plenty of these examples to cement the belief that anything is possible, even if every advantage wasn't afforded to you.

B00154GEFU|5.0|I have been a fan of Asia since the early 80's and have just purchased their new CD Phoenix. I can tell everyone this and it is great to listen to real muscians, not the de sensitised so called music of todays generation of mindless rap crap and its off shoots. I am not saying there is not great muscians today but I don't feel they get to bring forth there talents as muscians of the 70 & 80's.<br /><br />This new CD from Asia has the sound and sophistacation from these true muscians. This collection purely broght back memories of an age gone past, this age could do much good in its re surgence.<br /><br />Sit back and indulge yourself in this age less collection. I hope there will be further colaberations from these talented muscians

It proved to us what a great president and friend we all had in Abraham Lincoln, and what he did not just for this country but for mankind in general.

B001EOQWEO|5.0|Wall-E, at the very least, is easily Pixar's best effort.  Though in actuality, the highest and most accurate praise I can give this humble little film is this: It's not only the best animated feature since [[ASIN:B00003CXB4 The Lion King]], it also earns an easy place as one of the top five animated films of all time.    Wall-E balances an innocent romance with a story about realization, companionship, and heroism in a way that will both entertain and challenge children, all the while completely engaging adults in both the story and the potent but never pushy social message. The movie manages multiple laugh out loud moments with minimal dialogue, and instead allows the robots to communicate with each other and humans with robotic sounds that are so well done that they're as understandable as any real speech used in the movie.  The lead robots, Wall-E and EVE are great characters with a story that can and will warm your heart and glaze your eyes one minute and make you crack up the next.  There are hardly any B-Plots except recurring jokes (the \\"Foreign Contaminate\\" robot bit comes to mind), so pretty much the full length of the movie is devoted to Wall-E's epic journey to restore humanity on Earth and, moreover, to hold EVE's hand.    The design of the robots in this movie is nothing short of genius.  They are highly emotive and more expressive than most of the humans, though it's clear that Pixar made the effort to achieve a balance, making sure that they're expressive but also retain the man-made machinery look.  And it was a complete success.  There are many scenes of simple staggering beauty here, such as Wall-E, fire extinguisher in hand, flying with EVE through open space.  From the regular character design, to the deep and starry sky, to the buildings, to the fast paced action scenes, to the sleek look of EVE, to the masterpiece that is Wall-E himself, Pixar completely and totally outdid themselves.    Wall-E is an ambitious idea that has been fully realizedin an unabashed masterpiece of a film.    10/10 Classic.
B001ACH4DS|5.0|I have to agree with the other positive reviews, so I don't have much more to add. Quite simply, this album is awesome & exactly the kind of music I had hoped for & expected from David Cook. I love it! I'm already looking forward to future albums.

It is so worth owning and the price is wonderful for such a treasure.

B001F290E4|5.0|One of the mistakes that these so called reviewers make is rating each song as better or worse than the original version.  Seal puts his on stamp on each and that is what makes each song so good. When I heard his version of \\"Walk on by\\", I did not like it. Now after listening to it over and over, Dionne Warwick's take on it seems lacking.  Cut the guy some slack - each one of his CDs has had its own flavor and I appreciate the effort that it must take to redfine his style each pass through the recording studio.  The biggest mistake a recording artist can make (in my opinion) is to crank out the same predictable stuff.  With Seal you never know what to expect.  He could record Disney's \\"Its a Small World\\" and make it sound sweet!

B0009MDPYM|4.0|I am a person that is not at all familiar with the source material that Constantine is drawn from. I also read some other reviews here and found them mostly not helpful as they are dominated by fans of the graphic novels(?) picking at details that most people won't ever notice (like me).<br /><br />Constantine is what I call a great versus movie. One guy against big odds trying to find a way to win. In this case, it's one man versus Hell and Heaven (Hell mostly) trying to stop the end of the world. Doesn't get much bigger than that odds-wise. The main character has all kinds of flaws to overcome, and that makes you pull for him even more. The story is well told, but can be a little heavy on the obscure biblical dialogue. I found myself rewinding here and there to hear some of the more obscure points revealed in the story. This is a small complaint because the monologues do fit with the vibe of the story, so just think of them as added atmosphere. The effects are all excellently done, and the visual style is both creepy and beautiful in equal measure. This is a better film than many gave it credit for when it was released. If you enjoy an atmospheric action thriller, with a bit of horror and fantasy thrown in, then this is the flick for you.
B001GQACGO|5.0|Of course I knew this would be a very controversial CD regarding reviews because Beyonce is the most versatile, multitalented artist of her time which no one with a heartbeat can deny.  She has been dubbed justifiably, a triple-threat, Queen B, hotest chick in the game and the been voted men's most desirable female artist.  She continues her mystic in this double CD collection which truly exhibits her pop, R&B, dance and hip-hop appeal.  The great thing about this offering is that there is something on it for everyone, which expresses her ability to channel almost any persona that she wishes to project.     The singles that have dropped Single Ladies, If I Were A Boy, truly exhibit her desire to express the feelings women share about life, love and relationships.  Without a doubt she has plenty of material to exploit as she promotes this project through video's and with her incredible ability to demonstrate the true essence of a song there is no doubt that this will be well received. She is constantly evolving and projecting life's circumstances through her music and she has done an excellent job of concocting a splendid recipe in which to choose.  She is an ultra DEEEEVA. I enjoy most of the songs on this package today and it is the type of project that will grow on you until you will appreciate all the songs for different reasons.
0778321606|5.0|There's a little yarn shop on Blossom Street in Seattle. It's owned by Lydia Hoffman, and it represents her dream of a new life free from cancer. A life that offers a chance at love...<br /><br />Lydia teaches knitting to beginners, and the first class is \\"How To Make a Baby Blanket.\\" Three women join. Jacqueline Donovan wants to knit something for her grandchild as a gesture of reconciliation with her daughter-in-law. Carol Girard feels that the baby blanket is a message of hope as she makes a final attempt to conceive. And Alix Townsend is knitting her blanket for a court-ordered community service project.<br /><br />These four very different women, brought together by an age-old craft, make unexpected discoveries --- about themselves and each other. Discoveries that lead to friendship and more...<br /><br />This book was wonderful!!! Each of the characters were so different, you would never put them together but Ms. Macomber does in a way that is not only very believeable but touching as well. Four unlikely women in a class where they not only learn to knit a baby blanket, they knit together a friendship as well. Jacqueline hates her new daughter in law and is having trouble with her spouse, she hopes knitting this blanket will help her feel more bonded to her soon to be grandbaby. She intially holds herself above the rest of the group. Alix is an odd fit because of her dyed hair, attitude and leather. She joins because she is trying to fill community service hours, but is secretly trying to get some nurturing she never had growing up. Carol wants a baby so bad and this is her last chance at invitro, she has given up so much for a chance at being a mother. And then there is Lydia, the owner of the shop and teacher. A cancer survivor, opening the shop is her \\"affirmation to life\\".<br /><br />Whether you knit or not, this book so enjoyable. While there is a lot of focus on knitting, as a non-knitter myself, I didn't find it distracting from the story. Knitters will love the free pattern for the baby blanket that the characters in the story are knitting. It may even inspire readers to take up knitting themselves. A very good, heartwarming read that I would recommend to anyone.e baby blanket that the characters in the story are knitting. It may even inspire readers to take up knitting themselves.

1932907009|4.0|You do have to take this with a grain of salt.<br /><br />I have just finished reading the provocative 1 star review by NO WAY. Yes, he is right, Save the Cat IS formulaic. But this can be helpful, as the formula is based on sound principles.<br /><br />I have used it as a guide to write my first screenplay and found it immensely helpful. (I have just begun marketing it - so wish me luck.) I have previously written a long Mythopoeic novel, have studied mythology and folklore (including Campbell) and so I recognized a lot of the underlying principles. Perhaps this helped me have a little perspective on it.<br /><br />As I see it - the formula is the the guide to the structure. You still need to have talent in writing. You may even be able to stray from the formula, but knowing it is really important.<br /><br />One thing I liked about the book is the author's sense of humor. To me, his style implied a bit of \\"don't take me TOO seriously.\\" I also like the way he discusses the ups and downs of the writer's process. For me, it was nice to know that I was not the only one going through the emotional roller-coaster.<br /><br />So - I recommend it highly. Just don't take it as the bible.

0374105235|4.0|A Long Way Gone is a memoir of Ishmael Beah's days as a child soldier in Sierra Leone. Some reviewers have questioned the accuracy of the details...I read this book with an open mind, realizing that this book details the author's memories of the events he experienced as a child soldier. Beah is a good storyteller, and effectively illustrates the horrifying reality of living in a country where the government is so vulnerable to rebel forces. The details are vivid, and at times, very difficult to read. I cannot fathom how traumatic it must have been to see so many people killed, and to be one of the killers. This is Beah's story, and the fact of the matter is that what happened to Beah is going on in other countries today, and everyone needs to be aware of it. This book should be required reading in middle and/or high school. An incredible story.
055357342X|4.0|Phew. I finished it. Who needs a 1200+ page novel? This cult favorite breaks every rule of the literary fiction/creative writing major/MFA crowd. It's got more characters than an ant hill has ants. A hundred story lines moving forward in a dizzying, incomprehensible maze. Names. Dates. Serial numbers. It's huge. Martin makes no attempt at creating a beginning, middle and end to this multi-volume epic--not to the whole thing or any volume. He just ends the thing--probably when he couldn't lift the manuscript any more--leaving threads untied, tales unfinished. Readers drooling.<br /><br />My editors and writing coaches would ring their hands at this monster. But they haven't sold like Martin does, and they haven't created a very large jewel like this, either.<br /><br />I loved it and started the next volume immediately. I'm not even done with that, and I'm asking my daughter, \\"Wasn't there a sequel on the way?\\" \\"Did you say there's a chapter to be downloaded?\\"<br /><br />It's addictive and I'm addicted. No one can describe pageantry or create an imaginary world like Martin.<br /><br />I gave the book 4 stars rather than 5 because of the publisher's cruelty to the reader. Packing this mother around was painful. It could be marketed as a form of exercise or maybe even a weight loss program. It's just too big. Why couldn't they have packaged it into two 600+ page books rather than this gigantic phone book? And why the submicroscopic print in the mass paperback versions? Please, you've got addicts, treat them nicely.<br /><br />I'm midway through book 4 of the series and expect to wait, panting, for the next volume. [[ASIN:0976280922 Numenon (Bloodsong) (Bloodsong)]]
B001B1R1HC|5.0|The previous reviewer has given a creditable version of the standard high recommendation for Richter, and yet as great as Richter undoubtedly was -- he had no equal in the last century except Rachmaninov -- there are some things to consider before jumping into a 14-CD box set. I'd like to offer a few incidental points, not a complete review.<br /><br />Richter was the most original, imaginative Beethoven interpreter that I know of, but EMI's handful of sontas doesn't do his reputation full justice. One has to search through his multitude of live performances to get the real magic. I'd start with Music and Arts' collection of sonatas played in concert over a long span, and also BBC Legends' various CDs of recitals Richter gave on tour in London, many of which contain at least one Beethoven sonata, a few Bagatelles, or set of variations.<br /><br />EMI's Schubert and Schumann selections are closer to first-rate Richter, but again there are a number of live readings that are better. I'd look to Praga's massive collleciton of Richter's recitals regularly given at the Prague Festival over the years, along with various small independent labels. (Olympia's out-of-print catalog duplicates Praga's, I believe -- used copies are readily found at Amazon Marketplace.)<br /><br />As for the various concertos with Maazel, they've also been gathered in a bargain two-fer by EMI and are very much worth having. The Brahms Second, however, isn't a match for Richter's famous account with Leinsdorf and the Chicago Sym. on RCA. The Grieg and Schumann concertos with von Matacic, especially the Grieg, are not to be missed.<br /><br />The Handel keyboard suites are aggressively played and recorded in hard, ugly sound. Although they are famous, I can listen to about half of one at a time, if at all. The unsuspecting should know that these suites are for two keyboards; Richter's equally fierce partner is Andrei Gavrilov.<br /><br />Another favorite partner was the violinist Oleg Kagan, who died young. They made many recordings together that can be found on independent labels -- the peformances here are a small but inspiring sample. The Schubert \\"Trout\\" Quintet with the Borodins is lovely but at times eccentric; it's been hard to find in he U.S. until now. Finally, we get a great partnership with Fischer-Dieskau singing Brahms's unfamiliar song cycle 'Die Schone Magelone,' but I doubt that casual listeners will make it rhough the entire recital -- none of these are among Brahms's greatest lieder.<br /><br />I hope this helps to put EMI's big box set into perspective.  Richter was an indispensable artist, and those of us who cherish him are willing to hunt and peck through literally hundreds of scattered live recordings. That's the best way to get to know a pianist who shunned the recording studio and in general was suspicious of the decadent capitalist West. If you don't want to go on an extended safari, this release is an automatic recommendation, much to be preferred over the aging Richter heard on Philips' \\"Ricther the Master\\" series.gether that can be found on independent labels -- the peformances here are a small but inspiring sample.

B001FB4W0W|5.0|Nay sayers don't know what they are missing. While I did enjoy the first three books of Charlaine Harris' series, I think Alan Ball has done a terrific job interpreting the books for us and putting his own spin on things.This is a grown up Twilight, so don't expect a lot of beating around the bush as far as sex and violence are concerned.    The central stories are two fold: The serial murders of women who \\"associate\\" with the newest minority in America, the Vampires and the love story of 25 year old telepathic barmaid Sookie Stackhouse and the 172 year old Vampire and Civil War Veteran, Bill Compton.    The show also delves in the notion of acceptance and bigotry in a new and unique light. It gives us a fresh look at notions of racism and inequality. I love it.    Let me say that the series, now about to finish Sunday night (11-23-08) is fantastic. I hope they release the DVDs soon. Stephen Moyer and Anna Paquin light up the screen with their story. The peek inside the world of Vampires is fascinating and Alex Skarsgard as Eric is fantastic. Well worth your time to check out on On Demand if you haven't yet and well worth the investment for the DVD set.
0316017922|5.0|Most books about the extremely successful, the \\"Outliers\\" of the title, start from birth or childhood and work forward.  Gladwell's latest book starts with the successful individual and works backward, to surroundings of childhood, quirks of timing with birth, and on to parents and earlier ancestors.<br /><br /> In doing this, he is attempting two things.  The first is to demonstrate that an entire genre of \\"how to succeed like x\\" biography is misplaced, or at least incomplete.  Instead of discussing how to emulate the many characteristics that, say, a person like Bill Gates possesses (smarts, ambition, etc.), the most important step is often left unsaid: be born into a family and circumstances like Bill Gates was.  This aspect of the book is Gladwell at his best.  Gladwell is more of a master storyteller than a researcher.  My favorite parts of Blink and The Tipping Point were the stories of individuals Gladwell used to illustrate his theses.  If anything, he focuses on individual stories to a greater degree in Outliers, and this makes the book fast reading and entertaining while remaining thought provoking.<br /><br />Gladwell's second goal is more ambitious.  He starts from the supposition that circumstances of birth and ancestry have a huge influence on success.  From there he seeks to uncover ways in which we can manipulate our surroundings to make success more likely.  This is ultimately not as successful (although still entertaining), and it is where Gladwell's limitation as more of an aggregator of others' research may be apparent.  This lack of primary research will put off some readers, but, since Gladwell never claims that this is a meta-analysis for a peer reviewed journal, I think that is judging the book by the wrong standard.<br /><br />I find Outliers to be a well-done example of a genre (think Freakonomics, Sway) that uses a combination of anecdote and hard science to both entertain and to provoke thought.  If, after a book like this, I am able to examine everyday phenomena in a new way afterward, I consider the book a success.<br /><br />4.5 stars.na in a new way afterward, I consider the book a success.      4.5 stars.
B001DTPZNY|2.0|Ugh, not a good movie. I was thoroughly disappointed on the whole with the new Indiana Jones movie and was glad that I only saw it via dvd rental.    Yes, the action was good and non-stop as to be expected, but the storyline wasn't even good. The previous three Indiana Jones movies had a pleasant balance of both action and storyline, but not this one.     Also, the action scenes seemed to be down almost entirely of CG/computer graphics and the CG looked so fake and unreal, which was another let down while watching this movie. I'd have thought with all the technology out there today, that the CG would have been a lot better quality... I guess I thought wrong.

The one opportunity for redemption falls flat, as there's no real change after the press conference.  The romantic interest is forced and uncomfortable.  You have to sit through two hours of tepid \\"build-up\\" before Iron Man actually battles a bad guy.  Let's hope this is the last we see from this group.
0061170623|5.0|I agree with the reviewer, G. Guthrie, that this is one of the rare occasions when an audio version of a novel may be better than the original.  Or at least more accessible.<br /><br />Tom Hollander, a native of England, brings to life the \\"Nadsat\\" language created by Anthony Burgess.  All difficulty of pronunciation, as one might find in reading silently, is erased by the perfect and fluid language gifts of Mr. Hollander.<br /><br />Alex, and his \\"droogs,\\" and his parents, and his \\"Post-Corrective Advisor, P. R. Deltoid,\\" etc., are captured in all their uniqueness by the voice of Tom Hollander.  In my opinion, this would not be possible in reading \\"A Clockwork Orange\\" on one's own.<br /><br />Of course the basic text is just plain entertaining and very funny in a caustic sort of way.  So one cannot go wrong by reading alone.<br /><br />In listening to this audio version of \\"A Clockwork Orange\\" by Tom Hollander, I often thought of the acting performance of Malcolm McDowell, who so brilliantly played Alex in Stanley Kubrick's film version of \\"A Clockwork Orange\\" in 1971.  I doubt that even Malcolm McDowell could have done as well as Tom Hollander has done on this audio.<br /><br />I give it five stars, and highly recommend it, even if you own and have read the novel.<br /><br />\\"What's it going to be then, eh?\\"<br /><br />Raymond P.

The fact that his music appeals to a large group of people, spanning all ages, and crosses over from Rock to Pop demonstrates the versatility of this album.  Highly recommend!

B000RPTQ1C|1.0|I will never buy another Coldplay album without hearing it first. This is the best example of a \\"DBB\\" (download it before buying it) album. I can understand how a band should evolve and not repeat themselves. From The Beatles to Depeche Mode we have seen bands changing their style album after album but STILL each album is great. Tough I didn't expect another A Rush of Blood album I sure expected great melodies or complex arrangements. None of this is found here. Sure, \\"VIVA LA VIDA\\" is one of the greatest songs of this years and one of Coldplay's best, but do we have to go all through an album of dull \\"songs\\" just to have one or at the most 2 great songs?? I can't believe this is the same Brian Eno that produced such gems with Bowie and Talking Heads. I guess a producer can't do much when the artist lacks completes inspiration. What a waste.
B001GQACGO|5.0|A few months prior to the release of this album, Beyoncé's third, she appeared on the cover of Marie Claire magazine expressing her interest to move past pop star status in favor of becoming an icon.  On \\"I Am...Sasha Fierce,\\" Beyoncé steps closer to achieving that goal, while flexing her creative muscles in the process.    While the general populace have come to recognize the 27-year-old starlet for her soul-infused top 40 uptempos, few are unaware of the fact that Beyoncé, unlike many of her contemporaries, is truly gifted with a powerful and expressive  voice.  This voice is well served by many of the tracks on the album, both on the ballad-heavy first disc and the dance-driven second disc.  Songs such as \\"Broken-Hearted Girl\\" and \\"Smash Into You\\" introduce listeners to a softer side of the artist, while \\"Radio\\" and \\"Hello\\" provide a pleasantly familiar Beyoncé experience.    Though Knowles risks boring listeners by separating the ballads from the uptempos, she really is talented enough to keep listeners entertained with introspective lyrics and some truly entertaining vocal acrobatics.  She gets her point across well, sounding equal parts jubilant, vulnerable, and boastful throughout the album's 16 tracks (18 if you were savvy enough to pre-order \\"Save the Hero\\" and \\"Why Don't You Love Me,\\" some of Beyoncé's best material to date).    Those critical of her decision to include nearly 20 tracks on the album would do well to consider the possibility that there are also those who appreciate Beyoncé's decision to provide her audience with a fresh sound that spans a variety of musical soundscapes, both acoustic and electronic.  It is simply not possible to please everyone, and it is evident that Knowles has worked arduously to keep herself from being pigeonholed.      Don't sleep on: \\"Halo,\\" \\"Disappear,\\" \\"Sweet Dreams,\\" \\"That's Why You're Beautiful\\"

0316017922|5.0|Malcolm Gladwell is a wonderfully original writer. His ability to take the academic research of others and translate it into fascinating individual stories , to in doing so create memorable social concepts is one of a kind. Here he examines the stories of people of extraordinary achievement, somewhat like himself. He calls them by the awkward name 'outliers' and compares them to a freezing cold day in August in Paris, something so rare it tempts us to seek explanation for it. In his previous works he had focused more on the individual cases, but here he studies the social background, the historical time, the communal factors which lead to the production of Bill Gates and Bill Joy, to a batch of first - rate hockey players, to top New York proxy lawyers, to super- proficient Asian - mathematics students, to the musical genius, Beatles, to the physics genius,Robert Oppenheimer.  He does not isolate any single factor but does focus on the importance of being born at the right time( The special nine years in which a group of superrich American business- people were born, the nineteen- fifties in which the Computer revolution was developing, ) of practicing and working hard ( He uses the Daniel Levitin idea that it takes ten- thousand hours of practice, three hours a day for ten years  to become ready). He emphasizes again and again that those born outside the worlds of opportunity, despite their genius and talent simply do not make it.<br />In a way he provides a recipe which is just right for the time we have entered, a time of great economic crisis, a time after a period of super- individualism in which there is a new need to focus on building social capitol, to providing infrastructure repair. He is really then implicitly providing a kind of message to the new Obama government of the need to shift priorities and invest in creating an America where more will have that opportunity to be the 'outliers' the great innovators and creators of the future.<br />So this is a timely book, an enjoyable book as all Gladwell's writing is enjoyable.<br />But that said the fundamental thesis itself is a very narrow and limited one. It is of course necessary to be in the right place at the right time. Periclean Athens is better than Sparta after the Pelopennesian War. Renassiance Italy is certainly better for a plastic artist than let us say eighteenth century Italy. It is also better to work hard than not if one is to refine one's skill. And of course if one has never seen a math book in one's life one will not become a math genius. Still his explanations provide necessary factors but not sufficient or really explanatory ones in regard to genius. After all there are thousands and thousands who are born in the necessary conditions.<br />Gladwell's formula for success is too narrow. And in fact even within the parameters he chooses it raises question. It is wonderful that Asians who come from a rice- culture can calculate numbers faster and score higher in general in Math, but in fact the great geniuses of Math History to this point do not come from East Asia. One can calculate Mozart's practice - hours and somehow arbitrarily come to ten- thousand. Did Mendelsohn too , who produced some of his greatest works when under twenty also practice just ten- thousand hours?<br />All in all Gladwell does upon up in an interesting way a whole new face to the discussion of great accomplishment. But the traditional searching at the individual life and genius are still I would bet the most productive ways of understanding why for instance one Newton in 1666 came to make in one annus mirabilis a whole set of fundamentally new understandings of the natural world- and one Einstein in 1905 came to make his own grabbag of fundamental discoveries which transformed the understanding of the natural world.<br />At the top of the ladder on the highest rung there is only one.

B001ACH4DS|5.0|You can see from my screen name that I like Clay Aiken.  I love a pure, well controlled voice.  I just wish Clay's producers would fight harder for him to sing something other than the schmatltzy pap they give him.    Now David Cook?  There's a voice I can get behind and this is a record I can back, too.    I'm listening to the album as I type this - Bar-ba-sol - and it's all I can do to sit still at the computer and not jump up and find the nearest stripper pole for a little bump and grind.  I heard David say in an interview that he tested the songs he chose for their ability to be played live.  I, for one, cannot WAIT to dance, laugh, sing along and generally rock out to every single song, especially A Daily AntheM.    Permanent has a special place in my heart.  First of all, Cook literally rips open his chest and allows us to hold his heart in our hands for nearly 3 minutes.  Second, the subject matter is poignant.  Third, I see/read a much higher meaning into the lyric and think it could be the rallying anthem for the terminally ill community and their loved ones.  If you download just one song, try this one.    And, having said that, I can think of three more that should be monster, whopping hit records - Barbasol, Lie and Kiss on the Neck (a bonus track).      If you like rock, but in a Midwest kind of way, go for this album.
B00008EPMD|4.0|This is one of my favourite albums by ELP. It actually tells a story, of sorts, so is a loose concept album. It is also the album where everybody got introduced to HR Giger's fantastic artistic concept of \\"biomechanical\\" beings, a melding of man and machine. which would later be used in the movie Alien.<br /><br />There are a couple of wankers here that we could do without, but if you listen with the right amount of tongue in biomechanical cheek, you'll live. Overall, though, there is some amazing journeys through various styles of rock, jazz, fusion and pop music that just can't be beat.
0312427646|4.0|This will be a very short synopsis because at only 128 pages, if I give you any more than a couple of sentences, it will end up longer than the book itself.<br /><br />Quite by accident, the Queen of England (yes, that Queen) stumbles upon the bookmobile that visits Buckingham Palace each week. To be polite, she checks a book out from the traveling library and what follows is an adorable story in which HRH develops quite an obsession with books and sends the palace into an uproar.<br /><br />Written from the Queen's perspective, this novella is both charming and witty. Watching the Queen's progress as she begins her literary explorations is, in it's own way, inspiring. She starts out as most of avid readers do, picking and choosing books based on interest. As she becomes more accomplished, she begins taking notes and venturing her own thoughts on reading. Her new hobby becomes a full-time obsession and hilarity ensues as the Queen's reading begins to interfere with her royal duties.<br /><br />But aside from the quaintness of the story, there is also some serious philosophical musings on why we read, why we chose to read what we do, and the myriad of ways reading can determine one's character. There's a lot more to this novella than first meets the eye. And the ending ... well, suffice it to say that the ending is a puzzle-perfect fit.<br /><br />This is a wonderful choice for a gift book for the reader in your life. To be honest, the sticker price somewhat baffled me: I thought the MSRP of $12.00 a bit steep for this small novella, but perhaps I'm out of touch. And of course you can get it for less here at Amazon, too.  Very sweet book ... I do recommend it.

Secondly Brisinger has gone off the deep end in detailed descriptions of everything from every blade of grass that moves to each spatter of blood in the battles.  The author has endevored to remove all imagination from the reader.  He has even included chapters with no appearent purpose, (\\"Glumra\\") for instance.

0525478183|5.0|Quentin Jacobsen (called \\"Q\\" by his buddies) believes everybody gets one miracle. His just happens to be living next door to the girl of his dreams, Margo Roth Spiegelman. Margo and Quentin go way back. Even when they were nine years old, Q thought she was the most perfect female on the face of the planet, and they played together in their Pleasantville-like Orlando subdivision. After they found a dead man in the park, Margo appeared outside his window at night to tell him she investigated the dead man. Her diagnosis of why he killed himself: \\"...all the strings inside him broke...\\"    Quentin and Margo are now high school seniors. They still live next door to each other but have drifted apart. Quentin is quite the low-key good citizen, while Margo is a true legend. She has learned to play guitar from an old guy in Hot Coffee, Mississippi, traveled with the circus and once maneuvered her way into a famous rock band's backstage gathering.    Prom, finals and graduation loom on the close horizon on what Quentin will call the longest day of his life. Prom is a big discussion in his circle. He is adamantly disinterested in it, but his two best buddies don't share his opinion. Radar will take his new girlfriend, Angela. Ben is frantic to go but has yet to find the right, agreeable \\"honeybunny.\\"    Quentin is distracted from the discussion when he spies Margo talking with her boyfriend, Jase. He is struck by the way she is laughing, with her mouth stretched wide, and gazing away from Jase. She seems to be staring at her friend Becca. As Quentin strolls nearer, he realizes she isn't really laughing but her mouth continues to remain wide open.    The rest of the day continues on as usual. Q watches the clocks in class and laughs at Ben's life goal (to be in the GUINNESS BOOK OF WORLD RECORDS for the \\"Most Honneybunnies Ever Pleased\\"). He commiserates with Radar when Angela wonders why she has never been invited to his house. Little does she know that Radar's parents own theworld's largest collection of black Santas --- a fact that causes Radar no end of humiliation.    In the evening, Quentin sticks to his usual routine. But his life turns on a dime that night when Margo opens his bedroom window to invite him on an all-night adventure, which turns out to be the most terrifying, thrilling and eye-opening event he ever could hope to experience. When it ends, he pays almost no attention to what Margo says as she hugs him: \\"I. Will. Miss. Hanging. Out. With. You.\\" His mind is too abuzz with the possibilities of their future relationship, and he's planning what he'll say to her the next day at school. But Margo doesn't show up, and it isn't long before Quentin realizes that not only has she vanished, she has left him clues as to what's become of her.    Quentin cannot resist the challenge. His obsession with finding Margo takes him for a wild road trip that leads to bizarre destinations, including deserted strip malls and abandoned housing developments. But his most unexpected discovery is what he finds within himself.    This gripping page-turner from Printz Medalist John Green (author of LOOKING FOR ALASKA and AN ABUNDANCE OF KATHERINES) is both hilarious and thought-provoking. Quentin is an appealing Everyman who manages to become a hero, yet nothing is ever quite as the reader might expect. The plot twists and turns, pulling us in as we careen toward the unpredictable and satisfying conclusion. Very highly recommended.        --- Reviewed by Terry Miller Shannon

0375826726|5.0|Still a boy and not yet a man, he is one of the greatest Dragon Riders and bravest of warriors. Eragon is on the edge of many discoveries and great changes. Though his sword has been taken by Murtagh, he still fights with the Varden against the madness of Galbatorix as they try to save the kingdom of Alagaesia. Shamed by the knowledge that he and Murtagh are brothers (both share Morzon for their father), he longs to understand more of his past. As a Dragon Rider, he continues to learn, to test himself and to push all of his limits with the help of Saphira. The beautiful, dangerous Saphira is only one of four dragons left. She is his constant companion. Without her, Eragon knows that he, like Galbatorix, would go mad. There is nothing they do not share --- or so he thinks.    \\"To know that you were with one who cared for you, and who understood every fiber of your being, and who would not abandon you in even the most desperate of circumstances, that was the most precious relationship a person could have, and both Eragon and Saphira cherished it.\\"    On the battlefield, always the unexpected happens. Sometimes his spells, his magic, his strength are enough to save them. Sometimes the soldiers of Galbatorix are more demon than man, and in one battle with his ally, King Orrin, they encounter the following:    \\"The man was a soldier of medium height, with a purple birthmark on his neck and brown hair plastered flat by the helmet he had been wearing. His shield was a splintered ruin. His sword was notched, bent, and broken, missing the last six inches. River mud caked his mail hose. Blood sheeted from a gash along his ribs. An arrow fletched with white swan feathers had the shaft buried in the hard dirt. From the man's throat, a horrid gurgling laugh emanated. It rose and fell with a drunken cadence, pitching from note to note as if the man were about to begin shrieking with horror.\\"    Though his cousin, Roran Stronghammer, has united with Katrina, he remains one of Eragon's true friends. Roran is not only brave but a natural leader. He proves himself time after time to be indispensable to Nasuada's armies. Still playful as boys, both Eragon and Roran are ready to sacrifice anything for their love of Alagaesia.    Despite all his successes as a great warrior, Eragon is in need of his most important weapon: his own sword. Not until a number of battles are fought, much blood shed and many sacrifices made does Eragon finally meet one of the most renowned of sword makers --- Rhunon-elda. This is where another story begins:    \\"A sword should feel like an extension of your arm, as if it had grown out of your very flesh. You shouldn't have to think about how you want it to move: you should simply move it as instinctively as an egret his beak or a dragon her claws. The perfect sword is intent incarnate: what you want, so it does.\\"    In this third book of the Inheritance Cycle, more surprising secrets are revealed and readers get even better acquainted with Selena Black Hand, Eldunari, Tamerlein, Glaedr, Oromis, Fairth, Memoa Trees, Snowfire, Ra'zacs, Urgals, scrying mirrors, crossbows, Carn, Nasuada, Trial of the Long Knives, Shrrgs, Elva, Solembum, Angela, spells, Arya, true names, Thorm and brisingr --- and so much more.    Christopher Paolini has developed his characters more deeply and brought an even greater intensity to the action throughout. Very helpful information is given at the end of the book on the origin of names, a pronunciation index and listings of languages from the ancient, the dwarf, the Nomad and the Urgal.    When readers are finished with BRISINGR, not only will they be dying for the next installment (they will probably want to read this one again just for fun), they undoubtedly will want a dragon --- especially one like Saphira.            --- Reviewed by Sally M.

0439023483|5.0|In my Teenreads.com review of THE SILENCED by James DeVita, I noted that we have a love of dystopian novels. I think it's because we, as humans, like to be right. We like to be able to make correlations between the conditions we see in the world and possible scenarios about how those conditions could achieve Worse Case Scenario status. It's frightening, really, that we should want to be right about that. Maybe it could be that we're glad other people (authors) seem to share our concerns about our direction --- as a civilization, as a country.    I admit: I'm a sucker for a good dystopian novel. In my mind, a GOOD dystopian novel doesn't settle for simply presenting a bleak set of circumstances and warning, \\"This is what could happen if we don't change our ways.\\" A GOOD dystopian novel forces us to become emotionally invested in the people who are affected by the bleak conditions. A GREAT dystopian novel goes a step further and makes us want more. THE HUNGER GAMES by Suzanne Collins, author of the Gregor the Overlander series, falls into this category.    The story is set in Panem, part of what used to be North America until an epic disaster rent civilization asunder into a chaotic tailspin. Rising from the ashes is the Capitol, a nightmarish totalitarian state, and 12 Districts kept under the painful thumb of the central Capitol government. The Capitol rules ferociously after an attempt at uprising several years earlier that resulted in the obliteration of a 13th District. To keep the remaining districts in line, the Capitol devised \\"The Hunger Games,\\" a brutal competition for which each district must supply two \\"players\\" (known as tributes) between the ages of 12 and 18. The 24 tributes fight to the last person standing in a wasteland-like arena where they compete for basic survival supplies while every moment is mandatory televised viewing for all citizens.    When her younger sister is randomly chosen to represent their district, Katniss Everdeen volunteers to take her place. She is sent to the Capitol with her district's other tribute, a baker's son named Peeta, where they are forced to participate in a macabre pageantry (complete with make-up artists and celebrity interviews) that leads up to the deadly games themselves. Once she enters the arena, Katniss must face her murderous fellow-tributes (some have been training for years in the event they were chosen) and decide if Peeta is an ally or an enemy. However, the decision seems to be a moot point because, as the rules stand, only one of them can emerge alive from the arena.    Collins's dystopia is somewhat old-fashioned --- mass, seemingly uncalculated oppression --- compared to more recent entries, such as LITTLE BROTHER, which is firmly grounded in a more clearly attainable reality. But I think the old-fashioned approach is part of the charm of this book (if, indeed, you can attribute the word \\"charm\\" to something that offers such a grim outlook). Collins crafts a vivid, frightening world where the citizens are worked to the point of exhaustion, starved to the point of collapse, and humiliated beyond the tolerance of any sane person for the entertainment of the elite. The heart of the book is the characters. Katniss is brave and caring, Peeta is smart and smitten. Anyone can scare readers by presenting a future devoid of hope, but it takes a skilled writer to create characters we dare to hope for. Collins has accomplished just that.    You'll be hearing a lot about THE HUNGER GAMES in the weeks and months to come, if you haven't already. There's good reason for that. If you're like me, you have an unrelenting pile of \\"to be read\\" books. Take my advice: nudge this one closer to the top.       --- Reviewed by Brian Farrey

B000009CEM|2.0|Hopelessly behind in my Fear Factory purchasing, I just got this one last week. I had loved everything up to this point with the exception for their techno/dance remixes that I had hoped they had tired of.  Thankfully none of that is here...but in it's place is a screaming that replaces the death metal growl that immediately sent up a red flag for me.     Then there is the rappish sound on the song \\"Edgecrusher\\" that is another strange moment for them. All this combined immediately puts them into the category of bands such as Korn, Corrosion Of Corformity, Helmet, Biohazard, and Prong. There are at least a couple songs on here where I thought for sure it was Korn and not FF playing to give an example, all those bands IMO are and were pretty good in their own right, but I really didn't expect to hear them on a FF release.  I know this was released in the summer of '98 and perhaps it was the sound of the times on radio and what record company's were pushing, but this is Fear Factory; not those above mentioned bands. But at some points it's hard to distinguish, and that is my problem with many of these songs on here. Some of the old Fear Factory sound is there, thankfully there are clean vocals still going through many of the songs. I am hoping my mind will open up to other songs on here other than a handful of favs as time goes by, really not sure.    One thing I was just thinking was that maybe they put too much into the story and tried to make it too accessible (toned it down)...maybe they wanted to fit in more with the sounds of the times.  I really don't like it when a band has a good sound that is pretty original and identiful, and then go and sound like everybody else just because they still aren't getting accepted by the mainstream. The reason you are not getting accepted is because alot of bad bands are being mass marketed to young kids and they are buying it up (disposable late 90's bands like Limp Bizkit, Linkin Park and hundreds of others trying to sound like Korn and even Fear Factory etc.)...I wanna say \\"dude's, stick to your guns, don't sink to their level!\\" All the one star reviews on this one really don't go into detail other than they obviously don't like it at all. Now it is not a good sign when you have fans of terribly unoriginal bands listening to and reviewing your CD, and hating it. So you tried to appeal to this crowd and they hate it, now what did we learn?  To me this experiment has failed.     Anyway, up to this point this is my least fav FF studio release by far. And I am skeptical on getting the next studio release, so this might be it for me. I can see where they were going next, and I'm going back and listening to the first couple CD's, perhaps they needed to also.     It may not sound like it, but there were some songs on there I liked quite well. I guess it shows how much I love(d) this band when even on a CD I don't like overall I find a few gems, right?      My top five fav songs here are  1. Securitron  2. Smasher/Devourer  3. Shock  4. Hi-Tech Hate  5. Resurrection.        Overall, not a horrible CD....just not what I expected, and they changed too much. Maybe if what they changed into was just a tad bit original and they invented something new, well yes it would be great; but this is just a step backward in the wrong direction.
B000002GQL|5.0|As the final installment of the Moody Blues' classic seven LPs, 1972's \\"Seventh Sojourn\\" reflects a very mature band. Comfortable with where they've been and how they make music, they ease back here on experimentation in favor of simpler melodies.    Make no mistake, though. This is a masterpiece, beginning to end. From Mike Pinder's social thought-provoking \\"Lost in a Lost World\\" to Justin Hayward's uplifting \\"New Horizons\\" to Ray Thomas' sea shanty \\"For My Lady\\" to John Lodge's tearful \\"Isn't Life Strange?\\" to Pinder's wartime conscientious objector tale in \\"When You're a Free Man\\" to Lodge's rockin' \\"I'm Just a Singer.\\"    I get the feeling they all decided to just be themselves this time, to say what was on their minds and in their hearts in one of those \\"I've always wanted to...\\" moments. It's as if they knew this would be the last of the lineup's greatness in sound.    As a result, the beauty of \\"Seventh Sojourn\\" is its simplicity, and especially cool are the transitional notes linking songs, notably \\"New Horizons\\" to \\"For My Lady\\" to \\"Isn't Life Strange?\\" You'll need to turn up the volume a bit to catch Thomas's flute tying \\"When You're a Free Man\\" to \\"I'm Just a Singer.\\"    In all, this album, like Phil Travers' cover art, reflects the band's unmatched talent for painting pictures through music.    For this Moody Blues fan, it doesn't get any better.
B001DHXT20|1.0|I saw this movie in theatres with my girlfriend 3 months ago and damn were we both disappointed! Forgive me but I see that I am not in the majority of the Hulk fans who actually loved the first movie directed by Ang Lee. And I'm not ashamed to admit it either! But this movie on the other hand was just GOD-AWFUL!!! I admit what with them picking Edward Norton to play Bruce Banner I had my doubts anyway! I mean come on the script and the acting were as big a travesty as was for Blade Trinity, the casting was completely better in concept, the action just couldn't measure up to the other movie, and there was just too many needless cameos. Don't get me wrong Edward Norton is a great actor and all but he's just not an action star. And as for his performance well he just phoned it in. Liv Tyler who's really friggin' hot and drop-dead gorgeous and who usually puts in a decent performance was just dreadful here. To say nothing of the fact that acting and performance wise she's just not the best replacement for Jennifer Connelly as Betty. And other than that she kept on talking with this unbearably corny orgasmic voice! Which the way she did it was more annoying than sexy. William Hurt just didn't make it as Betty's soldier father. And why did he act like he was severly constipated all through the movie. Somebody please get this guy some Metamucil! Sam Elliot I would say did a so-so job at that role. And Tim Roth who I'm a big fan  of(and have been since Rob Roy) was trying too hard to put in a performance unlike like his usual best which just blew up in his face! Tim just shouldn't be trying so hard and just be consistent with his usual best. It's was also a huge mistake the way the Incredible Hulk was portrayed. Why did they have to make him out to be really stupid and lacking in common sense?! The Incredible Hulk I know would not have run the opposite direction when he's being shot at. Yay! he threw the soldier vehicles towards them! Wake me up when he's done! The Hulk I know would have thrown them,knocked their blocks off,or he would have pounded the ground to send a big shockwave their way more than he did. Also when the Hulk and Betty are sitting on a cliff and they lightning on the horizon, why would he do something stupid like throw a rock at the lightning?! Alot of good that'll do!! LOL!! The brief cameo by Stan Lee was just pointless. I mean why would they show him drinking a beverage that Bruce Banner accidently bled in only to never show you what happened to him afterwards. Tim Blake Nelson was however enjoyable enough as the comic relief when he portayed the scientist who had access to Bruce's Hulk DNA. The only problem was after Tim Roth roughs him up to steal Bruce's superpowered DNA you don't get much of a sense what the radiation that was given off did to Tim Blake Nelson's character! Needless to say the only truly cool cameo was that of Lou Ferrigno's security guy. Lou will always be The Incredible Hulk to me! Now by the time Tim Roth finally becomes another kind of Hulk their fight just wasn't terribly exciting nor was it suspenseful. And come on rather than have an evil plan conceived as to what he would do once he changed other than destroy everything and try to kill The Hulk. Please!! So anyway if you're one of the few whom enjoyed Ang Lee's Incredible Hulk like I did or am just a big Hulk fan in general well then you're better off skipping this really bad raw sewage leak like the plague!
B000002KIE|5.0|whoa..454 reviews? is that a record? Well..seems pretty divided here...trash or genious? How bout genious trash? This disc is all about what good punk..or just good rock for that matter..is all about..emblematic of it's time,raw,pissed off,crunchy power chords and Chuck Berry guitar solos...with a flipped middle finger for good measure. The comparisons to bands like Green Day,etc...are way off base..you can't compare real punk with emo,pop-punk,power pop, whatever..it's not the same thing at all.There are certainly better musicians..better bands..better songwriters..but i seriously doubt there will be a band that better exemplifies the sheer, snarling,in yer face power that the Pistols did on this disc...and besides..most of the bands you guys are comparing with were influenced, directly or indirectly, by this very album.Respect yer elders!!!

B001ACH4DS|5.0|5 out of 5 Stars     I'm so glad to see David Cook the Songwriter return!  Those of us who have come to know his music know that this album is a continuation of a long personal journey that will last indefinitely, not a debut as the media would suggest.  What I have heard in this album is out of the box songwriting with a new sense of maturity, another stage in the evolution of David Cook, if you will. At this point, I am pretty familiar with Axium recordings and Analog Heart as well as the Idol tracks. An EW reviewer compared David to Daughtry. I only agree with the comparison in genres and the Idol path, but other than that, I can only compare David to David. The Rolling Stone reviewer dissed him for the influences of HIS idols. In my mind, these guys only added polish and the experience of massive exposure to David's already established rock sound. If anything, their influence has contributed to this eclectic piece of work. His Mr. Sensitive and A Daily AntheM continue the personal guitar driven sound I have come to love from him with his prior work. Permanent left me emotionally drained and if I had golden pipes like David, the story could have been mine! Bar-Ba-Sol and Mr. Sensitive needed no sandpaper, as the Entertainment Weekly reviewer suggested, because once again he brought raw to the edge but not over the edge. And as usual, Mr.Cook took Light On and Come Back to Me, songs written by others, and made them his own. So, we have witnessed David as a teenage phenom command the vocals, songwriting and guitar in Axium; then as a young adult, conviction and maturity added dimension to the songwriting and vocal qualities so ingeniusly exposed in Analog Heart; then on American Idol, we saw the interpretive phase of David's journey emerge as he had no choice but to sing the songs of others, and transcended musical genres while still being the guitar driven rock artist he is; and now, with DAVID COOK the album, we are witnessing the latest phase of the evolution, an adult David with years of songwriting behind him in a fresh batch of songs that stand up to or surpass any Idol's music I have heard and especially that of many of today's singer-songwriters. David's goals of creating a cohesive experience have been successful, so much so that I can't pick a favorite track.  Rock On, David. You are you, not Daughtry or Maida or Cornell, and you done good!
B00129H7VS|5.0|I have to say that this series blew me away. I was so impressed with the effort put into Saving Private Ryan to give it a documentary look and feel. Band Of Brothers falls from the same tree. Once again, Hanks and Spielberg reunite to produce this epic cable series of WW2 as told by the men themselves. Every episode has interviews from the soldiers who were there. Very realistic and emotional stuff.     First off, the set comes in a metal box with fold out style disk holders. Exactly like the standard dvd edtion a few years ago.     The Blu-Ray edition has 6 disks total. 2 episodes per disk on the first 5 with many, many extras on number 6.    The quality of the picture is perfect. These films were shot with tons of natural grain for that documentary style look. The lenses also give the look of a 40's camera used in the field. Although the film itself is washed out and very rough, it has awesome detail. You will notice so many things going on in the background. The size of the shots sometimes leave you in awe. The blacks are sometimes unstable, but that is the intent. The daytime scenes are beautiful in their full scope. The greatest thing about this series is the uncompromising attention to detail. From the uniforms to the weapons. The skintones are spot on and very nice looking with great detail. The majority of these episodes were shot outdoors. So, the landscapes look fantastic! From the coast of France, to the mountains of Austria, this has some amazing and beautiful scenery. While the picture may be \\" washed out \\", it looks and feels just as you would expect from the point of view from a combat photographer. The battle scenes are simply unbelievable. It takes you to a new level realism.      The sound is second to none. You will easily be blown away with the audio track quality. You have to turn down the volume at many points during battle scenes. The voices are crisp and clean, but the battle scenes really rock your sound system. All of your speakers get a good workout. The subwoofer really hammers out the explosions. The rear speakers have tons of gunfire from all directions, as do the side speakers. You will have a true surround sound experience. Many movies do not make full use of the full audio possibilities. This one does!    There are great extras here as well. Great in depth interviews from the soldiers themselves. A really cool making of documentary called \\" We stand together: The men of easy company \\" And many other things for the history buff. Cant say enough about this product. If you are a war genre lover, this is one of the best. If you love history, and dont want a watered down, made for Hollywood war film. This is how it happened as told by the men of the 506th E Co. You will have a new respect for these guys who gave so much. It is hard to believe that some people could give so much for so little. Thank god they did.
B001EOQWEO|1.0|I love the movie, but this dvd skips straight out of the box. There's not a scratch on it and it skips on both of my dvd players.
0316067601|3.0|I had this book recommended to me by several people and finally bought it and read it.  It is not as good as its fans want you to believe; nor as bad as its detractors would make it out.<br /><br />First, the book is adequately written, but is not going to make anybody's top 100 list.  It should be kept in mind that much of the credit or blame for the prose should probably be placed on the co-author Robinson, not Luttrel.  My own criticism was that the book often seemed heavily redundant and repetitive.  In most of those places, it was the repetition of the all liberals are the stupid, short-sighted, and ignorant henchmen of America's enemies theme which gave rise to that feeling.  Whether you agree or disagree with that sentiment is irrelevant.  The sentiment is one which only needed to be said once or twice to make the point.<br /><br />Second, despite the book's hammering of liberals (and their omnipresent media henchmen) as being responsible for preventing the military from doing their job, the book make's very clear that it was Luttrell's decision which led to the predicament that the members of Operation Redwing found themselves facing in Afghanistan.  Luttrell concedes that it was his decision to turn three unarmed Afghan tribesmen loose which led to hostile Taliban forces identifying his unit's location and attacking them.<br /><br />Moreover, Luttrell's telling of the story artificially limits Seal Team 10's options to three very poor decision alternatives which are all supposedly a direct result of liberal interference with the military's ability to kill unarmed non-combatants whenever military special forces units might deem such action necessary.  As Luttrell would have it, his team could either: (1) let the 3 unarmed shepherds go and wait for the inevitable Taliban attack; (2) kill the 3 shepherds and report it to their superiors and go to prison for murder later; or (3) kill the shepherds and deny it ever happened, but forever wait for the other shoe to drop and go to prison for murder sometime down the road.<br /><br />While personally sympathetic to the idea that U.S. rules of engagement can be unnecessarily restrictive and stupid, even I don't see any reason that Seal Team 10's options were restricted to this Hobson's Choice of kill unarmed shepherds or be killed by the Taliban.<br /><br />All of this is simply critiquing the world-view of Luttrell though.  As a true telling of a military operation's planning, execution, and outcome, this is a fascinating tale.  It simultaneously reveals both the best and worst in our nation's military.  We clearly have the best-trained, best-armed troops in the world, and the U.S. Navy SEALS are among the best of our elite forces. If you want some insight into our military's current tasks in the Middle East, and specifically Afghanistan, this book is an excellent choice, with a fascinating front seat, first hand, eyewitness<br />account of one operation.  If you are interested in getting some insight into the training of our Navy SEALs, this may be an even better choice.<br /><br />Whether or not you think this book provides any actual insight into our military policies and efforts in the Middle East, will probably depend on how much, or how little, you support President Bush.  Regardless though, it is a book deserving to be read if you take the political morality play with a grain of salt.ison for murder sometime down the road.

0316017922|4.0|In Outliers, Gladwell attempts to disprove our fascination with the classic from rags to riches stories, and explains that the extraordinary people we love to cherish were not just simply based on pure ability and hard work, but rather through a combination of chance, cultural heritage, and their initiative in taking advantage of the opportunities that were presented to them and practising until they gained unique skills no one at their time could match.<br /><br />Despite this seemingly mundane premise, Gladwell takes what may seem like facts found in a game of Trivial Pursuit and intertwines them into larger stories that are as astonishing as they are engrossing.  By firstly pointing out seemingly unrelated but fascinating topics from sports to law to computer science in the beginning, yet showing us in the end how they somehow remarkably fit as a whole, this book is storytelling at its best.<br /><br />Outliers is a difficult book to categorize - is it a historical reflection of how successful peopl came to be, a sociological theory, a career advice guide, or a sensational story based the facts and intrigues of what goes on around us?  The truth, as it always timidly is, is a bit of everything.  Yet, as with his other work, Outliers is ridiculously intriguing, insightful, and most of all, thought-provoking and strangely inspirational.<br /><br />In the first chapter, Gladwell sets the pace and premise of the entire book by showing us that the brilliant hockey players we adore may not be a<br />product of just pure innate ability - but rather a crucial flaw in the way the youth development system works, and that the day you're born may actually be the most important factor in whether you'll make it as a professional hockey player or not.<br /><br />From then on, he takes us through success stories of brilliant lawyers and software geniuses like Bill Gates and  Bill Joy and dissects them to show moments of incredible luck where they were given the opportunity to make their now renowned success possible.<br /><br />In the second part of the book, Gladwell takes us from rice paddies to flying airplanes and shows how historical and cultural heritage are the cause of the characteristics we have come to stereotype today and how they directly affect the outcome of our day to day lives.  Can the agricultural background and language difference between Asia and the Western world be the cause of why Asians are so much better at Math?  Gladwell thinks so, and he presents a compelling case.<br /><br />Along the way, as Malcolm Gladwell throws in other facts like the required amount of hours of practice needed before you can really be an expert on something (10,000), and the three factors of what makes work meaningful (autonomy, complexity, and clear relationship between effort and benefit), it should be realized that Outliers is not a definite how-to book of being successful.  In fact, there will be several points in the book that will cause you to pause and wonder whether Gladwell is taking too much advantage in being able to cherrypick the facts to benefit his story.  However, it is this thought-provoking experience that adds to the overall quality of the book.<br /><br />In the end, Outliers is about explaining the importance of realizing your roots, of cultural identities that may be unfortunately stereotyped, but are there for a reason and how you can and should take advantage of it.  Whil dispelling many of our social misconceptions, it also proves that there is a place for the ethics of hard work.  Under its seemingly mythbusting purpose of deraveling our fantasies of extroardinary people (outliers), it somehow turns into an inspirational book on how we can look back and acknowledge our inherited strengths and weaknesses, and how to make use of what we have and take the chances that come our way, as how to take the current flaws and extend them to create opportunities to others.<br /><br />As there are certain parts that require more than a small suspension of belief to continue to feel involved in the story, I give this book four stars not because it is not an enticing read, but rather because of personal standards.  On the other hand, while this book will not change your life, it is very possible it can be your call to action.  If you're already a fan of Malcolm's style, this is yet another must read page-turner.  If not, I urge you to at least try the first chapter first.  A throughly enjoyable and enriching experience.nvolved in the story, I give this book four stars not because it is not an enticing read, but rather because of personal standards.

B001ACH4DS|5.0|I'm someone who followed David on Idol, got to know his music through his indie album Analog Heart and enjoyed him both as a musician and as a performer long before this album came out. As such, the thing that worried me most was that David's 1st major label effort won't stay true to the artist he was before the Idol machine had its way with him.   No need to worry. This album is very much a David Cook album, and being a fan of David Cook - that's the highest compliment I could pay.  I can't say there's one skippable song on this album, and I expect it to stay on my rotation for a long long time. Judging by how I'm still not tired of Analog Heart, I think this album just might last me until David's next one comes out....    It's a damn good album. It just is.

B0016HNOXQ|3.0|I cannot say that i'm a fan of Discordinant sound.  Many a musical snob calls this intelligent music.  I call it noise.  It doesn't take rocket science to create garbles of mathematical  sound. Just an analytical mind, & a want to stray far from center.    This release is very disappointing in my estimate.  Not in the fact that it is indeed so unlike old Portishead, but that it lacks in any firm tonal center for much of the duration.   As soon as you begin to want to connect to something, it is quickly ripped from underneath you.    There have been many geniuses that have pushed the bar far from the norm  but have maintained a central tonality in their work.  This is in my estimate where genius lies. You can play with time signatures,  tempo's, progressions, etc; Dave Brubeck, Charles Mingus, Eric Dolphy, King Crimson, Prokofiev, Gorecki,   indian raga's & so on & manage to push the envelope.   But no center, then there's emptiness.   Like building a summer cottage without a foundation & expecting that a summer home can be a permanent home.   It falls apart.  It's fun for the immediate moment, but you quickly lose interest.    There are elements of mind & ear candy on this recording for certain.  However for me it is very temporary. Then i have no want to listen again for a good while.  Stereolab has done similar, but much warmer work over the past 7-8 years.  This cd isn't so much groundbreaking to me, as it is trendy.  For a generation of listeners who really have stopped listening with the decline of the trip-hop era,   or have been forever trapped therein it sounds like a revelation.  The name Portishead carries the weight.   Much like several other bands that had legendary cult followings during their respective era's,   only to take a long hiatus & then re-appear with an updated sound.  People were waiting & waiting, with the want for something to embrace.    Sounds like:   Elements of cold electronic like the algorithmic Autechre,   minus some of their rhythmic structure,   added elements of the coldest of Bjork's post Nelee Hooper vocal arrangements,   Lo-fi analog synth, via Stereolab,   but run through filters to once again create a very cold,   & detached feel.  Elements of the signature Portishead scattered to & fro.
B0014DZ2VO|4.0|When CASINO ROYALE came out a couple of years back, everyone called it a \\"reboot\\" of the Bond franchise.  And in many ways, it was.  The campy elements that had long been a part of the series were gone.  The over-the-top gadgetry was far less in evidence  (partially because REAL gadgets are pretty amazing these days).  The bad guys were not constructing gigantic underground lairs to house their nuclear weapons...they operated in ways that seemed just a little more within the realm of reality.  The action sequences used all the tricks that the BOURNE movies seemed to invent, so they felt more visceral and painful.      And anchoring this new \\"reality\\" was a charismatic, almost minimalist performance by Daniel Craig...who looked like no other Bond we'd ever seen.  He cut an imposing figure, and for once, it was actually okay for Bond to get a little roughed-up looking (not TOO much, mind you, but a little).      In short, CASINO ROYALE felt like something completely different in the world of Bond, yet enough was familiar keep it unmistakably Bond.  It gave the series (and the viewer) a surprising jolt of adrenalin.  We were at last seeing these movies with the same thrill of discovery that audiences for DR. NO felt when Sean Connery first ordered a martini.      QUANTUM OF SOLACE does nothing to tamper with the new formula.  And thus, it must suffer some in comparison to CASINO ROYALE.  The tone is the same (perhaps even a little darker), the action sequences just as jarring, the bad guys just as seemingly mundane and Craig is the very compelling center of it all. (I remember really rooting for Clive Owen to get the Bond franchise...but in reality, I'm quite happy with Craig.)     The plot has something to do with water rights in Bolivia...oh, who cares!  Has anyone ever really invested themselves emotionally in the plot of a Bond film?  What we want is to see astonishingly lavish locales (here we get Sienna, Italy, Port au Prince, Haiti, Bolivia and more).  We want Bond to charm the ladies (nicely done, although Bond now sleeps with far fewer than before).  We want him to have a dry wit and toss off some clever one liners (still done, although far less winkingly than Moore & Brosnan did, thank goodness).  And we want GREAT ACTION SEQUENCES!     And the sequences ARE great, and they come in ample supply.  Heck, the movie starts with a car chase that would be the climactic chase in many lesser films.  And when I say start, I mean START.  There is no set-up whatsoever.  Just BOOM...here you go with crashing fenders and flying metals.  Glass shattering and machine guns firing.  No easing into it.  This is followed by a nice, quiet scene that lasts 5 minutes and then BOOM, we're off on a rooftop chase through Siena.  It's all very good stuff, and I really enjoyed myself.  (Who would have thought a director like Marc Forster [Kite Runner, Finding Neverland, Monster's Ball] would have had such a movie in him?  Then again, who saw John Favreau kicking butt with IRON MAN?!)     Craig is a more somber Bond, because you may remember he lost a loved one (who betrayed him) in the last film.  So now he's out for revenge.  So we see a little tiny bit of torment in him...not so much to detract from the fun, but again, in the manner of this \\"new\\" Bond, to make the film seem a little more human and down-to-earth.  In fact, the underlying theme of the film is conflict between doing what you know is right or safe and exacting revenge at any cost.  Yet I say again, who really cares?  It's nice to see the film isn't laughing at itself...but it also knows how to deliver on the action.     Judi Dench continues to be a strong, maternal presence for Bond...I hope she continues to do these films forever.  Has there ever been a better M?  (Alas, there is no Q or Moneypenny!)  Jeffrey Wright turns up again as Bond's CIA friend Felix Leiter.  He's fine, but under-utilized.     Virtual unknown actress Olga Kurylenko turns up as Camille, the \\"Bond girl\\" who is on her own quest for vengeance.  She cuts a striking, international figure...but I must admit she is pretty forgettable as well.  I don't see her going down in history as a memorable Bond girl.  Gemma Arterton fares better in the much smaller role as the \\"secondary Bond girl\\" Strawberry Fields...but she is not Diana Rigg or Ursula Andress either.  And the always enjoyable Giancarlo Giannini shows up in a small part.     I liked the film quite a bit, as I hope you gather.  It fails to elevate the franchise to another level as its predecessor did...but then again, did we need that?  If you salivating for some good action...QUANTUM will fit the bill.  If you're in the mood for great acting and storytelling...surely you already know to steer clear of a Bond film!
B001ER4CNY|1.0|Any true fan of \\"I Dream of Jeannie\\" already has all of these episodes as they were released over the years.  Seems like simply another way to milk this series one last time for every penny that can possibly be made.  Who cares if it comes with a cardboard bottle?
B001GJ3VYG|4.0|SAFE ... good word for this collection.<br />Especially the first disc.<br />That said, I'm sure the \\"X-Chromosomes\\" of our species will love this new release.<br />And I'm sure that millions will be sold throughout 2009 primarily because of the<br />Global Financial Mess we all have to look forward to. This thoughtful collection is<br />soothing. Dido seems to have found the pulse of what listeners are about to go through.<br /><br />MY FAVORITES - All three songs on the second disc.<br />1. For One Day<br />2. Northern Skies - Remix<br />3. Summer<br />4. Grafton Street<br />5. It Comes And It Goes<br />6. Don't Believe In Love<br /><br />Interesting work.
B001ACH4DS|5.0|First let me say that there's not one song on this album that I would skip over. Every single track is radio-friendly and could be a hit single.  And many will be hit singles.  What amazes me is that this album remains a great rock album, filled with diverse songs that manage to come together as a cohesive album (kudos to Cook AND producer Rob Cavallo).  From hard rocking \\"Bar-Ba-Sol\\" to the soft and melancholy \\"Permanent,\\" this album is pure David Cook, a case-study in versatility.  It remains Cook's vision, with his distinct musical point of view, his songwriting (all but 2 tracks), and best of all, his soaring vocals.  Mid-tempo rock anthems \\"Declaration,\\" \\"Come Back to Me,\\" \\"Light On,\\" and \\"A Daily AntheM\\" have hooks that will wrap around your brain for days.  \\"Lie\\" could be the biggest hit single of all with it's waltz-like arrangement that can easily crossover on Rock, Hot Adult Contemporary, Top 40 and Adult Contemporary radio. His amazing vocals - \\"crushed velvet\\" tones that build to big glory notes - are on full display in \\"Avalanche,\\" a song that could actually chart in the country format as well as pop. Cook promised a record that will stand the test of time.  He delivered, and then some.
031606792X|5.0|I don't care what any of the negative critics of this book say who claim to be fans.  I devoured this book in less than 24 hours and turned back to page one when I was finished to start reading it again (slower this time so I could savor it rather than gulp it down).      I've read all the books in the Twilight series too(side note: I'm extremely sad about Midnight Sun - I agree with the author, I like Edward more after hearing his side) and I LOVED Breakind Dawn just as much as the others.  I loved the deeper view in to Jacob's mind and life and I'm very satisfied with how things turn out for him.  I'm secretly holding out hope that the saga will continue with his life as part of the main focus.      I have no problems with any of the plot twists that bother some others (who are REALLY REALLY over-analyzing).  I've been waiting for Bella and Edward to finally get physical for the last coupld of books and loved the idea of them having a baby.  There are those who want to complain about vampire bodily fluids and their probability -- hello!?  Its a book about Vampires and shape-shifters I don't think probablility should be an issue!!  Who cares how it works, the details of their sex life isn't exactly laid out for all of us and there is a lot we're left to assume, and that is just fine with me.    The last section of the book was a roller coaster that had me at various times crying with Bella, tense, hopeful, despairing and me literally giggling outloud with glee.  Forget those naysayers and critics, give me a happy ending every-time.  If I want reality and depressingly bad endings, I'll go turn on the news.
B001F0VHEM|4.0|As a long time fan of P!nk's I've come to love the awesome range of music she records - and how perfectly she does it. While \\"Funhouse\\" fell a bit short of my expectations, it's yet another token example of how talented of an artist P!nk is. \\"I'm Not Dead\\" is still a better album, however, that's arguably one of the best records ever made. Hence my high expectations for this one. Expect to hear something different, but definitely worth the purchase.
B001ACH4DS|4.0|This album is better than most \\"Idol\\" releases. There are some reviews that make the claim that this release lacks the 'rock' edge that people have come to expect from David Cook -- not the case. Every track has a rock vibe to it, featuring David Cook's usual vocals as seen in the last season of \\"American Idol\\". This isn't a five-star 'perfect' release because there are a few flaws. One of them being how many songs seem a bit heavy, with Cook not really singing or stretching his vocals but instead yelling/screaming on many tracks early on. The sound of many of the tracks are similar, leading for a somewhat lackluster listening experience because few of the songs stand apart and sound fresh and unique. Yet, this release is strong and has some good tracks including \\"Life on the Moon\\", \\"Avalanche\\", \\"Permanent\\" and \\"I Did It For You.\\" These are what works for this release -- a good blend of Cook's penchant for rock/power anthems but also a good mix of actual emotions and Cook doing more with his voice than just belting/screaming. Check out this release, you won't be disappointed.
B001KQKC0Q|2.0|Comparing to the last album where almost every track was hit, this one is unfortunately dud.    I just bought it, listened to it and all I remember is head banging guitar, too loud, trashy sound... And I like good trashy head banging guitar, but this... There is just no range in most of the songs. The sound is flat and loud. That's it.     No tune was really left in my memory after listening.    Lets hope next one is better.
B001GQACGE|3.0|The standard edition of Beyonc&eacute;'s  \\"I Am ... Sasha Fierce\\" features 11 songs spread across 2 discs. In my opinion, \\"I Am ... Sasha Fierce\\" is more engaging and far more mature than her previous release \\"B'Day\\". \\"I Am ... Sasha Fierce\\" features a load of ballads in her usual, big voice, big production manner. It also features more urban-sounding songs that are very different from her past releases. While I feel this release is fun and worth purchasing, I don't believe the standard edition is as strong as the deluxe version. After a listening, the standard seems a bit dull and lacking because some of the best songs from this era are reserved for the deluxe edition.<br /><br />The best songs on this edition includes \\"Halo\\", a power ballad that once played will be in constant rotation for sure. This is  Beyonc&eacute; at her best -- playing into the emotions and going for the big voice and sound as with past hits. \\"Broken-Hearted Girl\\" is also great just due to her approach to the song and shows her growth as an artist, holding back and letting loose when it seems appropriate to create a very emotional and touching song. As for the faster-paced songs, \\"Single Ladies\\" and \\"Radio\\" are the best. What didn't work for me were the songs that felt too forced and over the top, including \\"Diva\\" and \\"Video Phone\\". When stacked against the stronger tracks mentioned above, these and some of the other slower songs seem either rushed or simply weak and boring.<br /><br />In general, the first cd is the stronger of the two. She's at her best when she's singing the ballads and her voice is at its best, really showing her growth as an artist over the years. While I liked the concept of 'Sasha Fierce', I felt like she was trying too hard to be this different artist separate from the Beyonc&eacute; we all have come to know. Buy this release for the songs \\"Ave Maria\\", \\"Halo\\", \\"Broken-Hearted Girl\\" and \\"Radio\\". I'd also advise spending a few extra dollars to buy the deluxe edition for the songs \\"Hello\\", \\"Ego\\" and \\"Smash Into You\\".mash Into You\\".
044022425X|3.0|About a hundred pages into Outlander, the first book of author Diana Gabaldon's unique historical romance series with a time travel twist, I was hooked.  In Claire and Jamie Fraser, Gabaldon has created compelling, unique characters, and the sparks from their relationship virtually fly off the pages.<br /><br />When we last left Claire and Jamie at the end of book three, Voyager, they had survived a shipwreck which had left them in the American colonies.  Drums of Autumn opens with the couple preparing to make a home for themselves in the New World.  Just as the Frasers are beginning to find their place in 1767, the book flashes forward to present-day--1969, that is--and their daughter, Brianna, left alone in Boston when her mother returned to the past to reunited with her true love.  Although Brianna has the support of Roger Wakefield, who is clearly besotted with her, she is still struggling to come to terms with the loss of the only father she ever knew, who she loved deeply, and another father who she has never met, a conflict that has major implications for the plot of this sequel.<br /><br />The story continues to flash between these two settings, and this is where I thought the book started to feel weighed down.  I've always thought that the Outlander series was at its best when it featured Claire and Jamie; although the scenes between Brianna and Roger were interesting, they felt like a distraction after awhile.  In addition, Gabaldon uses a writing technique here not employed in her other books:  there are times when Claire is featured in the scene, yet the scene is NOT told from the first person perspective.  Given that the reader was always given Claire's first-person point of view in the prior Outlander novels, this felt like an unnecessary gimmick to me.<br /><br />Finally, at 1070 pages, this book felt overlong to me.  I don't mind long novels when they are engaging, but I definitely felt bored throughout much of the middle of this book; I think I would've enjoyed it much more if sharper editing had been employed.  Still, I like these characters enough to care what happens to them next, so I am sure that I will still go on to read the next book the series.  My final rating is 3 1/2 stars--just be sure to read the three preceding books in the series before attempting to tackle this one.d've enjoyed it much more if sharper editing had been employed.

B001GQACGO|4.0|The 16-track deluxe version of Beyonc&eacute;'s  \\"I Am ... Sasha Fierce\\" is, in my opinion, the best solo release from this artist. While \\"Dangerously In Love\\" and \\"B'Day\\" were both good cds, this one is far more mature and stronger from start to finish than the other releases which sound a bit juvenile compared to this. What works best for this release is Beyonc&eacute;'s willingness to put out two discs with very different vibes and directions; the first discs features a slew of ballads that definitely make for the stronger of the two discs. These songs include \\"Halo\\", which I suspect will be the hit song from \\"I Am ... Sasha Fierce\\" simply due to the great production and how it plays well with her voice and vocal abilities. \\"Smash Into You\\" (a song available only on this deluxe version) is also a great power ballad unlike anything she's done before that takes her out of the R&B/pop arena that she's been in before and makes her a true mature artist.<br /><br />The second discs, featuring songs that are more urban and hip-hop orientated is where this release becomes a bit weak. While the songs \\"Single Ladies\\", \\"Hello\\" and \\"Ego\\" are great, songs such as \\"Video Phone\\", \\"Diva\\" and \\"Sweet Dreams\\" left me feeling as if she was trying too hard to distance herself from her clean/neat persona to take on this rapper/urban vibe. It didn't work for me on some of these tracks. The second discs' songs feature her tossing in a few choice words, pronouncing certain words and vowels in a bit of a ghetto manner to channel 'Sasha' and the tracks are less polished and sound a bit rushed and sloppy. One 'Sasha' ballad that did work for me was 'Scared of Lonely' which was a good blend of 'both worlds'.<br /><br />In all, easily the best work she's done so far. If you're expecting \\"Dangerously In Love\\" or \\"B'Day\\" then you'll be let down. This cd is a big departure for her, obviously an attempt to be more mature and take on material that is going to appeal to a more mature crowd than to the club/tweens that may have flocked to songs such as 'Crazy In Love' or 'Get Me Bodied.' I enjoyed it and after a few listens found myself getting into it, with the exception of a few named tracks that simply were too over-the-top where I felt she tried too hard to pull off this 'Sasha Fierce' persona. Buy this version of 'Sasha Fierce' and you won't be let down.ve flocked to songs such as 'Crazy In Love' or 'Get Me Bodied.'

B000024D4R|5.0|i could careless what the song means or what the lyrical content is. i have my own beliefs and don't rely on singers to learn things. anyway, the music is killer. the sounds totally stimulate the imagination and the music still ignites my synaptic nodes 30+ years later. the guitar work is about as powerful as a syringe full of electro-chemical substances.
031606792X|5.0|Seemingly with a good novel series, when the end is coming as a reader, one wants it to go on forever. The feelings with finishing the Twilight Saga is much the same. I despise the fact that it had to end, but since it did, this was definitely in good form.<br /><br />Breaking Dawn is the fourth and final installment of the Twilight Saga, not counting the The Twilight Saga: The Official Guide said to be coming out December 2008. (I'm excited). This novel is told differently than the first three. Twilight, New Moon, and Eclipse are all told from protag Isabella Swan's POV and is one whole book each, while Breaking Dawn is divided into multiple \\"books\\" and every other book moves from being as Bella's POV to another long standing character Jacob's POV. It is fascinating and amazing what it does to the story and presents all sorts of details and imagery that would not have been available simply from Bella's mind.<br /><br />This is a big book, this is a good 700-something pages, getting very close to 800, but it is entirely worth the time for a read. It is amazing how well this book sucks you in until you have finished. The entire series is fabulous, in that you have not a clue what will be coming next, but that is essentially a fact in this book. As a reader, I never would have expected to what happened to occur on each following page.<br /><br />Stephenie Meyer is good. She really does deserve to be a Bestselling Author with her gift of story telling. She was easily able to take a figment that has for almost all time been seen as evil and mold it into a form that is \\"trying\\". So many people have fought off this series without attempting to read it, because of a fear factor. I really encourage you to read this series. The themes are fabulous, and it is a great teen read as it was meant as well as an adult read. With love, abstinence, mercy, personal growth, friendship, devotional, and free will as constant themes through out, a reader can learn many things from the forms in which Stephenie Meyer presents a tremendously engaging story.yer presents a tremendously engaging story.
B000PTYPAC|5.0|Amazing from song one to eleven...front lady Haley Williams totally delivers, emotionally as well as vocally. The band is phenomenal, and every element just melds so nicely with each other.

B001EO2UKO|5.0|Dido burst onto the scene in 1999 with her multi million selling debut \\"No angel\\", an electro/pop/dance affair led by the hit \\"Thank you\\" famously sampled by Eminem on his #1 hit \\"Stan\\".<br /><br />Her sophomore disc \\"Life for rent\\" saw her heading in a more Folk-y acoustic direction which I didn't like as in my opinion, it largely lacked tunes and was too gloomy (I actually returned the CD to the store and took Aretha Franklin's new disc instead).<br /><br />Third CD \\"Safe trip home\\" sees her returning still treading in Feist/Emiliana Torrini territory, but with her edginess back, probably thanks to featured guests like ?uestlove (from Rap group The Roots), Mick Fleetwood, and Brian Eno.<br /><br />Opening the disc is the groovy and catchy \\"Don't believe in love\\" (with a bassline that reminds me in parts of The Beatles \\"Come together\\"). This is the most upbeat song. Continuing along those lines is \\"Never want to say it's love\\" (with a groovy bassline). The Brian Eno produced \\"Grafton street\\" (with Mick Fleetwood on drums) is a swirling dramatic ode to her late father. It features a mournful recorder solo from Dido and has a slight Celtic feel. \\"No more trips to Grafton Street\\" she laments. Stunning!<br /><br />The waltz-like \\"It comes and goes\\" is one of my favourites and features a hushed chorus with an instrumental break. \\"Us 2 little gods\\" is a bouncy Folk-y acoustic affair with hand claps.<br /><br />\\"Let's do the things we normally do\\" features lilting percussion and sweeping strings. \\"Burning love\\" has a light Blues feel and features Citizen Cope providing harmonies in the chorus as well as two solo verses. Closing is the almost 9 minute epic, \\"Northern skies\\" with a choppy bassline and beats, and dramatic strings.<br /><br />Taking the tempo down are ballads like \\"Quiet times\\", the piano/strings only \\"Look no further\\", and my favourite, the piano/guitar \\"The day before you came\\" with bassline and strings creeping in as the song progresses. Lyrically, it reminds me of ABBA's \\"The day before you came\\".<br /><br />Quietly affecting!uietly affecting!
B001ACH4DS|5.0|I love David Cook's debut album.  My favorite track is \\"Time Of My Life\\".  This song was the unofficial theme song of the 2008 Olympics.  This song reminds me to savor every day I live.  David has a very strong resonant voice.  He really shows it on the first single \\"Light On  My other favorite track is \\"Declaration\\".  This is a love song with a good rock edge to it.  I really the song \\"Barbasol\\". I think this song is about what it feels like hitting rock bottom in life.  This song has a great beat and sound.  David is an awesome guitar player, and he plays it so well on this track.  \\"Permanent\\" shows the softer side of David.  The piano playing is pretty on this track.  David's vocals on \\"Lie\\" are beautiful.  This song is about how people lie to shelter each other from the truth. \\"Come Back To Me\\" is another highlight here.  This is such a romantic song.  This is an excellent debut by David Cook.
B001GQACGE|2.0|On her third solo disc, Beyonc&eacute; returns with a concept album of sorts, a double disc with disc 1 comprising ballads reflecting Beyonc&eacute;, and disc 2 comprising more uptempo songs reflecting her fiercer alter ego, Sasha.<br /><br />Opening the album is the smash hit \\"If I were a boy\\", co-penned by Toby Gad who also co-penned such lovely acoustic ballads for Fergie (\\"Big girls don't cry\\") and Donna Summer (\\"Sand on my feet\\"). The song is a beautiful acoustic ballad with Beyonc&eacute; stepping into a guys' shoes and telling how she would treat a girl better if she were a guy. It also features some of Beyonc&eacute;'s most heartfelt and best vocals. Other standouts on Disc 1 are \\"Broken-hearted girl\\", the acoustic \\"Smash into you\\" (on the deluxe edition), and the bonus cut \\"Save the hero\\", a Timbaland-style groove with lyrics asking who will be there for her in her time of need, as she's always there for others.<br /><br />Disc 2 boasts more sonic variety; The techno-tinged \\"Radio\\", the club number \\"Sweet dreams\\" (which sounds like something off of former bandmate Michelle's recent Dance CD), the piano drenched \\"Hello\\", the retro Soul sounding \\"Ego\\" (with organ, horns and lovely harmonies), the stomping Darkchild produced \\"Scared of lonely\\" (nice keyboards and swirling synth effects) and the closing bonus cut co-penned by her sister Solange (who I feel should have co-penned the entire CD), the Motown-tinged bouncy \\"Why don't you love me\\" (the latter 4 on the deluxe edition).<br /><br />That makes it 10 good songs on the entire album (assuming you have all 18 cuts), or simply 4 on this version of the disc.

B000MZHW40|5.0|I absolutely love this movie and it battles a topic that is not talked about much, and that is the diamond trade in Africa where people get killed and maimed over these diamonds (hence the term blood diamond).

The \\"Sasha Fierce\\" portion of the album is simply Fierce.  The songs are very upbeat and club-ready.  Just like \\"Single Ladies,\\" the songs make you want to get up on the dance floor.  \\"Fierce\\" is very experimental and very danceable.  Overall, I am very satisfied with this album.

B00005JPLW|5.0|I originally had to view this movie for a history class on history on film. This movie blew me away. You have to keep in mind that it is based on a comic book so the coloring and graphics are going to look exactly like a graphic novel, which is actually one of the best parts because it is so unique. The movie is a little gory but that's because it is depicting one of the most famous battles of Ancient Greece. The acting is amazing. Also, while you are watching it, you can see a lot of intentional parallels with America and its involvement in the war in Iraq. When the Spartan Queen goes before her \\"congress\\" she speaks about how the war is being fought for all the reasons America goes to war. So this movie is actually oddly relevant.<br /><br />This movie will have you rooting for the 300 spartans and will have you on the edge of your seat. It is non-stop action and fairly historically accurate. It also follows the graphic novel to a \\"T\\". I highly recommend this for any history fans, graphic novel fans, and fans of war & actions movies. Word of warning, it is a little graphic and there is a scene where the King and Queen of Sparta are \\"intimate\\" so it is not for young viewers.

Just like \\"Single Ladies,\\" the songs make you want to get up on the dance floor.  \\"Fierce\\" is very experimental and very danceable.  Overall, I am very satisfied with this album.  It is Beyonce at her best.  She shows that she can be Fierce & Gentle all in one album.  Enjoy.    Recommended Downloads:  If I Were A Boy  Ave Maria  Sattellites  Single Ladies  Radio  Sweet Dreams
B000FVQLQQ|5.0|This film definitely deserved all it's academy awards. This movie is amazing from start to finish and Russel Crowe does an amazing job portraying an intelligent man struggling with such a debilatating mental illness. This film will definately pull on your heart strings and get you inside Nash's mind and what it might have been like to be him. You also get to see the brillance of this man who won a Nobel Peace Prize. The special features add to the movie, answering some questions that the viewer still may have.<br /><br />If you end up enjoying this movie, I highly recommend checking out the book as well. It's just as engrossing. I absolutely love this movie. But be prepared to tear up during the movie! Every time I watch it I do.
B0002OERI0|1.0|An album by Green Day entitled american idiot for idiot americans. That about sums it up.
B00005OWEG|5.0|Definitely one of the best Vietnam war movies out there. It is more about the psychological trama of the Vienam war which I liked. It can seem a little out there from time to time but that's to get the viewer to understand it from the main character's point of view. This is definitely not for the younger kids out there and it is pretty intense. It is a must have for any DVD collection. It is one of those classic movies everyone has to see at least once. The acting is amazing. Just an overall great movie.
1878424505|3.0|While I agree with the four agreements - the ideas are good - I don't like how it is presented. It is based on the presumption that life is a dream of Hell. If you don't agree with that the rest doesn't really follow. If that was left out then I would give this a better rating. I do agree though that these agreements are basic common sense but some people still need to read them.
B00080ZG10|5.0|This movie is about Howard Hughes who was an amazing man who suffered from a severe case of OCD. I loved this movie because it didn't show the disease comically. Leonardo DiCaprio took time researching it and really gets the audience to understand how horrible the diease can be and how Howard Hughes struggled with it. Back in those times, it was not as known and studied so treatment was not really there.<br /><br />This is a captivating movie and the special features are great. The plot keeps moving and it never gets boring. It is one of Leonardo DiCaprio's best works. I highly recommend this movie to anyone and everyone. Especially people who enjoy movies that are a biography of sorts. An absolute must-see and must-own.
B0001KL5DA|5.0|Kind of movie that is very interesting to watch. Exciting scenes, some to make you cry.  All the actors are superb and are totally right for their role in the movie. Perhaps Krause and Hall would make a good gay movie??? I rate this a ten along with Queer For Folk.  Thanks for a fab. series.
6305313687|5.0|This is an amazing movie where Edward Norton gives a spectacular performance. Edward Norton starts out as an unrepentant white supremacist but after his jail experience, he comes out trying to save his younger brother from that life. It is an amazing movie about how racism and hatred doesn't get you anywhere and leaves last ripples. It is somewhat graphic so it is not for the younger crowd. It's amazing from start to finish and the ending leave you stunned (and I cried). It is a must own for anyone who enjoys drama films, Edward Norton, and movies with a lesson behind them.
0307394549|5.0|Wonderful cookie plus other deserts cookbook, everything I have tried so far has been great. Easy to use.
B00003CWL6|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies and it gets better each time you watch it. You can identify with some of the characters in the movie and although it is dark and sad, it has a moral to the story and the ending was just amazingly done. Even though your sad for the main character, you still realize that his life had finished in a weirdly positive way. Hence the smile at the end. I highly recommend this movie. It should be in everyone's DVD collection and is one of those movies you can watch over and over again without getting bored. And it is not entirely always dark. There is comedy woven into the movie as well. Again, one of the best Kevin Spacey movies ever.
B0015KO52S|5.0|I bought this album, thinking that i do like raconteurs, but i thought that their first album had a few dud songs on it.  This one really hits the spot after (for me) a year of searching for an album i can just put on and listen to the whole thing with out being tempted to fast forward through a song or two or three.  I really like the first and last songs, and songs 7 & 8.  These are four songs that could anchor an album on their own.  Overall, my best purchase (of music) of the year.
B0011HOEY4|4.0|This movie was pretty good, I am not a huge fan of gangster themed movies but I got it because Denzel Washington and Russel Crowe were in it and they always are great to watch. It's a good plot, it is based on a true-story which I really liked. What I enjoyed most were the special features which show the viewer the real story that inspired the movie. If you like crime dramas, or dramas in general than you will most likely enjoy this movie. It is a little on the long side but it's worth the time.
B001FSDOZO|4.0|You know, I really try to approach every music review with very little expectations; I've found that it makes it much easier for me to truly sit back and enjoy what the artists are doing on any album. This may not make me the best critic in the world, however, because I tend to ignore some of what's come before musically, lyrically, historically, etc. ... but I think it keeps me true to myself.<br /><br />That said, today's Nickelback doesn't sound like yesterday's Nickelback so much.  Sure, three albums ago, they may've had a harder edge, whereas today's Nickelback does seem to flirt more with a mainstream sound.  That isn't necessarily a bad thing; I think the great danger it poses to a group is that may develop a bit of predictability ... but ask any serious Nickelback fan from the group's first album IF he would've expected the band to end up here and I'll bet THAT he never would've predicted.  It shows that the band has tried to evolve, which is more than many bands ever try to do.  It shows that they're striving for staying power -- growing a fan base -- and I can give 'em props for that.<br /><br />Something in Your Mouth (4.5 out of 5)<br />Wake the kids, folks, we're talking serious sex education here with rock'n'roll the way it was meant to be rocked and rolled.<br /><br />Burn It to the Ground (5 out of 5)<br />Classic bad boy rock.<br /><br />Gotta Be Somebody (4.5 out of 5)<br />Hear me out on this one, heavy metal purists.  Somewhere between writing music and selling records, every artist has had to reach a compromise.  Around the time the band penned & performed \\"Photograph,\\" metal purists wrote off Nickelback saying that they went 'mainstream' in order to cash in  But even Robert Downey Jr convinced Gwenyth Paltrow to take a role in IRON MAN by asking her, \\"Aren't you tired of making these great little films that no one sees?\\"  Cut Nickelback some slack.  With \\"Photograph\\" and tracks like \\"Gotta Be Somebody,\\" they're selling MORE records, bringing more fans to their music, and growing the biz.  Hats off, boys.<br /><br />I'd Come for You (4.5 out of 5)<br />Nothing much to add other than the score.  Like the sound, like the sentiments.  I'll leave it at that.<br /><br />Next Go Round (5 out of 5)<br />Serious headbangers are gonna need an MRI after listening to this one.  Thank God for metal.<br /><br />Just to Get High (3.5 out of 5)<br />Drugs destroy lives.  It's about time someone started fighting back.<br /><br />Never Gonna Be Alone (4.5 out ot 5)<br />Great rock ballad.  Even safe for weddings!  Love lasts.  It ought to be celebrated.<br /><br />Shakin' Hands (11 out of 5!!!)<br />Now that's what I call rock.  \\"She ain't no Cinderella while she's getting undressed b/c she rocks it like the naughty Wicked Witch of the West!\\"  Sure, she didn't get that far by \\"shakin' hands.\\"  Best bad li'l girl song I've heard in a long while.<br /><br />S.E.X. (4.5 out of 5)<br />Spelling was never this fun in school.  Only metal could write a song like this.  You don't hear Martina McBride singing it.<br /><br />If Today Was Your Last Day (3.5 out of 5)<br />This territory has already been probed by any musical style.  Not a bad song, just nothing new here.  Been there, done that.  And, yes, Martina McBride has even sung about it.<br /><br />This Afternoon (4 out of 5)<br />What?!  Dare I say it ... a feel/good song?  Major props for mentioning CCR (Credence Clearwater Revival, for the uninitiated).  It's easy to forgive such confections, though it does feel more than just a bit out of place on this album.<br /><br />Overall, a very solid experience.  A bit uneven on sound -- maybe vacillating too much toward mainstream rock than most folks (even critics) would've liked, but I'll forgive Nickelback for putting in the effort.  There's plenty here to celebrate, even for a \\"Dark Horse\\".biz.  Hats off, boys.     I'd Come for You (4.5 out of 5)  Nothing much to add other than the score.  Like the sound, like the sentiments.  I'll leave it at that.    Next Go Round (5 out of 5)   Serious headbangers are gonna need an MRI after listening to this one.  Thank God for metal.

B00005JMCT|3.0|I was a huge fan of the first and second American Pie. Those was hilarious. This just seemed to be stretching it too far. It makes sense to end the series on this movie because it completes the romantic story line but I just did not find it all that funny. Its worth watching once or twice but not worth the purchase. If you are a fan of American Pie I suggest renting this movie instead of buying it.
B00192KCQ0|5.0|I was very sceptical, and have stayed away from buying Death Magnetic based on the last 15 years of Metallica music. Then I heard the album from start to finish this weekend. I went out and picked it up the next morning.    The first 4 albums are excellent, and they were produced by Flemming Rasmussen. Then Bob Rock came in and turned the \\"good Metallica\\" switch off. Now Rick Rubin has been brought in and finally, the masterpiece that should have followed \\"...And Justice For All\\". Rick Rubin is a genius!    This album is very loud, progressive and fun to listen to. Death Magnetic is the album off the year, and easily makes Metallica the comebackk artist of the year. You won't be dissapointed.
B001ACH4DS|5.0|David Cook American Idol 7 winner release is very good. The talk was it was supposed to be perfect with nothing wrong. I love the lyrics, his voice and most of all the whole thing.  I will not compare David vs David on whose cd is the best, they are far 2 different artists. There music is somewhat different, David Archuletas cd is soft ballad and romantic. David Cook has that strong voice to get the message across. Songs: Declaration<br />  Heroes<br />  Light On<br />  Come Back To Me<br />  Life On The Moon<br />  Bar Ba Sol<br />  Mr. Sensative<br />  Lie<br />  I Did It For You<br />  Avalanche<br />  Permanent<br />  A Daily Anthem<br />Bonus: The Time Of My Life<br /><br />I have only been watching American Idol for 2 years now and waiting for the new season, ever since the auditions, I had picked the top 3 and was right, it did not matter out of David C, David A, or Syeshia who won. I loved all 3 and may the best one win. Congrats David C.<br /><br />I will be very happy to see all 3 in concert individually when the time is right.  My favorite songs from this cd is: Come Back To Me and I Did It For you. I am  disappointed with no lyrics printed in the booklet.<br /><br />I am happy with my purchase.
B001FSDOZO|5.0|Highly recommended CD. There is a little change in style from previous records; perhaps \\"poppier\\".    I am not much of a writer but here I go with some highlights:    Gotta be Somebody (5/5) You all know this one by now !!  Something in Your Mouth (4/5) Hard Rocking song; great riffs  Just to get High (5/5): Another outstanding song !! Excellent guitar solo.  Never Gonna Be Alone: (5/5) Great Ballad; reminds be of Def Leppard.  Today Was Your Last Day (4/5) Yet another great song.    SEX, Burn It to the Ground are also good (not great) songs.    Definitely a must buy !!
B001FSDOZO|4.0|Nickelback have always been a band people love to hate because they write catchy songs and sell millions of albums. Well the trend continues because they have delivered another album here with 11 songs that are catchy and well-produced. There's a nice mix of rockers and arena ballads as we've come to expect but this time the rockers are a little more sincere and the ballads are more heartfelt. I think the band has matured a little and I like it. Some credit must go to producer Mutt Lange. He's the rock producer that knows how to get the popular and polished sound while still maintaining that authentic vibe. Best example of this is the intense ballad and album highlight \\"Never gonna be alone\\" and the monster rocker and album opener \\"Something in your mouth\\". This is a great album that I highly recommend - solid 4.5 stars!
B000PFFXOS|2.0|This is a live recording, not the original album.<br /><br />I love the original album.  The low rating is because the CD is advertised as the original recording; but it is NOT THE ORIGINAL RECORDING.  Nowhere on my CD does it say that it is a live recording.  I want to thank the previous reviewer Lynn VERY MUCH for the review.<br /><br />I am old enough to have bought the original vinyl album and I bought this CD many years ago because I wanted to replace my old vinyl LP with a CD.  This disc never sounded right to me.  It always sounded off.  I am older and my ears are not so good and my memory is not so good.  Not until I read the previous review by Lynn did I realize that this is a live recording!  Ya gotta laugh!<br /><br />The original vinyl album was great.
B001C3KCSY|5.0|Kings Of Leon-Only By The Night ****1/2<br /><br />Only By The Night is the closest to a picture perfect album as it has got in 2008. Melodic and true; polished but with grit, in other words fantastic.<br /><br />This group of family members have despite what some may think, reached a high of their career surpassing all their previous efforts. Vocalist Caleb sings with a gritty linear voice with just the right amount of smooth to please everyone within listening distance. The subtle musicianship compliments his vocals nearly perfectly.<br /><br />'Closer' opens it and really encompasses everything the album is going to do in the one song. 'Crawl' is the hardest and deserved second single. 'Be Somebody' and 'Manhattan' have both been done esthetically but Kings Of Leon give it a new twist and do it very well. 'I Want You' breaks hearts while the closer 'Cold Desert' evokes every other emotion known to man. It is however the albums lead single 'Sex On Fire' that shows the power of the band both lyrically and performance wise.<br /><br />Only By The Night is a fantastic record and among the very best of 2008.
B001FW2R5I|3.0|Okay, first and formost, most of the songs on this release are average.  Nothing really great, yet enjoyable.  Actually listening to the disc for the fifth time, it sort of grew on me.  Most songs are, except for the one track that would have been better off shelved and never to resurface again, \\"Better than This\\", is absolute garbage.  I am not saying the singing is atrocious, for it is not, or anything of that nature, I am saying this song is garbage!  I have no idea what they were thinking, nor do I ever want to know, but that one gem could have been lost in the vault and left there to die a slow and horrible death.  Now for the rest of the album, they are typical Keane songs and  have nice catchy hooks and melodies that are nice easy listening.  I must admit, I do like the 80's twist.  Keane still delivers in only a fashion that they can with that twist, so I am okay with it.  If you are a die hard Keane fan, this is a good purchase.  If on the other hand you are looking for something to please your appetite for new music that is unusual, then this may work, but if you are looking for old Keane, break out Hopes & Fears, and Under the Iron Sea, for it is a long wait for their next release.
0132350882|5.0|Robert C. Martin is one of the most experienced developers in the world and tries to share his wisdom with the reader, and he does so in a very clear and well articulated way. He says clearly that the book is not THE answer, but rather a summary of his own opinions.    The book focuses on making easily maintainable code.
B000001FFJ|5.0|Was flipping through a page for Bruce Dickinson's solo albums and I found this in the \\"related\\" section, so I had to drop in here quickly and give my two cents.<br /><br />Anyways, when I first heard this album, it was my first Waits album, and it was very different! Yet I inevitably loved it, his voice was very unique and easy on the ears. Great lyrics too, something I've never heard before as well. Just the opening lines of \\"Singapore\\" was enough to get me hooked. Downtown Train is definitely my favorite song on the album on here, and some other great classic tracks include Gun Street Girl, Clap Hands, Diamonds and Gold, and Blind Love. He's definitely better than a lot of the crap we hear on the radio and TV nowadays.<br /><br />So anyways, if you want something different, be sure to give Waits a try, he has a very interesting voice and some of his lyrics are amazing.
031606792X|5.0|The fourth book to her Twilight series is by far the best.  Stephenie Meyer has twists and turns throughout the book that leave you on the edge of your seat. I absolutely love this book. I wish it never ended.
B001GQACGO|2.0|This is definitely not Dangerously in Love. She will only sell because of her name... I gave it a 2 because I will have to let all of the songs grow on me. This CD is horrible and I have the deluxe version. Her 2nd was not great either. She needs to go back to Dangerously in Love- that is her best work. Save your money get the bootleg
1400063515|2.0|This book reads like something created by the bad professor you had that never gives anybody A's, ever. And why not? Because, at least according to him, nobody is as smart as he is. Nobody. That's because nobody 'is' him. And he is the only smart person in the entire world. He is the Black Swan, smarter than anybody else by a quantum leap, according to Himself. How can he prove that he is so smart? He doesn't prove it, he just calls everybody else a moron instead. Why is he so smart? Well, he doesn't actually say, but if you cannot comprehend that he is by far and away the smartest person who ever lived, bar none, you must be a moron. And there you have it. The Black Swan in a nutshell.    So is he really that smart? Like many narcissists, he seems capable of convincing some people so. He did have one marginally clever thought, and here it is: don't throw out the outlier. To elaborate, outliers have curious and unique statistical behaviors and can be quite socially influential; outlier incidents can be predicted in retrospect, but never anticipated; and outlier events probably occur more frequently now than they every have, due to the influence of new media. Yeah, so what.     Like a classic narcissist (self-important to the point of indolence), he does not analyse his hypothesis in any way that would involve actual work (experimentation), at least none that he mentions. He may briefly claim that (I'm paraphrasing) \\"such analyses are impossible, you moron.\\" He says his one good thought, says it again, quotes Hume, talks about himself and how great he is and how his people are downtrodden, and tosses out numerous extremely self-aggrandizing aspersions about philosophers and the people who study them. My favorite snotty comment was something like: as opposed to people who quote other philosophers, a few people who quote Hume have actually bothered to read Hume.     Probably a good half of the book is random narcissistic drivel, forty percent snide comments and ten percent the Black Swan idea, over and over again, with little new information presented.    What this guy needed was a good ghost writer, but I can't imagine sitting in a room with this guy for more than 10 minutes and not wanting to rip his throat out. I'm guessing all prospective ghost writers quit after being called morons and/or oppressors a few thousand times in a matter of hours.     Read a synopsis of the book for the one marginally interesting idea the guy ever had in his life if you want to, but I suggest you don't bother, because even his one idea is no big whoop-te-do. That is, don't bother to read this book unless you're trying to come up with character ideas for a really odious, pompous bad guy. In that case, this book is a goldmine.
B0011UF79C|4.0|This movie is really really good-looking. It is essentially a murder mystery wrapped in science-fiction coating. Ethan Hawke plays an over-ambitious man who dreams of becoming an astronaut. Jude Law extracts pity as a crippled man confined to a wheelchair. The movie's message is that a child's physical or biological traits at birth, or even till age 10, cannot accurately predict how he/she would do in later life.
B000002J1U|4.0|Led Zep's 3rd album continued the epic rise of the mighty band but was seen at the time as a slowdown because of its strange diversions and acoustic numbers.  In reality, it showcased a different identity for the band and provided a nice contrast to their previous albums by not being a pure rock album.<br /><br />The album's predecessor - Led Zep II had been recorded in spurts while the band was on tour and though powerful, was uneven in parts.<br /><br />In contrast, Led Zeppelin III was a lot more focussed and sophisticated in production.  A very nice album indeed.  Although it gets the least play on my Zep list, the ideas here would define the group's sonic and acoustic inventiveness; and their love of light and shade.<br /><br />Page unleashes the full fury of Zep on \\"Immigrant Song\\" and then goes into the otherworldly \\"Friends\\" before rocking out on \\"Celebration Day.\\"  \\"Since I've Been Loving You\\" follows and is the ultimate Zep blues anthem that's never been bettered.  \\"Out on the Tiles\\" is a throwaway number and \\"Gallows Pole\\" is another Zep reworking of a blues number.  \\"Tangerine\\" and \\"That's the Way\\" recall Zep's childhood innocence and showcases their acoustic side. \\"Bron Yr Aur Stomp\\" is another Zep ditty.  The album ends with \\"Hats off to Roy Harper\\": a proto / primal blues number that's been thumbed down by many a Zep fan as being weird.  In fact it was a tribute to their blues roots which most overlooked.<br /><br />What would Zep be without the spirit of experimentation?  Zep III may have been viewed as a stop gap then but is now accepted as an essential part of the band's oeuvre.
B001ACH4DS|5.0|Finally another Idol contestant to join the original few.  David Cook soars through his debut album with a blend of pop/rock songs that all compliment his voice perfectly.  From the chine spilling power ballad \\"Permanent\\" to the hardcore rock jam of \\"Bar-ba-sol\\", Cook proves his versatility and impressive vocal abilities.  Excellent album!    Top 5:    1)  Declaration  2)  Permanent  3)  Heroes  4)  Avalanche  5)  Life On The Moon
B00004SZWD|5.0|It's sad that Stevie Wonder is best known and will be remembered by most for his ballads ala the schticky \\"I Just Called To Say I Loved You.\\"  This album confirms his genius and echoes strangely enough for me - The Beatles' Sgt Pepper's album.  Songs like \\"Village Ghetto Land\\" reflect a storytelling aspect.<br /><br />Like many artists of the seventies, Stevie was pretty progressive on this one. Some serious music here crossing a wide range of styles.
B0017ZB8M6|1.0|I can't believe all the 5-star ratings for this CD, this has to be a joke! I would give this 0 stars if I could.   While somewhat catchy, the hyper-produced songs have a familiar radio-ready quality that becomes infuriatingly mind-numbing over time, and Perry's vocals sound like a less-soulful Kelly Clarkson at best, a drunken, spurned sorority girl at worst.   Madonna and Perez Hilton may be fans, then, but if you've got even a passing interest in actually enjoying a record, don't buy this one.
B001C08RHA|4.0|I've been a big fan of the Iron Man comic book series for such a long time and from the \\"Tales of Suspense\\" comic books, as a young child, I would always be into the \\"Avengers\\" and even be this happy child with his \\"Secret Wars\\" Iron Man toy.<br /><br />Years before \\"IRON MAN\\" became a movie, I've always pictured Robert Downey Jr. as Iron Man.  He had the look and even back then with Downey Jr.'s personal life, there is some instances that mirror Tony Stark's challenges in the comic books.  So, suffice to say that I was quite happy with him being cast for the film.<br /><br />As for the the film, I had no doubt in my mind that \\"IRON MAN\\" would be a blockbuster hit in the Summer but I purposely waited for it to come out on DVD, so I can watch it on my own personal home theater and watch it with no distractions.<br /><br />This film focuses on Tony Stark, the millionaire who runs Stark Industries which creates weapons for the military but while on a meeting to the Middle East, Stark's military escort are gun down and eventually the suave millionaire gets caught in a blast (from weapons created by his company), next thing you know, Stark is being operated on and being held by prisoner by terrorists.<br /><br />While under captivity, Stark creates his first Iron Man uniform and uses it to escape his captors.  Upon returning back to America, Stark's perspective of the world and his company has changed.  Also, his goal to develop a more technologically advanced mobile suit armor becomes his obsession and leads him to take on the terrorist who have been using his companies weapons for evil but most of all prepare for the lies and deceptions that await him.<br /><br />AUDIO & VIDEO:<br /><br />The version that I am reviewing is the regular widescreen DVD, not the awesome Blu-ray version packed with a lot of extras.  But the audio for this version is Dolby Digital 5.1 and video is widescreen enhanced for 16:9 TV's.<br /><br />SPECIAL FEATURES:<br /><br />This \\"IRON MAN\\" DVD version features deleted and extended scenes.  Deleted scenes that I'm glad the director chose to eliminate from the final cut of the film.<br /><br />There are three versions of this release on DVD/Blu-Ray.  This version is the single disc version, the double disc version features many featurettes including a 108-minute documentary, a six part documentary and more.  The Blu-ray version has received almost perfect stars for its amount of content and BD-Live.  So, if you have a Blu-ray player, the Blu-ray version of \\"IRON MAN\\" is what is recommended.<br /><br />After watching it, I definitely enjoyed the film but like any superhero film, as the first film always focuses on the origin, this series will be judged on its continuing storylines.  Similar to like the \\"X-Men\\", \\"Spider-Man\\" and the \\"Fantastic Four\\" films, there is always the \\"origin\\" that not many people are too enthusiastic about and want to see more battles.<br /><br />Fortunately, \\"Iron Man\\"did offer quite a bit of kick as battles but I loved the scene where Iron Man just rescues a village being terrorized by the enemies.<br /><br />Again, Robert Downey Jr. did a great job as Tony Star, Jeff Bridges as Obidiah Stane was pretty good.  As for Terrence Howard's James Rhodes... it was OK but I was expecting more of a no-nonsense Rhodes.  But with Don Cheadle replacing Howard for the next film, I hope that Cheadle can bring the attitude especially if he's going to be War Machine.<br /><br />But definitely enjoyed this film.  With \\"IRON MAN\\", unlike any other top tier Marvel superheroes, Robert Downey Jr. has a lot of inner demons to contend with and is such a complex character.  For the comic series, the alcoholism consumed him and I'm curious to see if it happens in the films.  It will definitely be interesting to see how his character is explored and what new Iron Man outfit we will see him sporting next Silver Centurion Iron Man?  Maybe even see some Hulkbuster or Thorbuster?  Who knows.  And of course, there is James Rhodes as War Machine and I look forward in seeing that character come to play in the films.<br /><br />But all in all, \\"IRON MAN\\" was an enjoyable film for the first version.

B001KPK6Q2|5.0|Taylor Swift, the young Country vocalist/songwriter who has been topping the charts and a performer recognized for her talents and of course, most recently with the whole Joe Jonas breakup that seems to have become media fodder as of late.<br /><br />But these type of experiences of love and breakups have been an instrumental part of Swift's life because she manages to take these good and bad experiences and like a painter who can grab the attention of the viewer through creativity, the same can be said about Taylor Swift's music.<br /><br />I've listened to this album a good number of times already and I have to admit that I'm quite impressed by her ability to craft these lyrics and literally grab the listener because each track is almost told in a storytelling fashion.<br /><br />In fact, there is not one song I didn't like.  The theme of \\"Fearless\\" for the most part is about love and where Pink's \\"Funhouse\\" is a good example of an album that features emotions after a bitter breakup and thus her album is quite dark, Swift's \\"Fearless\\" is an album with tracks of those emotions that one would have when they are in love whether it's a teenage crush, in a relationship or after a breakup.<br /><br />Swift's hit song \\"Love Story\\" is just an awesome track that showcases her songwriting skills but songs such as \\"Hey Stephen\\" is one of those songs that feature that storytelling style.  In this song, Swift writes about a boy named Stephen that she has a crush on but other girls also like him.  And it's almost like reading a page from Swift's diary about innocent feelings towards a person she likes.<br /><br />Then there's a track like \\"Fifteen\\" in which she writes about starting the first day as a freshman in high school and getting in a relationship with someone at the young age at 15.<br /><br />Or a song like \\"The Way I Loved You\\" which is another well-written song (which she co-wrote with John Rich) about the pain of love and loving someone but a love that is over and looking back at the relationship.<br /><br />Then you have her musical side in which she performs the acoustic guitar driven track \\"Breathe\\" with another popular and talented young artist Colbie Caillat.<br /><br />And then there is the track \\"Forever & Always\\" which Swift wrote about her then boyfriend Joe Jonas (Jonas Brothers) and with their somewhat breakup that has been featured recently in the media, it will be interesting to see what kind of song Swift will pen for that.<br /><br />\\"Fearless\\" is just a fantastic album!  Taylor Swift, she definitely stands out among the many young music artists out there and also, for the Country music genre, the ability to crossover and become a Country/Pop star in America.<br /><br />Although we have seen someone like Carrie Underwood, Faith Evans and Shania Twain to do this, for someone as young as Taylor Swift to really come out so strong and able to attract listeners who typically may not have listened to Country music.  Also, Swift is just not the average artist with good looks and a great voice, she's also a talented songwriter and musician.  Definitely a true talent and you can only wonder how this young woman will develop over the years.<br /><br />The songwriting skills and the creativity behind the lyrics and her ability to take those lyrics and sing them sweetly and convincingly in a storytelling fashion is what I have enjoyed about \\"Fearless\\".  Beautifully written lyrics, songs that feature catchy melodies, elegant vocals and just overall, well-done!<br /><br />Again, \\"Fearless\\" is simply, fantastic!e her musical side in which she performs the acoustic guitar driven track \\"Breathe\\" with another popular and talented young artist Colbie Caillat.    And then there is the track \\"Forever & Always\\" which Swift wrote about her then boyfriend Joe Jonas (Jonas Brothers) and with their somewhat breakup that has been featured recently in the media, it will be interesting to see what kind of song Swift will pen for that.    \\"Fearless\\" is just a fantastic album!  Taylor Swift, she definitely stands out among the many young music artists out there and also, for the Country music genre, the ability to crossover and become a Country/Pop star in America.    Although we have seen someone like Carrie Underwood, Faith Evans and Shania Twain to do this, for someone as young as Taylor Swift to really come out so strong and able to attract listeners who typically may not have listened to Country music.

Beautifully written lyrics, songs that feature catchy melodies, elegant vocals and just overall, well-done!    Again, \\"Fearless\\" is simply, fantastic!

I recommend this book not just to those interested in their health but also to those interested in improving their families' health.
B000W91RUG|5.0|I don't think I have busted a gut watching a comedy series until watching \\"The Big Bang Theory\\".  What a wonderful and hilarious series coming from the minds of Chuck Lorre and Bill Prady.<br /><br />The series is about two physicists Leonard (Johnny Galecki) and Sheldon (Jim Parsons) who live in an apartment together.  One day, they get a new neighbor with Penny, a blonde and beautiful woman from Nebraska who has come to California for a better life but after a bad breakup, finds friendship with Leonard and his friends.<br /><br />Joining Leonard and Sheldon are their two best friends Howard (Simon Helberg), a perverted and horny brainiac and Rajesh (Kunal Nayyar), another brainiac but has a problem with his inability to speak with beautiful girls.<br /><br />What makes this comedy work so well are the character dynamics and each of their quirks.  Especially the character of Sheldon who is just the most anal geek among the three but Parson's Sheldon just is incredible.  Included in this season 1 box set are a total of 17 episodes.<br /><br />  1. Pilot - Penny moves into the building and Leonard who is smitten by her agrees to get back her TV from her muscle-bound ex.<br />  2. The Big Bran Hypothesis - Leonard is addicted to cleanliness and organization and can't stand Penny's messy room, so he sneaks into her room during the early morning to organize her room.<br />  3. The Fuzzy Boots Corollary - Leonard has a date with Penny but she doesn't know it's a date.<br />  4. The Luminous Fish Effect - Sheldon gets fired from work and decides to stay at home, concocting experiments and annoying everyone.<br />  5. The Hamburger Postulate - Leonard's not sure if he'll ever become Penny's boyfriend, so he and a fellow co-worker decide to have sex, while Sheldon doesn't know what to do when his roommate is having sex in their apartment.<br />  6. The Middle Earth Paradigm - Penny's having a Halloween party and all the guys are invited including her ex who picks on Leonard.<br />  7. The Dumpling Paradox - What happens when Howard gets lucky with Penny's friend?<br />  8. The Grasshopper Experiment - Rajesh finds a way to get over his inability to speak to a woman but what happens when his parents plan an arranged marriage and he has to meet with this woman.<br />  9. The Cooper-Hofstadter Polarization - Leonard and Sheldon are invited to present their physics findings but instead leads to a fight between the two.<br />  10. The Loobenfeld Decay - Sheldon can't tell a lie, so he puts Leonard in a odd situation.<br />  11. The Pancake Batter Anomaly - Sheldon is sick and the guys start to panic and go in hiding, leaving Sheldon with Penny.<br />  12. The Jerusalem Quality - A child prodigy comes to the campus and Sheldon is feeling threatened by him.<br />  13. The Bat Jar Conjecture - It's time for the physics bowl team and Sheldon is the MVP.<br />  14. The Nerdvana Ahhihilation - What happens when Leonard orders a (very large) time machine from a film.<br />  15. The Pork Chop Indeterminacy - Sheldon's twin arrives and the guys fall for her.<br />  16. The Peanut Reaction - It's Leonard's birthday but what happens when he and Wolowitz get an allergic reaction from eating peanuts.<br />  17. The Tangerine Factor - Leonard and Penny go on their first date.<br /><br />AUDIO AND VIDEO:<br /><br />The audio is stereo and nothing major since the show is primarily all dialogue.  As for the video, the earlier episodes has a bit of graininess to it.  I thought maybe playing the disc on a Blu-ray player maybe showing a lot of noise but I checked the disc on another player and it seems that the first few episodes just had a bit of it.  But fortunately, not all of it are like that.  If anything, you see it moreso on the pilot.<br /><br />SPECIAL FEATURES:<br /><br />The DVD box set unfortunately doesn't have too many special features.  Included is a featurette titled \\"Quantum Mechanics of The Big Bang Theory: A Behind-the-Scenes Look Into GeekChic\\".  The 20-minutes featurette features interviews with the creators Chuck Lorre and Bill Prady and also the cast.<br /><br />What I found interesting about the featurette was learning how the show was created, how the actors were selected and the use of science in the show.<br /><br />I've always wondered what would happen on television with a lot of the sitcoms now nearly all gone from television except on syndication.  But I have to admit that Monday nights on CBS has become my favorite night thanks to \\"The Big Bang Theory\\" and \\"How I Met Your Mother\\".<br /><br />I have to admit that \\"The Big Bang Theory\\" is just so enjoyable to me because of my enjoyment of super heroes, comic books,  technology, video games, science, etc.  Although these guys are more on the extremeness of geekiness, I can't help but love the show.  It's absolutely one of the best sitcoms right now and for a comedy series, I don't think I have laughed so much since \\"Seinfeld\\".<br /><br />You can find this season 1 set for a great price and I definitely recommend this TV series!  Give it a try, you'll love it!What I found interesting about the featurette was learning how the show was created, how the actors were selected and the use of science in the show.

B000N3ST9I|5.0|The Blackening is the album the metal community has been begging for. Always been a big MH fan, but this is by and far their masterpiece. I do recommend the special edition with the two cover tracks and DVD. Well worth the extra coin. Any metal fan should not be without this CD in their collection. MH fan or not, this could be the most important metal album of this generation. Yeah..........it's that good. I raise my glass and \\"clinched fist of dissent\\" to Machine Head!!!!!
B0017I1FO4|5.0|I highly recommend this cd. It is good fun hard rock coupled with some wonderfully moving songs intermixed.  I liked this so much I purchased their prior cd's and they are great also!
B00102FELM|5.0|THIS IS ONE GREAT \\"WHOLESOME\\", \\"HARD ROCK\\", \\"HEAVY METAL\\" CONCERT DVD!!! THESE GUYS ARE FROM GERMANY (THIS DVD WAS FILMED IN HAMBURG, GERMANY), AND THESE GUYS HAVE BEEN ROCKING SINCE THE EARLY 1970'S. THIS BAND AND THIS CONCERT IS \\"HARD ROCK\\", AND \\"METAL - GUITAR\\" ROCK AT ITS VERY BEST!!!<br /><br />THE SCORPIONS ARE Klaus Meine on vocals and guitar, Rudolf Schenker on guitar and backing vocals, matthias jabs on guitar, James Kottak on drums and Pawel Maciwoda on bass. Then you get guest musicians of Uli Jon Roth, and Michael Schenker and Herman Rarebell.<br /><br />The concert consists of 26 songs, all performed extremely well. Note - this is high-powered rock and roll!!! High Energy rock from some old pro's.<br /><br />Germany loves Southern Rock, both Molly Hatchet and Lynyrd Skynrd have recorded concert dvd's in Hamburg. And this \\"Southern Rocker\\" likes the Scorpions. I've been a fan for years, they are a good solid hard rock and roll band who put 100 percent Plus energy and effort into their performances. They are not vulgar, or evil or any of that kinda stuff, they are just a good \\"wholesome\\" hard rock band.<br /><br />THIS IS A REAL HARD ROCK CONCERT, VERY WELL PERFORMED, AND I HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT!!!
0156030209|5.0|This book is amazing.  Pay attention to the metephor at the end, and decide which is the truth, the story or the metaphor?
B001C08RHA|1.0|This movie spends 7/8 of it building the plot. There are 2 action scenes,  only one of which has any substance and duration.  This movie cannot compare to any of the other comic book movies on any level. If there is a sequel it stands a slim chance of being good but it cannot be any worse. Ironman for a superhero is as weak a character as Magneto, or Aquaman, or Greenlantern. It cannot touch Superman, Batman or Spiderman. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY.This cannot be classified as an action movie, it is a total sleeper.
B001ACH4DS|5.0|Every song is a keeper.  Hear it once and you like it.  Hear it more than once and you absolutely fall in LOVE with it.  Despite what anyone thinks about AI, David Cook is the real deal and someone the music industry has been waiting to hear from for quite a while.  Long live rock!  Go DC!
B001JRYH2K|4.0|Hmmmm... I seriously have my doubts about this.  Come on, don't you find that strange that the price for this so very awaited dvd is this low, under 10$ is not usually reserved for a premium movie like this one.<br /><br />Also, it's look like Amazon wanted to sell this but not too much......incredible.....Like if there was some kind of a shame in this movie like it was the case for other movies (example: Twilight zone:the movie).....<br /><br />At the time of writing this i haven't see if the movie was in widescreen...if not...grrrrr another proof that they do not really want to sell it. Anyway, i was expecting a blu-ray as well. Especially with the fact that we've been waiting 26 years for this release.<br /><br />fishy...fishy.........there is something going on........and we're gonna find out sooner or later.
0743270754|5.0|This book should be on the \\"must read\\" list for anyone who is either in a position of leadership, or would like to be.  Having read this book I could completely understand how people make it their life's work, being a Lincoln scholar.  While many have written of Lincoln, this author gives equal coverage to those critical to the success of his efforts, those who were so assured that they would be the presidencial nominee, that they did not even attend the convention.  To learn how to work effectively with those who we may not necessarily like, is a lesson this country could stand to learn...quickly!
B001IUBZAU|5.0|Apart from two bad albums in the eighties, AC/DC have never disappointed their fans. They deliver again on Black Ice. This album is everything you'd expect from them.  Some reviewers may say that they are doing the same stuff for the last 35 tears. So what? If I want something new, I'll buy a different band.  Great album, to be played loud!
B000RPTQ1C|5.0|It is very rare when I buy an album that I like EVERY song, but that is the case with Coldplay's newest album.  This is their best, ever!
B0010V4TSW|5.0|New Religion is a very good power metal cd. probaly one of PF's best I rank it right up there with Nuclear Fire. This album sounds very smooth and polished.Ralf sounds great on this album. I think this might be his best vocals yet just check out Sign OF Fear. This album does seems to have more radio friendly songs like Everytime It Rains(with Simone Simons from Epica) and Fighting the Darkness but I dont feel that it takes anything away from the album. As for The rest of the album it sounds like some good old fasion power metal.If you are a fan of Primal Fear this album is definetly worth picking up. If you are new to Primal fear this is a good starting point. If you want to check out some other PF albums I say go with [[ASIN:B000056AQG Nuclear Fire]] next.
B00008WT5C|5.0|Terrific album. I haven't heard it played as an album-side since high school. Still one of the best.
B00006DEF9|5.0|I was hesitant to go for the two disk set, but it's really worth it if you love musicals, and love MGM movies. The second disk is a great addition, packed with loads of info about Arthur Freed, with commentary by Debbie Reynolds, and it even includes the original film clips of the songs in the movie. This is a great choice for a fan.
B000BTJDGC|3.0|I watched \\"Emily Rose\\" when it first came out on DVD a year or so back, but for the life of me could't remember it? This past weekend I dug the DVD out of the closet for another view.<br />While there are some spooky and eerie images found in the film, the movie actually plays out more like a \\"Law & Order\\" episode than a horror film. And while Emily Rose gets titled billing, the story really focuses on the Laura Linney attorney character Erin Bruner, and her journey from skeptic to believer. The cast does a really great job, Jennifer Carpenter does a good job as the title character and Tom Wilkinson strikes a perfect chord as the priest accused of allowing Emily to die while under his care.<br />But, if you are in the mood for a horror film, you may want to pick up something else. \\"Emily Rose\\" is a decent courtroom drama, along the lines of \\"A Few Good Men\\", except in this film, the case deals with possible demonic possession as opposed to a marine's death.<br />It's not a bad film by any means, well directed, and does its best to maintain a spooky mood (but doesn't quite achieve that goal). If you are looking for straight up horror look elsewhere.
B000NQDC1A|5.0|i've had the set of lps which come with a nice book that has plenty of pictures.  the cd set has better sound but lacks the book.    this will really clean out your ears and refresh your musical mind.    so many different sounds, modern instruments sound colorless by comparison.    highly recommended.
B001GKJ2DO|5.0|I had never seen the stage play although (1) I lived in Las Vegas where it's been on stage for yonks and (2) I have seen the very old movie it's based on, Buena Sera Mrs. Campbell. Okay, this said, when I saw the trailer for the movie on TV, it seemed so joyous, I couldn't wait to see it. It was wonderful even though the stars don't sound like ABBA and I loved it so much I went back to see it again with my adult daughter and her friend. I am anxious to see it on DVD!  What is it that's so appealing? Well, the scenery (pooh on experts and their so-called knowledge of cinematography), the dancing and the story which resonates with me because I had a similar experience during that very same \\"flower power\\" time period. I think for 50-somethings, it does resonate. I loved Meryl Streep, thought Pierce Brosnan perfect for the role of the not-forgotten lover and howled at Meryl's two girlfriends. I have always liked Julie Walters, loved her in Educating Rita and in She'll Be Wearing Pink Pyjamas.
B001KQKC0Q|5.0|As usual NB sells the hot stuff, awesome and touching! Gives me goosebumps! Love it!
B001ACH4DS|1.0|This is to all the Cougars out there like me. I loved David Cook on American Idol, and I downloaded all his recordings from the show.  I was so looking forward to his first CD, but I am quite disappointed.  I think the whole CD is over produced, it is too much noise and not enough emotion.  This is not the David Cook who won AI.
B001ACH4DS|4.0|Cook has a great voice and most of the songs on the CD are really good.   Permanent and Life on the Moon are excellent.   Some of the songs start out great - where you can clearly hear his voice - then the band starts playing TOO LOUD, which competes with the voice and Cook almost starts to shout to be heard over the band.   The song, Permanent is gorgeous - amazing lyrics and performed to perfection - it is a chill-inducing masterpiece.   I would like to hear cook perform more songs like that - without the loud band which probably has too many people in it.   Cook is so talented, he does not need too many band members.  And with such a great voice, the background noise is just too much on some of the songs.   It is the best CD of any former Idol contestant.  That's because Cook is the most talented contestant of that show.
B00000K3CM|5.0|People look at me like I'm nuts when I tell them that this is my favorite of the Home Alone films. Well whatever. The main reason that I like this movie is because of the way they portray New York's best sights like Central Park, etc. Whereas the first movie kept most of the scenes at his home, this one explores other scenery. And the cast is hilarious. My favorite character (aside from Kevin)is the bird/homeless woman who ends up being a sweetheart. I always choke up at the end when she and Kevin hug it out. I think everyone should have this movie in their holiday collection. Yes, and the first one too.
B001ACH4DS|5.0|I discovered Analog Heart while David was on AI and I only hoped that this album would be just as good.  I was pleasantly surprised and happy to find that this album was just as good.  It's obvious that David had a large role in producing this album as it's totally his sound and style.  I've always feared the overproduced garbage that 19E tends to push on it's AI winners but they didn't this time.  Perhaps they saw how AH was doing so great on Amazon before it was yanked?    Anyway, I loved this whole album.  The ballads are moving, rockers are rocking and the songs were well written and arranged (and performed!).  Faves include Life on the Moon, Come Back to Me, Lie, Permanent & Declaration.  The only song I didn't totally love was Barbasol - just because it seemed a little disjointed from the rest of the album.  This song seemed more like something I would have expected to hear on an Axium album (his old band).  I have 2 of the Axium albums but actually prefer Analog Heart.  It's the AH sound I was hoping for and I was not disappointed!  Looking forward to hearing many more albums from DC in the future!
B000VBIGD6|5.0|A classic fave in my family's household. My mom's favorite scene is of course teh squirrel rampage. Especially when the grandmother faints. Mine is the dinner table when the pathetic turkey evaporates into dust and Snots hocks a loogie under the table. There's so much insanity going on all at once, it's hard to catch your breath. Oh! and Clark's meltdown is one of the best I've ever seen on film. I'm still trying to memorize every word LOL.
B0016K40KY|1.0|In the product description is said it has subtitles in spanish, due to the fact that my dad only speaks spanish I thought it would be a great gift for him and make him remember his days of youth, but its just a BIG LIE!!! the movie only has 2 languages: English and French.  Now why didn't we returned it? We are too far away to start a process like that and my dad was too excited to take a look at the description that he just peeled off the wrap.
B001H5X7I4|4.0|You'll laugh but this movie isn't for the easily offended. Heck, even a few hard-to-offend viewers will cringe, too. A comedy hasn't had this much in-your-face political incorrectness since [[ASIN:B0001Z4OXS Blazing Saddles]].<br /><br />You'll be worn out by the end of this two-hour movie but that's not necessarily a bad thing. The hardest laughs come all too quickly before the film settles down to a slower pace.<br /><br />The story follows a group of high-maintenance actors on the set of a Vietnam war movie that is spinning out of control and likely to become the all-time box office flop, pushing aside [[ASIN:B000NQRR1G Cutthroat Island]], [[ASIN:B00003CXWS The Adventures of Pluto Nash]] and [[ASIN:B000FS9UK8 Basic Instinct 2]].<br /><br />Ben Stiller has the most screen time but Robert Downey Jr. steals the scenes as an Australian method actor who manages to eclipse Robert De Niro's famed transformation in [[ASIN:B00062IVKS Raging Bull]].<br /><br />Jack Black (in a nod to Eddie Murphy's [[ASIN:0783225539 The Nutty Professor]]), Brandon T. Jackson, Jay Baruchel round out the rest of the main acting troupe. In smaller roles, Nick Nolte portrays the author of the book, Tropic Thunder, which \\"got\\" the movie deal (there's an in-joke). Matthew McConaughey appears as Stiller's TiVo-crazed agent and Tom Cruise appears nearly unrecognizable in creepy make-up as the film's producer. Not a single actor displays anything approaching subtlety or sanity.<br /><br />One final warning: skip the DVD extras at your own risk. The viral video for MTV is hilarious.
B000HC2LI0|1.0|I bought this and when I opened it, it has two copies of Season 2 and none of Season 1!  I sent it back to Amazon, and to my surprised, it was the same thing-Two copies of Season 2, and None of Season 1.  How can this pass QA???  I can only assume that at least two copies of this collection comes with two Season 1 and none of Season 2.    This is a great series and someday I'll own it.  But that's not today since I'm sick of sending stuff back to Amazon.

0812550706|5.0|This is a fantastic book that inspired me to go our and read all of the Orson Scott Card books out there. He is a really talented writer. I heard they are making it into a movie but imdb does not have much on it. I had the pleasure to meet Orson Scott Card one time and why I don't agree with his political views, he was a great guy and remains one of my favorite writers.
0399230033|4.0|My son loves this book.  He really enjoys listening to the stories that his dad makes up about each animal.  There aren't too many words, leaving you room to ad-lib it, which is fun!  This is one of our many books we tend to read at night.
B001H5X7JS|5.0|I'll keep this short and sweet. I didn't really expect much from this movie. It seemed like it had potential, but that was it. I was happy to find that it was hilarious and fairly intelligent. Whatever you think of the cast, I highly recommend this film. More specifically, I recommend the 2 disc directors cut version. I haven't seen anyone do this well with a special features disc in a long time.
B001GKJ2DO|5.0|I paid 3 time to see this movie, and if this movie came out in theaters again in the future, i would pay again to see it in the big screen. It's a \\"feel good\\" movie, it's funny and up beat. the fact that the cinematography aspects were not \\"perfect\\", made it BETTER!!! more real! The only thing that cought my attention from this movie was the fact that meryl streep is in it...But after seeing it, there is so much more that made the movie just great!!!
1878424505|5.0|Those are four pretty good agreements. I would like to add a fifth: that Brian Moore does everything for the ladies.
B001ACH4DS|3.0|Produced by Grammy-winner Rob Cavallo (Green Day) David Cook's debut solo album employs every trick in the book of the 80s rock genre:  Crunchy guitar chords with lots of reverb, songs in which Cook and the band crank it up when the big bombastic hook comes, thudding snare drum sounds, and tinkling piano chords on \\"Sister Christian\\"-like power ballads.  The single \\"Light On\\" sounds like Lionel Richie meets Journey, while the opening cut, \\"Declaration\\" revisits the sound Rick Springfield was known for back in his heyday.  \\"Come Back To Me\\" is the best song here with interesting lyrics (When you find you/come back to me), while \\"Life On The Moon\\" tries too hard to make a statement.<br /><br />The album sort of drags towards the end with too many soundalike ballads, but Cook's howling emotional vocals somehow save the day.  Overall, a good start for this year's American Idol winner.  However, a fine-tuning is an order for the next album so that Cook won't sound so dated.
B00005JPS8|4.0|We totally enjoyed the 2 disc Collector's Edition DVD.  The extra material is interesting and fills in a lot of the back story that is not seen in the feature.  Action scenes are well done and there is enough comic relief to keep it fun.
B00006D295|5.0|I ordered  this about a week before Halloween hoping to get it in time.  Im in Iraq so I didnt think it would arrive but it only took  a few day and everything came in great condition.  I was very pleased with everything
B001GQACGO|2.0|1st, My disclaimer.. I LOVE Beyonce, have always supported her and feel that she is a true performer! She is unique and represents HTown (my city) well. She is constantly evolving and should have longevity in this industry.  However, this cd was a dissapointment in every sense of the word.  There was not enough quality material to warrant a double disc.   The 1st disc (slow ballads)was the better disc in my opinion. \\"If I were a boy\\" - I love the song and love that she came with someething completely different- it works well and tells a great story. \\"Halo\\" & \\"Disappear\\" were also good tracks in my opinion. \\"Broken hearted girl\\" sounds like the previous tracks, nothing really new there.   The second disc includes the single \\"Single Ladies\\" which seems to go over well in the clubs/dance floors. \\"Scared of Lonely\\" is also a nice slower track. Outside of those 2 tracks the second disc is garbage in my opinion. On \\"Radio\\" \\"Diva\\" \\"Video Phone\\"- it seems that she is trying TOO hard to distinguish \\"Sasha\\" from \\"Beyonce\\"- she gives us a \\"around the way girl\\" that comes off forced and fake.. its not her & doesnt work well. Overall, Im glad someone bought the cd for me b/c its not worth my hard earned money. Even though i enjoyed the first disc i would still like to see more emotion in her songs. I want to be able to feel the emotion (ex. Dangerously in Love-Bey, Heaven Sent or I Remember-Keyshia Cole) This is a cd to put on when im just around the house cleaning up but it gets no play in my car. I expected more..

I was initially disappointed that the story didn't pick up where it left off, but once I got into it, it was so much better!  Again, the architectural details and Follett's ability to really \\"put you in the story\\" is the best part.

B0015FML06|5.0|Two of things that make U2 such as special band is their passion and energy. While these traits are present on their studio albums, they come to the front in their live performances. Under A Blood Red Sky perfectly captures all their raw emotions and energy. The album opens with the soaring \\"Gloria\\" from their October album and then sieges into \\"11 O'Clock Tick Tock\\". Next is a scorching version of their first hit \\"I Will Follow\\". \\"Party Girl\\" is a great lost U2 song. It was originally issued as a b-side and available on imports only. It starts off with just the Edge strumming his guitar and builds up to a powerful crescendo. Bono states on the record that \\"Sunday Bloody Sunday\\" is not a rebel song, but it is definitely an anthem. Bono has always had a bit of a preacher in him and as he urges the crowd to chant \\"no more\\", the album takes on the feel of an old time revival. After whipping things up to a fever pitch, \\"The Electric Co.\\" and \\"New Year's Day\\" follow and they mellow things out. The hymn-like \\"40\\" is the final track and the album ends on a poignant note with just the crowd singing the chorus. For those of you who may only be familiar with the U2 of the 90's and their mammoth Pop Mart and Zooropa concerts, this album is a fine sampler of their earlier efforts. While the approach is simpler in nature, it produces just as big of a sound. This deluxe edition is superb on several levels.  First it contains the full concert video presented for the first time on dvd.  The visual setting of the band in this breath-taking amphitheater perfectly compliments the music.  The picture is crisp and clean with the sound being excellent.  Then there is the packaging that has the cd and dvd housed in what looks like a hard covered book.  The booklet contains a lengthy text as well as rare photos including ones from a different set of shows at Colorado State University.
B000MNP2KI|5.0|Some years ago i read the \\"Casino Royale\\" book and since then i always wondered why this excellent first James Bond book never was considered for filming. Finally it came to theaters and i have to say i liked it very much, this is a much more human Bond and not the \\"always with the situation under control\\" Bond from all the previous films. I dont mean these where not good, it's simply that this is a more realistic film about how a spy whould be like, not super handsome, not always perfet tuxedo, not always choosing the right desitions and for the first time he couldn't save his girl and saw her die. I just can't wait for the release of Quantum of Solace wich starts where \\"Casino Royale\\" ended.
015206396X|4.0|Graceling was enjoyable enough to get me to finish the book, though i have a few complaints. I love a novel that allows the reader to relate to the heroine and to put oneself in her position, but i didn't feel that connection with Katsa and her not narrating didn't help the situation, and a there were some pages of unessential information. On a good note I was pleased to read about Katsa's strength, its not many times you read about a women being physically stronger than men or even the hero(Prince Po), by the way whom i loved! Prince Po is such an attractive character. His humility, passion and love will have me reading the other books in the trilogy.      All in all i recommend Graceling for those who crave an easy fantasy read!
0525478183|4.0|Quentin \\"Q\\" Jacobsen and Margo Roth Spiegelman were playmates and next door neighbors until they grew up and grew apart. In high school, Q worships her hotness from afar. Then one night during their senior year, Margo climbs through his bedroom window and back into his life. Dressed like a ninja, she demands he accompany her on a hair-raising escapade. After a night of mischief and mayhem - but no breaking and entering - during which Margo breaks up with her boyfriend, Q actually believes he might have a chance with her. Instead, the next day she disappears.<br /><br />The mystery of Margo becomes Q's obsession, giving new meaning to the term girl-chasing. Did she join the circus? A-gain? Or get swallowed up in the Big Apple? Or is she just hiding out in a \\"pseudovision\\" (abandoned subdivision), watching him? Or was it suicide?<br /><br />But the biggest question of all is whether the real live Margo can hold a torch to the Margo of Q's imagination. Or does reality bite?<br /><br />Sprinkled with amazing fun facts and little-known lore, \\"Paper Towns\\" is a sometimes hilarious - sometimes poignant road trip through the teenage condition toward self discovery.
B001ANYDAO|4.0|In this the third of his \\"how come things are the way they are\\" books, Malcolm Gladwell takes apart success, drilling down to the determinants of extraordinary achievement.<br /><br />Is it nature, nurture, neither, or both that leads to human achievement outside the bounds of what might normally be expected? Gladwell embarks on a scavenger hunt for patterns beneath the surface of success in this thoroughly engaging quest for answers to a perennially problematic question.<br /><br />It's an interesting and engrossing read, touching on a wide cross section of outstanding endeavor - Mozart, Bill Gates, the Beatles, Robert Oppenheimer, the list goes on and on.<br /><br />And sure enough, Gladwell uncovers systems and process underpinnings that certainly seem to contribute to the achievements surveyed in the book.<br /><br />We learn for instance of the Matthew Effect, manifested in the fact that it is those who are initially successful that are most likely to be given the kinds of opportunities that lead to further success. An interesting example of this is found in the number of hockey players born in the early months of the year. Logically they would be more developmentally advanced than their peers born later in the year in a system in which evaluation takes place within sets of a given age group. As a result the older group in the given class is favored, and voila - produces a preponderance of otherwise inexplicable hockey talent.<br /><br />Other factors contributing to success include the \\"ten-thousand-hour rule\\" (successful people practice a lot), various matters relating to context (being in the right place at the right time), and so on.<br /><br />While all this is interesting enough, ultimately it reinforces a sense that human greatness eludes this kind of analysis. Sure there are patterns in the stories that Gladwell chooses to tell. But if this is so, he's not really dealing with \\"outliers\\", to the degree that these are indeed observations outside of the sampling or set of normal outcomes that one might expect a system to produce.<br /><br />I wish the author would have delved into examples of greatness beyond these boundaries - true \\"black swans\\" whose achievement is totally unexpected, and could never be predicted. Einstein is an example of such a phenomenon. Unfortunately, he gets only a single passing mention.<br /><br />This having been said, I recommend the book. It's entertaining and certainly gets the reader thinking about what sets high achievers apart.<br /><br />Now, turning to Gladwell himself, it seems he's Canadian. Can we therefore safely assume that he's also a hockey player?<br /><br />OK - so when's his birthday???mpling or set of normal outcomes that one might expect a system to produce.<br /><br />I wish the author would have delved into examples of greatness beyond these boundaries - true \\"black swans\\" whose achievement is totally unexpected, and could never be predicted.

B001ACH4DS|5.0|Cook proves his mettle as an out-of-the-box talent with this ambitious collection of radio-friendly songs. The record unfolds as a series of something-for-everybody delights, from the emphatic \\"Declaration\\" through the retro-80s \\"Light On,\\" crunchy aggro rocker \\"Bar-Ba-Sol,\\" hooky ballad \\"Lie\\" and the achingly spare and painful \\"Permanent.\\" Throughout, Cook's trademark velvet-and-sandpaper vocals provide a visceral punch, elaborating themes of displacement and love. \\"A Daily AntheM,\\" with its earworm of a final chorus, is destined to be a concert closer for years to come. All in all, \\"David Cook The Record\\" is a savvy exercise in pleasing a diverse fan community, proving that Cook's smart choices on American Idol weren't just a fluke.
B0014DZ2VO|1.0|\\"Quantum of Solace\\" is so incredibly bad, I can't even describe it. Everything about the movie is awful, from the lame opening sequence and crappy Alicia Keys theme song to the nonexistent storyline and pathetic excuses for Bond girls and villains. I won't even attempt to describe the plot because \\"Quantum\\" really doesn't have one, and every single new character introduced in this film is boring and annoying. It's a real shame, because this movie followed \\"Casino Royale,\\" which is one of the best Bond films ever made. Daniel Craig makes an excellent James Bond, and it's not his fault that this film is a complete failure. The screenplay itself is a joke, and I don't think anything could have saved this movie. When I was sitting in the theatre, it didn't even feel like I was watching a Bond film...it was just another crappy action flick and a waste of the $19 I spent on two tickets. What a huge disappointment. I hope the producers get a fresh supply of working brain cells and make the next installment in the Bond series a decent one, or they'll be screwed.

0030565812|5.0|If you read only one autobiography this year, I recommend this one.<br /><br />Leadership breakthroughs are few and far between. They are even rarer in the political arena. Although I had closely followed the path to an integrated democracy in South Africa (and worked hard on the anti-apartheid sanctions and boycotts), much of Nelson Mandela's struggle was hidden to me at the time. Only after the reconciliation had gone on for a number of years did it become apart how remarkable this man's contribution has been.<br /><br />Recently, I read Playing the Enemy which described some of the nuances in how Mandela conceived of creating a peaceful transition through an unauthorized sole negotiation from a prison cell. Those stories impressed me even more. Now, I had to read the autobiography. And I'm glad I did.<br /><br />Let me warn you, however, that Nelson Mandela is so self-effacing that the real story of what he accomplished and how he did it doesn't fully come through in the autobiography, Long Walk to Freedom. I recommend that you read [[ASIN:1594201749 Playing the Enemy: Nelson Mandela and the Game That Made a Nation]] first.<br /><br />What the autobiography will do is show the cultural and social backgrounds of the struggle and how critical it was that Mandela be a man of honor, principle, and loyalty. He was a leader for the whole nation even when many people didn't want him to be in the nation. It's a remarkable way to be, a way that few people can accomplish.<br /><br />The apartheid system was as vile a way to treat citizens as anything that has come along since Germany in the 1930s. It's hard to imagine that it arose after World War II and was so difficult to break.<br /><br />The treatment of the African National Congress's leaders will appall you. Their grace will delight you.<br /><br />May every nation have a Nelson Mandela to lead it!

0316143472|4.0|Laugh at yourself and the whole world laughs with you. It's hard to write humorous essays that stand the test of time. Will Rogers realized that and just read the newspaper to audiences while adding an occasionally wry quip to get huge laughs. Put those messages into a book, and they wouldn't have lasted.<br /><br />I haven't heard David Sedaris perform in person (which he does as readings), but I'm told he's marvelous. If you have had that pleasure, you will undoubtedly hear his voice, know his timing, and see his expressions as you read this witty, self-deprecating book. I suspect that such an imagined performance would easily turn this into a five-star book.<br /><br />Proust waxed poetic about his memories of a madeleine (a shell-shaped cake in the France of his youth) in stream of consciousness prose. Sedaris does the same thing for a painful boil on his derriere, his horrible inability to learn new languages, and his desire to show a little more plumpness in his derriere. The results are equally memorable . . . but much more amusing in the case of Sedaris.<br /><br />Sedaris likes to put together mosaics of seemingly unconnected memories that when combined show a different image and send a different message. It's a little like a Chuck Close portrait.<br /><br />Like the best humorists, he takes us into her personal life . . . into the kinds of details that few of us would openly share with the public. In exchange for yielding his privacy, he helps us see ourselves in his experiences. Who hasn't struggled with a foreign language with embarrassing consequences? Who hasn't wanted to be a little more in some aspect of their lives? Who hasn't had trouble getting rid of a bad habit?<br /><br />These themes and more are explored in well-written, interesting style that lacks only an overriding sense of meaning (other than that we are all a mess) to be important prose. Some of them are hilarious, breaking into images of burlesque skits in your mind. Others are more poignant than funny, using wry humor. But he mostly doesn't stretch; rather, he expresses who he is and how he sees life.<br /><br />As a former smoker, former heavy drinker, former drug user, and current homosexual with a fascination for feeding spiders, some aspect of his life will intersect with yours. But at the same time, he has exotic tastes (spending a lot of time in Normandy, learning not to smoke in Tokyo, and traveling from city to city reading his essays while staying at the finest hotels) that will make his lens different than yours.

0380977273|2.0|When I heard that my book club had chosen this book for our October reading with the idea of reading a creepy, Halloween-esc story, I was thrilled.  I later found out that Something Wicked This Way Comes is often considered a genre book for horror.  Even better.  On top of all that, Ray Bradbury is a well-known author whose works are held in high regard.  I was eager to dive into the book and went in with high expectations.     I was severely disappointed.     The overall idea of the book is really quite intriguing.  A creepy carnival that feeds off of its customer's inner fears and insecurities mysteriously rolls into town before Halloween.  Two boys know something's not right and set out to foil the evil that has invaded their small town.  There's a lot of potential for an amazing story.      However, the writing really ruined it.      The style and overall writing struck me as overly poetic, clunky, and self-indulgent.  Creating a captivating, bone-chilling setting is an essential for making a good horror.  However, metaphors heaped on top of analogies do not a good setting description make.  There was often so much description going on that I lost track of what exactly was going on plot-wise.  It always seemed like there was more happening that there actually was.  There were also a lot of sentences that contained prose like \\"He saw.  He didn't see.  He thought.  He didn't think.  He heard.  He didn't hear.\\"  At first, such prose was interesting and new.  But it got really old, really fast.  I respect Ray Bradbury as an author and I respect that all authors have their own, individual writing styles.  However, the writing style really killed this book.      The first fifty pages or so were actually quite well done.  The scene settings were captivating and the way Bradbury set the characters of the two boys up was masterful.  Then, the whole thing went downhill for the next 150 pages or so.  The boys became really bland and hard to relate to and the writing got soclunky and confusing that it was difficult to figure out what was going on plot-wise.  The last 50 pages picked back up and ended the book solidly enough with a satisfying conclusion.  It was just a matter of slogging through the middle to get there.     It really is a pity that the writing style ruined the book as much as it did because the idea behind it is truly intriguing and interesting.  I haven't read a lot of Ray Bradbury's works, but I hope this is one of his worst and that his other works are far better.
0670019925|5.0|Other reviews provide ample information about the plot, setting, and characters of DEAF SENTENCE, David Lodge's fourteenth and most recent novel.  I write mostly to note that DEAF SENTENCE is a very well written and structured novel.  It betokens that Lodge certainly is not slipping; if anything, he has become even more accomplished as a novelist.  Further, DEAF SENTENCE has a depth that I do not remember from the four or so earlier novels of his that I read.<br /><br />DEAF SENTENCE begins as a clever and funny novel about the confusions and travails of being very hard of hearing, as told by a retired professor (Desmond Bates) who, in addition to being nearly deaf, is mildly vexed in other ways by advancing age, retirement, and family, especially younger career-oriented wife and very elderly father.  Towards the middle of the novel, the pace threatens to bog down in everyday minutia but Lodge manages to push and/or pull the reader through.  Then, in its last quarter, the novel changes tone and character, the humor recedes to be replaced by love and understanding, and the preoccupations of Desmond Bates (and the themes of the novel) become death and life.  At the end, DEAF SENTENCE is both poignant and exceedingly humane.  What began as something of a comedy goes out on a serious but by no means tragic note.  An excellent novel.
B001L63JC8|5.0|Like Yes' Tales From Topographic Oceans, this is a \\"concept album\\" and a rather lengthy one that also led to a new direction for Genesis and the departure of Peter Gabriel. Unlike Tales (which I think has it's brilliant moments) this is a solid work that holds up really well after all these years. It's the story of Rael, a young spraycan wielding truant, who undergoes a transformative journey beneath the Great White Way. What it all means is quite up to interpretation and I certainly won't attempt that here. But it is fascinating in concept and execution.<br />  At times it is bizarre (The Colony of Slippermen comes to mind), at times quite accessible (Carpet Crawlers and Counting Out Time became Genesis concert staples for years after) but almost always musically and dramatically interesting. I particularly enjoy listening to this around Halloween -- there are some wonderfully creepy atmospherics by Tony Banks on this. A weird and wonderful ride and definitely a great blast from the past -- Peter Gabriel at his creative height. I think trying to pull this off in concert was the straw that broke the relationship between Mr. Gabriel and the rest of the band that wanted to go in a more pop direction. This is a seminal moment in prog rock history and not to be missed.

B001FSDOZO|5.0|I tend to prefer the milder side of Nickelback and avoid the harder, edgier songs.  I thought this album had a good mix of ballads, just plain fun songs, and the hardcore/traditional Nickelback that old fans seem to prefer.  I don't listen to a lot of music in this realm, but this album has enough to make me feel it's worthwhile.  I can avoid the songs I don't like and still have enough to entertain me.  It's definitely worth trying out.  I think even those who wouldn't usually consider listening to a group like Nickelback would find something here to satisfy them.    I've bought CD's in my usual realm of music choice (much milder rock and country) with less to like on them than Dark Horse.  Nickelback isn't my usual pick for music choice, but this CD I like...a lot.

B0014DZ2VO|1.0|I've been a Bond movie fan since I saw my first at age 10. It was in a theatre, the theatrical release of GOLDFINGER, in my area. You can imagine the impact that film had at the time, arguably one of the most popular of the series, that still holds up today. Since then, I've looked forward to each new Bond film with eager anticipation and I've seen the highs and the lows, as the series has adjusted to the changing times.    I can say that with even the worst of the Bond films, there was always quality and entertainment. You got an enjoyable time at the movies and the money spent by the producers to make the film always showed up on the screen.    Until now.    QUANTUM OF SOLACE is bad film making from beginning to end. Even for an action thriller, not a Bond film, which it aspires to be, it stinks. Terrible MTV - style editing so that the \\"action\\" sequences come across as a confused blur. Bad writing, with no discernable continuity. Wretched film locales like Haiti and Bolivia, where the poverty is so bad that Bond and his cohorts, running around dressed-to-the-nines, just appear rediculous. No opening \\"gun barrel\\" sequence, just a right-in-your-face wacky-cam car chase down a mountain and the worst title sequence with the most annoying title \\"song\\" imaginable. Unattractive, boring \\"Bond girls\\".    I should add to this review that I am not a Bond \\"purist\\". I don't need the gadgets, brainless bimbos and world threatening death rays and such. As a matter of fact, my favorite Bond film is LICENSE TO KILL, which, akin to 2006's CASINO ROYALE, is probably closer to reality than most others in the series. I love what Daniel Craig did in his first outing, breathing new life into the character of James Bond, and so it was with much excitement that I awaited this continuance of the new era of 007.    What a letdown.    To sum it all up, this movie is no fun at all... and in a Bond movie, that's unforgiveable.
B001GQACGE|3.0|Everyone's favorite Destiny's Child and American gangsta wife has always had sort of a split personality: from the naïve singer from Dreamgirls to the vivacious lovestruck woman in \\"Crazy in Love\\" to the defiantly independent ex on \\"Irreplaceable,\\" Beyonc&eacute; has always been able to fit into many different personas. Her third solo record, I Am...Sasha Fierce takes Beyonc&eacute;'s image of herself to new heights, a two-CD affair that is divided according to different aspects of the diva's personality. While more than a little unnecessary (the regular set clocks in at a mere thirteen songs total) and fairly two-dimensional, it does do an excellent job of splitting the CDs into separate genre exercises, each with their own accomplishments and pitfalls.<br /><br />The I Am... portion is the starting disc, a seven-song collection of mostly down-tempo R&B ballads that focus more on Beyonc&eacute;'s still-powerful voice and various standard pop themes of love, heartbreak, and self-empowerment. There is nothing fairly exceptional here, something which one could potentially say about the entire record, as Beyonc&eacute; sings in pretty much the same mode throughout the half. She does manage to restrain her pipes more than she has before, and on songs like the opening \\"If I Were A Boy\\" (easily the best on this half), the lyrics, simple beat, and Beyonc&eacute;'s upfront performance make for an affecting pop ballad. \\"Halo,\\" originally intended for Leona Lewis, is another surefire hit, built on top of a synth-and-hand-clap rhythm and an instantly memorable chorus.<br /><br />Sasha Fierce, Beyonc&eacute;'s apparently random designation for her more wild personality, is, to no one's surprise, much more entertaining than the first half, although it has its share of misses. Opener \\"Single Ladies (Put A Ring On It),\\" is almost unbearably repetitive, but the following electro-pop \\"Radio\\" more than makes up for it with a synth-heavy, slinky beat and a respectable hook. The disc never really builds up any momentum as song alternate between terribly uneven and uninspired (\\"Diva,\\" the quite creepy \\"Video Phone\\"), to groovy, immediately catchy jams like \\"Sweet Dreams.\\"<br /><br />Unfortunately, there is nothing here as monumentally poppy as \\"Crazy In Love\\" or as memorable as \\"Irreplaceable,\\" and sadly I Am...Sasha Fierce comes off as lesser than the sum of its parts. While an interesting concept, neither CD contains enough strong material to match up to either of her previous releases, and at times, the constant barrage of R&B clich&eacute;s and adult-contemporary production make it sound like Beyonc&eacute; is rapidly transforming from hot, hip pop goddess to your standard bored diva. Maybe it's the married life or the fact that Beyonc&eacute; has already proved herself beyond any shadow of a doubt as the reigning R&B queen in recent memory, but she would do well to shake things up for her next move lest she risk becoming irrelevant and (dare I say it?) old-fashioned.te between terribly uneven and uninspired (\\"Diva,\\" the quite creepy \\"Video Phone\\"), to groovy, immediately catchy jams like \\"Sweet Dreams.\\"     Unfortunately, there is nothing here as monumentally poppy as \\"Crazy In Love\\" or as memorable as \\"Irreplaceable,\\" and sadly I Am...Sasha Fierce comes off as lesser than the sum of its parts.

1400032717|5.0|I was recommended this book in a book group, and it was great! Very easy read but makes you really think! It brings you into the mind of a boy who is almost trapped in his, lets you in on his quirks, and his pain. Definitely a must read!
B0001US8EO|5.0|In a recent interview on the \\"Director's\\" series on  TV, Lawrence  Kasdan noted that Kevin Costner was already well into production on  this \\"series\\", when he asked Kasdan to come on as Director. Costner  was preparing a mini-series for HBO of \\"Earp\\", and, when that fell  through he needed help in reshaping it as a movie. Kasdan did what  he could, but it was too late to do very much in the way of cutting  the series down. Other: I love this film, and I love the fact that  Earp never took a bullet, lived to a ripe old age, and was buried in  a Jewish cemetary near San Francisco near his wife \\"Josie\\"...RIP
B001GQACGO|4.0|One of the most anticipated releases and worth the wait. Beyonce is a really talented person and has really made it look so easy, relatable yet so unique throughout her music career. She has gone through different phases in her career while remaining down-to-earth. I picked up the Deluxe edition yesterday and i imported into my i-Pod after listening to the entire album last night.     The strongest of the two discs is the 1st disc which is mostly slow ballads which are really becoming her strong suit, vocally and expressively. This portion of the album is 4 stars by itself and is a better follow up than B'Day.    I fell in love with \\"If I Were A Boy\\" after I first saw the video. Alot of people were hating on the song just from the title itself, stating that she was biting off of Ciara not realizing that Beyonce career started while Ciara was still pushing pom pom's in high school. Then there was of course the obligatory hateration with the song itself, people saying that she stole the song which was also another piece of hateration. She did the song up, BC Jean did the song up on the demo and it's alot more mature than what people might think when comparing it to Ciara's song of the same time and even one of Beyonce's more mature material in general.     \\"Halo\\" didn't take long to grow on me, the instrumental and the layering in the production is very solid and the lyrical content is clever and flows very nicely after \\"If I Were A Boy\\". You really start to get a sense of the direction of the 1st CD after listening to this.    \\"Disappear\\" is another one of my favorites, it's a slow burn kind of record. It's never boring, or lacsadasial, she keeps the mood consistent and the lyrical content is stronger than her previous efforts but she shines through on this while keeping it refreshing at the same time.    \\"Broken-Hearted Girl\\" is hypnotizing and it sucks you in with the piano solo at the beginning and it grabs your attention if you listen closely to the lyrics. By the time I got to this song, I was starting to see that this was starting to turn out to be Beyonce's \\"The Breakthrough\\"    \\"Ave-Maria\\" is very beautiful summer-y, serene down south in the bayou kind of song. The kind of song you can play on your patio and just drift away to happier moments in your life. If you listen to the song, it almost sounds like a remake and it sounds alot like a wedding song. Very nice touch    \\"Smash Into You\\" comes out strong and she really puts her soul into this song while not going entirely into \\"Ring The Alarm\\" mode, vocally. She really is aiming to be more popular with this song.     When I saw the tracklisting and saw the titles of some of these songs, I thought it was going to be some corny half as$ attempted album. So when I saw \\"Satellites\\" I was like oh boy. But it's only the 1 filler on the cd but it still stacks up pretty well with the production and the vocal production.     The CD ends on a strong note with \\"That's What Makes You Beautiful\\" which is right up there with \\"Resentment\\" from her last album, nice choice.     I was a little aprehensive with the second CD \\"Sasha Fierce\\".   \\"Single Ladies\\" is a real bouncy, attitude filled song, I'm backing it up in my chair as I type this part of the review up. When I first heard the song before the video, I was like \\"Demo for sure\\" but then I saw the video, and I have this goal to have the dance down by New Year's. You Go Bey.    \\"Radio\\" is when you really get a sense that she is really trying to bring out Sasha when she actually sounds more like Tashaun from around the way with the ghetto drawl in her delivery and with that 80's inspired production. I have to give this a few more tries, nice though.     When I was on Mediatakeout last week and saw that Beyonce was rapping on this song where she's number 1 in the game (which is pretty much true among the younger female singers), I knew I had to listen to it. I really thought she was going to go off on this one and start naming names,she raps on this one and she's not exactly Brook Lynn, but it's cute and she did on that Milli-like beat. I see Sasha on this one then I do on Radio and most of the rest of the CD.     \\"Sweet Dreams\\" continues that 80's style production and her vocals grove cool with the CD and this sounds more like Beyonce than it does Sasha. Maybe if she lowered her register like Janet did on \\"Love Will Never Do Without You\\" on some of the songs on the 2nd CD and had more attitude, Sasha would be more indepedent of Beyonce. This won't take long to grow on me.     \\"Video Phone\\" sounds like the before of \\"Suga Mama\\", the chorus is a little boring and the half as$ bass can be a little annoying, it took me awhile to figure what the heck she was singing about but the vibrato keeps it interesting.     \\"Hello\\" sounds real nice, has this opera feel to it and she snaps on this song and she real takes no prisoners and is straight up on this song. The chorus can be a little annoying, if she say Hello one mo' gin LOL.    \\"Ego\\" is pretty smooth and sounds similar to \\"Body On Me\\" by Ashanti if you play close attention to the intro. Beyonce really shows alot of versatility with her delivery and it's one of my favorites.    \\"Scared Of Lonely\\" is a really nice end to the second CD. another one of my favorites.     I personally have to get used to this Sasha a little more and I think Beyonce should've waited at least another album to introduce an entire CD to Sasha. It would've been nice if Sasha was more distinguishable from Beyonce and had a bolder, more attitude personality so I'd know when she's there and when she's not. I was looking for more attitude a la \\"Kitty Kat\\" & \\"Freakum Dress\\" & \\"Upgrade U\\" on the second CD but it didn't quite mount up to that kind of attitude and the second CD in general didn't mount up to the 1st CD but it couldn't been alot worse than what it is. The thought is real nice as far as the album but I think she should've made this another 1 CD album with little hints ofSasha Fierce like she with the last album to better accumulate her fans with Sasha before devoting an entire CD to her alter ego. This sounds like another multiple-grammy nominated set.
0307455378|3.0|I bought this book after I had read LA SOMBRA DEL VIENTO written by the same author. To be honest, I liked much more La sombra del Viento, and I think that El juego del angel is a book that in general is based on the same idea of the previous one and in some way is takes the conceptual arquitecture of the one and bilds the argument of the second.  The truth is that I enjoied much more LA SOMBRA DEL VIENTO.
B0015519VS|3.0|Out of the whole album, Ionly liked 6 songs. For Usher this is not personal best. I was little dissapointed. My favorite track is the Love You Gently joint. I think it's true that once a great singer falls in love and there music before didn't route from acctual love it gets worst. I Trading Places is also a good joint. But the video for it sucked. I could have put together a better video. He had a few tracks featuring ppl but I think only the remix to love in this club wa the best one. You would be better off buying the few singles that are good than waisting your money on the whole cd.
B001JNNDBA|3.0|Film student here.  This is a good example of a modern expressionist film.  In other words, the filmmaker made it for himself, not for an audience.  And of the few people who are receptive to it, no two understandings of it are the same and certainly not the same as the filmmaker's since this is basically a look inside his own mind.  Anyone who thinks they understand this film only understands it for themselves.  I think this movie is interesting for it's bizarre way of provoking philosophical and supernatual wonder, however, do not mistake that and the plot complexity for cleverness.  This is not a 'clever' film; it's just one particular filmmaker's canvas strokes which, on the surface, is somewhat random.  (Not that there's anything wrong with that.)  A clever film would be one that has an overall conceptual or narrative hook that keeps all spectators on the same page.  (Remember, moviemaking was invented as a communal spectator medium; not a home video stoner gathering on a basement couch with friends.)  A film doesn't have to tell a coherent story or even have a story; it just has to be engaging in some way.  This movie it worth a shot if you haven't seen it, but I suggest starting with the theatrical version.      Also, the Blu-ray transfer is very unimpressive as far as picture.

0312330537|5.0|I absolutely loved this book.  It tells the story of a man, who after his marriage falls apart turns to a life of drugs and crime only to end up in a New Zeland prison.  After he escapes from the prison, he finds his way to India where he meets some extraordinary people, sets up a medical clinic in the slum where he lives, and eventually works for the mafia.  The vast majority of the novel occurs in India, with the New Zealand history revealed in flashbacks.  The characters are vivid, and you both love and hate the lead character.  I got hooked on this book from the first sentence, and loved it until the end almost 1000 pages later.      Word is that Johnny Depp is planning on making this into a movie, but it's been delayed due to some other projects.

B0000WN0ZK|5.0|Today, I will be writing a review of Michaelangelo Antonioni's 1966 film Blow-Up. It will be a meandering discourse as a means of distraction, a way of blurring my own awareness of the daily slough of lies and hate in which we drown (the news).    Please take your seats.    First, a simple question. Are you happy? It is a question much in the news. Mike Leigh's new film, Happy-Go-Lucky, is about a persistently cheerful woman. In the current off-Broadway play, Boys' Life, an adult/adolescent male tells a girl he is trying to pick up, \\"Nobody's happy. That's the way things are supposed to be.\\"    Recent studies show that people are happy in Denmark and in most Latin American countries, regardless of income. Money has very little to do with happiness, despite what Joe the Plumber may have been conditioned into believing. (Sorry, I reverted to the news there for a second.) And, I was taught in Sunday School that \\"happiness is not promised.\\"    The best series currently on television is Mad Men, set in the early 1960s at an ad agency on Madison Avenue. These ad men have plenty of money and clearly are not happy. The men and women smoke and drink constantly, while holding meetings or holding their kids. The secretaries endure endless sexual harassment as a matter of course. Women pregnant out of wedlock hide their children in shame. Black people mostly operate the elevators.    (Republicans consider these the \\"happy days,\\" speaking of which, have you seen Andy and Opie and the Fonzie's endorsement Obama?).    Then as now, the country was on the cusp of change. A great spiritual dissatisfaction with conformity erupted with the birth of a counter culture and a global explosion of culture and consciousness.    And that brings us to Blow-Up, Antonioni's famous depiction of London in the 1960s. Blow-Up is about what happened after the culture of conformity collapsed. The commentator on the DVD notes that Blow-Up is the most philosophical movie MGM ever released. Existentialismstill is a part of the vernacular and the characters in the film - like those in Mad Men - are struggling with the Beats, Jean-Paul Sartre, music, art, meaning, and reality itself. The war in Vietnam loomed over everything, even when it was suppressed into the background.    Blow-Up emerges out of the time that was lampooned in the Austin Powers movies, a time of gawdy colors, hip nonconformity, overboard pop and op fashions, marijuana parties, sexual license, rock and roll.    The most famous scene is that of the photographer (played by David Hemmings) shooting fashion model Verushka, straddling her as the two of them achieve a simulated sexual crescendo, the camera lens substituting for a phallus.    Antonioni's first color film, Blow-Up created something of a sensation when it was released, not the least for a scene of an orgy with the photographer and two teenage girls, rolling naked on a curtain of purple paper. I know that's what caused my high school friends and me to sneak into the Thunderbird Theater. But I digress.    There are innumerable iconic scenes and styles in Antonioni's masterpiece, which is itself as much a visual work of art as any of the photography or paintings depicted in the narrative. Even the opening credits - across an expanse of artificially painted green grass - set the stage for a consistent canvas of broad strokes of color. Every scene is a composition, every shot a thought.    We first meet the photographer as he is secretly taking images of down and outers in a homeless shelter. Later, he thinks he is filming a man and woman having an affair in the park, but later - upon developing the film and blowing it up over and over - concludes that he may have witnessed a murder.    Or did he? Was there a dead man in the grainy enlargement? Or just a blurry image no different from the abstract, meaningless paintings made by his artist friend?    Images may hypnotize and deceive, but so do the sounds of the film. We hear the wind blowing in the trees - the only sound during long stretches of \\"silence\\" - during the opening credits, during the episode in the park, and again at the very end of the film, a haunting, ominous reminder of our ultimate powerlessness over nature and our own natures.    Then, in shocking contrast, the photographer stumbles into a dank rock and roll cave, where an impassive audience stands inert while The Yardbirds crank out a churning number, \\"Stroll On.\\" There's Jimmy Page, biting his lip and hammering out an explosive locomotive riff! There's Jeff Beck, smashing his guitar against the amp!    Vanessa Redgrave, the woman in the clandestine affair in the park, offers herself to the photographer in his studio, trying to get him to relinquish the roll of film. He teaches her how to listen to jazz, how to smoke against, not with, the flow of the music.    And then there is the model Verushka again, as the photographer runs into her at a stoned party. No one will listen to the photographer's claim of having witnessed a murder.    \\"I thought you were supposed to be in Paris,\\" the photographer says to her.    \\"I AM in Paris,\\" she claims, delivering the best line in the script as she walks past, statuesque and in a reality all her own.    And that is the point. Nothing is real, one way or the other, in Blow-Up. In the final sequence, a mime-playing band of hippie pranksters start a game of tennis in the park, using an invisible ball. The photographer observes. The sound of the wind in the trees is all that can be heard. Or can we hear the ball bouncing in the court?    The ball is hit outside the fence to where the photographer stands. The pranksters wait for the photographer to pick it up for them. Will he? Will he play along, rejoin the living in acceptance -- or even celebration -- of life's illusion?    Is he, like the philosopher Chuang-tse, a man who dreamed he was a butterfly, or a butterfly dreaming he is a man?    I could now attempt to draw a parallel to the contemporary situation, during which we have spent eight years in the throes of lies and illusion, at the same time war wages on in a distant country. But I'm giving that a pass.    I will add, however, that the main character in Mad Men is a dissatisfied ad exec named Don Draper, someone who in fact discusses Antonioni with the woman he's having an affair with. He also is a phony, having assumed the identity of a fellow soldier who was killed when they served together in Korea. Even his wife doesn't know his real name, his real story.    This, perhaps not coincidentally, is the exact premise for Antonioni's subsequent film, The Passenger, starring Jack Nicholson, who plays a reporter interviewing an African warlord, who assumes the identity of a man who dies in his hotel room. But let us save that discourse for another day.    Last week, I got a letter from an old friend in Chicago, someone with whom I tromped through Lincoln Park, dodging tear gas, during the Festival of Life at the Chicago Democratic Convention in 1968, 40 years ago.    He wrote, \\"Tonight on TV we saw the Chicago 10 documentary. I swear I saw you in several scenes about halfway through. You are front and center in one scene wearing your helmet (I think it's you). In another, an interview with Allen Ginsberg, you are just to the right in the background. That is definitely you.\\"    I rented the DVD from Netflix and watched the scene over and over. That was definitely me, standing behind Allen Ginsberg. I think. It all seems so long ago. Was it all a dream? Are we in Paris? Am I a butterfly? Are we happy yet? Is the election over?

Every mystery fan remembers The Murder of Roger Ackroyd. Since then there have been a handful of books which stood out as outstandingly innovative while faithfully following the classic detective story rules. These are the books that leave the readers with a jolt in the solar plexus. Some do it with the climax, like Roger Ackroyd and in the 70s, Ira Levin's A Kiss Before Dying; some do it with a plot and writing that transcends the genre but staying within the rules, the unique, The Name of the Rose, by Umberto Eco.<br />Now in 2008 comes Stieg Larsson (and he died before the books were published). Most of the reviewers, including the venerable Machiko Kakutani of the NY Times tend to give away the plot. I skipped the details so that when I reached about page 253, the blow to the pit of my stomach was as hard as a Muhammad Ali punch.<br />It starts off inocuously enough. Mikael Blomkvist loses a case in court for journalistic zeal for his own publication. And we are introduced to the Girl With the Dragon Tattoo, Lisbeth Salander. Her horrible past is revealed later and the book goes forth on the sure footed prose of the writer, who without any over writing, maintains interest by plot creation and characters that are believable. No, Blomkvist is not a detective but he's piecing together a mystery that happened years ago, disappearance of young Harriet Vanger from a crowded party in a small island whose exit is cut off by an accident.<br />A classic Golden Age plot, surely.<br />Poirot had done it many times, delved into the past and came up with an answer.<br />Blomkvist reluctantly takes the job that has baffled police and everyone else for forty years.

Absolutely gorgeous without long metaphors or description of the weather. The interweaving of the characters is natural, convincing and at times produces envy.

B001GQACGO|5.0|After playing this cd several times today, I CANNOT stop listening to it.  There are a couple songs that make me feel warm and comforting and just simply blissful----Halo, Disappear, Ave Maria,Hello, Broken Hearted Girl and Satellites. I understand now what she meant by this I AM part of the cd being more revealing of where she is right now.  I get a sense that she is in a place of grown deep love and bliss - she make you want to be in love if your not.    Songs like - Single Ladies, Ego, Diva and Video Phone all songs to listen to when going out with your girls or just when you need to get your swagger on.:-)    Radio and Sweet Dreams - just cool fun soft rock songs.    Please give this project a chance. I loved it from the first go around but I understand it might take others more listening.   Great Great Work! Beyonce is still the #1 chic in the game. Enjoy it!

There is enough diversity in the songs to keep most of the songs from sounding the same although \\"Mr. Sensitive\\" is a waste of three minutes a listener will never get back in his or her life. Best songs are: \\"Declaration\\", \\"Lies\\" and \\"Permanent\\",  In fact \\"Permanent\\" is the best song that show cases why he won AI's vocal contest in the first place.    I would usually give an album like David's four stars, but I am giving him the extra star to make it five stars for the simple fact he was finally able to elbow his way through the teflon pop factory known as the American Idol producers to actually make a relevant rock album that has market success written all over it.

B000I2MRHE|2.0|The usefulness of this product really depends on the baby.  My daughter HATED tummy time and this product made no difference.  I wouldn't pay full price for this again without trying it out first.  It's a great concept, but doesn't hold up in reality.  And it would only be useful for a month or two.  Maybe the mat would be fun later without the lady bug in the middle...
B001ACH4DS|5.0|This is a great album, let alone a gread DEBUT album. This is a cohesive record and shows the incredible talent and depth to Cook's abilities. Its kind of amazing to listen to and I heard it through the first time and the only criticism I could even come up with was the basic-ness of the track right after Light On, and it turns out that was one that Cook did not write for himself, so my cricism isn't even ABOUT Cook. I look forward to his next album WITHOUT the hum-drum songs written by other people. This guy has some serious talent and should have been left alone to make his own record the way he wanted to. I'm glad they let him have as much freedom as they did.
B001ACH4DS|5.0|I have not been able to stop listening to this album.  I found myself constantly playing it over and over again and catching new things all the time.  This has something for everyone and David Cook did not disappoint at all.  You can't do wrong by buying this album.  There are no \\"skip to the next song\\" on this CD.  You get a little rock, a little pop, strong vocals, and I seriously got chills listening to it.  I just can't tell you which songs I liked and in which order.  This album is a keeper from songs like Declaration all the way to Permanent which is so moving it may make you cry.  Now here's a real winner.
0385340567|3.0|I am a big fan of Lee Child's books.  They are usually fast moving and interesting.  This title is a tad different.  It was easy to put down and in fairness, it was also easy to pick back up and get on with. However...it struck me that Child wrote this book without quite know the direction it would take.  The end seemed to me to be a tidy tying up of many loose ends, most of which were un-satisfying in their conclusion.  A big disappointment!
B0006IJ5PM|5.0|Got the product for $0.16, the shipping and handling was what killed me. Video was in perfect condition. Great deal, great movie.
B001ACH4DS|3.0|I voted for David Cook many times on American Idol.  His voice on the album is very good.  Unfortunately though, he does not have any \\"hooks\\" that make for great songs.  This one will probably end up in the pile of other average-quality discs I have bought over the years.
B001GQACGE|1.0|Before I start, I'm just gonna say I'm not an amazing reviewer, but I am going to give an honest review.<br /><br />I am definately not the biggest Beyonce fan by far, as I usually like to stray away from mainstream music as often as I can, being such over processed crap as most of it is. But this is Beyonce we're talking about, she has amazing talent, and an amazing vocal range. Which is why I'm so appalled that she had the audacity to release such an album. It's almost like she's saying, \\"I'm Beyonce, I'm amazing, and people will jump on anything I create, so why even make an attempt.\\"<br />I'm one of the idiots who purchased the deluxe album, and after unwrapping it at home and actually checking out the track listing and such, all of these songs could have DEFINATELY fit onto one album. There was nothing deluxe about it.<br />After listening to the first disc, I almost felt I had to check my stereo to make sure I didn't have the same song on repeat over and over. The entire first disc is nothing but power ballads, that lack just that, power. There was no emotion, they all sounded exactly the same: bland, dull, and over-polished. It made me feel like she went into the studio and just recorded each track to the same intrumental, back to back, and called it a night.<br /><br />The second disc I'm assuming was supposed to be the disc with club anthems, party songs and such. It had the typical \\"independent\\" ladies song, and the typical \\"boast like a man\\" song. I forced myself through the whole thing just to say I gave it a shot.  Basically the only song worth anything on this entire collection is the song \\"Single Ladies\\", which I'm still not bananas about.<br />Beyonce, you're incredible, but this album was a slap in the face to all of your fans and anyone who even mildly liked you. Giving it two stars is generous, and I wasn't in the mood.<br /><br />It definately seems like I'm bashing Beyonce in this review, but I'm not bashing her, I'm bashing her feeble effort in this album release. I'm sure she'll notice the poor feedback from this cd and the next will be incredible. She should definately take her time and create an album with songs that have some staying power. Because if there ever was a Beyonce album to forget in the dust it's definately this one.ll notice the poor feedback from this cd and the next will be incredible.

B001FSDOZO|2.0|I find this to be a very sub-par effort from Nickelback. Sure there are plenty of radio friendly hits on the cd, but the harder songs are very immature at best and many times just plain stupid.  Instead of evolving the band has falling into the pit of creating music just to sell cds.  I hope this cd is just a blemish on what has been an outstanding career.  Out of all their cds, I think this is barely better than their first cd, Curb.  I'm very disappointed.

B001GQACGO|3.0|It's not like I was expecting something like 'Dangerously in Love' but I was expecting more range and less yodeling. (Keep it real, yall know she yodels!)There was sooo much techno and I kinda see where she was trying to go creatively but it really didn't wow you because it really wasn't different. It was more of the same from a different artist.It's not going to kill you to listen to the whole cd, but out of 18 tracks, there will only be a few that you'll actually sing along with.
0880796863|2.0|The artwork on these cards is not as clear as I would have liked.  Must be something about the prints, but the lines are so thick in places you can't make out the elements of the scenes and the colors are terribly splotchy.  The point of the art is the fine detail and symbolism packed into each piece, and this set loses so much of that.
B001ACH4DS|5.0|Watching American Idol 2008 was an amazing experience.  There were some wonderful voices but one person stood out for me and evidently for America too.   A young rocker with a wonderful raspy honey toned voice and an amazing ability to convert any dated arrangement into a modern track that would top the charts today.  He was able to connect to the audience in such an amazing way.  Week after week he took an unlikely song and with a canny ability to choose the right one, amazed us.  Even on the topical evening of Broadway, he reverted to type and thrilled us once again with a beautiful rendition, no hint of a rock tinge.    Once again he has enraptured me.  This album brings to the fore the wonderful voice, the amazing ability to write beautiful lyrics and the essense of this erudite and delightful young man.   Each song has its own charm, and just when you think you have found your favourite, you continue and find another one even better.   From the outstanding and beautiful Permanent, with only strings, piano and that gorgeous voice which grabs your heart and twists it, to the pulsating and fascinating Bar-ba-Sol which gets you on your feet.  Then the beautiful Avalanche with his wonderful falsetto, Lie which is one of the best tracks on the record.   Another amazing anthemic song Heroes, and David's Declaration to his fans, another fantastic song.   I love Come Back to Me and I Did It For You as well.  And then we have the futuristic Man on the Moon and Mr Sensitive which Cook has claimed is one of his favourites.  Added to that the track known as ADAM (A Daily Anthem), which was written in honour of his brother.  I love the lead single, Light On and his coronation single Time of My Life which is due to go platinum very shortly, either this week or next.    Congratulations David and the team on this amazing album.   A solid contribution to the lovers of rock music.
031606792X|1.0|**SPOILERS***     Like many others, I was so VERY disappointed with this book. Where did the characters we love go? Where did the beautiful love story go? The characters were one dimensional and obnoxious and the story was boring and weird. It made me wonder if the author has strange hang ups about sex. In the other three books, the kissing scenes were nice for the most part (until Edward would have his intense mood swings... guilt, anger, etc.). In this book, the scenes of intimacy were almost absent. Edward and/or Bella would mention that they are horny and then the next sentence would be them subtley referring to the sex that already happened... so weird and disappointing! For a love so intense and so \\"true\\", why are we not allowed any glimpse into the consumation of this love? The characters are married so it wouldn't be promoting immoral acts. I'm not even suggesting a smutty harlequin romance scene, but come on! Give us something!     And then there were the two weirdest/creepiest parts of the book... these have both been mentioned ad nauseum in other reviews, but I still MUST touch on them. The first, of course, is Edward tearing some pillows and the headboard to pieces during sex. So embarrasing and unsexy!!! I get that he was into it, but seriously? That is the only imagery she gives us about their first time together??? I just pictured Edward shaking the pillows in his mouth like a dog while having sex. Weird. The second and far more creepier scene was when Jacob imprinted on Renesme. Um what was THAT? And I wanted to punch Jake in the face when he was acting like the kid was his. He wouldn't even let mommy Bella hold her!! Oh and sidenote... why didn't they think of injecting venom before?? That would have solved the whole problem of Edward accidentally killing her instead of changing her into a vampire. And the author barely glazes over it. It was a huge difference from what the audience was expecting! Personally, I expected to read about Edward biting her and having all this internal struggle to not kill her. But whatever, that was the least of the unbeleivable parts of this book.     How about the fact that Bella has NO problems when she is a newborn vampire. She had no patience or self control as a human, how could she have an extraordinary amount as a vampire?? No out of control cravings... nothing? The author made her more in control than even Carlisle, who has been a vampire since the 17th century! So disappointing all around. Where was the struggle? The tragic flaw? Ugh!!! Now I kinda wish that Edward would have accidentally screwed Bella to death. At least that would have made it more interesting... and beleivable actually.     If you MUST read this book, check it out of the library. Don't waste the cash.
B000SFJWLU|2.0|If you're at all familiar with the early 2000's hard-rock/metal band Flaw, you already know what FFDP are about. The single The Bleeding is practically a carbon copy of Flaw's Payback from Through The Eyes, with it's soft melodic verses and screamy hard hitting chorus. The two vocalists even sound somewhat alike, although Chris Volz (Flaw) is much more dynamic. It isn't just Flaw that FFDP are borrowing from, though. Traces of Slipknot and the like can be heard all throughout this ten track disc. And it's not just the fact that FFDP are generic either. I can deal with a less original sound, as long as it's done well. Most of the songs here seem to always fall short of reaching any sort of dynamic, either ending too soon in the chrous' or failing to ever take off. Quality is hard to come by, in Metal especially, and FFDP don't contribute anything here to change that. They're too brooding for the core kids, too generic for the metal purists, and simply aren't focused or accessible enough to keep the attention of fairweather listeners.
B001GZ6QC4|2.0|If you put aside the spectacular special effects, terrific car-chase scenes and Heath Ledger's extraordinary performance, all you're left with is a very predictable story.  I saw more strategy displayed in a checkers game at Washington Square Park in New York than I did in this movie.  No wonder this movie was rated PG-13: it was meant for the intellect of a grade school student (with no offense to them).  However, the violence is not meant for a 13-year old.  (And then we wonder why there are so many student shootings at high schools and colleges.)  It's kinda ironic that \\"Brokeback Mountain\\" was rated R and this movie was rated PG-13.  Instead of wasting your money on this movie, check out \\"Entre Les Murs,\\" which won the Best Picture at the Cannes Film Festival this year.  That film will give you very good insight on what grade school students are like in any country.  Maybe you'll understand why movies like \\"The Dark Knight\\" causes students to behave as they do in movies like \\"Entre Les Murs.\\"
B00003CXBH|5.0|I watched The Mission in a class that I'm currently taking about the Literature of Human Rights in Latin America.  The Mission is about the colonial time in South America and shows the treatment of indigenous people and human rights. If we really focus on this movie as a human rights oriented, we could see how the Indians were being treated by the Europeans. They would capture, slave them, exploit them, and the Indians have no saying in the matter; for the Europeans they were like animals, they have no voice, they were nothing.  So they could do as they wished with them.  On the other hand there were the Jesuits who saw them as humans who needed guidance, understanding, someone who needed to be converted into Christianity, trying to save them.  I see this movie as a way to create awareness about the violation of human rights, to create consciousness. To make us realize that we are the only ones who can change the injustice in our society.  Honestly for anyone who likes a good movie, this is the one. This is a movie that transcends the years and its idea can be applied to our time.  In my opinion this movie tries to influence of emotions and feelings to make us think about the current situations that our world is in terms of human rights, because we are the only ones who can change the present and provide a better future by looking at the past.      Miré la misión en una clase que estoy tomando actualmente sobre la literatura de los derechos humanos en América latina. La misión es sobre el tiempo de la colonia en Suramérica y muestra el tratamiento de indígenas y de los derechos humanos. Si nos centramos realmente podemos ver que esta  se orienta mucho en mostrar los derechos humanos, podemos ver cómo a los europeos trataban a los indios.   Los capturaban, los esclavizan,  los explotan, y los indios no podían defenderse; para los europeos ellos eran como animales, ellos no tenían ninguna voz, no eran nada. Podían hacer con ellos los que les daba la gana.Por otro lado estaban los jesuitas que los miraban como seres humanos que necesitaban de dirección, comprensión, los veían como alguien que necesitaba ser convertido al cristianismo, intentando salvarlos.  Veo esta película como una manera de informar sobre la violación de los derechos humanos, para crear concientización.  Para que nos demos cuenta que somos los únicos que podemos cambiar la injusticia en nuestra sociedad.  Honesto para cualquier persona que tenga gusto de una buena película, ésta es esa película.  Ésta es una película que trasciende los años y su idea se puede aplicar a nuestro tiempo. En mi opinión esta película intenta influenciar nuestras emociones y sentimientos para hacernos pensar en las situaciones actuales de nuestro mundo en términos de los derechos humanos, porque somos los únicos que podemos cambiar el presente y proveer un futuro mejor mirando el pasado.
B0013FSL3E|5.0|Forget the fact that it's a cartoon, Wall-E is simply one of the best movies I've seen.  Written beautifully, with seamless animation, and with direction that brings storytelling to a new level, this movie engulfs you into the life of one little forgotten robot.      There is something so pure about Wall-E. There's not a selfish gear or wire in his entire little trash-compacting body. His only goal is to serve, help, and love - truly the most selfless character ever portrayed on the screen.  And as it turns out, he's the wisest character in the movie, simply because of the fact that he follows his heart. It's this kind of altruism that leads to greatness. Can one little robot save the human race?.....This one can.    In my eyes, he is one of the most hopeful characters on film.  He can be put in the same category as Atticus Finch in To Kill A Mockingbird, Andy Dufresne in Shawshank Redemption, or Roberto Benigni in Life is Beautiful. All characters that never give up hope because they see that life is indeed too beautiful to waste on selfishness and waste. And all characters that can reach through the screen and inspire the viewers to become something better than they are.  For Wall-E, not only is the glass half full, but he's always striving to fill the other half.    Wall-E's my hero.  Watch this movie and he'll become your hero too.

B000VSBX34|5.0|I don't know why it took me so long to watch/purchase this movie. I am a Beatles freak and own every album and had seen Hard Day's Night, but until this reissue of Help! I just hadn't taken the time to check it out. But I have to say that I liked this movie MORE than Hard Day's Night. The gorgeous color and fun storyline were highly entertaining! This is my kind of movie. Quick little one liners, and funny little bits that if you blink you might miss them. Which also makes this film ideal for repeat viewing. The visuals are just outstanding, vibrant colors and great scenery! I highly recommend this film to even the most casual Beatle fan (if there is such a thing!!)

0316017922|5.0|Bad points: (None)<br /><br />Good points (There are so many that I will have to leave off a few for the sake of brevity) :<br /><br />1. The writing style here is excellent. There are no wasted words and long digressions, and the whole book can be read over the course of an afternoon or two. The clear and cogent arguments seemed to leap off the pages.<br /><br />2. The discussion of Jewish clothing merchants finally included a very subtle point that most people have not appreciated. If you have someone who starts off as a merchant, it is much easier for them to make the transition to professional than it is if you are starting off as a factory worker. It seems that the preponderance of Jews in law is some accident of history (since other groups with a comparable IQs didn't end up so heavily represented in law).<br /><br />3. His chapter on Asian math ability was also something very good. I do know that his observations on the monosyllabic Chinese language were correct. It just never occurred to me that the brevity of the language was a major factor in explaining why the average Asian is better at math than most. His observation on the math skills being dependent on the TYPE of agriculture cultivated was very subtle and plausible.<br /><br />4. One can imagine a plane crash happening because of miscommunication between pilots happening in exactly the way that he described it. Verbal subterfuge is a very common theme in talking with people in Asia. This topic alone could have taken up another two chapters, but Gladwell gave us a just-sufficient dose and then left it to us to read some of the bibliographical materials.<br /><br />5. There has always been a question as to whether IQ is a something that has a threshhold value (i.e., if you fall below a certain point is there something that you just can NEVER do) or is it something that has a linear response (i.e., if you have an IQ of a lower level that it will just take you more time to do the same thing that it would take a higher IQ person to do?). He exposed us to how IQ behaves across the whole spectrum.<br /><br />6. The author was as nice as he could possibly be when he demonstrated the existence of the high IQ fool (i.e., Chris Langan). He quoted some of the nonsense that this man said but was nice enough to leave it to the reader to fill in the blanks.<br /><br />7. Gladwell managed to return to the theme of physical environment (weather/ mountains/ farming conditions) as an explanation of many things many times. The observations were given at various points throughout the text (and not as one never-ending topic) and this made it much more interesting.<br /><br />8. Many social sciences don't go about the business of explaining things that ACTUALLY EXIST. This is one book that bucks that trend and does it with great deftness.to how IQ behaves across the whole spectrum.    6.

B000AM6OQ2|5.0|THE FOG is an awesome horror flick that was released in the Winter of 1980 that scared me when I saw it for the first time on HBO back in March of 1981 when I was only 8 years old practically making me afraid of the fog in general, since you cant see through the fog very well in real-life, except in John Carpenter's masterpiece of THE FOG was kind of like an upgrade of Carpenters 1978 flick HALLOWEEN, since the Michael Myers character seemed to have inspired Carpenter to make this movie THE FOG.<br /><br />Additionally; THE FOG brings with it the souls of the dammed. Fog is nothing new to the quaint seaside village of Antonio Bay, but on the night of its 100th anniversary, a fogbank rolls in unlike any other. Eerie lights, dark figures, and the masts of an ancient schooner appear in the swirling mists, and soon the specters of long-murdered sailors descend upon the town.<br /><br />Using knife, hook and sword, they exact revenge for sins committed by the town's founding fathers, leaving horrified survivors struggling to solve a hundred-year crime. And they must solve it - or die. Starring Adrienne Barbeau, Jamie Lee Curtis, John Houseman, Janet Leigh and Hal Holbrook.<br /><br />John Carpenter's THE FOG is classic horror at its terrifying best and I've noticed that THE FOG had many co-stars from other John Carpenter flicks like<br />*Jamie-Lee Curtis(Elizabeth Solly) who is known for her role as the hapless victim(Laurie Strode)in HALLOWEEN who also gets to co-star with her real-life mother(Janet Leigh)known for her role as Marion Crane in Alfred Hitchcock's PSYCHO<br /><br />*Tom Atkins(Nick Castle)known for his role as Rehme in the 1981 action packed drama John Carpenter's ESCAPE FROM NEW YORK & as Jim Rockford's skeptical nemesis(Lt. Diehl)on THE ROCKFORD FILES<br /><br />*Nancy Loomis(Sandy Fadel) known as Laurie's snotty girlfriend(Annie Brackett)in HALLOWEEN<br /><br />*Adrianne Barbeau(Stevie Wayne) known for her role as Brain's girlfriend(Maggie) in ESCAPE FROM NEW YORK<br /><br />*Charles Cyphers(Dan)known for his role as the concerned, but overwhelmed(Sheriff Lee Brackett)in HALLOWEEN & as the skeptical Secretary of the State in ESCAPE FROM NEW YORK.<br /><br />Therefore, it seemed like John Carpenter's THE FOG had just about every co-star that was in HALLOWEEN, except for Donald Pleasance and PJ Soles.<br /><br />I also think HALLOWEEN & THE FOG were probably Carpenters best flicks of all time, especially Carpenters best horror flicks along with the fact that THE FOG had a lot of interesting special effects like the glowing fog and the make-up used on the dead pirate ghosts, etc., plus I liked the eerie creepy heart-pumping music scoring that John Carpenter did in this movie, just like the music composing he did in HALLOWEEN, THE THING, & ESCAPE FROM N.Y.<br /><br />What I can't help finding kind of odd was THE FOG was actually about a bunch of dead pirate ghosts hidden in the fog setting their sites on a small remote town near Antonio Bay killing people to retrieve their lost cross from a church, which was supposedly the only thing that could get rid of the ghosts who were fogging up the town turning this community upside down, but I was baffled at the end of this movie when the ghosts who were THE FOG returned to the church later on to kill Father Malone(Hal Holbrook) leaving us a cliffhanger making us wonder if those dead pirate ghosts were going to continue or return later to murder more people to get what they wanted.<br /><br />As a matter of fact, the cliffhanger at the end of THE FOG was a tad similar to the cliffhangers end of the movie HALLOWEEN, since Carpenter used the same kind of strategy by keeping us wondering what else Michael Myers was going to do next in HALLOWEEN, since Michael obviously didn't die at the end of HALLOWEEN even though Michael fell off the balcony after being shot 6 times by his psychatrist Dr. Loomis(Donald Pleasance).<br /><br />In addition, I would have to say that THE FOG and HALLOWEEN are my 2 favorite John Carpenter films.<br /><br />This movie also takes me all the way back to memory lane to the days when I was living in hometown(El Centro, CA) where I was raised at since I was 7 years old and living in the Imperial Valley at the time when THE FOG was released in the theaters back in February of 1980.ALLOWEEN are my 2 favorite John Carpenter films.<br /><br />This movie also takes me all the way back to memory lane to the days when I was living in hometown(El Centro, CA) where I was raised at since I was 7 years old and living in the Imperial Valley at the time when THE FOG was released in the theaters back in February of 1980.
B00005JPO1|4.0|I was 11 years old when \\"Raiders\\" came out, so I grew up with Indy.  With the release of \\"Skull\\" I'm now 38.  So I'm starting to understand the plot line in this one that referred sometimes to getting older, a little wiser, and how the world has and is changing around me.  So part of the experience of the movie is sentimental with me, as Indy is like an old friend that you feel you're having a reunion with, comparing notes with about how things are different but also somewhat picking up where you left off.  Lucas was wise to place the story line 2 decades later, just like the real-life timeline.<br />The movie has a good mix of that \\"Saturday Morning Serial\\" adventure that George Lucas had in mind when he invented Indy along with some thoughtful mystery solving.  A little of the action was contrived, mostly with Mutt's action sequences like the sword fight and swinging on the vines with the little monkeys, but all in all it was fine.  The story line struck me as not quite as dark as Indy adventures sometimes got.  Lucas and Speilberg have admitted in the past as mellowing with age and with raising families, and the story kind of reflects this.  I think that if they had to do \\"Temple of Doom\\" today, it'd be written a lot \\"kinder and gentler\\".  Remember the controversy of the release of \\"ET\\" with the federal agents with walkie-talkies in their hands instead of firearms?<br />  Harrison Ford was in no danger of being stood up by anyone.  In fact the way he first appeared in the movie was almost worth the price of the DVD alone, especially for long-time Indy fans.  It made me say, \\"He's back!\\"<br />Get this 2-disc edition.  For only 2 or 3 dollars more you are getting excellent supplemental goodies that you'd expect from a well-crafted DVD.<br />Get it.
B001DDBCUU|5.0|The movie was great -- I expected that.  But I always continue to be impressed by the level of service offered by Amazon.com.

B0016Q2D5M|1.0|I admit I bought (pre-ordered, even!) the DVD mostly in order to check the 3D-gimmick rather than the movie itself. I am sorry to say that, despite the low price, it is a huge disappointment: the 3D version of the film is essentially monochromatic and the 3D illusion is dismal, as there is a double image (ghost). The result is much worse than even an experimental 3D-TV series of broadcasts some years ago...     I fully agree with the reviewer who proposed that a higher-priced but better-realised package would have been much preferable; maybe even a CRT-screen implementation for those (like me) who still prefer a good CRT over a run-of-the-mill LCD screen.     Do not buy this item. Maybe that will give the producers the message that they must do a better job next time.
B001DTPZNY|1.0|Normally, you have to understand the Spielberg \\"action\\" sequences as taking physics and ignoring it but this show was just too much. Having faced the AK-47 in Iraq and read about Spetsnaz I can honestly say that four Spetsnaz with AK-47s firing from less than 20 meters would have killed all in the open car. Period. It went downhill from that point. Tracking devices the size of a lighter. Bad guys teleporting to the next location. Although they got cars from the 1950's I was shocked they didn't have the stars using SAT phones!<br /><br />Since this was from the left wing \\"Heil\\"lywood they had to bring in HUAC and  the \\"black list\\". UPDATE: 11 JUL 1995 US released a cache of Soviet cables that has been decoded during the Cold War called the Verona Project. Senator McCarthy was right! Alger Hiss WAS a Communist Agent. Hollywood WAS being used but Soviet agents!<br /><br />Like all good students of Dr. Goebbels, Hollywood will keep perpetuating the lie. \\"If you tell a lie enough times and with enough passion the people (sheeple) will believe it.\\" Dr. Paul Joseph Goebbels, 1939.

B000059Z8J|4.0|great, enjoyable movie. beautiful soundtrack. just wish r. donner had done more with the man of steel just like g. reeves. foiling a bank robbery, bending steel bars, jumping out of a window, fight scenes with the bad guys. the scene when the bullets bounced off superman in the tunnel should have been left in the theatrical version. it's the 30th anniversary of the 1978 movie. i'm sure WB will re-release an expanded edition with all the deleted scenes that were never shown. i have VHS copies of the TV version off from ABC TV from 1980. lots of nice scenes to see.  enjoy.****
1416562605|1.0|Looks like the Booker Committee is only too pleased to award authors for portraying the negative side of india. I am ashamed to say that Indians will degrade their country only to win the booker prize!     Adiga has been very immature in his comments about the muslims...  \\" And yet all the Muslims you meet are illiterate or covered head to toe in black burkas or looking for buildings to blow up?\\"  \\"They are not the brightest lot\\"    Is it not quite obvious that Adiga is trying to suck up to the westerners by referring to the burkas and blowing up buildings????   I guess he does not know how many literate muslims are in India and how successful they are... the former president of India was a muslim!!!    Well Mr Adiga, wake up and smell the salts!!! Muslims are by far one of the most successful business community in India and in order to be successful one needs to be bright unless of course they suck up to the westerners.    Where does Adiga get off making comments on burkas... well, its a personal preference and one needs to respect it.... Comments like these are a sheer reflection of bias and immaturity!!
B001ACH4DS|5.0|I just listened to it for the first time, and I loved the entire CD.  There's usually at least one \\"throw-in\\" for filler, but I thought the whole thing was just great.  There were no surprises: it sounded just like he did on Idol.  Fans that eagerly anticipated each week on Idol will truly enjoy this CD.  If \\"Permanent\\" is about his brother, it's a heartbreaking comment on the pain that a cancer patient's loved ones feel.  I feel that my money was well spent.
1567184855|5.0|At a bookstore, I casually picked this book off the shelf and looked it over. The premise fascinated me, so I bought it and began reading it. I nearly read it all in one sitting and quickly ordered the sequel, Destiny of Souls. When I began reading this book, I immediately recognized its truth;  on a spiritual level, I could feel it. Its hard to explain. I am generally a cynic by nature, but this book answered the questions of my soul, so to speak. I'm not doing a very good job of explaining this, really.... For me, it is a work that goes far beyond the spoken word. It has become my favorite book of all time, and it is required reading for anyone who is ready to think beyond what conventional religion teaches about the soul.
0061474347|4.0|Though this book wasn't as action packed and enthralling as I'd hoped, I still love it. I'm disappointed with the fact that it really was a couple hundred pages just to set up for the final installment, but I can't help but love it in spite of myself. I'll probably read it again in a few years :)
B001ACH4DS|5.0|I must be honest that I might not be able to express myself as well as Lance, from the Midwest did. That review was beautifully written, and speaks for many of us, so thank you.     Cook, for lack of a better word..conquered me when I first saw him on Idol. His fierce intensity, infectious smile, warm spirit, and ferocious voice knocked me right off my feet. It was quite honestly, instant devastation.    I went right into investigation mode trying to find everything that this man had ever done. Finding Analog Heart, the amazing albums created with Axium, along with other songs not found on these albums..I became completed addicted to this man. (Also MWK, although, the solo endeavor and the work with Axium spoke to me much more)    I was amazed how this man and his enrapturing voice could both excite and move me. From heart pounding rock songs, to soft soulful ballads, it was as if there was a song for every mood.    David has delivered this feeling yet again. This album is amazing.   \\"Bar-Ba-Sol\\" takes me back to the feeling that I got when I heard \\"Thought You Knew\\", the live version from \\"Alive in Tulsa\\". A pulse racing, blood boiling effort that literally had me rolling down the windows of my car blaring it at maximum volume.    Then to \\"Mr. Sensitive\\" and \\"Lie\\", which had me quietly savoring each word. Each song had something that grabbed me in some way.    David does show his heart in this effort. Often in his lyrics, in several songs over the years he has spoken about wearing his \\"heart on his sleeve\\". We see his heart on his album as well. Powerful ballads that speak to us all, it's as if he has a song for every human emotion. Whether he is writing, co-writing, or singing someone else's words, in the end, it is HIS voice that will have to deliver the song.     I love this album. Some may say that the album is uneven, that some songs may not fit..I disagree. There is a song for every emotion. As people we have ups, downs, times when we feel strong, and when wefeel weak. This album covers it all. It dips us into a full sink of emotion, and wrings us out at the same time.    I found myself in tears listening to \\"Permanent\\". While it's been 2 years since I lost my Mother to Cancer, it feels like yesterday. Being closer to her than anyone else in my life, and being the one who cared for her during the last few months, the pain is not felt just with the person who has the disease within their body. It is a fight shared by all those who love that person. And even if you are not in the room at one moment, your loved one should never feel alone..for you are always there with them. This song, without any childish exaggeration, is one of the most beautiful things I have ever heard. Perfectly crafted, piano, strings, and a passionate voice.     I find myself emotionally, and physically exhausted after listening to this album. I laughed, singing catchy lyrics, I closed my eyes, savoring, and quietly wept while listening.     This is only the beginning. We have only been given a taste of what David Cook is capable of. Rockstar..goofball..poet. Thank you for bringing music back to life for this chick. I can't wait to see what you do next.
B000W292FA|4.0|I'm revisiting this record after 15 years and it's fantastic. I just picked up 2004's reunion album (also fantastic) and decided to review some of the older material. Of course the first two TFF records are classics that everybody knows, but all the TFF records are excellent. I saw them in '93.  Jellyfish opened the show and I can't say which goup was better, they were both phenomenal. It was Roland's TFF and they did most of this album along with the hits and it became obvious to me that Roland is the driving force of TFF, no offense to Curt. Roland is a great guitarist too. I can only hope they'll put out more recordings in the future. They are masters of the studio too, in keeping with artists like XTC, Beatles, Peter Gabriel, the Jellyfish guys, etc. All these artists are a big influence on my own music too.
B0008ENICU|5.0|If you need a good laugh and a good cry this is one of those movie classics to enjoy. It's a heart warming film that will leave you inspired to grow your nails jungle red!
B000MCH5P4|5.0|These guys make astounding films. It is amazing how everything links and is not forced at all. It is too bad that the writer and director had a falling out after this film came out. Hopefully they resolve their differences because they mae such incredible films. It shows that great films can be made in Hollywood.
B001KR9AP8|5.0|Loves it.  Fav Songs are Halo, Ave Marie, Broken-Hearted Girl, Radio, Diva, Disappear, and the list goes on.
0061474355|5.0|This book changed my view of science fiction/fantasy books forever - an instant favorite for me! I can't analyze it as critically as I'd like, but I enjoyed it, and I'll always make sure its on my bookshelf!
B001ED7C58|5.0|I really didn't put any expectations into this cd. I just bought it because of the film. Perhaps that helped, but I was pleasantly surprised with this compilation. I LOVE this cd, with the exception of the lullaby. IMO the song itself is fine but it should have a different title. Paramore's becoming a fast fave & Rob's song? Omg, I love it & can't wait for him to cut an album. Anyways, I'm a happy custy!
0763617105|4.0|I picked this book up at our local library on impulse.  I didn't think it'd be a huge hit with my youngest (2 years old), but thought my early readers might enjoy it.  Turns out I was half right.  My 2, 4 and 7 year olds all love this book!  My 10 year old volunteers to read it to them daily.  After having a library copy for only a few days I realized this one needed to be added to our personal collection.  The illustrations are beautiful, the repetition is great and the moral of the story is lovely.
B001F0VHEM|5.0|OK ... so it seems Alecia Beth had a brief, failed marriage, and it left her feeling all grown up ... sort of. And she felt sad and lonely. Well, sometimes. And she had regrets ... but mostly not. And she realized it must have been partly her fault ... but mostly not and besides, he shoulda made allowances because she's - you know: P!nk.    So it seems she set aside the martinis and tequila shooters and took up sipping good wine and (this is key) she seems to have put a big, whoppin' playlist of Joni Mitchell songs on her mp3 player ... and settled down to write some songs.    The result: a complete failure as a sensitive, meaning-laden, \\"I'm a mature woman with lots of deep feelings and thoughtful reflections now\\" CD ...     BUT - it's also another really fine, fluffy dancing/hanging out/sing-along-and-pump-your-fist-while-you-rock-your-booty album from an IRRESISTIBLE and very talented, unreconstructed pop star.    It seems that every time she tries to change, she stays the same, and that's part of the beauty of what she's done with her past albums and now again with this one. She manages to try new things while remaining what she is at her core - one of the most effective, compelling and gifted dance/pop artists out there.    Can't wait to hear what comes next.    This \\"failed\\" album is, in my opinion, another huge, delicious success. I hope she \\"gets better\\" - but what does that really mean?
B001BPJJ9G|5.0|I absolutely love this movie! The story is really unique and the visuals are stunning.
B001FSDOZO|4.0|Knowing Nickelback,you have to expect well written and produced songs .You have it here...Chad Kroeger continues to amaze with his excellent writing.You have the rockers and ballads,but on this album,it stresses more on the rockers.If you have enjoyed the previous albums from Nickelback,there is no reason to stop here.Go get it now and you will be rocked!!! The album is strong from beginning to end.My standout faves are...Something In Your Mouth,Burn It To The Ground,Gotta Be Somebody,Next Go Round,Never Gonna Be Alone,Shakin' Hands,S.E.X. & If Today Was Your Last Day.I pretty much named all the songs as standouts.That just tells you how amazing it is...Go check it out.Rock on!!!!
045122499X|5.0|There is nothing I like more then finding a book I can really sink my teeth into. I love it when a book is so good I find myself thinking about it when I'm not reading it. I love when a book is an easy read not because the content is frivalous, but the writing is fluid and well paced. I love books that have epic story lines and diverse characters. I love historical fiction that is well researched but not \\"preachy\\". As a relatively slow reader, I love being able to read 100+ pages in one go without batting an eye. I love this book because it provides all these things.<br />If you're looking for a book with emotional depth and contemplative prose, move along.<br />If you're looking to invest yourself in a long and thrilling tale, look no further.<br />Rating: 5 out of 5 Stars<br />Suggested With: An oversized chair and a tankard of ale. ;)
159102594X|5.0|While I admit that the characters are entertaining, the pace lively, and the style impressive; this books greatest achievement is its sheer savagery. For the scenes of Glotka torturing, the northmen rampaging, and best of all Logen's battle sequence, this book is worth your $15. This is the sort of book that makes you want to beat your chest with fury when you turn the final pages. The only fight sequence that compares in my opinion is The Mountain vs The Viper from Storm of Swords. Good Job Joe!
B001ACH4DS|5.0|Didn't think this album would or could beat Analog Heart..But to my surprise I think this album of David Cooks' is indeed better if that is possible. The lyrics are meaningful and inspiring; the melodies moving and the entire package is just unbelievble - not the standard cookie cutter one would expect from an AI WINNER. I also purchased from ITunes to get the bonus track 'My Last Request' & was totally blown away by that song.  The entire album is great - no throw away songs on this one - it rocks plus some amazing ballads - Also the bonus track from Walmart 'Breath Tonight' is awesome.  GREAT JOB DAVID !! LLLOVE IT !!!
0739368044|5.0|This is a great book. It was as good if not better than Eldest. I personally thought Eragon was a great book, however it had parts in it that were a bit boring to me causing me to lose interest. but Eldest was great all the way from start to finish. Just like this one, It is a ride from start to finish.    I just hate to have to wait for the final chapter. I cant wait to read it! Hopefully it will come out soon!
1568987846|5.0|Love this book!!! Have been visiting their blog for more then one year. Always love their photos and life style. Finally it's in print! Love it love it love it!

0316017922|4.0|Once again Gladwell gets beneath the hood of life and finds out how the engine runs. In Outliers he takes on diverse subjects, looking at them in ways that haven't been elucidated before (except by a few). He is a collector of these stories, not the original investigator, but he is more interesting for that reason. He synthesizes the knowledge, assembling disparate accounts into a coherent and surprising truth. He is also a wonderful story-teller. He makes the stories interesting and easy to read. I inhaled this entire book in one day.<br /><br />In this volume I learned about the importance of your birthdate in sports and academic achievement, the need for 10,000 hours practice, and the advantages of emotional intelligence. Gladwell concludes that without certain advantages, few people excel. This is not a welcome conclusion, but it is an important one.<br /><br />Each of these stories can stand alone, as a fascinating vignette, an instructive lesson. The implications for our world are many. An intelligent motivated individual could read this book and take any number of these ideas make it into a great opportunity to improve the world and themselves. Even more importantly, you can take the book as a whole and adopt a new way of looking at the world. This is not a how-to manual, or a self help book. Some have criticized his work because it does not give you a blueprint for success. Those criticisms miss the point. This knowledge is powerful all by itself.<br /><br />I once had the good fortune to hear Gladwell speak. He did not cut an impressive figure, reminding me more of Sideshow Bob than Albert Einstein. When he began to speak, however, he wiped away all of my skepticism. Malcolm Gladwell is a genuine phenomenon. Read his book!
B001H5X7I4|1.0|I like Ben but it has way too much foul language and Tom Cruise looks horrible and his Character is not likeable. If you think cussing and putting down others with foul language funny then you will like this. This movie is not for children.
B001GAPC1K|1.0|When you pay for shipping at Amazon what you are really doing is paying them not to delay your order.

B001ECE6D0|4.0|Stereophonics have been churning out albums (and singles) pretty much like clockwork since their 1997 debut album: every 2 years fans get a new album, and after 6 studio albums (and one live album), the band finally gets the greatest hits treatment.<br /><br />\\"Decade In the Sun: Best of Stereophonics\\" (20 tracks; 79 min.) brings the greatest hits of the band, and rightfully, this compilation focuses on the first 3 studio albums. The very promising 1997 debut \\"Word Gets Around\\" has 4 tracks on here (Local Boy in a Photograph; Thousand Trees; Traffic; More Life in a Tramps Vest). The band's best album ever, 1999's \\"Performance & Cocktails\\" also gets 4 tracks (Bartender and the Thief; Just Looking; Pick a Part that's New; I Wouldn't Believe Your Radio). And 2001's \\"Just Enough Education to Perform\\" also gets 4 tracks (Have a Nice Day; Mr. Writer; Step On My Old Size Nines; Vegas Two Times), plus this includes the non-album single from the same sessions, the Rod Stewart-cover \\"Handbags and Gladrags\\". The rest of is filled out by singles from the last 3 albums, with the 2005 \\"Language\\" album getting 3 tracks (including \\"Dakota\\", the band's biggest UK charting single ever). 2003's \\"You Gotta Go There To Come Back\\" is represented by \\"Maybe Tomorrow\\", and 2007's \\"Pull the Pin\\" features \\"It Means Nothing\\". There are also 2 new tracks, the so-so \\"My Own Worst Enemy\\" and the much better \\"You're My Star\\".<br /><br />In all, this is a very generous serving of Stereophonics' greatest hits (and they've had plenty of hits in the UK). I don't like the sequencing of the tracks, to be honest. There is no rhyme or reason to it. A chronological sequencing would have served the listening experience better. While the band's output after \\"J.E.E.P.\\" never equalled their first three albums, they did put out a lot of great music in the late 90s/early 2000s, and this compilation is proof of it. I had the good fortune of seeing the band live a couple of times on the \\"J.E.E.P.\\" tour, and they were outstanding in those days.ing in those days.
B001KO3FFW|5.0|David Cook is more than a contest winner, he is a bonafide rockstar!  This cd doesn't have a weak track, they're all dynamic.  I can't listen to it enough.  Standouts include: Declaration, Permanent, Come Back to Me, Lie and Bar-Ba-Sol(but they're all very enjoyable).  Cook wrote or cowrote nearly every track and shows himself to be a talented songwriter.  He will be a star for years and years!
0979433703|3.0|\\"This book is really short.  Short books are hard to write, but you made me do it.  My readers are excellent correspondents, and this is something I've learned from them along the way:  Write less.\\"  --Seth Godin<br /><br />Damn straight.  This book is an exercise in brevity.  I often recommend that readers preview a key chapter before deciding whether to commit to a book.  No need with this one--just take an extra 20 minutes and read the whole thing.  Borrow it instead of buying it; the key points will stick with you.<br /><br />Godin's points are straightforward:<br /><br />* Comes a time in doing anything when it gets hard and stops being fun.<br />* If it is something you can be the best at, stick with it through the \\"dip.\\"<br />* If it isn't something you can excel at, quit.  And excel at something else.<br />* Learn to recognize such \\"cul-de-sacs\\" and avoid even starting such paths.<br />* Endlessly coping without either excelling or quitting is a trap.<br />* Systems are designed to exploit \\"copers\\" in various ways.  Beware.<br />* There are eight common causes of \\"dips.\\"  Beware some more.<br /><br />That's pretty much it.  There are some good stories about Vince Lumbardi, Butch Cassidy, the space shuttle, and Microsoft.  But they build on the main points.  There is good advice here.  It would be worth your time, even if it were longer.

B000U7SN8O|5.0|A lot of people hate Bob Dylan's voice too, but in so doing, they miss one of the greatest artists of the rock era.  Am I comparing Mangum to Dylan?  Hell yes I am.<br /><br />For those who don't get it, just move on to something more accessible to you.  But for those who understand, this is one of the best albums of all time, hands down.
B000FILW86|3.0|Pleasantly surprised by the cd. Don`t always know what to expect from Cheap Trick.I personally would not have led the cd off with \\"welcome to my world\\". Didn`t really care for that song. The song \\"One more\\" would have been a good start to kick off the cd. Overall the cd has some good up beat songs like \\"Give it away \\" - \\"If it takes a lifetime\\" - \\"Perfect stranger\\" - \\"Every night and every day\\" and the song \\" Come on come come\\" which I really liked. Overall - the cd was pretty good and worth a listen. Cheap Trick fans will like this cd and probably others who haven`t heard Cheap Trick.
1433502410|5.0|Let me first say that I am a layman who uses study Bibles to help me in personal study and in carrying out Bible teaching responsibilities.  I have been using the English Standard Version Study Bible (ESVSB) for a little over two weeks now and it is already an invaluable tool.  My frame of reference is the Life Application Bible which I had been using for more than ten years.  Now there is nothing wrong with the Life Application Bible.  It is still an excellent study tool, particularly the introductions to the books of the Bible.  But the ESVSB simply contains so much more valuable material.  Let me illustrate.  The introduction to the book of Isaiah in the Life Application Bible runs to two pages, discussing themes, an outline and a timeline, authorships and dates.  The same material in the ESVSB runs to seven pages, drilling down into much more detail.  The same thing is true for the book of Romans in the New Testament, where the Life Application Bible provides two pages of introduction and the ESVSB provides six pages.<br /><br />There are basically three things one can get from a good study Bible.<br />1) Notes on the Bible passages.<br />2) Introductions and supplemental material about each book.<br />3) Introductions and supplemental material about the Bible as a whole and its themes.<br /><br />In all three areas, the ESVSB seems to excel from my short exposure to it.  I have already commented on the introductions to the books.<br /><br />I am currently leading a study of the book of Daniel and was in the middle of the complicated last three chapters, 10 - 12 when I received this study Bible.  It was immediately a great aid to me, both in terms of explaining the various interpretations of Daniel 11 and providing voluminous supplemental material.  Daniel 10 - 12 is of great interest because of its prophetic words about the future and end times.  It is foundational in studying prophetic future and in the study of eschatology.  The notes on the chapter explain rather fully not only the dispensational view, for whom this chapter has great significance, but they explore alternate perspectives as well.  Particularly good are the notes about the near term inter-testamental period in which this material was first fulfilled.  There is a well researched and documented exposition of the Persian, Greek, and Hasmonian empires complete with lists of rulers that help to explain the cryptic comments about the various Kings of the North and South in Daniel 11.<br /><br />As far as the summary sections and comments, I have already used the articles on the background of the New Testament and the intertestamental period and have found them extremely helpful.<br /><br />Many study Bibles seem to have a specific perspective and theological point of view.  The one perhaps most similar to the ESV Study Bible is the ESV Reformation Study Bible edited by R. C. Sproul.  In fact, many of the contributors to the ESV Reformation Study Bible also contributed to the ESV Study Bible.  The major difference seems to be (and I have not personally seen the ESV Reformation Study Bible) the desire to emphasize Reformed tradition particularly, possibly at the expense of other points of view.  Other study Bibles offer the views of a single author, such as the MacArthur Study Bible or the Ryrie Study Bible, both espousing a dispensational perspective with varying degrees of intensity.  The ESVSB seems to offer a strong evangelical perspective with a Reformed position mixed with full explanations of dispensational theology.<br /><br />The ESVSB major editorial tasks were carried out by Wayne Grudem and J. I. Packer, two well known names in the world of evangelical scholarship.  They also contributed study notes or articles for some of the specific books of the Bible.  Other article contributors were well known evangelical writers, John Piper, Mark Dever and R. Kent Hughes.  There are extensive articles on a wide range of subjects from the Intertestemental Periodto God's Plan of Salvation.  There is an interesting series of articles relating the Bible to Judiasm, Islam, other world religions and cults.<br /><br />All in all, the ESV Study Bible gives you perhaps more than you wanted to know and much that is useful for anyone seeking to more fully and accurately understand what the Bible is saying and how it relates to our worldview.  I could not recommend it more highly.ries of articles relating the Bible to Judiasm, Islam, other world religions and cults.

B001FB4W0W|5.0|Rabbit ears on pawn shop televisions are about my speed; needless to say, I don't watch television.  However, kind friends mainline this series two or three shows at a time, and they got me hooked: were I to be completely honest, I might have to admit to giving serious thought to obtaining this by less-than-legal-means.  It actually might be worth jail time.<br /><br />Speaking as someone who was born in America's deep South, this series captures everything about Louisiana that is appealing.  (Spanish Moss, vampires, latent racism and homophobia, the dichotomy between Christian Southern values and patriarchal, brutality-enforced poverty, sassy Southern women who know how to fight with chains, etc.)<br /><br />What it makes it really stand out, though, is the casting:  there isn't a bad actor in the bunch--and they are all believable as Southern archetypes.  Nelsan Ellis as the short order cook/drug dealer Lafayette and Stephen Moyer and Anna Paquin as the romantic leads give mesmerizing performances.<br /><br />True Blood, or possibly the original series of books from which it arose, is an arresting set of stories:  Faulkner says that the only thing really worth writing about (or thinking about, by extension) is the human heart in conflict with itself.  The Southern United States depicted in True Blood is conflict embodied--you are a supposed to be a good Christian, and follow the rules of an established society, but you live in the middle of a swamp so dense and wild that it believably could be home to minions of Satan, like vampires.<br /><br />It's a lot to think about.  If you are one of those artistic/professional types with too much to do, don't start watching this;  it becomes an obsession.<br /><br />And Now:  A Short Review of the Actual DVD--this is the regular, not Blu-Ray version, as my $100.00, cigarette-burned, pawn shop t.v. doesn't do Blu-Ray.<br /><br />Price: $10.00 less than my local electronics store.<br /><br />Extras: There is some very funny stuff here that was not on the original websites for the series:  ads for lawyers for vampires; vampire hotels; vampire dating, all done with the appropriate levels of fake bad acting and camp.<br /><br />Don't be afraid to look at the French language ad as well.  It uses all of six French words which you probably already know.<br /><br />There is also a short video parody of someone like Hugh Downs doing an in-depth report on vampires.  Complete with bad video backgrounds for foreign locales and hokey vampire internet conspiracies, this is a well-done, satirical background take on some of the 'vampire movement's more glossed-over history.<br /><br />One negative:  the commentary tracks play over the original episodes; it's neat to watch for about five minutes, and then it's a little bit like dissecting a romantic relationship--the mystery dies once the magic involved gets out into the bright light of day.<br /><br />However, overall, True Blood Season One is well worth watching again--particularly in the pilot episode, the acting, and the effort the cast and crew put into characterization and detail, is even more obvious the second time around.e series:  ads for lawyers for vampires; vampire hotels; vampire dating, all done with the appropriate levels of fake bad acting and camp.

B001FSDOZO|4.0|I am a huge Nickelback fan and have all of their cds.  This one was good, definately not as good as All the Right Reasons though, which was almost good all the way through.  Dark Horse has some good solid hits on it and should do well.  What I don't like is that there are either slower ballod songs, and then there are songs about sex and drugs, no middle ground.  I like both the edgier side of Nickelback and the softer side, I could do without all the sex and drugs though.

B0013FXWU6|4.0|Fascinating film exploring the great American themes of religion, family, and capitalism. Director Poul Thomas Anderson creates a parallel universe all his own (ostensibly the early 20th century) through daring use of lighting, music, and silence. Daniel Day Lewis's performance as the uncomprising oilman is superb. A few lulls and an abrupt ending are the only thing that detract from this one. Admittedly not to all tastes.
B001EOQWEO|1.0|I saw this movie in the theatre and LOVED it!  I thought it was brilliant.  I couldn't wait for it to come out on dvd.      The day of its release I went to Wal-Mart and purchased the special edition as I really wanted the digital copy for my iPod and computer.  I get home, insert the digital copy into my computer, only to realize there is no authorization code.  I take it back to wal-mart and exchange it.  The lady opens it there and again, no code.  She explains that 10 other people have been in complaining about no codes and how none of the copies seem to have them.  She says I should call disney as they can't be opening every dvd.      I get home and get on the phone with Disney \\"customer support\\".  What it boils down to is they admitted it was their fault.  The girl offers me a sincere apology.  So I figure, great the problem will be rectified.  Nope.  Instead what I am sent via email is a process where by I, the paying customer, must now jump through hoops to get a copy of this code.  I have to print out a form, fill it out, go make copies of my receipt and my proof of purchase and then either scan it, fax it or mail them the forms.  After Disney receives it, they will mail me a code and I should get it in the mail (7-10 business days later).  O_o      Now, while it may not seem to be too much hassle to scan and copy and print; there is no reason why I should have to do ANYTHING after I spent my money and Disney clearly admitted fault.  Forgive me if I missed the whole concept of customer service, but shouldn't it be Disney who should be jumping through hoops to rectify the wrong?  I paid extra money to have the product when I purchased it; not to take have to do some legging around and then wait almost 2 weeks later.      My advice; if you really want the digital copy buy the regular version for $15 and then hop on iTunes and download Wall-E there.  You'll spend about the same amount of money and you'll save yourself a whole lot of time and aggravation.I hate to give this product a low score as I think this is one of the best movies of all time with a terrific story and great message.  But Disney screwed up big time with their customer service on this one.  Way to not provide for your customers and then treat them like pirating criminals when they want what they should have had at purchase.  It's perplexing.  How can people successfully run a business this way?
0804106304|4.0|The Joy Luck Club / 0-8041-0630-4<br /><br />\\"The Joy Luck Club\\" is in my opinion the best of Tan's works. While each of her stories deal with the generational gap between mothers and daughters (compounded with a culture gap and a language gap, as well!), and while each of her novels delve into cultural violence against women, \\"The Joy Luck Club\\" examines these issues most openly, most honestly, and most diversely of all her works.<br /><br />The range of emotions here is wide and realistic - mothers and daughters are afflicted by a realistic mixture of love and hate, pride and disappointment, admiration and resentment. They want to be a part of this other person, but at the same time, they wish to define themselves as something definitively other and different. They push away even as they long to embrace. This is realism, this is being a mother and being a daughter. They are wise and foolish at the same time.<br /><br />Much has been written about Tan and the male characters in her writing and I cannot add much here. While I will agree that Tan can go over the top and become excessive in her 'sexually violent villain' tropes, there are certainly men who can and will treat the women in their lives abhorrently. In my opinion, the worst you can say about Tan and her views on men is not that she has so many male villains, but that the \\"good\\" men she provides as counter-points seem to be frequently emotionally distant and more passive-aggressive than an actual, healthy human being. I do not believe that Tan is capable of extending the same warmth and understanding to her male characters as she extends to her female characters and this, more than the formulaic nature of her other works, seems to be the biggest flaw in this otherwise fantastic novel.<br /><br />~ Ana Mardoll
B00008OE4W|5.0|Indeed, this was the early 90's and I was DEEP in the \\"hacker scene.\\" Except for the fact that everyone in the movie is a bit too old, it really has the feel of that sense of power you felt when you hacked into a system, or cracked someone's lame software copy protection. But the NAME of this movie is what limited its distribution. I was invited to see this by a colleague of mine and he only told me the name. Hell, I thought it was gonna be some basketball sports film or something. But I went anyway. Was I surprised! The movie was intelligent and really spoke about how important the \\"electric village\\" would really become. But here comes this little film our of nowhere and just really NAILS it. Yes, some of the film was improbable, and the techno sequences are really showing their age if you've really followed tech like I have. But all that stuff about a bunch of guys probing a chip looking for ways we could mess with it. That was just how it was! And this was in a movie! Anyway, when I want to plug into my rowdier days, I give this one a spin.
B001KQIAXM|5.0|This album is really good.  I don't know much about Beyonce's music after Destiny's Child, but this album shows good lyrical depth, lots of different styles, and unique sounds.  Also, I was able to see one of her music videos and a performance on SNL, and she is bringing new types of dance moves to the scene.  Being a good music artist is about working hard and creating music that is identifiably yours.  She has clearly worked VERY hard on this album, and you don't have to like it to respect that.
B000VWYNOG|4.0|The only reason that I gave this collection four stars is because it doesnt feature my favorite Van track,\\"I'll be your lover too\\". Other than that, if you arent going to buy the individual albums(like me), then this is a great collection that summarizes the bulk of Van's most well loved songs. A prolific and beautiful songwriter, Van has penned timeless classics that have endured the test of time. Buy this album and go for a long drive alone with this album as your companion and you'll understand what I'm trying to say.
1892005034|4.0|In the distant past, when I was training for work as a therapist, Carl Rogers was one of my gurus. Rogers' concept of absolute respect for the client helped me assist persons and couples in reaching their potential. I am delighted to find Marshall Rosenberg's book--a book that lifts Rogers' concepts out of the therapeutic setting and establishes it in the world of common communication. His writing is clear, and his examples are helpful. I recently used this book in a class that was examining ways of establishing islands of non-violence in a violence-saturated society.    I have one complaint. Rosenberg implies that a careful use of nonviolent communication could rid our relationships of anger. Anger can, indeed, be destructive. Anger needs to be channeled, not eliminated, and nonviolent communication can assist in achieving this goal. But eliminating it altogether? Is there a spouse in this universe who wants to be married to someone who never becomes angry?     So I encourage people to read and respond to this fine book. Know, however, that nonviolent communication, while it can deepen and enrich our relationships, will not turn those relationships into a boring flatness.    Andrew J. (Jack) Good, Roanoke, Virginia
015206396X|4.0|This book was fun to read, it doesn't take a long time to read and is very entertaining, I think most people would like it.
0486417751|5.0|This book is a timeless and beloved classic. It's a beautiful story of class in Jane Austen's time that appeals to us today because it is so well-wrtitten.  It's scrupulously clean morally, and I would recommend it to anyone who appreciates the time when love stories were wholesome and pure and touching.  All the characters have an appeal that's makes you appreciate the way they fit into the story.
B00008OWZC|5.0|In my opinion this is the definitive live album from the greatest rock band of all time. I would say this is Zeppelin in their prime, but after seeing footage of their 02 Arena reunion in December '07 it appears that they've never left their prime. Needless to say, this collection is fantastic from beginning to end. From the extended guitar solo on the Immigrant Song to the extended jam on Whole lotta love, this album delivers. If you want Zeppelin baby then you've got it!
1591840562|5.0|The Art of the Start is a great motivator for those who are interested in starting just about anything. Yes, Guy dives into a lot of topics pertaining to venture capitalism, but if you are starting a small business, this book will still give you to motivation to go out and get things done. This book is like a match lit up under your seat. Read it. You'll enjoy it and be driven by it.
B000HWZ4CA|5.0|Excellent depiction of values,family,God and Country.  A time walk through all phases of life in an honest way.  the bonus footages and the stories told. are well worth the price if the movie was sold seperatly .. love it
B000PC1N54|4.0|Beautiful Aida production by Zefferelli at La Scala Milan. This production is a little over done but beautifully set. The singers are amazing except that I found Alagna's infamous aria \\"Dolce Aida\\" to be sung in an almost forced and yelling voice. So far, I have just watched the Acts 1&2 first DVD, and so far I can tell you that you will be dissapointed by the anoying fading of pictures throught the video. This is done in a manner that you want to scream and say stop doing that!!!Just focus on the characters and lets enjoy the performance in a way that a seating patron there was enjoying it. By, the way the ballet at the end of Act 2 was very sexy and beautifully danced. 4 stars for the singing 5 stars for the ballet and 5 star for the sets and costumes. 0 star for the video direction.
B000QFAJ7S|5.0|This is a very intense CD by Kelly.  She co-wrote all of the songs.  I think the vocal performances are amazing - you truly feel the emotion she's portraying - and that's what makes a true artist.  The last song on the CD is really beautiful - it made me cry - if you want to hear some real artistry, you'll love this CD - it's not one to make you happy - but is one to listen to if you want to know what singing is all about - having the listener feel what the singer is feeling.  Beautiful job, Kelly.  I really hope, though, that you're happier in real life!
B001EN71CW|5.0|Loved everything about this.  I always want more extras but for a show with one short season we probably everything there is.
B000WTNCYA|4.0|Disabled in a traffic accident when she was 19, the story of how music helped her to deal with cognitive and physical impairment is really inspiring.     But aside from that, her voice, that can be tender and yet gravelly when it cracks, seems to be made for this genre. The track \\"All That You Need Is Love\\" is on mega spin on my iPOD!
B001FBSMW6|3.0|Sounds like David bowie \\"lets dance\\" on their best track spiralling, the third song better this sounds again like another Bowie-eque song \\"ashes to ashes\\", very 80's influnce synth-pop album overall, not as strong as the Iron seas album.  For die hard fans get this album.  Did you know that the singer is playing the guitar lead on the first track, and does it well live.
0689853637|5.0|This is another wonderful Sabuda pop up you are sure to enjoy. The book contains six two-page spreads, each with a large and awesome pop up. Five spreads also have a partial-page flap that reveals a second pop up. The last spread, instead of a flap, has a unique surprise.    The story is a bit simple, but it works for me. It is about taking a walk in the quiet winter world and seeing all the activity that is happening under the blanket of snow. It is the only area I can see anyone finding fault, perhaps wanting a more engrossing storyline to interest kids. But I think they will be entertained by the pop ups and talk about their own winter walks.     The book overall is done in outdoor wintry colors, white, blue, and purple with green and brown plant life. The pages and cover also have glittering snow (with texture) and silvery water. The pop ups are mostly white. The pop ups are really fabulous and convey the surprise and awe you might have if you were the one taking the walk and seeing these things.     The pop ups open and close with relative ease. I sometimes feel a deer catching as I carefully close one spread, but it is aligned correctly and requires more force closing it or, on the careful side, a slight poke to the deer.     For families, I see this as a book that gets tucked away in holiday boxes. It can be brought out as a special treat. Young kids will continue to enjoy it when they are older because it is a holiday tradition. This book will also appeal to pop-up collectors.      *SPOILER ALERT* DESCRIPTION OF POP UPS  -Flying snowy owl, mice in a tree  -Foxes in a cave, leaping rabbit  -Bear hunting in stream near waterfall, fish leaping from water  -Deer frolicking, squirrels collection nuts  -Moose (turkey hiding in fallen tree), beavers   -FINALE-Glowing Christmas lights (when you pull the tab) on a little cottage surrounded by trees and most of the animals spied on the walk
B001CDLAT4|5.0|It's a stunning work of art brought to life in its best form yet. I haven't seen the transfer for the dvd version, but I did check out the blu-ray one and it's amazing. If you have the dough, pony up for a blu-ray player and get the blu-ray version of Baraka; you won't be disappointed.<br />The film itself is brilliant. I don't find it as moving as Koyaanisqatsi, but it's powerful nontheless. Stearns' music is great and complements the visuals perfectly. This is a precursor to films like winged migration, the cinematography of planet earth, microcosmos and more.
B000GFLE86|4.0|Peyroux is one jazz chanteuse with mass appeal - her mix of new tunes and familiar covers are seamlessly put together to a cohesive whole.     Her own compositions like 'I'm Alright' fit right into the blend, with singer-songwriter classics like Tom Waits's '(Looking for) the Heart of Saturday Night' and Joni Mitchell's 'River' (on which k.d. lang guests to give some street cred), along with jazz standards like 'Summer Wind' popularised by Frank Sinatra in the 60s.

B001ACH4DS|5.0|High expectations for this release, and David did NOT disappoint!  So much to choose from, twists and turns (just as David promised), somehow neatly packaged into this achingly beautiful, soulful and OMG-HOT rockin' cd! No fillers or skip-overs on this one.... every song is perfect in its own, unique way... and I can't wait to hear these LIVE!!!!!  No need to list the songs, as others have already done this.  My list of 'favorites' grows longer each time I listen, so I won't try to list those either(:  ***BE SURE NOT TO MISS the *hidden* track...  I'm not sure if everyone is hearing that one, and you really won't want to miss this gem!  It comes after A Daily AntheM, but doesn't start until the 12 minute mark of that track. (Since A Daily AntheM ends at around 4:26, there is some silence... don't advance to the next track!!) If the wait is too long, just use your search/ff to forward through to the 12 minute mark, and the treat waiting there is well worth the extra effort!! (Gulp! kissontheneck......fans self with David Cook cd booklet.... thud.)    Okay, I'm back(:     A big thanks to David, not only for pouring his heart and soul into this record, but for allowing us to be a little part of the crazy-amazing journey he's been on.  Quite a ride... and the best is yet to come, I'm certain.  Looking forward to it...
B001B1T7BU|3.0|Modern technology has taken live-action filmmaking to limitless heights, but there are still some stories that are more suited for feature-animation. Dodie Smith's \\"The Hundred and One Dalmatians\\" is one of them. Walt Disney knew this and his \\"One Hundred and One Dalmatians\\" is one of the most loved animated films of all time. Unfortunately, director John Hughes did not and his live-action remake, \\"101 Dalmatians, comes up short in the end.<br /><br />It is not a bad film, but it is incredibly awkward and extremely unfocused at times. Instead of a seamless blend of animal and human characters, we are now forced to get involved almost solely with the two-legged heroes of the picture, which is occasionally sweet, but obviously not right for a film that is supposed to be about dogs. Pongo and Perdita along with their brood of ninety-nine puppies have been pushed to the wayside and the collection of fur and feathered supporting players, which include a menagerie of barnyard creatures, are reduced to slapstick.<br /><br />Cruella DeVil is still the driving force of the plot. Glenn Close gives audiences a marvelously overblown performance full of grandiosity and nuance, but her efforts are still no match for her animated predecessor voiced by Betty Lou Gerson. And Cruella's bumbling cronies, Horace and Jasper (Mark Williams and Hugh Laurie) are merely cockney clones of the burglars from Hughes's \\"Home Alone\\" movies.<br /><br />The only characters that seem right are Roger (Jeff Daniels) and Anita (Joely Richardson). Daniels and Richardson have genuine chemistry and the prescence of Joan Plowright as Nanny only adds to the warmth. The three of them deserve a movie of their own.
B000R7I3LY|4.0|Another plinker-plunker songstress in the AC vein that threatens to fall headlong into MOR territory, especially with her 'Love Song' played to ad nauseum on the airwaves...     Ironically, there's a good chance she may have that hit single working against her eventually, and that she won't be remembered for any of the other great tunes in this album... Now that would be a real pity because her talent is unmistakeable...
0316017922|5.0|Life is not fair. This small, fascinating book proves that it is not really a pick-yourself-up-by-your-bootstraps world. There are unnoticed biases and predetermined traps for the innocent everywhere. The successful have \\"hidden advantages and extraordinary opportunities and cultural legacies\\" that are doled out unfairly.<br /><br />Most of us know this. But Outliers shows us the patterns to this phenomenon, the data behind the unfairness. And author Malcolm Gladwell uses compelling stories to make his case.<br /><br />The prevailing wisdom on success holds that it is an individual activity available to everyone. Someone that excels either works harder or smarter or was born with more natural talent. The secret can't be something as innocuous as your birthday. But for Canadian hockey players, it is. Boys with birthdays closest to the January 1 cutoff date for picking teams are overwhelmingly chosen as the \\"best players,\\" and given tremendous opportunities. This makes them truly better, not just older and more mature than their December-born playmates.<br /><br />In one engrossing story after another, Outliers proves with simple, elegant logic that success occurring through individual merit is a myth. It actually depends on more than the individual. You have to look at the bigger picture, at the forest instead of the trees.<br /><br />It was fun reading about Jeb Bush insisting that he is a self-made man, that he got ahead by his own individual pluck and determination. This from a man born to a United States president, brother to another, and grandson to a senator and wealthy Wall Street banker. Gladwell points out that this is \\"thinking that cannot be described as anything other than delusional.\\"<br /><br />Another interesting book in the same vein: [[ASIN:0375424040 The Drunkard's Walk: How Randomness Rules Our Lives]].<br /><br />I couldn't put Outliers down.

B00005JM4Z|4.0|The level of absurdity and ridiculousness in John Singleton's \\"2 Fast 2 Furious\\" is irrelevant. If I were to launch a scathing attack citing its thin story, one-dimensional characters and lack of dialogue as the reason for my distaste towards it, I would be the dumb one. This is a film that delivers exactly what it promises and I have to admire it for that reason.<br />  Paul Walker is back as Brian O'Connor, the former Los Angeles undercover cop who let Vin Diesel go free at the end of the first installment. (Diesel, who shot to fame after the release of the original film chose not to return to the franchise.) Now in Miami, a dishonored Brian becomes once again embroiled in the world of illegal street racing that is as usual populated with car loads of hot babes, bad guys, and masses of extras on the sidelines. Despite his poor record, O'Conner is confronted by the police who promise to clear his name if he goes undercover as the driver for an evil drug lord named Carter Verone (Cole Hauser) whose main function in the story is to convincingly set up a series of outlandish set pieces and provide the good characters with offers they can't refuse.<br />  While Diesel's character is missed, the screenwriters have supplied Walker with another fiery foil in Roman Pearce, played with great vigor by Tyrese Gibson. Also along for the ride is Monica Fuentes, a sexy customs agent played by Eva Mendes who has been posing as Verone's girlfriend for the past nine months.<br />  But who cares about characters in a movie like this? The action that is the main focus here and Singleton, who is best known for his 1991 drama \\"Boys N the Hood\\", is surprisingly well suited for the genre. His need and love of speed is clear throughout the movie and each action sequence seems to build off the previous one. Instead of focusing on character development and the grit and harshness of the surrounding Miami landscape, he is more concerned with the thrill of the chase, the roars of the engines, and the flashes of painted chrome. The end result is both fast and furious.nes, and the flashes of painted chrome. The end result is both fast and furious.
0060751967|5.0|I loved this book! I was a little worried about getting it because it was supposed to be funny. I don't like books that don't take themselves seriously, but this was not one of those.  Contrary to the book jacket, this book is not centered around a tooth. Sure, that is part of the plot, but there is more to the story than a tooth.  The tooth is just the beginning. I thought the mafia hit on the main character would make the book strange, but it all fit perfectly.  The plot is very believable and the characters are endearing! I'm not sure if I will continue this series, this books seems stand alone to me.  One of the best in the many books I have read recently.  A quick and fun ride, I highly suggest it.

B002S8AGZG|3.0|\\"10 Things I Hate About You\\" was part of an interesting and often-criticized trend in 90's American cinema: Take a popular work of classic literature and place it in a modern teenage world. The high point of the sub-genre was no doubt Amy Heckerling's ultra-hip \\"Clueless\\", based on Jane Austen's classic novel \\"Emma\\". That film had a story that was not afraid to break free of its source material and provided audiences with a memorable new heroine and Alicia Silverstone with a sparkling screen debut. By comparison, \\"10 Things I Hate About You\\" only works some of the time.<br /><br />For all its hip dialogue and contemporary sensibility, it uses plot conventions and cliches so ancient that the very thought of it conjures up images of studio executives passing out scripts made of papyrus scrolls and the story in which it is based, Shakespeare's \\"The Taming of the Shrew\\", is used as a springboard for a series of not-so-subtle winks at the camera. The story lacks inspiration in a lot of other key areas as well. It painfully sticks to the traditional boy meets girl, boy loses girl, boy gets girl formula and for reasons unknown to me, the screenwriters found it necessary to incorporate an assembly line of scenes found in almost ever other run-of-the-mill high school comedy including an obligatory party scene and an emotional climax at the prom.<br /><br />Despite these flaws, the film maintains an air of freshness and undeniable charm thanks to a competent cast and the occasional sprinkling of wit. At Padua High School (wink), Julia Stiles plays Katrina \\"Kat\\" Stratford, a smart but angst-ridden social outcast. When her more popular and gleefully shallow younger sister, Bianca, wants to date a self-absorbed underwear model, their overbearing father states that Bianca can date, but only if Kat does too. Upon hearing this, Cameron James (Joseph Gordon-Levitt), a shy transfer student who secretly idolizes Bianca, bribes the school bad boy, Patrick Verona (Heath Ledger), into courting the tempestuous Kat who is won over by Patrick's wily charm in spite of herself.<br /><br />The scene that is most remembered is in fact the one scene of pure joy and originality. In it we see Ledger's character singing and dancing across the bleachers of the school's football stadium whilst professing his love for Kat and for a moment, it is clear that the film indeed has a heartbeat. The chemistry between Stiles and Ledger is the highlight of the film. Their romance is genuine and effective and at times I wished that their characters could have abandoned the script and started fresh with a new plot.<br /><br />Complimenting their performances is a bright and breezy soundtrack and a few praiseworthy supporting players including the always reliable Allison Janney as a horny high school counselor and Daryl \\"Chill\\" Mitchell as a passionate English teacher who raps the words of Shakespeare to glorious effect. Imagine if the writers had taken a cue from the Mitchell character and turned the project into a Shakespeare-inspired rap musical. That would have been interesting!estuous Kat who is won over by Patrick's wily charm in spite of herself.     The scene that is most remembered is in fact the one scene of pure joy and originality.

B001EYGOEM|3.0|\\"Even country music needs its own Britney Spears.\\"  That's what the store clerk who check me out said about the disk when I bought it.  I was gonna spout off a quick reply, something like 'thanks but no thanks for your opinion,' but then I thought about it: if Britney represents her values to her fans thru singing and songwriting, then sure Taylor Swift represents her values to her fans in the same way ... so I let the comment pass.<br /><br />Bursting onto the scene not very long ago (this is only her 2nd album), Taylor has quickly become a voice of empowerment for young women (and those young-at-heart!) everywhere.  Her lyrics are real -- based on her own \\"fearless\\" living -- and she deserves every ounce of recognition she's receiving in both the country and pop music communities.<br /><br />Fearless (4 out of 5)<br />\\"You take my hand and drag me headfirst fearless.\\"  Love, like life, is all about taking chances.<br /><br />Fifteen (3.5 out of 5)<br />Reflective, poetic in a mildly melancholy way.  \\"This is life before you know who you're gonna be.\\"<br /><br />Love Story (4.5 out of 5)<br />Ah, young love.  It always seems so real when you're in it, and it always seems so unreal when you're looking back on it.  William Shakespeasre's \\"Romeo & Juliet\\" never ended as happily as this confection sounds, but wouldn't the world be a better place if it did?  Easily one of the best tunes here.<br /><br />Hey Stephen (3.5 out of 5)<br />\\"I can't help it if you look like an angel.\\"  It sounds like someone named Stephen is getting lucky with Taylor, and deservedly so.  More celebration of young love, and I gave it an extract .5 just for Taylor's opening and closing humming.  Lovely.  What gives the song much of its charm is she allows her voice to be a bit more 'raw' and real than anywhere else on the album, which matches the lyrics perfectly.  (If my name were Stephen, it'd probably be a perfect 10 song!)<br /><br />White Horse (5 out of 5)<br />\\"I'm not a princess, this ain't no fairy tale ...\\"  Love gone bad and turned into disappointment never sounded quite so sorrowful as it does behind Taylor's youthful voice, tinking piano, soft guitar, and weeping strings.  Jilted girls everywhere will be crying into their pillows at bedtime with this song playing in the background.  \\"It's too late for you and your white horse to come around.\\"<br /><br />You Belong with Me (5 out of 5)<br />We've all been here before (in the middle of a friendship that coulda/shoulda/woulda been so, so much more), and perhaps that's why Taylor sounds so strong here.  She's a lyrical 'everyman,' capturing how we've all felt in the simplest terms.  Big refrain.  Crank it up.<br /><br />Breathe (4.5 out of 5)<br />Sorry, folks, but humming in music is so sexy, and Taylor works it to great effect here.  Unexpectantly.  Breathy.  And, yet, wholesome.  \\"You're the only thing that I know like the back of my hand.\\"  Getting past the mistakes made in a relationship pose the greatest challenges, and that's what this tune is all about.<br /><br />Tell Me Why (2.5 out of 5)<br />\\"You could write a book of how to ruin someone's perfect day.\\"  Ouch.  Getting past some of the mistakes made in a relationship (whoa ... deja vu) pose some challenges not quite worth enduring.<br /><br />You're Not Sorry (2.5 out of 5)<br />Wow.  Taylor Swift has an awful lot to say about being jilted in a relationship ... and at such a young age, too.  I'm starting to feel real bad for this gal.  Sad piano turns into a reflection on ending love.  Good song, but fairly repetitive to sentiments already explored on the disc.  Not the strongest tune here.<br /><br />The Way I Loved You (5 out of 5)<br />One of the strongest tracks here b/c, musically, it builds into something that you never expected.  A girl finds the perfect man (opens her doors, treats her like a lady, loves her parents, etc.) ... \\"but I miss screaming and fighting and kissing in the rain, it's 2 am and I'm cursing your name, I'mso in love that I acted insane, and that's the way I loved you.\\"  It's tragic when you realize that you love someone else more than the one you're with, and Taylor Swift hits a homerun of a hit here.<br /><br />Forever & Always (2 out of 5)<br />Sorry, but this is WAY too repetitive for the same themes already explored on this album.  And for Pete's sake, give this girl a hug!  Go and kiss her in the rain, already!  Heaven knows she needs it at this point!<br /><br />The Best Day (2.5 out of 5)<br />A young girl reminiscing about being an even younger girl.  Wonderfully poetic lyrics.<br /><br />Change (4.5 out of 5)<br />Pop country belted out the Taylor Swift way.  Sure, maybe it's a bit predictable, but it's a good kind of predictable.  All things change, and the true leaders predict it, welcome it, embrace it, celebrate it.  It's about making the world a better place.  \\"It's a revolution, throw your hands up 'cause we never gave in ...\\"<br /><br />So what's Taylor so FEARLESS about?  Clearly, it's love, and, while anyone can learn a world of lessons by plunging fearlessly into life's greatest mystery, there's a whole other series of lessons waiting for Taylor once the tempering effect that fear has on age.  Don't let my 3-star-rating scare you: this is one classy effort and deserves to bought, sold, and celebrated.  But what I'm more interested in is Taylor's command of lyrics.  I really want to see where this young soul will be in ten year's time.  I want to see her develop her skills beyond where she is today, and there's plenty of room (and time) for that to happen ... fearlessly or not.ove someone else more than the one you're with, and Taylor Swift hits a homerun of a hit here.

B00027JZ3E|5.0|pretty sweet movie! funny and sort of scary if your a child. just don't get the 2nd one it's the worst
B00003CX8N|3.0|The movie is charming and recalls a long-past time.  Because it seemed so realistic, my disbelief would not stay suspended and I wondered if it depicted to any extent the way people interacted in those days (World War II). Also, Ann Bancroft was supposed to look much younger in the beginning of the film to show the length of time the relationship went on, and that didn't work at all.  Techniques have come far since this film was made. All in all, I consider it a good addition to my dvd library.
1416562605|4.0|\\"The White Tiger\\", by the debutante novelist Aravind Adiga, is a story of a self-named Indian entrepreneur, Bikram Halwai (a.k.a. Munna,, a.k.a. The White Tiger, a.k.a Ashok Sharma), told by the protagonist himself in a form of letters to the Prime Minister of China, Wen Jiabao. During the seven nights, Bikram, like Scheherazade, weaves the story of his life, and how he came \\"per aspera ad astra\\" (at least, in his own opinion).<br /><br />Bikram, born in a small village of Laxmangarh, in the district of Gaya in Northern India, is considered an intelligent boy, quickly learns to read and write, which is considered a progress in his family, where the men work hard for meager money in mundane jobs (his father is a rickshaw driver), and then have to hand the money to the women to support the extended family. Everyone works only for the family and the dream of most (Bikram included) is to become a driver of a car. Pulled out of school, Bikram is apprenticed in the tea-shop, but he learns to drive and finds a job as a driver in a wealthy family in Dhabad, a district town. His ambitions, however, only grow, when he sees how the rich live and is introduced to the worldly ways of Delhi, where he is sent with his master, Ashok, who has to solve some income tax issues with the corrupt government. Bikram's aspirations result in the murder of Ashok... (not a spoiler - Bikram reveals it at the beginning, admitting this was a beginning of his financial independence, and the rest of the novel concentrates on the events leading to the killing).<br /><br /> This fresh and funny novel offers a contemporary perspective of the Indian society, something new and different from most of the Indian novels, mostly because of the fact that it is told in a voice of a member of a lower caste, a \\"half-baked\\", uneducated Indian, who worms his way into some money, sacrificing his family and name. However, the observations are not very deep, somehow schematic and not new to most of the people who know anything about India. Adiga, as a journalist, manages to tackle the important social issues.<br /><br />The author skillfully uses stereotypes, playing with the mix of literary influences - one can find here the echoes of many great writers, from Francis Scott Fitzgerald (the accident from \\"Great Gatsby\\" and taking the blame is reproduced with very slight changes) to George Orwell (the animal names of the village bosses). Unfortunately, these borrowings may display the author's literacy, but the novel's originality of concept suffers. This is probably the most important shortcoming; other that that, I have no criticism. Still, I think that Ghosh's novel deserved the Man Booker Prize more, but Adiga's debut shows promise and it is a good read.t India.

B001F0VHEM|4.0|This is a rousing and fun album. I have been listening to a lot of different music lately and this is a great work. Pink is really in the pink with this!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B001GAPC1K|5.0|This is one of those Blu-Ray movies you should have in your collection.  The movie looks like it did when i saw it in theaters.  The BD Live features are kind of cool, especially if it's your first BD Live title, but it shouldn't be the primary reason to buy this movie.
B001I8A76A|5.0|Being a long time fan of Pink, this was a different type of album from her but a beautiful demonstration of her versatility as a singer.<br />Yes, the album has some ballads. It's got more of a funky, Indy feel to it than a lot of her latest releases.<br /><br />Love it!
B001KQKC0Q|5.0|I absolutely LOVE this album!  I've already listened to it several times today.  Nickelback has a unique sound that's just amazing.  And I have to agree with another poster - some of their songs give me goosebumps . . .
055358894X|4.0|The Lies of Locke Lamora is surprisingly interesting, if not overly hyped, fantasy entry by a debut author who shows flashes of brilliance in his prose.  Perhaps the book's greatest strength is the way in which Lynch interweaves both the current exploits of the characters with the history of the land he's describing through well-placed interludes.<br /><br />Surprisingly, I wasn't hooked on the tale until around the 185 page mark where the scheming, lying, and just general conniving of the lead cast becomes more than just a novelty and instead an integral part of the plot.  I particularly enjoyed Lynch's ability of painting Locke and company into corners that even the most thorough reader cannot conceivably overcome.<br /><br />Also noteworthy is the author's commitment to realism in the form of lead character deaths.  Not to give any spoilers, let's just say that not everyone you'll come to know makes it to the end.  Additionally, his references to alien technology are certainly interesting and play a consistent role in the environment itself.<br /><br />It appears Lynch's use of modern slang/ profanity in Locke's dialog has been met with mixed reaction.  On the one hand he does an admirable job of creating a character with a nice dose of attitude in a world where only the strong survive.  On the other, there's little in terms of character maturity save for physical growth.<br /><br />The overall pacing is impressive thanks in no small part to the historical interludes mentioned above fitting neatly between chapters, which, themselves, are broken into multiple parts.  It's always easy to put off sleep, work, or other responsibilities with the logic \\"just one more section.\\"<br /><br />All in all, a fun read that does a commendable job steering clear of the more common fantasy genre clich&eacute;s with enough intrigue and personality to warrant some attention.  Based on what I've heard about the sequel, it's yet to be determined whether Lynch represents the next big thing in fantasy or happened to get lucky with The Lies of LL.The Lies of LL.
072325804X|5.0|I am very impressed with this book. It was all I had hoped it would be. I am also impressed with how fast it arrived and I didn't have to pay S & H! There are so many stories I can't wait to read to my granddaughter and the illustrations are just beautiful.I highly recommend this book to anyone who loves children's books.
B001EO2UKO|5.0|Dido's songs ring so true and captivate so easily despite how many times you've heard them, it's amazing to think it's been over five years since her last release.  Her journey from new fresh face to mature songwriter continues as she takes another stylistic turn.  Dido previously made some changes from debut to sophomore effort, using softer melodies and understated contentment to capture the listener.  This time, she's gone even further down that road, utilizing live instrumentations in a way we haven't yet heard from her.  The results are captivating and welcoming.<br /><br />During these last few years, Dido lived in Los Angeles, took long drives through the desert, worked with various renowned producers and writers, and lost her father.  The last event undoubtedly affected her writing most, and it was those producers that helped bring her creations to life in the most vibrant way.  Jon Brion, Brian Eno, Citizen Cope and Rick Nowels all contributed to the making of the album, and Dido's ever-present brother Rollo made his own mark on several tracks.  What's most exciting is Dido's progression as a writer and musician.  She learned more about drums, guitar and even took classes to enhance her inherent skills.<br /><br />\\"Safe Trip Home\\" sees Dido coming full circle.  On the heartbreaking \\"Grafton Street\\", the albums grand opus and tribute to Dido's father, she plays the recorder, one of the first instruments she ever mastered.  Dido wrote and recorded \\"Quiet Times\\" almost entirely on her own: The song includes her own drum and guitar playing.  As always, Dido presents the most honest and real feelings through her songs, particularly on \\"It Comes and It Goes\\", a song in which she confesses there are moments of doubt in the midst of clarity.  \\"Let's Do the Things We Normally Do\\" is a sneakily and ironically honest number in which Dido plays piano and asks to keep things simple and normal during the end of a relationship.  The lead single \\"Don't Believe In Love\\" includes a groovy bassline and Dido's realization to let love in or let it die.  She questions love again on \\"Never Want to Say It's Love\\", a laid back number with a moving chorus and Dido's pleasant hums scattered throughout.  Speaking of hums, the track \\"Us 2 Little Gods\\" is full of them as the music lightly bounces along.  \\"Look No Further\\" and \\"The Day Before the Day\\" are both sensitive and touching tracks without percussion, the former a softly inspirational tune and the latter a sad profession of loss.  Citizen Cope contributed vocals and guitar on \\"Burnin Love\\": His rasp isn't an obvious compliment to Dido's pure voice, but it's surprisingly right.  The closing \\"Northern Skies\\" shuffles along for nearly 9 minutes with a steady beat and memorable lyrics.<br /><br />The album is quite a departure from Dido's previous work.  But rest assured there are elements of familiarity.  There are quite a few electronic blips and bleeps, and even some of the live brass and strings were programmed and altered to sound unique to the album.  Though it's a softer album, \\"Safe Trip Home\\" has a quiet confidence and showcases a newfound maturity from Dido.  Even the album cover, a photo of astronaut Bruce McCandless II performing the first untethered spacewalk over Earth, suggests Dido herself is reaching out and letting go of some things.  It's as if she's settling down, coming back from a long journey through death and rebirth.  Thankfully, even the painful songs are somehow inspiring.
B001F7MSG6|5.0|Some of the reviewers are totally giving away the whole story!!  I want a review that does not just sum the movie up!  I don't feel like a long review today, only to say THE MOVIE IS WELL DONE, EVERYTHING I EXPECTED AND MORE AND GREAT FUN and I had to add my 5 stars to the rating today. I know It won't be a very helpful review but I got my 5 stars added.  Oh and this one's worth getting In Blu Ray  If you want to know what the whole plot Is In advance read others reviews on this movie.  Read the reviews on a movie like \\"Hellride\\" Quenten's new movie and you'll see reviews on how and why the movie works etc.Or does not!  Reviewers of this movie are not so good.
B001EOQWF8|5.0|Okay,there are 2 Blu Ray versions(2 disc and 3 disc,the only differnce being the 3rd disc on the 3 disc set is a digital copy for an Ipod,etc,other than that the contents ARE the same,okay!!!) of this soon to be classic with a true environmental message!!! My prediction come Oscar time is this WILL definatley get best animated film,hand down,Peter Gabriel's great song at the end of the film will probably get the best song statue,probably can't go up for best picture due to it's being an animated film,the Best Film Oscar will probably go to The Dark Knight!!! This IS a great movie!!! The 2 Blu Ray disc version is perfect for those who can live w/out the digital copy,like me,if you need it,get the 3 disc version!!! A perfect film for all ages!!! Very recommended!!! A+
1598875329|4.0|A very intertaining & interesting rendition of my favorite Christmas story, \\"A Christmas Carol by Charles Dickens\\".  I have over 30 different versions of this classic and this one is the most unique.  If you are a collector of \\"A Christmas Carol\\" you need to at least take a look.
B001GKJ2DO|5.0|To hell with critics, I really loved this movie! Saw it 8 times (4 times flying from Rio to NY and back).  I bet all the actors had a blast making this movie, and who would imagine Meryl Streep with such a pleasant voice and Pierce Brosnan, always associated with the debonair James Bond, singing! and not too bad either!  Don 't let the critics win you over, just go and see it! I bet you'll leave the theater singing and wishing you were a part of the cast!
0316017922|1.0|Enough already with these books. It's common sense. Nothing deep here. Mr. Gladwell's books are all the same - mindless dribble for those just this side of reality tv.  Kudos for proving your point though!
B001ACH4DS|5.0|I've road tested the album and it delivers.  Both \\"Bar-Ba-Sol\\" and \\"A Daily AntheM\\" as well as \\"Heroes\\" are all great car sing-along songs.  The album has a cohesive flow from beginning to end and I am in love with it.  Cannot wait to see how future singles perform.  I expect \\"Declaration\\" to be huge and \\"Permanent\\" is beautiful, tug-at-the-heartstrings ballad.    And if you haven't listened to Cook's 2006 indie release \\"Analog Heart\\".  Do. It. Now.
0307386171|5.0|With meticulous precision, Ian McEwan examines the wedding night of an innocent couple, who marry in 1962 and spend their first night alone together at a hotel on Chesil Beach. In always elegant prose, McEwan displays his great gift for describing the particular and making it universal. In this case, he turns his jeweler's eye on the misunderstandings between a young man and young woman, deeply in love and deeply inhibited. Recommended for anyone who has ever loved or hoped to love.

B0014DZ2VO|4.0|[[ASIN:1424172705 Fete of Death]]<br />Even with Daniel Craig as Bond, \\"Quantum of Solace\\" (QoS) is not as good as \\"Casino Royale,\\" one of the best of the gilt-edged Bonds.  \\"Casino Royale,\\" by the way, is also Ian Fleming's best-written Bond novel.  \\"QoS\\" is still a rollicking good action thriller film.<br /><br />It stars Craig returning as the 21st-century, post-9/11 Bond, a blue-collar, Americanized, if you will, Bond.  Craig hasn't the suavity of a Roger Moore or a Sean Connery.  Craig is more a London thug clad in a<br />Saville Row single-breasted suit than he is an upper-class Cambridge-educated Brit.<br /><br />Stripped of his gadgets in \\"QoS,\\" Bond is a lean, mean, killing machine, a ruthless murderer who, like Vince Flynn's Mitch Rapp or \\"24\\"'s Jack Bauer, doesn't bat an eye when it comes to torturing, or, for that matter, whacking the enemy.<br /><br />I found the opening car-chase scene difficult to follow, difficult to perceive because I couldn't get my bearings what with the quick cuts, jump cuts, and all-around jerky camera work.  The frenetic scene, however, did set the tone for the film to come--basically an extended chase scene that lasts throughout the length of the film.  Bent on revenge, Bond single-mindedly tracks the man responsible for his lover Vesper Lynd's death.  That is, \\"QoS\\" takes up where \\"Casino Royale\\" left off.<br /><br />The director Marc Forster makes a lot of use of crosscutting in \\"QoS\\" to effectively enhance the suspense, as in the scene where Bond is chasing the Quantum agent who is a mole in Britain's MI6 (aka SIS) and serving as M's bodyguard, no less. Forster keeps crosscutting between the chase and the horses racing outside--and then Bond winds up chasing the enemy into the horse race.<br /><br />\\"QoS\\" is one of the better Bond films, but it's not in the same league with either \\"Casino Royale\\" or \\"Goldfinger,\\" the Bond movie that set the standard for all 007 films to come.<br /><br />Another difference between the new Bond movies starring Craig vis-a-vis the earlier Bond movies is the final showdown.  In the preceding Bond movies, there is the requisite army of good guys converging on an army of bad guys in a massive, free-for-all shootout.  In \\"Casino Royale\\" and \\"QoS\\" Bond for the most part goes it alone.  This is especially true in \\"QoS\\" where he is considered a rogue agent by M who wants him put out of action as a loner with a grudge.<br /><br />--Bryan Cassiday, author of \\"Fete of Death\\"vies is the final showdown.

B001ED7C58|5.0|It started out as idle curiousity - what's all the hype?  My young adult daughter brought the book home to share and after the first chapter, I was hooked.  How unusual to be considered a \\"groupie\\" when I could be the mother of any one of the cast.    The Twilight soundtrack was interesting. I'd listened to the playlist on Stephanie Meyer's website first.  Honestyl, I hadn't really heard of all the groups but found the songs relevant to the book content.    Can't wait to see the movie.  We'll be some of those crazy people waiting in line tomorrow night at midnight.    I must be outta my mind!
B000007SPU|3.0|Drawing on the immense and varied talent signed to his record label 4AD, Ivo Watts-Russell created the collaborative project This Mortal Coil, specializing mainly in covers of Russell's favorite songs. A first album called [[ASIN:B000004B9T It'll End in Tears]] appeared in 1984. FILIGREE & SHADOW was the second effort and came out in 1986.<br /><br />The line-up has changed somewhat on this release. Elizabeth Frazer and Robin Guthrie of Cocteau Twins don't appear, but their bassist Simon Raymonde came on board and contributed a great deal. Similarly Brendan Perry and Lisa Gerrard of Dead Can Dance didn't participate, but their drummer Peter Ulrich contributed percussion to some tracks here. The sisters Deidre and Rutkowski, and Breathless singer Dominic Appleton provide here most of the vocals. Two members of Dif Juz contribute a certain ambience.<br /><br />True to its mission of cover songs, This Mortal Coil here gives us versions of songs by Tim Buckley, Colin Newman, Talking Heads, Pearls Before Swine, Gene Clark, Judy Collins, Colourbox, and Van Morrison. Yet, there is a new use of ambient tracks in between the cover songs, most of which are by Russell and 4AD producer John Fryer. As the album opens, for example, we hear the cello ostinato \\"Velvet Belly\\" before Appleton breaks in with the vaguely Gallic vocals of Pearls Before Swine's \\"The Jeweller\\". In between QMS' \\"Firebrothers\\" and Tim Buckley's \\"I Must Have Been Blind\\", we hear the synthesizer murmuring of \\"Thais\\".<br /><br />While I find this album interesting enough as background listening, I don't think it is as successful as most 4AD output of this era, and the album's melancholy can seem monotone and grating. Unlike the first album, which transformed some songs for the better (Chilton's \\"Kangaroo\\", Buckley's \\"Song to the Siren\\"), we could have gotten by without these covers. Nonetheless, for fans of the 4AD aesthetic, especially its darkwave tendencies, this is an album worth at least encountering.
B001ED7C58|4.0|When I purchased this the day it was released, I was disappointed in some of the songs. I really liked \\"Decode\\", \\"Spotlight\\", \\"Leave Out All the Rest\\" and \\"Eyes on Fire\\", but thought the rest were off mark. I agree the \\"Go All the Way\\" disco-tech song seems way out of place with all of the other dark songs, but the rest seem pretty good. I really like \\"Bella's Lullaby\\" as a song, but it does not really fit with what the book described. Rob Pattinson's song was well done, although I wish you could hear his voice a bit better, he seems like he's mumbling a little. All in all, I am pleased with it more now. I think it just takes some getting used to. I am interested to see how many of these songs are actually used in the movie (not the end credits). I am also looking forward to the release of the movie score. I think I will like it a lot.
