B00BB8T9FC|4.0|It is a very good true-to-life story with some great actors. The subjects covered are definitely adult content - I would not recommend it for pre-teen children.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|My grandchildren downloaded this game on ALL of our kindles and my oldest daughters boyfriend saw them playing it and he had to have it too.  He is 40 years old.  Goes to show you that no matter how old you are you are never to old to play.  Thanks for a great game the whole family can enjoy.
B00DYEN5QU|5.0|Trying to limit spoilers.<br />I'm not a film Critic. I have no credentials. I'm a fan of most things geek. I loved it.<br /><br />I went to this movie with two mindsets. One mind set was callous one which was saying; \\"I can't believe they changed his outfit, they better not screw anything else up.\\" The other mindset was the open realizing; \\"No movie can live up to your imagination. Not Game of Thrones, Not the Hobbit; Nothing can live up to the power of my imagination, so take it as it is and trust that it was done earnestly.\\"<br /><br />Superhero movies have been getting better and better with each Generation of them since the death of them in 1997 at the hands of Batman & Robin. In my opinion it started with X-Men in the year 2000, then Spiderman 2002. Not that they were very good but they proved that Comic book are packed with stories primed for the big screen. I think X-Men and Spiderman were the stepping stones for the other comic book movies.<br /><br />Batman Begins (2005), I believe, set a new standard for origin stories and comic book movies. But the DC universe didn't capitalize on it. They dropped the ball with \\"Superman Returns\\" (2006); not that it was a bad movie, it just wasn't new, it was still standing on Christopher Reeves.<br /><br />Instead, someone at Marvel saw the big picture of the universe they created and worked towards presenting the best of that world starting in 2008, Creating Iron-Man, Hulk, Thor and Captain America and bringing them together as the Avengers with Nick Fury and Shield under genius of Joss Whedon. Not only did they succeed but I believe they pulled through with out sacrificing their characters, costume or story.<br /><br />Now in a post Avengers, post Hulk Smash world DC is getting their act together, but, also, keeping the \\"realism\\" torch lit by Nolan's Batman Begins. Batman's suit was built with utility in mind. They Couldn't come up with a story to Sell the classic Superman suit to the audience so they threw that away.Not sure if they tried or if that was the first thing to go. However; they did present a Krypton that gave back story enough for a big symbol on the chest and a cape, which was enough for me to acquiesce to the new suit.<br /><br />Some how as I watched the film, the callous side of me was stripped away. Perhaps I was tired of being mad, bitter, and shaking my fist at people scribbling on things solidified in my imagination. Or perhaps this film captivated me as I watched something new come from the longest lived, most popular, most known superhero of my time.<br /><br />The amazing action was almost an apology for \\"Superman Returns\\" and at the same time an answer to the post Avengers' Hulk; \\"Can 'Man of Steel' smash?\\" Answer: Yes. To me, the action was a big nod to the Superman Fans as to say, you knew all along this is how Superman can fight, and now we can finally make it happen, live action.<br /><br />The origin, the whole movie was basically Superman's origin story. Honestly, it wasn't until the very end of the movie, nearly the last scene, that I felt like Clark, Kal, actually became Superman. As I watched it and saw him do all the things he did, never in my mind past the notion, \\"This is Superman\\".<br /><br />After leaving the Theater and thinking, meditating, I still didn't feel like it was a Superman movie. I still hold Christopher Reeves as THE Superman And Brandon Routh as the next best thing. But the following week I went back and watched it again. I liked it just as much the second time. I still didn't feel \\"Superman\\" but now this is a new feeling. This is not Superman, but The Man of Steel.<br /><br />Maybe I will see Superman in the next movie, until then, I am happy with the Man of Steel.
B0086700CM|5.0|Game has good graphics and is interesting to play. Action is fast paced but still manageable by young children. Higher levels of the game should hold the interest of more serious game players.
B008CPZNL6|1.0|I did not read it - it was not to my interest.  Sorry for the low rating, but not something that was to my liking.
B009PNQUXO|1.0|Again I can't rate something I don't have. But if I do some grandchildren will be lectured because I have seen other Your Tube on other phones and do not think that some of the content is suitable for any age to see.
B004UJAOLM|1.0|Not worth the time it takes to strugglr though the vocabulary and dialect.  Glad I had the choice to put it down and did not have to read it for a literature class
B004W2UBYW|4.0|I think it is excellent and I learned things about him I did not know.  He was a fascinating and extremely creative person.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|The horses are so cute. My sister loves it so much more than I so I let my sister play on it. It is awesome and I play with it over and over again.
B000A1SZ2Y|5.0|Highly detailed macro photography is possible with this lens. I have use this lens for flowers and it captures way beyond the naked eye.
B009DCOU9S|4.0|it was good. I enjoyed playing it. I would like to see more of this kind of games. thank you
B004EPZ06Q|3.0|I must be too old or mature for it 'cuz it did not do it for me.<br />I wouldn't recommend it.
B00632HWOG|2.0|I downloaded this on my Kindle in anticipation of a trip out west.  I thought it would be useful to stay up on e-mail while we were away.  It was not user friendly at all.  I looked at e-mail once and was frustrated that I could not seem to find where to sign out.  There were other glitches and problems with using it too.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love Subway Surfers fast pace game for children and adults of all ages. Easy to play.<br />recommend it for long trips were children can get bored.
B009WUAK2M|5.0|I just  love all the actors in this movie,some were funny,some were action packed big time.i would watch it again.
145210655X|3.0|I was hoping this would be a good book for hubs for fathers day.  It came late so that was a bummer.  But aside from that its not a great story book for a kid.  Its humor and story line is more mature, not in content but in how it is written.
B00004TJKI|4.0|I consider this a classic movie with great actors in<br />good roles for them.  As most of my purchases, I am replacing old VHS.<br />The quality is good.  Remember this is a 1940's-1950's movie and some<br />of the acting is dated.
B0082RHRHC|4.0|A truly enjoyable read.  The story was not what I expected,  and it's unpredictableness was a treat.  Read this book, you won't regret it.
B008NCSZQ8|4.0|I would have given 5 stars if I had seen it all im sure,i haven't had the time to watch the whole movie yet.but I will soon.
B005MYEPXC|1.0|I was very upset to open this DVD to find out it was fake; my blue ray player nor my computer were able to read the disc. I would appreciate a full refund.<br /><br />Thank you.<br />Tina
B00992CF6W|5.0|You can do everything yayyyy am love MC its So AWSOME  UPDATED WERE THERES ALOT OF STUFF OF YOU DONT HAVE DELETE IS AND RE GET IT SRRY TRY TO REACH 20
B0087X728K|5.0|I've been using this product for several years. It gives great heat transfer. Used on a Asus mobo with a qcore processor and a Zelman cooler.
B0042X9L6A|5.0|I would recommend getting the 700 over the newer versions out from Nikon because it has every feature you will need for professional work or just for fun.
B008AT9XOC|5.0|I bought this for my 16 year old son, who is in theatre arts in HS.  He wants to act on Broadway! He absolutely loved it!  As did I, after all these years!!!
B009KS4XRO|1.0|The updates are horrible. You end up with a lot of items on ones you cannot either gift or trade. Wasting credits so that the company tries to sell more. Not fun anymore.
B009K72G8I|3.0|Tied it up too quickly and easily, but still an enjoyable episode.  It adds a lot to the reason for Anakins demeanor in Ep 3.  Means he wasn't just manipulated by the emperor, but had some legitimate grievances.  His transition from good to out of control always felt too quick to me, even with the clone wars series.  This episode was the missing link for me.  I wish it had more time to seem plausible, at least a two parter.  Also, Anakins duel with a Padawan was a little too even.  He should've owned her, but you did get to see some of the rage he exhibits later.  Dealing with two characters he showed his psycho hat a little.
B001NLL8LA|5.0|Another great book! Good guys...bad guys and Jack right in the middle. This one shows he is somewhat vulnerable but he just gets tougher and meaner!!
B00574P9EQ|4.0|We love the books but did not love the first installment. Rodrick Rules was a much better movie with great laughs and more fully realized characters!
B00DJFIMW6|1.0|I installed and unistalled this app several times and gets stuck on the loading screen... really wanted to be able to use app.
1597801585|5.0|This was a  fun read. Great visual story telling. Seriously. it would make an awesome and original movie. I am going to read more stuff from this author.
B001MEJY8W|5.0|A champion swimmer and her family are having a quiet meal when someone tries to break into their house. The story  is comparatively straightforward, but there are several flashbacks and nightmares, many of them ugly, and enough different focuses of action to make this movie seem really varied. If you can concentrate on it for 90m or so and keep telling yourself that it's only a film, it's quite possible you will enjoy it because it is so well made and substantial. The three young female leads are very attractive, and one of them physically exploits the camera expertly during scenes which must have been very hard to play. The villains and heroes are eventually very well defined, and the action is extremely gory and jarring, so much so that if you are sqeamish some scenes may make you feel sick. It is not as violent as The Hills Have Eyes but it is much scarier, and could have been made even worse if the makers had decided to show a key scene onscreen. As a result I am not entirely convinced that the film makers were paying close attention during their How To Frighten An Audience course.  You will want to leave several days between viewings of this extreme film, but repeated showings do get rewarded. The best print has the faces at the very top with the title in red letters on the front cover, and Eurocult Uncut on the back cover. The brief yellow English subtitles disappear quickly from the screen and do not get in the way. 16/9.
B008Y768XO|5.0|What a tear jerker. Awesome movie!  I would highly recommend this movie which highlights a dog and his faithfulness to his master even after the master dies.  Wonderful!!!
B00BLGY8X2|2.0|We decided to rent this movie after watching the preview. We are fans of foreign films (especially French) and were intrigued by the trailer. Alas, it was... maybe too artistic for our taste? We just couldn't grasp the concept. It was visually rather remarkable but just too weird for us. Just not our taste.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|i love this game im very obessed!!!!!!! its cute too i love the part where i ride a unicorn! awsome game
B001EC2ISA|5.0|Fun Fun fun movie. My eight year old and her 12 year old cousin loved it!  Although the eight year old did get scared during some parts.  The happy ending makes up for everything.
0307895505|5.0|This is the most detailed book from the most detailed game I have ever played!  There is so much information.  Excellent summary of the missing but general information from the game in the first hundred pages or so.  Then it details the major plot lines and from all three additions to the game to bring this game to the legendary status.  On top of all the actual plot quests, there is also a detailed summary of each area or province and the major, main, and minor incident points.  It comes with a pull out map but there is so much on the map it can be hard to read until you have played the game more.  Also, it links you to an online site where you can easily retrieve information online geographically.  The Table of Contents is very useful.  Overall, this is an amazing compiled product of details from people who have spent so much time on this game.  This book only begins to bring justice to the level of detail and breadth the amazing Skyrim game provides.  I highly recommend it to anyone playing the game and for the cost it is well worth the money spent!
B004QZ9PLU|5.0|I loved it. I enjoy all of Nicholas Sparks books. They are very easy reading and I love romantic stories.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|this game is very adicting and tons of fun. it is a little hard making sure not to hurt the minion but loads of fun.
B004SIIBGU|5.0|very easy to navigate and place bids. search is easy to use. I like the quick bid option. highly recommend
B00352B46Y|5.0|Huxley's insight into the cosmos is undeniably powerful. This is one of those books where the author so effortlessly describes those intangible and elusive thoughts you may have carried with you for a long time. It is at times strange and challenging but I think those are the bet kinds of books. It cut me into a thousand tiny pieces.
B003O86FMW|5.0|It's hard writing sequels. I don't know if the author had a trilogy in mind and if the entire story was already planned in front of her. But even so, writing a sequel is hard: the characters have made a home in the reader's mind and it's a gamble to rattle this house and send the same characters into anew adventure, from which they may never return.<br />Having said that, I have to say that this book have exceeded every expectation I've had. It is by far better written than the first, and even Katniss is much less annoying with her teenager logic.<br />A great sequel, and an awesome return to the land of Panem.
B003Y5H5HO|5.0|Excellent on it's own and viewable multiple times.  After a long delay watched both versions, back to back.  Without question the original is less abridged and the story feels more complete.  Cinematically both films have advantages, this one with a more polished look, but the originals style is less abtrusive and organic.  So.. This version is excellent but not as excellent as the originals.  Maybe the next two will surpass the originals.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This game is awesome! It works great on my Kindle Fire HD and I really enjoy it! I first got Temple Run and loved that but Temple Run 2 is as good as it gets! Great graphics, sounds, effects, and so much more making this game a must-have!
B007KAJG3K|5.0|Love this movie....the first as well!!!  I've watched them both many times.  I really do like movies that are off beat...and clean. Music is fantastic!!!
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love this app.  It is user-friendly.  It has a nice looking display that is pleasing to the eye.  Easy to pin.
B00992CF6W|5.0|It's awesome but can you make the update early like the IPhone or something?<br />And can you add Redstone torches,hungry gui,and a wolf?
B0058YPILY|5.0|I really like criminal  minds. I found a decent deal on season 7 with some seller here on Amazon (madd media). Unfortunately, I waited too long to get to this particular season because I wanted to watch the first 6. When I got to season 7, the disks and packaging looked authentic; however, the quality looks like someone copied them from vhs tapes. All other seasons look as good as Blu-ray and they are only standard dvd. So when you buy something from one of these other sellers here on Amazon make sure you test the quality of all dvds. This is happening everywhere. I had the same problem on ebay. You can't trust anyone these days, it seems like. I should have purchased from trusted Amazon seller. Wasted 30 bucks.
B00127RAJY|5.0|I loved it thank you. Cant wait to start my work outs.  So excited. Service was fast and very easy.
B00AOCLWF6|4.0|I have been wanting to try out this show, but having missed so many episodes, I was glad to see it on Amazon. The quality of the streaming was great.
0810979772|1.0|I ordered this for my 8 year old.  We just received it and the whole book is already filled in! What a disappointment and waste as now I will have to order another.
B00A3XWB10|4.0|CRASHDIET's The Savage Playground is one of the best albums of new music that I have purchased in a long time.  It is raw and energetic like the best of the 80's &#34;hair&#34; metal bands.  And I DO NOT mean that to be derogatory. It is a great compliment.  I would love to see this guys live!  If you like the harder 80's bands like GNR, Motley Crue or Skid Row, I believe that you would like CRASHDIET!
B000VZJUGY|4.0|This album is a classic. High school wouldnt have been the same with out the trance inducing sounds of Trent Reznor and gang. I saw it for $5 bucks on Amazon MP3....how can you pass that up?
0307730700|5.0|Excellent book! Highly recommend! The story follows Adam, a young man with problems that should have ruined his life. Instead, he rises above his demons and works his way to the top of the United States military. Throughout his military career, he works hard to be a loving father and good person.
B006OCM0G0|3.0|Why are all the items SO expensive?!?! Just when I think I have enough coin saved to decorate the game asks you go and buy 8 $20000 tables. Sure it's fictional money but how can we advance when we have to spend all of our coin on decorations to complete goals? Teamlava should consider reducing the item pricing in the game or give us more coin for each item served. Also some of the cooking times are ridiculous. Starting to think this is a ploy to get people to spend real money. Not cool if it's supposed to be a free game.
1781162646|5.0|Loved this mystery. Great characters, setting and plot. Loved it, perfect summer read. Stephen king has written another fantastic story.
B00CLT31D6|3.0|This book was interesting, but the authors could have cut out huge chunks of it without us missing the message.  They also were more preaching their message of frugality than just giving us straight information.  It was almost like saving a lot of money and becoming a millionaire was an end in itself.  There was not much discussion of what do you do once you amass your fortune, other than the message of never give it to your kids.
B00555X8OA|5.0|I really enjoyed understanding how most people, as well as myself, are committing similar flawed thinking...a must read for anyone stumped by the pervasive superficial level of brain power in our world...
B00B4FU6KE|3.0|I loved the concept of the story but felt it fell somewhat flat.  I was fascinated and then bored.  All in all a pretty good read.
B00003CXRM|5.0|Love this movie. I have watched it many times and always see something different. I'm still trying to figure out what the cows meaning is in the film. . I'm dumbfounded! .  My guy is from (well his background is) West Virginia and he says it reminds him of home. It's a great watch. .
B009XIXVU6|5.0|I've read reviews that this is too much like his other novels, but I disagree. It's a beautifully written and creatively crafted story that makes the reader reflect on his own life, family, and values. Great read!
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Spanning generations and continents, revealing the mysteries spoken and unspoken that make us the people we are, this story has all of the great elements and themes which echo back to our hearts and souls our own cracks and crevices, longings and attachments.  I loved it.
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|Great game, wish I didn't run out of energy though. I don't think collecting should cost you energy. But totally addicted
B00B4Z5J92|5.0|Really great, Dave Grohl is now my hero! Really, some great stuff on a recording studio and it's mixing board that really made a difference in the history of our popular music
B008602KQI|4.0|It was a good movie.  it followed the book well, which is a positive in my mind.  Since it has been awhile since i read the book, some of the minor characters could have been introduced better.  I will be seeing the second movie in the Fall.
B008JGSM6G|1.0|Lame, wish it was more complicated also it's not that fun because there isn't anything fun about it and I wish it had a background in the back, lik seriously
B009XIXVU6|4.0|Picturesquely written with a very heartwarming and heart wrenching storyline. At times difficult to follow for the jumping back and forth in time. Certainly made you have to think back on what had occurred in prior chapters in order to knit the story together. Really enjoyed it in spite of this unusual writing style.
B005544V6A|4.0|Good premise, edgy and entertaining. The computer says that I have to say fifteen more words, so watch the show I think you might like it.
B002BVQU5A|5.0|This was a great light comedy with a nice ending.  Great movies after a hectic week.  It left me smiling.
B00CO8TBR4|5.0|For many years i've been stuck in a never ending loop of AMD processors from the Athlon 3000+, to a Sempron SI-42, then to a Turion II M540. The last time i've owned an Intel based machine was back in 2000 with the Compaq presario 5000, which had a 600 MHz  Celeron. Needless to say I've been long overdue for an upgrade, and boy have i found one. PerformanceTest gives The Turion II M540 a score of around 1400, but the Core i5 4670 reaches 8000. This is a decent jump in total processing power. It may not have the fancy hyper threading of the Core i7, and it may not have the unlocked multiplier of the 4670K, but it's been suiting my needs just fine. It can handle foreground multitasking quite well in all tests that i've thrown at it. This includes running a game, 1080p video, and YouTube vids all at the same time. I'd also like to point out that this processor also handles Fraps extremely well if you plan on building a budget gaming PC for doing Let's Plays on. Just remember to use a separate and dedicated hard drive for recording for the best frame rates.<br /><br />This is how it performs for PerformanceTest 8.0 64bit:<br /><br />overall score: 8092<br /><br />Integer Math: 9975<br />Floating Point Math: 8905<br />Prime Numbers: 35.7<br />Extended Instructions (SSE): 28.4<br />Compression: 9608<br />Encryption: 1485<br />Physics: 513<br />Sorting: 6101<br />Single Threaded: 2250<br /><br />Pros:<br />-Fast!<br />-4 cores<br />-can support up to 32GB of RAM<br />-dynamically clocks itself for optimal power efficiency<br />-produces very little heat at idle<br />-can turn off multiple cores in the BIOS for more power efficiency<br />-turbo boosts itself to 3.8 GHz in a pinch<br />-built in graphics are quite powerful<br /><br />Cons:<br />-runs worryingly hot during full load<br />-stock cooler is lack luster at best<br />-have run into issues with the built in graphics' memory (64MB?)<br />-only 6MB of cache<br />-only supports up to dual channel memory, no quad channel :(<br />-new 1150 socket requires a new motherboard (i think the 5 extra pins could have stayed...)<br />-extremely limited overclocking options (this is not the &#34;K&#34; version)<br />-the new case sticker is microscopic (slightly larger than my thumbnail...)<br />-nagging feeling of being a cheapo because you didn't buy a Core i7 (maybe it's just me)<br />-the creepy statue on the box has been giving me nightmares...

B00746O3X8|5.0|I use it while backpacking and I love that my camera is easily accessible and safely secured and not dangling at the same time.
0618526412|5.0|This was recommended for my son's summer reading program.  It has kept his attention and yet it is not too cumbersome in size or readability.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Fantastic depiction of a not often portrayed era full of witty banter and an engrossing plot.  Very excited for the next season!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is completely worth it, hilarious, and it had great graphics.<br />Most people complain about speed, but its not even that slow, its just like any other game as far as loading time, totally worth the download!
B00EI6E0QM|5.0|Catchy, infectious, & brilliant. The comeback single for American superstar Lady Gaga is nothing short of spectacular. Takes a few listens, but this pop masterpiece truly is that. Bringing in the world of ART to such a POP-centric world. She really knows what she is doing, and is playing her cards oh so right.
B00BEZTMQ8|5.0|I loved this movie, as I loved the book! A good, exciting movie! I highly recommend it to ALL! Buy it, watch it, love it.
B00DRPVE3M|1.0|Game would take coins it &quot;cost&quot; to play then crash. This happened several times so I uninstalled the game. Enough!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Super fun and addicting! Love the graphics and the obstacles. I cannot stop playing it! Lots of fun...did I mention fun? Yup, FUN!
B00AE9UYJ4|5.0|This was my first time playing. If you play outside in the light it's not so scary. But no, I had to play alone in my room with no lights on. Wow. Don't get this game if you don't like screaming your face off. But if you do get this game. ;)
B008WCP2KG|5.0|Magic Mike (Channing Tatum) was a hit, all the way! Hope to see much more of this sexy man! So, yeah, great movie, good buy!
B005PK57NU|5.0|This is one of my all time favorite shows to watch.  Being able to watch it on Amazon is a real treat.
B00594XOZU|4.0|I like this app because you can talk to more than one person at a time and share pictures. There is one thing I would like to suggest when you are taking your profile picture, you will have to make it smaller and you can't edit the pictures either so that would be nice.
B000P0J09W|3.0|When this movie first came out, I liked it very much.  In todays comparisons it is alright.  I still enjoyed the movie.
B000ID37SQ|5.0|I really luv this movie and i will watch it over and over again... Thats the street credibility * Get Rich or Die Trying
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|This is such a great show.  I can't wait for next season!  I highly recommend it to those of you who like shows of this era.
0553801473|5.0|People on the Internet can be bitchy about things. This much should be obvious. I was startled even still when I read some of the reviews for A Feast for Crows and A Dance with Dragons online. I read these whiny and unfavorable reviews BEFORE I read books 4 and 5, and I still loved BOTH of them.<br /><br />Fans of A Song of Ice and Fire, don't take the bitchy reviews to heart for books 4 and 5. DO they have negative qualities? Yes, but not nearly as many as they would leave you to believe. In ADwD, Jon and Daenerys have slower and less eventful storylines than in the previous novels, but they still have a LOT of buildup for some GREAT moments to come, and they have some compelling and climactic moments towards the end.<br /><br />The other storylines are FANTASTIC in ADwD. Bran, Arya, Tyrion, Theon, and many others lead compelling stories, and thanks to the buildup in A Feast for Crows and A Dance with Dragons, The Winds of Winter could EASILY end up being the best book in the series so far!!!
B004GJYROG|3.0|Living in Chicago and rooting for the Bulls, my kids and I enjoyed the movie when it came out.  Today it has lost its shine and it's okay
0062020889|4.0|I really enjoyed the cast of characters. Fillet gave me a reason to care about the bad guys. But I was still pulling for the hero. Cool book based on historical events that I remember from my youth.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|I'm not real big on hidden object games, but this one has kept me very intrigued. I'm really enjoying it, there hasn't been a lot of the hidden object puzzles.
034580404X|5.0|These are great books and it said used but they look brand new there wasn't anything wrong with them at all!!
B00005JKNF|5.0|This movie captures England in its time.  The cast is a delight.  It does have some sound distortions but the captions help.
B009WUAK2M|1.0|I've caught a case of terminal nausea from watching this \\"movie'.<br />I can't go on living from either the pain or the shame that I having knowing that I took time away from my family to watch this horrid spectacle.<br />So please:  somebody shoot me.
B005CMSDLE|5.0|Ok, so this movie is amazing for one. :) And I'm glad I found it for a cheap price, well worth the buy. :) And yes I did watch it before buying it. Love it so much. :D
B009ZQC7MY|4.0|Wife and I disagreed on this series.  I thought it was excellent but a little contrived at times; she thought it was even better than Season 2. Anyway, we learn that Downton can survive without a second footman, but perhaps not for too long.  Acting by Michelle Dockery continues to be stellar.  Her work during a certain scene surrounding the death of a certain character was particularly brilliant. Maggie Smith gets too many one-liners but delivers them brilliantly. The Bates subplot might have benefitted from a trifle more legal realism.

B001UGB1X8|3.0|IN THE ELECTRIC MIST, (In the Electric Mist with Confederate Dead), (2008). This 102 minute thriller, helmed by the well-thought of French director Bertrand Tavernier, ([[ASIN:B000SOSS5W Round Midnight]]) centers on characters created by beloved, bestselling American author of crime dramas, James Lee Burke.  The mystery is set in and around New Orleans, Burke's home, French-speaking turf, after the terrible damage inflicted  on the region in 2005 by Hurricane Katrina.  Principally, it tells us of troubled former New Orleans Police Detective Dave Robicheaux, now a deputy sheriff in neighboring Iberia County. The lead part is fully inhabited by veteran Texas-born actor Tommy Lee Jones, ([[ASIN:B0011E7JBW Men In Black]], [[ASIN:B001EBYM8A The Fugitive]]), who might well have been born to play it, as it was created by the Texas Panhandle-born Burke.<br /><br />The stubborn Robichaux, haunted by his service in the Vietnam War, struggling with a drinking problem, is, as ever, ignoring warnings to leave the local messes alone.  He begins to investigate the possible connections between a series of torture murders of local prostitutes, a 1976 lynching that he witnessed 35 years before as a young boy, and Julie `Baby Feet' Balboni, a notorious New Orleans gangster, played by the popular St. Louis-born John Goodman,([[ASIN:6305262268 The Big Easy]]). The Southern-born Mary Steenburgen, ([[ASIN:B002VV8MQK Cross Creek]]), plays Bootsie, the detective's second wife.  Peter Sarsgaard, ([[ASIN:B000X3OHVC Year of the Dog]]), plays actor Elrod Sykes, filming locally; Kelly Macdonald, ([[ASIN:B0019WOYSC Intermission]]), is Sykes' girlfriend Kelly Drummond.  Ned Beatty, ([[ASIN:B00BUVA594 Hear My Song]]) plays local rich man/bad guy Twinky LeMoyne.  Noted American musician Levon Helm plays long-dead General John Bell Hood, a Civil War stalwart who suddenly starts appearing to and chatting with Robicheaux and Sykes.  Noted American bluesman Buddy Guy plays local bluesman Sam `Hogman' Patin.  Director John Sayles plays Michael Goldman, producer of the picture filming locally. Marco Beltrami created the evocative score; Bruno de Keyzer, the cinematography.  The plot sticks recognizably close to Burke's underlying novel of the same name,[[ASIN:1439167605 In the Electric Mist with Confederate Dead ]].<br /><br />Jones nails the part of Burke's detective, giving us a rounded performance that shows the complex nature of the character, violent one minute, tender the next.  He is miles better than Alec Baldwin, who was laughably miscast as the detective in HEAVENS PRISONERS.  And it's not a bad movie.  Yet, my understanding is that, although this film was made for theatrical release, it eventually went directly to DVD, which is probably why I, for one, although I am a Burke fan, never knew of its existence until I was informed of it by my Amazon friends.  I think some major structural problems may have caused that outcome.  Any Burke fan will know the detective's best friend, another former NOPD detective, Clete Purcel, overweight, sunburnt, heavy drinker, violent, everlastingly loyal, also native to NO's Irish Channel. Therefore, any Burke fan who has been to the movies a few times, in seeing the cast list before seeing the picture, will expect that Ned Beatty is playing Purcel.  I did.  But, somehow, the Purcel character isn't there, and Beatty is playing one of the heavies.  Also, Goodman has long been associated with The Big Easy, and it was perfectly reasonable to cast him as the gangster in this gritty film.  But Goodman, I believe, is a popular actor, and I suspect people may be uncomfortable with the way he is here treated.  I was.  Both these misjudgments create a film that's disappointing, but I still enjoyed it, as most Burke fans might.tin.  Director John Sayles plays Michael Goldman, producer of the picture filming locally.

B0050DIWFC|4.0|What's really interesting, to me at least, is that this rather procedural murder trial novel of an accused teenage boy is told from the father's point of view. It may be that I've been  reading mostly women authors lately but this was a refreshing difference. There's a dispassionate sort of passion in the father's narration that rings true as the voice of an introverted man who is also a prosecutor. There are a couple of surprises and twists that keep things moving along, even when the author bogs down in the courtroom scenes. I'm sure that someone, somewhere, has already optioned the movie rights.

Even  with stabbings, explosions and all the murders.<br />I look forward to #3.
B0069G5Z9K|4.0|Great quick game, that you can pull out for a minute or two and put it away when need be.
1594489505|5.0|A Thousand Splendid Suns...My kudos go out to the author for writing a completely unique novel set in a place that's very little understood, nonetheless quickly vilified and scorned by the West. His writing deficiencies aside, Hosseini does a nice job framing the turmoil, violence and disfunction that have been Afghanistan for too many decades. His characters may be simple, however is that a reflection of his writing, or a mirrored image of our readers' -- comprehension regarding the Afghan culture and the events that have formed it? That we need an easy, dumbed-down way to understand or relate?<br /><br />The book was effective; by the end I was so afraid for Laila's well-being that I cringed at every page flip, the dread building as I assumed there could be no possible way for her and Tariq to make it. I suppose I am too familiar with the game of Thrones version of fate, where happiness is almost a beacon for tragedy or untimely personal loss. Throughout the novel we discover that not only can life be worse, it will be worse. Indescribably worse.

B008JFUN6E|2.0|After enjoying District 9, I was really looking forward to this movie.  Unfortunately, it pales in comparison.  This film is set 140 years into the future where the have nots, called 'Illegals' live  in cramped diseased conditions on what resembles Industrial Revolution conditions on Earth with the triage equivalent of medical treatment.  While the haves, called 'Citizens' live on Elysium, a space station orbiting Earth where they have resort style living and every 'Citizen' has a magical medical machine that cures any ailment and extends their life spans.  Matt Damon's character joins a group of rebels, lead by Spider, a heavily accented hacker, to penetrate the outer defenses of the space station in order to cure himself of radiation poisoning and make everyone a 'Citizen' so they can bring those magical medical machines back to Earth to cure the little sick children (which is the last scene of the movie).<br /><br />Unfortunately, this movie is nothing more than socialism wrapped in science fiction.  The action is great, but the story is really contrived and hits viewers over the head with it's all too familiar parallels of today's hot political issues in America like illegal immigration and government sponsored healthcare.  And if Jodie Foster's character wasn't based on Hillary Clinton, I don't know who she was supposed to resemble.  Her one line gave it away, 'I'm in charge of this station now Mr. President (who just so happens to be African American)!  Go do one of your campaign fund raisers, which is really what you're good at'.  And then both the director and Matt Damon claim with straight faces, that they weren't trying to make any political statements when creating this movie?  Yeah right! ROFLMAO! If I had known what this movie was going to really be about, I wouldn't have wasted my money and would have gone to see another movie instead.

1451627289|1.0|The details of time and place were remarkable--Stephen King at his best. The book is fast paced; I read it in 24 hours and quite enjoyed it until the plot escalated into well beyond improbable.  And then the ending basically negates the whole story with a cheap plotting trick I should have seen coming.<br /><br />Not since Hearts of Atlantis have I been so frustrated by a Stephen King novel.  I doubt I'll read another one.

B005544TRQ|5.0|Maybe a little out of reality, but a great combination of subtle humor and drama.  I really enjoy the show.
B000JO9JHW|5.0|Once you watch one, it will be tough to stop watching them. Great mix of having a per episode mystery of sorts and having a season long build-up.
B003YJEXL6|5.0|Firstly, this book is incredibly academic, reading more like a doctoral thesis in psychology than an actual book.  If that appeals to you, awesome.  If not, give it a chance anyway--it's not at all dry or boring; in fact, it's quite fascinating.<br /><br />Secondly, the book brings up and tears apart scientific &#34;research&#34; that is consistently telling us that the bi-gendered norm (the idea that there are only two genders) is scientific fact when, in fact, it isn't.  I love that she brings up that neuroscience cannot differentiate between culturally programmed gender norms and ACTUAL scientific differences between the brains of a man and a woman because the science is not that far developed, and that fact is INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT.  In the book, she refers to it as &#34;neurosexism,&#34; a term that I will probably use...well...for forever.<br /><br />For anyone who is closed minded and is looking at this book thinking &#34;what is this female supremacist piece of crap,&#34; please  do yourself a favor: ignore your initial reaction and read this book.  It breaks apart the ideas of why society has been &#34;scientifically&#34; reinforcing the macho-masculine-male and the dainty-caring-effeminate-female ideas--it's not JUST how women are being disenfranchised by the bi-gendered norm, but how males who do not fit the manly stereotype are also being downcast in the system.

If you love firefly and star trek this is for you. It's even better if you're from Massachusetts because that's where it's supposed to be. But no one has an accent!:(

B008673ZAQ|5.0|I know I will catch a lot of grief for this, but I think I liked the Crossfire series better than the 50 Shades series.  I LOVED 50 Shades, and never thought I would enjoy another series like I did that one, but the one thing I like better about the Crossfire series is the vocabulary.  I am an educated women and I do have an extensive vocabulary, however, I felt in the 50 Shades series, that  E.L. James used words that were unnecessary and at times were very distracting and cumbersome.  That is definitely not the case with this series.  The writing was fluid and the story was amazing.  It was not predictable and even managed to surprise me a couple of times.  I have read that there will be two more books to this series that is currently trilogy and I can't wait to read them!

B00DYCBH4O|5.0|Ok.  I'll admit I've read this book many times.  If I'd read the Bible as many times, I'd be a theological genius or savant or something.  I'll also admit I own the complete finished works of Jane Austen in hardback, though I seldom read her other works anymore.  I've been out of grad school for 35 years, after all.  Furthermore, I will admit I have 3 copies of P&P on my Kindle.  One of those copies is AWFUL--riddled with editorial errors attributable to digital input glitches.  The other is a bit better, but this version I had to get because it was free and it was illustrated.  If you have a Kindle Fire and if you are fairly obsessed with color, as I am, you will enjoy this particular version.  Here's why:<br /><br />(1)It is written from a publication of the work close to the author's original spelling and phrasing--not true of today's more modern English versions of the work.  Can't be having weird spellings and grammar quirks in high school and college English lit classes here.  It confuses the students, who already wonder what's so great about this British old maid writer from a couple centuries back.<br />(2)It incorporates the illustrations from not one but two different printings of P&P--illustrations done after the author was deceased, mind you, but charming and roughly contemporaneous with her period, nonetheless.<br />(3) Because it has two different sets of illustrations, it is fascinating to see the different depictions of the characters.  Interesting that the men seem to me to look similar in both sets of illustrations, and some of the minor female characters (who are not prominent in these illustrations) seem to look the same, but the principals are different.  Lizzy is dark haired in one set and golden haired in the other.  Jane is golden haired in both.  I was startled by this at first, but soon I just found it more amusing than confusing.  It doesn't take much to amuse me.<br /><br />I got this free through one of the email services which offers free or low cost Kindle e-books.  I'm keeping it and deleting the other two.  It's cool, especially if you're an Austen fan.

0761172726|3.0|This calendar is wonderful; but what's the point of ending it in December when the new one doesn't start again until July? Shouldn't it end in June? Technically, you are only using 12 months - July-June because you have to buy a new one at the end of June or be without a calendar until next July. Otherwise, this calendar is extremely cute and helpful. It organizes my entire family and everyone can see what everyone is doing a month at a glance. They should consider creating an option that starts in January as well.

B0014JKJJI|1.0|I received these on August 7, 2013. I began wearing them on August 8, 2013. On August 15, 2013, I noticed the sole detaching from the right shoe. I only wore them 5 times. I do not work in hazardous conditions. I work at a school. Here are some things that raised red flags, and make me believe these are not real Crocs:<br /><br />1) They did not arrive in a box. They arrived in a bag. No shoebox was included.<br />2) The bottom of the shoe says &#34;made in mexico.&#34; My other pair of (genuine) Crocs says &#34;made in china&#34; and the design is a bit different on the bottom.<br />3) The &#34;vents&#34; on the sides were not vents at all. They were closed. From my experience, they were open.<br /><br />The only reason I didn't send them back is because I needed new shoes for work, and I gave Amazon the benefit of the doubt because I've been a Prime customer for years. I didn't think Amazon would allow a seller to illegally sell counterfeit Crocs to a Prime member.<br /><br />I truly hope Amazon launches an investigation. I will be contacting the proper authorities to file a complaint.
0525478817|5.0|I put off reading this book (after my daughter read it cover-to-cover in less than 24 hours), thinking that a book about two teens battling cancer would be depressing.  So wrong!

B007HO392S|5.0|I've always liked Carrie Underwood's voice - and she keeps getting even better every album.  This is the strongest material from front to back I've ever heard on a single Carrie Underwood CD.<br /><br />A bit more crossover - further from traditional country than her early work.  The style suits her well.
B00656URU6|5.0|For those who are fans of Yanni's earlier work in the late 80's and early 90's, you will be surprised by this album.  It could easily have been the follow-up to Dare to Dream and In My Time.  Definitely his best work in more than a decade.  Twelve of the fifteen tracks are instrumental, which is what made us all learn to love Yanni in the first place!!
B0089EHWQE|5.0|You cannot make your way through this book without gaining a new sense if the world and your place in it.  Sadness, hope, rage, love, laughter, humiliation, contentment, despair; are the roller coaster of emotions that dominate our lives. You will experience all of these as you jouney with Will and Lou through their lives. And you will come out more empowered for having read it.

B00AALHW6Y|3.0|Unique voice I love, enjoyable melodies, polished musicianship and recording technique applied to songs I don't dislike.  Few of the songs grabbed me right away - unlike the two previous CD's (Charleston, SC 1966 and Learn to Live).<br /><br />&#34;Love Without You&#34; stands out, &#34;True Believers&#34; is quality Rucker and &#34;Miss You&#34; feels honestly sad.  &#34;Wagon Wheel&#34; is fun.<br /><br />&#34;Take Me Home&#34; leaves me feeling like I'd rather hear &#34;Southern State of Mind&#34;<br /><br />Overall the lyric writing doesn't seem as strong as previous work.

A clever story line with lots of twists and turns kept me interested from the beginning all the way through to the end. I will of course now continue on to the next \\"Angels and Demons\\".  I have found myself another favorite author that I can be sure will not disappoint. Thank you Dan Brown!!

Don't be fooled; there is a good reason they were not released.<br /><br />&#34;Remembering it all makes my flesh creep and crawl... I've seen an ear in the wall&#34;  Embarrassingly bad.<br /><br />Does not include some of my favorites from the original disks like Country Girl.

I MUCH prefer the sleep metrics provided by this sleep function over the one provided by another product I have used.  I am quite pleased with the functionality of the Pulse.  This is a great little product backed up by a very responsive account service.  Can't ask for much more.  I like the fact that you can actually see the history on the pulse itself as well as on the App.  That is a nice feature.
B00AB7HESI|5.0|You can do whatever you want with your notepad and the home page is even an open world for you to just have fun. The game was really worth the money. The only things that I didn't like was the fact that more levels cost more money , but alot but five worlds is still a lot. Also it doesn't have multiplayer but that is just my opinion.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is addictive I can't even put it down. It is definitely a must get game especially if you loved the movie
B008QE9VJI|1.0|Many of these reviews are written from the perspective of fans of the original soap (who either hate this film or enjoyed it), or people who have never seen the original soap (who either loved it or thought it was just sort of decent, but not great). I'd like to offer a third perspective. My first introduction to the world of Dan Curtis' \\"Dark Shadows\\", although began for me as a child, did not begin with the original 1967 daytime soap.  It began at the age of ten, in 1990, with Mr. Curtis' Dark Shadows Revival Series that aired as a Prime Time drama, replacing the time-slot once occupied by Twin Peaks. Although that series only lasted one season (due mostly to interruptions from network news reporting on the beginning conflicts of the Gulf War), I remember the experience well. I had a TV in my room, and even though I was strictly forbidden from watching it by my parents because it aired past my \\"bedtime\\", I would sneak watching it with the volume turned down low enough that they wouldn't hear it. That version of Dark Shadows, featuring Ben Cross as Barnabas Collins, became my \\"childhood\\" Dark Shadows memories, much in the same way the 1967 soap was for the children who \\"ran home from school\\" to see it. Instead of running home, I snuck staying up past my bedtime. That version of DS has a strong tone of gothic horror to it, and because of the updated effects and the format of being a prime time show (as opposed to a low-budget daily soap, which was filmed mere hours before being aired), it also has a strong sense of seriousness and realness to it. Upon watching the revival series, I immediately fell in love with Dark Shadows, and even though I was disappointed with the cancellation of the series, it lead me to watching the original soap (rented on VHS from Blockbuster Video, remember those days?), and the two original DS films, \\"House of Dark Shadows\\", and 'Night of Dark Shadows\\", which I also fell in love with. Because of the Revival Series (which strongly mirroredthe plot and tone of \\"House of DS\\"), I became a die-hard cult Dark Shadows fan over the years.<br /><br />Enter Tim Burton. When I found out that he was doing a \\"Dark Shadows\\" movie I was highly optimistic and excited. Then I found out it was going to be a \\"dark comedy.\\" Still I held out hope, and waited for the trailers. Then I saw said trailers, and my utter crushing disappointment hit me like a hard blow to the stomach. Still I gave the film a chance, hoping that I could look at from a different perspective. I couldn't, and I won't. You see, even though I noticed the melodramatic acting, low budget, prop failures, and slight camp when watching the original 1967 soap, I was able to tune out those things. I simply didn't see them. Because my intro to the world of DS began with the 1990 series, I saw the \\"camp\\"  of the original series as a product of the show's format; a product of being a daytime show in the 60s, with an almost non-existant budget, and extremely short daily shooting schedule. For me it wasn't about it being a \\"soap\\", because I knew the story Dark Shadows was trying to tell. I knew that story was a gothic horror story, much in the same vein as Stoker's \\"Dracula\\", or Shelley's \\"Frankenstein\\", or the \\"Picture of Dorian Gray\\", or Hawthorn's \\"The House of the Seven Gables.\\" I knew the story was intended to be taken seriously, despite the flaws of its format. To me, it seemed like Mr. Curtis always wanted Dark Shadows to be more like the 1990 series and his two films, House and Night. That was when I feel Mr. Curtis was in his element (look at his \\"Trilogy of Terror\\" films for instance). I feel that Curtis was always held back from presenting DS the way he meant it to be when it was restricted by that daily soap format, and that his short-lived 1990 series and two films was how he really wanted to tell the story.<br /><br />That is why I find Burton's lighthearted attempt at poking fun at the original series in his film (even if he intended to do so in arespectful way), to be so insulting. I just can't see Dan Curtis (if he were alive) approving of this comedic version. I know this just from watching Mr. Curtis' films, which are pure straight-up classic horror in the tradition of the Hammer Horror films of old. I don't know why Burton just can't do a straight-up horror film (the closest we've gotten yet, and in my opinion, his last good film, was \\"Sleepy Hollow\\"). He could have made this a great film and a great addition to the Dark Shadows legacy. He missed the mark completely. Perhaps Mr. Burton should stick to what he is best at: art direction, and films like his \\"The Nightmare Before Christmas\\" and \\"Frankenweenie.\\" Leave the serious gothic horror stories to the pros, Mr. Burton!<br /><br />Bottom line: if you are a fan of the gothic horror element of the original series, a fan of the 1990 revival series, or the two original films (House & Night), you are probably going to hate this movie with a passion. If you are a fan of serious treatments of literary gothic horror, like Coppola's \\"Bram Stoker's Dracula\\", or Anne Rice's \\"Interview with the Vampire\\", or stories like Mary Shelley's Frankenstein, you will also probably dislike this film. If you however are a fan of Tim Burton and Johnny Depp's typical (and at this point, painfully predictable) quirky lighthearted approach to the macabre, then you may like this film. In either case, I invite you to seek out and watch the true Dark Shadows, both the original and revival series, and the two original series films.
B00821OX98|5.0|Well developed characters are a must for a TV series & this show delivers plus spinning a terrific syfy story as well.
B00AO2P3GA|5.0|This game is awesome. It is the quality of a console game, a very fun campaign with a good story and a very good multiplayer. If you are thinking that this might not be worth the money you are wrong. I believe that it is the equivalent of some sixty dollar games but for android. This game is only a dollar and is totally worth it.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Great actors and good story.  There wsn't any profanety or sexual scenes and that was very refreshing.  Masterpiece did a great job.
B000002MP2|5.0|I guess the edgy kids think it's cool to hate on green day. Best album of the 90's, or maybe tied with Nevermind.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Quick access to several Bible translations make research easy for all believers and seekers. Just wish it has the NRSV.
B00DYOOGYK|4.0|It was a very fun game  and developed a great story. The only problem was there were too many side quests and no multiplayer. Also. Can't use gyroscope to aim. Actually you really can't even aim, you just click on a target and it locks on to them, I think that really made the gameplay not as fun
B006MW3V6U|5.0|This was as good as the first one.  This is an all consuming series which builds each season.  Wonderfully told story.
B004SCN2F6|5.0|I love this game!!! it is real fun I feel like han solo button rapeing the empire.  Luke I am your father....  Noooo I don't have a father noooo......
0385349947|5.0|I am retired now but I wanted this book for our college bound Grandaughter. I sat down and read it as soon as it arrived and could not put it down. I wish I would have had this when I went into the work force. I feel it is an excellent book for any woman.
0307279189|5.0|Wonderfully written! Who would have thought this topic could keep you on the edge of your seat? But it did. Loved hearing about the history and the region and the other quirky characters that inhabit the area. Great read.
B00E8B1P9M|4.0|It was a good movie, I really enjoyed it. Glad Amazon had it so I could rent it because I do not go to the movies.
B0028R3NCU|5.0|I keep one of these loaded with a 32 GB in my pocket, attached to my key chain at all times. It's one of those things that's invaluable when you just need to pass a few files around easily. No cap to get lose, and the lanyard is perfect for the key ring so it never gets lose. Can swap in more capacity easily when needed. Always recognized by any PC I've tried it in.
0894803123|4.0|I already wrote a review on this book, it contained what I had hoped it would and just what I expected. Shipping was adequate and as expected.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|I no sooner finished this book then wanted to read it all over again. What a jewel! Definitely five stars.
6304500831|1.0|The sound quality of the VHS was terrible and I had to consistantly auto-track throughout the entire movie. Every ten seconds it was a new problem.
B0046B3QTG|5.0|I don't want to write too much, because the things I love about the movie will give it away. I'll suffice it to say, it's entertaining, funny, and a feel-good story. Enjoy!
B0023SDPS6|5.0|Better than series  on TV as you get more insight into character. Very funny at times and good reading. Recommend this book  to everyone.
B006Y5EDRG|4.0|At times this season got a little depressing because everyone's relationship tanked, but the great music made up for it.
B0007KIFGE|4.0|Under-rated film.  Its not Apocalypse Now but it delivers.  The action is non-stop and there is a decent story line as well.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|After the 6-7th time of downloading I finally got it to work on my Kindle Fire, been playing on my phone, but this is way more manageable and superbly fun! Don't give up on the downloaded, it's well worth it.
B008K6HN8I|5.0|I would definitely recommend this app in your kindle fire hd. It's a great file explorer. Good thing is, it's totally free!
B0079R8KO0|4.0|ITS VERY NICE.  IT DOES EVERYTHING I WANTED IT TO DO AND IT WAS A GREAT PRICE.  i AM HAPPY WITH IT.
B000JMKTLO|5.0|Well written, full story with developed characters.  Almost seems too well written to be fiction. Another great piece of fiction from GF.
B00DH1G7DS|4.0|I have always played forms of this game on paper but I am enjoying this new venue. Thanks for offering it!:D
B003YL4LYI|5.0|For those of you disappointed with Feast of Crows, Dance with Dragons is the payoff. No spoilers here. Great overall series. Highly recommend seeing this one through. Type away Mr. Martin; can't wait to see what's next!
B008XG1X18|5.0|It is a great app to share interest, to learn about history, art, cultivating gardens, and education. Way to go Pinterest!
0763655465|5.0|Cute, funny, great illustrations but my favorite thing is that my 2.5 year old daughter knows this book by heart and yells \\"Oh no, George!\\" whenever George gets into trouble - we love reading this book together!  She also loves Little Lost Owl too.
B000O8OTNC|3.0|Shipping was extremely fast.<br /><br />The sharpener works okay. It won't take the place of my regulare sharpening sticks,but it is better then having nothing at all while your in the field. I used it on my micro Swiss army pocket knife and I really didn't notice a difference in how sharp it was. This product would make a good stocking stuffer or a good gift for the guy who has everything.<br /><br />I would recommend it to a friend/family member for their tackle box or their bugout bag.
B000FCKGPC|3.0|Where are all the characters (that are still alive) that we know and love? This is a tough one to get through.
B008C20TDG|5.0|Great book, by wonderful people who have touched so many lives with their research, development, and ingenuity. I would definitely recommend this book to anyone who wants to improve their health and well-being.
B0006IUDXA|5.0|cant say enough about this one. how he makes something out of nothing , its amazing . any fan of his would love this.
B00B2G2RG6|5.0|Kevin Bacon and a great supporting cast make this less of a far fetched idea that it probably looked on paper. Makes for good binge viewing.
B00846REIS|5.0|50 Shades only more mellow!  Stronger female character.  Twisted plot, interesting read.  I hope you enjoy this series as much as I did.
B00DBSZEH2|4.0|I was a little disappointed in this movie.  It had a lot of potential and if it's on TV I'd watch it again but I definitely will not buy the DVD.
0547258305|5.0|Ohmigosh Graceling! I can like rant forever! So I first read this book for the CYRM in like 2012. It was a young adult nominee going against Beastly by Alex Flinn and If I Stay by Gayle ______ (I forgot her name). So as you can see, those were pretty famous and out there books.<br /><br />This one is another one of those 'It's so good, I have to buy it!' ones. If you can't tell already, I did end up choosing Graceling out of the three. I know Graceling did win school-wide, but in the whole California, I'm not sure. Hold up, let me search it up first, lol.<br /><br />Graceling did win! :) So it has the Cali Young Reader Medal. Those books (nominees) are actually really great books. I'll miss it so much. Too bad it's only for middle school kids.<br /><br />Either way, back to Graceling. The romance was good, but it didn't necessarily jump out at me. It was the plot. Like I loved the plot so much! I really really love medieval settings! Cuz they are so perf! &#60;333<br /><br />Well, once again, YA romance adventure lovers, THIS ONE IS GREAT. AND IT'S BECOMING A MOVIE IN 2014 SO READ IT BEFORE THE MOVIE COMES OUT! :D
B00CLT31D6|5.0|I would recommend this book among some others I have read to anyone willing to hear me out! BTW also read: 'Why Smart People Make Big Money Mistakes and How to Correct Them: Lessons from the Life-Changing Science of Behavioral Economics' Another amazing read.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|These novels were Fifty Shades of Grey only calmer.  I read the trilogy and found to be much less predictable then 50 shades with a much stronger main character!
B00COHIFQS|5.0|I absolutely love horror movies but the story lines are usually lacking.  Mama combines scary with a heart warming story that most can relate with.  Definitely worth watching at least once.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I'm looking forward to future updates, which will hopefully come soon! In 3-4 updates will be In-game-music. It will be more and more like the computer version according to the creator.
1878424319|4.0|Wasn't keen on the 'black magic' descriptions. So that's it so it is. Is that ok with you. That's me-bye, bye.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I like this solitaire app a hole lot. it is amazingly amazing! :-) it is gr8 for multiplayer or just playing by itself.
0143124544|1.0|This book was amazing..until the end. Even with the challenging subject, the I found myself laughing and hopeful and falling in love with the characters.  Then, the whole book story to go into a deep, dark place and it never came out.  Sad, especially when it was likely going to be one of my all-time favorites and had chosen it for our book club for next month.  However, I don't want any of my friends going through this emotional journey of the lives of Lou and Will only to finish feeling depressed and let-down.  What a disappointment :(
B001KOFH2G|5.0|I love this movie! So glad to find it to have as a part of our collection. It does a great job of tying together the firefly series. Well done!
B009F89EW8|5.0|He is just simply amazing. I love his lyrics and the music but I really love his singing and his accent.
B00009NQQO|5.0|for all future athletes and just plain fun. 1 year luvs any kind of ball playtime. it is a great bath toy
B000NVIXDW|5.0|Love Michael Buble's voice.  Could listen to him endlessly.  Would buy his records any time and introduce others to him as well.
159463176X|3.0|Hosseini has a clear flowing writing style.  But this book does not reach the depth of the Kite Runner.  Too many and too much on minor characters who really don't mean much to the storyline
B006O5YHUY|5.0|Good direction, good story, Nick Nolte is amazing but Tom Hardy is the reason to watch this film. His transformation is fantastic.
B004XUMMFE|5.0|and again. so worth it. new to it, heard alot and sooo glad to finally watch it. all the family is hooked!
B00ECUARO8|5.0|Not a typical McConaughey movie. This movie grabs your interest and curiosty from the beginning and never let's go. McConaughey was great, but the kid, Tye Sheridan, was fantastic. Great movie and I certainly recommend watching it.
B000JZ45LQ|5.0|Then this is a must see.  She is the ultimate DIVA.  Concert includes lots of history about her career and she made it big.
1781163243|5.0|I know that what is represented in this book, is only a small fraction of what was done to bring Halo-4 to life. I work in entertainment & know that literally thousands of images are produced to create a world as complex and rich as the ones in Halo. Sparth has become a well known name among fans of concept art & his work is simply inspiring. Another standout among many in this book is John Liberto... the epic scale & scope of his paintings is awe inspiring. I'm very happy with this book!
B00DHSK3RM|1.0|i wanted to play the actual game not find a tutorial and tons of imitation games in the store :-(
B002ZG97EC|5.0|If you do not assemble the minions, Vector will find you!  Awesome movie, and my kid loves it!<br /><br />Can't wait for Despicable Me 2 to come out on video.
B0080SZ0V8|5.0|This is an excellent game.  Each section provides you with challenging puzzles to solve.  I like the variety that each section offers and look forward to advancing into the next level.  Once you start, it is hard to stop playing.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Great drama that fits my perceptions of what life for the wealthy and titled English was like in the early 20th century.
B0099RFVXQ|4.0|The second half of the film is a lot better than the first half.  The jokes and camaraderie seemed less forced towards the end - one tires of Robert Downey jr's ego
0780622545|4.0|It's been a while since I watched this, but it left a good impression. I mostly remember the acting being decent.
B008K8VDPU|2.0|The free version is very limited.  I was hoping for more variety.  I didn't want to buy the game, so I deleted the free version.
B0091REZMW|2.0|I love hidden object games but I have a hard time seeing small objects. It would be nice if we had the option to enlarge the screen.
B0094BB4TW|2.0|Format for posting text and photos changes without warning and not for the better.  Ability to look at posting data also changes, creating additional difficulties.  If I had to pay a single penny for Facebook, I would drop it.
B00006AULI|4.0|It's been a while since I watched this, but it left a good impression. It has a great chilling atmosphere.
B004EPYZPI|5.0|First, I enjoyed Michael McConaughey in a more serious character role.  He's funny in a comedic part, but he is well suited to playing the role of a street wise defense attorney.  He's like a 'worm protector' who is good at what he does and ensures he gets a fat check.  Usually attorneys are government wise.  The casting is good.  The story is great and you need to follow it from the start.  Justice is in the eye of the beholder so, stick with the movie till the end.  It's the drama and your own investigative thoughts that keep the suspense alive.
B003K1EYM6|5.0|finally i got it<br /><br />great shape , qualitiy , and work well with my ipad<br /><br />just whish it for iphone
B0006GANOQ|4.0|Almost time for its 20th Anniversary but still moving along. This is the first time I have seen the movie and was happy to find that age has not stunted its entertainment value. There are other bus sagas, but this one tries to match the many 'train out of control' films; only in this case, it is a necessity to keep it moving above a certain speed or it will explode.  There were a few incidents when the LA police are seen falling for tricks that were old when Dennis Hopper (then the oldest of the stars) was born. I suppose the writers can be forgiven since these were probably required to prepare the way for later scenes. At any rate, there is plenty of action, starred actors played their roles well (with Dennis Hopper, no doubt, encouraged to do his Mad Scientist bit of rug chewing) and the supporting cast did so, too.<br />While not in the category of best in its class, it is good and lively viewing for any action fan.
6303430570|3.0|The first time I saw this, I hated it. However, on repeat viewings with friends, I've come to see the appeal. Plus it's the source of quite a few memes.
1574216988|5.0|This book is an excellent resource for Zentangle techniques, and demonstrates a variety of different applications for using Zentangle designs.
B00CH3QLG0|5.0|Definitely the best album of the year hands down.  Came fast and in great condition. Sounds incredible. You won't regret this purchase
B000H5TVJY|5.0|Excellent mix of gore, thriller and sexuality... Good story, complex, disturbing. Christian Bale brilliant as Patrick Bateman one of the greatest, and handsome, psychopath on movies.
1556347308|5.0|This is an amazing improvement over 3rd Edition; they simplied many over-complicated aspects and definitely updated the design inside the book. Every time I see this on my shelf, I want to play!
0786860707|5.0|This is a wonderful book that focuses on Disney animation techniques and it will be very helpful in the graphics classroom.
B00338QENI|3.0|Full of interesting information about how far (and not far) scientific research has come over the years, and a perfect example of the hypocrisy of researchers claiming to be doing their work for the good of mankind.
B005CRQ2DK|5.0|This is the best book I have ever read and it is appropriate  and it is a very funny and good book.
B000T00PE2|4.0|I purchase few complete CD's but this was one that I had to get. Most of the songs are really good and I love the smooth sound. I'm glad I've been introduced to trip hop.
0571202284|5.0|This book gives a wonderful outline of step-by-step animation drawings. My only regret is not getting the version of this book that also contains a CD, this would have been helpful to use in the classrom when demonstrating animated sequences.
B003X2O6KW|5.0|Simply one of those most perfectly sound albums that has come to surface, this is probably one of my favorite albums of all time, Kanye produced this album when he retreated to Hawaii and just went crazy on the production and all bunched up with the amount of amazing musicians and singers and rappers alike with it, this album is simply perfect and one of his best albums to date. A must get album for any hip hop head.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|Great descriptive writing. Great characters and outstanding dialogue. Even if you have watched the HBO series, it is worth reading because it gives you much more depth into the story.
0345525558|3.0|I chose this book because a friend recommended it. I haven't had a chance to read it yet, though. I am looking forward to reading it.
B009ZQ8FQG|3.0|The close knit story lines are replaced with broad strokes that don't create the same depth. Still worth watching just not as enthralling as the previous seasons
B007YJS7G4|1.0|Since Hollywood was established around 100 years ago there have been numerous war films made. Some good, some bad. Red Tails has to be quite possibly the worst ever made. This movie was budgeted at $58 million yet how this movie made the $49 million it did to me is a mystery.  Had George Lucas not come to this films rescue I think it would have done even worse!<br />Many claim that the Tuskeegee Airmen really made no great impact in WW2 at all due to how Germay's top fighter aces had been either killed or captured in prior years.  Yet I am white and I agree regardless of skin color these men were still soldiers nonetheless and deserve their place in history.  Yet with that being said this film did these brave men no justice whatsoever!  It had several scenes that were historically innacurate if not plain corny!  The high remarks listed here at Amazon to me leave me scratching my head as to how they would even get any high remarks at all!<br />Bottom line, this film is a rusted out resounding clunker!  Dont waste your time with it.<br /><br />***Update 1/29/14***<br />Just out of curiosty a few days ago I asked a friend of mine (who's dad is full blooded Italian) if hypothetically speaking had black aviator back in WW2 had fallen for an Italian girl would her parents approve.  I also told him about this movie.  His response (and I'm quoting) \\"hell NO, her parents would not!\\"  He went on to say \\"first of all the girl would have known better!\\"  He told me there are some interracial relationships nowadays in Italy but not many. He added in WW2 that was a totally different time and no way would such a union like that be approved of. Again, these are HIS words not mine!<br />This casts another shade of silliness to the historical accuracy of this corny movie.  And no I'm not saying, implying or alluding in any way that interracial relationships are not a good thing but if you make a historical movie how about focusing a bit more on accuracy!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I'm kind of late to the Hunger Games party, but I'm glad I decided to check it out. I saw the movie in theaters and enjoyed the story and thought it was well made. That said, there's a lot of detail and perspective that the movie couldn't possibly capture that you get from the book. Definitely worth the read, even if you've already seen the movie!
B002JWD6AS|5.0|I love Maggie stiefvater she writes about love with twists and I've noticed her characters are kind of the same the book: this girl,Grace , was attacked by wolves that shift to humans in warm temperature and one wolf,Sam ,saves her they then have to fight against fate to save Sam's human life
B009OYTAL8|5.0|A little slow and low budget for the first few episodes, but keep watching because it only gets better.  Great twists in plot and characters not to mention the developement of the Green Arrow character played by Stephen Amell.  Not sure how he jumps the bar from one level to another in mid air when working out, but it is sure nice to watch :)  Looking forward to season two in September.
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|This is one of my favorites by Neil Galiman! I never want the stories to end. He creates wonderful new worlds with twists you don't expect with an adult twist. This one is no exception.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This is the fastest I've ever breezed through a book. I didn't read the series before the movie started and knowing what happens kept me from being as interested and intrigued with the first book as I was with this one. When I heard the concept I was afraid it would be redundant, but it's very well done. Definitely worth the read!
B00DS8YQWE|4.0|E.M. Forster's \\"A Passage To India\\" (1924) is itself a bit like the culture of colonial India which Forster describes: defying western understanding, maddeningly inconsistent, but mesmerizing nonetheless. This is the type of novel I suspect may offer greater rewards in subsequent readings, when one already has an appreciation for its overall intent.<br /><br />Penguin has done an admirable job with this edition. Aside from the novel itself, there is a passable introduction that offers some info about the author's experiences and lends insight into the whys and hows of the novel's creation, as well as some critical thoughts on the text itself. Not bad but I've seen better. A separate intro and author's note, both to a previous edition, are also included as appendices to be read at your discretion. The explanatory notes and glossary at the back are necessary and welcome additions as well.<br /><br />Good binding, clear and readable text, and all wrapped in a handsome black cover makes this edition a fine addition to any collection of classics.<br /><br />Fine Reading!
B008RA3X5E|4.0|It's a piece of mind knowing I sit the alarm and its go off at the correct time., getting to work one<br />Time USA must
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Never have I been so captured by a story and the idea of it ending so many different ways. This series will draw you in and not let go until you've turned the last page, longing for more. Truly a classic and worth every sleepless night you spend reading it. \\"Happy Hunger Games! And may the odds be ever in your favor!\\"
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|This book will make a great movie (or movies, if they follow the current trend and split it). There's more action, which for me personally doesn't translate well for reading but will be great to see played out. I'm not a huge fan of the ending, but the series was so great I can't complain too much.
B00DRPVE3M|1.0|Would be fun but the app doesn't work. I've tried reinstalling it, but every time I try to open it, it starts to load then exits.
B009SQWQ5E|1.0|like the another review above mine, this is a huge deception, I don't know why amazon offer dvd / blu rays that we cannot play in Canada or US. do not buy it because you will end up returning the video and wasting your time.
1401937268|5.0|The deck is quite beautiful and actually answered several questions on the first try. I enjoy using them for certain questions.
B0060MYM7O|5.0|Seriously, just ask a friend or coworker. This show is amazing. Watch it. This review requires seven more words than what I typed, so I'll go ahead and say that &#34;The book was better&#34; is a statement you won't hear. The show is just as good as the books, if you ask me.
1250004217|5.0|The characters were well developed and the plot very different.  My daughter recommended it and I agree with her.  It is a very well written book.  I would recommend it highly.  Waiting to see the movie.
B0099Y2MYK|3.0|I simply loved season 1. And 2. I could hardly wait. For season 3 and boy have I been disappointed. This show was refreshing and interesting the writers seemed to keep the show moving yet stay within the historic accuracy of the times. Sybil's death in childbirth was totally believable for the time, and lavinia's death from spanish flu also believable but Mathew's death from a. Motor vehicle accident on the very day that his first child was born. Was simply over the top and not even believable, to the ridiculous. I do not want to watch the news being broke or the grief......I think I will rewatch seasons 1 and 2 and dream of another beter ending. Three stars because I did love. Season 1 and 2 but Sadly season 3 imploded
B005K17RU0|4.0|My only issue is the city selection once you have entered an area, you can't delete it.<br />The local city isn't the default.
030758836X|5.0|I thought that this book was very well written, and clever. I kept wondering what the spin would be, how it would end, and I could not put it down once I got to Part two. Once I got to the ending, I came to terms with it, and felt that it was a fine ending, until I got to thinking about it and then realized, it didn't make much sense. Either way, I was really in to this book and enjoyed it.
B002NT3B52|2.0|The best way I can describe this book is that it is like a well researched college essay filled with fluff. I was so disappointed by this book I couldn't even finish it. I give it two stars because it wasn't horrible, just bad. Don't know how this book got so popular.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|It's like owning a real horse without having to pay money for its food and accessories! I love how it comes to me and I can take pictures of her!
B008IJT0CE|5.0|I like the sounds and melodies they are nice in the background when I do not want to listen to music or the radio.
B00C7DGQ9C|4.0|Bloody wonderful! A great popcorn flick and is loaded with dark humor. Defiantly worth a buy. Rent it firs then buy it
B009UX2YAC|5.0|this game is amazing its really addicting I can never put my kindle fire down I'm always playing subway surfer
B008JJM88Q|3.0|The app was OK for the Free App of the Day.  Otherwise I would not have bought it.  Initially it is a fun app but the enjoyment ends quick.
B001AZFO14|5.0|This film is one of Kurt Russell's best!  I have watched this movie about 5 times and still enjoy it.
B003WE9TU8|5.0|I really enjoyed this read. I like reading sci fi and i think this book fits perfectly in the genre. It was a great book to read while commuting on the train as each chapter starts with a different character's perspective. The delivery and perspective was original and it kept a good pace so i was always excited to return to it. The emphasis is on characters' experiences and view points through different periods of time during the start of the epidemic and the following war. It is completely different from the movie but i don't think they are mutually exclusive, i really enjoyed them both independently.
B00571F26Y|5.0|I was told about this book a year ago and finally got an opportunity to read it. It has completely changed how I eat. I am totally Gluten Free now and it has almost completely eliminated my painful osteo arthritis in my hands, neck, back and feet. I am a Crohn's sufferer and never realized that my inflammation could be related to wheat consumption and WHY the new wheat is different from the wheat of 50 years ago. I have been to several Dr's trying to get some relief from my pain, but I felt relief within 3 days of total elimination of the offending products. My advice to anyone who has inflammation issues to read this book and try it for themselves.I'm a new believer!
B007FIY3VW|5.0|No matter where I am, I have use of the services.  It doesn't limit me to the use of services
B00B04KVMC|5.0|listening to the performances of the material along with the super playing of each musician bring all the elements together in one package, sound city 606.
B008CLI4N4|5.0|Even though it was not HD, I loved it.  Wonderful stories.  Can't wait for Season 4 to be released!  Recommend it.
B00DQVSTCG|5.0|Madonna described the tour as \\"the journey of a soul from darkness to light\\". It was divided into four sections: Transgression, where guns and violence was the main theme, Prophecy, where a mix of joyful songs that bring people together are performed, Masculine/Feminine, a combination of sensuality and fashion with a few of Madonna's classic songs performed in a French Cabaret-style, and Redemption, which Madonna labeled as \\"a big party and celebration\\". The tour has received positive reception and critical acclaim.<br />The tour courted many controversial subjects such as violence, firearms, human rights, nudity and politics. Lawsuits threatened against Madonna have also been engaged from the tour. The MDNA Tour created immense success at the box office and many venues were instantly sold out. It was dubbed as the highest-grossing tour of 2012 by Billboard. The tour grossed $305.2 million from 88 sold-out shows, becoming the tenth highest-grossing tour of all time THE CONCERT WAS GREAT, AND THE QUEEN MORE THAN AMAZING, THAT IS CALLED CONCERT!!!!

B0063IH60K|5.0|I have this solitaire on my iPad and my Galaxy 4 phone, it is a great game from this app.
B008N2Z1M4|5.0|the songs are well structured and the playing is striking.  This is a combination package which consist of a vinyl recording and cd, well worth it.
B000FCKC4C|5.0|It´s a book that make you think. I would recommend to everybody. I hope you enjoy the book as well
B00CO52NLI|5.0|Grfaphics are amazing and plenty to do.  Enjoy playing this game, you can care for all sorts of animals and does give you good facts about the animals you are caring for.
B003D81NVQ|5.0|This show is fantastic! It's got a great cast and acting, with a great script. Keeps you on the edge of your seat every episode!
B00847KFDS|5.0|a legendary rock and country guitarist recorded past hits along with other artists.  The sound of the recording studio really stands out on this cd as well as the great musicianship and song writing, one of a kind.
B007TVANDM|1.0|My son loves Pete the Cat.  However, I was very disappointed by the Kindle version.  More than half of the words were so small (even after zooming in) that my son had a difficult time differentiating the letters.  I guess we'll stick with the real books, and consider this an $8 lesson to preview first.
B004W25KKW|5.0|From this book I have learnt methods I was able to use from day one to improve my memory and thus improve my life. I have learnt methods to remember names, places, to do lists using such methods as the memory palace.  One interesting point stood out to me from this book was life is just the combination of the memories we remember and when we forget a memory, we almost lose a part of our life or who we are, it can be as if that event had never had existed or that year was wiped from our life.<br /><br />There is no such thing as a bad memory, only an untrained one if only I had read this book at school, collage or anytime before now remembering would be as easy as walking down my street. Highly recommended
B005CKPQ7A|5.0|Love the cast this season and the story line really picks up! All around this is just a great show.
B005HSL626|2.0|This really just wasn't for me. A fun game, but as I said, not really for me. Maybe for someone in their teens.
B00BTHWFBK|5.0|This is a great album for the true Sabbath fans! From start to finish it's classic Sabbath! All the songs are in true Sabbath form (time changes, riffs, subject matter) this album can easily go into the top 5. If all the guys were to quit today this would be a good send off! The only thing it is missing is Bill Ward. The deluxe version is definitely worth buying for the 3 extra songs! It sounds like old meets new Black Sabbath! It picks up where Vol. 4 left off. I can't say enough good things about this! As a huge Sabbath fan this is the best I've heard since Sabotage.
B00EH49DXA|5.0|I love this song!!!! katy perry did it again with another feel good song, empowering and totally fun!!!! I only heard it a couple of times and I already memorized it its so catchy!!!!!
B005544TRQ|4.0|Suits is witty and fun to watch. Lewis is so goofy it's hard to take him serious. each character is pretty interesting.
0345803507|5.0|This was a fantastic book! I had to read it because of all the hype and it was worth it!!!
B000GWE44U|5.0|Excellent and deeply disturbing film about a family isolated in an enormous empty hotel in the middle of nowhere. If this run-on sentence does not inspire you, then there's probably somebody else who wrote a better review of it. All I can say is: watch it!
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|This game is fun with perserverance. If you expect to get far in a short time - you'll be disappointed. Energy is restored a little faster than other similar games. Having fun with this game by returning everyday - using only the energy given for free.
B0047Y0FGY|2.0|THIS BOOK WAS NOT AS FUN TO READ AS I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE. TINA FEY IS ONE OF MY FAVORITE COMEDIANS BUT THIS BOOK HONESTLY JUST DID NOTHING FOR ME.
0345803493|5.0|This was a fantastic book! I had to read it because of all the hype and it was worth it!!!
B00BC24NT4|2.0|Was not the page turner I expected - dragged in parts and di not hold my interest - in short disappointed after high expectations
B004KRQFI0|5.0|one of my favorite types of music. been looking for this then found it on here. very happy with cd
B0063M22QO|5.0|Great starter...Enjoy being able to repeat the play over and over again. My grandkids like to play this as well.
0345803485|5.0|This was a fantastic book! I had to read it because of all the hype and it was worth it!!!
B008EEZ64Y|5.0|This book was very interesting . As I read the story , I imagined our time as id it were \\" Sameness \\" . I imagined the past .... being a colorless shade of gray . I
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Awesome game it surprise me so much that this game was free!!! Can't beat minion rush it is i think better than temple run
B00DHSK3RM|5.0|would recommend this game to all my friends<br />easy to play<br />easy to understand<br />does not tqke forever to play the game
B008MEM24S|4.0|It's a fun game, just really wasn't for me. I would say that for kids from 6-16 would have fun with this.
B00DJFIMW6|1.0|The game did not work past the beginning sequence... it kept saying loading but nothing happened. tried to uninstall and start over and that did not work either
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|Fun game can't stop playing! Lose all track of time when I'm playing. Great for those long car trips, really makes the time fly by.
B003NVMWBS|4.0|Although critics may say that this film doesn't depict divorce in a realistic way, there is no denying the command performances given by each of the actors. More than a tale of divorce, it is the story of one mother passing the batton, so to speak.
B00A77II0U|5.0|This is a great game, the graphics are great and the story line was amazing and fun to play with! Really worth every penny!!
B005ES0Z9O|5.0|My husband loves this shoe. He has two pairs and is considering more. It's a perfect fit for him and he loves the space his foot has with the width.
B00BV1OT0O|3.0|Typical vinyl display. It's funny and cute to have. Was pretty affordable of good value but shipping was a disappoint. Happy to receive it on time but boxes came damage.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is the best game I have ever played! I love the minions. They are so funny:) I hope they have more games like this one.
B004W2UBYW|5.0|Steve Jobs was a brilliant, complicated person, and Issacson does a great job letting us get to know him. As I read this book on my IPad, I came to admire him. I only started liking Apple when I bought my IPod, and that was not long ago. I now understand how you could become so devoted to Apple
0375869026|5.0|Great writing and gives one a lot to think about re: people who are different than we are and how they feel. Compelling.
B00CL68QVQ|4.0|It is an absolute must to read the book first! I won't allow otherwise.... LOL :) . The book was awesome! I was kind of disappointed within the first five minutes of the movie because right away it was nothing like the book. But I love a good story and I have to say I still enjoyed their spin on the book. You don't get the sense of what goes on in the characters mind like you do with the book but they still did a charming job of Pat and his family/friends and his journey to his 'silver lining'.
B007SYWFRM|3.0|My son loved this game spent 9 months &amp; got up to level 50 something one d as y the game updated &amp; the whole thing crashed!  Back to the beginning &amp;  a heart broke 4 year old
B00ECUARO8|3.0|I do recommend this movie, it has a good story to it. It's a love story but not too girly.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|This book is written for everyone.  If your a gun guy or a gun guys wife.  We both loved the book, not a lot of talk over your head if you don't know guns well.  Gives an idea of what some of the stuff took place.  There are some very funny parts to this book also.  Chris wrote this book as if you are sitting across the table at a bar and he is telling you his story.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I simply love this app as an artist  seamstress and crafter it gives me such a great way to inspire myself &amp; to do even better at my projects I'm simply amazed at all the gorgeous works of art on here..if you haven't tried it I suggest doing it now..the pictures even link to the web page or sites(the source of subject or item at hand)
B004APVI1G|5.0|I have LG cinema 3d TV this movie rocks! Im not to interested in commentaries and other stuff on most dvds. I love this movie! Great color, sharpness, 3d is great ! The roadrunner 3d cartoon was a definite plus, it was great too. A must have if you aren't interested in extras. The movie content is Great I enjoyed it.
B0013TXA5Y|4.0|It's always fun to read something new with the same myths and creatures. I like this author's writing and the female character is not too annoying.
B005OYKI1I|5.0|Very good movie, as always. This is better than the last few, Paul Walker is good but him and Vin Diesel together are much better.
1452126577|3.0|I love following Grumpy Cat's many quotes and photos and thought this book would be a nice addition to have.  Wasn't quite what i expected, but the price is fair and it's an okay book.
B00992CF6W|5.0|it hard to explain how fun this game is so umm im gonna say this realy is fun to play
B00DRPVE3M|2.0|The game itself is fine, but you have to always buy tokens in order to play - I'll stick with playing the old-fashioned way.
1447231171|4.0|could not put this new issue of the this saga down - I wish Mr. Archer would write as quick as we read his work!<br />Katrina
B008EKMB82|5.0|Wow, loved this book! Hard to describe, but it weaves narrative, history, philosophy, and even quantum physics (what?!?!) into a really poignant and beautiful experience. The characters and their worlds sucked me in & I wasn't ready for it to end.
B003SHUMRI|5.0|The choreography in the final dance routine was beautifully in sync with the music, which in itself was a great piece. Channing had the greatest challenge in adapting his style to the traditional dance routines and he accomplished it well. I would have enjoyed being in the audience to watch the entire routine play out across the stage.
B00821PCJS|5.0|For whatever reason I always resisted watching this on TV (Noah Wiley will always be ER to me I guess, and I wasn't ready to see him on a different show). But this summer I watched Season 1 on Amazon Prime and got sucked right in. I'm just about to finish Season 2, and now I have to wait for Season 3 to hit the &#34;free&#34; level on Prime - but if you're a sci-fi fan with an &#34;End of the World as We Know It&#34; twist, I'd highly recommend Falling Skies.
B00BRUQ7ZY|4.0|My primary niggling difference with the author is his complete acceptance of the existence of Nazareth at that time. One reference outside the Bible in the 2nd Century and no Roman records until the 3rd Century makes that a stretch for me. I lean toward the connection being with one who took the Nazarite vows. That;s just me but otherwise a highly recommended read.
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|Great graphics & challenging puzzles. Music is authentic but annoying.<br />Disappointed that it doesn't follow screen rotation though as sometimes want to change positions for comfort.
B003O86FMW|4.0|Enjoyed the storyline and writing style. Kept me intrigued and read the whole series in a week. It was hard to put down.
B00D41AJ7G|5.0|I initially got this app because it was free, but it is amazing!  It is challenging, but manageable.  It's a great game for anyone who wants a stimulating and higher order thinking game.  The only downfall is that once you figure out the pattern for a particular ball, it's easy to duplicate and remember the steps.  This is not the type of game you can play routinely...unless they introduce more boxes/levels.
B000021Y77|5.0|this movie was great just as I remembered it, even better since it was dubbed in English. not that I mind subtitles but the better half doesn't . arrived quickly tracking worked well for a change
B000AJIF4E|5.0|I've been addicted to the bright signature that these headphones provide for the last few years.  I bought a second set for home use, and I'm very happy with how they sound, which is nearly identical to my well-traveled 3 year old MDR-V6s.  In contrast to the V6 model, the 7506 uses a Neodymium magnet, different grounds for the drivers, and has a gold plug.  I can't recommend these enough.
B00D3XAA4M|5.0|I think this book does a good job of mixing very traditional tourist sites with more exotic ones. It features accurate reporting and offers. Up some wonderful continental experiences.
B008VBYN80|1.0|As others have said, this game has potential, but it is not a free game if you actually want to play it.  You can do a minimum of actions and then have to put it away or pay money.  This type of bait and switch gets boring very quickly and leads to removal of the game and moving on to others that are more honest in their offering.
B0019GO54G|5.0|For me, this movie is a classic.  It's not Richard Gere's best work but for its time, it's an interesting story of an upscale male prostitute.
B000NGTJTY|5.0|I mean, look at the cast. This is a great film with great actors. Scorsese can do no wrong in my opinion.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|I was extremely impressed with how trivial this was to set up:<br /><br />1) Plug into a USB port and a HDMI port on the TV<br />2) Go to the URL it tells you to<br />3) Install the application & it finds the device (you can customize the name of the device if you have multiple of them).<br />4) Give it your wifi password<br />5) DONE!<br /><br />After that, to watch a movie simply:<br />0) Turn on your TV (doesn't even matter what input I had it on)<br />1) Open up the application you want to play through Chromecast (Netflix, Youtube, Google Play, ...)<br />2) Tell the application that you want it play through chromecast<br />3) The TV switches inputs automatically and starts playing<br /><br />You can control pause/rewind/forward/jump/volume from your device, but you're NOT using twice your wifi bandwidth by streaming to your mobile device from the internet and then having your mobile device stream to the Chromecast.  It's going straight from the internet to Chromecast, and your device can remote control the chromecast, Brilliant!<br /><br />Multiple people on the same network can connect to the chromecast, the last command wins.<br /><br />I have to say, I wish these were everywhere.  It would be great if it had the ability to have the \\"ready to cast\\" screen have customized widgets like Google TV, but I really like the price so maybe in a premium version.
B004SGWYW4|5.0|i love this anime one of my favorites now, i will say this has a lot of fan service some are LOL funny cause of random panty shots! you gotta see this its great!
B00C0FMQQE|5.0|In the age of information,security and terrorism,this book is a must read and so is Trojan Horse! Very cool books!
B0047WJ12K|2.0|But I just can't! I love Leonardo Dicaprio, Marion Cotillard, and Joseph Gordon-Levitt, but his movie was too complicated. Special effects and action sequences don't make a movie good or worth watching. I've watched the movie 3 times and I still don't completely understand it. It also has a very unsatisfying ending. It's not the cast's fault though. I think Christopher Nolan got a little carried away.
B008220C38|3.0|The book is tragic yes thaat is true -- But, this film version is sad in even more ways. The costumes are nice though.
B00CLD671A|5.0|I love the character development and relationship dynamics. I find &#34;the help&#34; the most entertaining and despite some of the hypocrisy of aristocracy, the characters are all so likable....or fun not to like!
B005URRCUY|5.0|While the sound on El Camino is different from previous albums, nearly every song on the album rocks!<br /><br />I, for one, am glad it's not the same as previous releases. They can try new things and still sound amazing.
B003G4W49C|5.0|Great book!!!! My son needed it for summer reading. He loved the book!!!  He loved having the book on his kindle fire.
B00B97SNJI|5.0|From &#34;Just beneath the Surface&#34; through &#34;Side Effects&#34; and a finale of Surface -- be prepared for wonderful story telling and fantastic melodies. From a &#34;Window Seat&#34; is my new favorite flying companion. But, that said, every single song on this CD has a truth that is not often found these days. Clearly, these guys are comfortable inside their skins and they also understand modern life in a way that belies their years. I hope the story of Dawes does not end for a long, long time -- add this to your music line up and I do believe you will agree.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|I like how Mr Hosseini draws you in the story,which keep you want to read to the end. This my 3rd book I read from this writer.
B00AFCEIB0|4.0|I like this search engine.  I use it alot,  It's easy and quick. Use it usually several times a day.
B006LSZECO|2.0|A friend said this was a great book.  I didn't particularly like it.  Didn't like writing style nor the story line.
B005LAIH4A|5.0|The Lorax enchants kids of all ages, and is one of Suess's finest teachings! Get it today and those little ones will see the error of their ways!
B00DHSK3RM|4.0|I find when get to certain level allways want you to buy tokens before let go any further in the game. I feel takes joy from playing.
B0094BB4TW|4.0|I check facebook several times a day.  It's a way I keep in touch with family and friends.  I get many good things off facebook and have the right to speak my opinion.
B002XWXPC8|5.0|This is one of the best movies out there.  Great cast and storyline.  This is a great family movie, comedy!
B005LAIHSG|5.0|Missed this one at the movies, but I'm really glad to have gotten the DVD! This is not a show for younger kids, but it is great entertainment for the older set (more mature tweens & up) -- and a wonderful fantasy adventure for us adult viewers!
B004VMUS9G|5.0|Great!  I'm sure you'll enjoy this, very easy to use.  You can set as many alarms as needed throughout the week.
B0064X7FVE|4.0|I like using the Weather Channel because I can see what is happening all across America.  It's pretty accurate as well.
B00C28J2VQ|4.0|I had to pay for it, rearrange payment in order to obtain it: I finally received it TODAY!! ! !! WoWzers! Thanks Always and more Amazon.com for allowing me these GR8 opportunities as always I'm a HUGE FAN OF Entertainment and obtaining certain products: this will be a first for me as It is rare that I purchase something I haven't seen before. Often times . . . IF IT IS GOOD ENOUGH TO VIEW AGAIN I WILL PURCHASE IT, Hence I rarely purchase something I haven't seen (especially movies whence it may not be thought of as 'that good' or a 'flop'! I wouldn't want to be STUCK with something I don't like/want/need or that I cannot just give away. I used to do that with movies when I lived in WA state I'd get a movie and shortly discover that OOPS I ALREADY OWN THAT or I DON'T WANT THAT ANYMORE! and gift it to friends or frenemies in short I was able to dispossess those extras that weren't wanted. Now I'm kinda &#34;hoping&#34;! that this will be as good or better than imagined. Let's hope and pray it goes my way!! ! !!<br />Always,<br /> LeAnne M Pruitt
B008XG1X18|4.0|Fun but indeed far too addictive!<br />I soon found myself spending far too many hours finding things to add to my boards! Don't get me wrong -- I do like Pinterest, but I've recently limited my own involvement to twice a week. Adding to and checking my boards was fun, but it quickly became too time consuming!<br />So, I've put myself on the Pinterest diet -- this way I can enjoy posting to pinterest twice a week without losing sight of the fact that my real life is far more joyfull and rewarding than anything online!!
B00DYMM76Q|5.0|This album is awesome. So enjoyable. Vince has put together a set of old songs with a modern flavor, yet maintaining the original styles. Refreshing from the modern rock inspired country music today. Love it!
B00BPA2PFM|5.0|glad l bought this as l had a copy of the earlier bluray version and had a lot of voice sync and dropping out problems<br />this has solved that issue and looks great. Happy
B0063M22QO|4.0|A true Mah Jong -- my 2nd fav -- so glad I chanced on this marvelous diversion -- and it clearly meets all the requirements osf a world class game! Entertaining yet confounding - a perfect yin yang game, a great time conquerer!
B004SOR4H6|5.0|I like to see who has been following and who I have been following.  I like the e-mail alerts that are sent to me.
B00EL6ACOI|5.0|I as a child I had dreams of becoming a whale trainer at Sea World,my dreams and goals have changed since then, but not my love for the marine animals. Naturally, when I heard of this movie and watched the preview I was already a \\"sold ticket.\\" I went to the see the movie and I am so glad I did! You walk away learning something that's for sure, the entire time I was glued to my seat and completely captivated. I'm not much of a documentary/activist movie-kind of person, however, this is a must see! I can't wait to buy it.
B008YWY0HK|5.0|This DVD is a real pleasure, and the family and funloving storyline has a lesson for everyone -- it is a charming tale indeed. No one is too young or too old for this one! The animation is sheer perfection, and its images will stay with you long after the credits roll.<br />Do not delay, order this one today!
B008FRFN7A|5.0|I have always used HP products and try not using others.  I would recommend this product to friends, relatives, etc.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|Great read. Sad & happy. Very inspiring. Would recommend to everyone!! I love the references to the Jersey and Philadelphia area. Can't wait to see the movie, but I'm sure the book is better.  It always is.
B008EZVNO0|5.0|The voice still carries the message -- sing because it is a joy. And Van is a joy to listen to. The classic resonance of his voice has been the background to many of my life's happiest events...and I'm glad to have him continue to fill the bill as my troubadour!
B0017SWPXY|4.0|New friend recommended this book.  Lost my beloved rescue dog a year ago, and enough time had passed that this didn't make me sad, but warmed my heart.  Haven't we all personalized our dogs from time to time?  I know nothing about auto racing, and it didn't matter.  Quite enjoyable!
B000O8OTNC|5.0|I generally use this for sharpening pocket knives and serrated camping knives. It is lightweight and works well. I would probably never take it camping, unless it was a very long trip where I would expect to need to sharpen a knife (most trips are much shorter).<br /><br />I keep it in my toolbox and use it occasionally.
B00BGV0YD0|5.0|The Doors are always easy to listen to, not only is this CD taking us down the hall of memory, but it is also a builder of bridges as the younger set likes it too! We can't say enough about the listening joy this CD provides....be prepared to really turn back the clock with this one!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Very engaging and not too tricky to manage. The rooms look interesting and the puzzles are fun. Not a bad way to relax! I would love to play more and I look forward to deeper challenges!
0143035711|5.0|This book is a classic from the Vietnam era.  It is an interesting and bittersweet story of one pilot's experiences.
B0012GMV4O|5.0|The quintessental Leslie West -- get this CD and the decades old charm inside this CD will turn back the clock- try it and see for yourself!
B005K01VZS|5.0|I really enjoyed the book. It is keeping in the same style as the other books i have read from this author.
B0051UP5NQ|5.0|I mostly use this for reading pdfs and docs on my phone. It opens quickly and works good. I would recommend it.
B005S9EJ14|5.0|A fantastic view into a country and a people that have much to offer. The grand cast and wonderful storyline bring us to our feet every time! Every preformer elicts our respect and by films end is beloved and missed. When these seniors come to a critical point in their lives, they come together sincerely and without borders. Our emotions are courted and the courtship pays off-- this film is perfection indeed and is one film that is not to be missed! Wonderful for all adults, but especially meaningful to those who have really experienced life!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Aspiring horse rider (granddaughter) loves this highly detailed graphical horse game, actually a training module for upcoming riders - excellent!!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Love it!!! It has so many versions!!!  You can choose the size of the font. It is amazing. Some of the versions offer you the &#34;audible&#34; choice. Wonderful App. Thank you.
B009EEFTMC|5.0|This game compresses the best aspects of mah jong and cube type games and delivers it consistently! A real winner! You can select moses or try you luck at beat the clock with 2 time options -- and wonder of wonders, practice helps -- knowed the larger time down this week, now I'm on the lookout to knock down the shorter timed puzzle too! And my eyes are meeting challenges more quickly and increasing defination -- which is great for this player -- I'm also a painter!
B00A0ABQLM|5.0|Works as advertised. Love it. But I have not been getting a lot of use out of it since I returned the tablet meant for it. But I am getting a new one so we will see.
B00BTLSURE|5.0|I especially like Counting Stars...love the way that is is both written and sung..<br />Just saw this band in Baltimore....they even sounded better in person.<br />Ryan Tedder has a very versatile voice...Yes I would see them again and soon.  They sang a good amount of songs from this album, which  is why I bought it.
B0088W4YTK|4.0|At first I was hesitant to start watching the series because I really liked SG-1 and didn't want to be disappointed. After watching the first season I was hooked.
B00138CZ8S|5.0|I was introduced to Taj Mahal years ago. Since then I have collected some of the records. They wait patiently to be digitized to be burnt to a CD. The price was too good to pass up. Now it's part of the on going collection of Taj Mahal music. I do believe the Amazon page said there were 75 albums. That's a great deal of ear candy for me.
0394818237|5.0|It's a perennial, all my grand children loved it & still do.<br />And the'll love you too for it!<br />Buy it!
B0013TXA5Y|4.0|From the first chapter on I was sucked in ... taking no time before I could hardly put it down
0761163808|5.0|This book is great for any age! There are no books that are like this one.  It feels like you are able to see the animal
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Love the bananas. And just wait till you ride on fluffy.  Love it. Now everyone ba-ba-bananas ba-ba-ba-bananas ba- ba-ba-bananas. Potatoe
B0064MPXFA|5.0|I couldn't put it down, so to speak.  The character development is wonderful.  Planning to watch all available seasons and hoping for more.  I want to be Juliana Marguilis in my next life --- brilliantly done.
1452126577|5.0|I have my own copy of this book and this one is the second one I have now purchased for family and friends.  I have them hooked on Grumpy Cat!
B00CLMA3HK|5.0|I am not a sci-fi fan, however.... lol<br />I absolutely LOVED this !<br />Not the run of the mill alien shoot 'em up.....<br />Historical inclusions, romance, fast paced, adventure, danger.... & the Good guys win.<br /><br />Held my attention from the get go & not once did I stop until I finished ....<br />Beats the pants off Raiders of the Lost Ark !!!<br />I have totally & thoroughly enjoyed reading AURORA CONSPIRACY  & look forward to more from this author.<br /><br />Miss Emma
1936608898|5.0|This book has changed my life; my asthma is 80% better.  A life time diet for me.  I highly recommend
1452126607|5.0|I bought this as a gift for someone for Christmas.  I am sure he is going to love it.  The photos on it are adorable.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Great game to pass the time. Challenging so it keeps you thinking but not impossible so you want to keep playing.
B00AREIAI8|3.0|well i don't like it that much its fun at first but after a while it gets boring so no I don't like it that much
B00DYCBH4O|5.0|I enjoyed this book because it was told in such a fashion where I adored the characters and fell in love while the characters fell in love.
B006JPS1OM|5.0|very entertaining. this keeps you entertained and is hard to stop playing.  I have a hard time stopping.  It is a great game.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game is awesome with killing and I made a nice house on this game. I Don't know why some people gave it 1 star.
B00A1U2SVS|3.0|It was good to hear the band play together again.  They had a good selection of songs and everyone performed pretty well, except Jimmy Page probably had the sloppiest performance that I have heard in a long time.
B00BIK06JG|5.0|This is the kind of case that was popular in the old days of the 35 mm film camera, where the shape of the case closely conforms to the shape of the camera, so that it is as compact as possible. It is called a \\"ever-ready\\" case because the camera stored inside the case can be put into action quickly.<br /><br />I like this Sony LCJ-HL/B Jacket Case for the DSC-HX300 camera because it is very compact, comes with a very secure hand strap, and is made of a nice, man-made, leather-like material. You can loop the case and the hand strap together, so that the case can hang \\"in the air\\" while you take pictures with your camera. I do caution that if you use the hand strap instead of the neck strap, putting in or taking out the camera should be done close to a tabletop, or somewhere there is support, so that you do not accidentally drop the camera, before you have a chance to put your hand through the hand strap. A more secure way is to always loop your hand through the hand strap BEFORE putting in or taking out the camera.<br /><br />The hand strap is attached to the camera via two points: the screw-in tripod socket and the right strap ringlet. The bottom of the screw is threaded, so that you can mount the camera/hand strap/case on a tripod without removing the hand strap.<br /><br />If you need to throw your HX300 camera into a suitcase or travel bag, this case will protect your camera while taking up as little space as possible.<br /><br />As indicated on the case box, this case is compatible with Sony HX300, HX200V, and HX200.<br /><br />Update: I just noticed the case box has an illustration of how the neck strap and the hand strap can be attached to the HX300 AT THE SAME TIME, so that you can choose the best method to hold the camera for a particular moment.
B005FQ2H8W|4.0|Makes you wonder ! - sensitive performances without the modern day over-the-top special effects that makes the story-telling more believable - Would recommend it to even non- scifi buffs !
B007D2XSW0|4.0|add to my cell phone makes it much easy to use the phone to and pictures but I think it is call the person that is using it I am just now finding out how to use it
B00003CXBH|4.0|I found this movie interesting & educational. I can't say I liked the outcome but it is based on a real life situation. It is the way it is.
B00B89LZ4C|4.0|....and that's about it, the figure doesn't move at all and sometimes has a hard time standing let alone hold any of the accessories. The best attribute about this figure is that it looks awesome and that the hat and glasses are removable. Overall, a cool looking mini plastic statue of Heisenberg but if you're looking for articulation then this isn't for you. In all honesty, I would've preferred if Funko had gotten the license rights instead of Mezco, my shelf would be complete with some Breaking Bad Pops!
B004GJDQT8|5.0|faster to find on my phone because my laptop is not working right so I think it is a must you can do everything on it you can on the laptop and desktop
B00E8B1P9M|3.0|Wasn't as good as the first one.  Lots of action but not enough plot or story line.  Watched it twice and didn't like it anymore the second time.  Sorry Rock :(
B0071XO8RA|5.0|As far as the post apocalyptic genre is concerned, I'm all in for Wool. I found this book to be as compelling a read as &#34;The Road&#34;, &#34;The Passage&#34; and del Toro's recent trilogy.<br /><br />I hope I get through most of the novels Hugh Howey has written before he gets signed. It'll be less expensive for me anyway. But someone needs to sign him so that these novels can be enjoyed by mass market distribution.<br /><br />I am so impressed!  Great writing.
B00AX6KNOY|4.0|It's always refreshing to see high school authoritarians exposed as alien monsters in disguise.<br />It just gets it out there in the open and that's a plus for high school students in prep for today's<br />average college life.
B007PVHMCG|3.0|The only reason I give it this rating is because it's not worth the money. My son put it together and hasn't played with it since.
B009HQ9UHC|4.0|My kids enjoy this game. They like to try build things so that the<br />piggies can make it to the finish line.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is so great it helps me with remembering all of those horse words such as tack and mane
B009LQKHIO|1.0|This reads very much like a first attempt. The main characters have no depth, and their relationship has no substance. There are grammar and punctuation errors throughout, and many awkward segues and conversations. This book is written with entirely too many words; the author ends to be redundant. Also, there is no flow regarding time. It seems like Megan was having her cast removed for weeks.<br />I did like the fact that Megan was taking strides to take back control of her life, as well as moving on with her brother's bed and breakfast vision. That took great courage, and it's a wonderful ideal to spotlight.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|My kids asked for this game. I guess they like the guy<br />running and jumping over objects. I never played it so I<br />guess I'll give it a try.
B00AZL3PBK|5.0|Some free games suck but this game doesnt kids love it and you will too its kinda like super Mario bros wii
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Have just finished watching Season 1 and wanted to start Season 2 as soon as possible.  The ordering process is quite simple and I have been able to start watching Season 2 immediately.
0143113100|5.0|I thought this book was a great read. It helped me deal with some habits I formed over the years and helped me understand why it has been so hard to change them.
B00ANGSSWS|1.0|I do like some of bvb songs,but it just sounds like glam hard rock,and it really isn't the best music ive heard.I don't like concept albums also,so that kind of takes away from them,but I do recccomend it to people who like glam rock,but its definitely something im not shelling out 20 bucks for.
B009UNGYHG|5.0|I really like this product, it protects the headset while its being charge and can recharge twice without being plug in,great for trips.<br />Robt S
B00846REIS|5.0|Read this when you have the whole day to yourself! The writing is very good, easily paints graphic images with words alone.
1932100660|5.0|I think everybody has the right to know why the American diet undermines our good intentions and how to change that
B00COHAUD4|4.0|This was a scary movie.  It's not appropriate for little kids, but not too terrible for teens.  A better scary movie than those back woods, idiot 30 somethings acting like teens going out camping in the woods and getting slashed.
B007PT3QOQ|1.0|Loved it until update, now it sends me to app store which sends me back to the game which sends me back to the app store ad nauseum.
B009NPK1IO|5.0|Definitely worth the money because its much cheaper to buy them for instant watch than buy the actual DVDs. You finally get answers this season. I enjoyed every episode of it!
B0000TAZBK|4.0|I've always been a HUGE LOTR fan ever since 1999 when The Fellowship of the Ring was released in theaters. The soundtracks have always been there for me to listen to and to make me feel as if I were actually in The Shire or in the middle of Mordor every time I listen to them. And that's exactly what this trilogy set has meant to me; I feel like I'm watching the films again and again when I put this on to play.<br />Although the music is fantastic and the price is just as fantastic, I found that the first track of The Fellowship of the Ring soundtrack and the first track of The Return of the King soundtrack were full of static noise. I played it from the CD itself before ripping it into iTunes, and the first track was all full of static on these 2 albums. It's impossible to listen to and enjoy with this noise going on, unfortunately. That's not too bad, but I still wish it weren't there. Despite this, though, I love these soundtracks and my favorite ones are static-free. This is a CD bundle set that MUST be bought by any true LOTR fan.
B00DH1G7DS|4.0|Works great on my galaxy s4.<br /><br />Taking one star off because it should be an option to let you put a wrong number in and then you have to find the mistake yourself.<br /><br />Great game to waste time with.
B00CB4ET0K|5.0|I thought that the app was awesome. It has a lot of amazing challenges. I can't wait for more games to come out.
B00003CXCT|3.0|I was a little disappointed in that the DVD;s were scratched but they played ok. The box was slightly worn as described, but that was ok because it was replacing VHS tapes that had been well-played.
B00E8B1P9M|3.0|Just another vanilla day in Hollywood...way too many of these quasi-stimulating movies these days...good for vegetating/a semi-comatose on the couch...
B009C7ZQM4|4.0|This app is ok it does what it says  it could be better like adding some more features on it
0786948523|4.0|Gives the rules and makes it easier to play the game. Every D&D player will get something out of it.
B00CWVGBEO|5.0|Arnold is awesome in this movie as usual and recommend it to anyone that enjoys a good action movie. Years Best
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|This game is fun fun and very affordable, not as easy as it looks either,I love it so much and you will too, promise.
B00COO2D6O|1.0|good luck with this game. They want you to pay for everything you do.<br />here's an idea - charge me what you want for the game. and be done with it. I constantly got prompted in the middle of a game to pay for this or that. very annoying.
B000VS2V80|5.0|I recently bought Backless to replace a copy that I lost years ago. While it doesn't have a monstrous hit like Cocaine on it, I dare say it's a better album than Slowhand. Backless came out one year after Slowhand and uses almost the same line-up of musicians. However, I think it's a more even listening experience and does have some classic Clapton songs on it. It hasn't been reissued on vinyl but you can get it digitally, or there are still a few sealed records from back in the day floating around. (That's what I bought.) All in all I'd recommend this album to any Eric Clapton fan no matter how casual. It really is a criminally overlooked record in his catalog.
B00004TDTO|5.0|good summer movie! we love to see it AFTER we have our vacation at the beach.  Have a wonderful summer.
B004W2UBYW|5.0|A thought provoking book. A must read for everyone regardless if your pro Microsoft or not. I will read this again and again.
B009NG1Q96|4.0|It is kind of like Hunger Games, but not as good. I liked the book and enjoyed reading it. I'm looking forward to the next one coming out in august 2014.
B007D2XSW0|2.0|App works in great but you can't save it to your gallery, all you can do is stare at it. The only way to share the picture is on Facebook and Twitter, no email or mms
B00DJYK9F0|1.0|I love Passenger and their music, but this vinyl skips like a little girl playing hopscotch. I have done everything to try and remove any debris and it still skips at the same place on the first two songs
B00E1JUT70|5.0|From order to receipt was only 4 days; and it came from a supplier in Germany! I have been waiting to get my hands on this little beast, and can say it beats my expectations. The biggest surprise is this boards size; ASUS packed alot of serious technical functionality into the design. I will now start building my 2nd gaming rig from today:)
B005IQ39AY|3.0|I really like this game, but it needs an update to fix the glitches. It says game failed when nothing got below the line nor out of balls. Please fix and send an update. Thanks!
1781162646|5.0|Very entertaining, fast paced story as one would expect from a Hard Case Crime novel. I have bought two other Hard Case Crime novels since this one. Great to take on the road with you when you travel.
B0064X7FVE|1.0|I was the best weather app out there, until another version came out. Now it's confusing and has a stupid point system. Hate this new version.
1451627289|5.0|My only complaint is that I need to get some sleep. Very different that what I expected. I guess we should all know that Stephen King will no write any story we would anticipate when we first pick up any of his novels. Well done, as always. Thanks
B0087GF8ZG|5.0|I needed a night light that would turn on with a motion sensor in my toilet stall.  I live in a men's dorm where the amount of light in the bathroom has to be kept low so as not disturb my dorm companions.  This provides excellent light and the motion sensor works well.
B004JN1D2I|5.0|The first book hooks you right away.  You have to keep reading and now I am just waiting for the next book.  Please hurry and write it already...
B005FVNIW6|4.0|I took up Ender's Game and started reading it. I didn't know that a movie was scheduled for release in November. The book is gripping. The end makes Ender's Game a true classic. Sometimes you are reminded of &#34;Lord of the Flies&#34; because there are children involved in the story. Overall, a good read.
B00BRH2MN8|5.0|Wonderous EP by a wonderful young artist! I can't wait to hear what is next from her. One of the best artists out there.
B00DRPVE3M|5.0|Good game and lots of fun.  Would like to see new versions to change the game up.  Would like more chips to play for free.
B0091REZMW|4.0|I enjoy the graphics, story line, and greenness of the entire game. Helps to pass the time at the dentist waiting room and the toilet. No pop ups as well and I dig that man.
B00C25TCZ0|3.0|As just about every rock fan and his Lynott loving Aunty knows, Black Star Riders were previously Thin Lizzy.<br />Or at least the band that performed live as Thin Lizzy, featuring ex-Lizzy guitarist Scott Gorham and, since 2009, vocalist Ricky Warwick of The Almighty.<br /><br />However the reformed Thin Lizzy, even with original drummer Brian Downey and one-time Lizzy keyboard player Darren Wharton were in the ranks, had as many detractors as they had die-hard followers.<br /><br />For every fan who championed keeping the music (a)live, another felt the name, legacy and absolutely irreplaceable Phil Lynott should be left to rest in peace.<br /><br />However the decision to record an album of all-new material, along with the departure of Downey and Wharton, brought with it a name change and the chance to establish an identity for a new band featuring Gorham, Warwick, Damon Johnson (guitars), Marco Mendoza (bass guitar) and latest recruit Jimmy DeGrasso on drums.<br /><br />And what of that identity?<br /><br />Well the title track rattles out of the speakers before delivering a solid, mid-tempo pulse and punchy if predictable chorus, but the short twin-guitar melody bridge is straight from the Thin Lizzy songbook.<br /><br />The nod to Thin Lizzy is followed by the best song Lizzy never wrote, `Bound For Glory,' recalling (outside of an intro almost identical to Whitesnake's `Guilty of Love') the classic Black Rose era with its `Get Out of Here' punch, chorus shout-backs, trademark solo and twin-harmony guitars to the fore.<br /><br />'Bound For Glory' also highlights Ricky Warwick's vocal similarities to Phil Lynott (a natural similarity, not a mimicked tonality).<br />But, depending on your musical point of view, Warwick's Lynott-esque phrasing and inflections (no doubt more pronounced from having performed so many Lizzy songs over the last four years) either help or hinder proceedings.<br /><br />The Lizzy family links continue with the Celtic rock of `Kingdom of the Lost,' a tribute to Gary Moore and his own Celtic/ Wild Frontier era if ever I heard one, and `Bloodshot,' a Celtic-tinged, hard rocking Lizzy/ Gary Moore hybrid.<br /><br />And sadly when the songs aren't sound-a-likes they are either generic, 4/4 hard rock (`Kissin' the Ground,' `Hoodoo Voodoo') or second-rate Lizzy pastiches (`Hey Judas').<br /><br />The heavy melodic pop of `Someday Salvation' helps freshen things up however, but the overly long closer `Blues Ain't So Bad' makes for an anti-climatic ending.<br /><br />All of which leads to the conclusion a far better introduction to Black Star Riders would have been an EP, featuring the band's best four or five songs.<br /><br />Because the Black Star Riders debut was only ever going to work if the material was strong throughout the entire album and didn't rely too heavily on the Lizzy sound, allowing the band to forge their own identity.<br /><br />Despite what the die-hard Thin Lizzy fans and Scott Gorham supporters will hear or report, All Hell Breaks Loose fairs poorly on the first count while the jury is still out on the second.<br /><br />And won't return with a verdict until The Boys Are Back in Town with their next album.
0307938905|5.0|I loved this audio book, I stayed until late hours just listening to it.  The narrator did an excellent job, his accent just made the story so awesome.  I got so involved with the characters that I will certainly listen it to it again, all throughout the narration it seemed like I was there, I could hear and feel exactly the characters felt.  Extraordinarily written and Extraordinarily narrated!  Definitely recommend this book to everyone, you will not be disappointed.
B0041D843M|5.0|I was a vegetarian prior to reading this book so maybe he's preaching to the converted with me.<br />But this book is surely the most convincing well researched book on diet and why we should care  ever written. Now I know why what I eat is so important.<br />It will make you look at foods very differently guaranteed.
B007MG360G|2.0|This game is nothing compared to Doodle God.  First off, the pairings make no sense and then they highlight the elements that can be used and cant.  That makes it very easy and not nearly as enjoyable as Doodle God.  And I was able to play it within 5 hours from start to finish.  No challenge what so ever.  I would say, if you are looking at this game and haven't tried Doodle God or Doodle Devil (which are the same just with different skins) i would go with one of those.  Not only do the pairs make sense, its challenging and a whole lot longer not to mention fun.
B00CV5ZPA2|5.0|Couldnt be happier, was a bitrhday gift and arrived early. was in perfect condition upon arrival. We dont have a music store cl8se to where we live so this made it much easier to buy. Thank you
B000I9U9A4|5.0|We rented from Amazon because we couldn't find our copy here at home.  Master and Commander is a master piece for those who love adventure.
098555780X|4.0|This is a good book for learning many new (at least to me) ways to weave paracord into lots of interesting patterns.  I haven't tried all of them yet and the hardest part is to get your project to look as nice as the ones in the book but it can be done by using consistent technique.
B009XIXVU6|2.0|Couldn't finish it, just went nowhere and jumped around too much I gave up at 70%  I liked the beginning and rhe characters but lost them along the way
B001ANSSDC|5.0|So unique, engrossed instantly and could not put down. I felt I was along for Pat' s journey, although I just felt sad, thinking you poor son of a b****. But I still rooted for him. And I totally wasn't expecting some of the plot twists, but wad pleasantly surprised. I read before I watched the film version, and hope it serves this fabulous novel justice. Can I give it 6 stars???
B004V9MU86|4.0|At first I didn't think I would enjoy this book, it was very slow moving and the writing style was difficult to get used to.<br /><br />However I pushed through, as it had been recommended by a friend, and I am glad I did. Once involved I couldn't put it down.<br /><br />My biggest problem was trying to read it on my phone, the story book within the story was unreadable.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This app is awesome and fun. It's supposed to be based off of temple run but it's better than temple run.
B00AHJL7BK|4.0|This is a thinking game and it really makes me think. I enjoy playing it when I get a few minutes to myself.
B00AYHKIZ6|5.0|Wonderful to hear new Bowie songs after many years, I play CD all the time; can't get tired of it; wonderful music, great seller
B005GFPZYK|5.0|I had been curious about this book for awhile and finally got it. Chris wrote a great book. I felt like I knew him. I only wish I could have read this book while Chris was alive. God bless all of our veterans and Chris's family.
B00992CF6W|5.0|It's the time of minecraft I keep on playing<br />That I never get board with it cause it's awesome that my tablet kills it's skin<br />I can't believe that
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|One of  the only games i use on my tablet. It is very fun and addicting so yeah download it
B009LQKHIO|4.0|This was a very enjoyable book that made me smile and I appreciated the way it described the people living in Pride.  Jill has a talent writing so that you can picture the people and places.  I liked getting to know them.  I eagerly look forward to the second one in this series.
0812993845|5.0|I read this while on a flight and I was laughing outloud frequently.  Didn't mind the people looking at me or the uncomfortable seats..the book was so enjoyable
B005LAII80|3.0|I did not find this film as entertaining as the Stallone version, but it isn't that bad.  It didn't seem to have as much of a plot/story to it, relying more heavily on special/3D effects to keep it moving.
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|Its a fun game but I can't play too long because the energy runs out too quickly. I like playing when I can.
B009MO5ES8|5.0|Definitely worth watching.  Joseph Gordon-Levitt at his best, with more than a few plot twists you don't see coming.  This film has a bit of everything - action, drama, comedy, suspense, mystery...  OK, almost everything.  There is no science fiction, but you get caught up in the story so strongly that you don't even notice.  Definitely worth the time to watch.
B003G4W49C|4.0|I had heard of Ender's Game for a number of years and been given to understand that it was a true landmark in science fiction genre, even to the point where several of the Armed Services made it obligatory reading at their various educational institutions.  For those who are deep into analyzing every nuance of a writer's craft and hidden or 'other' meanings behind the words, Ender's Game would undoubtedly provide ample room to maneuver in this regard. From my own perspective I found much of the story line to be somewhat predictable, even in the final outcome the thoughts of alternatives to the seemingly obvious situation were percolating such that I didn't find quite as much fascination by the ending.
B006P0FIB0|4.0|Ancient musketeers battling on airships.....  Well worth it in 3D.  If you are looking for a more traditional telling of the tail this one is not for you.  But if you are looking for an imaginative, fantastic retelling of this classic tale, upgraded to make better use of 3D you will likely enjoy this film.  And, if you're a fan of Milla Jovovitch, well she's here and in a much different role than usual.  Watch it.
B007A4SDCG|5.0|Right to the point. Giving everyday and practical down<br />to earth information.<br /><br />He has a great style of writing. I loved it.
B002ZG98UK|5.0|I loved this movie in the theaters.  I loved it when I purchased it on DVD.  And when I finally upgraded to HDTV and went 3D I just had to upgrade this film as well.
B000UJCALI|5.0|It was everything I thought it would be. There was a sense of errieness throughout the whole film. Especially the first bar scene with Jack and Lloyd in the Gold Room. There was also a feel of isolation in the film as well, like you were actually there, that was creepy enough. For those of you who haven't watched The Shining, and are thinking about getting it, I highly recommend that you do. There is not a horror film that could be as great as the Shining, or will there ever be one as great as The Shining. So sit back on your couch with the lights out and prepare to be scared, creeped out and don't forget. All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy. SO with that being said HERE'S JOHNNY!!!!!!!!!! And stay out of Room 237.
B007N8RULO|5.0|i have been working on spider for about a year.  i think every age group can play this game because you play against yourself.
B00CATSONE|5.0|A really great book. Really shows how a man did everything he could to do what he had a passion for. I highly recommended this book. A five star for sure.
B00881VLCE|5.0|i love to do puzzels with a challenge.  i like to work on difficult pictures.  some times a stay up all night.
B0067R0APK|3.0|This app is slow and prone to crashing. Use weather.com as a backup. When it works, this is a great app. However, the free app is the same, so you don't need to pay for this.
0385349947|5.0|Sheryl says she didn't believe she was a feminist (neither did I)<br />but by the end of the book, there's no avoiding it.  The work to attain equality between the genders has begun, but is not finished.  This is a great book for both Women and Men.<br />My professional organization is planning a Women's Luncheon to celebrate successful professional women in our industry, and to have a public discussion on what works, and what doesn't.<br />thank you Sheryl.
B00BB3UYS8|5.0|I can tell that the author poured his heart and soul into this book.  The details of the story seem almost surreal.  A teenager kid that discovers his inner powers through mystics he finds along his journey.  This is a great young adult read about past lives and how they affect your present and your future.  I can't wait for the next book in the series.
B004GYY714|5.0|I have TuneIn Radio on my iPad, Android phone and was happy to find a version for the Kindle Fire. I especially love listening to NPR on the weekends and I do it through TuneIn Radio. If I miss a show on my local NPR I can catchup with it on another area's station. Great stuff!!
B0052UZIFA|1.0|It is very disappointing that Amazon still has this version available. As far as I can tell, it is a version delivered only to Amazon for the free App of the day. It has not been updated in over a year and does not correlate with the Google Play version or the Kindle version on this store.<br /><br />Do yourself a favor and purchase it on the Google Play Store. That version is feature comparable to the iOS version.
B006GWO5NE|4.0|This one definately seems sturdier than the one that come with the fire. I am satisified with it so far.
B00003CXCT|5.0|I watched all three with my 4 1/2 year old grandson who loves star wars. He wanted me to see it all and not look at my computer while the movie was on. We really enjoyed the experience.
0307476073|5.0|I do trail walks/runs every other day, and 5 miles seems like forever to me (senior citizen), so this tale of a very LONG walk was inspiring.<br /><br />Strayed is an excellent writer -- every sentence is beautifully constructed.
B00AV68GOA|5.0|Very interesting.  As captivating to read as to view on screen.<br />Looking forward to read the Scripts for Seasons 2 and 3.
B00AQNOCZ0|5.0|Me and my family really enjoyed this set and can't stop watching them. all disks worked really well and this was a great buy! and as always Amazon Rocks!!!
B0052AC8C6|4.0|This movie was certainly worth watching. It had plenty of humor for kids and adults alike. Its worth a shot.
B00499QUK2|5.0|It's a clever series that draws you in.  The acting is very good and the cinematography is stunning.  It's worth watching more than once as there are so many things going on it's easy to miss something.
B005DNPKSQ|3.0|This movie didn't really exhibit the common form of Jim Carrey. It lacked his light heartedness. Worth watching but not buying.
B003YCI1O8|5.0|Great movie from the 90's and some good bonus features on this bluray. And got the movie earlier then I was suppose too.
B008HK3XOU|5.0|I love the ability to stand up my kindle to watch a movie on the plane.  It is a good case.
B00AO2P3GA|5.0|For  awhile this was 99 coins and i snatched it before it got higher! Keep up the good work Gameloft!
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|I did not want to read because I did not want it to end!  I love this book because it captures all emotions like sadness, happiness and mystery.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|It's awesome fun and very addicting once u get the hang of it!!!! But once u get there it's a lot of fun! Haven't been a leader to put it down since I got the app!
B00005R24K|5.0|A true classic, which fostered the Evil Dead remake, with updated special effects. The film quality is that of 70's ish movies so do not expect visual eye candy in this movie. This is a must for any Army of Darkness/Evil Dead fan.
B001N1DPDE|5.0|I'll keep it simple - the Becker BK2 is probably the toughest and best 5&#34; blade that is heavy duty capable.<br /><br />Arguable rivals include the Ontario SP47, the RAT5, and to a lesser extent, the Schrade SCHF10.<br /><br />The BK2 is a 1/4 of an inch thick, so don't be taken off guard by the weight and heft. If you want something lighter and smaller, this is not your knife. If you want tough, thick, top notch blade quality and craftsmanship with an ability to do heavy tasks, this is your blade. It's a bit short for some jobs, but will tackle most that don't require great length, with no problem at all.
B005DJREGQ|5.0|Great to see youth from a different perspective. Access to technology and information is a blessing and a curse. I enjoyed the fresh characters and honesty.
B009AMANH4|5.0|I remember much of my American History, but this really helped me to refresh it.  Something to go back and view over and over again.
B004QZ9PLU|4.0|What can you say about Nicholas Sparks books? They are all good. This is no exception. But it is not a &#34;typical&#34; Sparks story. This will keep you up late and it will be hard to put down. The story is unusual but enjoyable. Don't pass this one by. And have a box of tissues handy. Don;t you love Amazon....they can make you think, laugh, and cry.
B00ECU34ZM|3.0|The effects to this movie and concept are amazing. However, the beginning camaraderie could have been shortened if not all together edited out to lengthen the actual plot line.. I wanna see more Jaime Lannister and Morgan Freeman!
B003ZZAXNG|2.0|I've followed PF for all the years and enjoyed the many twists and turns, but this effort of Barrett post PF is just garbage; less Terrapin. Was it just an attempt to give him studio time to placate his removal? Who knows...but his illness is very apparent in this piece.
B0042U94UQ|5.0|Despicable Me (Single-Disc Edition)<br />Steve Carell<br />How do you rate this product?<br /><br />Review Your Purchase<br /><br />wonderful we all love it!
1582701709|5.0|Although I did not take everything literally, (I actually found myself rolling my eyes quite a bit) I still took a lot from this book. I have been trying to cut out all of the negativity from my life, and this book has great ways on how to do that. I highlighted anything that effected me, and I still flip through every now and then and reread what I highlighted.
B00947N6D8|5.0|wonderful we all love it!<br /><br /> Rise of the Guardians<br />Chris Pine<br />How do you rate this product?<br />wonderful we all love it!
B004GJDQT8|5.0|I use Amazon often and this app makes it very easy to use on my Android tablet. Thanks Amazon for this free app.
B00DP3IESY|5.0|Not sure what I liked so much about this movie so a review will be difficult. Clever plot, Cruise was great, and the movie was serene, interesting, and nostalgic.
B004DLPXAO|3.0|I need to be able to establish a delegate file for each type of magazine or book with subfiles for each magazine or book series. Having all the books or magazine's lumped in together just doesn't work for me!
B00028HBKM|4.0|I did like to watch this movie even though it was a bit sad<br />to see sweet baby Jesus get beat. The movie was very clear<br />the sound effects, captivating, and the money was well spent.
193700788X|1.0|Based on the reviews of \\"Dead Ever After\\", I can see that this book is truly dead in the water.  I have no desire to read it and am thankful for the individuals who took the time to express their discontent with the novel.  Shame on you Charlaine Harris.
B0044IABFS|5.0|The ending was sad.  The series over the top, in that one has to forget reality, in terms of the continuous situations of the series.  But, hey, that is why its called TV!
B0087IT8FK|5.0|WOW! French movies of the last 40 years bored me to death. They were all sad, umbilistic (is that a word? How long can a French cineaste look at his own navel? Thirty years?), not to say pretentious and self-serving.<br />Here comes a French movie (with subtitles) that has content and some hope. Finally.<br />It is the story of the friendship between a paraplegic and a caregiver. It is warm, well acted and generous. The main reason I liked it is that both heroes grow from the experience. It is well acted.<br />It is about friendship overlapping culture and money. It is credible, just as [[ASIN:B004X4R49Y The King's Speech]].A pleasure. MERCI!
B00BNGFGIQ|5.0|My children love it, and so do I!  This adorable game has you flipping your chimp in the air via trampoline. You have to jump through bananas and grab them, as well as diamonds.  It is low stress, and great to make you smile.
B00CUWWLWG|1.0|I've had this game on my kindle fire months now, and it just stopped working all together.  It will load up and then crash on me.  I've tried to un install and re install and it doesn't help.
B0062QRTKA|4.0|Yes, the game has a slightly irreverent flavor to it, but only slightly.  As a strong Christian, I was not uncomfortable or offended by it.  It is cute, and challenging.  The thrill does wear off pretty quickly once you get stuck for too long, but it is worth .99
B003JH8LPW|4.0|This novel began slowly but picked up the pace quickly.  The ending was foreseeable but with several twists. Worth the read.
B00AESN8XY|5.0|I had my doubts because of the creepy idea behind the game- exterminating the entire world population as a virus.  This is truely interesting and educational, though.  There is an endless variety of ways you can play the game to increase the challenge as you continue to play.  You will get hooked!
0316228583|4.0|Reminiscent of the girl with the dragon tattoo with introduction to so many characters so quickly.  It was hard to keep straight who was who and how tied together and that is important to me so it was slow for me as I had to go back and re-read to get how the characters were related, not necessarily by blood but in some cases by location or profession, etc...she is a spectacular author, just takes a lot of work for me as I said I have to know how all tie together to make me happy, so not a good afternoon read just for leisure, I had to think to keep up.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I couldn't put this book down. I literally read it in less than 24 hours. The writing style is just so darn entertaining! Great story.
B0082SU98U|5.0|For lovers of old fashioned values and simplicity you can`t fault this book. Young and old alike will enjoy the delightful story which has stood the test of time.
B00CRMWMZ0|2.0|This record is incredibly over-rated.<br /><br />In general it really just lacks songs, and originality.<br /><br />More throw away filler for the style over substance day and age we're living in.<br /><br />The Panda Bear track is killer though.  Why wasn't that the single?  Get Lucky....pretty lame in my opinion.
B001EN71DQ|5.0|I ordered this for my 12 year old grandson. He was so thrilled and watches it over and over. I recommend it for all Grandmas and Grandpas that need ideas for their grandchildren. The package arrived quickly and I am very satisfied with seller.
000744804X|1.0|I'm really upset about this company, cause i ordered a different edition books the one that was published on 2006 not the one of 2011, is not just the edition is the size of the book and also the price they charge me 41 dollar for something that is 16 dollars, I want my money back and also, I want to tell everybody that want a buy  something from this company to be careful, they are gonna scam you. .
0385349947|4.0|Enjoyed thinking through my own leadership as a woman pastor through Sheryl's lens. And I still need 7 more words.

B00AHJL7BK|4.0|i got this game for free, and for that price this game is definitely worth it. if you like sudoku you will like this.
B004Y03LQ2|5.0|Great!!!  What more can I say about the greatness of this one of a kind band. Metal keep on rockin'
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|Didn't care for the ending.  Ending is starting to sound like the ending of &#34;Fifty Shades.&#34;  Will read next book in hopes that things turn around.
B009ZZDNT6|3.0|if u just want a alarm clock this is the best<br />if u want what it says just get the 99cent one<br />turst me<br />never going through again
B003O86FMW|4.0|Good & Easy read. Ending makes you want to start the third book of the series. Eager to see how the movie follows the book.
B008JFUNYG|5.0|I wasn't to excited about this remake but I actually felt a little better when I heard there was no ash character and finally seeing the movie it exceeded my expectations it doesn't have the humor of the rami movies but that worked for this one highly reccomond this.
B0000025T6|5.0|Great album, great music. My husband took it over and I have not seen it since. I believe he plays it constantly.
B00D23K0MU|5.0|I have always enjoyed Maysa's albums. The quality of the production is always great. Her voice is wonderful and unique. My favorite cuts are &#34;Inside My Dream&#34;, &#34;When Your Soul Answers&#34;,&#34;Pouring Rain&#34;, &#34;Be There&#34;, and &#34;Quiet Fire&#34;.<br /><br />Great chill out music as well.
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|This is an amazing story....the author does a wonderful job of telling it....a real page turner...I couldn't put it down. This true story of nobility...honor....bravery....and virtue left me in tears.<br /><br />Also, I don't believe I have ever read a book about WWII from the German side...very informative .<br /><br />This book would make a great movie or mini-series
B004XUMMFE|5.0|I like Sci-Fi, and my wife likes westerns.  This is THE show that we both like very much!  The Movie is a must see as well!
B009WUBERW|3.0|Entertaining but not going to win any awards.  Worth the watch especially you like any of the movies from the plethora of stars in it.
0345525558|4.0|It surprised me that I enjoyed this book so very much. I had avoided it even though it appeared on so many lists and was prominently featured in \\"semi-personalized\\" recommendations generated on websites based on my previous reading.  Perhaps, I expected it to be sappy? Despite the title, this book is not a Hallmark Channel special. The story is told with skill. It is revealed gradually. Ms. Diffenbaugh has created characters that one cares about. Parts of the story are far-fetched and most of it is very far removed from the reality of my childhood and my role as mother. Nevertheless, I believed this story and cared a great deal about her characters. Despite the title, this is not a romance, but it is a story of love. Ms. Diffenbaugh's descriptions of the twists and turns of a foster child's life are vivid and painful. Victoria is written to be intelligent, resilient, damaged, self-destructive, self-reliant, needy, young and old all at the same time.  Victoria has unique insight into the needs of her customers (portrayed as almost magical) and significant handicaps in her ability to forge healthy relationships. Ms. Diffenbaugh manages to make these internally contradictory attributes make sense for Victoria. There were many times when Victoria does something that I so did not want to believe that she would do, but I did believe it. You cannot read a newspaper or watch the news without stories that report analogous events. Even when Victoria does something that is criminal or inexcusable, Ms. Diffenbaugh has made the actions believable and understandable. She has shared and taught some insight through this novel. The details of the plot are not shared here because I want you to read the book and have everything unfold as Ms. Diffenbaugh wrote it. The exact details of the story will fade in my memory (ironically, the language of flowers is already fading) but there will be parts of it that will stay with me.
B00AALHW6Y|5.0|I am a big fan of Darius Rucker. His music is pure country. It is fun to listen to his songs.
B00499QUK2|5.0|Clever, fun, interesting and wonderful British humor. Benedict Cumberbatch is fantastic. Writers are creative - I like the twists of the updated Sherlock Holmes stories.
B00BLCHYKU|5.0|love what i have watched so far.  feels like you are right there.  great costuming, and casting helps the whole thing
193700788X|1.0|Knowing from the cover that it was the final book in the series put an odd taste in my mouth and I felt it tainted my perception of the story.<br /><br />I feel that our original Sookie has been influenced by the TV doppelganger Sookie, and not in a good way.<br /><br />This book was not up to par for me. It was missing one of the main reasons I became a Sookie fan in the first place. I (and I feel safe in saying, we) liked Sookie for her eternal kindness, fairness, and unrelenting optimism in the face of an ever-growing awareness of a world which tried its damnedest to take those away. While she sometimes failed, she always tried to be kind, fair, and optimistic.<br /><br />This feels more like a let's gather all the loose ends and find a way to close the series effort than a true let's end the series with a great story and a memorable book effort.<br /><br />As much as I have loved this series, this book left me feeling distinctly unsatisfied. It felt as if Ms. Harris is tired of Sookie. Sadly, that is now how I feel as well. I suppose it is a good thing this is the final book in that case.<br /><br />I give it 1 star. (I almost gave it 2, then I decided that was due to my affection for Sookie from previous books, not the actual quality of this one.)
B00D3V85FA|2.0|4 guys playing in different rooms at different times and mixed together. Boring background music. No magic. No interactions. I wonder if they even got together? Or did they each mail in their parts?
B000LB7G00|5.0|I bought this one for my desktop and using my smaller one to travel with. Weighs about a pound which is a must so you don't push it around your desk.
B00AEFY66U|3.0|I remember the dreamy scene where Gatsby and Daisy were dancing, but in this version, the music was as if it were played by some ragtime band.
B00A285OOW|5.0|Wonderful story line of what turmoil exited in ending or attempting to end the cousins  war, and Henry the 7ths difficulties in establishing the house of Tudor excellent
B005LAII8A|5.0|interest movie great shipping
0307476464|5.0|I have read this book 2 times and enjoyed it both times immensely and strongly recommend it to all who enjoy a very good read
B007REV4YI|5.0|the new bond is at least exciting
0399255370|5.0|I bought this as a gift for a very bright 4-year-old.  I know she is going to love it!  The story unfolds for each color and encourages the reader to think about each specific color's &#34;complaint.&#34;  The ending is very satisfying and the final double-page illustration allows the reader to see just how the crayons are now being used to their fullest extent.  Great book!
B00DC7N9NS|4.0|I thought is was slow and fell asleep 1/2 way through.  My wife loved the movie and watched through.  I needed more action to keep my interest.
B009IF8CH6|4.0|I've enjoyed watching this show since I happened on the reruns on TBS last year. I've since caught up with all the past seasons. It's not only funny, but also informative. The tidbits that Sheldon drops are fabulous!
B0082RHRHC|5.0|How can one NOT choose this rating.<br />Brought back memories of reading in a tree house as a young kid.
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|An incredible, mystifying, inspiring story of a man who has used up his body for the good and welfare of the deserving innocents.
1781162646|5.0|Really enjoyed Joyland.  Lots of mystery and fun too.  Would recommend it to all King readers.  I read it in one day; could not put it down.
1451695187|3.0|Nothing breathtaking about this book. I have not been able to pick it up and read it voraciously. It may get better once I can commit to sticking with it.
B004UPANAI|5.0|This movie was worth watching. I thought it was better than the 2013 Wolverine movie. Good character developement and plenty of action.
B000B5OD4I|5.0|Wearing it as I write this review. The watch is great. Lume is super bright. Time settled in at around 5 seconds fast per 24 hours. Another quality watch from Seiko
B0077DBZXO|4.0|Puss in Boots is one of the better spinoffs to come out in recent years. Skillfully, with gorgeous animation, colourful characters, and impeccable voice work, the movie tells the untold story of our favourite feline bandito - the one and only Puss...in Boots! Set in sandy deserts, dust-swept towns, and with a distinctive Fistful of Dollars feel, Puss in Boots accomplishes something impressive indeed; being a smart film, entertaining for both kids and adults, with an emotional core that satisfies younger audiences and critics, I call Puss in Boots a success!<br /><br />This is in no small part to the fantastic, detailed, atmospheric, rich world that our characters live in. Thanks no doubt in part to executive producer [[ASIN:B003Y1D7UC Guillermo del Toro's]] practiced eye for atmosphere, lush detail, and stunning cinematography. Watching the movie, one is reminded of Sergio Leone's Man With No Name Trilogy, with several clever nods to famous spaghetti westerns present, and the old Zorro TV shows, including Antonio Banderas' fantastic [[ASIN:B000LY1OA0 The Mask Of Zorro]].<br /><br />But visually is not the only area Puss in Boots succeeds. The voicework is incredibly good. [[ASIN:B002RVCCUQ Zach Galifianakis]] is excellent as the shifty Humpty (Alexander) Dumpty., and [[ASIN:B007HJ9LXE Salma Hayek]] is also impeccable as Kitty Soft-Paws, a literal cat burglar. While the rest of the cast is beyond criticism, the real star (once again) here is [[ASIN:B0048LVDHG Antonio Banderas]], whose silky-smooth, charismatic voice lends great gravitas and charm to the adventure-seeking, boot-wearing, milk-lapping, sword-wielding, fast-talking eponymous Puss in Boots.<br /><br />The story is nothing new or groundbreaking, nor is the movie especially weighty or dramatic, but for kids, and even for adults savvy enough to catch the references, Puss in Boots is an entertaining, action-packed, funny, witty, gorgeously animated adventure! My rating? 4 magic beans out of five.<br /><br />P.S. We! WANT! a sequel...We! WANT! a sequel... We! WA--.S. We! WANT! a sequel...We! WANT! a sequel... We! WA--
0525478817|5.0|This is a fantastic book, the story is very well written and I loved it so much I finished it in a day.
B008TTPQXA|2.0|I found this difficult to follow. Not his life story but the way the events were happening, I think this man had a very deep experience and sometimes it is difficult to put this down to our worldly words
B00003CXCQ|2.0|The movie seems fine when watching it, however, I question if it is actually a Disney produced copy. As the movie is playing, every so often, an image of a video camera appears in the top right corner for a time. I think this might be a boot leg copy because I own tons of Disney movies and this has never happened with them.
B0000669JL|5.0|Thank you so much for the CD this is what i have been waiting for i truely appreciate it thanks
B008UCJ7KO|3.0|Trilogy means three. The way the book ended seems like theres more to the story. I guess we'll just have to wait and see.
0307341550|5.0|I never even imagined I'd come across a novel with a plot like this. I love books that transcend my own imagination and ones that do so so expertly with such great prose impress me even more. This is one of those books.<br /><br />All throughout the book, I found myself dying to know more about the words the main character scratches into her skin. I loved hearing about the personal experiences from her past that stuck with her and shaped her. She is a very realistic character I can be sympathetic towards. I also found myself wanting to know more about the family. This book is a page turner and I found myself quickly devouring each page for its hidden gems of knowledge.<br /><br />Great murder mysteries are ones you can't guess before the killer is revealed. Knowing the killer takes all the fun out of it. If you guess the killer before the end of this book, I will be thoroughly impressed. It's a great plot with great twists and you will always be kept in suspense.<br /><br />Instantly I fell in love with this book, and my desire to read everything Gillian Flynn has ever written has not left me. Initially, I picked this book up at the library, but after reading it, I had to have my own copy, an urge books rarely give me.<br /><br />I would definitely get this book if you want to be entertained with mystery and psychology.
B007W4OZ76|1.0|I needed this application for another app and I still was not able to get it to work, not sure if this app that is the problem or the other app
B001G5ZKZS|5.0|My copy had had notches cut into it but other than that, it was in perfect condition. A great work by the masters of their genre, the extras show their comical side.
B007RQ6WCA|1.0|Was not able to get this app to work on my kindle fire so I down loaded antek explorer and still not able to get it to work
B00B7Y0206|3.0|I was unable to watch the videos all the way through, because the videos kept freezing.<br />The picture quality was very good, and I like the setup.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This is another fine application that was free for my kindle fire and I would recommend it is handy and great
B00992CF6W|5.0|this game is awsome for minecraft fans it may cost alot but still worth it and now with the new update it much better
B008YKGQR4|5.0|This is a nice app for my kindle fire. It was easy to configure and user friendly... Love using it.
B007XHWROK|1.0|This is the s***tiest musician ever it is like listening to a tornado made of s*** for eternity in a s***ty house
B003G4W49C|5.0|Before I finished this book I'd already decided that I wanted to read it again. It's thought provoking but an exciting read. Some of the conversations between the characters leave things implied and unsaid. I like the author bringing the reader into the story as more than a narrator.
B00992CF6W|4.0|It's a really good game, especially the survival. The realms need to be released though. That would be good. The game is awesome ,all in all.
0060245867|3.0|Why would you have a milk mustache if you are using a straw?  There are just a few odd things in this book that make it only 3 stars... liked the idea, though.  Maybe some of the other &#34;If you give... books&#34; are better.
B00AHG3UYA|4.0|This book was a requirement for Summer School, it was very interesting. A must read, especially if you are family orientated.
1490313370|5.0|This is a book everyone needs to read! It's hard to put down and I'm ready to start on the path of happiness! Thank you James for an amazing book.
B0029SCFE0|5.0|An informal part of the &#34;Vengeance Trilogy&#34; this film is excellent as a stand-alone purchase. A Tarentino-esque tale of revenge- this film is much better in its original language, as the dubbed version deviates from the story notably. It is graphic, but I found it was always suitable to the story. There is an American adaptation planned by Spike Lee in the near future. Watch this one first!
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Again an excellent book by Grisham. Suspenseful, exciting and fast paced. You will not put down the book until it is finished.
B00C2VIA52|5.0|this is one of the best games ever and even better it is free and easy to understand and VERY addictive in my opinion so if you aren't sure about getting this game just remember  it's free and loads of fun!!  ( also very addictive )
1574214276|5.0|I really love this book, the completed examples and easy to read instructions had me creating some of the most amazing works of art that I have ever created. I have the door to my office decorated with the Zentangles that I have created most from examples of tangles from this book. I have so many people stopping and asking where I learned to do that or commenting on the fact that they could never do that (the same things I used to say until I got this book and some others) and I show them the book and tell them to get it and they will be doing the same.<br /><br />This is an always carry with me book though my book back is getting rather heavy with all my must carry books and a loaded iPad of kindle books. I get a work out now from all the things I have decided I can't leave home without for those times when I simply must tangle.<br /><br />This is a must have book and such a fun read.
B000FCKC4C|5.0|A simple book with a complex lesson. Paulo Coelho's writing is very dreamy, and I was in the right frame of mind for this book. If it doesn't keep you interest right now, wait (maybe even years), because some day this will be the book for you. Odd, like this book finds you, rather than the other way around.
0062206281|3.0|The shadow of the wind was so strikingly refreshing that the Prisoner of Heaven was a bit of let down but Zafon's narrative still kept me glued to the book. 3 1/2 is more like it. kk
B001CDZZI6|4.0|It's always fun to analyze oneself. This book goes one step further and recommends types of people with whom one should partner. It's obvious that a shy person should partner with an outgoing person; a creative type with a business mind. But it's a good reminder.
B00E5BQ9SW|1.0|The Bluray - \\"Body Double\\" (1984) will be available for sale in Germany, as happened with the Bluray - \\"Blue Lagoon\\" (1980) from Twilight Time, now in Germany the Bluray - \\"Blue Lagoon\\" (1980) it is  from Sony Pictures Home Entertainment, and the title is \\"Die blaue Lagune\\" (1980).<br />It's a matter of time and patience. How about releasing \\"Body Double\\" (1984) - Bluray mastered in 4K with fantastic image quality? That would be great!
B0022Q8CSC|5.0|I am a huge Godfather movie fan, and this book lived up to my expectations. An excellent story. So vivid. I could have done without the sex (just didn't seem necessary), but overall, just excellent.
B0034G4P8A|4.0|Exciting and worth the cost.  Loved the way it captured my imagination and put me in a mood for adventure.
B00B2JSRAS|4.0|I really enjoyed this book.  The exercises were fun and very affirming.  The writing was easy to understand and I know that the readers will enjoy the ideas and truths revealed by this book.
B009DQQE16|5.0|Recommended in France by Parisian stores for beautiful Parisian music. We were gifted with this CD and gave it as a gift, as well. Love the music!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This is a very clear and user friendly edition of the Holy Bible.  It also has great and wonderful videos.
B006LSZECO|5.0|This is such a good read. I could barely put it down to go to work, and it kept me guessing until the end. Will be reading more by this author.
B008K93302|1.0|After downloading this, I think it might be impossible to ever run flash on my Fire.  It was a gift and I probably wouldn't have bought it if I knew this would ne a problem.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This ia an awesome app I have the Pc version but now I can play it wehrevr I go It's awesome.
B000NYT1M6|5.0|This is a huge truck. My grandson loves it. He hauls his tractors around inside the dump body. These toys are super and provide a lot of imagination for play time for my grandson. He loves all these Bruder Toys and they are durable and fun for him. This truck is not quite as large as the Mighty Tonka dump truck he also has, but it is plenty big. My floors are filled with these construction type toys from Bruder.
B00CATSONE|5.0|Excellent facts that are not known to the general public. We know that the very rich didn't become rich by being nice and refused to breaks laws. Tesla would have been very sought after if he was born 100 years later.  What beautiful visions he had. I would recommend this book to be read by all of the educators.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Love this series. The cast and storyline continue to be riveting. Can't wait for season 4! Just begs you to wish you lived during this era in this place.
B00CKJ2KK2|1.0|This game is dum because you join a game then get spawn killed but then get KICKED OFFLINE because &quot;You were idle in the menus&quot; also I tried getting online but is said could not connect and wouldn't let me access my lvl 40 account that I had invested in (I paid some money in the game) also it's kinda hard to play on &quot;Madagascar Volcano&quot; when the map doesn't exist. Thats not even it snipers cam 1 SHOT a stealth player when they can't even see them no matter what. Over all I liked this game until I see a lvl 60 medic with a premium dragon gun that WILL DO 600-700 DMG + 50 DMG OVER TIME. Do not get this game
B00CWY76CC|5.0|A great fun game. Not to difficult and not easy, a great way to spend some free time. I look forward to getting more levels.
B00BMCAM6M|5.0|great app for all music genres FREE - it is easy to work and has everything from classical to jazz to broadway and  contemporary.....
B00COGZ8FU|4.0|Not sure how he never survived to this point in the movie without being hospitalized.  The story line seemed familiar to other movies with the ultimate action coming at the end.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|The game is cool but I don't like to have to keep paying for the acorns for most of the missions. I think it is very unfair.
B00BWJARHO|5.0|Great flow and story line with action scenes.  Then the end of the movie came to an abrupt end that you were not expecting.  You are left with the question, &#34;You are kidding me!&#34;
B003Y74KAW|5.0|Works perfectly, is durable, and remains clean even after several weeks!  If you are looking for a simple, reliable iPhone case, this is the one!
B006C45MRE|5.0|This movie was action packed from the beginning to the end.  They were against impossible odds yet a few rose to the occasion.
B000FBFN1U|5.0|This book will keep you reading on the edge of your seat. Fantastically written, I haven't liked a book so much since the Lord of the Rings
B00992CF6W|5.0|Awesome game.  My kids and I play it a lot, sometimes until the battery dies.  It is totally worth every cent.
0307352153|5.0|I really loved this book. After reading it, it seemed to me that everything had fallen into place. With everything I mean experiences and thoughts and ideas throughout my life. Even after a more deliberate reflection I've the impression of a solid and well written work , though more questions and the need of further investigation of the topic are emerging (of course this being the merit of every good book). Whether or not this book will be the manifesto of a soft revolution towards a more inclusive and respectful world, it undoubtedly remains  a recommended reading for  everyone interested in a deeper understanding of the introversion/extroversion dichotomy and of the importance of a cultural and social approach to these topic.
B0064X7FVE|3.0|I liked the old version much better because the was not all that sign up JUNK. All I want is the weather...
B005GRTNXC|5.0|She has a very beautiful voice with a great range.  I enjoy her music and will for along time...its transcends many genres of music and you can feel assured its worth listening too.
B005FITIGO|5.0|All I can say is WOW!! This is a must see for those that follow the exploits of greedy, dysfunctional and infantile powers that be that have driven this country into the abyss. Well worth the price and well worth sharing with others.
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|This was the best addictive game and I totally loved it then I too had the update problem and now have even tried reuploading the game which erases my game status and it still will not open the game. Just keeps saying to download the update then the update does nothing. You get stuck in a loop of trying to update. Making me very mad. Someone please fix this. I love this game!!!!!
B00BVYLBP2|5.0|The female actress is incredible. So many layers and affectations one forgets its the same person. I just happened opinion this, became instantly addicted. Everyone I told about also became addicted. This is a truly well done series. And intense!
B004FV1ESW|4.0|The Town had a great story line, great actors and they did a great job; my only problem with most of today's movies is the &#34;F&#34; bomb.  I feel like this would have been just as good of a movie with only one, two or even none.<br />If a movie is done well it can support itself without the toilet mouthing.
B00992CF6W|5.0|this app is full of adventures and tons more fun and entertaining futures amazing is one word to discribe it
B005LAII4E|4.0|I have talked to so many people that liked the movie only. and the reason was because all the original actors were gone and Tatum lasted only about 5 minutes.  If you're going to do a sequel then do it right.  Keep the main characters.
B009MYARIK|4.0|Sophie Kinsella is one of my favorite authors for light reads. I laughed out loud numerous times while reading this book! While I agree with others that it may not be her best, it was a fun book worth reading. I actually enjoyed the different character viewpoints!
B003Q6D2BE|5.0|Great acting, great fun.  I thought it was very well done and believable.  I felt the actors were  chosen quite well.
B0000041WV|4.0|These are fresh lively performances by a conductor who passed away too young. New insights can be found in these performances. The London Symphony plays well but the czech flavor is missing.Listento a recording with the Czech Philamonic. Those woodwinds essential in dvorak. No one has success with all 9 symphonies but this set is recomended. Sound good but not as smooth as the LP several years ago. A good bargain none the less.
B00B7Y0206|4.0|The videos are clear and the layout is good.  My only problem was logging onto my Google account.  I haven't been able to retrieve my password for some reason.
B008XKSW7M|4.0|Lots of laughs and also unexpected tears.  I enjoyed the humor coupled with the truth of pregnancy and parenthood.  Great cast!!
B009DCOU9S|1.0|I was difficult to find some items.  The clues weren't helpful.  I usually good with hidden pics but did not get this one at all.  Found the box but could not locate the key.
B003QP2TW8|5.0|For what he had to work with in this Jane Austin story, Rupert Penry and Sally Hawkins rose to the task and made this story one I will watch again. The former works were way too stiff, Anthony Head's character usually missed my attention, I don't know whether to applaud him or boo him. I didn't fall asleep on this one. This version will have a place in my bookcase along with my other Jane Austin collectables.
1451695195|5.0|THIS BOOK ALSO WAS A GREAT BOOK, I LOST MY DAUGHTER TO CANCER AND I HAVE STRONG FAITH BUT THIS BOOK STILL HELPED ME.
B00BMR5HOO|4.0|I love to check my Kindle Fire for the weather every day,  I usually miss it when it's. On. So now I have it at my convience.
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|I've been waiting a  long time for someone to explain quantum physics so that I could understand. This books time has come. I am truly enjoying it and have ordered two, one to share.
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|E-squared is a fun book that was a quick easy read. It is a book that everyone can benefit from reading.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is wonderful. Totally addictive and fun to play for hours. Kind of laggy at times though. But overall a great game.
B00BAYLQI0|2.0|This is a 2 hour piano cantata focussed on the female lead.  The disaster scenes are impressive but not enough to make the film worth the journey.
B009XIXVU6|4.0|The description of the locales as well as the characters was like reading poetry. Hosseini has a beautiful gift of language that he shares with the reader.
B007FEFLTO|4.0|I liked this book because it made the attitudes of people in England, Russia, Spain and Germany prior to WW II more understandable to me.
B000FP2Z0S|5.0|No matter how many times I listen to this cd I am still in love with it.  I am not such a big fan of their more recent releases but this one has well put together, melodic songs that still have enough of Rise Against's former kick that it is a perfect balance of theater and garage.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway surfers is the best game ever I just got 4379 coins using 5 keys can any body beat that
B00BIVN82M|3.0|I  have been a fan since before more than a few hundred people even who Buble was.  I adore him and his musical stylings.  But this latest album is my least favorite of everything he's released.  It's still quite enjoyable but I'm not a big fan of some of his original pop songs.  I wish he'd stick to the classics.....or write better original music like his first &#34;Home.&#34;
B0066W1AZK|1.0|I don't really care for this game. The board does not respond to the tap of your finger when it should and often times the pieces will not move.
B000SO7OL6|5.0|Diana Krall puts her jazzy spin on the classic American songbook.  I get transported to a happy place when listening to her sing and play the piano so masterfully.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|This is a great heart warming story. I recommend it for everyone to read.  The start is kind of slow though... BUT KEEP READING.
0375413405|5.0|Wonderful recipes, makes me feel like a real cook, easy to follow and understand. I have been cooking for 50 years and would recommend this book to a new cook.
1451648537|5.0|I was not a Jobs/Apple fan, I'm not a techie, I am four days younger than Jobs, this book is great. If you're a techie go look somewhere else. If you want a great read about a guy who was nuts, driven, unsure, bombastic, sensitive, insensitive, sad, driven and basically honest, except when it came to getting what he wanted, you 'll like this book. I had taken it out of the library, but after starting it I bought it. I'm glad I did.
0061997811|5.0|My 10 year old daughter is in love with this book. She has limited herself to a couple of pages each because she doesn't want to finish it.
B007IXWKUK|4.0|I really enjoyed the series, but at times i found myself annoyed with the character Ana she just seemed so pathetic at times.
B00D6BQPMM|5.0|Really enjoyed this flick and I am not a zombie movie fanatic, in fact I am just the opposite and typically have nightmares for weeks. This is a cute twist on the zombie phenomenon that will make you laugh for sure
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I tried the doors of revenge and HATED it. This game is challenging but fun. Not so difficult I get frustrated and quit. Try it out!
B007SGM084|4.0|I enjoyed the trilogy it was easy, fast paced, brain candy fluff.  By the way all the obvious applies, this is not a book to read to the kiddies.
0385347774|2.0|Very boring novel.  Too much back & forth relative to past history of characters and guess I'm not a diary reading person.
0007477155|5.0|These books came in a perfect set, with the map and all. Shipped really fast, too! Good price, and well worth.
6305736650|5.0|Love it.  Just as I remembered it and much better than the &#34;tape&#34; I had previously.<br />Also it was packaged just right and arrived quickly.
0785153942|5.0|I was fanatically looking forward to Pacific Rim and this gave a good introduction to the universe. The book came in perfect condition and as the title of this review states, you'll enjoy the book if you liked the movie & concept.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|OK ... maybe that's a bit extreme, but I do LOVE playing Draw Something!!  My brother introduced me to this great app and now I'm playing it with a friend in Georgia as well!  Lots of fun and a great diversion ... I highly recommend it!
1476734941|5.0|the FastDiet is easy to read and the best part easier to apply to my life style - it is worth trying.
B00CLZ48FA|5.0|GREAT movie!  I love the Wizard of Oz, so I wasn't sure how I would like this movie. The graphics with the flowers, the plants, the butterflies when he goes to Oz is wonderful.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|THIS IS AN AWESOME GAME!!!!!!! I would tell anyone this is THE game to get. Anyone who likes the movie should get this!!!!!
B00DP3IGJ6|5.0|Action-packed movie, good entertainment on a Friday night with a bowl of popcorn. You guessed it, I really liked this movie.
B00B8M4IMK|4.0|In my car, I usually had to switch adapters to meet the charging specs. for the Android phone, and also for the iPhone. This dual-plug accessory plug has two USB ports, labeled appropriately (tiny type). The adapter works just as described. I use it with the Apple adapter for my iPhone and the Mediabridge USB Charging Cable for an Android phone.
B007MB5OCE|5.0|I was browsing New books, and began reading the sample pages. It struck something in me, and I Had to read it!<br /><br />The 100-Year-Old-Man is totally out of the genre of books I normally read. This book is very well written, funny as can be, and I Extremely Entertaining!!<br /><br />I consider it to be an instant favorite, and recommend it to anyone!!<br /><br />Mr. Jonasson really can spin a tale! At times, I found myself laughing out loud!!
B00A27X972|4.0|I enjoyed this book.  it is well written and tells an entertaining story.  However, I was a little disappointed as the other reviews I read before buying this book led me to believe that it contained some deep insights in to the human condition and really seemed to move other readers.  I did not make that connection with the story.  In fact, I ended up feeling less optimistic about humanity after reading  the book.  I felt like the message was &#34;humans suck but that makes them great&#34; :).  I just got stuck in the &#34;humans suck&#34; part.  Anyhow, I still enjoyed the book, I was just disappointed because I wasn't moved by it like some other readers seemed to be.
0439023483|5.0|GREAT PURCHASE!<br />MY DAUGHTER LOVED THE BOOK! BRAND NEW & PERFECT CONDITION, WHAT A BUY :)<br />VERY HAPPY WITH THIS ITEM.....
B0034DGPEU|5.0|An easy read.  Great story line and great descriptions of the people .  Although I've read similar books about the old South.  Read it for a book club.
0307730700|5.0|This book I read so quickly. The story is captivating and intriguing and I felt that I was offered a glimpse of the secrecy that is kept within our Special Naval forces. it also gave me a look into the life of the family of a navy seal. Adam's story is also very impressive. He is an inspiring man and this book touches straight to the heart.
B002KQ6BT6|5.0|What an in lighting read.  Gets one think inking.  Plus drama, suspense as usual, full of emotion!  You must read The Lost Symbol.
B005UG542S|5.0|Excellent.  Streamed perfectly.  A perfect experience of a perfect movie!  I think this movie is a downright achievement from start to finish.
B007SYWFRM|1.0|this game was great until after my son played for a couple weeks and I spent a lot of money because trust to build a good village this game definately takes some money well after reaching level 30 something the game crashed and went back to the beginning lost village and all money spent to build it and it has been 5 days and still now resolution from gameloft so know I will be warry of all gameloft games
B00871C09S|5.0|Grace Kelly is beautiful in this movie. Jimmy Stewart plays a great roll as the neighborhood snoop, and Raymond Burr is also in this one. It kept us watching from the start. A real classic.
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|Do you remember how clear your perspective was as a child? Did you ever promise yourself that when you were a grownup you'd behave differently?<br /><br />Neil Gaiman captures the loss of those resolves in &#34;The Ocean at the End of the Lane: A Novel.&#34; It was almost too readable - I found myself gobbling it like popcorn while I was wanting to savor it like wine. An excellent read.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Enjoyed the reading pop culture great on the kindle and easy to read.  I don't know if I'd read again but glad I did the first time.
B008JFUTT0|5.0|the dvd is to be sent as a gift and im sure the person receiveing it will enjoy it very much
B00B5ARKDE|5.0|The movie was delivered in 1 day (although quoted 2 days) and it was as pictured with the little mini fig. The kids love the movie!
B00985E3UG|5.0|I love this book! I tell all my friends about it! I have avoided these. Not gone hungry at all and<br />lost, since April, 17 pounds. About a pound a week. I don't eat wheat either. No bread or pasta or<br />pizza or desserts. My sweets are fresh fruits. I feel so much better!
B004I8WD7S|5.0|Fantastic price and has protected my phone after 7 months from getting a single scratch. I've dropped it on all surfaces accidently and it doesn't have a scratch. This case protects the iphone 4s from all sides and leaves all the features fully accessible.
B0083Z6AH6|4.0|I look for more good work by this promising writer, though I would like to see her tackle next time something a little more current than this period drama.
B00BIVN82M|5.0|Buble does excellent job on this new release. The original songs<br />always better than his cover songs. Definate must buy.
B00867GJYK|4.0|My daughter really likes this movie.  At first, she found it scary, but after one viewing she was fine with it.  At 100 minutes in length, she does find it a bit long.  She is 3.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|Amazing book you should read it.  You should also read percy Jackson series. But Egyptian sucks so don't read it
5551369242|5.0|Quick Delivery and &#34;Like New Condition&#34;, as advertised. This book, unfortunately, has been out of print for some time because of some controversy with the story, &#34;Rage&#34;. I finally found it in hardcover, and the price was more than fair for such a rare book in this condition.
B00A6RCSKC|5.0|This pack even comes with Free heroes and extra specials for in game use and it's completely portable for whenever you're bored!.
B005DF2QMC|3.0|This usb portable cassette tape to MP3 is not easy to figure out how to use with a mac. computer. Even though you can find information on how to convert it to a mac.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I Played It And I Was Happy When I Got It I Checked The Reviews And Then I Downloade It #LoveTheMinions
B000002KKC|5.0|Loved this album when it came out despite the numerous pans. Really shows Lindsey's brilliance and is great to revisit over 30 years later. Geez...did I just say that?
B008XBHIEY|5.0|A quality version of the movie that I love so much. I recommend the download! Ba dum, ba dum, dum dum dum
B00DHSK3RM|5.0|This app is easy to use and easy to run updates. The app works on all kinds of phones and tech pads.
B00CW7KK9K|1.0|I'm disappointed. I have and love my fitbit one, but I hoped the pulse would allow me to replace that and my Polar HRM with one device. Not so much. First the good, I have a Withings scale so already had the app and setup was a breeze. It comes very close to the fitbit in calculating steps and distance, so I assume that's correct. The form factor is nice, and everything seems sturdy. Now the bad, the Heart rate is wildly inaccurate. When I'm sitting calmly it seems fine, but during exercise it only registered about 50% of the time, the other half just displayed an X. And the 50% where I got a number, the number was never even close, it was ranged from half what my HRM showed to double. And it's almost impossible to read outdoors (the fitbit is also bad in direct sunlight, but this is worse)So it looks like I'm still wearing a Polar chest strap for a while. I had high hopes for this, I like the brand, but the Pulse is just not ready for release.
0061537969|4.0|My bookclub enjoyed it...We like something like it for summer with so much going on.  It kept our interest and the discussion was very good.  One of our group won't read anything where dogs or critters die so we knew that going in.
0634022296|4.0|Great for guitarists or keyboardist who just want the lyrics and chords without music.  Portable.  Would be nice if it came in a ring type binder rather than a traditional book binding.
B006YG9HJE|5.0|Here in Brazil only the first season aired on channel warner, so I decided to buy the second season on Amazon and liked it a lot. Already up with audio in Portuguese. I hope that the third season has already dubbing in Portuguese too, because I'm crazy to buy.
B00190OHD6|5.0|This is the best story of amazing love, loss, and moving on with life. No matter how many times I watch it, I always start to cry. Love this movie!
B009H7SCMA|5.0|This is an amusing account of English summers filled with cricket and frolicking.<br />Gabriella, the heroine, is an out and out snob as well as being fully aware of the effect her beauty and body has on those around her. She enjoys being the centre of attention as well as the focus for school boys and their sexual curiosity.<br />The novel reads like a bawdy account of a school cricket match punctuated by naughty exploitations using innuendo and metaphor in a highly amusing fashion to create a P.G. Wodehouse-style of book.<br />Very funny!
B003ODIZL6|5.0|Good logging high high school greenhouse shrub fish tech tech gibson hasn't Urdu berg centre Hahn hobby high Grubb have
B0062NAX1U|5.0|This movie is a good one. Excellent for the family and a great message to encourage active fathers. We showed it to all our children.
B002PEP4U0|5.0|This book was a required read for my Community Psychology, we went to Mangochi, Malawi and I did my senior project there. It gives you a wonderful insight to how it is in Malawi. I talked to people in the village that I was near about the drought he talks about and it was true, and devastating for them as well. This book is definitely easy to read and many times it brought tears to my eyes. I would definitely read this book again, and I suggest this book to everyone because everyone should be aware of how different it is.
B004RJMUJO|5.0|Wow. Don't quit understand the entire game. Everytime it is played others want to join in. It is definitely one of the most exciting games to play
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Easy to use, this calculator remembers your last calculation. It fills the entire screen and its buttons are large. Highly recommended.
B001AQO3QA|5.0|This box set is the standard bearer for all other anthology/trilogy/etc. sets.  The content is incredible and the packaging is sturdy and beautiful.
B00CJCHJ8S|5.0|While all the original albums all had gems all to themselves , this monumental box deserves kudos for pulling it all together , and discovering even more.<br />I am a Nilsson fan who respects major elements of all of his albums...True , not every album is 5 star , but each has it's own unique appeal and moments of greatness.<br />And although I , of course , own all those original releases , I had to buy the box.<br />What makes this box so enjoyable are all of the bonus tracks , and three additional discs of rarities. Stripped down versions of some classics , demos of others , radio spots , and everything but the kitchen sink appears here.<br />Another unique appeal of Harry was not only was he a GREAT songwriter himself (\\"1941\\" , \\"Ten Little Indians\\" ,\\"Spaceman\\" , \\"Coconut\\" , etc.etc.) , but his recordings of other writer's songs , show that he had the knowledge to know what makes a great song (Badfinger's \\"Without You\\" , George Harisson's \\"That Is All\\" , a full album plus of Randy Newman , etc .etc)<br />Drop the very reasonable asking price for this box and immerse yourself in pure audio genius.
1478951508|1.0|Its was boring and a huge let down. I think rowling should not write if shes not goig to try.its not like she needs the money... Just a huge let down no where near as good as harry potter
B00336G7HI|1.0|Unfortunately, this battery did not fit into my camera because the number did not match the one for the camera which should have been NP-FH50.  I was not aware until I opened it and tried to insert it in the camera.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|You can't help but wonder about the future when you see this movie acted so seamlessly and with great conviction. No, I did not read the books but the movie intrigues me enough to want to read the whole series. Not since reading Animal Farm in Middle School am I this disturbed about children 'playing alone.' But then it's the adult supervision that seems to have put them in this predicament. You see, twisted, but oh so good just like the movie.
0061450162|3.0|I'm sure some readers will really enjoyed these stories, but they're not what I had hoped for. Not for me.
B008FYZIVY|4.0|I bough all 3. 1,2 and 3.  Can't wait for four.  It was easy to get hooked on watching These
B00AEFY5TI|5.0|One of my all time favorite movies!<br />The best Olivia and John movie!<br />I wish they would have made movies together and they definately have chemistry!
141694737X|4.0|This book is ideal for 3-4 year olds.  They will want you to read it again and again. Love pull tabs
B000YABYLA|5.0|A great movie! The movie is full of laughter and a few tears.<br />Perfectly acted! My favorite Ellen Page flick.
B000JMKQX0|3.0|It's a good book, but the structure of the book it's not what I was expecting. Anyway it's  good to spend some time, and has a different approach to zombies. I recommend reading the sample first.
1878424319|5.0|This book was a much needed book.......... years ago!  I purchased two more for my daughters, and they also liked.
B00280LYIC|5.0|I have been reading these books all over every year right before the new ones comes out and have never gotten bored with them.
0812550706|4.0|This past March Out of Print had their annual March Madness for best titles and this year the genre was fantasy/sci-fi. I was a bit perturbed when, for some time, Ender's Game was ahead of The Hobbit. Surely you jest internet. Who was voting in this??<br /><br />But don't worry, wisdom won out and The Hobbit made it to the Final Four (only to lose to Harry Potter). I was ready to have someone hold my earrings. So I took it upon myself to pick up a copy and see what the fuss was all about, since, I'm scared to admit, I'd never heard of Ender before. And if it put up a fight against my beloved Tolkien, then I needed to study the enemy.<br /><br />My first thought after finishing this book was, why did the aliens have to be called Buggers? My second thought was that I didn't expect that ending! I kept trying to think of ways it was going to end as I drew closer and closer to the finish, but I can honestly say I wouldn't have called that one.<br /><br />I thought, for me to like this, it would have required a much different crazy non-stop ending, but if anything, it made me enjoy the book more. I had some pretty high expectations (you win awards, you better wow me) and as lame as this is going to sound, I was hoping it would be terrible so my Hobbit love would have been justified. I know, issues folks.<br /><br />So even though it was a bit different than I was expecting, I still enjoyed it. It leaves you with some life lessons and if you love sci-fi, I think you'll enjoy this one. One more thought, I kinda felt bad for Ender. Anyone else feel me on that?
B007BVMVDU|5.0|So fantastic, every episode is like watching a movie.  The characters are amazing and I love the story lines!  x
B004JN1D2I|5.0|Love the show but the books are even better.I recommend this to anyone that loves the series or just likes fantasy books.
B00932A66Y|5.0|Good flick, highly recommend. Not sure if the lead is good or bad, but found myself rooting for him anyways.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|It was a great movie with a suprising ending.  You'll love it,  You can't beat Nicholas Sparks for a great story line.
B00B7PIRIE|5.0|Love Downton Abbey. Great set of DVD's. If you are a fan I would buy this set. Waiting for season four.
B006LSZECO|5.0|You will not be able to put this book down. Wonderfully written and suspenseful. It shows such different points of view of the main characters and leaves you wondering where the truth lies. A must read!
B00DCX08MW|3.0|I really enjoy WWII planes since that is the era in which I grew up and I have flying experience, however this program, with excellent graphics, is lacking in controlling the aircraft. Maybe I am not experienced enough with the Kindle Fire or I-Pad that is used to fly with this program. Hope that makes sense. But I really am a fan of the F4U airplane.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I can't stop playing this game. I love all the mini games. That is what makes this game better then others!
B00D37UQ1K|1.0|I read the book cover to cover.  The movie left out the feeling of wanting to cheer Melanie on for me.  I know that with cinematic form, everything was not going to transfer over from the literature but I expected much more from this movie.  You had to read the book in order to follow the movie, but the movie left out vital parts to keep you interested.
1451695187|5.0|Ordered this book which was highly recommended by Andrea Tantaros of The Five.  Also ordered additional copies for my family and friends.  A fantastic and inspiring read.  My neighbor, who had been in a coma for four days concurred with the books message.  I highly recommend this book to anyone open to faith.
B001NLL93W|5.0|This has been an extraordinary series thus far!  I can not say enough good things about this serious.  If you are looking for an escape from reality and into a world full of mystery and suspense, this definitely the book for you!
B008JFUO4U|5.0|I am not one to write reviews of movies that try to emulate professionals critics.  I just write about what I like.  Tom Cruise has not been one of my favorites in the past, but he played a great role in this movie, as did everyone else in the movie.  This is a great, not good, great science fiction movie in my humble opinion.  The effects were great, scenery was amazing, and the story was damn good.  As usual with A list movies, there was great production values (lighting, cutting, music, dialog, etc.) and honestly, this story was intriguing and very interesting.  If you like good Sci-Fi, you will like this movie.
030746363X|5.0|I first looked at this book 6 mos ago, and didn't think much of it.  Since then many people have told me their success stories, including my trainer who used the 'slow carb diet' along with his girlfriend.  They were both in shape to begin with, and both lost 15lbs.  I'm in shape to begin with, but need help losing the last few lbs. While I've lost bodyfat, my mother who has 50+ lbs to lose is on her way to significant weight loss and a healthier eating plan.<br /><br />The diet is hard for the first couple of days, especially eating more beans, etc. than I wanted to in the morning (important to eat more, not less).  Once I effectively forced myself to eat larger breakfasts and lunches I have been happy with my energy level and I definitely notice myself not missing snack foods and fruits like I thought I would.  I highly recommend the slow carb diet and kettlebell swings!
B00A80SHFM|3.0|I give this three stars because it is a good soundtrack from the movie, but it is missing some key songs from the film.  I guess I should have known this before buying, but it is odd that they would leave some of these songs out.  I would think that they would make it a two disc set in order to have the whole score in one album.  The digital version has all of the songs so I recommend buying that instead.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This has become one of my favorite games. It's a lot of fun trying to figure out how to open the door. You travel into several areas and look for objects to use to open up other clues. The only possible negative is the same music over and over, but this can easily be turned off. It's hard for me to put this one down. I highly recommend it!
B00DHKKN6Q|5.0|Very fun twist to the regular bubble type games. Very addicting and fun. Only doing the review to collect more coins. X)
B00821OX98|5.0|After \\"V\\" got cancelled , I was hoping for good alien surviving show. This one fill the blanks. Worth watching. Keep it coming.
B005ZCXPP0|5.0|I have never really been into Marvel comics- anything. This movie was very entertaining. Now that my boys are getting older I let them watch it and they loved it. Its a good change from cartoons to a &#34;realistic&#34; movie. Great movie!
B000I8JEY2|5.0|Will Smith and Martin Lawrence makes a grea team in this movie,  I loved the work Will Smith did even though Martin is my Favorite, I think Will is the man
B007IXWL2C|4.0|After wading thru all the XXX rated story to get to the plot I've finally finished the book. The story about Christian was good. Just wish the story was longer and the sex scenes shorter. Just glad I didn't buy the trilogy but borrowed from the library. Hooray for the OverDrive app.
B00A8MGIZG|5.0|What an amazing story of connection across time, resonance of love, despair, hate, condescension. Adds to the experience of having read the book (deepens the story even as it changes the story). My favorite movie of 2012.
B00158SZ1M|1.0|I was  sent  a did they doesn't  play  in the  US even  though my  address obviously showed a US address. And  no where  in  the  description informed  me  that the  dvd wouldn't  play in  my region.
0767827791|2.0|This is pan & scan not a restored widescreen version. Amazon should remove the word restored. I sent my copy back to Movie Mars and explained this to them. I also bought the widescreen version that is also available on Amazon. Check the aspect ratio before your order. Holden and Novak are like two roses in a garden.
B00E9WTI1W|5.0|I think this is his best album ever l have putchased it when it first came out on LP back the 1960 and again on Cd in the 1990 ,and again when I got a Kindle fire in 2013
B00377V6IS|4.0|I'm not totally a fan of death metal music but when it comes to anything that shows any sign of so-to-say &#34;progress&#34;, I'm in! The album is very conceptual and thematic, with an appreciable balance between brutal showcasing and interludial melodies. Incredible musicianship, in my opinion, ultimately when it comes down to the songwriting! If you're not a fan of heavy music, this may not be for you, but it's an amazing listen if you intimately love music!
B009IJJ5B4|5.0|I wish I had watched it when it was on TV.  This is a great show.  I am hooked and need to buy the whole season.
B00005B36H|5.0|I consider this entire album a masterpiece! It's artsy, intimate, experimental, and beautifully woven to please! It's layered with so much sonic and thematic flavors that your ears will become diabetic! No, seriously, I'd think even to a casual listener the songs show its greatness from the aural imagery found in Reflection or Triad to the melodic movements found in Schism, The Patient, or Lateralus! These four musicians know exactly what art is!
B00005NKK8|5.0|This double disc soundtrack has always been a stable in my collection.  I wore it out and had to replace it, it is so good.  Great all american classic jams that span the decades just like the movie.
B006GWO5NE|4.0|I got the kindle micro usb cable just yesterday ( thursday). i ordered it on Sunday. So far...it works! Charging is good. It looks like new. Wire is not damaged or worn out at all like my previous one.  Lets hope  this one lasts!
B000J103YI|5.0|I love this soundtrack I play it a lot on hard days and long commutes.  Great movie and the soundtrack is above par.
B00AEBB8BU|4.0|Interesting espionage filmed in NYC. This film is out of the low-tech era and was complemented by a conspiracy plot that fits the CIA during the height of it time.
B008CFN95I|4.0|Appealing to both adults and children alike, this book has a real charm that is hard to resist. A bibliophile's fairytale
B003WUYRGI|3.0|Well for starters this dictionary doesn't have a search page for words , if I can't find it by sliding the bar on the screen.<br />Another reason is that it could be alphabetized to find the word your looking for. Other than that it was very good and a good resource.<br /><br />The masked results
B006GWO5NE|5.0|This was a replacement sent to me from Amazon when they replaced my charger. I did not know the charger didn't include the cable.
B000VMFDW2|5.0|Sledge takes you on his journey  through hell. Required reading for anyone who has a fascination with history at.  Personal level. Sledge is able to use all your senses to put you on the battlefield.
140006922X|5.0|You'll never read the New Testament the same way again, or be tempted to take the bible literally. It is an excellent view of the socio-economics of Judea that Jesus was born into, and a look at the grinding poverty all around him. I have a masters degree in theology, but this is a point of view I never got to grasp; both of Paul, and of Peter. Don't pass this book up if you want to understand the early church, or the significance of Jesus.
B00C4GRGQY|5.0|I follow Neil van Niekerk's fantastic blog and I enjoy his style of writing and teaching.<br />Practical, down to earth and simple on a subject that is not easy to get across. :)<br />Super book.
B00BC5I6Q2|5.0|One of the best new shows in a long time.  Up there with Mad Med and Breaking Bad.  Good job Netflix.
B0096BIENY|2.0|I chose this rating because they are very talented.  I guess I was expecting a lot more English singing.  Beautiful, but aggravated me, because a lot of the songs were not in English.  But, I ordered the wrong one.
B00785P2QC|4.0|Fun game but dont know what im striving to in the game. Need a better intro layout to thr whole game.  Transportation.  Housing.  Etc.
B004I2K4DY|5.0|Les Miserables is one of the few shows I have seen multiple times.  I have seen over 200 plays and rarely go back a second time.  This concert is breathtaking.  It felt new and fresh.  Amazing performances by all!
B007IXWL2C|3.0|I liked it but it was redundant in the fact they kept needing reassurance from the other in regards to commitment in the relationship.<br /><br />I liked the \\"Meeting Fifty\\" epilogue which is written from Christian's pov. I wish the series had been written this way Anastasia is just so blah to me.
B004GHNIRK|3.0|I really  can't rate this book because It didn't hold my interest.  So it wouldn't be fair to rate it because I didn't finish it.
B00BJA2VFW|4.0|Like this game but I do not like having to link into amason after buying an app.please correct this problem.
B00DRPVE3M|5.0|I love this game! So addictive!! Can't wait to do the scratch offs so I can play more!  Will be telling others!
B004UNX1LS|1.0|I tried too leave an opinion for you , but some idiot  stoped me from doing it. I was  trying to express my feeling about  how I hate face book sing in. I really,wanted to ,use your app, but facebook won't let me sign in. That ok I find another way to see music videos. I'm not going too give you any stars, because I'm been keep from using your app.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Love having to scan, move and remember sequences etc in order to move to next level. Wish there were more floors
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|Great game full of excitement and mystery love the game and it's entirety. I recommend everyone get this fun and addictive game.
B007QVLKI2|5.0|Wow. I'm completely in love with this entire album. Every song really speaks to your heart. Definitely a must have!
B005KQVDH8|5.0|This is a flashback to childhood in a new format. I haven't had a lot of time to look through the special features, but I am not disappointed by my purchase.
B0057R5XRG|5.0|I will not review the movies (you can find those elsewhere); I will review the product itself.<br /><br />  The Blu-rays come in a fold-out case, which is inside a slip-on case. Behind each of the black-colored Blu-ray is a mixture of scenes from the movie it holds. Also inside the case, with the discs, is a paper with the words ULTRAVIOLET on it. DO NOT THROW THIS AWAY!!! This paper has your codes to put the films on iTunes, Windows Media Player, Flixster, etc. For those who have a Blu-ray player, it is WELL worth the fifteen dollars or so extra to get the digital film codes.<br />  Excellent collection, with amazing HD picture! A must-have for Jurassic Park fans and Blu-ray owners!
B005C0DHEY|1.0|I thought documentary was suppose to be about reporting facts.  This film took half truths and cherry picked facts to support one-sided view.  IMO this film is very mis-leading.
B002TLSSXO|5.0|You never have to worry about making a mess on your stove or countertop again. When you set them down the handle automatically rest on countertop and the other end is raised. I love the feel, the weight, and the look. The only thing I regret is that I didn't buy the stand that goes with them.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|I gave this book 5 stars....great on the edge of your seat &#34;love story&#34;. It definitely had its extreme ups and downs which made the book so very hard to put down.
B009AMANBA|1.0|WHAT A HORRIBLE BETRAYAL OF SUCH AN IMPORTANT PART OF OUT HISTORY<br /><br />I QUESTION THE ACCURACY<br />I DON'T RECOMEND THIS ONE<br />GO TO THE LIBRARY
B001AQQR2S|4.0|My nephew just finished as a stage manager for Matilda and now I see what he had to do. Very entertaining.
B00338QENI|5.0|The story of Henrietta Lacks and her immortal cancer cells is a wonderful combination of science and human interest.  Rebecca Skloot skillfully brought Henrietta's story to life while educating the reader on the science behind her cells.  The author also details the lives of Henrietta's children and how they struggled with a lack of knowledge and understanding of what exactly happened to their mother and her cells.  I highly recommend this book!!!  It's a story that everyone should know about!
B00B8WXFWE|4.0|I was expecting more upbeat music. The songs are very nice but mostly slower music; not dance music, for the exception of 2 or 3 songs. Not a bad CD at all. Just depends what you're looking for. Not one that I'd play poolside unless you are looking for mostly softer music.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|Wonderful application the I use weekly, saved me a few times.. very good. Something that works over a variety of platforms and operating systems.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I like Mincraft pe, I wish they put portals and other mobs Like enderman<br />I love playing online with my family members.
B00DP3IESY|3.0|Got a rainy day and nothing to do. Watch it.  But don't plan to engage your intellect.  Plot is obvious and the flashbacks are distracting...
B0055PGUYU|4.0|Great book. Easy enjoyable reading with some life changing ideas. Would recommend to thoughtful friends. Bought on Kindle and wish I could pass it on to others from my Kindle.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|i have enjoyed this game better then the first one because the graphics are better and the game is more challenging.
B00ATDOVNK|4.0|Lots of fun. Enjoyed the games between tasks. Thank goodness for the help button. I used it slot to figure out which way to go. Would recommend this one
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|CAUTION, this terrific game is highly addictive. Much worse than angry birds. Don't download unless you have lots of time to waste. It has many levels and challenges to keep you going forever. It takes a while to become proficient. When you do you will get a lot of air time. Great game for the Kindle Fire HD!! Excellent graphics & audio.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|At the higher levels there is a lot of pre planning needed seemed like a simple game but as you get upwards the fun really begins!
B006PKV2QU|4.0|Another very cute story!  My son loved the dragon and the blob. :)  It is to cute that it rhymes through out most of the book.  The pictures really help to tell the story and I suggest this to anyone.  Great for kids and parents to read together.
B002T9H2ME|1.0|I had read the reviews, and I wasn't expecting an action movie. I was looking forward to some good science fiction though. What I got was a really boring movie, not worth spending two hours with. It is extremely low budget, amateurish, and poorly done. I've read science fiction since the 1960's. There is a lot of really good stuff available. This wouldn't fit into that category.<br /><br />Since it was a \\"movie and popcorn\\" afternoon, we took the DVD out of the player, and put in another movie That was the best choice of the day. My advice for those looking at this DVD is look for another movie.
B001KWP54S|5.0|WWonder what would happen if you combined<br />Blues and Rock?  In this album, you get A heavenly sound of rock and roll .  The Angels would approve.
B00B1R8TCM|5.0|It's ridiculous how many genres Ben Harper can play, and they're all great! The countries in your bones but the cities in your hips.

B00915G6WQ|5.0|I chose 5 stars because this order met my expectations. The order came quickly and no later than I had anticipated. The quality of the discs were all great. I would recommend it to anyone who is a fan of the show.
B00BGIC2J2|5.0|This movie is hilarious!  The relationship between the two main characters is really believable, and the acting is great as well. I would recommend this movie!  It is definitely not for kids though!
B009K0P10K|5.0|Just the perfect mixture of betrayal, lying, cheating and stealing set in the Hamptons and New York to keep my interest!<br />Love the gorgeous clothing and fancy well decorated houses as well!
B00BBQXQFI|4.0|My son loved this movie.  I liked the premise, and the characters are pretty cool.  Good voicing choices as well.
B007URVZJ6|5.0|This book help me build my first kindle book.<br />Excellent  step by step book for beginners and advanced kindle publishers.

B008BQ8VOC|5.0|Fell in love with season 1 and now I'm hooked on 2, can't wait to watch season 3.  Keep it coming!
B0013TXA5Y|4.0|Clary Fray learns of a world beyond the mundane in Cassandra Clare's City of Bones.<br /><br />Clare creates her world within a world starting in New York City. I enjoyed the different paranormal creatures she uses from vampires to werewolves to warlocks. The world building weaves the normal with the extraordinary. The history of the Shadowhunters fascinated me, and I would like to learn more about them.<br /><br />The plot went about at a steady pace, although at times I thought the writing, although beautiful, was a tad overwritten and could've been snappier in places. Readers of Harry Potter will notice some similarities, but City of Bones has its many differences to make it its own story.<br /><br />I had a hard time connecting with Clary, the main character at first, because she seemed a bit spacey and unfocused on the dangers of the situation she was in, but I did like how her character grew within the story. Jace was all right until toward the end. I liked the snarkier more arrogant version. Simon, the geek and Clary's BFF, and Magnus Bane, a flamboyant warlock, were by far my favorite characters. I would've liked to see more of the villain of the story, Valentine.<br /><br />Overall, I enjoyed reading City of Bones by Cassandra Clare and would pick up book two.<br /><br />***A side note: I purchased the Kindle version awhile back (July 2012), and the file had issues with it. Some pages were fine, but others had a weird script and were unreadable at first. I did change the font, and then those pages were readable, but they were not in the right order for the scene. I was able to read the entire book because I also had a paperback copy too. This issue did not change my starred review.***
B00475AYJQ|5.0|Loved it at least as much as the Name of the Wind.  Can't believe I will have to wait a year till the last one in the series comes out!
B00BCOQSSQ|4.0|Everville is aimed at the teenage market and as that it excels, although it could be said that many other age groups would enjoy it equally as well. It's a fantasy that takes place over time in the present world and that of Everville, a realm that is experiencing catastrophic unrest. The protagonist is Owen Sage, a young man in college who has been chosen as the answer to all its current problems.<br /><br />Owen, however, does need to be trained and this, I felt, could be carried out over forthcoming sequels. After all, we all make mistakes and no one likes a perfect hero! Some of the best heroes we know have flaws. The danger here is that this important period of time could be crammed all in this one novel which then reads as unrealistic.<br /><br />The novel reads well although the travelling to and from Everville could be separated better. A new scene should also mean a new chapter to facilitate the flow of the storyline and to give the reader a clean cut-off point. No one likes to stop reading a gripping story that doesn't quite have a defined break at the end of a chapter.<br /><br />Using frequent view points within one novel is quite a bold move as few can pull it off well. Even the most successful of authors use this tactic sparingly. I feel it should be used once in awhile when no other method will suffice. Too many viewpoints can confuse the younger reader, especially; it would be interesting to read the opinions of those much younger about this particular novel.<br /><br />Although I'm not a great reader of fantasy, Everville, could be classed as one of the most interesting of this genre. It has enough action to move the story along with plenty of scope to enable expansion, if required. It cetainly warrants a first look and possibly a second read.
B0095ZQ36G|4.0|A strange, chivalrous encounter between a Catholic German fighter pilot and a badly damaged, out of ammo B17 is explored here. The event on which the book is based does not dominate the narrative, rather a reader gets a tour of the B17 crew's background, training, and deployment, plus the single background and story from the German side. The insight from the German point of view continues right up until the war's end in May 1945. There is also a review of how the &#34;top secret&#34; story that maybe all German's were not monsters became known.
B004KPLVV8|5.0|Great buy and timely shipping  Enjoying the original, thanks  The 80's had some great ideas for movies that we come back to today
B00COGY2P2|3.0|i thought it was entertaining, but I felt it needed more plot and background.  I would watch it but probably not buy it.
0143124544|4.0|Rating : 4.2/5<br />Source : Publisher ARC<br /><br />Louisa Clark lives in a small English village and works at a local caf&eacute;. When she loses her job she must find another since her family depends on her income. After much searching she finds a job - a rather well-paying one as the care-giver of a quadriplegic. The wealthy man in the wheelchair is Will Traynor, once a successful man leading an energetic dynamic life (\\"I led a big life\\"), but now frustrated at his helpless life. Will is cold and almost callous towards Louisa and she in turn is nervous in front of him and his steely-faced mother Magistrate Camilla Traynor. As they get on better terms, Lou realizes that Will puts up a brave front to hide his anger and despair, but she has no idea how fed up he actually is of his life . . .<br /><br />Moyes brings these two contrasting characters together and organically develops their relationship from cold hauteur to friendship and more. Louisa sees herself as \\"an ordinary girl living an ordinary life\\". Will, once he has gotten to know her better thinks her \\"bright\\" and \\"interesting\\", too bright to be stuck in \\"this bloody parody of a place mat\\". He is constantly egging her on to do more, to get out of her shell, to challenge herself and do something worthwhile with her life. Initially Louisa cares for the anger-filled young man in the wheelchair out of a sense of duty, but later begins to genuinely care for him. He on the other hand, patiently bears through her well-intentioned attempts to cheer him up, and by and by finds himself attracted to and comforted by her. Each assuages the other's fears, but it may not be enough.<br /><br />This book and its characters brim with emotion. There is hope and despair and regret, love and affection and anger. Moyes draws her characters sympathetically and with a kind eye. Her book delineates in great detail what life means to a person trapped in a wheelchair, dependent on others for the basic necessities of life - to be fed, washed and bathed, put to bed, turned on a side. It also questions the meaning of hope, and the assumptions we make to keep it alive.<br /><br />This smart, witty romance has great unforgettable moments. A lovely read, I highly recommend \\"Me Before You\\".shed and bathed, put to bed, turned on a side.

1250029465|5.0|Just finished reading the book. It was simply wonderful! It made me laugh and cry. Bob is such an amazing cat and I'm so glad he and James found one another. This is a must-read for cat lovers! Bowen gives such a heartfelt account of his relationship with Bob and an honest account of his struggles. I felt as if I was on the streets of London with them, worrying about the dangers and hassles of city life and relieved once they were home safe and warm in their flat. After reading the book, I want to meet James and Bob in the worst way! Bob sounds simply irresistible! This is the only review I've ever written on Amazon and I've read a lot of books. I simply don't want people to miss out on this awesome story, and I want people to buy the book to further help James and Bob. It would be a dream if they could retire from the streets. I think a movie needs to be made!
0307592839|5.0|I hated the title and the cover and didn't expect to like this book from the brief eyeballing I did of a review, but I absolutely fell in love with it and couldn't put it down.  The author is extremely talented, a great story-teller, and clever and creative, too.  As a old baby-boomer, I was heartened to see a member of a younger generation with good (humane) values.  I also liked that her point of view was subtle and not heavy handed.
B00B4804KS|5.0|The 3d version brings the action to life.  We really enjoyed the enhance color and audio which this video providedis
B009MYARIK|3.0|Compared to the other books from this author, I was disappointed with this last novel. It wasn't the kind of book that you can't put down, I found myself skipping pages and eager to finish it so I can skip to something else.
B00A285OOW|5.0|I love this series and this was another fabulous addition. If I have one complaint, it was that I wish it was longer!!
B007D2XSW0|5.0|nice to use havent really tried anything else but taking a picture iam sure im missing some thing else on it.
B004CRR9G0|5.0|This current version of Nausicaa is by far the best!<br /><br />The 1980's VHS version, titled Warriors of the Wind, all but killed any future anime releases in the US.<br /><br />The 1990's version was a lot better, with this version being the best.<br /><br />So if you are an anime fan from the 1980's and 1990's, you deserve to see this film as it should be seen: uncut and in Japanese.  Enjoy!
B004DLPXAO|5.0|have so many books to read now i dont have to buy the kindle just use this on my iphone but they still want more words im sure hahahah
B009XIXVU6|5.0|It was a bit difficult to get started but it is an amazing book.  Does he collect stories from different sources or create them himself?  The way he ties it all together is remarkable.  His portrayals of elderly as well as young show insights that must have been gained from experiences  He raises awareness of many problems which are difficult to resolve.  I will recommend it to all serious readers.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|What an amazingly beautiful and emotional story. This was one of those rare stories that is so well written it sucks you in. I was up late reading it and brought my Kindle to work to finish the last chapters during breaks. I loved the characters and the writing. I loved the mystery and all of the twists and how everything ties together in the end. I'm so impressed, I'm off to purchase another book from this author to get my reading fix this weekend!
B008OOYALE|5.0|ok I love the game and im twice as far in levels as my boyfriend, and yet he gets access to dragons and a trading portal among other neat buildings and I don't?! that hardly seems fair that apple devices get more options than kindle or aneroid devices.....
0783233477|5.0|I really love this movie.  One of my favorites.  The movie is long and slow-moving so some will not like it.  The last half hour of the movie is brilliantly done.  Anthony Hopkins is fantastic.
B0009P5YXO|4.0|My 4 yr old son and 2 yr old daughter take turns playing with this...and by take turns I mean with me =D. LOVE that it has the hidden message pen. I used that part on a glow in the dark zumba fitness event once and it worked pretty well!
B002ZG997C|4.0|This is a fun, bad-to-the bone Denzel Washington movie with a different twist.  The casting is excellent.  The story line is interesting and a bit different.
B008Y76VW2|3.0|With a talented cast, this should have been a more engaging movie than it was. The case was wasted on predictable story that relied on blue language to show excitement or anger. Jesse Eisenberg shines in this movie but he and the rest of the cast could have been so much better if they'd had a better script with which to work.
B00CWVFPGO|3.0|This movie has some terrible acting (not by the Governator, of course), and is generally quite cheesy. However, it's fun to laugh at for that reason. Watch this if you want a low budget wanna-be Hollywood action flick.
B000ID37SQ|5.0|If you have not seen this move you are missing out on a classic. You will not be disappointed. Buy it
0425263908|5.0|Think &#34;50 Shades&#34; but better. As you read, you will find many similarities to 50 Shades, but I'd recommend this book first.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|You have to be rational and a good puzzle solver to get out of the rooms and advance to the next floor. Try it it's fairly easy at first, but it gets much harder rather early on...if you like thinking puzzle games this is for you.
B007PT3QOQ|1.0|I loved this app a lot until this last up date. Now it tells me to GO to the app store and I can't up date it or play it. Someone needs to fix this immediately.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|It's a free game to play, with the option to buy extra stuff( as usual ) but you do not need to pay to enjoy this game and get items or costume that you want without cash if you want to just simply by being addicted to this game as I am. Oh and don't cheat on your age as the difficulty setting are based on this. You're just cheating yourself from a great fun experience!.
B0047Y17P2|5.0|A great story that keeps you thinking you have it figured out only to turn another corner. Can't wait to read the next one!
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Very poignant, but easy to read, not sappy or unbelievable. Kept my interest throughout.  I recommend this book. Loved it.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I am not a big reader but I enjoyed this book quite a bit and would recommend it.  Beautifully written
B005HJ6MRO|4.0|The app is easy to navigate and set up. Works for accessing my movies and files on my My Book Live.
0071766588|5.0|this book has helped me a lot. also, it was worth to buy it and the CD is really good for practicing the test
B003VANOFY|4.0|It sometimes flickers on/off for no discernible reason, but it's not very often. Certainly less now than was a week or so ago. Other than that, however, it works great. No real complaints otherwise.
B0054SMID0|4.0|Always liked McConaughey when he plays a wise ass, street hustling lawyer. The twists in the plot was exciting and well done. Kept me interested.
B005GIS1WA|4.0|My  2.5 yr old really likes this movie.  He still talks about it & he watched it almost a week ago.
B00C2VIA52|5.0|Wasn't sure what to expect since I have never played a card game like this but I truly love this game. It's one of the best games I have ever played on the kindle or any system honestly still learning a thing all the ins and outs but the more I learn the funner the game becomes. I would recommend this to anyone if your on the fence about this game g r t it. You won't be sorry.
B001F12J0C|5.0|i CAN WATCH THESE MOVIES AGAIN TOMORROW, OR NOT FOR ANOTHER MONTH; THEY STILL PACK IN ACTION AND INTRIGUE AND BRING ENJOYMENT.
B00BEIYH6U|5.0|Kick-Ass 2 was a strong, hilarious, and original sequel! It is, in my opinion, just as good as the first...They kept the feeling of the first movie while adding new twists and turns. I could not stop laughing throughout the duration of the film!
B005MLOKXA|5.0|This series is probably the best program available on TV. The stories are well-developed, the writing is excellent, all the actors are amazing and create the kind of characters that make you care about them. This series deserves more than 5 stars!
B00DUGCLY4|4.0|These puzzles in the beginning are way too easy. i've NEVER encountered a hard one. i'll keep playing though. there is an apple product game like this one if you have an apple product and want a harder version of this game.
0739366408|4.0|great book loved the audio version, bad ass characters, loved how they had a full cast to read the story
B00785P2QC|4.0|This game is lots of fun to play because you get to manage how the city runs and plus-it's FREE!
B009KKLQKO|4.0|So nice to see the Boys back together. Even though they didn't release the full concert, better some of it than none at all.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Once I started playing this game, I couldn't stop. With all of flows levels it is non-stop fun! You will really love this game!
B000FA5QEK|5.0|We are so caught up in our 9-5 thinking.  This book will help you think differently and see how you work and what you learn in a whole new light.
B00AO2P3GA|3.0|It won't let me download the game with my coins. Please help I really want to play this game while it's only 0.99$ to download
B0029LCJJS|4.0|My husband and I have been watching this series nightly for 2 weeks.  It's wonderful, but a little too much visual emphasis on Henry's sexual endeavors.
B00ANA27IU|5.0|I love Arthur's immense perspective of sci-fi, or is it sci-fi?<br /><br />Vastly better and certainly more complete than the movie, but I enjoy both. If one divided this book into 3 sequential parts, the movie represents (mostly) the second although the discovery in the first part takes on more meaning as the book and movie evolves.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is so fun! The graphics are amazing, and the minions are adorable! And it's a great game for everyone!
B006AN78XS|1.0|Admittedly, the film has an interesting premise - a man vacationing in Paris with his reluctant fianc&eacute;e begins taking late night walks where he runs across a 1920's limousine that whisks him off to another era where he parties with the likes of Picasso, Hemingway and Stein.  The only problem is that the acting is uneven and some of the dialogue is simply stupid.  Worst of all, Owen Wilson's nasal whining makes the film almost unbearable.<br /><br />There are some nice scenes of Paris though, so you could try watching it with the sound off.
140006922X|5.0|Interesting and fast read.  Extensive notes for anyone interested in pursuing the topic further. Comprehensive reporting of the historical Jesus research and theories.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Can't put it down. Very addictive. Totally love it. It is Temple Run only with minions. And more fun. You want this app.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|This game is AWESOME I want to play all the time so glad that they made this game off of the movie and everybody plays this game such a cool game
B0063IH60K|3.0|I have played numerous games in the 'Vegas' mode and have yet to win a game!!!  not much fun if you never win!
B005LAIII0|5.0|this movie had me crying and wishing for more. heart felt and amazing, never in my years have i seen such an amazing movie. watch it, i dare you  :)
B006MW3V6U|5.0|The characters, story, set and the entire production are outstanding.  These coupled with the actors abilities to bring each character to life make this a great mini series!
0156027321|4.0|dont get me wrong i love this story, but i hate the format and the way the book was written. just watch the movie :)
B004LWZW7Y|5.0|You do not have to be a kid to love this movie, but you probably will get the humor much more if you love cats. I saw each and every one of my cat's personalities in this movie. Maybe it is just me (but i think not) but I never belly laughed so hard. It made me think of my cat's over and over again, and I love how Puss saunters up to the bar and........oh, gee I don't want to give too much away. Just give it a whirl, I think you might like it.
B009UNH0EM|1.0|the cord is so short it makes hard to charge the blue tooth without having the blue hang upside down
B0014DQSGW|5.0|This is one of the best movies, in my book anyways! I love comedy, romance movies, and I love Sandra Bullock!
B00D6QU6RW|5.0|... Should be ranked among the greatest albums ever. Please read.<br /><br />I have always considered the Backstreet Boys to be more than what the public labels had given to them. The \\"Greatest Boy Band Ever\\" does not accurately describe, to the world, the significance and contribution they have given to the world of music. Their great hits, throughout the years, have always seemed slightly different than the other Boy Band's songs.  No one had songs like \\"Quit Playing Games with My Heart\\", \\"I Want it That Way\\" or \\"Shape of My Heart\\" And although that label \\"Boy Band\\" has several greats, (98 degrees, Boys II Men) I don't think they should be ranked only to them. The label has become a reason average people won't even consider them after they have grown up. BSB has always been more than a boy band. Sure they were one, and dominated the category, much like the Bee Gees dominated the Disco era. Music lovers know how they were great long before and after that era. When I heard BSB joined together with NKOTB on a recent tour, I cringed, it didn't seem right to me at the time.<br /><br />I have always loved good music. The kind that makes you stop what you're doing and escape. Sometimes it's the lyrics - so cleaver that you have to be listening with intent or you may miss it like most causal listeners do. (john mayer, ememim). Sometimes its the intensity - those songs that make you get up off the couch , or cause you to shake the car and turn heads at the stop light. (AC/DCs Thunderstruck, Katy Perry's Teenage Dream) I could go on...but for me, its the overall sound: the beat, the tune, the vocal harmonies, and the purposely subconscious subtleties. The greatest producers can make this happen for an otherwise average group or song.(Quincy Jones, Dr. Dre) There are only a handful of artist that can get greatness with nearly any producer, although the greats are always willing to contribute. (Michael Jackson, The Beatles) Sometimes the lyrics aren't even heard or understood. Lovers of great music can just tell the first time they hear it, \\"this song is special\\".<br /><br />So what started out as a mission to get them on American radio again a few albums ago (they never stopped making music, yet American radio stopped playing any of their new songs), became an obsession the day I listened to the entire \\"In a World Like This\\" album. This album was special from front to back.  Every song had something about it that made it stand out. The initial reviews were mixed, mostly on the \\"respectful yet average\\" to \\"stop before you regret it\\" feel.  One was so obvious that the guy didn't actually listen to it, stating how they couldn't be the boy band they once were...\\"  It prompted me to respond, something I had never even considered before, and yelled at him for not listening, because if he did, he would have realized his words didn't; couldn't have reflected the Album. That particular review ended up being removed. Not sure if there was a connection or not, but they must have realized their credibility could have been compromised.  Not only was the album better than average, It was clearly the BSB's best overall album ever.<br /><br />  And I will go farther and say it should be ranked among the greatest albums ever. Now before you think, \\"well you had me until then\\", let me finish. This is the first album, in twenty years, the BSB had creative control on what was put on the play list. They have  contributed to the writing of 8 out of 12 songs . And every song is tittering on greatness, if not already there. Front to back, everyone of the songs could be played on the radio.<br /><br />Now, it is in the \\"intelligence\\" of the album, that makes it great. Like \\"Thiller\\", songs were included to allow strong fans to love it right away. \\"In a World Like This\\" and \\"Permanent Stain\\" are like \\"Want to be Starting Something\\", a clear connection to past favorites. But then came the song \\"Breathe\\".  The first ten seconds starts off slow, and probably turned off some fans the first time. I'm sure this is where some critics turned on to \\"Sample Mode\\" and listened for ten to twenty seconds of each of the other songs.  But being placed right after two satisfying songs, no real fan was going to turn it off this early. Eventually, by the time we finish the first playing of the chorus, and to the fans relief, the song grabbed them, and brought the album up a notch. The Boys had planned some outings to introduce some of the new songs a few weeks before the album's release, and Madeline was played for them. It was an unusal sound, and even for me, was a worry. It could have been a song one of them wrote(which it was) and was included because of their first opportunity of having freedom to do so(which it was), but could have been a bad choice (Which it wasn't). To the music lover, it was a special addition the the BSB's song list. Completely different from anything they have done before. This is their money song. The \\"Yesterday\\" they have missed from previous albums, and proof that the critic didn't listen to the album. The song is about bullying, and clearly (for some anyway) this was a much more mature album than ever before. At this point I knew it was innaproprient to continue comparing the BSB to 1D. Not even in the same area code.<br /><br />I was hooked. And little did I know, the best was yet to come. I could finish my argument song by song, but any music lover would have to agree that this album is special.\\"Show em What Your Made of\\" and \\"Make Believe\\" could be their \\"Billy Jean\\" and \\"Beat it\\" If any fan out there was disappointed by a song the first time they heard it, I'm sure that by the third time they heard it, they were retracting their opinion, and looping the song(s). I compare this effect to Metallica's Black Album. Real fans were pissed at first, waiting for more of \\"For Justice for All\\" or \\"Master of Puppets\\". But eventually realized the greatness of the album. \\"In a World Like This\\" is there Black Album. If given proper attention, and great videos, it could produce \\"Thriller\\" like number of hits. And has unusual gems that could have \\"Yesterday\\" effects. And the Boys aren't done. In fact it could be just the beginning. Remember, MJs \\"Bad\\" album produced more number ones than its predecessor.<br /><br />Now, just go get the album now, you're going to get it eventually...
0553801473|5.0|I bought this for my nephew who was reading the series, he said they are really good. He got it really fast!

B000YAA68C|5.0|This movie is Really Good! If you like romantic comedy's this is the movie for you!  A little sad, but mostly not!
B005K17RU0|4.0|works great all the info you need in front of you.  seems to be pretty accurate here in Colorado where we have lots of weather changes all in one day.
0573016399|5.0|This is the real deal.  I used this script to learn the part of Valmont so that I could approach and audition with the lines already learned.  Got the part, used the script and saved my local theatre company from having to buy one.
B008OE05IG|3.0|Perhaps I will return and watch the rest of this movie but it just did not captivate me at all. I am surprised it got so much hype!
6304696515|5.0|Glenn Close, John Malkovich and Michelle Pfeiffer are the perfect casting choices, each really gets the complexity of the characters and plays each role to perfection.  Plus, the sets and costumes make this lavish production completely like going back to 18th century France.
B0042TV4IW|3.0|Not exciting, but a cute little show, purely family and kids type entertainment.... it belongs in the free to watch category.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This app provides Multiple Translations with Multiple Plans and is set up so that if you miss days it will<br />reset the days for you and adjust the timeline. No more excuses.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|For what it's supposed to do, it does it well. I use it to stream YouTube videos I'm watching. My problem is I mainly use Apple stuff, so switching to Chrome is another step. Another &#34;another step&#34; - switching to HDMI 3 on the TV. It'd be nice if it was all automatic, but that's not the situation yet.<br /><br />Again, for what it's supposed to do, it does it well. That's probably all that really matters.
B005544V6A|5.0|Keeps testing the mind! Great video quality as well as no video buffer headaches! Enjoyed every episode thus far. Suits!!!
0345525558|4.0|This novel was about an orphan girl that came to live with a lady that had a flower shop. Enjoyed it.
B00B2V66VS|2.0|Kind of stupid.  Have a new Kindle Fire HD and decided to put this on it thinking that it might be fun at times, and really show what some of the things that the kindle was capable of, but in actuality, it is really stupid.  Might be fine for a 5 year old though....
B009LGO88E|5.0|You can´t really expect the circle pad pro for the 3ds xl to be small. And it isn´t. It´s big. How big? Big enough to make it uncomfortable to put in my bag, impossible to slip in my pocket. But you know that going in.<br /><br />However, for its big size, it gets the job done, and it does it comfortably.<br /><br />Comparing it to the regular 3ds, the 3ds xl is alot bigger, and for my hands, a lot more comfortable to hold. Add a circle pad pro to that equation and it becomes all the easier to hold. Dont know about it being comfortable for kids though. I bought the version that had japanese print on the box, and was a little worried that it wouldnt work with my american bought 3ds. However it worked perfectly.<br /><br />Ive had the circle pad pro for about two months now, and havent gone tru the first battery yet (it only uses one), but i havent done any intensive gaming on it, so far around maybe 20 hours. Ive been using it for kingdom hearts 3d, and it really makes the game camera alot easier to control. I also own Resident Evil Revelations, but havent really given it much of a go with the circle pad pro yet.<br /><br />The only downside is that, on account of its design, it completely blocks off access to your stylus. So i end up doing a lot of finger mashing on the touch screen, but so far it hasnt been inconvenient at all. You cant shut off wireless either, not without removing the 3ds first.<br /><br />I think the circle pad pro communicates with the 3ds thru infrared, so no cables are necessary. It adds an extra circle pad (duh), and what came as a surprise -two new buttons. Overall it has 3 buttons, an R button because it blocks off the 3ds´s R button; but it also has two triggers ZL and ZR<br /><br />With these additions, i have no complaints about the circle pad pro, just a &#34;shame on you&#34; to nintendo for not designing the 3ds xl with all these things already built in.
B008OOYALE|1.0|While the game started out fun when I first got it I soon noticed that some of my neighbors were getting updates that I wasn't  and still am not privy to. These include dragons, New features such as trading between neighbors, crafting dragons out of items, battling dragons, and quests. The reason some of my neighbors could have these updates was because they play on an ios device such an ipad ipod or iphone. Also I have found that ios users now also have a whole new island as well.  Now having searched the developers website hoping to find a reason behind the huge differences between the games it was noticed that while quite a few android and kindle users were asking for answers and for something to be done about the MAJOR parity issues all they were getting were platitudes about how they ,storm8 were working on it and no real answers. Now it seems to me at least SOME progress should have been made and android and kindle users should have seen one or two of the new updates after all, ios users have had these features for a YEAR, a whole YEAR. I would also like to know why Amazon has seen fit NOT to pressure storm8 to fix these issues.after all Amazon you are well known for your strict guidelines concerning apps you offer on your website how is it this issue slipped through the cracks? Are you even aware your customers are only getting half the app? Actually with the ever widening gap between ios and the android and kindle not even half.
0375842209|5.0|We've read the stories of the holocaust before, the terrors brought to Germany and the rest of Europe by Hitler, the horrific plight of the Jews during World War II.  This is not a new story.  Think a reverse Anne Frank without the naivete.  But you've never read it like this.<br /><br />Markus Zusak uses the point of view of Death to tell the heartbreaking story of Liesel Meminger, a nine-year-old soon-to-be orphan at the beginning of the book.  Death is intrigued by Liesel and follows her throughout her daily tasks for the five years during the war.<br /><br />Because of a promise made during another war, Liesel's foster parents take in a young Jewish man, hiding him in their basement.  The young man and Liesel become friends by sharing words.<br /><br />This is a story of words: how they are used for creation and destruction, stolen and given, how they bring life to some and death to others.  Markus Zusak cradles and loves every word he writes, just as Death cradles the souls he collects.  The Book Thief brought me to tears more than once, not just because of my empathy and support of Liesel and her loved ones, but because of the sheer beauty of those words.  There were several times that I had to stop reading, go back and reread a sentence slowly just to let it dance in color and brilliance between my eyes for a minute.<br />The description of Death was chilling - not terrifying, mind you, but chilling.  He was a likeable, realistic, empathetic, and surprisingly nurturing character who has a love / hate relationship with his job.<br /><br />I would highly recommend The Book Thief to anyone.  Its descriptions of this terrible war are realistic and historically accurate without being gory, the story is a wonderful page-turner, the characters were believable and lovable, and the writing is superb.  It is one of the best books I've ever read.
B005L38QHA|5.0|I an very happy with this mouse. It came in less time that I expected and in excellent condition. I would recommend this product and company to anyone looking for this item.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Great game, lots of rooms, daily tournament and bonus slot game to build up prizes. Cannot put this down even when I'm not winning.
B00B8PRDHE|5.0|Ringos 72 b- day. I was there.  Great place the historic Nashville Ryman and Ringo is so cool.<br />The ordinal keyboardist from Santana doing Evil Ways is classic.<br />Todd Rundgren does his his classic songs and is fun to watch.Great energy.<br />The guitarist Steve Lukather from ToTo is worth the DVD alone.<br />And the voice of the singer from Mister,Mister Richard Page is great.<br />Extra bonus....Joe Walsh showed up for Ringo's birthday and does an amazing Rocky Mtn Way.<br />Ringo always has the best.This is a must see.
B00ABKGG0C|5.0|As someone else said I like to be not having to read through page by page of the main characters conscience after killing each bad guy. There is violence, story a tad supernatural and some nice heads ups for the next book. The only thing to note is that the future and the past can get better mixed at the end of the book since it does not say &#34;5 years ago&#34; / &#34;present time&#34; in any way and at the same time loses the italic (which I am not overly excited when reading more than half a page)
B006AN78XS|5.0|The scenery of Paris alone is worth the price of this movie. Many of us engage in Golden Age thinking and romanticize times and eras that have passed despite our realization that every age has it's own sets of challenges and problems.
B003Y6EL5W|4.0|This movie could become a cult hit!!  It is a little corny, violent and gory!!  I really liked it!!  Gotta see it then go see Kick Ass 2 in theaters now!!!

B005LLSZNM|5.0|Next to Breaking Bad and Oz, this is my favorite show. Interestingly this show is set in a Hamlet paradigm. It is both well acted and written. The three main characters Jax, Gemma, and Clay are multidimensional and engaging. It is a very interesting twist of a contemporary version of Hamlet. Katey Sagal is really the star. She gets to showcase her true acting talents in this series. Also of note she sings many of the songs on the show's outstanding soundtrack. Check out both the show and the different season soundtracks. Both will have you riveted!
B005ZI2ZUK|5.0|The creative story is a great early mystery for young children. I see that the author provides ample visual clues to what's in the box. The crate from the 'National History Museum', the MANY hints by the guard, and even the hole dug by the dog Fred, in the shape of a (DINOSAUR) bone.  The guards hints are amazingly creative. Everything points to the answer, but the reader is not simply told what is in the box. I can recommend this one to spark discussion and curiosity, for children to learn about mysteries. My son loved it and we can recommend it.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|The author's ability to make me feel as if he's telling my story has always amazed me. I would walk a thousand miles to buy any of his books!
0525478817|5.0|I was mesmerized from beginning to end of this book.  John Green is an amazing writer who brought young characters to life.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|I love this game and its super addictive! The only downfall is that the kids love it too but once an age is put in, that's what difficulty the game is set to. They'd have a lot more fun if I could let them play at their skill level!
B00821OX98|5.0|After two episodes almost gave up. It got much better after that so keep at it. Great cast and great crew. Went through the episodes in a marathon, couldn't stop watching.
B0050CJNJ2|4.0|There isn't a bad song on this album.  My only complaint is I don't have time to listen to it enough!
B001F6TXME|5.0|It works just like it should. I have no complaints. Just wish my camera could use the wireless one! Alas...
B005LAIH2M|5.0|This is a pretty cool movie.  I watch it a lot.  Lot of action.  Whole new spin to the childhood fairy tale.
B000HBK3MM|5.0|Yep, I love this album and anything CBR sings.  I just love her voice, *kind of* like Norah Jones, just chill in out, good music.
B00CFA222M|5.0|another cool movie that puts a little different spin on the childhood fairy tale.  I really enjoy it.  Action, and fantasy rolled into one.
B000002UAO|5.0|Ok People: anything by The Beatles is awesome/transformational/original/addictive/.........  Highly recommend this and every Beatles album every written.  These guys transformed rock-and-roll.  Love this album!
B0074QGGK6|5.0|This was so enlightening. Who says old folks can't learn from young folks! I just sorry it wasn't longer. ;-)
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Great book, read right after it came out about a year ago I think it was.  Anyway, I really enjoyed the book, very insightful.  Nothing but respect for these guys and what they do everyday &#34;over there&#34; and all they do each day while they're home to get/stay ready.
B00B4Z5J92|5.0|This film documents the history of Sound City studio in California. The site played a major role in the recording of some of the most monumental albums in rock history. Grohl did an amazing job with this film -- check it out!!!!
B003O85W3A|5.0|Holy cow, Never thought I'd be writing a review about their music, but can't say I'm surprised.  What a talented family of musicians and these guys have taken it to the next level.  I can't say I would have ever purchased this style had I not been biased to buy this particular band's music; however, after listening to their albums several times, I find a depth/originality that simply does not exist in most albums that have come out over the last decade.  Awesome sound/lyrics/different instruments...  I highly recommend.
B0051UP5NQ|4.0|The features are useful for android application. I still need more time to get used to it.I will rate it again later when I have used it more.
B00008NG5V|5.0|Perfect Chill on the lake, water-ski, pontoon, soak some rays, and forget the world for a day music.  love it.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Great game for the kids, they always choose temple run when they sit down to play.  Adults love it too!
B006LSZECO|4.0|Intriguing story full of twists and hairpin turns which keeps you glued to  the pages right up to the bitter end.
B008VBYN80|4.0|Lots of fun! A good way to kill time. Kids love it too! Wish I didn't have to be on the internet to access.
B006T5C5PS|5.0|It you want to learn about how to treat cancer this book is a must. It is easy to read and understand. Even if you don't have cancer, you learn so much about eating to stay healthy. It is a great book for anyone who wants to clean up there diet.
B00AEFY3MC|5.0|random bits to keep that people fall asleep on? This is one. Get it, keep it, remember it. It's actually hilarious and the cast is perf.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I am enthralled with this show. I think the writing and the performancees are spot on. It is also, unpredictable...which I love.
B00005JN0T|5.0|Not everyone's favorite but this is mine. I love this movie and when I need this Will Smith flick, I get it. I love him and love the film and it's perpetual messages.
B0058VW36U|5.0|It is an easy and very fun addicting game! The first time I played it I could not stop! I hope that you enjoy it just as much as I did!
B003GDYN24|5.0|This album for ME was a moment I needed to feel and hear someone that could meet me where I needed to be met. Kelis ALWAYS gives a variety. This moment and piece? I needed and continue to LOVE this.
B00AEFY3MC|5.0|First of all, the actors in this movie are all excellent and that is why it is so fun to watch! Second, the story is brilliant!  It reminds me of &#34;Last Action Hero&#34; meaning, the premise is a &#34;what if these things truly happened&#34;.  There are great mini stories of the characters that are just hilarious.  Especially the one with &#34;Guy&#34;.  Totally worth the money!  If you are a Star Trek fan, you need to get this!
B00AQ71FLK|4.0|great moba for handheld! takes a bit to get used to but a lot of fun. it is a good filler when league and dota are not available.
B00CL68QVQ|5.0|Best movie I have seen in a while ! Good love story. Seemingly real issues. I get all the reasons this won an Oscar , unlike some of the other winners last year
0156027321|4.0|It was much like the movie but more detailed. This book is the best fiction I have read in a very long time. I reccomend it highly.
B0027MJU00|5.0|It kept me spellbound.  I was totally surprised with the ending.  Very interesting characters.  A very exciting read.  I have read all her books and loved them.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This game rocks... mostly on the toilet but it's a great time killer. It doesn't transfer your data to any new kindle so be prepared to start over.
B008VVT51U|5.0|A wonderful movie that shows all of us it's never too late!<br />Watched it twice!  The music was great, too.
B005LAII3A|5.0|lots of action, diff storyline than first, but shares similar ideas... great action... like the character build up and finale
B00CLL1UY6|5.0|What a fantastic read!!!<br /><br />I fell in love with Sebastian and how he overcame the hardships that he faced!!!<br />From losing his leg and confidence at 16 and all the hardships that follow including his pregnant soon-to-be wife running off, leaving him with his young daughter and the First World War that wreaks havoc for his family and nation.<br />Yet he still manages to stay strong to support his family and himself whilst still managing to smile.<br />An finally he finds love again and his own self-acceptance!!!<br />A truly inspiring read for anyone!!!!
B004A8ZWW4|5.0|even though sci-fi is light, the idea of robots as boxers is pretty good... my kid even liked it...  good ending...
B000O8OTNC|5.0|i love how compact this is and i finely have something to sharpen not only the strata edges but the serrated ones as well.
B0057G1WB8|4.0|Product works as described. Not the easiest program to use, but I would recommend. The program is a quick uninstaller.
B009ZZDNT6|2.0|I made multiple attempts to adjust settings in hopes that I was missing something and that it would work. Not once did it actually go off. Glad I had a back up plan. Deleted this App.
B009E3EYS8|5.0|I got 2 copies and gave one as a gift.  Still watch this amazing video of the best Rock Band ever.
B00A757EFW|1.0|I love Pacman so much that I decided to buy this game. I thought there would be a regular joystick. What kind of control is THAT? I recommend NOT getting the full version, even if it is Pacman.<br /><br />By the way, the five star and four star reviews are from Amazon employees. This game would be rated 2 if they didn't interject.
B00BRBIA6C|5.0|Totally loveeeeeed it!! Her voice is the same as 30 years ago!! All of the songs are wonderful. My favorite are: When you loved someone, Back on your radio, Perfume in the breeze. I would recommend to any ABBA fan to buy her cd.
014312336X|5.0|The murder of Pamela Werner and the subsequent investigation reads like a mystery novel, except that the reader knows the facts are real. As much as I have to do, I stayed up late last night to finish this book.<br /><br />Pamela Werner, daughter of an eccentric British sinologist living in Peking, is found dead near the Fox Tower in Peking. Her death takes place outaside the Foreign Legation so technically the Chinese police are responsible for solving the crime, but since a foreigner is involved a British police officer is also assigned to the case, with oversight from the Legation commissioner. French weaves a tale which takes the reader into 1937 Peking, at a time when the Chinese Nationalists and the Communists have an uneasy truce and the Japanese are poised to take the city and sweep across all of China. White Russians, Red sympathizers, Americans in the pay of the Japanese, foreigners with degenerate tastes, the opium trade... all of these are part of the story.<br /><br />French gives you just enough background to put the story in context but not so much that you are reading a textbook on 1930s China. Even though I had an idea of how this story would end I still wanted to read it through to the very end. An excellent read for something I wasn't originally going to look at!
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game is amazing but it really needs the new uptade every one has it except for the kindle but other then that amazing game
B006GWO5NE|5.0|Thank goodness this works awesome!  Fixed all my issues with charging my Kindle fire. It works perfect and I am extremely glad I received this purchase so quickly as well.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I wish they would add<br />Wolves<br />Jungles<br />Caves<br />More spawn eggs<br />Squids<br />Potion<br />More items for creative<br />Other than that it's a great app!<br />About the app<br />It's is a very fun app! I love doing multiplayer games with friends and family! Survival is my favorite way to play:)
1401309666|2.0|Bought it for a college course. There may be some decent material in the book, but I found it extremely boring and mostly useless. If it isn't required reading material for school, you're better off finding info on the net.
1419702238|5.0|i dont like the part when he get out of control<br />and i dont like when he do the snow man<br />i dont like you<br />and i like when they play snow fight that one was awsome i really like that.<br />and i like the one when they do the snow man that is awsome<br />and that it
1400049628|5.0|If you're into Zombie/Apocalypse preparation this is the book for you. I found the Zombie Survival Guide to be a very entertaining read and so did my family members who read the book after I left it laying around. Not only is it funny and thought provoking, I'm sure it could prove useful in the event of an actual zombie attack. This book propelled me into reading World War Z by the same author Max Brooks. Now that book is very entertaining and thought provoking! Definitely give this book and other Max Brooks books a try, if only to pass the time.
B00992CF6W|4.0|Awesome game love it creative is great so is survival does not crash works well but how do you update?
B00957T6X6|5.0|.all the books of this series have been a pleasure to read and I,m looking forward to the next book to be released.I'll just have to settle for watching the show version until then.
B008OOYALE|4.0|Dragon Story is a fun little game where you create your own dragon island, similar to Dragonvale. You begin the game by hatching out a cute little fire dragon and learn how to feed it, evolve it, and eventually breed other dragons. It's very easy to learn all this because an NPC walks you through each step. You will catch on very quickly.<br /><br />There is a pretty standard system of leveling up in Dragon Story- you complete quests and feed your dragons to earn stars, which go toward your overall level.<br /><br />Technologically speaking, the game has good sound and graphics, with smooth animation as well. No problems or glitches that I've seen so far.<br /><br />Now, on to to often the worst part of this sort of app: the commercial side. (Shudder.) Surprisingly, Dragon Story ranks well in my book, with almost no pressure to buy in-game items such as gold, food and coins. There are no pop-up ads at the beginning of the game (as there are in another game I've reviewed, Tiny Monsters) and not many quests that require you to spend money. You will only find yourself spending money on gold if you are impatient or just really need something done faster.<br /><br />The developers of this game have also added a social aspect to the app: you create an ID for yourself that is exclusive to the game (you don't have to login to Facebook or Twitter like some other games I've played) and visit other parks to play with other people's dragons. The ID is mandatory, though- some quests require that you visit other parks or play with a certain number of dragons.<br /><br />MY OVERALL REVIEW: Dragon Story is a great game in lots of different aspects, although there are a few drawbacks that lost this app a star. Sometimes you may find yourself clicking on the PURCHASE button for a few in-game items, but honestly, that's fine! I would definitely recommend this app. :)
B009XIXVU6|4.0|Not as good as The Kite Runner but I did enjoy it.  Hope he keeps wrighting and I will keep buying.
B004SJ3BCI|3.0|THERE IS ONLY ONE REASON I RATE A THREE S TAR BECAUSE OF REDS MIGHTY FEATHERS IT SUCKS REALLY BAD I TRY TO HIT THE PIG AND IT HITS SOMETHING ELSE  I'M ON THE LAST LEVEL I CAN'T BEAT IT CAUSE IT SUCKS FIX IT ROVIO
B00EI6E17A|5.0|Gaga hasn't always knocked it out of the park - when I first heard \\"Born This Way\\" I was a bit skeptical. \\"Judas\\" did rectify that though. Now we have our first taste of ARTPOP with \\"Applause\\", and I knew from the very first listen that it was a fantastic track. There's such an exhuberance, and yet her songs are unique, interesting, and she has an immense amount of talent. And her voice is unbeatable, the pipes on this woman! I think it's possible I've listened to this song more than any other single she's ever released. A stuttering synth builds into one of the most epic choruses ever, which rises even higher when we hear the applause and cheers of the crowd. Thematically it's closer to The Fame, this carefree glee about the life of the rich and famous, but musically she's always exploring new things, and no new track sounds like the others. Yes, almost all of them are within a dance-pop genre, but Gaga bends, tweaks, shakes and explores that genre more than any contemporary artist - by making it into a ballad, a heavy metal tune, techno, Europop, piano, strings, trumpets, and there's always her fantastic voice there to tie it all together. ARTPOP could be The Big One. Monster fingers crossed.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Entertaining. The best  solitaire game. It is fast and easy on the eyes.It is well worth the money. I enjoy it every day.
B00DDZM0GQ|5.0|Really love this game! I must admit, I have a hard time putting it down. Great game for keeping your mind busy while waiting for whatever!
0062255657|5.0|This is a short novel that grabs you by the wrist and does not let go until it has led you to its conclusion.  Mr. Gaiman has once again shown why he is one of the most gifted writers that is writing today.  His imagination extends from Coast to Coast.  I have no other way to describe it.  There are no words that can accurately describe just how wide and varied his imagination truly is.<br /><br />This is a wonderful story about a young man that cannot find his place in his family.  He goes to the end of the lane and meets a grandmother, mother and daughter and develops a close bond.  This closeness almost ends tragically, but the power of love and commitment allows for a successful outcome.  I don't want to give more away, but this is truly a wonderful journey into fantasy.<br /><br />Read this book.  Just don't plan on ever forgetting it.
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|nice movie. me and my son love it. it is very good to see lots heroes at the same time.
B00AQ2G7D6|1.0|Didn't like it in 68 and somehow, magically the movie is worse now. Being a good husband I watched the movie with my wife and when she starts viewing a movie, no matter how bad it is she'll watch the film to the end. McQueen had some good roles but in my opinion he was just a so so actor and this movie proves that.
B00CW6DAKC|4.0|I'M MAD!!!!! I love this game its really  fun but a little bit ago the game's pictures dissapeard which gets me mad.<br />Also I didn't get the resent update. once and a while it says its out of sync so I reload and 30 secounds later it says the same thing and I have to keep reloading. when I go to visit my neighbors and I try to go back to my farm it pretends like the last farm I visited was mine! I would appreciate it if these glitches were fixed because I really do love this game.
B00BFUUMO8|1.0|I am not spending money for the stuff in this game. If it was fun, maybe. No way, no how.
B008YWY0HK|1.0|Very disappointed.  Just when my 6 year old autistic son was getting into it, the picture began to freeze and to pixelate.  We ordered a replacement, but the drama of a pixelating screen will wreak havoc on his willingness to try watching it again.  Let's hope we can get him to try, and the replacement works out.
B00DHSK3RM|1.0|I guess I just don't know how to play the game, seems easy and so I thought this was the game itself.  Since I downloaded it I am having trouble with my kindle and so am thinking about deleting it.
B00DHSK3RM|4.0|You can still get it on your kindle I did just use your computer<br />Go to YouTube and type in candy crush on kindle fire it gives you step to step guide for kindle users I got mine and plays great like on android and computer both hope this helps
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I just started this season and am loving it.  I'll come back and write more once I've finished the season.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|This is a really funny book and I recommend it to anybody who likes funny stuff. It isn't one of the best Diary of a Wimpy Kid books, though.
B00003CXN4|3.0|It is a serious look at drugs in America. How they get here and who uses drugs. More honest than most films.
B008SO9M8Q|5.0|does explain so many things about history and facts much more interesting than a history book. i just love it.
0307743659|3.0|I have read almost all of King's novels but I feel as if this is not one of his best.
140006922X|5.0|To hear and read the reviews and commentaries on this book one would think that Reza Aslan has come up with a new and horrible heresy.  Perhaps the professionally ignorant (such as the Fox News fool whom Dr. Aslan so neatly put into her place) are indeed shocked (or pretend to be shocked) by some of the assertions in Zealot, but no one who has an interest in early Christian history and who has read much of the recent scholarship on the subject will be surprised by what this book contains. Instead they will be pleasantly surprised by Aslan's vivid and colorful writing style which makes the world of the first century come alive.<br /><br />Dr. Aslan makes it clear that he is writing history,not theology.  His concern is to analyze the differences between the historical Jesus of Nazareth, an unlettered but charismatic teacher who called on the Jews to repent and prepare for the coming of the Kingdom, with the image of Christ, the Son of God who died for our sins.  Anyone who has read anything on the subject knows that there are difficulties here, but faithful Christians focus on the truths behind them while skeptics seize on any apparent contradiction and refuse to move beyond it.  Similarly, Dr. Aslan does an excellent job detailing the differences between the faith originally voiced by some of Jesus's original apostles, aimed only at Jews and ignoring the rest of the world; with that developed by some of those same apostles, most notably Paul, which reached out to a wider world and made Christianity a universal religion.<br /><br />Zealot is a  highly scholarly book, replete with extensive Notes (which are well worth reading on their own), which is accessible to the non specialist. No one who is not already questioning his or her faith will find anything in this book which will make them do so. Nor will non believers discover anything that will make them question their assumptions.  What the fortunate reader will find is an entertaining and colorful history of a tumultuous region and era in world history and of the early years of the religion which developed there.ltuous region and era in world history and of the early years of the religion which developed there.
B002T9H2LA|3.0|I didn't like this as much as kill Bill or Jackie Brown. These were more entertaining than this film. But this is only my opinion.
0062278096|1.0|If you already have the hardback The Casebook by this same author, then you don't need the official companion.  They're exactly the same except for the cover - same photos, same &#34;comments&#34;, etc.  A waste of money.  However, if you don't have the hardback then go for the soft cover version.
B00B0X4PIO|5.0|A well told story, lots of characters in different times of places, but still easy to follow. Loved the way the characters are explained and you feel a connection to them.
B00A4B9A1U|5.0|An amazing review of post-world war two American politics.  A particularly interesting, if amazing disclosure for an Australian reader.  I can only assume (with all those quotations) that the &#34;facts&#34; are true.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|My husband showed me this app and I love it. The ratings impressed me and its free so worth a shot. It's like a cool puzzle where you use things around the room and hints to find keys to open the door to get out, only to end up in another room.the idea is sort of a nightmare but totally fun but imagine that in real life lol,?
B00AU15HPC|5.0|If you are a lifetime Moody Blues and Justin Hayward fan, then you will want to hear this album. While not up to prior masterpieces like Songwriter, Moving Mountains, and View from the Hill, at age 65 Justin still sings as beautifully as ever, and manages to still touch the heart as only he can with his spiritual and insightful lyrics and melodies. As always, Justin leads the listener to interpret his songs in a deeply personal way, allowing each of us to apply our own personal experiences and perspectives. Still thought provoking with beautiful orchestration, haunting melodies, and flawless vocals as only Justin can deliver them, I had to listen to it a number of times before some of these really started to catch on, but catch on they did. Don't judge it by the first listen. Your reward will come with familiarity and repetition from this old friend who always has something special to share with us.
B0046W5E0Y|5.0|It is a great children's movie and I will tell all my friends who have GRANDS that they should see it/
B007J4T2G8|2.0|I did not think it was very well written. The characters were too much of a caricature for my taste.
B0094K1WZE|5.0|this movie isone of many movies by Tom Cruise that is excellent. Ghost Protocol is completely action packed from beginning to end. I wiuld recommend this and all Mission Impossibles to everyone.
B000Q6ZG5C|5.0|Another good one by J. K. Rowling. If you're a Harry Potter Fan and have a Blue-ray player, you might as well see this one in its finest form.
B00000IQV7|5.0|I had owned this on VHS for years, but I lost it to my VCR. I am glad to finally own it again only this time on DVD. If you have enjoyed Robin Williams in this movie, You would also enjoy, \\"Awakenings\\", \\"Dead Poets Society\\", \\"Good Morning Vietnam\\", \\"Jack\\", \\"Good Will Hunting\\", \\"Flubber\\", \\"Aladdin\\", Anything with Robin Williams accept for \\"Mrs. Doubtfire\\". Peter Smith
B005LAII1C|5.0|Very funny. Bought the TED teddy bear with the R rated voice of Seth McFarlane. Great movie to watch after a few drinks or with friends.
B000P0J09W|5.0|I never actually got to see this movie until I watched it in school the day we got out for spring break. Two months later, I ran in to Blockbuster to rent the DVD, But saw it on sale for $19.99 thinking it was worth owning right away so I just decided to buy it since it was cheaper then the rental. \\"The Goonies\\" will always remain a classic in my opinion!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! It's \\"The Little Rascals\\" of treasure hunting!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Peter Smith
B007URVZJ6|5.0|Simple, easy to follow roadmap to publishing on line and making money at the same time.  What more could you ask for?
B00003CXD0|5.0|I never got to see \\"Tootsie\\" until my family and I rented it from the public library (On VHS) back in the year of 2003. We didn't have our first DVD player yet. Ever since we got our first DVD player, My dad kept on saying this was a movie he would like to have but had trouble locating the DVD to buy for him. I was walking around Best Buy one Saturday afternoon in May 2007, I saw the DVD for a fairly decent price (this was before I became a member of Amazon.com), and I bought it for my dad. Before I saw \\"Tootsie\\", I saw Robin Williams' movie \\"Mrs. Doubtfire\\", and I just did NOT care for that movie at all. I'd rather see Dustin Hoffman as a man playing a woman. Great movie for the whole family!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Peter Smith
B001NLKZUA|4.0|I am a sucker for good Youth Literature and right now this series is keeping me interested. This series is no &#34;Harry Potter&#34; or even &#34;The Hunger Games&#34; but is has that element of fantasy/dystopian unrest that keeps the reader satisfied.
B00E6Z0THE|4.0|This was a fun point and click without those annoying HO scenes.  There was some going back and forth, but there was a good map and easy layout, so not too bad.  It was so refreshing to play a game without evil spirits and dark scenes.  I liked the puzzles, but I wish there were more that I had to solve logically.  These were mostly &quot;find the paper with the answer&quot; types of solutions, so I gave it 4 stars.  I will give you one general hint - sometimes objects can be re-used in this game.
B009JBWOU0|5.0|I was very pleased with my order, it arrived sooner than I thought everything was there, everything worked just fine and I really like the fact that they gave me ultraviolet copies of all three movies that was great!
B00B769XB8|4.0|The idea behind this movie is better than the actual movie.  The opening has a great set up for our hero and heroine, but the remainder of the movie never quite fulfills the promise.  Nevertheless there is sufficient action and fun that I really enjoyed it anyway.  There are interesting physical fights as well as CG action sequences that look great.  The action is broken up with some humorous sequences that are fine, but makes the pacing of the movie a bit uneven.  Overall, though, a good ride.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|This book will keep you guessing until the end.  It was an eazy read but a great story that kept my attention until the end.  I couldn't put it down until  I finishes it!
B00CFA225Y|3.0|This movie looks wonderful in 3D and the CG giants are amazing.  I guess it's meant to be a fairy tale for adults with adult themes maybe trying to remind us that the original Grimm tales really were a bit grim.  However, it comes across as just too much casual brutality even though it's all CG which detracts from the wonder of the fairy tale it's supposed to be.  It just took itself too seriously.  There are a few lighter moments, but not enough to balance the remainder of the story
B009NTNHJU|4.0|As others have said, the music itself is good, some even great, but the \\"music videos\\" aren't there. I thought maybe I had misread the description but no... so be aware, there aren't any videos. I'm just glad I didn't buy the original of either CD and bought the deluxe versions of Re-Up and Pink Friday. Why she didn't do a separate CD for the extra songs is strange. She's not the only one though. Katy Perry and P!nk both came out with extra songs but chose to re-release their previous albums with the added songs instead of write a few more and come up with a new album.
B00BN3DPQ4|4.0|The story is pretty rote, like a modernized western where the sheriff has to save his town.  Of course you watch it to see what Arnold Schwarzenegger is going to do.  He's actually fun to watch in this, acknowledging he isn't the young action hero anymore, but still providing plenty of action anyway.  There are also some interesting side characters to break things up so the movie keeps your interest throughout.  Overall, it's plenty of entertainment.
B002PEP4U0|5.0|William Kamkwamba' story was inspiring. How is it that a person living in a place with no resources managed to find out of garbage what he needed to survive and succeed. Let that be a lesson to learn to us who live in countries where knowledge and a myriad of resources are available just with the reach of our hands.
B00BUADSMQ|5.0|Bruce Willis is always watchable in any movie he's in and this character is perfect for him.  It's fun to see him with his son and as with his wife and daughter, the relationship has problems.  But of course the movie is all about the over-the-top action and this movie certainly has lots of that.  There are great set pieces as well as a good car chase.  Plenty of quips are exchanged and fun is had by all.  This is an enjoyable movie.
B004EF65QA|5.0|Excellent production of Mrs. Gaskell's masterpiece.  Wonderful performance from every member of the cast, true to the book, and beautiful set.
0671027344|5.0|I feel like this book is good at any age. If you're younger, this will be what you're going through. If you're older, it will remind you of your time in high school and bring you back to those times. It helps you see life because it puts you in the eyes of Charlie. That is the perk of being a wallflower; seeing and understanding. It just helps remind you about life and we all need that.
