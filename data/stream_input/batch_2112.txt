0399160450|4.0|Sometimes, the technical information is a bit drawn out, causing more of a distraction than I care for, but, on the whole, I enjoy Clancy's works.  I enjoy the characters, and always look forward to the next novel.
B0063GORYU|5.0|really helps pass time and program is User friendly. never stalls and has a hint button if you tap bottom of screen.
B00AHSIQWE|4.0|Great movie but a little long for me. Got a little board half way through but than it picked up.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|By far the best book out there!! This is not one of Nicholas sparks typical love story. It has love and drama and everything between. Read this book for 4 straight hours. Impossible to out down. Must rea!
0316228532|4.0|I was hesitant to start reading The Casual Vacancy. Whatever I have heard about the book up to that moment was not encouraging. Then my son read it and summed it up in two worda \\"complicated and messed up\\". That got me interested. While the book is a total departure from her previous writing, it is truly a strong attempt to enter the world of real people and go beyond the obvious. Though set in a small village somewhere in England, the situations and personalities could be anywhere. The ulterior motives and the quick  and partial judgement people put on each other is a universal case. The story is so revealing in its analysis of human personalities that it leaves you with a sense of wanting to understand in your own life what drives you and everyone around you  and what is it that they are thinking beyond the obvious. You start to think about their fears and aspirations as well as the hidden feelings and actions. You also start to face your own self.<br /><br />A strong portrayal of human reality, a shock to those who prefer to think of the world and the people on it in simpler terms.<br /><br />A good read.
B00B5HQLMI|5.0|Daniel Craig might be my favorite bond. the 3 movies he has done have been amazing!<br />It has put my faith back in the bond movies. If you have not seen this yet do so right away!
B004J4WLB4|4.0|This thoughtful and emotional novel comments on raising and being raised.  We hope that the characters can find the strength to bond enough to overcome their fears and support each other.<br />There may be a couple of parts in the storyline that leave you questioning the believability of it all, the characters make up for it.
B00992CF6W|4.0|it's awesome but should have herobrine lava village's wolves and eggs. I think everyone should get this app awesome app
0765325950|5.0|Brandon Sanderson has done an exceptional job at what I would consider one of the most difficult task for an artist/author.<br />He has continued another author's work and does a marvelous job at concluding the dramatic saga that has spanned so many long years. There isn't another writer that I believe could have done a better job except for Jordan himself.
B007BFSYMS|5.0|Really good app with lots of soothing sounds. Even in lieu of the stupid rating popup I still give this app 5 stars.
B001O1O71C|3.0|Read for a school assignment. Not something that I would normally read, but it made the movie much more interesting
B006LSZECO|5.0|I haven't finished a book in a few yrs, I couldn't  put this one down! It always kept you partially guessing.
0060919760|5.0|Great book. Dyer's premier work. Purchased as a gift, YEZ is one of the few self-improvement books I recommend to friends. Delivery was on time, and the condition of the book was better than described by the seller. Buy it and enjoy!

B0054SMID0|5.0|Most films deviate so much from the original book that it's disappointing. I really liked the book so I was curious to see the movie. Was amazed how it followed the book....really loved it!
B008ASGP3U|5.0|I very much enjoyed this quiet, relentless and dogged &#34;adventure&#34; with John Rebus - an older man who has his principles but doesn't let them get in the way of his popular idea of doing the job. As a character study, it's enthralling and uplifting. As a story, it's satisfying and very well crafted; as is the norm for Mr. Rankin. My two favorite writers are Ian Rankin and James Lee Burke. They tell human stories with threads of morality and spirituality. I was sad when this latest Rankin effort came to its conclusion.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|This book is reminiscent of the older Stephen King novels. I enjoyed this story very much not so many twists and turns, but 11/22 has a very good story line.
B005PK56TA|4.0|At first I wasn't sure what I got myself into, but it sucks you in and you can't help but watch!  It's very creepy, but worth tuning in!  I watched almost all of season 1 in one day.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Truly enjoyed this as much as the first two books. Sad that I don't have another one to read! Best books I have read in a long time.
B004QX07G4|5.0|Ellen is so honest, and so real, and of course very funny!  Don't even hesitate if thinking about buying this book. My daughter and I both downloaded this book for our kindles and we were  happy we did. This book is a genuine look into Ellen's life. A must read.

Kind of wish this was a play on it's own type game without the need for internet to ge friends to help out in various scenerios.
B000NQRE9Q|5.0|I received this collection for Xmas but have taken my time in watching all 4 films.  I do have the first collection on Standard Def which was not a bad production at all.  The Blue Ray Complete Collection is definitely worth having for a number of reasons.  I generally do not provide plot summaries and opinions of acting, nor my opinions as to which is the best or worse.  Many here have already done that.<br />However, the first film 'Indiana Jones and the Raiders of the Lost Ark' is the iconic film of the series.  Many did not care for the second film 'Temple of Doom' though I enjoyed it.  'The Last Crusade'  I felt was much fun with the inclusion of Sean Connery as Indiana's dad and the final film 'Kingdom of the Crystal Skull', while panned by the press, was still an enjoyable popcorn movie.<br /><br />Rather than split each films audio and video reviews separately, I will just say that ALL 4 Films, had an excellent transfer to video with great color resolution and contrast for all of them.  In none, not even the first and oldest, was there any disturbing artificial grain, no artifacts or aliasing on any of the them.<br /><br />The audio for all 4 films was DTS HD MA 5.1 and all 4 films fully utilized the complete sound system for both the soundtrack as well as foley and panning effects.  With this lossless audio so well made use of, you will be happy to have invested in your home theater system.  I will say that sometimes the soundtrack overwhelms what should be the directionality of the foley effects but the equally iconic music score was always meant to be a huge part of each film just like the Jaws soundtrack would come on when the shark was getting close.<br /><br />The extras disc has a great many 'making of docs, the Women of Indiana Jones interviews, behind the scenes and many more which I have yet to watch.<br /><br />The only real negative regarding this collection is the packaging itself.  While neat and tidy in that it will save you some room on your shelf, similar to the Clint Eastwood 35 years, 35 films Collection, each separate disc is in its own smooth sleeve.  I don't believe that the sleeve will harm the disc itself but it is impossible to remove any of the discs without touching the play side of the disc leaving any finger oils smudged on the disc.  Some do not care about this but I do in that I take anal care of all my DVDs and CDs and do not like having to grab the edge of the BluRay with my thumb and forefinger.  Yes, I could put each disc in its own separate DVD box but that is not the point.  I would have much preferred the discs being held in place by the standard center hole holder that you see for most DVDS.<br /><br />All my movie reviews are of this nature and focus only on the quality of the transfer to BluRay so check them and see if they are of help as well.<br />Hopefully, this review has been of some help to you in determining your purchase, hope I am on the correct path with a review of the transfer quality as opposed to providing plot summaries.<br />Thanksshelf, similar to the Clint Eastwood 35 years, 35 films Collection, each separate disc is in its own smooth sleeve.

B006MW3V6U|5.0|I enjoy Downton Abbey.  Although the story line deals with Lords and Ladies, it also reflects their day to day life and the same problems that other people deal with.  I just love it.
B00B2V66VS|3.0|I downloaded this game and it is so fun but then after a couple of hours it got boring. Ok I can admit it is a fun game but it is challenging as well.
B001L5YW9I|3.0|The movie was hard to hear during talking scenes and extremely loud during action scenes. I couldn't get a happy medium. Also, most scenes were too dark.
B005CKPQNE|5.0|This is my favorite show of all time. It is smart, well written, and the acting is top notch. If you havent watched you better start.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love it it's awesome amazing great I love horses ........... I just started this game I like it &quot;_&quot;
B003LQ3YXU|5.0|I have heard about this show and I am not a big Sci Fi fan. This was a fun show to watch and entertaining. Love the Brit the shows.
B003ODIZL6|5.0|Well I think that the new Oxford American dictionary is amazing new definition and all of that it has the exact words would look  for when doing my home work.
B004EYSXT8|4.0|Definitely a worthwhile read. The book added another dimension to my current interest in memory, thinking and learning by introducing the function of myelin. The stories and examples put forward are often anecdotal however it's a convincing read nonetheless.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|I love it because its like temple run but kinds better also I like how it has kids in cause temple run just has adults
B001A4LYN2|5.0|Definitely a performance deserving the award it won from Mr. Day-Lewis, and the direction from Paul Thomas Anderson is pointed and chilling, pulling you yourself in deeper with this self-desctructive man.
1400067820|5.0|This book expands the scope of Taleb's two previous books on the financial markets to a great variety of topics concerning everyday life.  I would take issue with a few of his comments on pharmacology, but other than that caveat, the rest is supurb and flawless.  On the negative side, this work does not attempt to list potential investments that are \\"antifragile.\\"  Given the title, I had rather hoped for this.<br /><br />That said, the book gives one a great deal to ponder.  I regard Taleb as the most original thinker of our era.  The contrast between Taleb's (correct) view of the world and the propaganda on the managed mass media could not be more stark or important.  As Clif High often remarks,  \\"Universe rewards thinking.\\"  Just so.  And this book is a prime example of this concept.
B008LV8TSU|5.0|I read this book after watching the movie several times. The plot runs a little bit different, but it's a fun story.
B009NQKPUW|4.0|I should have purchased the movie instead of renting. Only got to watch it twice but figured out most of the clues.
B002MQYOFW|3.0|It is one of those books that you read really fast, you enjoy a lot, but besides the obvious critics to the tv media, it just does not leave you anything else.<br /><br />I would recommend it a travel companion, maybe.
B00ABKGG0C|5.0|It was a great book!!!  The characters were well written.  The worldbuilding well done.  I just wish the next book would come out already!
034580404X|5.0|Personally, I loved these books.  I'm a scifi/fantasy reader (Robin Hobb fan) who occasionally dips into the romance genre.  The writing style of E L James is certainly different from what I've read before in fantasy books, but that's actually what I love about these books.  I think the majority of the story reads somewhat like a stream-of-consciousness, taking the reader along through every thought. And it's funny!  The author has a great sense of humor, adding little lines of humorous thought that I KNOW most of us women think (and unfortunately, some women have the audacity to voice out loud) when we encounter some of the most unusual, funny, amazing things that life can throw at us.  I'd have to say, James is quite intuitive.<br /><br />Initially, I decided to purchase this trilogy just so that I can say I've read it.  So I know what all the hubbub is about.  As in The DaVinci Code and Twilight hubbub.  Well, okay, I haven't read Twilight, yet, but you get the point.  I approached it with an open mind, and found myself finishing the first book, Fifty Shades of Grey, in 24 hours.  Never counted on loving the story enough to sacrifice sleep.  In any case, get your hands on the book and dig in.  You just never know.  At the very least, you can use the Fifty Shades as an icebreaker at your next event.
B001UTW7QU|5.0|Loved it! The characters, the chemistry, the whackiness! Watched the next three seasons and hope to see the rest soon! JJ Abrams is a genius.
B004784ZKM|5.0|I've owned a copy of this since it came out. I have always enjoyed the sonic quality especially the fade out at the end of Suppers Ready. Miss Peter here but Phil proves he is a suitable replacement. This is before he became a circus sideshow.
B00AK0X5VQ|4.0|I love this game and have found it gets REALLY hard as you move through the levels. Be sure to get in close to make tiny movements to avoid collisions.
B002EMESSM|5.0|just love this movie..... thats all i can say.<br />there is nothing great about it its just star trek..lol<br />watch it ... and don t think to hard on it
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|This is one of the best games that I have played in a long time. I want more games like this one. Keep up the good work...
B007FEFLTO|4.0|My only disagreement is the author referring to African Americans during the 30s and 40s as Blacks.  My early years I recall hearing the race referred to as negros or coloreds.
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|Loved this book.  No real dead spots in it.  I enjoyed the cyber warfare aspect, and there was plenty of the standard espionage and military action included.
B00ARN0WBW|5.0|i bought this movie and it was as good as the ones before it..keeps you on your seat..my kids son 13 and daughter 9 all watched it to..we love scarey movies and it was just enough ..worth it
1616550414|5.0|If you love Zelda get this or you're a liar. With all the art and the explanation of the story line this book is great for any Zelda fan. And with a very deep look into Skyward Sword, and the manga story of the very first Link, the Goddess (Zelda), and the war that sent Skyloft into the sky. This book is the best thing ever. A must have.
B001AW156U|2.0|These triggers were great in the beginning and amazing with first person shooters, but they were hard to adjust to and not just that, but they actually snapped off in the middle of a game as I made sure that they were properly secured. When I went to put it back on, I saw that the triggers cracked and wouldn't go on. Very Cheap quality, not worth giving them your money.
B0055SWM08|5.0|If you love a great challenge... Quell is the game for you! Some levels are really challenging but those are the levels that keep you on your toes.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This app wasnt very fun on its own, but was great for time wasting at airports or while waiting in line
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I loved this game it showed intimition and I show recommendation with this five star review. When you play this game I would care about the horse just as much as a real one.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I find Downtown Abbey a nice change of pace from the normal Tv shows.  It's has a dry sense of humorous suspendful and clean atmosphere.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|This game was great fun and I especially like that I could choose a difficulty Level. Having the game play take place in two different worlds made the story much richer.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|My husband loves the game, I haven't quite gotten the hang of it but the granson who is 6 likes it too.
B000QRIGLC|5.0|Best book I have read in a long time.  I felt I was with him during the fighting.  Well worth every cent I paid! Awesome book!
B00AF6B22E|5.0|I loved it! Denzel really deserves on oscar for his performance.I can relate to his issues,because I was once an alcoholic myself,I hated the lying,so i've been alcohol free for almost four years now.  In the end he made the right choice.
B0053O89RY|4.0|Always hilarious! Another funny season! Just plain fun to watch and difficult to turn off. Love the premise of the show, that families are blended and crazy.
B000HX4ZF6|5.0|best epic battle of all time! It's not just about getting even for what they did to his wife, It's about fighting for what you believe in.  FREEDOM!!!
B009EEFTMC|5.0|This is a fun game that you will enjoy playing over and over.  I have only started with the easy one - will work my way up.
B00ARN0XGG|1.0|This movie SUCKS! You can predict every scary event that's going to happen.Then at the end it was more like a zombie movie.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|I think subway surfers is super. except for the fact that it buffers spmetimes.  Otherwise its awesome.  I was obsessed with this game ever since my friend reccomended it to me.
B002BU0DPE|5.0|works awesome for your computer or gaming console. Have not had any problems and really gives you the gaming edge.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|I absolutely loved this book. I couldn't put it down. I loved all the loving and heart breaking moments in the book.

B001HNE3NO|5.0|A brutally captivating story of a child trying to make sense of a world gone mad the devastating effect it had on  her life and the lives of others who cared.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Amazing story, different than any other Nicholas Sparks book I've ever read. Suspenseful at times but a great ending. Can't wait to see the movie!!!
B0006ZE7G2|5.0|The description said used with minor scuffs and scratches, but I searched every inch of it with a magnifying glass and couldn't find a single imperfection! Mine is either brand new, or whoever had it before kept it locked in a museum quality case, because it is absolutely pristine! I could not be more pleased! Thank you so much for misleading me! It really made my day!
B003IHUHYG|3.0|now, this movie is one that kindda starts slow but gets better in a short time in the movie. its got action. its got funny.
B003D0E3FM|5.0|It's a sci fi classic for a reason.  It has a rich story line, particularly for the time when Fordbidden Planet came out.  If the characters aren't fully three dimensional, they are interesting and principled.  You care about them.  The backdrop of the story is rich.  Set in the far future, the story assumes a huge, peacefull interstellar human civilization, with lots of interesting technology, used matter-of-factly by the crew as the story progresses. The special effects aren't even that bad for the time.  The whole thing is an elaborate morality-play, that if a little corny, pre-sages the inability of science and technology to overcome the limitations of human nature.<br /><br />The movie has held up well over the decades and is worth watching for any of the reasons above, or simply if you want to see Leslie Nielson back when he played dramatic roles (he was a very credible leading man in this one!)
1558908846|4.0|this is an assume movie. everyone should watch it and get it. the action the excitement the funny parts its all very cool.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Fun game. Kept my 5 year old niece and me amuzed. Easy enough for her and a challenge for both of us. Recommend!
B005LAIHPE|4.0|this movie is pretty much action all the way. the cuning the plans. it is simply awsome. see for yourself.
B00597A6NU|5.0|shows how the people of the now nearly gone greatest generation were.....when men were men.  I need 4 more words to finish this rating
B005HEQ4XQ|4.0|excellent series great characters I particulalrly like data. A Rodenbery masterpiece. I reccomend for evertybody on the planet earth todsy
B000SLP4SE|5.0|soooo very accurate...just how the present government plays games with its people......very likely scenario, where the totally innocent can be portrayed as criminals....typical  of left wing liberal government and its supporters.  great film
B005HED08I|5.0|The quailty is even better than the original broadcast. Brings back memories of one of the greatest TV series of all time.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This was a very good read.  I love this author and was excited to see more of her works available.  Hope to see even more in the future.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I loved it. It was so good that I am buying the movie in blue Ray<br />DVD love it .
B005C6HGSG|5.0|I'm a Supernatural fan and I loved this book. The show has been lacking this type of writing lately and this is what most of us love.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I read in the bath until the water was freezing, I read while I was cooking and that didn't end well.<br /><br />The thing is, this could happen, wouldn't astonish me at all. I got claustrophobic just reading about living in the silos, and tired walking up and down the endless stairs to the garden or maintenance levels. Wondering what was on the outside, and then as the series progressed wondering and worrying even more about what was upstairs in the leadership.<br /><br />Outstanding series, and it isn't as simple as it might seem - ever.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I love the graphics and it's sooo much better than the first one. It's not just a criss cross of 2D green marsh; it is 3D and you go up and down hills. The scenery is varied which makes it entertaining and you can collect gems in case you die and it's better than wings since you actually are dead when you use the gems and with the wings you waste them when you use them cause you don't know when you might die. Epic job, Imangi!
B001OKJU4M|4.0|I liked the movie because it moved along at a good pace. The acting was average or better. Michael Douglas was good for the part. The story was good  but the writing fell a little short for the sub characters in the movie.
B0064MT1LM|5.0|This was a gift for my husband. Once he watches a movie he likes he has to have it. He loves it.
B009SQRC9E|5.0|Great story, well done, love the priniciples that surfaced to bring real happiness to the characters.  Not disappointed purchsed movie.
B003O86FMW|3.0|The author seems to run out of ideas and have unexplained rescues. The three books should have been combined into one book
B0046B1KHG|5.0|Fun movie for kids.  And has a plot that parents and grandparents can enoy it also.  Grandson really likes it.
B001KDQ4KQ|5.0|Its a pleasant read such a good story that was full of shock and great emotion that the reader can feel
B0036BP6XQ|5.0|A great story and many excellent life principles reflected in the choices.  Something that all ages could enjoy.  Great, clean movie.
B00637D114|5.0|great funny family film<br />great comedy scenes<br />but tht one scene where Gargamel Makes A OLD WOMAN BECME YOUNG AGAIN AND GARGAMEL MAKES THE SAME WOMAN'S BREAST AND ASS GROW IS AWESOME
B005LLSZNM|4.0|always come kind of insanity that keeps me coming back to see what is going to happen next.<br /><br />last two words
0761536434|4.0|This is a great book, not visually impressive, but excelent contentwise. And huge too, really heavy<br /><br />Just not going to give 5, because the fragile paperback cover got some white in the borders.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|this game is so addicting. I haven't had any problems with it acting up or anything on my kindle. it is so much fun
B002BI6SMI|4.0|Bryan (played by Liam Neeson), retired, has very special skills honed while a top-notch field agent for the American CIA. Bryan is also a divorced, very divorced from his ex-wife's perspective, parent of a precocious teenage daughter with singing aspirations and a yen to head to Europe, Paris first stop, in order to follow the international rock group U-2 (?-for a 2008 teenager but we will let that pass). Those Bryan honed spy skills turned out to come in very handy, once he relented and let that wayward daughter head to Europe. See almost as soon as she (and her dippy friend, her older girlfriend) , as single good-looking teenagers on the loose, are spotted and violently kidnapped by a nefarious international gang of white-slavers who are looking to place young girls in their whorehouses or sell them off to the highest bidder.<br /><br />Thus, we have the perfect storm between a man with a ruthless set of spy skills and a previously neglected daughter in distress and Bryan must use every one of them before he is through. The bulk of the film revolves around Bryan chasing, hitting, shooting, beating, torturing, shooting (oh, I said that), interrogating, driving, leaping, mano y mano fighting, and just plain being a mal hombre as he works his way through the litany of bad guy involved in the white-slave trade from lowly thuggish Albanians (who seemingly collectively cannot fight off one guy) to middle- man pimp daddy French society figures to paid off French security agents to oil-soaked depraved sheiks who specialize in deflowering young girls before he saves his still chaste daughter (naturally) and sends her back to California and a grateful mother, and more respectful ex-wife.<br /><br />Recently in reviewing another protective parent drama, 2001s The Deep End,  I noted that I had been listening to a \\"high brow\\" talking- head discussion about the sea-change that has been occurring in the way American parenting has evolved over the past thirty years or so (the speakers however covered themselves with the caveat that this trend excluded certain ethnic, racial, cultural and class exceptions, in short, this was about how middle, now middle, and upper class parents raise their progeny the cohort of that and this film). The gist of the argument was that the new \\"coddle\\" generation (say those under thirty, okay) have never learned to fail, their parents have never allowed them to experience failure, and therefore they have never learned how to fly out of the nest unaided and therefore are ill-equipped to face the wicked old world and its snares. And that is a future problem, no question. However I would amend that statement here and say that old Bryan, with remarkably few scars, won the parent of the year award here, protective or not.
0385344228|5.0|Could not put down!  Not only twisting and turning plot but great exploration of family dynamics.  Makes you think what would you do?
B0040I09RM|3.0|Almost done watching the first season. Not sure if it interests me enough to watch the second season. Some of the characters are done well by the actors. I just don't know if I want to see the same acts of violence, sex and drug use for another season. Been there done that.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I was grounded when it came out but my older brother bought it. After that I have been addicted to it I got Scarlett Fox on the first day. Way better than the first!!!!
B003LQ3YXU|3.0|funny, wacky, weird. Only started watching it because my niece likes it. Me thinks it's got some sort of cult following. Actually, I'm probably not a very good judge of this series because I'm only on the first season. It's good for dead brain time.
B000002B35|5.0|I love Pink Floyd, and this is my favorite album!  They are SO amazing live!  I put it on in my car to chill during a stressful day, and I even crank it up to stop my one-yeard-old from crying!  I get so lost in the guitar solos.  If you want to get into Pink Floyd, START HERE!  It features all of my favorite songs from various albums.  An awesome collection of songs in this concert!
B004GHNIRK|5.0|Victor Hugo shall remain the man who not only embellished his work with an excessive amount of prestigious vocabulary but embellished it with truth and passion.
B009ZQC7MY|4.0|Love Downton Abby but the picture quality was not as good through Amazon. Also, the description listed led me to believe that I had not seen episode 5 when indeed I had. I will probably not use Amazon for TV shows, only for movies.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|I love this game. Graphics are great, story line us good. Just an all around great game. Yes, you must purchase to continue. So what? It's worth it.
0763644765|5.0|Excellent book for babes. We keep this one next to the toilet, and our little lady appreciates the subtle humor and I appreciate the simple drawings.  There is no, 'Big girl/boy' nonsense, which is also a plus.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|well i read the first one as well then i had to see how he got her back then how he ended up keeping her and as the book got further along he wanted more and he got rid of a lot of his equipment for her because she didnt like this or that and he wonted to keep her even though we all in the back of our mines wouldnt like to have a little bit of play time like this but we have to trust our partners if we do.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|It gives the viewer a sense of what life was like in the time in which it was written, before, during, after World War II. I can remember some of the things that happened during that time. Having been born in 1936, I was not very old when it began.<br />  I have a brother-in-law who was in the Invasion of Normandy, Omaha Beach. He's a decorated war hero. He will be 90 in August, is still very active,raising cattle with his sons help. He and my sister were married 65 years last July.<br />  I love the fashions that the women wear. The whole program makes you feel as if it is real. What fun it must be to have such a beautiful place to act. Highclere is a beautiful castle, and the way the owners have brought it into the present by using its resources to help them maintain it gives it all a sense of reality. .Its a beautiful place with lots of history and drama itself. Thanks to the owners for letting Downton be  filmed there..
0451228375|5.0|Another great novel by Ken Follett and it was just as good as the Pillars of the Earth. I could not put it down and really enjoyed the book and the story.
B00A3XWAU2|3.0|When this project started, everyone went on and on about how this is what Whitesnake should sound like and this is the album Whitesnake should have made and Whitesnake should have this and Whitesnake should have that. After listening to the whole thing, I can safely say that Snakecharmer is overrated. It's not bad music, but it doesn't even come close to the Whitesnake greatness of the '70s and early '80s. I was expecting some bad ass, hard rockin' bluesy songs with great bass and solos, but instead I got boring songs with barely any guitar.<br /><br />On a side note, people need to realize that Whitesnake isn't a shameful hair band anymore. Coverdale was smart enough to realize that he was doing wrong and left the music scene for a while and eventually returned with a 'new' Whitesnake without the cheese. Their two latest records, Good to be Bad and Forevermore are excellent, bluesy hard rock.
B004XVN1T4|5.0|Ken Follett, come on, give me a break. Of course this was an excellent book to purchase. It was my very first Kindle book and I really enjoyed it.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is very realistic for a game. My grandkids really love playing it and when they aren't here I get to take care of their horses
0525478817|5.0|Yes, a book for all ages, and everyone should read it! I found myself laughing and crying while finishing it in a day and a half. Could not put it down. The writing style is quirky and mature!
B008133MDK|5.0|This is the best incarnation of Sherlock Holmes and Dr. John Watson yet! If you love Sherlock Holmes, then you will love this television series. I own both seasons and I can't wait for Season 3!
B005OZE9SA|5.0|This was a gift to my teenager who loved it. I have no idea how to use it or how it works, but she has been using it now for over 6 months and loves it.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|The story telling from the point of Katniss was excellent. It was like I right there with her, feeling what she was feeling, thinking what was thinking. The evening I read the the chapters the included the night and the morning before the games I couldn't sleep afterwards. Her emotions became my emotions and I couldn't help wonder how I would handle that situation. Very rarely does a book get so deep inside me.
B007C8MK2Y|5.0|Yanni is one of my favorite artist. I went to one of his concerts this past summer & the music on this CD is what he played at the concert. I also have this in DVD so I get to re-live the concert over & over. Love my Yanni!
B007TNS6JI|5.0|Good graphics and action. Controls are a little hard to get used to and they really push you to buy upgrades.
B009HV2JT8|5.0|The only thing I did not like was the overwhelming power of the vampires and their ability to walk in the daylight.
030759565X|5.0|I bought this book after reading the blog and it's a great addition to what the blog has to offer.<br /><br />Recommended!<br />D.
B00992CF6W|5.0|You should really get it its worth the money and when you have it get pocket editor it's awesome! You can change creative from survival!!!!!!!!!
B001B6PBBK|4.0|Hadn't heard of this movie but definitely recommend it.  We always love Brittany Murphy and she is cute as ever in this fun story.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|This season continues from season 2 with the same awesome acting, mystery<br />and I love the series.  I just can't stop watching this, I wish more movie series were<br />like this.<br /><br />I would highly recommend this.
B001DHXT6G|5.0|Can't beat classic Star trek! I have boldly gone where I have never been before from A to Z as it was intended! I HAVE BEEN BEAMED UP!
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Very well written, the whole series is addicting to watch.  You just can't<br />get enough.  I love this show. I would recommend this series to everyone.
B005IURG36|5.0|I bought this as a gift for someone who admires my sister,  Natalie Wood.  It was her favorite book throught her entire life.  The person who received it,  was brought to tears
B006MW3UZW|5.0|There are so many characters one can surely find a favorite to either love or hate.  Very well acted. Both the servants and the<br />the aristocracy have complicated relationships within their circles, and some surprising relationships across the social divide.  All very believable and set in a very interesting period in time
B008B92U32|5.0|I got this for my son, and he thinks its a blast! He swaps not only faces, but other objects around.
0062200909|5.0|Very creative, imaginative and artistic book. Any Hobbit fan will love it!  Makes a great gift, sure to be a collector's item.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I have never been a big reader - it has to be good if it can hold my attention. I love this series. They are three of very few books I have read that I could not put down!
B003V5CFV8|4.0|A must see. a tour de force. Audiences world wide must see this film. Some other hacks review line. Fin
B003O86FMW|5.0|I have never been a big reader - it has to be good if it can hold my attention. I love this series. They are three of very few books I have read that I could not put down!
B008FPOIT6|2.0|I read this book very quickly but I was disappointed with the content. It was written as if for a high school boy.
0307719774|5.0|It's a great book for a little self-exploration! I am anxious to see what next year's answers are! This is the first journal I have had that I religiously write in every day!
B008FYZIVY|5.0|Had never heard of this series until seeing the story of Highclere Castle presented on CBS' Sunday Morning.  I headed straight to the computer, watched the first episode and was hooked.  Ordered Seasons One and Two and have enjoyed one of the best series I've seen since Lonesome Dove.<br /><br />My family LOVES visiting the Biltmore Estate in Asheville, North Carolina and the very first scenes of Downton Abbey remind me of how life must have been lived in the USA's largest home.  The early rising staff are busy as bees throwing open shutters to let in the morning light, lighting new fires in the fireplaces and straightening the large rooms from the use of the previous night.  Each person is weaving in and out among the others in a fast clipped pace to ready the rooms before the family members rise from their beds.  I have envisioned such scenes when visiting Biltmore and Downton Abbey brought them to life right before my eyes.<br /><br />The quality of my dvd set is excellent.  I've read some reviews from dissatisfied customers but my set is of excellent quality.  I'm already sharing it with extended family members and they are giving it an A+ rating, too!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I have never been a big reader - it has to be good if it can hold my attention. I love this series. They are three of very few books I have read that I could not put down!
B0094BB4TW|5.0|I love facebook I have been a facebook user for a long time love love love it  im able to stay in touch with family thats far away
B008XBCJ34|4.0|I do wish that more things (dragons, Ammo, insects) had been made to fly out of the screen, instead of staying &#34;below the glass&#34;. Not as fine a movie as Titanic, and the battles are nowhere near as good as Spielberg achieved in 'Saving Private Ryan'. But excellent in this format, I REALLY liked it.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Works great.  Used it for my taxes.  I give it 5 stars for doing what it is suppose to, which in this day and age is tough to get.
B005SJIP1E|5.0|Low cost, and very, very good interpretations. Recordings are older, mostly 1960's, and have sort of a &#34;British Rock-n-Roll&#34; emphasis on midrange. A lot of Mahler's unusual &#34;instruments&#34; (especially in the 7th) don't sound like they would in live performance, and their is an overall &#34;tightness&#34; --  the sounds lack &#34;air&#34;, and the wooden instruments (clarinet, oboe, bassoon, strings) sound too similar to metal instruments (flute, french horn).<br /><br />Because of this tonality problem, there are many individual recordings which are more satisfying from a sonic point of view. (E.g., for that 7th symphony, Yuri Levin/Atlanta.) But no Orchestra Director has a better set of tempos and interpretations of the symphonies on a BUDGET CD set. (MTT/San Francisco and Solti/Chicago are fantastic interpreters, with lots of great performances available - but not as complete BUDGET sets.)<br /><br />The EMI set, with many different conductors, contains some performances which I consider very unsatisfactory - actual interpretation *mistakes*, although it does contain all of the song cycles as well. It also has many legacy recordings with sound issues, My review is in comparison to live sound, from the concertmaster's chair: I have played several of these symphonies and song cycles.
B0079XPUOW|3.0|The story was innovative and exciting.  The plot was excellent.<br /><br />The writer seems to lack writing experience or skill.  Character development was marginal, the occasional joke was not funny, and the writer tried to use harsh language for dramatic effect instead of skillful writing.
B005HP2JAM|4.0|It starts out like a normal documentary ... but as it proceeds, it becomes more and more fixated on Herzog's OWN dreams. You'll wonder &#34;why is he so fixated on those horses&#34;, and you'll find yourself watching a scene about albino crocodiles and the evils of nuclear energy.<br /><br />Magically, this &#34;Documentary&#34; becomes even more myopic and introspective than even &#34;Heart of Glass&#34;, in which the actors were hypnotized at the start of each filming day. If you consider Herzog to be one of our most talented and unique film artists, as I do, then YOU MUST BUY THIS BLU-RAY. But if you didn't like 'Grizzly Man', then stay away - this film is even more extreme.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Love this game! Very challenging in the higher levels. Very relaxing.. I was pretty surprised. I saw this app on a client's child's kindle, it has proven to be adult challenging.
B001UTW7QU|5.0|I was hooked from the beginning.  Anna Torv carries the show brilliantly, and the rest of the cast is spot on.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|Just like any other Nicholas sparks book..... exciting and dramatic love story with an even more dramatic ending. I enjoyed reading this book until i started seeing previews for the movie. Movies never do the books justice and they change the way i see the characters. I would definitely recommend reading the book before seeing the movie
B0072V394E|2.0|Maybe when it was filmed was a hit, but now it's dated. The dialogues are ridiculous, it can be fun because it's so bad. It's dubbed in English, and very poorly. Whi not leaving the subtitles?
B00B2V66VS|1.0|this game sucks its not cooler as the first one the first one is way cooler than this crappy one
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I downloaded it for my sister and I played it for 5 hours straight.And I fell in love with beauty my horse.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|I can't stop playing this game! It's fun and addicting. Get this game I'm certain you'll have fun and will play it often
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|Collins begins the third and final book of the series with the same intensity and intrigue as the first two books, but lets it lag in parts. Overall, a good storyline, but a tad disappointing. I love the series so much though that I was able to overlook the shortcomings and still enjoy it.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I liked this book because Christian reminds me of my fiance. I would recommend it to everyone. I rated it a five because I can barely put the boon down.
B000SLP4SE|3.0|A fan of the star and director but it seemed like a bad edit of a decent film. As hackneyed as it sounds, ugh, &#34;Shooter&#34; misses it's mark. Not awful, but just something you can put on in the background while you cook or do dishes.
B00BAHKQW4|1.0|bought the game for the kindle fire and it installed no problem.got to the part were you enter a name.did that.only problem there was no way to enter the name when your done.no options on the keyboard or in game to enter name.you can't move past that screen so you can't play the game.I spent 2 dollars for a game I can't play.hope they fix it because I would like to play it,it looks fun.
B009O07NDY|3.0|Three important notes:<br />1. I wish the Lord of the Rings received this extended version treatment, instead of the $80 version. Too much Shore is never enough unless you are paying beacoup bucks...<br /><br />2. Piggybacking on what others have posted, this offering is \\"jerky\\" in the thematic sense. Unlike basically ALL of the three LOTR soundtracks, tracks do not blend seemlessly into each other, but rather startle, stop, and direct the listener into doubt--did the actual MOVIE feel this much of a crescendo/decrescendo? Were the soft and harsh tones of the film this chiasmused? I would feel worse about the overall listening experience, except that...<br /><br />3. This score is lavish, beautiful, intense and appropriate enough to the film to be special for the family. I enjoy listening to the music with my children, who have never seen the film but can imagine every moment because of the musical movements the score develops (the truest compliment a soundtrack can receive)...<br /><br />p.s. Could Shore have gotten the cast to sing the complete \\"Misty Mountain Song\\"? Such a haunting melody for only two verses? I know I am not alone...
B001UTW7QU|4.0|Lots of unexpected but welcome twists and turns. Very similar in that way to Lost. A bit contrived and too fast paced as compared to reality, but I guess this is what's required for a 1 hr show. Quite entertaining. Likeable characters, although they are just a wee bit too competent.
B009CCBCU4|2.0|This is not the type of historical fiction I prefer.  I didn't get very far into it before I decided it was probably going to be &#34;young adult&#34;.  Not that I don't enjoy some of that genre, but a conversation between two young boys that went &#34;No Way&#34;, &#34;Way&#34;, finished it for me.
B0094K1WZE|4.0|This action packed movie was very entertaining. However, it became very frustrating because it kept stalling and reloading. I finally gave up on Prime and switched over to Netflix, where it ran without a hitch.
B0037NVM1I|3.0|Thankfully this classic is as good as it is. If it wasn't such a great movie, I may have given it one star - on account of amazon's inability to provide the advertised HD quality. This issue with the prime movie service is well documented on the Amazon forums, so hopefully they fix it soon.
B007IK44CK|4.0|This show was fun to watch.  Not as good as some other Mission Impossible movies.  Enjoyed the fact that I did not have to take the movie back to a video machine or store.<br /><br />Thanks Amazon!
B0025WX2YW|5.0|Great show. Great season. Henry was a power hungry selfish ruler, and it makes for great television. The Boelyns finally got their due.
B0095P31L6|5.0|Kids love it, captivates them to watch it<br /><br />Would recommend to kids ages 7,8,9<br /><br />Not good for kids younger than that
B001UTW7QU|5.0|Season 1 is the least mind bending, as it builds in complexity exponentially. All around great series, just wish s05 was available. I'll just have to get it elsewhere.
B00B2H28SM|5.0|My favorite Tegan and Sara cd, the music is amazing! I can't stop listening to this cd because all the songs are incredible!
B003LSTK8G|4.0|This book is a facinating look behind the office doors of the movers and shakers in the big banking and investment firms involved in the financial collapse and the Great Recession that followed. Michael Lewis finds a way to tell the complete story in a very readable and enjoyable style that is not the norm in this genre.
B002L6I9Z4|5.0|Our son was a Lego fanatic when he was young.  Now, as a grown-up, he is into cameras. Therefore, this was the perfect Christmas gift.  He loved it.  My only complaint is that it comes assembled.  I was hoping he could have the fun of building it.
B004GHNIRK|5.0|very well written. it was good to read it before we went to see it as a family. Awesome Play.
B004GUSG4M|3.0|good idea, in fact quite novel (no pun intended) and took a lot of organization by the author.  Might have been as much fun to write as to read, since the author had to keep track of what the main character learned, or re-learned, each day.  It was a page-turner, though it got a little repetative toward the end.  The main character was quite well developed,but  the rest were not, so they ended up being rather wooden devices seving the story.  Part of my rating is based on my opinion that it got a little cheesy at the end.
B008ETOSYI|4.0|makes me wanna read the book. the movie is good, but i get the feeling that they left a lot more out then they should've. but of course i can over look that since (hottie) zac eforn is in it
B00AAX68HG|5.0|Pudding Monsters is so awesome!! I absolutely love this game, I play it all the time!! It's really quite great.
B0032CVAQQ|4.0|Very interesting concepts. I found myself reflecting on my past and relationships I observed of my friends. I think a key ingredient to the five languages is sincerity!
B00AE6SS5O|5.0|It is a fun game with different spearhead activities, puzzles, mat aching,  etc.  It is not so hard that you get stuck on a level.
B004HAG40O|5.0|I like to listen to alternative this is one of my favorite recent bands. I did not know about them until this cd. The sounds have a country folk feel with an alternative music vibe.
B004QZ9PLU|4.0|Typical of a Nicholas sparks novel, the best of me had interesting characters, plot twists, and a tear-jerking love story. Good read!
B00ARI9CDQ|5.0|i luv to read magazines, often i for get to buy the current issue, so i go to my kindle fire and there it is to buy ! cannot say enough about kindle fire hd, i have one and bought my sis one for her Christmas gift and we both have &#34;kindle fire HD' time every night when we go to bed ! Thankyou for  a great product and mailonline tablet ! its the best !
B007SGLZP8|3.0|I am a lawyer.  Sometimes the situations Grisham outlines don't seem realistic.  But it is fiction, so!  Writing style, so so.
B00993I6D2|2.0|George Orwell's powerful book on a bleak future just does not translate well to the screen. At least not in this adaptation. In fact, if you haven't read the book I doubt you'll have any idea what it's all about other than a really unpleasant society. Of course, 1984 is no longer a future date, but time seems to have passed this by.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|. . . Evernote. You cannot beat the price and convenience. Hands down the most cost effective way to say documents, photos and web pages conveniently. Puts DropBox to shame in price difference. I don't understand, after having tried both, why people would still go to DropBox. Maybe I am missing something but I highly recommend Evernote for business and personal use.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Once I started I couldn't put it down.  I already have the third book on my kindle and will start reading it immediately!
0345803507|5.0|I really liked the Fifty Shades series.  They were tastefully done and the fact that they were not &#34;smutty&#34; made them even better.  It was great to &#34;see&#34; Christian change over the series.  I only wish I could find a guy that cared about me like he cares about her.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|This is a fantastically thrilling series and an excellent second season.  I highly recommend this show to anyone interested in the strange.
B002N2LEVM|4.0|Very solid show. Enjoyed the concept, the acting, and the characters, but the second season definitely felt rushed.compared to the first. Understandable, and I felt like they definitely hit most of the important plot beats before cancellation, but also felt like some characters (Alpha, Boyd, Saunders, Topher) could have used more time to show what was going on in their heads. Also the Epilogue episodes were interesting and engaging but I'm not sure how I feel about them within the plot structure as I think they take something away from the &#34;present day&#34; narrative.
B00AREIAI8|2.0|i really do like it but on my kindle fire i install it it works fine but when i exit out of it i cant get back in very disappoing
B004KZOWEG|5.0|I got this book because I wanted a little more background on the Congo Free State before I read Heart of Darkness with my classes this year.  I got a lot more than a little.<br />This book brings the well-known characters in the Congo story to life and showcases the players who tried to wake the world up to the horrors going on there.  You will be haunted by what you read here, but it's worth it.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Wonderful story that follows an intriguing family. We should have more shows like this on so that the whole family could watch.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|this book, the whole series actually, is amazing. very well written and timeless. everyone should read this. no matter what age, race, or religion you are i promise you will get something out of this book. this story will stay with you and be one of those you will not likely forget and will recommend to friends.
B0000UJDLM|5.0|Wonderful movie!!!!  This is a movie that can be seen over and over again.  Wonderful plot!  Wonderful actors and actresses.  Totally great movie!
B0006J28MI|5.0|This is a great family and kid movie I had to purchase on DVD.  We had it on VHS and wore it out.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Like it..its a fun game to play. Grandkids love it. Recommend to parents to let their kids play it. They will like it
B00992CF6W|3.0|unable to connect with friends on wifi, no survival mode. didnt mind the price at all. i guess as long as you like nothing but building things this game is good. not great by a long shot!
B008HK3XKO|3.0|The first Marware Vibe case I got more times then not would not wake up my Kindle when I opened the lid.<br />So I returned it to Amazon which was so easy and they had me a new case the next day!!<br />This new one works fine and I love the quality and feel of the product.
B001RTSPVY|5.0|Very good series, DVD worked great, No problems. Would recommend if you like these kinda movies. Can't wait to find Season 5 and 6 at a reasonable rate.
B00AZL3PBK|4.0|It's all good my kids love it. They are 9 and 4 SO good range of age. I actually got into it for the fact it's like the original supper Mario bros. And that's my era. Good game. .
B0063GORYU|5.0|I really like this version of spider  solitaire.  It is easy to play, even on small screens, and you can win most of the time.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This book has everything I had hoped for, i dont want to give away any spoilers, so ill just say this book couldnt be more awesome
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love Subway Surfer!!! There's no tilting involved like Temple Run. It's a very fun game to play when you're bored. It's FREE so get it now!!!
B009IJJ5B4|5.0|I love this show.  Great rendering of Sherlock Holmes in the modern day world.  Amazons vid player works fine.  Cant wait for more episodes!
B004QZ9PLU|5.0|Nicholas Sparks is a GOD! Never a dull moment ...pretty sure I never put the book down. Dawson Cole...what a dream!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|it feels like I have a real horse named beauty. and it is the best game I ever had so I really like it
B0076DCT2G|4.0|Love the character John Corey and his way of handling problems.  Wish there were actual people like him.  Its fun to read
B000JMKTLO|3.0|Because of the subject matter, I would hesitate to recommend it to everyone.  It was suspenseful and held your interest, but made me uncomfortable sometimes.
B00499QUK2|5.0|Modern telling, fast paced and fun to watch especially for those who remember to old 40's serials with Basil Rathbone.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|great story line, i can not wait until June when amazon gets the next season so i can continue the story.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Great game always something different to experience with missions and challenges. Good for helping learn timing and concentration. I love the fast pace and graphics. Fun for both adults and children.
B00942XS04|4.0|Great movie. Child appropriate. The digital quality is great. My daughter liked that Mater was in the movie so much!
B005HEXQN2|3.0|While this season has a lot of great episodes, the last few seem VERY rushed. It destroys the natural flow of the series with forced character development and convenient resolutions.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Love the caharacter actors especially maggie smith. The location is interesting also and the costumes zzzzzzzzzzzzzzz zzzzzzz.zzzzz zzzzzz.zzz zzzzz zzz
B005PK56TA|5.0|Edgy, scary and unpredictable. Very good acting by almost the entire cast. Constantly pushing the boundaries of what TV can do
B0044XV3R8|5.0|Glad I waited for the extended edition to come out! Lots of special effect info that is very interesting!  Loved the movie when I saw it in the theater, and love it even more now that I can watch it whenever I want!
B0095P3ULC|5.0|Transformers: Dark of the moon is a great feature film which keeps you on the edge of your seat!!! I would recommend this movie to anyone, the movie is total excitement!!!
B002UM5BXW|4.0|Very informative about kitchen and restaurant back end dealings.  Now I know why the cooks were so abusive when I waited on tables during my college years.  Too much talk about himself, or it would have been 5 stars.
B0041KBWM0|5.0|Great rendition of the book, if you love the movie Emma, this series is a must! The characters were very believable, the setting well portrayed!
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I forget the cast is even acting! I haven't watched television in years but can't stop watching this show. Definitely recommend.
B00821PCJS|5.0|Really Good show. Just started watching it on Friday and now on to the second season. The walking dead's good too
B006MW3UZW|5.0|The characters, production value, scenery, costumes and story lines are all a magic combination to create total entertainment.As good as Upstairs Downstairs with some wry humor blended in. Not to be missed!!!
B0017SWPXY|5.0|started reading it one night, had to finish it the same night. Definitely had to hug my dog afterwards, really touching story.
B0063IH60K|3.0|Thought I could play more than one game- it's only one type of solitaire. Boring! If you like to keep playing the same game this is for you
B00B2V66VS|5.0|best game ever. Great graphics I &lt;3 this game sooooooo great. I have temple run I wonder if they would come out with temple run 3? :/ well bye;)
B0013F1D02|5.0|I didn't think I would like it when a friends little girl brought it over to watch.  I sat threw the intire thing and enjoyed it.  It was creative, and happy.  I think it's a new clasic and I have no clue why more people haven't watched it.
B000URWYTS|4.0|Thoroughly enjoyed the novel and another interpretation of the man behind the architecture I have appreciated for years, even while thinking he wasn't a very nice man.
B008BQ8VOC|5.0|We bought this after we started watching a show on TV this year and wondered what was going on.  We were able to get Season One at the Library, but the only way to get the 10 shows of Season Two we had missed was through Amazon.  We are so hooked, that we had a couple of marathon sessions. Love the characters, lots of strong women on the show.  Louis Litt is a fabulous \\"Rat,\\" his facial expressions are so spot on.  Many characters have great senses of humor and the writing is wonderful.  Good TV, and a show to look forward to.  Highly recommend it.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|addictive, but not easy as you think. got stuck in a few places, but keep playing,  & you'll get it!
B007J4T2G8|1.0|This is one of the most overrated fiction I have ever come across. No substance, no literature and nothing whatsoever  writing is all about. In one of the freakish accidents and sheer luck in the literary sphere the author went through a spiral cascading from one silly reader to the next recommending the book as if it is the next best thing after DH Lawrence. The author should try her luck on national lottery than taking up writing.<br />I wasted my money on the trilogy, I am ashamed to keep it in my book shelf and I find it rather insulting to give it to someone as a gift. So I am burning it. What a waste of time and money.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|this covers my whole screen on my Kindle. simple and easy to see and use. would definitely recommend. love it
B009G78EE2|5.0|Just bought this album after hearing \\"thrift shop\\" tens of times. At first, I waas amazed that was not even close to the best song on the album. Nearly every song has a powerful, positive message - social justice issues are rarely raised in hip hop, and when they are it's usually to promote consumerism, killing, drinking, gangs, etc. After a quick listen, it's apparent that Macklemore is a very intelligent and well-grounded dude who has overcome some serious demons. There's really not a bad track on this album - white walls is a little out of place in it's message but still a good rap song. As a Seattleite, I'm really proud to see Macklemore's making an impact on hip hop in such a unique and powerful way.
B00683JK9K|4.0|fun puzzle, change it up & make more pieces, graphics are great on HD, would definitely recommend, keeps you busy
0140557741|5.0|I bought this to cut up and use in a group project. The activity was well liked, and the book arrived quickly and in good shape.
B006LSZECO|3.0|The wife disappears and the husband is blamed. The more I read, the less I liked either one. Both are liars and game-players.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|great graphics and really hard to play. a step up from the first one :) you get to go into a mine which is really different from the first temple run. if you like the first temple run you should really test your skills with temple run 2! :)
B00821PCJS|4.0|Similar to Revolution, but with an interesting twist. It's definitely worth a look if you're interested in post apocalyptic sci-fi.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Well it's definitely fun, but it can use up a lot of time as you try &#34;just one more time&#34; to try to beat the current level.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|The story might be a good one if it wasn't so poorly written.  I felt like I was reading a 13 year old teen's diary.  There was no substance to the story.  Even the sex scenes were poorly written.  I really don't understand why there was so much hype about this book.
B000001GPW|5.0|Great works, great interpreters.  I prefer the first concerto and the second, the third is quite different, Bartok returns to his first love, Liszt.  Martin
B001F6TXME|5.0|This product works great with my Nikon D5100 too.  Half press to focus, full press to shoot, and lock to hold shutter open.  Simple and a must have for long exposure shots.
B005FWO3QK|5.0|The voices are good, the conductor, you can't ask for better nowadays.  Daniel Barenboim is a great conductor.  I recommen this version very much.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|Loved this  book! Not really a Stephen King fan but, I couldn't put this book down. My wife loved it too. Kind of long, but hated for it to end. King makes you feel like you are there.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|One of my all time favourite authors and books. Can't wait for the next book in the series.  I wish she could write faster. Love her work!!!!!!! So many twists and the characters were easy to love!!
B005PK56TA|5.0|Surprised that I loved the season.  It was creepy with a great storyline. Ready for season two at the asylum.
B0094K1K42|2.0|I love Charlize Theron but I just did not really care for this movie.  I would not put it on my must see list.
B007MB5OCE|3.0|Don't like to much the switching between timeperiods, but still a nice and symple novel....<br />You get some hard and some good times with this book:)
B005LAIH2C|4.0|Of the three recent H&G films, this one is certainly the best. I enjoyed the film up until I understood what was happening, and at that point the film makers couldn't bring it home. The movie looked like it was shot on the same set of \\"Red Riding Hood.\\" It had medieval gadgetry including a fully automatic spear tip thrower. I felt like this was a Riding Hood companion film, just not as good in spite of Gemma's cleavage.<br /><br />As famous witch hunters, H&G have their own groupies.They are hired by the mayor because of a rash of child disappearances, which we quickly find out is for a special ceremony. The dialouge was so-so. I couldn't help think of a line from LOTR when Hansel says, \\"Evil is upon you if you like it or not.\\" Indeed much of the script feels like it is borrowed and written for tweens. The witches in this film are very powerful. They travel through the woods at speeds which look like \\"Twilight\\" vampires. A film for teens.<br /><br />Parental Guide: F-bombs (at least 2 by Gemma Arterton) No sex. Nudity (Pihla Viitala) 3 1/2 stars
B003G8Y4QO|5.0|If you love old school sci fi you'll love it. Has all the special effects of modern film but with characters that look like they come from a old film.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|You should definitely read this book. It was compelling and funny with  the perfect amount of<br />love. I tea d this in just a couple of hours and was never disappointed in a day wasted away in reading this book. And hell, it was free and good, what could be better :)
B00992CF6W|4.0|I really liked the look of it not only for the different textures but for the look of 8 bit. But when I was using it, it glitched so it would never stop acting like I was pressing and holding (control for deleting blocks and charged shots for the bow) so I had to reboot it.
B0086213XW|3.0|Definitely not a memorable movie but it wasn't awful. It had a decent premise and kept my interest but I highly doubt I will ever watch it again.
B009VA1FN6|5.0|I loved this book. I really liked they way the plot was traced back through the years.  I liked it so much that as soon as I finished it I ordered another Kate Morgan book which I am currently reading and enjoying, but not as much as The Secret Keeper
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Awesome book! Could not put it down! Told several friends about it and they all loved it! You must read this book!!!
B0040I09RM|5.0|A friend of mine recommended that I watch this show as it is one of her favorites. Not being much of a tv buff, I had overly high expectations that were easily met by this series. I am hooked!
B0088W4YTK|5.0|The storyline held up good. There were some interesting twists. Overall a good season for Startgate Atlantis. Watch this and enjoy.
0142403873|5.0|My 3 year old son loves this book!! Such a great story and the movies based on the books and narrated by Helena Bonham Carter are adorable. I just ordered the Gruffalo's child and I'm sure we will love it just as much!
0765325950|3.0|After 14-15 books and multiple million words, I finally finished the Wheel of Time series today.  Keep in mind, this is not a stand alone book... nor is it meant to be.  For the best feel I started with the Eye of the World and worked my way to what was, in my opinion, a mostly unsatisfying conclusion.  Let me start out by saying I enjoy well crafted and indeed long series, with well fleshed out characters and multiple well thought out storylines.  I'll keep this brief, with no spoilers.<br /><br />Let me start with the good points of the book... I wish I could come up with more than 2.  The main story line was brought to a well thought out and, I felt, satisfying conclusion.  While I hate to put it this way, at least after 20+ years it's finally over.<br /><br />Other than the main story line, don't go into this book expecting all the answers, or even most of the answers.  Characters, with 1000s of words devoted to developement are discarded in a few paragraphs(or a sentence as the case may be).  Story lines with entire normal length books equivalent don't get so much as a \\"and she rode off into the sunset\\" put forth to conclude them.  Overall, while I didn't go into the final book feeling the series was, as many put it, bloated... by the time I saw how the characters and story lines were disposed of I concluded that this should have been a trilogy instead of whatever it ended up as(is there a word for a series this long?).<br /><br />I expect that this is the way that I would feel if the Lord of the Rings series had it ended on the same page that Frodo destroyed the Ring.  I said that I'd keep it brief and I will, if for no other reason than that I have wasted more than enough of my time on this series.  I read it once, start to end, but I doubt I will ever pick it up again.
B00ADIT8U2|4.0|I enjoyed this game more than any other like it. It was challenging but not enough to aggravate and make you have to search for a walk through to complete it. If you do need help, there are in-game hints. The thing that really stumped me was the door in the saloon so, FYI: you don't need to find a key for it, just go on to your next step. The reason for four stars instead of five, is that it could be longer. It only took a few hours to complete. But worth a couple bucks for the fun : )
B008YWY0HK|4.0|I LOVED this movie at the theatre....so, I bought the DVD for frequent viewing. Yet I don't find my self watching it often. I am glad I bought it though. The visuals are fantastic...the setting and theme are unique...the story is positive and uplifting. It would probably have more &#34;repeat&#34; appeal if I were a kid...
B009VSW15Y|1.0|i can't take any pictures of anything but myself.  if i can someone tell me how to do it, so i know what to do.
B005LAIISA|2.0|I love kids movies...quality ones that is. Like Finding Nemo, Cars, The Incredibles...etc. I enjoyed the first 3 Ice Age Movies. Each one an entertaining and unique experience. But the 4th Ice Age is kind of bland...kind of a yawn. I found it easy to leave the room without pausing the DVD so I didn't miss anything when I went for snacks. I didn't connect with the characters or story like I have with the others...didn't really care what happened. Seemed more like an &#34;After School Special&#34; than a Blockbuster...
B00AAX68HG|5.0|Macht Spass,fordert den Geist und ist sehr niedlich gestaltet.soweit ich gespielt habe auch für Kinder geeignet.kann ich nur empfehlen und deshalb 5 sterne
B001HN6922|5.0|Definitely a Blockbuster quality movie...the kind you want to watch over and over...if that's your thing. Lives up to quality of Cars 1...Great Characters and clever premise...
B003L77G6A|5.0|I couldn't stop laughing.  Amy Farah Fowler just adds to the awesome characters already established.  I'm still waiting to actually see Howard's mom, Leonard's dad, and Penny's mom.
B004V2S4SS|5.0|I've loved this show from the start...very believable premise and characters...feel like I &#34;know&#34; them. Not happy at all that it ended...but why end it this way?? Totally depressing and not at all true to life...disappointing:(
B006TAJ8IU|2.0|The Crocs Duet Sport Clog was not soft, supportive, flexible or a good fit.<br />This shoe is light in weight.<br />This is a very nice looking clog. It's looks fooled me. They sure looked like they would be comfortable. They look like a 100% rubber (NOT).<br />I have never seen a clog so wide in width, they were too long and wide.<br />However, if this company would make this very nice looking clog in 100% rubber (soft and flexible) and in a correct U.S.A. standard shoe size, I would buy them, after all, this style was my pick over many others I shopped for.<br />The price was way too high for the low comfort level.
B005LAIH4A|2.0|Love Dr,Seuss books....not a fan of this movie though. Very little character build and story seems matter-of-fact, predictable even. Maybe little kids would get more out of this...but I don't consider it Blockbuster material...more like straight-to-video...<br />Gave it to a friend for their kids...
B005FISC52|5.0|This completes my daughter's dvd set.  She is very happy.  She has enjoyed watching this on her time as she is a college student.
0764169742|5.0|still reading, but i'm sure will be very helpful. lots of good tips and i like the examples provided of other artists work.
1400049628|5.0|This was a fun book to read.<br /><br />I wished there had been a little more information as to the origination of Solanum... The author says scientists can't find it in nature, but then where did it come from?<br /><br />In survival books i need and love lists and this book had all the lists i could ask for. I especially liked the part about preparing a shelter.  Breaking the stairs is one of the most ingenious ideas that when you hear it you think to yourself that its so obvious no one realizes it.<br /><br />I would have liked some more survival tips or scenarios or lists instead of the journal of possible zombie incidents at the end of the book (which seemed more like a prologue to world war Z) but i still really enjoyed the book.<br /><br />Great buy for anyone who likes zombie lore
B00AOCLWF6|5.0|I like the story line. It's about something that could happen to earth. Hopefully not. Acting is great, very good cast. Just love it.
B000GCG59W|4.0|I first discovered Buika through the Music of the World collections, which I also recommend, put together by the late BBC radio DJ Charlie Gillett (R.I.P.).  Buika is a unique vocal talent, and many of the arrangements for her songs are, I find, quite captivating.  \\"Mi Manera\\" alone is worth the price of the CD!  What an absolutely beautiful piece of music!
B0094K1MH2|3.0|The animation and voice acting were great.  But both my wife and I lost interest in several parts.  Didn't really care for the stereotype drunk Russian (and no I am not Russian).  Not sure if a drunk character is really appropriate for children.<br />The dog was the best part.
B0079R8KO0|2.0|WAS DISAPPOINTED BECAUSE FOUR DAYS AFTER I RECEIVED THE PRODUCT THE STRAP TO HOLD THE TABLET IN PLACE TORE OFF, DON'T KNOW IF THIS HAPPENS TO ALL OF THESE COVERS OR IF MINE WAS JUST A DEFECTIVE ONE. ALSO IT SAYS WITH STAND, MY COVER LOOKS NOTHING LIKE THE PICTURE SHOWN, THE ONLY STAND IS THE COVER ITSELF, WHICH DOES NOT WORK WELL AT ALL.
B005ERIRZE|5.0|Excellent book to understand why we don't always do what is in our best interest. Powerful book to help you achieve your goals
B004O3YGMC|4.0|It works well, i would like it to act as a second monitor for my pc.  It does what it says on the box!
B0014JKJJI|5.0|i have worn these every day since they arrived last week.  i am recovering from surgery and i wear these around the house, going outside, to the store, doctor's, everywhere. Comfortable and a little warmer than the regular vented model in winter. Great value product.
0393337170|5.0|One of the most interesting and captivating reads I have purchased in a long time. Definitely a page-turner and best book of the year!
B001KQGEKS|5.0|I've owned this recording it most formats: vinyl, cassette, CD.<br />Now I have the digital AND Compact Disc of this masterpiece.<br />I was careful to purchased the UK import of the &#34;cleaned up&#34; Collectors' s Edition.<br />And it is beautiful.<br /><br />Factory Records did a masterful job at giving us the entire album and the bonus 12&#34; remixes/ B-sides in a two disc set in a pristine version.<br /><br />I wont review the songs - that's been done over the last 30 years.<br />But if you are a New Order fan, you have to get it.  PCL, Low-Life, and Brotherhood (no, I did not accidentally omit Technique) are the Triple Crown of the N.O. catalog.  Essential additions.<br /><br />Enjoy!
0446563048|3.0|Not a bad book, but not too engaging. Was hoping for some more insight from Tony, but seemed more like a personal diary (that is a bit of an exaggeration) on his journey.
B003VANOFY|5.0|When I first got this I plugged it into the side of my Dell monitor. I am convinced that it is not a powered hub that is built into the monitor and **this makes a huge difference**. When I did this I would get dropouts constantly. As a tech person, I was convinced that it wasn't the hardware or software specifically. I scoured the logitech forums and people were saying stuff about interference with wifi and other devices on the same wireless range. Well I did have a router right next to me so I decided to unplug it. That didn't solve the dropout problems and changing the channel on my other routers didn't help at all.<br /><br />Finally, I just got a powered hub and dropouts are now very rare. The problem it seemed that where I had plugged it in simply didn't provide enough power to the device to operate correctly. If you are experiencing issues - use the included USB extender and plug it directly into your computer or buy a powered hub. I actually use the powered hub with the extender :).<br /><br />Out of all headphones I've ever used - this is probably the most comfortable. I can use it for hours and not hurt. I wear glasses and I can still wear them comfortably. I generally use it for listening to music and gaming.
1591396190|5.0|Reveals concepts that are actually simple and common sense, yet no one actually takes the time to apply or even think about them. A real eye-opener.
B008IYR2BA|3.0|I really enjoyed all the other Dexter seasons, since the idea of a likable serial killer is great and makes for interesting stories. Unfortunately, this season is not as good. Religiously motivated killings with keys to the murderer that can be found in the bible - this theme is so overused that even Dexter can't make it interesting.
0385535147|4.0|`The Racketeer\\" is written by John Grisham and that tells 99% of the story.  It is fast paced, filled with interesting characters, and has a surprise ending.<br /><br />I've lost count of the number of Grisham books I've read. \\"A Time to Kill\\" was my first and I became an instant fan. But I don't read every one.<br /><br />When he deviated from genre and wrote \\"A Painted House,\\" I followed. I am an eclectic reader that enjoys what many call \\"literary\\" books.  I was pleased to find that John Grisham could abandon the world of lawyers and court rooms and delve into the nitty-gritty of human nature.<br /><br />Before I started reading his latest, I perused Grisham's author revelation that he had spent little time in research. I thought, \\"This could be interesting\\". So I just sat back and following his imagination.  And what a ride!  For a quick, fun read with lots of twists and turns, try \\"The Racketeer.\\"
B005JR3Y5W|2.0|I watched this show because a friend recommended it to me. It's a very typical soap-sitcom about dating and relationships. So if you like this, go ahead and watch it. Otherwise, stay away.
B005LAIHXQ|5.0|this is a really good movie... especially if you are a big fan of the Alien movies...  I recommend this one
B00406TRU4|5.0|This is a retelling of the familiar Arthur-Merlin legend in a rather unfamiliar way. At the beginning, all characters are quite different from the way they are usually portrayed (for example, prince Arthur is an ill-bred brat, Guinevere is a sweet but fickle servant). During the show one can watch the characters develop into their 'usual selves', all while fun and exciting adventures happen!
B0076DCT2G|4.0|As always, John Corey is hilarious. My only critique of the book is that it is too long (and, at times, tediously detailed) AND the John Corey smart ass humor gets a little old. Otherwise, the suspense and plot line is excellent.
B008AK8FHM|4.0|Easy to understand.  An outstanding experience shared with the world.  Hopefully we will all realize soon what a wonderful universe surrounds us.
B007HACDLK|4.0|Vince Flynn strikes again: fast paced, intense, lots of twists, turns and surprises; all in all - a great read.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|This was a good and quick read. I enjoyed the characters and the storyline. It got a little predictable towards the end, but it didn't ruin the book.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Characters are well written and captivating. It proves the power of gossip and misunderstandings. I'm glad I was born late in the 20th century
B00APUYWYA|3.0|My preteen daughter loved it but my son, also preteen, did not. It was boring but the music was fine
B003Z49LYO|4.0|I prefer this version to any other. Very well done. Eddie Redmayne was Angel, you could feel his struggle. LOVE
B006MW3V6U|5.0|It took me a while to join the Downton Abbey craze...period history is not my &#34;thing&#34;.  But, with the temptation of watching it free with Amazon Prime, I decided to try it...now I'm hooked!  The characters are very well developed and the plot keeps you on the edge of your seat!!
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Excellent series, I was hooked from season 1. The insight into the aristocracy and the servants is addicting.  I couldn't wait for the next episode to find out what was going on in all of their lives. Everything in that era seems to be so much more dignified, even the traumas. I recommend this program, definitely a must to watch.
B003JTHXOK|2.0|I have rad a lot of Nicholas Sparks books, but this one didn't impress me much.  The story was too predictable, but I did like the twist at the end,
B00ADS90EQ|5.0|New favorite movie.  Great songs. Good love story. Just an all around good movie.  Makes you wish you were young and in college again.
B0054R6BFM|5.0|This book is not what I expected. I loved it though. I have never read anything like this. I gave it 5stars because who would have guest all this from the title or the description...:):):);)
B00BB9PVQM|4.0|Dark. Almost too dark. Yet, I keep watching. So, does anyone else suspect Agent Debra Parker is a \\"follower\\"? I am not sure that the \\"second youngest agent\\" on the team isn't one too. Perhaps the reason it is such a compelling show is that it is unpredictable.
B0063IH60K|5.0|This classic solitaire game is exactly what it should be.  Easy to use.  Good distraction when waiting for me, Good for my kids learning numbers.
B003YNFYD8|5.0|Classic Beatles...  This was a gift for the kids.  Shipped on time and a fair price.  I would us this company again. Also picked up the Red album.
B008MEM24S|3.0|A fun game that is a good way to spend time. Some of the puzzles are easy others will take a few times to get done.
B006LSZECO|3.0|Gone Girl was a little too cheesy.  Too much fantasy.  vocabulary and structure were good.  The female lead was unbelievable, other characters were more recognizable.
B000HZED8S|5.0|liked the scenery, liked the story line, like the twist (you'll get it when you see it), like the characters, liked the graphics. wish there was a sequel.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|This game plays like most other free games with in app purchases. I like that I don't have to pay unless I want to. However I don't like that some of the quests require friend sharing.
B007XIC1GI|2.0|Manson's book is a self indulgent trip through cocaine addiction. Not too bad. I would like him to write a new book every ten years.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|The different story line from the first season did not bother me a bit. I loved Season 2 as much as I love Season 1. Love the plot, the story line, the acting, and the actors/actresses.
B002RI9X8S|5.0|I read this book because I love the Springsteen song, 'The Ghost of Tom Joad.' This book is rightfully regarded as an American classic. Highly recommended.
B0095R6OBS|3.0|Short but cute. I enjoyed the newer one more. More story to enjoy. For 2 dollars it was worth the money.
B007N85POS|5.0|I love this game! It has the storyline of the movie and it's a little bit easier than the original but I think its better and it's more additive.
B00AQ3K8IU|3.0|This was a simple read and gave me something to read for a few trips to work on the subway.
0743270754|5.0|A book that captivates from the beginning to the very end...you will literally lose hours reading this book! A must read of history that shows Lincoln's sheer analytical awareness of lucidity!
B000KJU182|5.0|This is a wonderful interpretation of the story by Herman Melville - a disturbing reflection on the nature of natural innocence, natural evil, and the duties of political officials. All the actors are outstanding, and Peter Ustinov's direction is superb. The cover art is misleading, as the movie is black and white.
B00AJLHU3K|5.0|Of course, Richard Thompson fans must/will buy this.  I hope some that are not yet fans will as well - it will likely start many on an astounding backwards trek through his amazing catalogue. RT has never put out an album that wasn't at least pretty good.  Electric is better than pretty good.  It is excellent.  It is better than his previous release, Dream Attic, which was very good but not quite as good as Mock Tudor, Old Kit Bag, or Sweet Warrior to mention only relatively recent releases.  The consistency of quality of the songs and performances here is probably rivaled only by Mock Tudor.<br />Although Electric actually has a pretty good balance of rock and folk, it will probably especially appeal to those (like me) who particularly enjoy RT's electric guitar playing.  There are 5 songs here (Stony Ground, Sally B, Stuck on the Treadmill, Good Things Happen to Bad People, and Straight and Narrow) that it is easy to imagine RT extending the guitar solo into one of those epic performances during a concert (a la Can't Win, Put it There, Pal, or, best of all, Hard on Me).  Yet there are plenty of softer songs as well and they are equally good.  The Gordon Lightfoot-esque Salford Sunday and My Enemy are personal favorites.  I am also surprised to say that my favorite song of all is the country-flavored Saving the Good Stuff for You.  It's a great way to end the CD on a truly uplifting note.  Of course, the bonus songs are excellent as well.  Will You Dance, Charlie Boy may remind some of RT/Swarbrick interplay and I Found a Stray is both haunting and beautiful.<br />I hope Electric and the upcoming tour gain Richard Thompson some new fans.  He deserves them.  I certainly can't imagine he has ever lost a fan once he has gained one.
B00007KQA3|5.0|I have always been impressed by this film adaptation of Orwell's book. The movie is great, dark and unsettling, with a disturbingly good performance by Richard Burton.
B0019M5XN2|1.0|My boys looked forward to this movie arriving for WEEKS (literally, an item I had ordered days later arrived a week BEFORE this one!) Once it arrived I put it in their DVD player, and it couldn't be played in our area. Basically the movie was TRASH (which is right where it ended up)  I came back to see if this had been stated by the seller (and it had) in very small print, I feel like I was fooled intentionally (they knew someone purchasing this would likely miss that) it is also stated ON the DVD case itself that it is of foreign format...It should have been put somewhere where the buy can clearly see this is a waste of time, and money....I don't reccomend purcasing this unless you look very very closely at what you're getting....And also, sellers....Don't sell a movie IN THE UNITED STATES if it CANNOT BE PLAYED IN THE UNITED STATES! My kids were terribly disappointed, as was I....
B006MW3V6U|5.0|This show is incredible. Fantastic writing, fantastic \\"set\\" and the wardrobe is to die for.<br />I can't wait for the next season.
B00AEJM6H2|3.0|Fun but very similar to other games I play.  I like games like Candy Crush better.  I do like the bright color s.
B009GED3HS|5.0|Still finishing the season, but so far season 8 is just as awesome as the rest of the seasons!  Awesome show.
B002U3CCBK|2.0|To be honest, I started disliking this book the minute I realized it wasn't a true story. I can't remember any more why I thought it was a true story but I did.<br /><br />The book has its moments of humour, especially the letters of the Al Qaeda members; but overall, it falls more into the category of absurd than funny.<br /><br />More frustrating, was the stereotyped characters- a wife who cares only about her career and money; a lonely, naive scientist and a glamorous, successful woman with the hidden faithful heart of gold.
0618154248|5.0|He loves curious George , but cannot watch tv too often, so I figured these could substitute. Which they have worked, obviously not the same as the show.They a perfect for his little hands in the car and in bed. I'll probably get the second set as some point. Never too many books!
0553801473|4.0|I liked this one much more than book 4 and I feel it recaptured the vision of the first three.  That being said it is still typical GRRM, lots of characters, and times where you will think they will never come back to a certain place or person.  I am not sure why but I had a hard time finishing the fourth book and it was quite opposite of this one.  Do not read it too fast though because it l
B0098VYCCE|5.0|it is unique and the family liked it, it takes alot to keep m y family watching and this movie did
B008FPOIT6|5.0|I just loved this book. Couldn't put it down. Very fast read- lighthearted and fun but mysterious. I can't wait to discuss it in my book club.
B00AMBH70S|5.0|I saw the very first of these movies and I like this one as much as the first, I recomend this one to.
B002M9WW30|5.0|I don't need a lot of extras.  Just give me the movies.  These are great and I got them for only $20!  It was a steal and they are Blu-Ray.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Temple run 2 is so amazing that I kinda stop playing subway suffers my favorite game ever but when people started talkin about temple run 2 I was like omg that's a great game now I play it 247 everyday I mean woooooow it's great If u read this please remember to download temple run 2 then on weekends or when ever u can play it 247.... aka I soooo approve this game five stars
0743201140|5.0|This book is really great. It will help you to know you better and to identify your natural behaviors. I bought Strengths Finder 2.0 and I really don't recommend that book. In this one you will get the background of the researchers of these theories, helping you understand why it does work.<br /><br />The Strengths Finder 2.0 test is quite better than the once provided my Now, Discover Your Strengths, but most important that a talents priority scales (which I think depends more on the question that you get than the test) is the explanation of the theory.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|The graphics are AMAZING, and it feels like you are taking care of a real horse. There is absolutely nothing wrong with it!
B004LWZW42|5.0|DVD in perfect condtion. Great addition to the series. Watch this and the other 3 movies over and over again. Love James McAvoy. Ordered Wolverine.
B00992CF6W|5.0|ITS SSSOOO AWSOME AND I GOT THE 6.0.6 ALPHA!!!!!!  JUST GO TO<br />JOIN GAME AND WAIT A LITTLE BIT AND YOU WILL GET THE 6.0.6!!!!! ARMOR AND NETERRACK AND LEATHER AND NETHER PORTAL!!!!!!! SIGNS TO!!!!  RECOMMEND THAT YOU GET IT!!!!!<br />KEEP IT UP MOJANG AND SUTUP VICKY!!!
B001DHXT20|5.0|DVD in perfect condition. The tributes to the TV show, which I watched religiously as a kid, are a great touch.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|The finale of the series was not as energizing as the others. I was a bit disappointed with the war and betrayal going on and on. While it was an interesting read it was not a constant page turner like the first two books. Nonetheless the ending was satisfying.
B001DTPZNY|5.0|DVD in perfect condition. Watch all the Indiana Jones movies over and over again. Rarely is a sequel as good as the first movie, so I didn't expect this one to be any better than it is. I'm just looking to be entertained, I don't need to be amazed.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is a really good game its cool to I love to play it that  how much fun it is
B00A9X9TIW|2.0|We did  not care for this movie.  Over hyped with the emphasis on Bruce Willis.  Interesting story line/concept, justt could have used better acting.
B0094K1MH2|3.0|looking forward to really getting to watch it uninterrupted some time soon.  the three stars is just my guess for now
B004LROUNG|4.0|Another fun legal romp where the sleazy lawyer with a heart of gold pulls success from the jaws of failure.<br /><br />Well-written but not one of his best.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Fun game!I would recommend this to any and everyone. This game is very easy to control and to navigate through.
B0094K1WZE|5.0|Great special effects!  A charged up action packed Mission well acted by Cruise.  This MI could revive the series again if they keep this up in future films.
B001XV09UG|2.0|Not a great Stanley Kubrick film but not one of the worst films I have ever saw...  Surprised at the caliber of film stars who were in it...  As expensive and the long production time as it took to make this film... it should have been far better...
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I loved it .the horses are beautiful. there is even. a unicorn. It so hos ramble Colorado all over it.  I haven't. won enough contests to get it though. I am getting there though. so yeah awesome game. you have to get it.
B005721W9O|5.0|This is a movie I can watch over and over, with lots of gags and puns that seem as classic as the series it parodies.  The whole thing is cleverly done with special effects that are just polished enough for you to suspend disbelief, while never so daunting that you take it seriously.  Any Star Trek fan should be delighted, and there's enough there for the next generation to enjoy at face value too.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|fun and addicting. i keep saying, &#34;this is my last run&#34;.<br />would have given 5 stars but sometimes it doesnt read my swipes correctly which can be really irritating if you've gotten far. well worth downloading
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Very fun and the horse looks real but most items cost gems which you get one after every level but other than that this game is super fun
B009LL4LMM|5.0|this is a fun app with great characters. it gets harder as you go on but you dont have to start all over. you cann keep trying the same screen without penalty. you dont have to purchase in app items, which i hate in an app.
B00AREIAI8|3.0|I think this is an okay game but it does get boring after a while. It does have plenty to do so I think it is a good game for being a freebie
B004FOA84A|5.0|great puzzle game. works great on kindle fire hd 7&#34;.  you have to back to rooms several times after finding items. rooms have great visuals. you do not have to purchase in app items with real money which i hate in an app
B009IJJ5B4|4.0|I am a HUGE fan of the BBC show &#34;Sherlock,&#34; so I really did not expect to like this show. I watched it because a friend urged me to watch it and I was surprised to find that not only was I able to watch it without comparing the two shows, but I actually quite liked it. It is NOTHING like &#34;Sherlock,&#34; so I do not find myself comparing the two shows or the two lead characters at all. This show approaches the famous Sherlock homes from a completely unexpected angle and I find it highly entertaining. I do still prefer the BBC version, but I find that I can't help but wait for the next episode of &#34;Elementary.&#34;
B0073LWEXK|5.0|i love these typt of puzzle games. works great on kindle fire hd  7&#34;. you do not have to purchase in app items which i hate in apps
B00AESN8XY|5.0|I downloaded the free version on my phone and was disappointed to find out that you had to pay to use what you unlocked. When I found out it only cost $0.99, I was thrilled. I love this app. it is a great time killer and still quite a challange. A strategy can work at one difficulty in a stage, and be completely useless at the next stage. it is not all the same. I love how each stage is VERY different, and that each level is different in each stage. love it!
B007XKEY6Q|1.0|i imediately  deleted after it asks for email or facebook. never played it. dont download if you dont want to give an email ofr facebook
B00B2V66VS|4.0|entertaining. excellent graphics for a free game.definately challenging.once you start it is hard to put down.the bonuses you earn enhance the game experience.
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|Got this for my grandkids  age 3 and 5 to play but turns out I like it as much as they do.
B001ANSSDC|4.0|An enjoyable read with a quirky take - sometimes a little predictable but overall I enjoyed this and would recommend it.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Hopeless was an easy read. It is excellent for teens, The story didn't jump around and make it hard to follow.
B007PT3QOQ|1.0|I was very disappointed with this game. I thought my eight year old grandson would like it, but it is just another version of FarmVille. Just not as much fun. Years ago I played a game on a computer at a workshop for teachers that was called Oregon Trail and it was much more fun. I really can't recommend this game to anyone.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game it's fun additive it's the best game ever I also like the fact that it's also an competition I love it
B00AREIAI8|5.0|my kindle fire is acting up, so I have to restart it in order to open the app. however, when the app does open, it is kinda neat. probably one of the better horse games iv played. a little inaccurate when it comes to owning and training horses but, pretty good otherwise.
B00992CF6W|5.0|It didnt give me the update<br />And my friend got it on his kindle hd and i think its not fair
B009CPJHY4|5.0|This movie is simply excellent. The actors are among the best. The dialogue is exquisite--I'd love to read the script! If you are approaching retirement, or already there, you'll find many issues to discuss long after the movie is over. Even those more youthful viewers are introduced to life/culture in India--those infamous call centers!--and the policy issue of out-sourcing medical care. Yes, I'll watch it over & over and see something new every time!
B0013V33DG|5.0|Donizetti's La Fille du regiment.<br />Juan Diego Florez and Natalie Dessay are outstanding, lively, animated, passionate as actors and musically perfect.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|THE Status of Eden is a great game!! I love it and can't wait until the next edition of the game comes out.. Please create the next edition of this game as soon as possible so that I can buy and enjoy that game as well..
B009NPA3Q4|5.0|Love this new singer., He will be around for awhile., Nice soothing music, can't wait for his next album, will collect them all.
1616550414|5.0|An awesome book with awesome art and lots of information! Hardcover, and the Gate of Time on the front side is glittering. Very nice! Good work you brought it here, big N!
B005S9EJ14|5.0|this is a great movie, not full of blood and gore. Good story, wonderful actors....loved it.......Highly reccomended for those not wanting high action but good story......
B004SBS8LA|4.0|Fun game to play while waiting in the Dr's. Office... Ready, aim, fire and &#34;hope&#34; to free all the birds!
B008UFUOH6|5.0|I love Tracey Thorn's voice, and she doesn't disappoint on this album. Very original and beautifully sung, for Everything But The Girl fans, this is your Christmas CD.
B0002E5O9G|5.0|Worth purchasing to own a great Anniversary Concert rendition of Les Miseables. A collector should not be without this recording.
B0077EBWVI|4.0|Big fan of the old Footloose.  New one is surprisingly good!  Acting is quality.  The storyline is similar, but not an exact replica.  If you liked the old one, watch the new one.
B004SBS8LA|4.0|This version of Angry Birds is a great variation from the original. A lot of fun for anyone! Get it now!
B000X5SPBI|4.0|This series is one of the few that I enjoy that my roommate likes...love the classic rock oldies in this series.
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|Fun game to play on my new Kindle Fire! Would recommend it to all who enjoy great fun game play!
B00B2V66VS|3.0|I liked the first version better. I don't like every time I die is not because I can't keep up, but that the game doesn't work well with touchscreen. I've played this game on a friends device as well; same results.
030758836X|5.0|Nick and Amy Dunne are two characters I'm not likely to forget anytime soon.  Masterfully crafted with the slow, steady build-up of tension, suspense, hints and clues, all the while fleshing out the main characters in such a way to bring them fully to life.  The final outcome was outstanding.
B004SD5GZ4|5.0|The Adobe Reader makes it so I can take my knitting and crochet patterns with me no matter where I go.
B009GXHOW4|5.0|My child recommends PoketinEditor as an add on for Minecraft, because you can get any tool you want at any time.
B0051ANPZQ|4.0|I liked how the book went through different kids perspective and by the of the book that most all of the characters had changed to be more compassionate people.  I think a lot of kids who read the book will relate to how Augie felt that many people have felt similar but to a less degree.  I recommend and not to just that age group.
B003LSTK8G|4.0|I think the US as whole should go belly up. A detailed account of greed. Even the good guys are bad here.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I originally started watching through a prompting of a friend. After the first 2 episodes of S1 I was hooked. Very compelling story of a time gone by, a family that although with position and money still has to deal with day to day, heartache, deceit, drama and just life in general which doesn't make them all that different in so many ways than the people who serve them.
B002KVZBGA|1.0|The recent remake of the Italian job was far more professional.. It goes to show how far movies have come since then<br /><br />This was painful at times to watch
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This is the first book I've read by this author, and really, really enjoyed it - read the whole thing in one day! The characters are so real and the story so engaging that you won't be able to put it down. This is more of a young adult book, which I don't typically read, but the themes the author uses and the emotions she brings out in the reader are universal. Highly recommend this book!
B003YL4LYI|5.0|I enjoyed the book immensely, and am looking forward to the next installment.... a must read for those who have read the ones before
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I've always loved horses but I don't have room for one around here.  This game is so much fun to play with the horses. Thanks for the neat game!!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Omg this game is so cool! I'm very happy right now that this is free! if it was any money I couldn't get it!
B003JTHXOK|4.0|Loved the suspense! I've always been a fan of Nicholas Sparks....he never ceases to disappoint!  Some parts were predictable, but when you have read so many of his books, that happens. Ready for the movie to come out this month!
B005CRQ3RK|5.0|Believe it or not I'd like to try to get a new film coming  consumers can never have a five star like
B00AREIAI8|5.0|It is a lot of Fun for my daughter who loves animals. I also get pretty into the game sometimes. Cute.
B004ZQBOK0|4.0|I bought this CD for my daughter because she loves the band so much.  I ended up liking their music myself.
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|I couldn't put down the book, it's so full of thrills and magic! I recommend this to everyone! Anyone who loved Harry Potter books, should read this series!
B0002NRQTI|5.0|This is one of the best Rush CDs that they have ever put out.  Every single song is great.  Fantastic.
B001UTW7QU|5.0|Great characters. Great Story. You want to know what happens to them. It's a wonderfully addictive story arc that keeps you wanting more.
B005974CNA|4.0|I bought this CD after seeing a video of one of the songs on this CD.  I was impressed at the quality of the musicians.
B008476HBM|5.0|I've wanted to read this book since I saw the movie. It's such a charming book. I adore dear Lizzie and her character.
B003U53GK8|2.0|The final season of 'LOST' was a weakly written and character centered wrap up of a great story that tried and failed to tie 5 seasons together. The story moved from being plot centered and left many seemingly important questions unanswered or even addressed. My wife and I were very disappointed with the entire last season and I still wonder about many plot twists that were ignored by the writers. In retrospect, it would have been better to stop watching after the conclusion of season 5.<br />Totally disgusted.
B007ZD17XO|5.0|lots of fun. been trying different games that weren't too exciting but this one is great and addicting and fast paced
B00008F2LT|2.0|There's not a bad song here, but seven of them are also on Chronicle: The 20 Greatest Hits. That leaves four, which other reviewers have described. If you're a big fan, you're going to have all seven studio albums, certainly including this one. For me, since I have Chronicle, I'm going to simplify my life and not keep Cosmo's Factory. (Note - I am very picky in my record evaluations, and give a thumbs up--four or five stars--only to albums where I can play the whole record and delight in hearing every single song.)
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Fabulous show!!  I'm hooked!  I had been told by my son and daughter-in-law that I needed to watch this series.  After one show I was hooked!
B007FEFLTO|4.0|Ken Follett does it again: brings life, politics, war and intrigue into a full-blown historic novel that, if you're like me and haven't the chronology etched firmly in your minds, helps understand a good dash of world history through a story of believable - and heroic - characters.

B005PK56TA|4.0|watched 4 in a row, writing and acting are excellent. There seems to be potential for more episodes but i see season 2 has a new theme/location.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|A family that has conflict, respect and love that is ridget , painful and misunderstood. I would love yo live like that for a week!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this game and I love taking care of my horse ... must get it it is not a waste of space
B00ATPVA78|5.0|The graphics are detailed, beautiful, and haunting. I had to use hints quite a bit, but most of the time if you just look around and click on everything, you can figure out what to do. Haven't needed a walkthrough so far.

B0094BB4TW|5.0|What can I say?  After purchasing my kindle fire hd the first thing I did was download the facebook app and log in to see how many &#34;likes&#34; I'd had on my latest status.  Every like is a squirt of Dopamine and Facebook is my dealer.  It fills up the screen and had a draggable side bar with everything in it.<br /><br />Flawless interface and just one more way I can get my next fix.<br /><br />Like.  Squirt.
B007SGM084|3.0|Not really into this type of book but after reading all of them, did enjoy the complete story line<br />Well written
B009O2XY12|1.0|I don't like being lied to.  Misled.  Deceived.  Lead astray.  etc.<br /><br />So when I download an app that claims to be free, I expect it to be free.  Not a ridiculous assumption given that the app says it's free.<br /><br />It's free to download. Okay.<br />It's even free to play... for a while.<br /><br />You see, you end up running out of Bubbles unless you are a master bubble lobber like me(actually I suck) and then you have to pay, yes PAY to get more bubbles.<br /><br />Bubble Mania, you have broken my heart. Popped my trust bubble and then asked me for more.<br /><br />I am afraid you and I have to go our separate ways.  It's not you... Wait.  Yeah it totally is you.
B00000DHZJ|5.0|The songs I was interested in are all here, I didn't need Hendrix whole library and was not a fan of all of it anyway, but this greatest hits package has all the great songs I know and love except for Star Spangled Banner which is skippable.  Great disc for the price.
B006GECE9Y|5.0|Dolphin Browser is lightning fast.  It out paces Amazon Silk very noticeably.  It out performs it in every way.  My only problem is that there are a ton of addons for it that include flash, youtube and so much more but the Kindle allows you to download Dolphin but none of it's addons.  Even if you change your settings to allow third party apps.  The only way around this is to sideload your kindle or root it.  Neither of which I am comfortably educated on.<br /><br />Pros: Kick butt browser, create your own gestures, use voice commands and more.<br />Cons:  If your using this on a Kindle then you'll never experience the full potentiality of the browser.
B007MB5OCE|5.0|Very interesting and a comical account of historical events<br /><br />I would definitely recommend reading this book.  Share with your friends!
B004SBQAN8|4.0|Not bad for a futuristic. Who knows wierd things happen every day on this planet. But I don't know about aliens.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|Chris Kyle, was an American Patriot Who made numerous sacrifices for his Country. There's know telling how many lives were saved from his action as being the Sniper he was. GREAT BOOK. To bad this man met his fate from a coward.
B005LAII0I|5.0|I really enjoy this movies it was so funny. Julia Roberts is so versital and manages to be intertaining no matter what her role.
B00030EIXW|5.0|The Concertgebouw Orchestra is at its best with Kleiber.  The tempi are aggressive yet supple with nuanced phrasing resulting in a tour de force for all the musicians.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|This is such aGreat show.. Great season! I will miss it when it is over,Can't wait for season 4 now.
B0040I09RM|5.0|SoA is a great series. Its been a favorite of mine since the beginning, Im not introducing it to my boyfriend and watching the seasons over again is just as much fun as the first time around!
B007YA5NRO|5.0|This is an excellent book and I would not be able to use this camera without it. I purchased the Kindle edition, and the only downside is that there are no page numbers when using that edition with the PC App.  Interestingly, I have also installed this on my iPod Touch, and this does supply page numbers as well as the live links in the Table of Contents.<br /><br />When I first got my camera, Alexander White had not yet published the version for the x10, so I bought the one for the x100 which helped enormously with getting the camera up and running.  I also wrote to the author begging him to put out an x10 version, and I am so glad that he did.<br /><br />Since I have not read the book from cover to cover, I must thank the reviewer who mentioned the need to upgrade the firmware.  I will try doing that, and, of course, I will use this book to find out how.
B00AEJM6H2|4.0|It is a fun game I like to play. But it will keep on stopping in the middle of the game.
B007R12TNQ|5.0|Great when you have a house full of kids and you just want to settle them down and relax for a while
B009IEXKXI|4.0|If you like adventure stories (and sausage) with details how it was made, you will like this book. The tale weaves a fair bit of plausible science (at a not too far distant future where the leap of faith in the described space gizmos is possible) into an exciting race against destruction. It pits unrelenting alien environmental elements against problem solving and personal discipline. It is sort of a Robinson Crusoe story of resourcefulness and unanticipated pitfalls that while you know he probably will make it out, you can’t see the solution of how he will do it – and this is what makes it fun.
B008ASLK8A|3.0|You really need to like to be in suspence. the movie is slow going so you will need to be patient.
B0095P31L6|5.0|It is a great movie for the whole family. I would highly recommend it to anyone whether the have children or not.
B007JRU2UK|3.0|George clooney definatly carries this movie.  Overall its a good movie to fill some time if your looking for a Drama
B0034G4P4O|5.0|I love this film.  I know that the Uncanny valley is a somewhat off-putting for many people, but the level of detail in this film is dazzling.  The characters are believable and the cinematography that Spielberg put into it was FABULOUS!  Loved it!
B000HT3PPG|5.0|When you think Christmas Movie their are a select few that have lasted the test of time.  This is defantly one of them.  But do see the color version. It does add a little something more.
B003XT8Y3K|5.0|Kaufmann is the tenor we have been waiting for since the retirement of Guiseppe di Stefano. He has the same passion in his voice.

B007C9N4H8|4.0|This movie is just a fun time movie about bringing back the muppet.  If you like the muppets then you should like this movie.
B0063IH60K|5.0|My hubby loaded my new kindle with this and I play it every night before I go to sleep. You should try it.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This book is a great read! Made me want to read Book 2 and 3. So I bought those as well.
B004LROMX4|5.0|When I discovered this series, it was the middle of the second season, so I ordered the first season before watching the second season.  It is so very good and my skeptical son, who borrowed it to watch, has also enjoyed it.  Can't wait for the next season!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I couldn't put the series down. I had to read from beginning to end. It's a wonderful love story. I enjoyed it.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|My grown son's told me about this new series.  They had read the comic books and knew it was something I might enjoy.  It has become my favorite show.  It is broadcast on a channel I don't receive, so I buy each episode the day after it runs, without all the long commercials!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|It was a great story! I loved it from beginning to end.  I haven't read a romance novel in such a long time and this one made me think about reading more of them.
B0049VZ222|5.0|My son's told me about this series but I don't receive the television channel that run's it.  So, each week I buy the episode, and don't have to endure the long commercials.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|This book is well written and the author alternates between both of the heroines so you are kept informed of every thing that is happening. It is fast moving and hard to put down. There are many discussion points and highly recommended for all book clubs out there who enjoy reading historic fiction.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|A nice way to challenge your brain in a relaxing way. Interesting to play. I like the higher more challenging levels best.
B00B5HQLMI|5.0|Best James Bond ever! I really enjoyed this action packed film. Daniel Craig protrayed James Bond to a tee.  Stunts, special effects and  schematics were excellent.
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|Very interesting story of the war with the twist of humanity that exposes the character of German people who in order to do their duty to Germany found themselves in a position in time not supporting the powers and goals of the Reich yet serving to the end with honor.
B0083P1QUM|5.0|Patricia Cornwell is probably the only author I will buy hot off the press, however, her previous two books had sort of gotten away from reality a bit.  All Kay needed was a cape!  The Bone Bed returns to the Kay we love and to a grounded story line.  I always enjoy Cornwell's novels because the amount of research she puts into them are obvious.  Even though a book is fiction, I want to learn something from it, and I never fail to do so with hers.
B0068THAGY|5.0|When Spielberg knocks it out of the park he really gets a home run! Good movie if you are going through a tough time.
B004FGMDOQ|3.0|A good fantasy storyline.  I enjoyed reading the book but it isn't a book I would go back and read again at some point.
B004LOJPLQ|5.0|A must see if you care to be inspired. I love boxing and makin' comebacks and this movie has both.<br />It's great to see others overcome adversity to be reminded that we can all overcome adversity in our<br />own time.
B000IDGDPA|4.0|I thought of the headline while watching this movie. An unexpected turnaround of events really makes you wonder, is perception everything?
B008602KQI|4.0|A fantastic fantasy story. :-) I know this movie was made for little girls mostly but it grabbed me with the art direction<br />and the interesting story. It's been a while since I've seen a dramatic sci-fi fantasy film that hit a homer.
B003VW54QO|5.0|This is one of the best movies I ever saw. This team of actors really nailed their parts including Walter Brennan singing!
B000H4TX9I|5.0|This show should be a staple for any sci-fi fan. I would like to have seen the story develop through a few seasons, but alas they only got one run. If you want to see where the story arc was headed, then pick up the movie \\"Serenity.\\"
B005EGXTL2|1.0|Dumb and stupid, even for a younger person's novel.  The story has by book three, lost its edge, ideas and drive.  I only finished it because it was really so bad that it was funny.
B005VPRFSY|5.0|Recipient of gift loved it!  He is really into Star Wars and Legos so this was a perfect for him
B005EGXTHG|3.0|The story is okay but a distinct drop off from the first.  The plot that Kat is a symbol and an 'cassus belli' of revolution is just silly.
B004PAHZMC|5.0|Recipient of gift loved it!  He is really into Star Wars and Lego's so this was a great addition to his collection and it stored them too!
B009UX2YAC|2.0|don't get mad or anything but I just don't see what's so fun about this game. I mean its ok but amazing.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I love Nicholas Sparks and this turned out to be one of my favorites. I couldn't put it down. I'm sure there are mixed reviews about the ending, but I loved it. I can't wait to see the movie.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This game has a lot more to it<br />There is like a big monkey chasing you but in the other one there is three
B0042TV4IW|5.0|Loved all the different storylines, couldn't wait to see how they were resolved. Sorry when Larkrise to Candleford was over..
B003U4UPHG|5.0|I chose this rating because the series is captivating and I can't wait to watch the next episode. Watching it on my Kindle Fire HD makes me feel like I am there on the Island..More personal..
B0063M22QO|4.0|I like the tiles and it plays quickly. Sometimes I am confused by how to move to the next level although I seem to be moving along at present.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|Worked just as it said it would. Not much to describe about a cable. Either it works or it doesn&#34;t. This one worked perfectly.
B007XAYKX8|4.0|It might be the slowest of the three documentarys, but it still gets the heart and adrenalin pumping! Absolutely Worth seeing.
B0058O84G0|5.0|Perfect stories, thruth and fiction. Just great, as we are used to from Ken Follet. Many stories mingled in and great to read about WW 1 in so many settings with a beautiful clue. Can't wait to download # 3
B005K17RU0|5.0|Finally a weather/travel app that provides exactly the right amount of info quickly and concisely.  AAA rating!  Thanks so much!
B0071BGOJC|4.0|After having read Fall of Giants, I just could wait to get hold on his 2nd book in this triology. Again a number of red threads , in this case family's, who experience Europe before and during the 2nd WW. Perfect fiction in combination with the truth. I love it.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|At first I found it hard to understand the accent of some of the cast and soon was able to figure out enough of what was being said to follow. Thanks goodness there is some good with the evil of the cast that can balance out all of the intertwined mess of this family and staff.
B008N1V11U|5.0|great graphics and fun game but does take a lot of memory. I had to delete a bunch of apps just to play this game but it was worth it.
B000FCJZ3G|5.0|This book has definitely already made a difference in my life--it is a life changer and really woke me up.  It very clearly outlines actual steps for breaking through the mental, emotional and intellectual boundaries we put our &#34;money minds&#34; in!
B0081SPK0I|5.0|brings back memories. cool game and fun. i love the fact that i got it for free also, but is is worth it if you have to buy it.
B001V7YWTQ|5.0|Great album was there to see and hear Both Eric And Steve were Great the album is Great. Greatest inperson
B008CPZNL6|3.0|i dont know if it was just me but this app keeps logging me out of the facebook app. Cool app though.
B00B7G3Y4U|1.0|Worst one ever. For a scary movie, it did not make us jump at all. Overall there was not a very good plot line. Had to force myself to stay interested in it.
B004EFYZ1C|4.0|my son really loves the moon and looks at this app every night. I do wish it did a little more.
B0038KM8MW|5.0|What can you say. Everything I've seen that Kevin Costner did was good. Enjoyed the movie. The quality was excellent.
B000N2HBSO|4.0|In this book Lincoln was depicted in his relationships with 3-4 key advisories who later  became members of his cabinet. It gave a lot of depth to his character and the times of Lincoln.  It was very well researched.  At  times, however,  it was a bit confusing to an individual who was not familiar with the finer details of Lincoln's life.
B006LSZECO|3.0|After all the hype, I thought it would be really good. I was disappointed... It wasn't deep enough, I guess, but I can't pinpoint why.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|there were no dull moments in this book, it was an amazing love story!!  Nicholas Sparks is my favorite author, and as always, this book was hard to put down.  He never fails me, can't wait until the next novel!
B003O86FMW|5.0|I could not stop reading it. I am now reading the third in the series and the story is gripping.
B0081336FO|4.0|We like the fact that this Sherlock is living in todays world. Also has very good actors. We think that peeople of all ages would enjoy this series.
034580404X|4.0|Fantasy reading makes it worth the purchase. This is not true to life but as all fictional books go this is great reading.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|Just finished Chris' book, \\"American Sniper.\\"<br /><br />Excellent and well told story that truly reveals the humble nature of a silent professional. This isn't a book about a bad ass showing off. It's a book about a man loyal to his God, his country, and his family. Chris' personality and sense of humor shine through on every page.<br /><br />The reason I chose to read his book now is that on the day Chris was killed I was at Barnes & Noble and saw his books out on a display table. I thought, \\"That looks interesting. I should read it. Some day.\\" That same evening I read the news about Chris' death. In no time at all I had his book purchased and downloaded to my Kindle. The Kindle has gone everywhere with me this past week, and every spare minute has been spent reading.<br /><br />Only one warning: Either the paper or the ink, or perhaps both, appear to be toxic. Every so often I get a sudden, unexplained allergic reaction.<br /><br />Rest in peace, Chris. By now I'm sure God has called you into that back room, and what He really said was, \\"Well done, good and faithful servant.\\"
B006X96PF6|5.0|again, we buy all her tapes due to the fact that we are big fans of hers and see her in concert when she comes to tx.
B0042U94UQ|5.0|Fun for the whole family.  My husband and I laughed as much as the kids.  A lot going on so no boring parts.
B003VXMMTK|4.0|I had not read the book on which the film was based, so I was surprised by the film plot.  It was a true tragedy, but good love story.  The acting was excellent.
B0024Y9EYS|5.0|It's a pretty good season since is total different but I guess it makes sences about the<br />Terminator movies ..:)
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|Exciting thriller that has more action than an NBA game and keeps gaining momentum throughout the entire story. Hard to put down once you start reading it.
B00B49L7JY|5.0|Stop what you're doing. Right now.  Gather your friends and family.  Watch this. Then watch it again.  And buy the music.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|The characters are so complex, flawed yet usually likeable. A real treat, and the historical accuracy is spot on.Enjoy this treasure.
B001UTW7QU|5.0|Season 1 of Fringe is a must see.  The character building and layering of information is never boring, always building with each consecutive episode. My daughter could never get into Fringe because she tried to pick it up mid-season 2 and it really just not possible. These writers are amazing and the storyline goes places that make perfect sense - when all are watched. There are deep questions about life that are touched on, relationships and yet it has action and best of all, humor.  This is a series well worth your time.
B008YRVW0I|3.0|It's a good game but I don't like how you have to buy the full game for 4 dollars cause I don't have any money to use and I think it's a little pricey
B00B2V66VS|5.0|best game ever you get 100000% everyone you need to play this game have fun playing this game kalee frewerd
B00B2V66VS|2.0|This app is horrible because when I go on it the coins go Down back to zero it annoys me so much  like when I got up to 4,987 it goes back down to zero!!!! They really need to fix this. If they don't I will delete this app right away. I do NOT recommend this app for people who have kindle fires.
B0094K1MH2|5.0|The detail, story, drama and adventure will keep you stuck to your tv! I wish there were more movies inspider by the many titinadventures
B009UX2YAC|3.0|It's a fun game but I don't like how  some of the characters are limited and very many coins!!?? So I also like that the background s change for example it changes from NY to Rio
B0070Y46UY|5.0|Too few adjectives exist in the English language ( or any other !) to fully describe the wonders of this amazing story.  Well written and visually descriptive to totally entrace the reader into the feeling of being in every scene with Pi.  I later saw the film and thought that it portrayed the story very well but I was very glad that I had read the book so that I could fill in all the wonderful detail that couldn't possibly have fitted into a 2 hour movie.<br />Wheterh you read the book before or after the movie you will still find it a brilliant read.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I gave this book a rating of 5 stars because the book was absolutely superb! However, the ending was a bit shocking. And the whole book was just beautifully written the whole way through! I would recommend this book to anyone and everyone. It has a little bit of something for everyone.
B009X2CVXA|4.0|The writer takes you on a Journey of discovery of the many human strengths and frailties that beset us all and very cleverly weaves an intriguing story around the personalities.  A good read and an easy read.
B00A9X9TIW|3.0|It was not as good as I thought it might be, but okay. Think it was a little slow getting started
B008YU0AOE|5.0|love it!  Its easy to use.  Just like the calculator on my I phone.  I would recommend this to anyone!
B00APUQH0W|4.0|Not Clints best work but I would watch anything he stars in. Hope his next movie is better. Awesome actor
B00340LM8C|3.0|I love Hitchcock and I think Cary Grant is great.  I also think this movie was rather slow.  They could have either added more to the plot or cut the movie in half.  I found myself watching the clock.  If your're new to Hitchcock, you might want to pick something else first, like Psycho.
B003SI3URQ|5.0|This was one of the few Disney films that slipped through the cracks of my childhood; I hadn't seen it until my senior year of college. Then, I rented it here on Amazon.com and loved it so much that I watched it three times in a row. Fabulous Disney film with glorious art, some of the best music of all Disney time, and enough imagination to keep a twenty-year-old student easily hooked...three run-throughs in a row.
B007ZTLLMK|4.0|I do not use this , but my husbandhas it and he plays it a lot, he really likes it,
B001ANYDAO|5.0|I loved every aspect of this book. Great reasearch. Stories well told. i recommend this to every one, A fun read
B008B92U32|2.0|just don't think I will use this that much once I looked at it, just because it is free does not make it usefull
B001UTW7QU|3.0|When I find a good series, I tend to watch the all the episodes whenever I have time.  For this show, I find myself watching it only if I can't find anything else to watch.  It is entertaining, but not compelling.
B00AMBLXP8|5.0|Surprised by Mark Wahlbergs performance. Was really funny but a bit grizzly at times. Not for your holier than though church goer
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I love this show--the acting, the characters, the story lines, the setting, the fashions--everything!  Of course, my favorite character has to be the Dowager Countess played by Maggie Smith--her one liners are spot on.  If you're one of the few who hasn't been watching this series, start now!  It's fantastic.
0486414124|5.0|My wife is one of Ms. Jane Austen's greatest admirers. She has a collection of every story that Austen wrote and has been published. She knows them by heart by never tires of them. Great little books at a great price.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is a great game for people who love horses but don't have the money or space to keep one.<br />This game is also a great game for kids. Both my boys love taking care of their horses.
0486296342|5.0|My wife loves books such as this.  She can never have to many or read them to much. She is a total romantic.
0765325950|5.0|Great way to end the series.  Held my attention from beginning to end.  I am sad to see this series end
B005K17RU0|5.0|Best weather app out there. There are more options than available with other weather apps. I use it often daily.
B005COO1X6|2.0|It was an interesting story line that ended too quickly and abruptly. Nothing was explained and it left me hanging.
B0049J3QF4|5.0|My son is in love with this movie. It never gets old and we really enjoy it as a family!
B001F6ZIXW|5.0|Fascinating to watch the culture of this fringe segment of our society.  Well written and good acting.  Not appropriate for teens or younger.
B002NZTZ8S|5.0|My son loves trains and watched this over and over. It's a great film and I would highly recommend it!
B00B2G2RG6|5.0|Missed the pilot so had to go back and watch the beginning!  A great show - look forward to future epidsodes!!
B006MW3UZW|5.0|My husband and I have watched all the episodes together with a promise we won't log on without the other.  It is a giant soap opera but more importantly it is a lesson in history showing how the culture was changing after WWI.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|Like I sais before these are my kind of stories, I'm only hoping for a Season 4 of Downton Abby, hate the thought of waiting a year.  These stories are very well done.<br />We bought a Zoo, wa bought for my grand kids, I liked it and so do they..
0307352153|5.0|A must read for anyone who thinks they wish they were more out going or wish their childeren were also.
B007QXU0ZO|5.0|I purchased this cd for my son and he says that he loves it. It's not my kind of music so I can't really say much other than it was delivered very fast and in excellent condition.
B0076DELIG|4.0|The Bosch character is so well established it can always be relied on to provide an entertaining read. In this story, Bosch is working a very old open case of murder so there is a lot of repetition of the facts of the first investigation. Not the best Bosch but still a good read<br />Dave
B007UQ5Z1G|5.0|This is a great cd. I know music is a personal taste so if you're already a Linkin Park fan you know you have to have this. They have a very unique sound, and you can't say that about too many bands. I would categorize it as alternative rock, and it rocks.
B0076DCT2G|5.0|A facinating story of espionage, terrorism, and culture in Yemen.  This novel leaves the reader with some suspicions of the CIA.
B007OWG3LM|5.0|I purchased this cd for my son and he says that he loves it. It's not my kind of music so I can't really say much other than it was delivered very fast and in excellent condition.
B0010SKUYM|2.0|I can't believe I read this entire, lengthy book, and at the end none of the issues pending in the story were resolved.  In my case, if Mr. Rothfuss was trying to entice us into reading his Kingkiller Chronicle sequels, it didn't work!
B006MW3V6U|5.0|This is beautifully filmed with engaging storylines. I'd recommend it to anyone who like the film &#34;Gosford Park&#34; or the series &#34;Upstairs, Downstairs.&#34;
B00AIQP9DE|1.0|i paid 4.99 to open the full version. I then went through part of the game and saved it. when i went back into it, the game loads and then knocks me out and i go back to my kindle carousel. i then tried again with a new user name and started from the beginning and got to the point where i have to hook up the car to the winch, it tells me i have all the parts and the hint button says to connect the rope to the car but the rope will not attached to the wood block under the car. so now I am stuck again!!!  I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS GAME, THEY NEED TO WORK OUT THE BUGS, I GOT RIPPED AND CANNOT FINISH THE GAME ON MY KINDLE
B003L77G6A|5.0|this show is so so so so so hilarious. please watch it! this is one show i believe is consistently funny throughout its series.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I read this book in two days. I was hooked. I went out the next day and bought both Catching Fire and Mockingjay because I knew I would finish them just as fast.
B008476HBM|4.0|I have watched the movie many times, so I wanted to see what the book was like. I really enjoyed it. I am glad my Kindle has a dictionary so I could really appreciate the story.
B009HQ9UHC|2.0|Angry Birds Rio<br />I found this challenge very entertaining. I liked it. It is addictive. I love getting three stars every time!
B003TSEEDY|5.0|One of the best books ever written. You won't regret reading this! I think everyone can relate to each of the characters in a different way the movie wasnt half bad either
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I cannot find the words to express how much this book and the previous two touched me.  Collins built a world who had found near distinction seventy-five years before, yet once again faces a war that could be the distinction of the human race, at least in North America.  And to tell the story through the eyes of the most hopeful of humans, children, was masterful.  Katniss Everdeen will live long in the annals of literature and in my heart.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game is awesome because you get to build anything ever since any century<br />even 1999  you can even the country's flag
B00AREIAI8|3.0|not good directions, can buy horses when you want more horses. I just think the directions could be a litte better explained.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I loved this book it was well written and went places i didnt expect especially towards the end. It was sensitively handled and i would read it again
0439023491|5.0|I bought this as a present for my teenage sister - she likes reading, and enjoys a good story. Great buy - this cost way less than what you would spend on the same book at a book store, like Barnes and Noble. Great price for being hard cover.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|graet for people on the go lets you keep up with your bible study on the go.it is easy to use and fun to use.
B0036TGT3E|5.0|It's the Lion King, so of course it's awesome!...And having the DVD and blu-ray discs to pick from, in the same package, it's even better! The colors and sharpness of the animation in the blu-ray is remarkable and you can definitely tell the difference in quality from the DVD. If you're a big Disney fan, you need to watch this in blu-ray.
B0063GORYU|5.0|i choose this game because of the chalenging look of the game.It makes you think about what you are doing. works the mind
0307341577|5.0|This is my favorite book if hers by far. Really good dark and intriguing. You can really feel what her characters are feeling. Great story.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|i like this game lets me think about something other then stearess. thank you.play it a lot on weekends fun
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is so awesome as long as you're good at it you'll love this game too it's awesome get it.
B00APUYWYA|5.0|I absolutely loved this movie. If you loved Bridemaids you'll love this, the actors were phenomenal.  The music arrangement and harmonies is what I admired the most about this film.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Dis . Game is really addictive I love it u can never get bored . Great game. Get it! Great for lil children to play
B00AMBH70S|1.0|I loved the movie and could not even finish it...The quality was horrible.  I already sent a email to amazon to hopefully get refunded or get another 48 hours to view.  I would like to finish this movie.  It kept stopping in the middle and I would have to start from the beginning.
B00280LYHS|5.0|It was an AMAZING ending to the Percy Jackson series. I happy I finished but sad that there are no more :-)
B0071XO8RA|4.0|Suspenseful, imaginative and twists and turns around each curve of the staircase!  I can't wait to read the next omnibus!
B00AESN8XY|5.0|Plague Inc. Has grafted strategy with real world diseases.  Not only will this game captivate you, it will educate you.  Never again will you neglect an organisms ability to thrash that which seems superior to it(US!).  5 Stars and a great buy!
B004LROUNG|5.0|This book was humorous, intelligent and witty. The flawed characters were likeable and human and understandable. Very entertaining book. One of John Grisham's best work since the rainmaker.
B000WTXEAM|5.0|Best album ever...George Harrison is a genius when righting lyrics about Krishna conciousness he is a genuine poet and is definitely my favorite Beatle...Hare Krishna!!!
B0058YPG2K|5.0|I am waiting for series 5 . Great Movie plot .I loved the action and constant excitement with all the trials and overcoming all the obstacles
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|Epic book this is amazing keep up the good work and plz make some more books I will love them :)
B009UX2YAC|2.0|The game is great for kids, but the holiday versions could use some work. One day my cousin came up to me and said \\"Sam, I dont want Christmas to come. \\" Why not? He says, \\" I don't want Santa to come and chase me.\\" I took a look at the game and I saw Santa chasing a kid!!! Who does that? What's next? The Easter Bunny?
B00AFCEIB0|4.0|I have never had any trouble using Google search. Seems to be quick which is important..get my ? Answered ok
B00AREIAI8|5.0|my 5 year old loves horses but wii games are too hard. she loves this game and its easy tor her to play. only wish I didn't have to have wifi for it
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Such a good book! I cannot wait to go see the movie when it comes out! Definitely a must read.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|This is a fun game if you really love horses.  It is pretty realistic and I like all the chores you have to do to keep your horse going.  In my own opinion, the way the horse moves looks weird sometimes.  The legs look a bit deformed and the horse travels with its head held really high.  But it is an app and it is difficult to duplicate a horse for something like this.  Otherwise neat game.
B004WGIXX4|5.0|Nathalie portman's work, as always meaningful. Let you think about it while relaxing and laughing. Even a low cost film can be productive.
B009UX2YAC|1.0|Help! My daughter pressed a Rio special/hover board? It erased all her points! She is devastated!! Any idea what happened? Is that her fault?
B009FZHYKU|5.0|It's the best show, I love it. I definitely would recommend it to anyone. Lots of cliff hanger endings though.
B00B5HQLMI|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie. I didn't think that I would from the previews, but this by far exceeded my expectations. I saw it in theaters when it first came out (which I don't do often), and I now own an HD copy of it (which I NEVER do). I watched it right after purchase and plan to watch it several more times this week. Great movie!
B003M70O5O|4.0|Lots of emoting, lots of blazing guns, heroes who are villains, and vice versa. The last five minutes of every episode is a doozie of a plot twist to keep you coming back for more.
B004TU05Y8|5.0|Fully satisifed with this purchase. Exceeded expectations and well worth the price. I would definately recommend this product to others.
B003LQ3YXU|5.0|I wasn't sure I'd like the new twist on Dr Who, so I went in to the season without high hopes.  I was wrong.  It caught me from the very first episode.  I was immediately invested in the Doctor and Rose.
B008UFUOH6|4.0|I was fairly satisifed with this purchase. Met expectations and worth the price. I would probably recommend this product to others.
B00A1XOPE8|3.0|I was very disappointed when I ordered and finished this book in the same night. This was the book that taught me to check the length of a kindle book before ordering!
B003QS9WIE|4.0|It was good. Saw the movie when it first came out. Appreciate a movie that makes you think unlike so many other movies these days.
B0033AGPF8|5.0|You cant go wrong with Jimi plus this album has some of his greatest most meaningful songs, the lp cover was beautiful as well as the vinyl pressing and sound
0525952616|5.0|I really enjoyed Daemon and Freedom(tm), so when Kill Decision came out I read it immediately.  The Utopian society that the Daemon created with the help of humans is the opposite of what transpires in this story - that initially disappointed me but I realized I was disappointed because it seems like a more realistic view on how the world could progress.<br /><br />My only real critique of the book might be the first few chapters.  Here's a hint, don't get too 'attached' to one of the groups introduced.  I felt a bit annoyed, but it definitely kept me wondering what was going to happen next.  (Though it did close up a few loose ends rather well.)  Thankfully this was a limited use of this plot device and the remainder of the story had sufficient character development.<br /><br />Looking forward to the next books by Mr. Suarez.<br /><br />Update 2013-03-09<br /> * I re-read the book and my review and moved up to a full 5 stars.  My removal of a single star for the plot device early on was not fair and would have made the story overly complex.  Given the current discussions regarding armed drones and their use world wide, this book is more timely than ever.
B0033AGPFS|5.0|Jimi and the experience at their greatest awesome songs,awesome double lps and pressing and the music is timeless a must buy for Hendrix and vinyl fans!
B005PK56TA|5.0|I must say, some of the scenes are quite shocking and graphic, and, as in all good horror stories, the players seem to do exactly what they shouldn't--like staying in the house! With all its twists and surprises, the story will hook you and Jessica Lange as the disturbing neighbor is such a wonderful bonus! Her presence and acting add even more luster to this gem!
B00821OX98|5.0|Very thought provoking, suspenseful, and adventurous! With endearing characters. The writers accomplish the task of balancing action with drama so that it appeals to a variety of  audiences.
B009D5VNLS|5.0|This is a must see! Great message delivered in a wonderful story that everyone will like. No need for a Prince Charming rescue, the heroin of this story gets the job done!
B00499NHLC|4.0|This is a smart and funny series. Nicwe to see lots of thinking and few guns or other exploding items.
B009CF7JDU|5.0|Everybody has those few movies that when you see them playing you have to stop and watch. Well Ferris Beuller's Day Off is one of mine. I can watch this movie over and over again. Each and everytime I watch the movie I find something else that I laugh out loud again. I've watch the directors cut and the 25 anniversary special of FBDO and have a new appreciation for the work that John Hughes did behind the scenes. Great movie, time to go watch again!!!
B007PT3QOQ|3.0|really fun but I wish there was a better way to get energy than having to wait 3 minutes.  addictive game though.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|IT WORKS JUST FINE , HAD A PROBLEM WITH THE KINDLE.THE CONNECTOR IN THE KINDLE WENT BAD. THE CORD WORKS PERFECTLY.
B000WCDBKM|5.0|Johnny Depp come into his own in this film directed by the great Roman Polanski. A supernaturla thriller that leads Depp on a chase through Europe. Excellent cinematography, smart script and excellent acting by Depp and Frank Lengella make this mystery and exciting adventure!
B0095P3ULC|3.0|Of course it has great effects but overall it's fairly tired. More of the same just not as good .
B000002KXV|5.0|Now on CD, it's a must for audiophiles. Donald Fagen takes you on a trip from the past and into the future in the first installment of his Travel Trilogy.
0446572993|4.0|Of course one can't help to have heard of David Baldacci's name if they spend anytime perusing the New York Times or Amazon's Best Sellers list.  And while I've heard of him, I'll honestly admit that I've never read him - until now.  And before I go on with the review, keep in mind that one of my all-time favorite novels involves a clown in a sewer grate saying we all float down here.  So exact factual references are not an absolute necessity for me to enjoy a work of fiction. That being said...<br /><br />From the beginning, \\"The Innocent\\" grabbed and held my attention as the author worked strands of subplots and scenarios into an action packed tale of intrigue.  The protagonist, a man who kills people for a living, is redeemed when he refuses one particular hit. That refusal has him on the run and has him directly in contact of young Julie, a runaway who witnessed her parents murder.<br /><br />I liked \\"The Innocent\\" because it did grab my attention and had me turning the page to see what happened next.  That Baldacci created a protagonist with flaws and some sense of \\"morality\\" and questioning both, had me pulling for Will Robie through the story. I liked the way that the author created a story around the sleeper cell theories and moles within the government. For a thriller, the action was steady, not overwhelming.<br /><br />Of course there were flaws in this, as well.  The breadcrumbs were a little too obvious and the surprise was a little flat. A weapons expert could probably pick some of the details apart and some of the scenarios and sequences were overtly elaborate for the motive.  Still, given that this was a piece of fiction and not a CIA handbook on how to recover from a botched hit, the flaws weren't enough to distract me from enjoying my first read of David Baldacci.
0739326651|5.0|Iformative read about Barack Obama and what his thought's are on the state of the nation and the direction we're heading.
B003LQ3YXU|5.0|Compelling, funny and exciting.  I only wish that the season one Doctor Who would have been in the future seasons.  Their is excellent chemistry among the cast.
B009E3EYS8|5.0|I wish all flashbacks were as good as this one! The performance of Page, Plant, Jones and Jason Bonham is incredible. The concert at the O2 Aren in London was a one of a kind charity concert. Led Zeppelin does not disappoint. Stong aggressive rifs from some of the bast songs they've written mixed into a live concert get you on your feet. Fantastic cinematography and sound. This concert DVD and CD are an essential for audiophiles!
B009EE13R2|5.0|Great songs and great acting. After many years, still very entertaining and humorous. Highly recommend this classic to all ages.
B009NQKPUW|5.0|Interesting and mysterious happenings in deep space, Ridley Scott brilliantly weaves a tale of the fantastic in this futuristic thriller. Excellent CG and eye candy, well scripted and acted, the explorers is this story have no idea what they are about to encounter. Fun, exciting and entertaining, hold on to your seats, the future is now!
B002VRZEYM|5.0|Fantastic documentary with great insight into the industry of food production. I truly believe this should be watched by every American. BUY LOCAL!
B000002MIY|5.0|The second installment of the now infamous the Travel Trilogy, (Nightfly, Kamakiriad, Morph The Cat). Fagen with the help of producer and Steely Dan mate Walter Becker explore new arrangments in Fusion. Fagen takes you on a Sci-fi trip into the future in his new Kamakiriad (Japanese for Praying Mantis) car. \\"The tech is Balinese\\", he claims of his new steam driven ride, which also has a hydroponic garden, \\"Good fresh things everyday of the year\\", it has it all just like the recording. Precise play and a tight band drive the recording from beginning to end. He warns us that \\"this route could be trouble\\" while on \\"Trans Island Skyway\\" while trying to make a final deadline.  The lyrics and arrangements have matured since his first solo effort (Nightfly) and the songs through the recording exhibit that growth. The Narrator, (Fagen), takes you on a series of adventures in his new car highlighted by three incredibly arranged songs: \\"Tomorrow's Girls\\" (a virus wearing pumps and pearls) which is a take of a B-Movie story line; \\"Countermoon\\" when it rises \\"there's a chill in the air, there's a countermoon lovers all beware!\\"; and \\"Snowbound\\" where the narrator wishes to sleep in with his love and prefers to \\"wake me up, when the wolves come out to play\\". Sophisticated engineering and mastering by Becker make for an almost Steely Dan experience, but it's more than just that. It's truly a work of art. Clean recording with a minimal amount of reverb allows you to feel the power of the arrangements. Fagen's imagination drives you to unknown destinations through music, which makes for a great ride. In all, there isn't a bad song on the recording. That's what a master artist like Fagan can do almost effortlessly. Kamakiriad is a must for the dedicated audiophile!
B008J05EL8|1.0|This product is unusable to create documents.  As far as I can tell Office Suite can only be used to view documents, not edit them.  I've been unable to find the settings, if there are any that will allow office suite to edit a document.
B000002OHX|5.0|I bought the original vinyl version of Live Dates way back in 1977. The sound recording is great and accurate on the original. Remastered on to digital, it still has a great sound. The many songs played live are incredible. A great addition to your music collection!
B0037QGS0K|5.0|If you are a Julianne Moore or Amanda Seyfried fan, you love tyhis movie. Both play thier parts really well. I bought it in Blue ray to add it to my collection, I would say what the movies is about but i dont want to spoil it for you.
B000E5N62U|5.0|The third installment of the trilogy that began with Night Fly, followed by Kamikiriad, and now the ending with Morph The Cat. Brilliant fusion arrangements and melodies. Some with a funky beat. Donald Fagen is one the history's greatest composers and songwriters. Listen to all three chronologically and you'll get what he's singing about!
B003VANOFY|1.0|Wanted a wireless headset for my computer and bought this. I plugged the IR device into my PC but no matter where I placed it I couldnt get the headset to connect. I gave up and bought a wired headset which works
B009KHDT0C|5.0|The return of a ver serious Barnabas Colins in the 1970's is wraught with witty banter. Well scripted and hilariously dry with disco as a backdrop, poor Barnabas struggles with life 250 years after his death. everything suprises and astounds him and his reactions are unexpectedly funny! Johnny Depp is one of today's great actors!
B005HEPIDS|5.0|Being a trekkie all my life when this series came on T.V I watched every show through the end of its series. When the DVD's came out I bought them all for my collection. Since there isnt any form of Star Trek on TV today I sometimes pull out the DVDs and watch favorite episodes. AND thank you Amazon for adding the complete series to watch online for free.<br />If you like this series you may also want to check out the the series Enterprise, though it only lasted four seasons, it was a good one too
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This is probably the best book I have read in a while !<br />I couldn't put my kindle down<br />I recommend this book to anyone<br />I can't wait for the movie !
B0044C5SCU|5.0|Not much to say, except that this was the best season.  At this point in the series, the main characters are all pretty much fully developed, so the story line keeps your interest.
B0087JTAKW|1.0|The author's clear opinion that he is making profound statements about life and the meaning of time could not be more wrong. The condescending tone of the book is offensive and the book itself is poorly written and, at points, downright silly. I regret that I wasted money and precious hours of my life on this collection of high and mighty sentiments.
B001FVV2X2|4.0|As with any series, it takes a while for the characters to gel.  This one is off to a good beginning.  A little sloppy in the first few episodes as it is a bit unclear which direction the show is going, if any.
B008K6HN8I|5.0|When I'm missing the usb micro cable or in a rush I can still connect to my device, RIGHT ON.
B007TK77QE|3.0|I really enjoyed the character development as I could relate but first half was bit slow. I'd consider 3.5 stars.

B0094K20FK|5.0|This is my favorite movie if the original Star Trek crew. It's smart and very much like the original series. Ive watched it dozens of times. It's fabulous!
B005K0HDGE|5.0|This was by far one of Mr kings most intriguing and captivating books.  I have read almost all of his books and read this one in less than four days.  Absolutely could not put the kindle down.  I was sad to reach the end, but the ending was wonderful.  I commend him on another great success.  What talent.  So entertaining and yet very thought-provoking, especially if you lived in this time.  Ruth
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|excellent fun book to read.  sweet love story and exciting twists and turns.  Similar to her other books but better.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I look forward to every evening when I can sit down and enjoy the show.  The characters really come alive in this story.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|was a fan of the first game, so I thought I'd try this one after reading the reviews. Temple Run 2 is so much fun to play and stupid hard too, I love it.
B00A11AN6O|5.0|I had alot of photos in my smart phone that were all mixed up together. real pain when I would want to show someone a pic of something. After downloading the pics to cloud [was easy and fast] it was so simple to put them in folders and arange them how i wanted them. Once done sent them back to my phone to put them back on my phones memory card and still have them in the cloud for safe keeping. Love it  Andy
B003M6EAXM|5.0|awesome show, happy i finally finished it, its like a weight lifted off my shoulders<br />great season. Will never watch it again.
B00AYDC3CG|3.0|The movie was cute, and had it's momments. The amazing part was how it was all done with clay animation.
B008CJ0KI8|5.0|Frank Ocean's, channel ORANGE, is the kind of album that I can listen to over and over (and I have!). He doesn't tap into the typical hip/hop & r&b formula to have a hit. His songs take you to a deeper level and that's what I love about him! I was disappointed that the area where I am from (El Paso, TX) haven't played his music. Since he came &#34;out&#34; that his first single was about his first love (a man) and has been openly Bi or Gay, or just anything but straight, the radio stations have not played his music. It's almost a shame because THIS IS THE NEW R&B along with The Weekend and singers like Miguel. Buying this ablum is a must for those who are tired of the same old crap you hear on the radio. It's modern with a twist of 90's r&b. I love this album! Now go buy!!
B00BB8SKPW|3.0|After hearing people review the movie, I was expecting a little more heart pounding, plot twisting movie. Most of the movie was predictable, and really the plot lacked depth. I would of just assumed watch it when it comes out on Amazon Prime.
B005FISC52|5.0|I remember when I first started watching One Tree Hill during its first season.  Now that the series is over, I do miss it.  This series presented you with a lot of drama and a lot of unexpected situations.  Season nine is a great way to celebrate the end of the series.  Dan has made it through thick and thin throughout his life on One Tree Hill, to see his life end was different.  It was nice to see that Nathan and Haley came around and let Dan back into their lives.  It is also good to see Brooke get everything that she has ever wanted.  After what she has been through in Season 5 thru 8, she deserves the happy ending.  When Xavier did come back into the picture, I was just waiting to see when he would attack her next.  I like that Brooke had a battle with the other Tree Hill Café owner.  To see those two come together at the end was a nice touch.  For this ending season, I wish that Lucas and Peyton would have been in the picture more.  I think that would have made the series a perfect ending.  I suggest this series to anyone.  It always keeps you wondering.  It is highly addicting.
B009LXEBD4|5.0|I was leaving on a road trip & needed new tunes, I am happy with fast service & CD !
B007FEFLTO|4.0|Start with the first book of the trilogy. Mesmerizing. A little contrived at times when character lives cross. Historically, I felt I was there.
B00000IAU3|5.0|fast service, I had this CD before and LOVED it, friend borrowed it & never got it back, had to have a new one !
B0095ZMMCK|4.0|He strings words together that makes the story so interesting and involved that you can't stop reading!  Love the characters that keep coming back.
0060936223|5.0|Right off the bat, you know Patti Smith is an eloquent writer. She speaks so poetically and full of passion. She's such a brilliant woman, and seems to always have both feet on the ground and her head out of the clouds. She and Robert had one unique relationship. It's such a shame that he had to die at such a young age.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I saw the movie preview for this book and it looked good so I decided to read it. I have to read the book before seeing the movie version because the books are always better and then I see the things I read through my own mind instead of someone else. This was a great book and although I am still wondering who he was writing to I plan on reading it again just in case I missed it the first time. Very good and quick read. Loved it and have recommended it to my oldest already.
B00BB8RKH6|5.0|Denzel plays a diffrernt role.  He a top notch performer with a heart. Greatmovie do not miss.  John Good man has some good lines . The movie is thought provoking.  I liked that the owner of the airplane understood the implications. it was really good!
B00821OX98|5.0|Good sci fi, lots of alien killing and post apocalyptic fun. Can't wait for the newest season to come out.
B009PAETCG|4.0|I. like it but nit that mush some levels u have to buy and download I don't like it well I like it is free
B0044C5SCU|5.0|The third season is even better than season two. With Amazon Prime it is free and the picture quality is excellent, using my PS3 and Amazon instant video.
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|It's a great way to improve observation, memory, and speed. Fun and challenging. I like trying to beat my record.
B009WO7NQO|2.0|Very dissapointed.  Very few levels come for the $2.99 I paid. If you want additonal levels then you have to pay more.  Very sorry that I purchased this app.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|Enjoyed it a lot.  Became addictive.  Can't put it down.  Want another version of Jewels.  When will it be available?
B00APUQRPC|4.0|I  enjoyed  all  the  actors  in  this.  And  it  seems  like  Mr.  Eastwood  just  gets  funnier  as  he gets  older.  I  understand  why  he  does  a  lot  of  movie  production,  now.  He's  good  at  it.
B004EF65QA|5.0|My all time favorite movie. Even better than the bbc version of Pride and Prejudice.<br />The ending is the best of all Gaskill, Bronte and Austen adaptations.
B005PK56TA|5.0|The story is really interesting, the acting is fantastic, and so suspenseful and fun.  There were times where I literally yelped and jumped in my seat. Scariest tv show I've ever seen. It was awesome.
0765348276|4.0|My first impulse was to give this three stars because it was such a brisk read. After books by Martin and Stephenson, and Follet's historical fiction, it somehow felt wrong for a book to be so short. And after reading Wind-up Girl and Name of the Wind (which was also too long), it felt wrong for a book to be so terse with descriptions. Yet I enjoyed it immensely, recommended it to a colleague, and can remember space elevators, the green skin and cat eyes of the reborn soldiers, the details of land and space battles, and bladed aliens and their alien worldviews.<br /><br />In other words, the book left me with vivid memories of its actions, characters, and setting - all without excessive detail and exchanges. And it did so without sacrificing story or character. One reviewer notes that the book's elderly were more like college students than seniors with decades of experience and learning. This makes an assumption that the old are all deep and wise, preferring reflective conversation to locker room and lunchroom banter. But anyone who has hung around senior centers knows they can be just as \\"youthful\\" and bantery as a dorm hall or a military barracks (where many of the conversations of this book take place).<br /><br />It'd be nice if other publishers allowed a return to shorter novels that sail along.  Although I do not care for the distinction \\"young adult,\\" it seems clear why books like Hunger Games have become so popular. \\"Adult fantasy\\" has gotten so long and the writing so ponderous that it can be a chore to pick one up.<br /><br />Scalzi's ideas and style are a refreshing change of pace. Other reviewers compare him to Heinlein, whom I have never read. After his, I am ready to give his books (and others by Scalzi) a try.
B001NHNG64|4.0|Doing a good deed for an attractive FBI agent leads to an encounter with one of the many anti-government groups operating in this country. In typical Jack fashion Reacher establishes himself as a match for any situation in any environment. A good read for Reacher fans-new or old.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Safe Haven<br />A little different than the other novels where everything goes splendidly. A little more action in this one. I loved it.
B003LQ3YXU|5.0|Love Dr. Who it is one of the longest running series and the best.. Keep making Dr. Who..My grandchildren watch him all the time and my granddaughter is having a Dr. Who birthday party.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I really enjoyed the book. would have given it five stars if the ending were different. I'm not crazy about books (or movies) that don't finish the story by the end of the book. I am now reading the next book in the series to find out how it ends!!! Overall a great book!
B001UGB1X8|3.0|pretty well done.  Somewhat disjointed but that is the nature of the story line.  Dave is a flawed man and the movie does well in bringing that out
B001BKVWYG|4.0|Another keeper, my understanding that the documentary has created a bit of a  cult following and a revival for Rodriquez.
B00197POXG|5.0|I watched the show on tv for the past few years and feel its so wonderful.  I decided to buy the whole set.  It is the only DVD I have ever bought and it was worth it.  I can watch shows I like and watch them as many times I want.  I would definitely recommend this DVD set.  Its in a good case a little heavy and awkward but keep them safe.
B001TCHDPS|4.0|Cannot understand why this guy was not a hit in the states? He is a true poet who has lived the life.
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|This story leaves me thoughtfully tearful, as, like Hazel, I couldn't help but fall for Augustus. Thinking of what we leave behind in this world, scars or lesions, these characters and their survival stories leave me knowing I'll want to read their story again and again for all of its whit, charm, and sincerity.
030758836X|4.0|I don't know how many times I've remarked to others that, given the unsolved murders vegetating in folders by the tens of thousands in cold case file storage rooms all over the country, you just never know who your neighbors and acquaintances really are; what they've done in the past, or are possibly doing now. Maybe even those you think you know...you really don't.<br /><br />Gone Girl is that remark come to life in modern society. The book is eminently readable from the first sentence.  The two protagonists are husband and wife, Nick and Amy, each telling their story firsthand. Amy's, at first, is through a diary. Nick's is simple first person narration. They meet and fall in love, begin a storybook life in New York, then both lose their jobs and Amy's sizable trust fund disappears. After a move to Missouri, to Nick's hometown, Amy's New York persona seems to have adapted fairly easily to life in a small midwest town.  But Nick is such a jerk to her! She's trying so hard and he doesn't appreciate it.<br /><br />Nick, on the other hand, when it's his turn to talk, seems likable enough; if not a bit on the selfish side, and when you're in his POV, Amy seems a bit too prickly and thin-skinned.  I went back and forth, feeling they both needed to grow up, compromise, sit down and talk out their feelings.<br /><br />Not far into the story, Amy disappears.  As with any suspicious disappearance, Nick becomes Suspect #1.  With his  twin sister as his staunchest ally, Nick fights to prove his innocence. However, Amy's diary is troubling in its depictions of Nick's behavior, especially in recent months.<br /><br />(Note:  Gillian Flynn's peripheral characters are recognizable and reflective of our society, especially where \\"true crime\\" is concerned.  The Nancy Grace character, the media in general, the tabloids, the high-profile attorney, the search parties - all gave the book a very \\"right now in history\\" feeling.)<br /><br />Then came part two of the book.  It's a shocker.  Let's just say - Scott Peterson has met his match.<br /><br />I feel that at about the 3/4 point in the book the story got a little too fantastical, but it didn't ruin it for me.<br /><br />I know the ending isn't popular with many reviewers.  I hated it...but not in a \\"bad review\\" kind of way.  Because as I thought about it more, I had to go back to what I said in the first sentence...you never really know...Let's just say - Scott Peterson has met his match.<br /><br />I feel that at about the 3/4 point in the book the story got a little too fantastical, but it didn't ruin it for me.<br /><br />I know the ending isn't popular with many reviewers.

B004SIIBGU|4.0|I love to sift through eBay looking for hidden treasures, but the search options could be a little more user friendly as far as being able to refine them more thoroughly. If I'm looking for bat-wing tops, for example, I don't want to see 1200 results because the app won't let me select a size from their menu. It's kinda a pain in the rump, but seriously, it's a first world problem that can be navigated around if you're that determined. Searching on my iPhone is easier, but after getting my Kindle Fire HD, I'm in love with the bigger screen. I guess size does matter after all...
B009UX2YAC|4.0|There's so much hype when you're playing this game. It's like adrenaline! I really enjoy it. It's fun to unlock knew characters. My favorite place far was Rio, Brazil.<br />Tyra
B008XG1X18|2.0|Nothing like having to jump through all sorts of hoops just to pin a damn picture on my wall whenever I find a pretty picture. It's not very easy to use, but I don't like their iPhone app either. It's so inconvenient that I find myself not using this as much as I'd hoped.
B007ZGBZHE|5.0|I love the Pendergast series! This one does not disappoint, though a bit less adventuresome than some of the others!I cannot wait until the next adventure!
074322454X|5.0|If you're remotely interested in history and/or WW2 just do yourself a favor and get this. I couldn't get enough of Band of Brothers. One of the best series ever. I'm not remotely a WW2 buff, but I enjoy history. This is incredible. Made me teary. Made me look at veterans in a totally new light, seeing an accurate portrayal of what they endured.
B00AFCEIB0|3.0|It's ok I don't really see the benefits from just using the Internet google.com. The one thing I didn't like was that the screen didn't rotate when u moved the kindle as if it was locked. Other than that its alright. Could use some more work on the graphics and fix that problem and I think it would go a.long way.
B00A9C3RB8|2.0|honestly this story was not funny, not deep and actually quite slow.  There was so many lost opportunity for humer.  The whole and only premise to the story was about trying to revive the sex life after 30 years of marraige. Thats all you get!
0316224588|3.0|I've read several Ian Rankin novels and 2 others featuring Rebus. The story's most compelling aspects are the relationships among the characters, and that kept me interested for much of the book. BUT, the \\"bad guy\\", the whole reason there is a story, is grossly under-developed. No motive, no history, no sense of who this guy is they've been after - I was thoroughly disappointed in that. I don't need the sometimes tiresome one-chapter-bad-guy, next-chapter-good-guy (italics for bad guy) BUT I hated the wrap up in this book. Did Rankin write it knowing as he wrote that he was going to take a totally cheap shot just as his readers were most intrigued by who the murderer was. With just a few pages to go I was up for a real twist, but there was absolutey no punch in the revelation.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|My husband and I are both hooked. Great cast, great costumes, great story. Do not want this series to end.
B00296A4F4|5.0|Having the flu is what brought me to this. As I lay here in bed like a slug, I needed some cheering up and what better way than with a show called GLEE right? I felt pretty embarrassed at first. Because I am not much of one for popular tv shows. But I soon came around to understand that this was a great show. The musical numbers are fantastic, and the variety is nice.
B00AREIAI8|3.0|the game isn't bad. I really haven't gotten far enough to race but so far its fun. graphics are nice.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|found this game at work cause I have a lot of free time and it keeps the time going. never had a problem with this app. even if you finish all the levels you go back to get better scores
B0095ZMMCK|4.0|Fast moving story. Great characters. I highly recommend it. It is a little scary that some of this stuff could really happen.
B008FTAAG2|5.0|I purchased this album and its great.  I Recommend it to anyone who likes metal. Use Amazon to purchase albums cheaper.
B00004RFFS|5.0|Loved this movie and had to add it to my collection of classic and well acted horror films. The quality of the dvd is excellent. I recommend this product to other fans of quality horror stories for purchase.
B00AREIAI8|1.0|Dwnlded app helped my son with it and began to have fun. closed app to do another and then came back to it. now it will not work. it only opens a blank screen. dissappointing.
0446554995|3.0|I love the Pendergast series. I became addicted with the first book &#34;The Relic&#34; and have gobbled up each book as they were turned out. Unfortunately the last few books have been weak in their story line and character development. They had so much potential to be more. I have a sense that the authors are weary of writing about their special agent. Which makes me sad since I enjoy this character very much. I can only recommend &#34;Two Graves&#34; to serious fans who wish to keep up with the life events of Aloysius Pendergast.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|I cared about Pat and what he went through. Very well paced. Loved the montage scenes. Fora anyone wanting to get immersed in a good read, this book will do it.
B0070Y46UY|1.0|HAD to read it because someone in my book club suggested it.  Couldn't wait to get through it. One person in my group liked it - the rest felt the same way that I did. Turns out that the person suggesting the book had heard from friends that the MOVIE was good..... Waste of time for sure!
B008IJTFYW|5.0|Helps me fall asleep and relaxes my 4 year old. I really like this app! There is ads once and a while but it's free!
B0089EHWQE|5.0|I loved this book.  Beautifully written.  I found this book so appropriate as we wrestle with the overwhelming problem of when one can end one's own life.  Since this was on the Massachusetts ballot, it sure rang a bell.
B007UXT6T6|5.0|Very surprised, getting bored w/ Tom Cruise MI movies, this was a good twist. Not everything worked, which is unusual for MI. Tried to watch on TV through the internet, kept cutting out. ended up watching on my pc.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|One of the most beautiful books I have ever read. It will break your heart ans leave you wanted more. My all time favorite love story. Beautifully written.
B005HSL626|5.0|I didnt think this game would be fun using your finger, but it is challenging for all ages. My son loves it but I find myself sneaking in some play time also. ;)
B0089EHWQE|5.0|A beautifully written  story that really touches your heart. Character development kept you guessing and wanting more.  Really great read!

B008RZF1UO|5.0|The new singer Tommy does an excellent job in this new album. The music is great if not a little dark. The story behind the songs is interesting. You can tell a lot of love went into this album. I look forward to seeing them again in concert.
B0086700CM|5.0|He plays this app non stop. It is very fun and I even find myself sneaking in a play or two... when he will let me.

B00AREIAI8|5.0|this game is a must have for horse lovers everywhere i rate this game 5* because as a horse lover myself i would if i could rate it a 1000000 but sadly i can't sooooooooo if you love horses i highly recommend this app
B008JGSM6G|5.0|me and my 6 year old love this game. It can be as easy or as hard as you want it to be.
B003WUYRGI|4.0|This dictionary was very<br /> Helpful to me and probably very helpful to others to! I will never  forget this dictionary!
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love that this app connects straight to facebook and twitter. I also love how your friends can see what you pinned.
B00AHXIC50|5.0|almost every song on this album is good! i can just listen from beginning to end..and then play it all back again!
B0096I9UTE|5.0|Kylie continues to out do herself. Abby Road Sessions is thoroughly enjoyable. Kylie just shines on this like the great artist she is!!!!
B008V0OLOW|5.0|This is another great CD by Diana Krall with a new and enjoyable twist to it.  I would highly recommend it as she simply outperforms herself on this CD.  Enjoy it!!!!
B007MU85D0|5.0|I had only heard one of their songs before buying this album but at the price I figured I couldn't go wrong. I really enjoy most of the tracks. There are a couple that aren't so great but they aren't bad enough for me to intentionally skip them when they come on.
B006R1T40I|3.0|While her voice is still beautiful, there were a lot of uninspiring songs which she chose to cover. The Dylan covers were the best.
B001OQCV6A|5.0|When I saw this movie in the theater, I found it witty, a great example of steam punk theatre. Still love it.
B001GCUO1Q|5.0|I loved this movie when I saw it in the theater, and still love the movie. Hugh Jackman is beautiful.
1442355476|5.0|This is a good book with a lot of intrigue.  I travel a lot by car and I enjoy books on tape to help pass the time and I like Vince Flynn's books
B00ANW33CM|5.0|I love the Majong games and this one is a real challenge that you will spend hours challenging your skills
B000PKX2KA|5.0|Just this and Bing Map is a really good pair. I bet this and some kind of software would be great.
B004EBZX6W|1.0|it does what it says but the phone tells me pretty much the same thing so its really just is taking up room on my phone. I unistalled it
0307887960|4.0|I lost 33 lbs. with this diet and it was easy to follow and the foods were good, not exotic, like The Plan.  Would recommend this book.
B002JF1N0A|5.0|Late in life, I decided that this is one of those books I really had to read.  Now I regret not having read it much earlier.  It is so clear and lucid, I can now understand how it made such an enormous impact on publication (and of course since).  Not surprisingly, parts are rather dated: some of the genetics he discusses has since been shown to be wrong, although the overall discussion is so robust that it makes no difference to his conclusions.<br /><br />Even if you don't have any scientific background at all, I a sure that you will find it an enlightenment.
B00A4CHZ2K|5.0|We watched him win American Idol and was glad to see he didn't stray too far from his roots in singing.  I enjoyed the music on this album and think his &#34;Home&#34; was one of the best songs ever written for one of the finalists.  It seems like you hear it everywhere, I hope he gets royalties!  I am looking forward to the first album he has complete control over, because that is when I think he will truly shine as an artist.  Until then, if you liked him on American Idol, you will enjoy hearing him again on this album.
B006LSZECO|1.0|I bought this book because it was at the top of many lists but what a waste of time and money. This is the slowest book I ever read for this kind of money. The narrative is fine but the story is boring and slow. A lot of fuzz in the middle for the same. the book  or outcome of the book doesn't change with or without all these pages.<br />Very disappointed!
B0095P29EG|5.0|I really enjoy the whole marvel series. I can't wait for iron man 3 in May!  This is a great show that has many graphics.
B005HED11Y|5.0|I haven't seen these shows in years! It was a hoot to watch them again. The quality is very good.
B000SLP4SE|5.0|It was a good film, awesome message and powerful cinematography. Great story about what an honest American can accomplish. I reccomend it.
B0077SGMXM|5.0|This is the best and most fun golf game I've played. I love the fact that it has three difficulty levels so everyone can play.
B008MEM24S|4.0|Gets you to think and have a little hand eye coordination. Good and fun game to play! My toddler likes to play it too!
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|Another great Clancy work. It could be taken out of todays headlines. The people of the previous Clancy novels are back together fighting an unbelievable adversary.
B007ZGBZHE|5.0|What a conclusion to the Helen series of the Pendergast adventures. The storyline is outstanding. The characters are unbelieveable. The villans are the most diabolical in the series.
B00AVNQ3YS|5.0|This is real metal idon,t understand what some of these people are talking about this is better than the last 3 cd,s they have put out tired of all that chanting hyms to the gods this is start ahead hard charging metal one of the best metal cds i have heard in along time. can,t stop listening to this cd pounding metal for sure great job manowar.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|All the above descriptions apply to DA, season 2.  Time travel back to WWI era reminds me of my English history classes in college, yet the trials and challenges experienced by these characters are timeless.
B009EEFTMC|5.0|I enjoy it in my free time.  It is brightly colored and interesting. I like the puzzle mode where you compete against the clock.
0812550706|4.0|There are some pretty darn raving reviews. I was afraid that would kill the story for me. I've learned to be careful about reading reviews before reading a book because of that... Anyway, it had an easy-to-follow writing style, mixed with some complicated world-building. There's a pretty cool setup. Not \\"WHOA OH MY GOSH\\" interesting, but it fits. I quickly grew to like Ender, and I felt for him as his innocence was slowly sucked away with isolation--- losing friends, no control of his life, his choices, etc ---but he started to annoy me after a while. I love rooting for the underdog. So when he was put on a pedestal, I lost that initial \\"attachment\\" factor, I guess. I mean, it's not fair for me to say that because obviously the story wouldn't work without that happening, but I can't help it.<br />That was a very minor thing I disliked, and it isn't the reason I give this less than 5 stars.<br />I just didn't feel like the ending fit. It felt too fast...but at the same time too slow. It's hard to explain. But it just left me feeling a little unsatisfied. And when I write a review, I give stars based on how the book made me feel when I close the cover. I lost my underdog love for Ender and the end was OK but not great.<br />Other than that, the rest of the book was WOW. Lots of very insightful quotes. I will probably skim through this several more times because there's a lot to take in here as far as military strategy stuff and human psychology. Overall this was a great story but a sort-of unsatisfying ending.<br /><br />(OK, I know there are a couple squeals, but even if there are, there should be a feeling of finality at the end of a book, which I didn't get here.)
0375846735|2.0|I loved the Golden Compass. But The Subtle Knife was hinting to the downfall of the trilogy as more //kind of useless// story lines were added...and then this happened. It's a good book, don't get me wrong. Pullman's writing style flows smoothly and his imagination is endless. But it was very scattered. As I was reading, I kept losing the suspension of disbelief factor. There were too many plots to wrap up. I felt like he was forcing characters together by coincidence too often, just to wrap up a plot. (furthermore, a lot of those plots had point to the rest of the story.)<br /><br />The whole \\"religious/anti-religious\\" stuff didn't bother me too much in the previous books, but here it got distracting. I actually said \\"Ugh,\\" out loud sometimes. I'm not sensitive to religious things, but I feel like it just needs to be more subtle when presented in a story, or else it feels like someone is lecturing you. And that's NOT the experience I want when reading a book.<br /><br />I'm not even going to mention the anticlimactic climax and all the plot holes everyone has already written about.<br />(OK I feel like I have to get this off my chest, though: UGH WILL. And what the heck happened to the old Lyra? I was growing very attached to her, and then she just fell apart when Will showed up. -_-)<br /><br />So, it was a chore to finish. But once I did, I realized I did still like the characters, beneath everything. (It's hard not to...I mean, we spent around 1000 pages with these characters!) I felt like I'd gone on that epic adventure with them, even though it was a little unfortunate everything ended so scattered and whatnot. I give it a 2.5.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game and the reason why I chose this rating I  Because  everyone e knows this  game and has it and you can even play with friends from Facebook and I think I should recommend my whole family to play this thanks !(:

0984725113|3.0|Erik Brynjolfsson, Andrew McAfee: Race Against the Machine: How the Digital Revolution is Acceleratng Innovason, Driving Productivity, and Irreversibly Transforming Employment and the Economy<br /><br />Ford CEO Henry Ford II and United Automobile Workers president Walter Reuther are jointly touring a modern auto plant. Ford jokingly jabs at Reuther: \\"Walter, how are you going to get these robots to pay UAW dues?\\" Not missing a beat, Reuther responds, \\"Henry, how are you going to get them to buy your car.<br /><br /> An industry tale related in:  Erik Brynjolfsson, Andrew McAfee: \\"Race Against the Machine.\\"<br /><br />How, indeed, Mssrs Ford and Reuther? What's the answer? Though told tongue-in-cheek, this anecdote describes perfectly the daily encroachment by machines (computers in various modes) on terrain traditionally held by humans--laborers, secretaries, shop-keepers and even doctors and lawyers--chronicled in the thought-provoking \\"Race Against the Machine\\" by MIT authors Brynjolfsson and McAfee.  As they make clear this is not a matter of the future.  Already to a far greater degree than most people realize, machines perform some of the most demanding intellectual and physical activities, from medical diagnostics to analyzing rocket engines--to designing improvements of themselves.<br /><br />Unfortunately, at the same time, though few are yet aware of it, computers and artificial intelligence are also rapidly creating a painfully dysfunctional economy in which ever-fewer workers will likely be needed to produce the goods and services for the global population.  Americans watch as the median income growth stops, unemployment rises, inequality in income and wealth increases. The authors began the book in the reasonable conviction that digital technologies are among the most vital driving forces in the economy, but concluded as well with the warning that \\"their impact on employment is not well understood, and definitely not appreciated.\\"<br /><br />Though theauthors never specifically mention the term, the realities of the outcome of the contemporary race between man and machines that they depict might well be a second American revolution, if not in the streets, at least in the economic, business and social worlds. Looking carefully at what's going on suggests this is not an exaggeration. They acknowledge that while some of what the nation is experiencing in the \\"Great Depression of 2008\\" is due to \\"cyclicality, outsourcing and off-shoring, taxes and regulations...\\" what's dangerously lacking is a more profound understanding of the fundamental \\"role of acceleration of technology.\\"<br /><br />Optimists respond that America absorbed huge shifts in jobs when, between the 18th and 19th century, agricultural employment dropped from 90% to 41% (today it's 3%) when farmers and cotton pickers got city jobs. This, however, was a relatively slow transition over two centuries and really doesn't equate with the current tempo where \\"the transition can be cataclysmic.\\" During the recession of 2008 nearly 1 in 12 people sales persons lost their job; many saw pensions disappear.  \\"Accelerating technology in the past decade has disrupted not just one sector but virtually all of them,\\" they write.  Wages declined for many Americans; borrowing \\"masked the problem,\\" until the Great Recession, resulting in a severe drop in demand.<br /><br />The economy ended up in a \\"dysfunctional series of crises.\\" Traditionally economists argued that the benefits of technology gave to the economy as a whole--through increase in aggregate demand because of falling prices-outweigh the costs of some unemployment for certain workers. But the assumption that workers can always find other jobs now is challenged, not by economists but by reality. The farm-to-city analogy doesn't necessarily hold. Electrical engineers, of course, won't have to worry.<br /><br />Because they are speaking to the cognoscenti, the authors don't bother to detail much of the spectacular progress in microprocessing--in both processing speed and storage capacity--in just the recent decades. Though there are those among us who remember buying the Commodore computer with its 64 bit processor, or the \\"portable telephone\\" (as it was called) the size of a loaf of bread, processors have now shrunk to where they can be inserted in human arteries. Processing speeds have soared because of parallel processing (e.g., dual or more computers) or, even more importantly, algorithms--which are far more responsible (by a factor of 43:1 per a White House report) for increases in speed than hardware-- a fact most observers find astounding.<br /><br />X-ray lithography makes possible ever-tinier chips. Advancement in optical fibers is breathtaking, both for (ever-cheaper) long-distance transmission and for integrating electrical and optical devices on the same piece of silicon; This enables computer chips to communicate using pulses of light (instead of electrical signals), resulting in smaller, faster, cooler and more power-efficient chips than is possible with conventional technologies. Everybody today encounters microprocessors at every turn--the \\"life-support system for the modern world,\\" as Byte Magazine noted already in 1996. Today there are few areas of human activity untouched by computers.<br /><br />One word--exponential--goes far to explain what's happening--exponential (repeated doubling) growth of processing power and even (much) more with algorithms.  Processing power is the electronic capability of components--silicon wafers, new materials--and software to handle data.  The authors turn to an old Chinese tale to explain exponential growth.  The inventor of chess brings his innovation to the emperor who is delighted with the game and asks the inventor to name his own reward. Supposedly modest, the man asks for rice based on the formula one grain placed on the first square of the board, two on the second, four on the third, eight on the fourth, doublingsquare to square all the way across the board. Halfway across the board (32 squares) the amount is equivalent to a large field of rice. To fill the last square takes rice the equivalent of Mt. Everest.<br /><br />That, the authors emphasize is exponential growth and that's the pace being set by computers today.  Many experts believe the world is now entering the second half of the \\"chessboard\\" example, where speed of growth will be phenomenal, literally unimaginable to us today.  For instance, huge progress is being made in pattern recognition, widely considered the foundation of human thinking, and hence basic to reproducing the functions of the human brain.<br /><br />In one application computer-driven trucks failed miserably; six years later Google made a fleet of Toyota Priuses  fully autonomous, driving more than 140,000 miles with only minor assists from a person behind the wheel.  Just watching a robot climb steps is impressive; but now Foxconn, a Chinese company with 10,000 robots in operation, just announced it will have a million functioning within three years.<br /><br />Interestingly, the authors themselves fail to keep up with exponential growth, not mentioning the sudden emergence of nanotechnology (nanotech) which is already rapidly challenging silicon technologies.  Nano--certainly a breakthrough of quantum dimensions--promises to accelerate markedly the most basic operational functions of artificial intelligence, computer processing and robots, and offers applications across the board of medical, mental and environmental sciences. Computers are comparable to the great economic levers of the past--the steam power, electricity, the internal combustion engine of our day--and now they have additional muscle with nanotechnology.<br /><br />Regrettably the super technical achievements of IBM's \\"Watson\\" supercomputer in defeating the best human contestants on the television show \\"Jeopardy\\" were somewhat  obscured in the entertainment emphasis of playing the game. Few viewers really understood the technical grandeur of what they were seeing.  The parallel computers process hundreds of millions bits of information gained from encyclopedias, newspaper and magazine articles, academic journals, the web and the Bible.<br /><br />The description of Watson's functions boggles the mind, but what's really remarkable is its (his/her?) ability to understand puns, similes and metaphors.  All done within milli-seconds. Watson was much more impressive than generally realized: He's far smarter than any human. Moreover, given the operation of Moore's law stating that general artificial intelligence capability doubles every eighteen months, Watson already has a far brighter cousin.<br /><br />In their final chapter the authors state their case. \\"We've stressed that computers are rapidly encroaching into areas that used to be the domain of people only, like complex communication and advanced pattern recognition. And we've shown how this encroachment can cause companies to use more computers and fewer people in a growing set of tasks.\\" Yet, while expressing \\"cause for concern,\\" they somehow maintain, \\"we clearly are //not// pessimists about technology and its impacts.\\"<br /><br />This is problematic to reconcile with their recognition that technical progress makes, \\"jobs a critical issue of this time,\\" and that very \\"few other people were focusing on the issues raised here. It might have been useful to differentiate the impact of computers on various professions and jobs--computers will easily replace secretaries, but not likely soon gardeners, plumbers and electricians. Even more useful would have been an inquiry into how the `invasion of the machines' is almost certain to exacerbate the already socially-destabilizing inequality of income and wealth.<br /><br />On the contrary, however, based on their own reporting it would seem evident that there is every ground for being pessimistic, and that we are in fact in a national emergency which justifies sounding the alarums, blowing the sirens and alerting people to the fact that a towering Tsunami of technology is sweeping our nation and our economy. This is one book where the lengthy sub-title is a vital part of the message. The \\"Luddites\\" of 19 century England destroyed weaving machines which took away their jobles, but most later found work.<br /><br />American workers can have no such assurances. Machines--and robots--it seems beyond dispute, are going to win--and take jobs.  It's evident already that American society is undergoing severe strains, viz, the extremes of political partisanship, the emergence of the Tea Party and Occupy movements. The question to Mssrs Ford and Reuther remains unanswered. Where will the new comes come from. The foundations of American society as we understand it are under assault. There may be answers, but resolving the job issue may well become Priority #1 for the society. It's imperative to recognize that humans will not win against machines, but only win through cooperating with them.<br /><br />(Note the absence of an index is inexcusable and very irritating. As a result I've lowered my rating from four to three stars.  Doesn't MIT have any hungry undergraduates willing to earn a few bucks an hour producing this indispensable tool? Or robits?)
B00005JOFQ|4.0|Yeah, it's the gay cowboy film. But it's really about forbidden love and being something you are not allowed to be on pain of death. Two men ruin their lives and the lives of everyone around them by not admitting that they're what they are. The commentary that makes the film poignant and real and, in that, terrifying and horrible, is that sometimes you can't be honest about what you really feel if you don't want society to extinguish you. The acting, of course, only rubs it in. A brilliantly acted, sensitively directed, gorgeously filmed tragedy.
B004XUMMFE|5.0|Firefly is an enjoyable way speed a few hours.  Not to heavy not to light. It is just right.  Peace
B003L77FYS|5.0|A lot of shows sag by the third season but Castle managed to hold the momentum and interest all through third (I'm not as thrilled with fourth but that's another review). Seasons 1-3 all excellent cop/mystery TV with the same sort of humor and interaction you get from Bones, but with slightly realer characters. All the background characters are as compelling and likeable as the leads too, even if they only exist to spout exposition. Great show. People who liked Bones should also enjoy this show. It has similarities and the same sort of approach and weight. And it has Nathan Fillion. &#34;nuff said.
B009WO7NQO|4.0|Great new additions to the other Angry Birds but more levels are needed.  I'm at the end waiting for more.  Bring them on soon!
B005IZLPMY|4.0|The first time I saw this film, I enjoyed it but not as much as, say Iron Man. It was based too much on an old-time mentality and I thought it was a little pat with the WWII hero paladin lead. In retrospect and after more viewing, I realize I was wrong. It's excellent. Chris Evans as the lead walks the very fine and treacherous line between being a too-nice, too-pure hero type and being just really likeable. The whole movie only works because they cast him, sort of like Thor only works because Chris Hemsworth was cast. The side characters here are all flawless in the roles they're given (though any more Hugo Weaving seems to do nothing but dramatic bad guys. Someone give the man a drama please. Not that he isn't great here). Standouts include Tommy Lee Jones doing what he always does but under the radar just a bit. He's as snarky as ever but he never steals the scene. And again--Chris Evans carries the movie by being exactly what Steve Rogers/Captain America needs to be: a little guy who hates bullies and never quits, trapped in the body of a pin-up boy. He makes the man seem real. So it all works.<br />The BluRay has good extras too, with a commentary for those of us who care, and some really interesting production specials on how they made the very tall, very buff Chris Evans look like a short, skinny 90 pound weakling. It's amazing if only for the technology and how far we've come since early CGI.
B009NYF2ES|5.0|I saw the film in its original theatrical release and can safely say this blu ray transfer is the best the film has looked ever. You can visually appreciate  what Bob Fosse was going for with the  multi layered story line accompanied by the ironic greek chorus musical numbers. Of course Liza's musical numbers are great but there is a lot more going on in this film  than is superficially apparent or even as compared to the Broadway show itself. The cinematography is great and you feel transported into the seedy Kit Kat Club and Berlin of the early 30's.The audio portion of the bluray was good, clear  but perhaps not as resonant as one would have liked but that is quibbling and perhaps unavoidable given the age of the film source. I highly recommend this blu ray for any lover of the show, film or musicals in general.  You will not be disappointed.
0792164903|4.0|Is it only me or has anyone else noticed Tim Burton has a tendency to make movies that have flat plot arcs and lack of tone shift (except for the occasional truly horrific moment involving a child or a childlike character being traumatized)?<br />This is my favorite of his films because, while it still has all the usual elements, including a rather flat plot arc that plods from A to B to C, it manages to stay engaging throughout and still closes the plotline in a satisfying way. Unlike Nightmare Before Christmas which sort of fell apart plot-wise at the end, Sleepy Hollow stays cohesive and clear all through, and has the same spectacular Burton visual style. Only real flaw--Christina Ricci's strangely stilted lines and oddly coached speech patterns. Otherwise, she's as good as anyone in the film and the character actors that glut this thing are fantastic and many.
B009D7CP2M|5.0|This is a hard read given the state of events of our times.  It is so well written its like wandering into someone else's nightmareish thoughts and events. This is NOT a book for the Squimish of heart and those prone to night mares.  I couldn't do this book in one session, it took many days to digest the trauma of this believable horror story.  Again not a book for every one yet it is every ones book to some extent.  I gave it 5 stars because it takes a sorted talent to write on this topic.
B000J3EEBY|4.0|This disk is similar in tone and execution to her Mask and the Mirror or the Visit disks and it carries on the same solid musical constructions and dreamy dark qualities of those somewhat superior disks. My only complaint here is that it feels a little bit like a retread in some ways--she uses the same sort of constructions she did on the other two and borrows some melodies from traditional songs in a way that I recognized too easily, so in that way it's not as fresh and suprising as those disks. That said, it's more of the same and since I adore those other two, it's not wholly unwelcome.
B009E3EY38|5.0|I had a party over the holidays and before I knew it everyone had abandoned the food upstairs and migrated down stairs to the music of &#34;The Zepplin&#34;.  Every one was dancing talking about the concerts in the not that long ago days of yester-years!  It was a great party addition for people mingling and getting the party rocking.  It's great on a large screen TV.  Every one loved it.  I'm not a critic I just know a good party accessory when I see and hear it.  My daughters friends were dancing and sharing some moves with the older fun crowd. We all shared a love for some good timeless music.
B0083SBM7Q|5.0|I'm sure half the world has seen this and/or reviewed it by now so I'll just say that the best choice the studio made was putting Joss Whedon at the helm of this spectacle. Only Whedon could bring his patented 9 characters in one room conversational expertise to a scene and make it not only clear and informative but funny and poignant all at once. Lots of things blow up and super heroes fly and some of the action stuff annoyed me by being too typical (huge things fly out of the sky by the hundreds to destroy Manhattan and our heroes just stand there staring. Civilians are dumb cattle who hide inside, then go stare out huge glass windows like targets. Etc.)  but overall it's great because it's about the characters as flawed, real people who happen to have special skills that make them exceptional. That the skills don't make them less human or less flawed is Whedon's real triumph. That and the cast he got. Fantastic, everyone.
0307341577|5.0|A riveting read for a housebound snowy weekend.  In some ways, I liked this more than Gone Girl.  There is a real mystery for starters, which I wasn't even close to solving.  And the misfortunes of the Day family really moved me.  The prose and structure isn't as \\"amazing\\" as that in Gone Girl, but Dark Places is more succesful in limning the way hard times can lead to heartbreak, and worse.  Libby's voice is mesmerizing, but Patty and Ben's stories are the material for the most affecting and frightening farm tragedy since In Cold Blood.
B005LAII8K|4.0|Rian Johnson does characters in heightened realities so well. This is a great example. The time travel is really incidental to the story he's telling and the situations are all in the service of the choices the character(s) make so, as a thinking man's science fiction, it's a great film. My only real complaint, given tolerance for the time travel arguments and petty details about the future etc, is that the female character is a weak link. She's pretty much the usual woman who's trying to be tough but isn't and has to be rescued by the hero for most of the film. In the end, you see she has more grit than that but for most of the film, she's really not very strong and since she's played to be strong, it's annoying. Other than that, great movie, great cast, interesting concept. Now go rent Brick for more of Johnson's character work.<br />As for the disk itself, it's a good transfer, clean and clear. I only resent not being offered a BluRay/DVD combination. Too many friends don't have BluRay so I can't loan it out to make more fans.
B00A9C3RB8|5.0|I don't believe young couples with &#34;get&#34; this movie but middle agers will definitely enjoy it - especially if marriage counseling was ever part of your marriage.  It made me laugh and cry which is what a good movie should do.
B0051T47NQ|4.0|I'm not sure what other people will think of this but I liked it very much. It's a strange little film that presumes that trolls are real and a group of film students stumble upon a man whose job it is to hunt them. Presented in the docu style of Blair Witch but with better coverage, it runs along just fine, not in a hurry to get to where it's going, but it's not boring getting there. The incidental elements presented give it a feeling of reality, as if trolls were actual animals in need of regulation by a game/wildlife organization, and not just fairy tales. With very real performances and occasional quirkily dark comedic moments, it's a low-key fun movie.
B0079R8KO0|5.0|I ordered this case now knowing for sure whether the Kindle Fire came with a case in the package.  When my Kindle arrived without an included case, I was glad I made the choice.<br /><br />This case gives you quite a bit of functionality beyond its portfolio-style design.  It also provides for mounting the Fire in a way that makes it easy to see and use while you're doing something else.  You can set the unit up on the included support frame and do homework, watch streaming video, or play games and it didn't cost you any extra--its comes with the case.  It is lightweight, durable, and you can bend it back the way you might bend back a notebook or book cover in order to get done what you want or need to do.<br /><br />I use it quite a bit for studying, and that feature alone saves me from having to balance a reader, a notebook, and/or a laptop all at once in my two hands.  I highly recommend this product for anyone purchasing a Kindle Fire (original) and is actually intending to use the device!
B008CPZNL6|2.0|Firtsly, this is a great app, on the iPad, it rocks, and the interfaceis quitw snappy and responsive, but for some reason on theFire HD, it slows to a crawl!  Thereare multiple occaisionswhen i had to reboot to get control back.  I solved it by uninstalling it.
B00AN93Q0O|5.0|If you are a Twenty One Pilots fan this album is amazing, some of their best new work with some of their best old stuff. If you aren't a Twenty One Pilots fan, you should by it too.
B001UTW7QU|5.0|I originally watched this series on Fox when it debut years ago. I then purchased the DVD box set when it came out to re-watch my favorite episodes.  Now that the series is over I wanted to re-watch to see if I can put all the pieces together knowing what is to come.<br /><br />The quality of the stream on Amazon was great. I ended up watching on both the online browser through Firefox and on my PS3. Wanted to check out other shows before I jump back into season 2!
B008GWSS6W|5.0|Great movie! Love John Wayne and Maureen O'Hara together!!!! Lots of action and fun to watch!! I watch it often!
B003JUGQ38|5.0|If you love Doctor Who, you know why.  If you don't, well, some things aren't for everyone.  I love Doctor Who, and I loved 10.  The stories are great and David Tennant is an excellent Doctor.  Should we get into a David Tennant vs Matt Smith (vs Tom Baker?) argument?  No need.  We all have our favorites, some more than one; and just being a Whovian means you are part of something special.
B00785P2QC|5.0|So much fun. Better then most SIM games on here. I love the fact that it runs by itself.<br />And best of all its free.
B008GVD6D8|5.0|As soon as I finished the first I had to read this one..Same as Bared to You I couldn't put it down..LOVED IT!!! have pre-ordered Entwined to you and until that is due to be released I will be reading Bared to you and Reflected in you again and again..
B003ES5ZPK|5.0|This is not the cheapest adapter.  I couldn't figure out which direction I wanted the thing to bend, so I got this one just to be sure.
B00866H7SS|5.0|This book was Well written,The Characters are amazing..I couldn't put it down..LOVED IT!!!<br />You just want to know what is going to happen next after you finish a chapter so you just keep reading..Well done Sylvia Day..
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Very fun game.If you love horses then you will love this game.Its all about taking care of a horse and competing with it
B006LSZECO|5.0|Great, great book. Just when you think you go it figured out everything gets flipped. Totally recommend as a good read.
B008476HBM|4.0|I gave this book a four out of five as it is an absolute classic, I have read this book a few times now. great book
B001ANSSDC|3.0|Not what I expected. Book tends to drag without much excitement. Wonder if movie could be possibly better. Good if you are an Eagles fan.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Great story line. Kept me interested. Did not want to pit book down. Read in one day. Would read again. Going to see the movie Thursday. Hope it is as good.
B007IXWKUK|4.0|Good character development; nice plot complexity and - really! - a bit more believable. I like that Ana has become a proactive participant rather than just a foil for Christian. On to the next...
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is the greatest game in the history of apps! I cannot stop playing and I never go a day without playing this amazing game!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This game is so awesome . I really enjoyed it  a lot I have a feeling I will always love temple run 2
B0089LT8Y6|5.0|Another must have album to go along with: The Legacy, New World Order, Practice What You Preach, Low, The Gathering and The Formation of Damnation.  Those albums are absolutely required.  There are others worth the time but get all those.<br /><br />I have listened to thrash since it was started.  I bought Kill em all on vinyl way back in the day when it was released.  To me, Testament is the BEST thrash band ever except for Slayer.  If you have neglected to give this band a shot do so immediately.<br /><br />A day in the death is a personal fav here.
B004UXUX4Q|3.0|I'm not a major fan of George Clooney, so that could be why I wasn't impressed. I think he did a good job acting, it just wasn't the type of story that appealed to me. It's a nice time waster, but doesn't have much to hold your interest. I wouldn't use my review to base your option of buying or not. It does have a child using poor/strong language, which is unappealing to me. Overall it just wasn't a strong enough movie for me to recommend.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Gillian Flynn is a fabulous story teller. I love all of her books, but this was a masterpiece. The story flipping back and forth between the two main characters, and then it hits you! BAM! I was so shocked! But it wasn't the twist that was the best part. She makes these character so vivid, so extremely intriguing. I want more Ms. Flynn!!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|A definite page turner, I didn't want to put this book down, thanks to my teenage nephew for recommending it.
B0027MJU00|5.0|The plot for this book was fabulous. Everything intertwining, from everyone's perspective, into a gruesome bouquet of a story. My mouth did drop a few times while reading, I have to admit. But I could not tear my eyes away, I was compelled to keep reading. I love Gillian Flynn's writing.
B001JP5JRY|3.0|If you watch How I Meet Your Mother then this is a funny companion.  I was a little disappointed that there really wasn't anything new that was added.  The majority of the codes are just a re-hash of what was in the show. The explanations of the some of the codes are really funny.<br /><br />I would have liked things that were not on the show in the book.
0307744434|5.0|There was a lot of hype about this book, but it was all very justified. This book was fabulous. The story so magical, I felt as if I were in a magical world myself. It made it seem very possible. A very unconventional love story intermixed with illusions and true magic. Fabulous.
B006AZZPCM|5.0|My OOB ( &#34;out of the box&#34; ) experience wasn't so great but I've been using it regularly over the last couple of months and have been very happy with it.  I' noticed some of the reviews were unhappy with porn ads; i haven't noticed ads of any sort which doesn't mean there aren't ads, it just means I haven't noticed them and quite frankly it wouldn't hurt my feelings to see more ads for straight porn.  I wouldn't need this ad if YouTube would get their stuff together and figure out how to support a mobile world but apparently that's too much for them to figure out.  In the mean time this FREE player works pretty well and I think that's reflected in the download count.
B005HSG3VK|5.0|This product is great.  The price, the security of it is great. I like how it is the right thickness and easy to get into it and the stand up fixture is great.  I like the color and everything about it.  I would tell friends about it .
1591391105|5.0|Excellent option to persons who want to initiate a new job and need a light on the road to how maintain communication and correct work with the new superior.
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|My friend told me about this and it is a great game to play when I am stressed and just need to relax.  It makes me mad and always talking to those pigs.  I have told others about it and we talk and laugh.
B00AREIAI8|2.0|good if u get board.  is okay:)  :? it takes forever to gain a level. zzzzzzzzzzzzzz oops. I just fell asleep. if u like horse's. get this app
B004UPANGM|4.0|This movie is a classic for any hororr fans. The movie can be cheesy in many points, but it was made in the 80's.
B007SGM084|4.0|This is a good book. I am glad I had the Kindle version of this book that way I was able to read it wherever. But I would say it isn't a book that you should just read anywhere, you never know when the &#34;interesting&#34; parts will pop up!
B0081BU42O|3.0|I am a fan of Iain (M) Banks having read all his books. This one is weaker than most of his Culture books. I enjoy the creativity of the utopian lifestyles that are introduced and the descriptions of the set peices / battles are excellent. However, the story itself just doesn't work for me. Found the ending rather dull. (I won't give anything away in this review).
B004JN1D2I|5.0|The Kindle version is wonderful. I am not all the way through these books yet but I can't wait to read them on my Kindle. Plus I love that I can download the kindle app on my phone and IPad so that I can read my books whenever!
B0035LJY6C|5.0|That's what this movie brings to life. This movie is among other classics that have the talent to see the darker side of life in a light way. It's almost the embodiment of sarcasm. I am jealous of the Addams' life, even with all the turmoil that happens. They still manage to be happy in their unhappiness. It's dark humor, it's stylish, it's class and degradation at the same time, it's tasteful deprivation, it's an oxymoron that works. It makes me remember to stop and have a laugh at life and not take it too seriously, even when I have an appreciation toward the darker side of life. It's one of my favorite movies of all time, and an almost perfect example of what I would like my life to ultimately become.
B0081336FO|5.0|Best updated version of classic character.  Acting is excellent and the story lines are modernized in a very realistic way.
B0013O123Q|1.0|The formatting of reversed storytelling was not effective. I get where they were going with it, it was an artistic spin on the title and events of the film, but I don't feel it was right for the story. Other than that, the \\"artisitic\\" angles and dizzying cameras were downright horrendous. The story itself is even flawed as in there's no build up to the events, and this is especially true with the reverse storytelling. The climax of the film is at the beginning, and then it dwindles down for the rest of the film. I like films that make some kind of sense, and this one didn't. It's the story of a woman, her ex whom she's now friends with, and her current partner. There's items toward the end/beginning that are supposed to disturb us, as in her partner saying how he wants to make love to her in a certain way which resembles the way she was assaulted, and her dream of the red tunnel breaking. But rather it just seems too forced and I just felt it was completely lacking any depth. Rather, it was kind of a \\"Reality TV\\" look at the events, and even then not compelling whatsoever. The brutal scenes are what everyone has said they are, brutal. But I am left with this film not really saying anything to me. It didn't speak to me. I don't know what the point was. To show that sexual assault and revenge are brutal things? Hopefully, everyone knows this by now. I'd rather just have the 2 hours of my life back.
B0095ZMMCK|4.0|Tom Clancy does it again with &#34;Threat Vector.&#34; It is a tense, page turner that is also a good read.
B0010SKTRA|5.0|A look into the history of human anatomy through modern research into the bone structure, eyes, etc.by bringing out<br />interesting and little known examples, Your Inner Fish is a book hard to put down.  I really look forward to a second<br />go through.
B007L6VR12|5.0|These children are so different--you love the characters who actually appreciate them.  This movie will actually leave you feeling good...highly unusual in theatres these days!
B00A8ECU24|1.0|My daughter loves MLP and has been waiting all afternoon for this game to finish downloading. So far it has taken 4 hours and I'd only 70 % done. I am so disappointed, and my kindle is new and has very little saved on it yet. Not impressed at all.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Wonderful story and great that I could download it onto my iPad.  Super convenient! A must read story for people who love to read love stories.
0525953728|5.0|I never read books. I bought this, and in two evenings I was done. Could not put it down. The author paints a world very few know about, but doesn't appear to reveal so much that it would compromise the way we do business. Assuming its all true -as advertised- this is a must-have. What makes it even more appealing is the fact that the author does not indulge in bravado and thump his chest throughout the book like nearly every other SEAL book published.
B0050I2P32|5.0|Brilliant and beautiful album. I would recommend it for any Joy Division fans, it will remind you of this great band that left us wanting more all too quickly.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This is a great app!  I really love memory feature. It's hard to  believe a free app has so many useful functions.
B0095P31L6|5.0|The whole movie is very clever.  It was like watching an old time cowboy movie.  I think Johnny did a great job in this movie.
B0052RDHTM|5.0|Loved it! Such a great way to learn history. Follett is a master storyteller. I am almost sorry it ended.
B00364K6YW|5.0|Love this movie. The acting says as much or more than the words! Great chick-flick. My husband even watches with me!
B004X4R49Y|5.0|I have wanted to see this film since it was first released and expected it to be great.  But, the movie surpassed my expectations!  I always love Colin Firth in his roles, but Geoffrey Rush was outstanding as the speech therapist.  Both men were wonderful and truly deserved the awards and nominations they received for these roles.  Seeing the trust and friendship develop between Lionel and \\"Bertie\\" was the best part of the story. I was so happy to read in the closing information that Lionel continued to assist the king, and the two remained friends for the rest of their lives.  I really loved this movie!
B00992CF6W|5.0|Super good game. Sadly it doesn't have animals in creative mode. Or else I would have put chickens in my coop when I made the exact replica of my house.
B004UPALT6|1.0|bad movie for me. sorry guys, just not my cup of tea. i could not open my eyes. But then, im not a fan of old movies :[
B00ABXA1HI|5.0|Absolutely perfect and flawless for streaming video and audio from my main computer. With this program, I have no need to store large files on my Kindle.
B00000099Y|5.0|Its hard to believe this album came out in the 90s, it never gets old, gets the point across, track 13 blast it down the streets of California
B00B2V66VS|5.0|As an adult, I am not in to the Temple Run app game; but my grandson is. And he is very good at it and enjoys playing the game. It may be his favotite game of all. I would recommend this for all children ages 4 and up.
B005MW5CWW|5.0|Though new to this band, this album became one of my obsession albums for several weeks. I would continuously play the album all the way through on long road trips.
B004LWZWBU|5.0|Whether a bird lover or not this is a wonderful movie.  Can't go wrong with these 3 actors and and beauty of nature.
B002VECM72|5.0|i really enjoyed the movie the blind side so i thought i would order it and add it to my movie collection.
B001XUJMZK|3.0|I've heard great things about this movie, it was ok. I wouldn't watch it again but at the same time don't feel like I &#34;wasted&#34; my time watching it.
B008JFUTT0|5.0|I was on the edge of my seat the whole time.  The first musical artist documentary with a mystery twist that I've seen.  The focus is not on how powerful and popular the artist becomes, or how much money he makes, but the on the message of his artistry and humble way of life, a way that connects to everyday people--without the pomp.  Rodriguez is truly amazing, a model human being, a very talented artist, and a gentle person.  Everyone should see this once (if not more times).  Only complaint, wish it was a little longer, the 87 minutes goes by fast.
B0083GQKQG|3.0|Excerpt:     Lynne Ramsay's We Need to Talk about Kevin (2011), her first feature in nine years and an adaptation of the novel by Lionel Shriver is, to put it simply, spectacularly messed up.    The story follows the life of one Eva Katchadourian (Tilda Swinton) as she gives birth to her son Kevin (played at various ages by Rocky Duer, Jasper Newell, and Ezra Miller as the child, youth, and teenaged Kevin respectively), struggles to raise him to doubtful young adulthood and, much later, live a life made lonely by ostracization from the entire community--though not necessarily in that order. Ramsey shuffles the time order, her way of echoing the novel's structure (a series of letters written by Eva to her husband that look back on her life), leaving clues along the way of something terrible that happens--will happen--later in the film, possibly the reason for her isolated status.    Read the rest at    [...]    [...]
0525953728|4.0|A good book, still undecided on author's intent totally but it was informative and not overly rated.  I would recommend to purchase a paper copy, then go see the movie Zero Dark 30; as its told in the CIA's perspective of the actions that occured. Will fill in gaps and make sense of things that actually led up to finding/killing OBL.  Still a great shoot!
B009UX2YAC|3.0|I think that it is the best ever,& I hope they make a second one if you do not have it get it!
B008HK3XKO|5.0|Worked as stated.  Protects the Kindle Fire HD great.  Opening/closing turns it on and off.  Easle like so you can prop it open to read.<br /><br />Very good value compared to the prices of similar Kindle cases.  Would recommend it.
B004VLZUI6|5.0|Just a really fun movie to watch. Just brings you back to the good old days. I could imagine being back in High School.
0316017922|5.0|Malcolm Gladwell has something important to say. He makes an elegant case, employs agreeable logic, and is a colorful story-teller. Even if you disagree with his primary arguments, you will surely enjoy the craft of his artisans' prose, and learn something new.
B000RH0C8G|5.0|I have read Michael Lewis's other works and this one is no different.  I really enjoy his writing style.  I am not a baseball fan, but reading this book made me want to create a fantasy league team to see if I could build a winning team!
B007T2XC7A|3.0|Norah Jones is still the same great singer, but the songs in this CD are just OK.  It is just not was soulful and blue as before.
B004JZBGWI|4.0|I still need to experiment with it. I learned about this ap from a lady in a grocery store using it for a grocery list and she had it down  pat. Once I slow down and experiment with it I already like the it interacts wikth my Kindle. Dates on calender with notifications.
B0063IH60K|4.0|a great version of solitaire but like many free games this on has ads that can get slightly annoying. still -its a great way to kill time.
B004XZR63M|5.0|This book changed my life. Definitely a must read for anyone looking to avoid living the 9-5 grind life. On level with books such has Think and Grow Rich, and The Richest Man in Babylon. Read this with an open mind and you'd be amazed at where you could end up. It does not provide any direct advice or steps, but it does make up for it in talking about mental preparation and general principals.
B0052RDHTM|5.0|Fall of Giants: Book One of the Century Trilogy  Excellent story and great history lesson set to a fictional storyline.
0307474259|5.0|Gary Taubes has turned conventional wisdom on its head. The way he presented and supported his hypothesis make you wonder why we weren,t aware of this before. Could it be the vested interests of those who want to keep us clueless and fat. It's so obvious, it reminds me of the V-8 commercial where you slap your head and &#34;I coulda' had a V-8&#34; instead of the info I've been getting and continue to struggle with fat and weight.<br /><br />  If you 're serious about your health, be very afraid of the conventional wisdom and why the federal agencies like the USDA and NIH and private associations like the AMA got this so dead wrong.<br /><br />  Phil Tripician
B009O07NMA|5.0|I love this CD!! It's the only one I have that I love every song on it. It's been on repeat in my car ever since I got it.
B007VUCAVO|5.0|After reading the reviews for this I never gave it a second thought about paying for the full version. This is a great app. Not too much more to say that hasn't already been said.  I am amazed at how accurate it is. Hats off to the developer.  Great job.
B005IZLPMY|5.0|I love this movie. It is one that I could watch over and over again. It never gets old =)
B00A8ECU24|3.0|I got this for my 20 month old grand daughter, but it turned out to be one of those games that goes on and on, like Farmville.  she just wanted to play with the ponies,, I am sure if the kid was older she would be more into it, Maybe an 8 yo would be more inclined to do all the stuff needed to fullfill objectives.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|This book was not what I had expected it too be when I started out. It was written from the perspective of Death, during a very dark part of the world's history . . . The Holocaust.<br /><br />Very well written, very moving.<br />It proves that some people  know the right things to do . . .even if they are on the wrong side. They know<br />goodness and compassion.<br /><br />Very well written. I highly suggest reading this moving story.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Needs more sensitivity for better game play. Otherwise the amount of objectives are the right amount and strategically beneficial to game play.
1609611543|5.0|Excellent book that teaches a lot about wheat and its effect on so many aspects of your health.  Definitely will make you think about changing your eating habits - and also suggests wheat is a major contributor to current epidemic of diabesity and obesity.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Very good game. I love taking care of horses during this game yessssss okay everyone go play this game please okay
B005CRQ2XA|5.0|It was awesome<br />I love all the books I wish I could read more but I'll have to wait till I have money
B009JBZH54|5.0|The &#34;Dark Knight&#34; Trilogy arrived on time and was neatly packaged.  The disks were in order, the package was secure; nothing was out-of-place or ruined.
B000OZ0NXA|4.0|When you read Lee Child there is the distinct impression that he had spent time in Georgia. The details and scope of the movements of Reacher from place to place requires a specific first-hand knowledge; it's not abstract or contrived.....unless its someone elses memory. I saw the movie recently released and read the book tied to that screenplay (One Shot); decided I needed to start at the beginning to see now L. Child brings the character alive. I would recommend taking the journey with Reacher it looks like it will be an interesting one.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|I couldn't put this book down. It was romantic and fun, made me cry and laugh. There was so much keeping me on the edge of my seat. I loved that it wasn't just a typical love story. Fights, gambling, fire, death and even a musical breakout in the lunch room. Wish there were more books like this one. Can't wait to read walking disaster.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I really loved this book.... the only thing I dint like about it was words were mixed around.. and the grammar was wrong... but overall a very very great book! :)
B00AREIAI8|4.0|This game is great ... I decided to download because of the high rating and now I know why it is a high rating I would recommend this game to any horse lovers
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This book was not only very inspiring to one's personality but to the way they truly feel about themselves. \\"Perks of Being a Wallflower\\" was not what I expected in a very good way. This book is an original and has good values and traits people should have to live a happy life (aside from all the drug usage). While reading it, it honestly made me happy and thoughtful of all the things in my life. I love this book and will probably read it again.....several times.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|This app is vey prettier than normal fb is very clear and organized and runs Facebook better 10x than any Apple product

B00AREIAI8|4.0|I think this app is fun. I get to learn about horses. You get to feed your horse and groom it.
B0052RE4MQ|5.0|This book is a really great. I love the romance and the adventure. This a book I would definitely read over and over again. Ally Condie is a truly gifted author. I look forward to reading the next book in this trilogy.
B00AQ71FLK|5.0|this game is very entertaining and you can enjoy it both solo or in multiplayer node for free. I highly recommend trying it.
B00AO2P3GA|5.0|This game is bad ass.  The graphics are great.  I have not played video games since i was a child, but I love this game.
B001XUJMZK|5.0|Braveheart is always good entertainment. I enjoy watching it two or three times a year. Mel Gibson gives an excellent performance playing a roll that has some basis in history.
B005CKPQNE|5.0|More twist and turns then the first 3 seasons.  Great show, I hope The series never ends.  I am a breaking bad addit.
B0091HVMVO|5.0|A careful selection of the  best of Philips CDs both artistically & sonically. A real bargain. The only problem was the enclosed booklet that dropped to pieces at the binding & the very brief information on each cover. The CDs, however, are really superb.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|temple run 2 is funner and is cooler, but the original temple run was easier and had better graphics. I still like temple run 2! BTW,does anyone know what the 2,500 and green arrow at the beginning mean?
B0002KZAKS|5.0|This is a great mic, regardless of the price.  While it may be inexpensive, it is far from cheap.<br /><br />Did not think this was as warm as the sm58, set at the same EQ.  Changed the EQ a little bit in the mid and high section and received nice tone.<br /><br />Primary use is for our church's worship services.
B0018RWMNM|5.0|Best picture ever. Just makes you cry how he kept his promise to his friend. Love all the actors in this
B007URVZJ6|5.0|I've been using Adobe InDesign to format books, and with Amazons free plug-in for InDesign, creation of Kindle books should be a breeze, but I also tested creating books in MS Word, which is not made for creating books, as is InDesign.<br /><br />By using MS Word, and followed the directions in &#34;Building Your Book For Kindle, I get the paragraph spacing I want. This is not so.<br /><br />The excellent, easy to follow direction in &#34;Building Your Book For Kindle&#34; make this a no-brainer.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Cannot let the cat out of the bag..things do not go the way I would write them, I guess , but I am hooked anyway!! I could not wait to see the final episodes on PBS, so in one sitting I watched the whole third season. I am hooked and eagerly awaiting the 4th season. The cliff hanger on season three may be more than most of us can bear... these folks are a part of our lives now and we will never want it to end. What an awesome series....and the actors may want to get on with their other lives, but we hope not!!
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|I love this game!! It's difficult, but not so hard that I feel stupid playing it. I don't play this kind of game very often, because I usually can't and get really frustrated.  Not with Jetpack!  It gives you all sorts of easy goals to reach, like how far you slide on your face, collect &#34;coin's&#34; when you are dead.  I recommend this for anyone!
B008XBCJ34|4.0|Watch this baby in 3d and see the difference. Comes in both formats, 2d and 3d. Sure is a lot cheaper then the theaters.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|After watching the Hunger Games, I had to know what happened to Katniss Everdeen.  I had the paper book version available of Catching Fire and blazed through it.  Not having the third book, I turned to my trusty Kindle and borrowed the book.  Mockingjay did not disappoint.
0786955570|5.0|I would recommend this game to any fan of fantasy themed board games. I've always enjoyed the dungeons and dragons universe and this game is no exception. While it may seem daunting to some, keep in mind that the game contains outlines for different adventures with varying difficulty levels.<br /><br />There are a lot of pieces but not all of them will be used for each adventure. Also, the rules can be flexible. Its kind of like landing on free parking in monopoly.  Depending on the house rules you may or may not get $500. Not everything is black and white where the rules are concerned. Let your imagination run wild. You can also use the pieces available to custom make you're own adventures. Or combine the other adventure system board games and dungeon command skirmish games to this and get even more creative. They all interconnect.<br /><br />The miniature figurines are not prepainted so have some fun painting those as well. If you dig deep enough you can find user generated content online to add to your game. There are additional themed cards for monsters, heroes, encounters...etc. You can even find user created adventures.<br /><br />Now if only I can find friends to play this game with. I'm only kidding. My wife enjoys playing and I've even played a few games over FaceTime with my brother and his family. That takes some extra preparation though. All in all this game has brought us hours of enjoyment with a lot more to come.
B008Y6QZ56|5.0|This little gem received little promotion but is well worth seeing.<br />The plot is well done although it was a bit confusing at first trying to understand why two different UFC fighter's stories were being depicted.<br />Tom Hardy is an amazing actor. I first saw him in the latest (and possibly worst) Batman movie. His onscreen presence overshadowed Christian Bale's. He carried that movie, I feel, along with Michael Caine...<br />Well worth seeing. It is one of the few movies, as of late, that I plan on viewing again.
B000QK7YQ2|5.0|As a old dirt bike rider I can't say enough good about this movie. Even 42 years later I still stay glued to the screen. Bruce Brown and the whole cast and crew are professionals like no others.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I could not put this book down......it has the most perfect ending the book xould ask for!!! I would reccomend this book to anyone who loves to read. Nicholas Sparks has done it again!
B004I744AS|5.0|I like this dictionary app a lot.  It is easy to use, yet has many features.  I love how it has a feature that will say how the word is pronounced.  Good free app.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|ok i got this app a long time ago and now i play it. so i got a kindle card for chrismas and i got dobble coins and got coins and i got on this game last night and every thing was gone sk i wased 5.00 on this game
B004VMUS9G|5.0|This is hands down my favorite app I have on my Kindle fire.  The alarm clock has taken the place of my cell phone one and my real one on my night stand.  It is super easy to use.  My favorite things about the app are how you have many alarm sound options and there is also an option that makes you solve math problems before snoozing.  This is the alarm I have been waiting for...gets me out of bed without being too grumpy.  : )
B00992CF6W|5.0|Really fun awesome game .I play it all the time . I think somethings they should add are: buckets,Redstone,Endermen,rails,enchanting,potions,caves,and the end . This would make the game even better than it already is . I rate it 5 stars and love it
B005CRQ4GU|4.0|I like this book because it actually life lesson like don't count on everything to go right because it might not.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|Okay, it's clumsy to carry it around.  I am thinking of getting it on Kindle so I can finish it.  I am starting to like the whole Kindle thing.  And, I like this book.
B001UV4XIS|5.0|With this DVD my collection is complete. I love the story line, the system of magick, and the great, dramatic adventure. For a first-time writer, this is a spectacular series. I look forward to more great stories from this marvelous writer.
B000SXMSJ0|4.0|I love Norah Jones. This cd is my go to, it's in my car and on my ipod. I take her everywhere. Fun and flirty music.
B005LAII1C|5.0|As soon as I watched &#34;ted&#34; in the cinema, I knew that I was going to purchase the Blu-ray copy!
B0050VJ29Y|5.0|Excellent cd. Great mix of instrumental songs and songs with lyrics. I love Norah Jones and Jack White is amazing.
B00A6D5GBE|5.0|Slow download and install on my kindle fire. Good graphics and smooth play. Help is very good but you have to be quick to decide which way you want your sleepwalker to go. First games/dreams are easy as they should be then there is no mercy. Very smooth playing and very enjoyable. Think this will keep me busy for a long time.
1451695195|5.0|I thought it was a new understanding of what the after life will be like  for me.  The writing was a little disjointed.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I'm not one to read a book after I have seen the movie but a gave it a go and loved it !
B005GSVFBE|5.0|Finally got this on 3D.  Good animation, and a good movie.  Nice to see more 3D movies coming out for those of us who have a 3D TV.
B005OCFHHK|5.0|These are my favorite books and movies! I am so glad I have them all on Blu-ray now. The price was such a great deal I couldn't pass it up!!!
034580404X|4.0|I loved the story line in the Fifty Shades Trilogy, but was a little disappointed in the ending.  I expected a little more at the end.
B003L77G6A|5.0|Howard's hoochy pants make the move on Berny. Leonard makes his move and ends with a Bazinga. Great times to be had.
B008HK3XU4|5.0|This is a good structural case for our Fire.  It protects the device and I like that, especially since it goes many places, and my daughter likes the way the case works to hold it at her viewing angle.  And it does this at a very reasonable price.
B0053O89WY|5.0|It's not what it looks like. She was lying Sherlock. Well don't i look sill with this thing on my head
B005ZTFPFQ|2.0|Need joy sticks with this game. Maybe it would be ok if you had more time and better game instructions
B004EPYZV2|5.0|My favorite MI movie.  Its the second act in which everyon and everything goes to heck in a hand cart that sells the film
B0072GPPNC|5.0|Love this movie, plus I can loan out the DVD to family members who don't have Blu-ray. Worth it to see and own.
B001FB4VXU|5.0|Sheldon would you be willing to take on a ice slurppy equalivancy in this moment? Now leonard you know I can't do that.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is very entertaining and depletes boredom well. I wish I could obtain more gems easier but overall it's a fun game. I would  recommend to anyone.
1442346949|5.0|This is a must have for any techy or apple fan boy.  Great look into a business mind for which never walked into a business class.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I recommend this book to anybody that likes entertaining reading, it will keep you interested until the page. I enjoyed it immensely.
B0030V0PEW|5.0|I found The Checklist Manifesto a very thought provoking book and very well written. To error is human and we are creatures of habit. This makes a checklist a great tool for avoiding mistakes and bringing structure to the chaos of hospitals and healthcare so that strangers can function as a team in complex settings.
B008VBYN80|5.0|I like the simplicity of the game. There is no real thought u have to do with this game. I love it.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|What an amazing and first hand recollection of life in war. The decisions that are made and the clarity and faith in those decisions. Soldiers. Sailors. Marines. All are amazing men and women to decide to stand on the front line for us. I feel I have a better understanding of the challenges and pure grit it takes to defend our men and women on the battlefield, and the need to stand by them when they come home to us!
B00APUYWYA|4.0|Enjoyed this movie except for one scene. Why is it that people think scenes of people throwing up are funny? I gagged through the entire vomit scene!
B0083SBJXS|5.0|This movie is what it says on the box. If you like fun fast paced super hero movies, you'll probably like the Avengers. The characters are well written, and the story is well laid out, especially considering the number of characters in the movie.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|Cannot remember any other series I've enjoyed this much.  Cannot wait for Season 3!  Actors and actresses were perfectly selected for their roles.
B005SS2QXS|5.0|This protector is inexpensive for three pieces and went on first time without any bubbles and excells at non-glare and anti smudge protection!
0525958002|2.0|I very much looked foward to reading this book as I was a huge DD fan as a child and my 1st crush ever was on John. Having said that I was a little disappointed by the lack of emotion throughout. Some have complained that he doesn't really discuss much about salacious little details about his time in the band but for me that wasn't such a big deal as I can understand not wanting to air the dirty laundry of your friends. What really bothered me was the complete lack of emotion when discussing his own life and trials. It seems as though he only spared about 2 sentences each on the loves in his life...akin to, \\"I dated her, we broke up\\". Huh? you were engaged to this woman. Even in his writing on recovery there is very little on how he coped. Even his friendships with the bandmates are never delved into. After reading it I'm not sure he even likes any of them. One person you can tell he really doesn't like is Andy Taylor which is probably because Andy's book, \\" Wild Boy\\" , which was a much better read by far but also had many details about John which he would rather not be told I assume. I also assume that is the reason for the animosity. In short the book has it's moments but if you really want some insight into the band read \\"Notorious\\" or \\"Wild Boy\\" which was even better. It's funny because as a child Andy was the only one I didn't like but after reading his book I have a new appreciation.
B0063IH60K|5.0|This is a fun app . I could do with out the advertisements after starting a new came everytime . But i like the game.
B005NFW0U0|4.0|We really love this series. The third season is just as good as the first two. This particular episode is nothing special but definitely part of a bigger pictures that is quite the work of art.
B008XG1X18|5.0|This is a fun app even though I dont have a facebook you can still look on the site and get great ideas
B001UTW7QU|5.0|The first few episodes draw you in with the weirdness of the cases, but you'll stay with it for the charming cast!
0452273331|2.0|Reading this book was the awful.  The characters are overemotional and the book is too long.  I wish I would of not purchased this.  dont believe the hype with ayn rand.
B007D5E7C2|5.0|i always stop and watch this when it's on tv/cable, so i finally decided to buy and add to my dvd collection.
B000002KAT|5.0|This is my 2nd favorite album of all time (1st Jackson Browne- For everyman).  It gets better with each hearing.  NOt rock not pop.  Just amazing.<br /><br />Hard to explain but it just deserves listening,  then you will understand.
B009SQRL4U|5.0|Great movie. Very funny . Perfect for the whole family. Great to watch all year long . Ho Ho Ho.
0553284347|5.0|This book is so real and true.  If you have had any type of past this book explains everything in detail.  At times, this  book can be painful to read because it is so real.<br /><br />Shattered my existance.  Please buy this book, if you buy any book in the next 10 years!!!!!!
B002WV5A9G|5.0|Got the digi version free with purchase for 48 hrs that blows but the movie is so hard to stop watching. Great characters actors action plot I really enjoyed it. I still love my old school star trek but this one is just too cool.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Great drama, great costumes, rich characters and cinematography. Can't believe how hooked I am on this series.  I highly recommend it!
B000NTPDSW|5.0|Okay im gonna just say it, ive never seen any godfather movie, ever! But this collection was so cheap (25 bucks when i bought it about) and so tempting i though heck, ive got to see this apparent classic sometime, and ive never been more pleased! Great packing, great early delivery, and great movie set, i give it two thumbs way up!
B0020MKTOS|4.0|Typical Eastwood movie, fighting for the underdog. But less heavy and with a nice cultural angle and what's right about America.
B000PA9Q6E|5.0|not a big fan of live albums but thought i give this cd a shot,haven't been disappointed.....the ensemble is first rate.....players are having fun......a joy to hear Muddy Waters voice again he sounds great....nice interaction with him and the other band members as they take turns steppin out breakinit up...breakin it down
0345529057|5.0|Bought this because my BF got me hooked on the show. Turns out I love reading the books more than he does! This product is excellent, the books are not heavy if you throw them in a bag to carry around. No problems with the print or binding. Excellent price for four books of my liking.  Would definitely recommend.
B006XF5BTG|5.0|I always thought that I was a \\"hard gainer.\\"  After reading this book, I realized how much I was over training.  Since following the training recommendations, I am up in weight about 2lbs of quality muscle per week and have more energy even after a tough workout.  I would recommend the plan to anyone looking to gain size quickly.  It is a simple program.  Just push yourself harder each week and you will see results.
B00000DLVA|3.0|Bought this after hearing Erase/Rewind in the movie &#34;13th Floor&#34; (very interesting flick). Thought perhaps other songs will be good too - was disappointed. Some songs were OK, but nothing really strong on this album. Should have just bought the one song...
0062511408|5.0|Un libro muy interesante, una vez que lo empiezas no quieres dejar de leer. lo recomiendo a todos los lectores!!!
B007ZTLLMK|1.0|Fun game, however, didn't play for 2 days, but was the highest battery drain on my device. What's up with that? Uninstalled.
0316224588|5.0|I have read everything from Ian Rankin and have missed Rebus; what a thrill to start \\"Standing in another man's grave\\" and find Rebus.  I hoped that he would return but thought he might try the private eye business.
B001EN71CW|5.0|Absolutely loved this series.  Still cannot understand why it was only one season.  All of us wonder why it did not continue!
B00AF6MF9I|4.0|This game is very enjoyable and I can't stop playing it, but there are a lot of fixes needed. Not enough to make me stop playing it lol.
B004ZJZPXO|5.0|I absolutely loved the &#34;Firefly&#34; series and the movie was wonderful since the series only made it for one season.  I am happy to be able to own it to watch whenever.
B001EC2ISA|4.0|Alec Baldwin is everywhere, these days.  Big, fat, old, Alec Baldwin.  Like the rest of us, his age.  Folks not familiar with the handsome Baldwin brothers will be shocked at the studly, youthful, Alec Baldwin in this film.  Sadly, he's fully dressed for the entire film.<br /><br />Oh well.<br /><br />This is one of the early works of Tim Burton, and like pretty much all of his stuff, it's a twisted, delightful, piece of work.<br /><br />A nice, decent, young married couple drive off a bridge avoiding a dog and find themselves haunting their own house.  The house has been sold to a couple of city folks;  the spineless husband is nice enough, but the grasping artsy wife and her entourage are as repellant as they are meant to be.  Their daughter---a goth teen---however, can see the dead.  And she meets up with our recently deceased couple.  They, on the other hand, are finding it difficult to manage the transition to being dead, and while seeking &#34;official&#34; help, end up caving to the weakness of man's soul, by calling Beetlejuice, to help rid their old house of its new occupants.<br /><br />Oh dear.<br /><br />The film is pure entertainment, from beginning to end.  A bit facile, too quick to please, a tad sweet, but that's only because we've seen later Tim Burton stuff, and we know where he went.  Try to remember that when this came out, we didn't have that advantage.<br /><br />Few directors these days turn out so many consistently good works in a single genre.  Tim Burton is one I still pay money to see in the theater.  And I love to watch this every now and then on DVD.
0802473156|5.0|At first I didn't believe that books such as this would be able to clarify things for me as a man; but I was completely wrong. It truly helped me get a better understanding of myself and the Love I have for my wife and how I can be a better husband to my wife as well as how she could be a better wife to me. I true understand that Love is a choice, but if one Loves someone in a marriage that they will choose to love you as you need them to in order to feel loved, secure, respected and full and you will reciprocate that feeling.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|great app. definietly get it!!!! I am having so much fun!! it is free and fun entertainment.go and get it. it is free so why not get it?
B005T87QCI|1.0|i bought this game and it wont load on my phone. kind of wish I could get my dollar back.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Fantastic end to the trilogy. Definitely keeps you reading with all the turn of events!!  I will recommend this trilogy.
B00574P9EQ|4.0|This was my first time renting from the tv/computer and watching instantly at home without having to go anywhere. The quality and sound were not completely clear.  But otherwise great and hilarious film! Loved it!
B001ANSSDC|5.0|Just  a fantastic read. I started this book when the sun was out...  and now I can't see out the window. Simply put this book inspires and instills hope into your heart.
B004TI5N38|4.0|David Baldacci never disappoints when it comes to exciting and different story lines.  I was swept away to this rural town and praying for their safety.  Could not believe what he did at the end.  Highly recommend this book.
0307352145|4.0|Despite the best of intentions, I don't read much nonfiction. Oh, I've enjoyed the biographies I've read, and I've actually finished a few self-help books (although they usually fall into the \\"reference\\" category rather than  linear pastimes).<br /><br />But when I happened upon the TED Talk by Susan Cain, I knew I had to read her book from cover to cover. I have long been fascinated by behavior and personality. When I learned about the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator many years ago and discovered how incredibly accurately it described me (as an INFJ), I began to categorize & analyze everyone with whom I came into contact. Some I'd even pester to complete an informal  online assessment so I could compare my analysis with their results.<br /><br />Ms. Cain's talk was upbeat and empowering, and I expected the same from Quiet. So, I was rather unpleasantly surprised when I found myself growing annoyed with the book. There are sections, especially in the beginning, where it seemed to convey an introverts-are-superior viewpoint. The casual humor of Cain's TED Talk was totally absent from the written narrative, and it made these portions of the book unappealing. I recall thinking, \\"Wow! An extrovert reading this would probably be offended,\\" while at the same time acknowledging that an extrovert might not perceive the material as insulting if the bias was even noticed.<br /><br />My teenage son, who is also a strong introvert, stopped reading after only 30 pages due to the same reaction. To be fair, I don't feel he gave the book enough of a chance. (Then again, he's not an avid reader unless something really captures his attention... like Harry Potter.)<br /><br />I finished the book in a relatively short period of time (for me, for nonfiction), and I did find it interesting in many ways. Of particular interest were the tales of problem-solving in mixed I/E relationships (parent-child, mates, teacher-student, friends, supervisor-employee). The cultural aspects were also intriguing.<br /><br />Introverts, I grok. Extroverts remain, to me, largely alien creatures. Some of their qualities I envy (such as their general affability and social ease), while others are like nails on the proverbial chalkboard. However, I'm trying to understand & develop tools for effective interaction. As such, I recommend Quiet to anyone who is or cares about an introvert. Watch the TED Talk, too. In fact, watch it both before and after reading the book, then please share your thoughts in the comments on the Glass House Reviews site.<br /><br />~ Mia House for Glass House Reviews<br />(c) 2012 Glass House Reviewsuing.<br /><br />Introverts, I grok.

1567184855|5.0|I Love this book.  Dr. Newtons findings agree with what I have learned and expanded on it.<br />A real interesting read!
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Nicholas Sparks has a knack for making a reader find itself in every character he writes about. This is by far one of his best novels.
B004JZBGWI|4.0|I like and actually use note.  I keep things there for easy reference.  I wish all apps worked as well.
0307346617|3.0|I thought this would be a novel but its just short stories about the progression of the &#34;Zombie War.&#34; It was hard to get into. Hopefully the movie will be better.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|The horses look so realistic in this game! I love how you can rename your horse. As you progress, you unlock more care actions like grooming or spending private time with your horse. Its interesting training for and entering competitions. If only getting more horses didn't cost so much!<br />I really like my horse Rose. I'm not really a horse fanatic or anything, but I still REALLY love this amazing game! Its probably as close as I'll ever get to owning an actual horse. Hopefully there are loads of levels on this game because I don't ever want to stop playing! I highly suggest this game. Overall, this game has fantastic graphics, fun challenges, and is a lot like owning a real horse. Come on now, press that button and start playing My Horse!
071563318X|5.0|Like I said, it's a fun read for zombie fanatics. I bought it as a gag gift and he loved it.
B001JIFYSA|4.0|Good girly flick, wife really likes this one so I decided to watch it with her and wasn't dissappointed at all.
B0076DELIG|5.0|I'm a Michael Connelly fan and I love Harry Bosch books. This is really a good read. You will find it hard to put down.
B002BI6SMI|5.0|What else can I say?  This has to be one of the top action movies I've seen.  Just bought Taken 2 and can't wait to watch it over and over again!
1936608898|5.0|Love this book...it has changed my life. The recipes are fantastic and easy to prepare and explained well. I've lost weight effortlessly and actually look forward to cooking everyday.
B008RZF2I0|5.0|Sometimes changing band members can be a band killer especially when that member is an iconic singer like Khan and such a principle part of the song writing. I thought Tommy should have been the full time singer the entire Poetry for the Poisoned Tour and not just singing a few songs a show because his voice is amazing. Sometimes you'll hear Tommy trying to imitate Khan a bit, but for the most part he sings the songs in his own style which fits the band perfectly. If you want to hear Kamelot sound exactly like Kamelot has on other albums then you may not like it especially if you like Kamelot because of Khan. If you like Kamelot because of the mood and feel of their style of music then this album won't disappoint. It is pretty dark at times with alot of orchetration and keys (you can tell Oliver was really involved in the writing process on this one). Overall it is one of my favorite Kamelot albums and it has been in heavy, heavy rotation.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|I can never go wrong with any of Ken Follett books, he never disappoints, looking forward to his next book of that trilogy!
B0049J0DC8|1.0|Not worth the $1.99 to stream the movie it started out grainy and by the end was almost unwatchable.  This was not an issue with my home internet I watched many moives streamed and this is the first time I have had this issue.  I also looked and I could stream other videos with good quality this one just sucked.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|When I started reading the book I thought...ugh this is for a younger (teen to early 20's) girl kind of book.  As I got a little further into it I could not put it down.  Very good book.  Make sure you have a box of tissues!
0743289692|5.0|This book is written by a young woman who lived under Islamic rules in Somalia, Saudi Arabia, Kenya, and the Netherlands.  I thoroughly enjoyed the insights presented regarding the place of women under Islam and her thoughts on how Islam is holding the Middle East back from enjoying the freedoms and rights that those of us in the West take for granted.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|At first I thought the story is just a superficial romantic story with a highly unlikely, funny, silly story line.  However, towards the end, the book  had much more depth and expressed the characters inner struggles to really trust fully and move beyond the hurt of the past.
B005LAIGN2|5.0|As a lover of black history, the movie brought out something in me. Has a place in my collection of movies
B002RI9HUM|3.0|Rachel's Holiday .Not what I was expecting, but only half way through the book, so hopefully it may improve. I can't believe that she can be so naive!
B005LAIGYQ|3.0|Clint Eastwood is one of the most recognisable actor and director. His stories are tough and gritty.. This might not be one of his best, but still worth enjoyable.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I waited and waited for it to come out free for kindle fire finally I got it free awesome you should get it if is really awesome and it is free and better than ever
B001UTW7QU|5.0|Makes a lot more sense when watched from the beginning. Very fun and enjoyable. Reminds me of the X-Files, but it's definitely not a copy.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This game is fun and is full of action it's  pretty great game if you like temple run 1 then you will like  temple run 2
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I love this game although it is a little slow at loading  i dont mind the wait. I have always loved horses and used to take care of some. The reason i like this game is because its like takin care of a horse agian the only thing i wish is that they let us chose a horse at the start instead of just givin us one right off of the bat.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|Great up for kindle fire shows you how much time left you have in a great way absolutely love it
B00577WFOU|5.0|This is a great live album. In many ways I prefer it over Made In Japan. The MK III line ups shines on this album. I really liked the setlist. Very heavy on the Burn album. Sound quality is excellent. If you're a fan of all eras of the band like me, this is a must own.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|I haven't read the litigator yet I will let you know after I read it I like John Grisham most of the time and him.  The racketeer was very good
B006S08RLU|5.0|We enjoyed the movie about overcoming fear and embracing life and its attendant messes immensely and found it life-affirming, lovely and charming.
1594203334|5.0|IMMO, the author has a bit too much idealized French upbringing. We are today all victms of a widespread globalisation. Fifty years ago, this might have still been true. The book is nevertheless interesting and gives some hints how we might do it differently.....
B00AQL8VU4|4.0|***UPDATE***<br />Installs fine now, helps me waste my money :)<br /><br />**ORIGINAL***<br />App cannot be installed on nexus 7 from Google play store because it claims to be incompatible, but can be installed just fine from amazon app store. Why make me jump through hoops to throw my money at you?<br /><br />Looks nice but not seeing much added functionality over original
B0040HO01Y|5.0|I enjoy period costume dramas--and this series did not disappoint!  Charming characters, setting, and plot draw you in to watch more episodes!
B002PEP4SC|4.0|I enjoyed it, was thinking of the show and decided I really like the show better.  But my new line is from the book\\" shut the front door\\"!
B00821OX98|5.0|I started watching it on a fluke and can't stop. I love the storyline and Noah Wyle is better than ever.
B0090P98Z4|4.0|I like this game. I find it very addicting and fun though I am not a game kind of person
B000002OX5|5.0|I just saw them do Quadrophenia + a lot of Who's next live. This was a \\"life event\\", at least musically. I saw them do Tommy live in 1969 or 1970, so full circle. I was so totally blown away that I've been playing their albums all week. I got the Who Sell Out vinyl in 1967 and it's been a favorite ever since. With the advent of CD's, I got this version. I have no complaints about stereo or missing content. The added tracks are a cherished gift. I especially like \\"Jaguar\\" which highlights Moon's unparalleled roaring drums. \\"It's a girl Mrs. Walker, it's a girl..\\" was a revelation.
B004J09ONG|5.0|I loved watching Elsa and her cubs. Born Free is an excelant movie for all ages.<br />I highly recomend watching this movie
B003K1EYM6|5.0|Works great.  I do lots of pictures and sometimes want to check out a few and this worked great.  Can take off some of the pics right off the camera.  And leave them on the card to remove when I get home to my larger computer.
B00A9V2JSG|5.0|I can't put into words how beautiful and moving this book is. I cried in the end, feeling Lena's anguish and I rarely cry reading books. If you're considering buying The Delirium, do it. You won't regret it
B008QE9XD2|4.0|As usual Johnny Depp was funny but this film kind of dissappointed me.  Was slow in places, funny in some, but didn't go the way I thought it would.  The end was wrong of course, but hey it's a movie.. but liked it to a point and didn't like it
B00A0NOF7G|2.0|The storyline of this book was way too predictable, words were misspelled...a disappointment. I don't really think this book was ready for publication.
B000V1Y43W|5.0|Was a gift for my grandson so have no idea lol, but he loved it and that is all that matters to me.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It is a cool game but it can be a little glitche sometime but other than that it's a really addicting and fun game.
B009G7ZYPY|5.0|I purchased for my husband for a stocking stuffer - and we listen to it frequently.  Beautiful voices combined with Susan to give you a great musical experience.  I love the song selection and the arrangements.  Not disappointed at all!  It's frequently the last CD I listen to at night.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|This game is a great game for increasing hand eye reflexes and for bragging how good you are at the game
0143121316|4.0|I read this book while living and working in China for a year and found it to be very helpful. Living in China has brought to mind the famous quote from the movie The Man who Shot Liberty Valance, \\"When the legend becomes fact print the legend.\\" I often found myself at odds when discussing Chinese history with my new Chinese friends and most of the time I just blamed this on there propaganda machine. But as with most things the truth is somewhere in between. This book helped me in learning about what has not only legend in China but what I had always thought to be true from the American side and was not as clear cut as I had always thought. Its obvious to me that there is no American diplomat that is better suited to write on this subject than Dr. Kissinger. When I talked with my new Chinese friends on this subject I often found that they felt the same, Dr. Kissinger's one of the most respected Americans politicians in history according to Chinese people. This book strengthened my ability to have enlightened and difficult conversations with my Chinese coworkers. Its a great read to better understand the Sino-American world I now live in.
B0031YJFCQ|3.0|As with the second book, there were several large sections in it that contributed nothing to the central plot or to character development. These sections seemed to present in the book to simply account for the passage of time. The braiding of the story elements was distracting and some narrative lines were unimportant. It seemed as if the book was not edited. Ironically the Swedish film version was better than the book, something that very seldom happens with film adaptations of books. For me this one is on the low end of three stars.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this is fun and addictive. my daughter loves horses so its fun to have her &quot;care&quot; for one whenever she wants!
B008HK3S9K|4.0|I have a sturdier case that I use when packing my Kindle Fire in the tote that I carry back and forth to work, but this Timbuk2 sleeve case is perfect for when I want to slip the Kindle Fire in my purse for a road trip or running errands.  It has a foam-lined interior and the outside is bright and a bit whimsical.  It gets a high recommendation from me!
0553582038|3.0|I ordered the book for my husband's B-Day.  I know it wasn't the sellers fault but he was supposed to have it by his B-Day but instead the shipped to my address not his.  We are serperated..  The book came and it was just as described and he got it a week late but loved it.  Now I am looking for the larger paperback copies of the first three I got him.. I would order from this person again.  Like I said not their fault that UPS can't seem to find my husband but the US mail can.  lol
B007THA4FI|4.0|I found the characters well-developed and the multiple plot lines kept my interest. Didn't predict the ending, so that's a plus.
B000MV9026|5.0|My kids really loved this movie I always wanted to get them this but at the price they have it in the store made it hard.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|So surprised that a seemingly easy game has kept my attention for days. It is now the middle of the night and I find it a way to relax yet feel challenged!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Heat game I would tots recommended this gr8 o anyone that LIKE s temple run and temple run 2 and mindcraft but t his game is surely amazing Dr bomb
B008AK8FHM|5.0|This is the very best &#34;Life After Death&#34; book I've ever seen - and I personally have had a similar experience.  Further, I gave a copy to a friend whose husband was recently murdered.  She found the journey Dr. Alexander described most comforting.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This is a heart pounding, blood churning game that should not be played at night before you go to bed.  The graphics are great and, with the sound affects, you really get into the feeling of trying to flee from the beast and getting around the obstacles without going into the brink of disaster.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I was traveling and trying to do some calculations on my laptop.  It drove me crazy.  Sure was glad I thought to add this to my tablet.  It saved me hours of work and frustration.
B004XUMMFE|5.0|I enjoyed the series enough to add it to my personal collection. Too bad it lasted only one season, I certainly would have liked to see more.
B00APJLEGA|5.0|Great movie. My daughter cannot stop watching it:-) must see!!! I would recommend for any age. I got a Hdmi cable for the Kindle Fire HD and watched it on my T.V. Well, worth it!
B005WUHAX8|3.0|Very upset with lifeproof... I have tried contacting them numerous times by email and phone.. Still no response, Call the 800-number and always get \\" all reps are busy please wait\\" waited up to 25 minutes and still no one comes to the phone.  My lifeproof screen is bubbled too much and I wanted to speak to them about it.  Took it to Radio Shack and the manager told me there that he had numerous questions about the air/bubble from the screen.  I do like the case just wondering about the screen.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|The only reason I said its ok is because it crashes! Try hitting the back button instead of play again every time. But if you are a true game person. then this is  for you!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is so cool I play it all the time and it couldo<br />n't be more fun I'm hooked on it did I say its awesome cuz it is REALLY awesome
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this is a great game. I highly recommend it! it is a game that all ages will enjoy. my horse is just a great game all around.
B007N85ZXY|4.0|Oh Susannah starts this CD out with a bang as Neil submits his versions of some of the most classic American folk songs ever made.  His version of Gallows Pole easily equals if not surpasses the Zeppelin version, and Get a Job is up there with any of the sounds Sha-Na-Na ever put together in any decade.  Clementine and Tom Dula were also very commendable selections to pull out of history and do a Neil treatment too, with Clementine almost being unrecognizable compared to the original versions.  Jesus Chariot is the pleasant surprise of the whole album as she is coming over the mountaain, and is rounded out with un unreal adaptation of God Save the Queen
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love pinterest!! I personally like the app better than online! It makes it easier to pin a lot of stuff! I love it! If you love pinterest, then you will love the pinterest app too!!
B008OTTSX4|5.0|This album really surprised me, and grew on me the more I listened to it.  The songs I knew I would love like Chicken Foot doing Highway Star with Joe Sat. smokin it! and Metaliicas version of When a Blind Man Cries which is perfectly played and so tight, were soon overshadowed by Black Label Society doing the somewhat obscure but always recognizable Pictures Of Home, and super cover of Lazy by Joe Bonamasa.  His playing is impeccable as always and Arlan Schierbaum nails the almost otherworldy keyboard sections.<br /><br />The Satana version of Smoke and Maiden version of Space Truckin are decent and the Glenn Hughes remake of Highway Star is well done, luckily since Steve Vai is rippin the ax parts.  The Flaming Lips version of Smoke is almost laughable, but overall I give this classic tribute album 4.5 out 5 stars.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|good story I like the puzzles make me think with out being to hard were it isn't fun.  this is my second app from G5 and I will buy more from them as long as the produce this type of quality.
B0081336FO|4.0|We enjoy watching this modernized version, but it just doesn't have the same allure as the Basil Rathbone versions in B&W.
140053271X|2.0|It was exchanged for one that worked.Problem with the first one connecting to internet. Took first one to Barnes & Noble and they worked with my son as it was a gift for him. Personally I love the Kindle.
B0067TQQI8|5.0|This charger is amazing.  I have a smartphone, a G'Zone Commando, and I use it a lot for horseback riding in the mountains.  I have an app that lets me download topo maps to my phone for use when there is no cell service and I also use the GPS feature to track our route and place us on the maps.  This means the map app as well as the GPS is running all the time and that would kill the battery after just a few hours.  The Anker will charge my smartphone three full times (with the phone battery at about 10%) and get a fourth partial charge.  This allows me to keep my tracker on all day and use the topo maps for hours at a time.  I also recently spent several days at my state capital for the General Assembly and while others who were with me were looking for plugs and having to stand there and wait to charge their phones, I was able to plug my phone to the Anker and stick them both in my purse and could keep moving.<br /><br />This is, hands down, one of the most useful things I've purchased from Amazon!
B004J4WLB4|4.0|This book presents the story of a victim of child abuse/neglect and a not too flattering look at the Foster Care system in which she grew up in. I felt it was exaggerated in the portrayal of the Foster Care system and the resulting animal-like behavior and refusal to communicate or socialize with other people on the part of the main character. Fortunately, flowers and some good people (yes, there are some) &#34;save&#34; her.
B003JVH7XU|4.0|great fight choreography. i would watch it again and again to watch the fight scenes and acrobatics.  the acting, is ok
B0050DIWFC|4.0|Any tme a child is murdered, it is disturbing. In its attempt to find the murderer, the book attempts to explore the possibility of a &#34;murder gene&#34;.  Interesting plot.
B004JZBGWI|5.0|i love it. this an excellent app. i bwill refer it my friends. note color is the best ever app
0061122416|1.0|A badly written (I had the displeasure of reading it in Portuguese) cheap philosophy for those who like easy readable books for the beach. Coelho is the most overrated author since mankind has discovered the written word.
B0053O89YM|5.0|Great series!  Really great to not have to watch or forward through all of the commercails!  It's worth the money!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is a really fun app for people who like playing temple run and other games where u have yo run and jump over things
B008MG1E4A|3.0|I thought the account was decent, and it was certainly interesting to read about what these SEALS go through.  Having said that, there is a lot of material on the topic, and this wasn't that much different.  The details of the operation to kill UBL were average in interest.  Many of the details were already disclosed/known.<br /><br />I generally liked the story, but then the author started taking a few digs at Obama.  And, whether it was Obama or Romney or whoever else could have been in power, I didn't think it was the appropriate forum.  Yes, politicians are often snakes, and they will manipulate a success such as this to their benefit.  However, on the flip side of the coin, if Obama hadn't said \\"yes,\\" then this wouldn't have happened.  And, if he said \\"yes\\" but the mission was a failure, he wouldn't have been re-elected.  So, he had skin in the game too, albeit in a different fashion.<br /><br />Anyway, the fact I have to bring that up speaks to the fact that this book veered from what its intended topic seemingly was.<br /><br />It does appear that the author has been 100% successful in his stated goal of raising money for charities--if that's what ends up happening with the money.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Love it! I think it's really well written and acted. Recommend to anyone that likes British showa and period dramas.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|Got a litttle weird towards the end, but still a good read.  Didn't buy it though, did the library thing.
B000FBFN1U|5.0|My favorite out of the series so far! You won't want to put it down. On to book four now!
B0011UJMK2|4.0|Some of it was difficult to follow but an intriguing story and I will follow the rest of it. Many interesting details of life and times in Russia during this period of history.
B0052AC8C6|4.0|I love watching these movies mainly because the animation is so amazing!  I thought this was a very cute movie.  I watch them with my grandchild.
B008DM4OTA|5.0|My 5 year olds first tried out the free edition of this app. They loved it so much I bought the full version and I'm so glad I did! This has kept them busy during long boring appointments.
B00005R2IS|5.0|Bought this for christmas for my dad.  Great picture and sound.  The originial actors voices rather than the stupid &#34;Speed Racer&#34; style American voice overs because apparently they thought we wouldn't be able to understand Australian accents.  There's even a behind the scenes section which is very in depth.
B008K6HN8I|4.0|Does exactly what it says it will do, works great. No problems with it at all.  I would recommend this app.
B0044DEAUA|5.0|Saved me the first day i used it from a cellphone ticket.  loud,clear, and charge lasts a very long time
B004SD5GZ4|4.0|Works as expected.  There is not much more to say, it does it's job as Adobe Reader should. Good Job
B002G1YPH0|5.0|Overclocked my 3.2GHz Phenom II to 4.2GHz and this keeps it under 50ºC even while gaming. I have added a second Cooler Master 120mm fan for the push-pull option and it's still super quiet. Awesome product, I would recommend for anyone with a tower that can hold it.
B00596WEVI|4.0|These two action powerhouses colliding should have been an awesome film. But action wise it was just entertaining not great.<br />I mean the two of these guys had a better fight in The Shepherd:Border Patrol. There was barely any martial arts in this one, I mean their fight was them bumping into each other which was kind of a let down. However I actually enjoyed the rest of the film. This was a nice little action thriller with another good performance by mr. Damme. Recommended if you like action thrillers.
B00APJLFEG|5.0|It was a great movie. Great characters and the kids loved it. Great that there was no harsh violence or language.
B0099KJFJ4|3.0|This film was definently inspired by Yojimbo! However the story was told in away that felt kind of like a train wreck. It's a shame<br />because the fights are fun and we get another good performance by mister Damme who only has a few scenes in this film. If the story was alot easier to follow then I would have given this 4 stars. But I have seen alot worse straight to video fight films. So watch it if you love Cung Le or if its on for free.
B005RUUUAI|5.0|awesome show, very dark and scary! will people ever stop going to see what that noise was??? But for someone who doesn't like scary movies, I love this show!
B00A2LOAKI|5.0|The DC Universe animated films are a hit or miss with me. But Parts one and two of the Dark Knight returns is by far their best work. Both parts were amazing! It was as close your gonna get to the orginal comic material, great action, great score, great voice over work, non-generic animation, and above all a great story. Dark and Violent the way this Frank Miller story should be told! I dont see DC animation topping this one for a long time. Highly recommended!
B0034G4OXQ|3.0|back of clear plastic cover, shiny info sheet and black plastic box were sliced through---no damage to disc, but very unsightly for the library
B00AREIAI8|5.0|it has very good animation and is fun. you get to do all of these things, but it will never be like taking care of a real horse. for people who can't have a horse, this app is perfect!
B00B2V66VS|3.0|Love the game and new features.  However, I have three kindle fires that freeze up , uninstalled and reinstalled with no succes.  No problems with galaxy sIII or Fire HD.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|cool great awesome<br />woo woo woo woo woo<br />woo woo woo woo woo woo woo woo woo woo woo woo woo woowoo wooing woo
