B00C5W3SBE|1.0|Can't believe they didn't include the 3d copy! I guess my library will be without this movie, how does Disney expect an average household to shell out more than $60 bucks to own both the 2d and 3d. If this is a new trend we are going to be renting from redox more often than buying!

B009FZHYKU|5.0|Although season three is more brutal and &#34;gritty&#34; than the previous seasons, I still can't stop watching! You never know what is going to happen or who is going to die!

B000099T3P|4.0|If one monster is a good thing, consider dozens of small pincushion roly-poly monsters from outer space.  They maybe small but they've got large appetites.  Basically, they're just eating machines always in search of a snack.  Having escaped from a prison asteroid, the Krites (Crites) or Critters, head straight for Earth and land near the rural home of the Browns (Dee Wallace-Stone, Billy Green Bush, Nadine Van der Velde, and Scott Grimes), where they immediately start to snack.  As luck would have it, a pair of gun happy bounty hunters show up to contain the menace (they shoot everything in sight).<br />Described as a Sci-fi/horror comedy, Critters is a strange hybrid in that it really doesn't stay still long enough to be classified as any one thing.  It's not funny enough to be a comedy, doesn't have enough horror elements to make it scary, and is far too earthbound to be Sci-fi.  Instead, it's a perversely sly set piece of mayhem.  On one hand, you have a family trapped in their home by a pack of marauding critters.  On the other hand, you have two incompetent bounty hunters taking forever to locate their prey.  Not everyone makes it out alive.<br />I thought this was a fun movie the first time I watched it.  I still think it's a fun movie.  And although a few too many people delight in calling this a Gremlins rip-off, director Stephen Herek swears Critters was written well before Gremlins even went into production.  Personally, I don't see any comparison whatsoever.

1452115567|5.0|I first learned about the amazing Maddie after reading a newspaper article about her travels throughout the U.S.  She has an amazing sense of balance and always seems to be smiling in the photos.  Likewise, it makes me smile to view the many creative images in this book.  If you've ever adopted a shelter or rescue dog, you'll be inspired by Maddie's spirit and how her owner, Theron Humphrey, tells the story of their travels through beautiful photographs.

B00CDT41RY|4.0|Like most of his movies, Tarantino's Django Unchained provides some of the bloodiest humor available outside zombie films. The blood spurts and gore are so over the top as to elicit frequent (still surprised) laughter. The characters are interesting, although only superficially developed and stereotypical. Samuel Jackson's character offers some surprises. And, Jamie Foxx plays his with intensity and no comedy. It is entertaining.
B00123LIPK|5.0|Awesome music. Definitely recommend to friends. You won't be disappointed. Great album.<br />It contains most of her hits from the 90's you can't go wrong. Buy it. Specially for the price.

B00571F26Y|2.0|I have read the book and was very much disappointed. Although it is full of knowledge about wheat and why we should eat less of it, I believe the conclusion that americans are getting fat because of wheat is really too simplistic. It says in the book that 99% of the wheat consumed worldwide is the new kind of modified wheat.<br />How come that americans are getting so fat and not the french who are eating white bread and fatty croissants for breakfast?? What with the rest of Europe? The mediterranean countries?<br />I live in Turkey and this is a country where white bread and rice constitutes a big portion of peoples diet. You won't see obese people on the streets, some are a bit chubby meaning they are overweight by 10 to max 30 pounds. I observe that children in the big cities who eat fast food, sweats and chocolates  are fatter than the children on the country who consume the same bread and rice and pasta less the sweats, junk food and coke!!<br /><br />so let us be honest:  while eliminating wheat can be good for a lot of people with wheat allergys, this is not the only reason why americans are getting fat. Europeans are always suprised about sizes xxl and bigger that virtually do not exist in other countries of the world. And about the huge serving sizes  and the junk food (not real food) that americans eat: almost no vegetables or fruits, instead lots of coke, fries, bagels, donughts, pizza, etc - all these are high in glycemic index. Limitation is the essence: eat more veggies and fruits, eliminate sodas and sweats and moderate wheat products and you will lose it.
B009G8GRX6|3.0|I only bought this because it was on sale. I admit to being brainwashed into liking the 1st single from this album and given that I paid roughly the same amount as buying only the single I can't complain too much, had I paid more I would have been very disappointed.<br />There are a few stand out tracks but I find the album lacks a cohesive arc to it, let me rephrase that: if you put the album tracks on random play, one would scarcely notice an alteration.<br />So in short, this album suffers from the modern &#34;singles only&#34; affliction.<br />I do wonder how much creative control this excessively produced band had over this album.<br />If you pay more than $5 for this album you got ripped off.<br />Thanks,<br />-old man
B003E6LC6I|5.0|This is a good follow up to Season 1. Questions still remain around who killed Ellen's fiance and just how dark Patty really is (no comment). The writers do a good job keeping the storyline flowing even while using the exact same story arc as Season 1.
0140120416|2.0|I am a native English speaker married to a Native Russian speaker. My husband has spoken English for 12 years and he attended college in the U.S. he has an extensive English vocabulary (I have been reading at a college level since I was 12 and he comes up with \\"ACT words\\" that I don't know). He has maxed the government fluency exams for both Russian and Ukrainian.<br /><br />I have studied a couple romance languages in the past and I typically have easily met the expectations of the language learning programs I was using whether or not meeting the goals were effective at steering me towards fluency.<br /><br />So what I am trying to say is we are both disciplined and motivated students and have studied languages successfully before. And that he is obviously qualified to help me learn Russian.<br /><br />My husband probably speaks Russian at least 5 days a week while I am in earshot (calling his family, speaking to the dog etc.) but it took me 2 years to start hearing words instead of just sounds (something I never struggled with in Latin Romance Languages). The words in Russian are often very unfamiliar to native English speakers this is a challenging language for English speakers.<br /><br />I have bought a few different books about Russian and we both dislike the idea or learning Russian using transliteration (what good does it do to be able to speak some Russian if you can't read a map, street sign or even a menu?).<br /><br />The biggest issue with starting to learn Russian is learning Cyrillic....easier said then done. I studied flashcards and he also drilled me on them for a total of 30-60 minutes a day for 10-14 days and I only memorized 1/3 the alphabet (brute memorization is also something I usually do fairly easily with flashcards). This book starts teaching you to read basic words immediately as if the alphabet was not hard enough, I found this very overwhelming as a beginner.<br /><br />I do think this book would be a good reference but I would only recommend this book for ADVANCED beginners (what most people call Intermediate). My husband liked the content and layout when he was reviewing resources to help me learn Russian but he did say some of the things they were saying didn't make sense because they were trying to force phases so early from so little vocabulary. These little awkward phrases only served to further confuse me since they usually combined the few things I thought I had understood and suddenly they no longer made sense (even to my husband). The chapters are so short and packed it reads more like a study aid (cliff or spark notes) than an actual language learning text.<br /><br />I would NOT recommend this for true beginners or self-study purposes. But I think for more experienced Russian students with more resources it would be a good reference or review for people that have spoken Russian (well) in the past but need a quick refresher course. I also did not like the font the type was tiny and somewhat blurry which is grating when you are studying for any extended amount of time.

0743297334|5.0|I read \\"The Sun Also Rises\\" after reading \\"A Moveable Feast,\\" Hemingway's amazing factual account of his expatriate years in Paris with his \\"Paris Wife\\" Hadley, F. Scott and Zelda Fitzgerald, Ezra Pound, James Joyce, Gertrude Stein, and other members of the post-WWI \\"Lost Generation.\\" \\"The Sun Also Rises\\" is a novelization based on this Paris caf&eacute; society as well as on Hemingway's 1925 trip to Spain. It is an astonishing, riveting book. It is hard to believe that Hemingway wrote the first draft in two months, and that it was published when he was only 27 years old.<br /><br />Jake Barnes is the narrator of the book, a working journalist with friends in the \\"Lost Generation\\" caf&eacute; society of Paris during the jazz age of the Roaring 20's. Jake suffered an unspecified wound during the Great War, rendering him impotent. Jake's true love is Lady Brett Ashley, a thoroughly modern woman who has been through two divorces and now has a new fianc&eacute;, Mike. Robert Cohn, a Jewish boxer and Bill Gorton, a novelist, round out the group of friends. They decide to attend the Festival of San Ferm&iacute;n in Pamplona, Spain and witness the \\"running of the bulls\\" and bullfighting firsthand. Cohn, who had an affair with Brett, is unable to contain his jealousy and the group slowly disintegrates.<br /><br />The bullfighting scenes are breathtaking. Brett falls for the young matador Romero, and we see and learn to appreciate his artistry in the bull ring. The matador faces the existential nothingness in the charge of the bull, and puts down death with the thrust of his sword. Hemingway effectively contrasts the authenticity (living life fully) of bullfighting and of the working man (Jake), who continually pays the bills, with the inauthentic expatriates of the time living on inherited money. \\"Nobody ever lives their life all the way up except bull-fighters.\\"<br /><br />In the terrific middle section of the book, which serves as a kind of interlude between The Paris and Pamplona sections, Jake and Bill go on a fishing trip in Spain. The bus trip with the Basques and the spare descriptions of the days at the river and the beautiful scenery is therapeutic for Jake and simply glows for the reader. It is all about the redemptive power of nature and is a rebirth of sorts for the two after the debauchery of Paris, after the horrors of war, and as \\"men without women.\\"<br /><br />Hemingway always tried to write truthfully, and the book contains many quotes that stood out to me.  Jake says, \\"It is awfully easy to be hard-boiled about everything in the daytime, but at night it is another thing.\\" An elderly gentleman called The Count observes, \\"It is because I have lived very much that now I can enjoy everything so well. That is the secret. You must get to know the values.\\" Also, when Brett talks about Mike she says, \\"He's so damned nice, and he's so awful. He's my sort of thing.\\"<br /><br />Interestingly, the novel is a roman &agrave; clef, meaning that the characters and action are based on ones in the real world. Hemingway and his wife visited the festival in Pamplona for a third time in 1925 and took with them Hemingway's boyhood friend Bill Smith, Donald Ogden Stewart, Lady Duff Twysden (recently divorced), her lover Pat Guthrie, and Harold Loeb. \\"In Pamplona the group quickly disintegrated. Hemingway, attracted to Lady Duff, was jealous of Loeb, who had recently been on a romantic getaway with her; by the end of the week the two men had a public fistfight. Against this background was the influence of the young matador from Ronda, Cayetano Ord&oacute;&ntilde;ez, whose brilliance in the bullring affected the spectators. Ord&oacute;&ntilde;ez honored Hemingway's wife Hadley by presenting her, from the bullring, with the ear of a bull he killed. Outside of Pamplona, the fishing trip to the Irati River (near Burguete in Navarre) was marred by polluted water. Hemingway intended to write a non-fiction book about bullfighting but thought thatthe week's experiences had presented him with enough material for a novel.\\" Wikipedia contributors. \\"The Sun Also Rises.\\" Wikipedia, The Free Encyclopedia. Wikipedia, The Free Encyclopedia, 4 Apr. 2013. Web. 24 Apr. 2013.<br /><br />\\"The Sun Also Rises\\" is a masterpiece from Hemingway. He doesn't flinch from painful truths and trusts the reader to invest himself fully by filling in the blanks of his surgically precise prose. I think that \\"A Moveable Feast\\" is an excellent companion volume, giving the reader much factual background and \\"feel\\" for Hemingway's Paris years and insight into his writing process at that time. Characters from \\"The Sun Also Rises\\" leap off the page, peerlessly characterizing the \\"Lost Generation\\" between WWI and the Great Depression. Brett and Jake will stay with you always. \\"Isn't it pretty to think so.\\" Very highly recommended.aterial for a novel.\\" Wikipedia contributors. \\"The Sun Also Rises.\\" Wikipedia, The Free Encyclopedia.

B001B7CNXI|3.0|The film itself isn't so bad. I did some reading and research on the making of the movie only to find out that people, for the most part, dislike Michael Mann because of the way he directs a film. He is described as rude and demeaning and will talk down to most of the crew, including the actors. I understand that the movie is his baby and he wants the best for it. It still doesn't excuse his behavior.<br /><br />Apparently, Jamie Foxx was also hard to work with as he was labeled as a crybaby. Turns out throughout shooting, he would refuse to do scenes if they were on boats or on airplanes. He apparently has a fear of these things, but when you sign onto a movie like this, you are told what is going to go down from the start so if you can't hack it, step aside. Foxx also demanded (and got) more money than Colin Farrell or else he wouldn't do the film. He refused to take commercial flights so the studio had to charter a plane for him whenever they changed locations. To top it all off, he demanded he get top billing over Ferrell. Sigh. I think Foxx is a fine actor, but he sure is a diva.<br /><br />Ferrell, for the most part, was apparently a pleasure to work with. Most of the crew said he still liked to joke around here and there, but when it came to getting scenes done, he was very professional and easy going.<br /><br />One thing that shows through the film is that Michael Mann kept doing rewrites. It's not unusual to change a couple of things here and there, but at times Mann would change things the same day so the crew would have to secure things like boats, cars, even reportedly having to close down a highway in a single day because Mann continuously changed his mind. The story in the movie is cohesive, but barely. Even watching the film it feels like as soon as they start getting into a character's development, the pull the rug out from under them. A lot of the dialog sounds contrived and doesn't feel like it was meant to be said. Gong Li had to learn her lines phonetically and it shows from time to time. I really liked her performance though so I can't hate on her too much. She was believable. In the Director's Cut, you get to see more of her character and how she came to be involved in her current circumstances. Her chemistry with Ferrell was good and I am glad they focused on Sonny and Isabella's relationship as much as they did.<br /><br />A lot of people say this movie has no real plot, but it does. The problem is, again, all the changes that Mann implemented as they went along. The plot is weak, but it's there. If you miss even one piece of information, you are likely to get confused so you have to really pay attention.<br /><br />Some of the subtle nuances were nice and added to the movie. One thing Mann definitely got right was making sure we noticed certain things like the weather in the background of several scenes. The sounds of the gunfire was spot on and didn't sound manufactured.<br /><br />As far as the transfer to Blu Ray, I wasn't all that happy with it. I have this movie on DVD as well and I thought it played pretty nice. I got the Blu Ray because I thought the action was good and I wanted to see how they could improve things. The biggest issue I have is that some of the scenes show far too much grain. I don't mind a little grain as it feels more genuine. However, some of the scenes, especially during the night, were so grainy it was difficult to make out objects and, at times, facial expressions. I'm not sure if this is what Mann was going for when he shot those scenes, but it got annoying. The sound is alright, but not perfect. A pet peeve of mine is having to constantly adjust the volume when watching a film. I hate it when dialog is so low I have to crank my television up to 35 just to hear it. I then have to lower it back down to 20 when an action scene comes up because it gets far too loud.<br /><br />3.3 / 5phonetically and it shows from time to time.

B005GFPZYK|5.0|A great Texan and Great American Hero. The book gives a great insight into war and life, good and evil.
B001NHNG64|3.0|Pretty predictable plot line, and somewhat tiresome if you've read one or more of the Reacher books in the past.  Also, the author's syntax is repeticious and clearly reflects origin other than American.  That's not a problem per se but is bothersome given the nature of the protaganist and the location of the story.
0385344228|5.0|I loved reading this book. This is a great read for someone who loves shows like Law & Order or murder mysteries! I definitely couldn't put this book down and I'm excited to read other books by this author.
B001O1O71C|4.0|Beautifully executed piece of writing.  Coming from a child's point of view and level of sophistication gives the story a heightened impact and gives the reader greater perspective of the what the Nazi and concentration camp experience were like.
1401941893|5.0|I am glad to say that beauty truly in not just skin deep.  Miranda Kerr, Victoria Secret Angel supermodel, wrote her first book \\"Treasure Yourself\\".  Miranda has enrolled women she knows in her personal life to each draw flower illustrations for her book.  Each woman gets her name inscribed next to the flower they drew.  Miranda divided book into two parts.  In the first part she talks about her life and career and gives wise advice to (young) women how to nurture their bodies, take care of their souls and cherish people in their lives.  Stories are hearfelt and I am amazed how much wisdom Miranda has.  She is not even thirty years old and her life has tought her how to handle most difficult situations.<br /><br />In the middle of the book are sample photos of Miranda and her family while she was growing up.  There are also pictures of her modeling for some of the most famous fashion designers in the world.<br /><br />The second part of the book has pictures of butterflies (which I love - I always loved these magnificent creatures) and inspirational affirmations.  The best part is that these affirmations will increase self esteem of any human being.  I keep it on my desk and sometimes flip the page and use the affirmation throughout the day.<br /><br />Finally, Miranda uses the book to also announce to her audience charities she support and to promote KORA her organic skin care company that uses noni (tahitian fruit) as the main ingredient for the skin care line that is making its name in Australia.<br /><br />Miranda is an amazing person.  I am glad she wrote this book.  It is inspirational and it shows every woman how to best respect our body and soul.

B003O86FMW|5.0|My favorite book book I read it in about 4 hours the ending will shock you!!! You can really see the relationship between Katniss and Peeta grow and flourish also for Team Gale fans there is a lot more of Katniss' feelings for him and the love triangle forms. I love this book and I hope you will too!! Team Peeta!!!!!
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|The Room is one of the most visually stunning and cleverly designed puzzle game that I have had the pleasure of playing. Its puzzles are well designed and fun to solve, and more than once I was shocked by the results of the answer. I recommend this game to anyone with a love of riddles, and look forward to the next game.
B000H4TX9I|5.0|I stumbled on this show when I was feeling sick, and needed something to pass the time.  I am so glad that I did!  I truly wish that there was a season 2...and beyond!
B0019O6IWU|5.0|Enlightening and will completely change you into that better person you want to be.  I know it has made me look at everything in a completely different light.<br /><br />I purchased the book and the tapes. I recommend purchasing both.<br />Please note that they are very similar in context but also very different in delivery.  Each has a different affect on how you absorb the importance of the message.
B0072KZ0Z6|5.0|Chose this rating be because the DVD was in brand new condition as advertised and a great show would certainly recommend it
B004I744AS|5.0|I find theFreeDictionary to be user friendly and accurate. I use it all the time. I installed it on my smart phone, and my tablet.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|Great download for My Kindle.  Everywhere I go I have quick and easy access to the technologies I need.  Facebook is a MUST for the on the go Great Grandmothers out there.
B000IYU9IG|5.0|This is a great version, and way better quality than any other version I've seen. Funny movie, its a family favorite
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This app is so much fun to play. I have horses of my own and the tasks are relatable. I wish they had competitions that were beyond jumping I.e. dressage.
B00BLCHZC2|5.0|I've not been so hooked on a TV series since Spartacus. Only bad thing I have to say is the series season is too short.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Excellent ending to a powerful trilogy! Clung to every word until the very end! Never could have imagined how this would turn out. Loved every minute of it!
0316066524|1.0|I needed a long book for a long airplane ride and had high hopes that this book would see me through, and then some. Luckily I started reading Infinite Jest before lugging it onto the plane. Pretentious, boring, arrogant, ludicrous--the outpourings of an overprivileged overeducated white guy (no other category of person would attempt this con or be taken seriously for doing so). Some of the one star reviews are really witty and sharp, so read them instead of this book. To compare Wallace to Proust (as Dave Eggers does in the Foreword) is an absolute travesty. I picked the book up at our library's collection of paperback \\"return anytime\\" books, so at least there was no financial impact. I will try some of Wallace's essays because maybe this is the worst thing he ever wrote.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I apprehensively started watching the show after hearing about it from coworkers. I really became addicted! The show has all the drama and intrigue to convince you That you haven't quite enough of it yet.  Of course, one can't get enough of the clothing either.<br /><br />I can't wait for the next season to come out! I'll definitely be watching.
B00C1BV9Z6|5.0|A lot of sci-fi movies show their age, both with the technology used and the science referenced as the backdrop for the story.  However, for a movie that is coming up on 20 years Jurassic Park still delivers.  True, it's typical Spielberg in that you don't really know if it's a kids' movie or a sci-fi horror show, but he still manages to bring out the joy of the movie experience that makes many of his movies so fun to watch.
B004YM6JI2|5.0|I enjoy watching Supernatural. In fact, I have become obsessed with this show. My husband and I purchased the first 5 seasons at a different store and bought seasons 6 and 7 on Amazon. The show is addicting and has awesome twists and turns to the story line. We are almost finished with Season 7 and will be purchasing season 8 soon so we can catch up before the new season starts.
B00BYH6OJO|1.0|Great actors, decent previews.  What could go wrong?  This movie slogs along and never gets going.  Disjointed, anti-climatic, well you get the picture.  It was so boring my mind was more interested in the art on our wall than the movie at the end.  What a wast of actors I usually love to watch.
B000ZM7VVO|5.0|How can you not love Flogging Molly? I bought this and downloaded it to my phone. I have two toddlers and they enjoy rocking out to it too!
B008DKBQMK|5.0|I know this cover is made for a Kindle Fire, but I purchased it for my Google Nexus tablet. It's a perfect fit for the tablet and provides a good amount of protection (I dropped the tablet on the wood floor while in this case and nothing horrible befell it). The velcro seems to be of reasonably high quality as well, so I imagine the case will hold up over time. Here's a tip though: don't let the case get wet...the water will definitely seep through and soak whatever it is you're protecting (I know, my poor tablet has suffered a lot).
B00APUYWYA|5.0|This movie is hilarious. After renting it on Amazon I bought it and cannot stop watching. Definitely a movie to see!
B00CAJMGDI|5.0|Great music to energize your day. Lindsey has a style all her own and an abundance of talent that she shares with the world.
B001AQO3WY|5.0|I bought this as a gift for my husband. As a Marine he definitely appreciates this show. He is definitely entertained.
B00BQPEIT2|3.0|I love the graphics in this game but there's not enough action. Running all the time and not having to fight anyone is boring.
B003L77GGK|5.0|I enjoy watching Supernatural. In fact, I have become obsessed with this show. My husband and I purchased the first 5 seasons at a different store and bought seasons 6 and 7 on Amazon. The show is addicting and has awesome twists and turns to the story line.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|Besides this app being free I think it's a great game because it's really challenging. It's not just a typical matching game , it also helps with memory. Two thumbs up!
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Similar in style to myst or riven with a 3d interface. Took me two to three evenings to beat without hints. The artwork, animation, and creative machinery give the game stunning visuals. Highly recommended!
B00BEZTMQ8|4.0|Not a bad film, but a bit disappointing that it doesn't follow the book & in places it seems rushed into trying to fit in the story without explaining the plot. But overall very enjoyable & looking forward to the next one.
B0031RS7A4|5.0|Of all the books In the series, this is one of the best.<br /><br />The general structure is similar to others stories, but the situations created are, very often, very funny.<br /><br />I certainly recommend this one.
B00006FDCD|5.0|Stephen king is the master. I love all Stephen ki8ng movies and books.nobody does it better.he knows how to intrique.
B0009U5DD0|5.0|I bought it as a gift for my father. He loves it! The album has many of theit most famous songs.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love it is fun and challenging.subway surfers is one of the games I love.I love it so  much!!!!it is a fun app
B00BP4WAZS|5.0|This was  a great movie. I was pretty surprised at how involved the plot was. Very imaginative and really held my interest.
B004W1GCQO|5.0|This show is amazing.  I'm only sad that there are only 2 seasons.  If they brought this show back I would definitely watch.  This show does justice to the original Upstairs Downstairs!
B00APUYWYA|2.0|If I hadn't paid for it, I would have turned it off. The acting was poor, the plot was superficial. There was some good musical performances, however.
B00BETX5PS|5.0|Best 007 yet.  Bardan outdid the Joker.  Dench (M) was sensational.  Craig &#34;owns&#34; James Bond name. Great way to spend two hours.&#34;
B007N85ZXY|5.0|The tunes are classic selections from the American songbook.  I sang these in grade school, and you probably did too.  But they never sounded like this in music class!  This is a must have album for anyone who cares about the American dream's soundtrack. Or simply wants to enjoy rockin' good music.<br /><br />Back in the day, these song may have been sung a cappella or accompanied by a few friends' acoustic instruments. And people danced and shared their stories.  Neil Young & Crazy Horse keep the tradition.  But make no mistake, this album rocks!<br /><br />The classic-rock interpretation from the band proves these songs are timeless.  Like the tube amps the band used during the studio recording. I bought this album on digital, but am gifting it to my best friends on analog.  Probably should get myself the LP too.  It's that good.
B00BEPVAV8|1.0|Total waste of time.....especially for young children. My daughter, who normally does quite well with similar games, could not get anywhere with this mess. After I spent 10 minutes, I gave up and uninstalled it.
B009KS4XRO|3.0|REALLY LIKE THE GAME BUT MUST HAVE LOTS OF BINGO FRIENDS TO SEND FREE CREDITS, POWER UPS, AND KEYS TO PLAY IT FOR LONG.  ALSO, THE ADDED ROOMS JUST KEEP GETTING MORE AND MORE EXPENSIVE WITH CREDITS WHICH DISCOURAGES ME FROM WANTING TO PLAY IN THEM.  EVERY TIME THEY ADD A ROOM THEY INCREASE THE NUMBER OF CREDITS YOU NEED TO USE TO PLAY IN IT.  THERE REALLY OUGHT TO BE A LIMIT ON THE CREDITS CHARGED.  COLLECTNG GAME PIECES IS NEARLY IMPOSSIBLE TO DO.  IF IT WASN't for friends sending you their multiples you would never get anywhere.  They need to increase the number of credits that you can accept per day from friends.  I only play my free and gifted credits.  Also,the tournament should be limited to the original five rounds for tournament standings.  Some people purchase multiple extra rounds to pump up their scores which makes it unfair to those who.can only play the five original rounds.  Otherwise, except for losing the server every now and then it is an enjoyable game.
B0064MPXFA|3.0|I liked the beginning.<br />A women who is trying to find herself.<br />When she finds herself in the most unthinkable circumstances.<br />There were some places in this show, that made me fill uncomfortable.<br />The content is definitely adult.
030758836X|4.0|I was within a few pages of calling it quits when the book finally took off.  Then I couldn't quit if I wanted to.  I'll read all she writes.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|James is a talented writer. The story is gripping, beautifully conceptualized, and the erotica is well done. Not an easy task. I am hooked. Ready for number three.
B0002IQHY8|5.0|This is an Alan Parsons Project release that my wife and I were unfamiliar with, so when we learned about it we jumped at the opportunity to purchase it and we're not disappointed. It contains the usual moody tone, superlative musicianship and compelling lyrics. The inclusion of some techno influences makes it even more interesting.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Great book, page turner, keeps you intrigued, on your seat and cheering  for the characters.  I cannot wait for the final book.  Well done Suzane Collins.
B009M4KTEM|5.0|This is a variation of Jerry's solo career that I've not heard before. The arrangements on some of the songs were unfamiliar to me as are some of the band members. As always, Jerry's guitar playing is superlative and his backing band is excellent. Great listening throughout!
B0011UJMK2|4.0|Among the twists and turns the rich history with expose's on the Stalin, post-stalin era living, I could not stop reading.  The characters were rich and their emotions realistic.  Good who-dun-it.  Will recommend.
B00AO7HQ06|5.0|This long awaited Duane Allman collection was worth waiting for. It is a comprehensive overview of his entire recording career. It includes rarities that have never been released before. The sound quality is excellent and the liner notes and essays are insightful. My only complaint is that it could have included more unreleased live Allman Brothers tracks with Duane rather than the studio versions that have been available for decades. That's just a minor issue though.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I just became absorbed in the story and characters, rich involving even with their own language.  Couldn't put the book down.  Read it all in one sitting.  Cannot wait for the next two books.
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|I love littlest pet shop I have at least 100 pet shop stuff not counting my t-shirts and stuffed toys love the new lps love Hasbro I love the tiger that is white and orange.
B0027MJU00|5.0|Gillian Flynn brings a story rich in mood and atmosphere, down to earth language that piece through the sub-conscious that ensares you into the story.  Brillian, clever, fast-paced, and the twists and turns will boggle your mind.  Well crafted that I will surely read again and again.
B009KY5OGC|5.0|Bought this as a gift for my husband and he is totally hooked. He said it is excellent and well worth reading
B0094BB4TW|4.0|this is the way i keep in touch with family and friends that are out of town. would rec amend for anyone with family and friends out of town
B0071BGOJC|4.0|I'm enjoying this book. There is a very large cast of characters and its sometimes difficult to remember who is who. I bought this book on kindle but the paperback version has a cast of characters af the front which is useful to refer back to.<br />It is a big read
B0095P3ULC|5.0|Non stop action!!! A must see for everyone!!! Outstanding acting also!! Keeps you on the edge of your seat!! Enjoy!
B007ZXK08C|5.0|Excellent read. The suspense builds very expertly and I found it to be a page page turner. It is very well written and gripping and I have no problem recommending it to others
B0053FANRC|5.0|This  rating is  because of their great service!  I love the movie.  I will be using them again!  I will recommend them to other friends.
B00C0NFMKI|5.0|Great album. First listen was OK, but then I couldnt shut it off. Very different sound and feel. But it works!
B008K8VDPU|5.0|man this there app is good it just wants me to digaling in my pants toy know what. I'm saying its just so darn good it makes toy want to **** in your pants so *** awesome!!!!
B000000LZU|5.0|Beautiful old school gatefold sleeve album without shiny plastic foil and no bar code, like a double LP's from past times.<br />Very carefully packed, shipped on time. It was great pleasure play it again on my turntable (it directs me right to my younger days).
B0050DIWFC|5.0|Really loved this book & couldn't put it down from the start. This book kept you guessing until the end.
B006LKY1A8|5.0|This is an excellent movie.  The story is very engaging without six or violence.  Johnny Depp and Kate Wislet are perfect!
B00CDT41RY|3.0|It was A-OK, but I would never pay to watch it again. It is &#34;mind candy.&#34; If you have some time to kill, it will serve the purpose.
B0015DWJX2|5.0|someone recommended book to me when she heard we're traveling to Guernsey this June<br />great book  couldn't put it down  would recomment to others
B008220DGE|2.0|I'm afraid I didn't 'get' this movie. Slow, uneven and bewildering. Top-notch acting, I have no idea how they remembered their lines, the dialog seemed stilted and unnatural. Personally, could not recommend it.
B00AKS656U|5.0|Not too hard, not too easy.  Kids have really enjoyed this game and play it frequently.  Who doesn't love Garfield??
B004SIIBGU|5.0|My Granddaughter LOVES this, it is adroable and servicable at the same time. Highly recommend for any girl who loves Lalaloopsies!
B006G2124E|5.0|I read the book and was dying to see the movie. It's incredible to go back into our history and see this. It's sad but so amazing.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|best book I ever read ... it's even better than the movie ... more details on the events in the book
B00A2IUHM6|5.0|We've watched this movie about 5 times since we got it (we've had it for 2wks) and laugh so hard everytime. It has a moral which I never expected. A few parts are stupid but overall it's hilarious!
B001N3ELTO|4.0|A murderer is killing gay men in 1970's New York City and a young Al Pacino goes undercover to nab him.  It's a very good crime film, but that's not the best thing about this movie.  Viewers see the 70's in all its glory--hair, fashion,  gritty NYC before it was cleaned up by Rudy Giuliani.  Also, we get a view of gay life in a pre-HIV world complete with nudity and graphic sex. I suspect this was an X-rated film in 1979, and it's still shocking.  The video was very good, but the sound was bad.  No closed caption.  Someone with better hearing than me may not find the sound so bad.  All that Disco music blasting in my ears gave me hearing loss.
B000A59PMO|5.0|I bought Veronica Mars:  The Complete First Season due to all the buzz about the fan donations for a Veronica Mars movie and I was not disappointed.  Yes, it is cheesy but most shows on The WB/CW are cheesy.  Along side other crime solving series, the witty dialogue of Veronica Mars is refreshing and fun to watch.  I liked season one so much I bought seasons two and three.
B00BJS7104|5.0|I don't ususlly go for Tarantino movies, but my son made me watch it and I was surprised.  Loved it!
B008Y79HE6|3.0|Just a fun moive to watch ...it was an improvment for the old Godzilla movie I have seen in the past.
B009MYARIK|5.0|Quick, easy read. Laugh out loud funny! Really enjoyed it. Great beach or pool-side book. Will make a great movie!
0312380852|5.0|Excellent designs and ideas. I was looking for ways to integrate macrame into my bead collection. I love this book!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Great book. Keeps you at the edge of your seat and very interested. Hard to put down! Great story line cant wait to read the next book.
B0074YVW1G|2.0|How to make long a short story (and to make money of it). I've just read &#34;the power of habit&#34; and it is far better : you really learn how brains work.
B000I9YLTE|4.0|One of the funniest movies ever! John Belushi at his best. I saw it years ago...now itt's my grandkids' tiurn!
B005K17RU0|5.0|this app is so awesome to use and I love the radars that are up to date and so is the local forecast.
B009MYARIK|2.0|Being a HUGE Sophie fan, I couldn't wait to get my hands on this book. Unfortunately, it was a bit of a let down. The character of Lottie is supposed to be 33 years old. But honestly, she acts more like a flightly teenager. I found her character unlikeable, childish and moronic. The character of Ben is no better. I couldn't stand either one of them. I did like Fliss and Lorcan though. On the plus side, I did enjoy some laugh out loud moments that were pure Sophie. Sadly, those moments were few and far between and not enough to support the rest of the book. Hoping for better in the future.
B00B5HQL50|5.0|Craig really makes an interesting Bond and I can't get enough. It's a shame he got started so late in his life :(  I hope to see at least one more.
B00BHXUC8E|5.0|this is a real live double cds i didnt get to watch the dvd yet but the cds i cant stop playing in a time when real bands are hard to find its a great thing to have WhiteSnake alive and doing well and David vocals are still killers after all these years, get this album and rock on this is all that i can say \m/ ritchie blackmore didnt make a mistake when he had asked David to join ;)
B002LFPAUC|5.0|This is one of the funniest sitcoms I've  ever watched.  I wish they had more episodes!  This is my kind of absurd humor, same with the Blackadder series and Monty Python.  The price for the set was within my price range.  So now it's Mine, Mine, Mine!  I also put this with Absolutely Fabulous, or AbFab as it's affectionately referred to
0307120007|5.0|This was my toddler's favorite book. He was able to feel different textures on each page. I buy it for any new baby in my family. This is really a terrific book.
B00B5A9FLY|5.0|I was very sad about the ending.in fact I cried.but it was a wonderful series and will watch the entire thing again at a later date
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|This is another good game if you like the challenge you got to have speed. don't blink your miss some colors.
B007M45PMU|4.0|Great band<br />Pretty mellow overall in comparison to hit Oh Hey<br />would rec to friend to check out and def worth the 5-10 bucks
B00BU8RNCE|4.0|Make sure you have a huge box of tissues handy while watching this! It is very well done. The focus is not really on the disaster itself but rather on one family's quest to reunite after the waters recede. It is a true story and a photo of the real family is shown at the end. Outstanding performances by Naomi Watts and by Tom Holland (oldest son Lucas). Excellent special effects and scenery.
B007MU85D0|5.0|Great album<br />Love just about every song<br />Cant wait for their next album<br />Heard at Newport Folk Fest, great live sound too<br />Worth buying
B0002F6AH0|5.0|Very in depth and informational.  There is so much content that it takes a long time to get through and some of the episodes cover several years while another may cover a single action.  But it is the best WWII documentary series I have ever watched.
B004SOR4H6|3.0|After downloading this app for my Kindle, I began to notice a few glitches a that may annoy those who use Twitter often. For example, it sometimes has problems retrieving my interactions, although when I go to the site it will show that I have several new ones. Also, the app has trouble loading new profile pictures and cover photos when you changed them on the site and not the app. The selections you can make (such as retweeting or replying to a Tweet) are not captioned and can be a bit difficult for the infrequent Tweeter to understand. If not for these flaws, the app would be virtually perfect.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|This show has well developed characters. You get involved in their lives and want to find out what happens next
B00CAJMGDI|5.0|I almost never review anything but I instantly fell in love with this album. Lindsay has found a way to flawlessly incorporate a violin into dubstep music. I would give her YouTube videos a view just to see how cool she is.
B00CDT41RY|5.0|People kept saying \\"If you like Tarintino it's good\\" They were wrong. If you like an action packed good old revenge movie, it's good. Don't get hung up on the Tarintino part.
B00AYQNOFI|5.0|anthropologically this movie is fascinating! There is so much culture and so much color throughout the world that we don't recognize
B00CCFZO6Q|5.0|This album is absolutely amazing. It's not something that was meant to be listened to through headphones. You really need to feel the music. It's not the same was Wolfgang Amadeus Phoenix, but that's a good thing. I loved the previous album, and the songs were definitely catchy. However, this new album has a new feel to it. It's the same Phoenix, but the songs have so much more depth to them musically now than they did before. It's definitely an album that will grow on you. I absolutely love it. This is my favorite Phoenix album.
B008Y7N7JW|4.0|really good for the whole family. love the intense scenes. Will she choose Peeta or the other guy from the villiage? Team Peeta!!!
B009R659L8|5.0|Always enjoy a Mary Higgins Clark book.  She simply keeps you entertained & guessing who is the killer.<br />Looking forward to her next book.
B005LAIIHG|4.0|We will watch this movie over again, mining more out of the thought provoking themes.  Very well presented with excellent scenery.
B004VMUS9G|2.0|I listen to music on my kindle at night so I refuse to turn my volume up all the way, but I have the kindle plugged into speakers and even with that it's too quiet.  If my phone's alarm app can override volume, why can't this? Did like the math problem option but not worth if you can't hear the alarm.  deleted
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Well worth the money. If you happen to be intrigued by ancient  mystery schools or enjoy some good illuminati tomb raider conspiracy this is for you. You feel like a true adept as you solve th e puzzles of the  ' Null'. Purchase and enjoy.
B00633W614|5.0|I eagerly await his next book.  Enjoy this authors real characters that seem real to me and hate to see the book end.
B0049P1VHS|4.0|I bought these for stocking stuffers at Christmas it was a great price an great gift for all my kids
B00004UOVT|5.0|People rave about Oxygene but to my mind this album is better in every way. I wish M. Jarre would give it the same treatment he gave Oxygene and re-record it.<br /><br />I hadn't listened to it in about a decade as I only have it on vinyl and cassette tape, and when I moved house and had a kid the non-CD collection was put into storage. Somehow I never got around to re-equipping with a digital copy of this recording (I often run bits of it in my head as I used to play it *a lot* pre-move), but when I fired it up I was transported right back into the late seventies when I first heard it, and my memory of the piece was all but perfect.<br /><br />The sound seems great to my old ears. If the remastering has screwed it up I couldn't tell that was so. The recording seems vibrant and sharp, as it should be. JMJ didn't drown his music in bass, but explored the whole range possible on the analog machines used to make this recording. That said, nothing pumps the blood like an analog sequenced synth, an ARP or modular Moog, pounding a well-designed bass line. Equinoxe Part IV proves that.<br /><br />Musically, this was a clear successor to Oxygene but has more life in it. I find Oxygene to be rather turgid in places, it never wants to run even in it's most energetic parts. This is not the case with Equinoxe, which changes up the pace and mood with each movement (there are eight parts identified on the sleeve but your ears will tell you there should be more). It's almost like JMJ found his legs after Oxygene. Equinoxe is exuberant where Oxygene is ponderous.<br /><br />At least to my ears and mood.<br /><br />The sleeve shows my copy to be a French pressing (if that is the right term for a CD; &#34;French Etching&#34; didn't seem to convey the proper context :o)) with sleeve notes in that language. My command of French is abysmal so I am downhearted.<br /><br />But not enough to drop a star.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game, when I first played it, made me play it every spare moment I got. It is pretty good
B00633W614|5.0|As usual Jeffrey Archer has wove another great tale.  Make sure you read these chronicles in the correct order.  Can't wait for the third book to be abvailable.
B0060FXBNM|3.0|The quality of the picture was excellent, however getting the movie to play took several tries. it happened to each disc. I had to shut off and restart my dvd player in order for it to even read the disc.
B003G4W49C|5.0|Ender's Game remains one of the few books that I read again and again. This Kindle version works very nicely and I would recomment it to any one.
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|A game where you can make your own Jurassic park, SWEET!!!!! Plus I really like the code red mode over all highly recommended for any Jurassic park fans
B00881PTRC|4.0|I like this game. I played it for about 2 hours. hurry up and bye while its free!! otherwise it is totaly worth 99&cent;
B001EA4M7M|2.0|The actors read their lines as if they were reading them out loud. The actress portraying Miss Elizabeth Bennett kept rolling her eyes. Really quite humorous!
B00992CF6W|5.0|Jimmy Johnson<br /><br />I hate that the default for amazon is to be able to purchase something with no protection with the default in app purchase setting to allow.  I think this criminal because it's kids that are playing these games and they just hit stuff.  Amazon has lots a lot of credibility with me over this
B0041KBWM0|5.0|Beautifully filmed and portrayed. Very enjoyable to watch and understand the story. I would view this version of Emma again.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|I absolutely love this app, you can select more than one sound and change the volume to each individual sound as you layer them. i love this app, helps me fall asleep and is good background noise to other activities (reading, meditating, etc.) i would definitely recommend this to anyone who is looking for a sound app that they can customize!
B00992CF6W|5.0|The game is very fun,more fun than any other game ive played,theres just one thing.the xbox and pc version has allot more u can do and it would be really awesome if u could make an update to add atleast some &quot; &quot;of what the xbox and pc version has.
B004V2AWKG|5.0|My daughter ordered this book for a school reading project. Great book! I'm sure she will read it again at some point.
B009NG1Q96|4.0|I'll start this review by saying I loved The Selection. I've been anxiously looking forward to the sequel for months, and had very high expectations for it. While I don't want to say I didn't like the book as a whole, I will say that it didn't live up to what I was hoping it would be. I'd give 3.5 stars, if that were an option.<br /><br />I'm going to assume that people reading this review read (and probably liked) The Selection, so I'll mainly write about differences in this book that made me not love it like I did its predecessor.<br /><br />For one, I felt like America was a much weaker character in this book. In the first book, we see her standing up for herself and giving her opinions honestly and openly. In this one, she just felt...less. She was very rash and impulsive in some of her actions, and when confronted with them, she's stumble out something along the lines of \\"I'm just so confused\\" or \\"I don't know why I did that\\" and it just felt weak to me. I was expecting the brave and open girl from The Selection, and I felt like she checked out for most of this book. She did still have some brave moments, but I feel like overall she was less decisive and confident in who she is. Her inability to make (and stick to) a decision kinda drove me crazy.<br /><br />One of the other differences that I didn't like were the actions of Aspen and Maxon. While their characters don't exactly `change' from the first book, it feels like they both said and did things that would make the reader alternatively love, and then hate, them. In one chapter, Maxon would bare his heart and make America (and the reader) love him the most, and then would essentially ignore her for a week. Then in another chapter, Aspen would be in the right place at the right time and make America love him more. This is to be expected in any book with a love triangle, but it happened way too much in this one. I lost count of how many times America \\"made up\\" her mind, and then changed it. One to two times is fine, more than that just makes it feel like drama for the sake of drama.<br /><br />The last thing I'll mention that I disliked in the book is the ending. Without spoilers, the ending is pretty similar to that in The Selection, in that it's fairly abrupt and includes America thinking about the future. In my review for The Selection, I talked about how the abrupt ending didn't bother me as much as many other readers, but it did irk me in this one, likely because I didn't love the whole book like I did the last. I don't like that I waited so long for something that I wasn't crazy about, and I don't like knowing that it'll probably be a year before the conclusion for the series comes out.<br /><br />Now that I've ranted about all the negatives, I will say that I still overall liked the book. There are interesting developments with some of the characters, and I feel like this one tackled the whole \\"dystopian\\" aspect of their world more than the other. Despite America driving me crazy, the ending of this book gave me hope that she'll be stronger in the next installment. The book was still good enough to keep me interested (I read it all in one sitting), and I'm still a fan of the series; I'll just try to lower my expectations for the next book.
0062082353|5.0|My husband ordered this book as soon as it was released. Very awesome stories from a wonderful man. His passing came very hard for us. Rest in peace Chris Kyle, a true American Hero!
B005RJ6DUK|5.0|I got this movie for my husband as a surprise.  He would catch it on cable whenever he could and he would always say &#34;I got to get this movie&#34;.  So I snuck and ordered it for him.  I am happy with the delivery and condition of the movie.  It came to me neatly packaged and it arrived on time.  As far as the movie goes, well obviously my husband loves it as he is a fan of both Robert DeNiro and Chazz Palmiteri, and mob movies in general.
B0001XAOLQ|1.0|I did not play this DVD within the timeframe to qualify for a return. When I did play it the first disc had glitches and the second disc had nothing.
B006RUJST6|4.0|This attractive cover with built in light has made my reading a whole lot better.  Reading in bed is a pleasure, and I can turn room lighting off and still read.  The down side is that the light is a bit glaring unless positioned just out of one's eyes.  The little pull out light which sits at a 45 degree angle seems vulnerable to breakage, but so far so good.
B007BVOEPI|5.0|I enjoy time period productions like this. This is very well done, very intertwined and keeps your interest from episode to episode.
B009VMN3RA|4.0|This was a riveting read, a real page turner. The author shared excruciatingly intimate details that made me cringe. I was surprised to read how her spiritual mother could be so uncaring, even cruel. Certainly her father, too. But Sachi also is quick to blame herself for mistakes she made. Fortunately, she survived the craziness of her youth.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Love all Nicholas Sparks books but this one is defineitly top three.  Very down to earth and real.  Loved it.
B004GUSG4M|5.0|This intensely compelling and well-written book builds in suspense in a completely original way, and explores the organization of the protagonist's world in the face of a severe deficit of memory. Pieces of the puzzle come together in a very interesting and naturalistic way. I &#34;couldn't put it down,&#34; and commend the author for this work of art, which not only is believable but is well-researched as well.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|We enjoyed the movie but the book has more detail about the animals, India, and spirituality. It's a book you can't help but want to share with someone as you read along.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|I have been a loyal player of the Hungry shark games; But this edition is by far the best! The graphics are great and it saves your scores and you play as many sharks AND you can dress the shark!  There are things in the game that can be bought by gems that you buy or earn. I highly recommend this app to anyone.
B004J4WKTW|5.0|A perfect blend of mystery, romance, and childlike dreaming made this story impossibility put . A wonderful life message presents itself slowly as the story progresses leaving the reader with a pleasant urge to ponder the circus of life.
B00127RAJY|5.0|It will work only if you have the determination to stay with it. It is very demanding and Jillian cuts you no slack.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Probably the best series I have ever watched on TV.  Of course, Downton Abby has almost a cult following.  I don't know why but I have a fascination for British TV presentations.  This one is the best.
B000LCJ4AE|5.0|Although the book is non-fiction, it is written in an interesting way. Aliens and UFO's: Corso exposed SO much more than I expected. His credentials make the book credible.
B00CDT41RY|5.0|Excellent movie. Great storyline and acting. Easy to see how it received the two awards. Long movie at over 2-1/2 hours, but there are no parts that cause a lost of interest. Fun and exciting from beginning to end.
B0086700CM|4.0|I find this game to be very challenging.  It is good for eye/hand coordination exercise.  It definitely requires good consentration skills.
B004U8VWLE|4.0|Nina's instability was established early on and really set the theme for the movie. Nina's character was well developed, but since the film was from her point of view we don't learn much about the other characters.
B002VPE1AW|5.0|I saw this movie first run; had a hard time forgetting about it, so I had to own it.  Each time I watch it I catch another nuance.  good, good movie
B00BHU2A7I|4.0|Although it starts out a bit slow, this turns into a great movie.  The more you know about Hitchcock and his personal life, the more interesting the movie.  Highly recommend watching Psycho and maybe some of his other movies before watching this - all the more interesting when you are familiar with his work.<br /><br />Enjoyed the marital relationship story.  Uplifting movie.
B005LAIIHG|5.0|I ordered the movie based on outstanding reviews vs. basically less awards than possible...a combo I tend to like....and this was no disappointment.  The movie moves well, and while the story seems unbelievable, you want to believe it; and, the ending relieves and enlightens.  I don't want to give more particulars so as not to spoil the adventure of viewing it for yourself.
B009KS4XRO|3.0|Good game I gave if a 3 because of freeze ups and loss of credits. Needs to go little slower and stop giving so many dam. Coins that always seems to come out first during htg items and tournaments.
0451232852|5.0|I HATE getting into a book only to have it end a few pages later.  No worries with this one.  I don't read every day, but I do go through books pretty quickly.  This one has lasted a month or two.<br />I've learned a lot about this time period in history and appreciate the fiction and story Ken Follett weaves around it.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|I LOVE THIS!!! I feel like a child again. My boyfriends sons play this and they showed me what they were doing. I was hooked.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Thrilling, edge of your seat excitement woven into a beautiful love story. Another great story, well done Nicholas Sparks, well done.
B005MLOKXA|4.0|I like the story lines; but could do without so much sexual content.Personalities are very well portrayed.  Will continue watching
B0091LS07E|5.0|I love Girl on Fire and a Newer kind of me, overall it is an excellent diverse  album, I recommend it.
B004QKNXIQ|5.0|As a 28 year old straight male, I can confidently say that this is a great movie for any demographic.
B001416P4Y|5.0|Classic recording of Rubinstein performing Chopin's nocturnes. This is a must-have for any fan of piano music, old or new.
B009VB9VKY|1.0|Poor writing, no character development, uninspired in every way.  I guess the only positive thing I could say is that I almost believe that Matthew McConaughy is the character he portrayed.  Nothing was believable, and rather than just a waste of time, it brought negative time spent in watching this.
B0086213XW|3.0|A story of a woman, supposedly happily married, who turns into a cheating whore. if you're into the nudity, go see it. Otherwise, not worth the trouble.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|Beautiful,vibrant underwater sealife.People of all ages will have fun,and share alot of laughs with Memo and his friends.I would highly recommend this game to all my friends and family.
B000005ALP|5.0|This is a classic for those that like the Eels.  For those that don't know them, this is a great one to take a chance on! I am replacing a scratched disc.
B001I45UFC|5.0|First time reading these. C.S. Lewis is a great author... wish I would have read these when they first came out.
B001IYCMNA|5.0|We have three of these in our office now.  They all work flawlessly.  They are easy to configure.  The first two have been in continuous service without a power cycle for 3 years now.  So, when the need arose for #3 we went with what works for us.
B005F2BBLK|1.0|I had to stop this video because it was not playing.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|How can you buy these online and then not rate that you love them?  Why spend money on something you don't really love and want to keep forever???  Daryl Dixon, I love you!  Even on my very small 13&#34; screen!
B008AK8FHM|4.0|This book brings into focus or clarifies thoughts and feelings I have, to love others and be loved by others
B0095ZMMCK|4.0|I would rate this one the best of the Campus series. Good plot, good bad guys, good action. Not particularly believable but that is just Clancy.
B009GEYX5E|2.0|It's a nice story they tell.  I get it.  It's all very impossibly impressive or impressively impossible.  One of the two.<br /><br />So....back here on this planet you'll spend 25 bucks for 8 pictures and 3 of them look kind of maybe decent in a Lomography sort of way. If you have to use your Polaroid camera that uses integral film, and some people do, then it's this or the equally unpredictable and expensive expired film.<br /><br />Me?<br /><br />I say if you want to play with a Polaroid instant camera, get a Polaroid that uses pack film.  Yes, the peal apart kind.  You want to kick it old school and go analog?  Than lets do it right.  There are millions of Land cameras out there that use pack film and some are pretty dang good cameras.  Your pictures will look like...like pictures...real pictures...not the analog version of Instagram.  The film is cheaper - use Fujifilm FP-100C for the color and the Fujifilm FP-3000B for the black and white.
B001O22ELQ|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies!<br /><br />I love the songs, love the story, and love the characters.<br /><br />Also, there's no overly harsh language, so I can put this on for my younger (10-15 year old) cousins and they'll enjoy it too.
B003730LRY|4.0|Good entertainment for the grandkids when they visit and there isn't anything to watch on tv. Keeps them busy for a couple hours.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This book truly does keep me reeling. I'm not a huge fan of reading, but I simply must for this trilogy. Excited for Mockingjay now!
B009ZQCT6S|4.0|Kinky boots was the first transgender movie I ever watched, and i was entertained.  Foreign movies have always interested me and this one was fun to watch.
B007BVOEPI|5.0|A wonderful find, it was great to watch the whole of season 1 without having to wait for each episode.<br />Now for season 2...
B00BSBT8M6|5.0|Best ever cinematography.  Amazing graphics.  Great animal scenes.  A pleasure to watch.  But the story was the best part.  It is hard to comment on it without giving away the plot, but let's just say that I was replaying the movie in my head for days.
B00AN0KBJC|5.0|I only recently discovered this series.....I really enjoyed it. A total escape - I'm sure it was better because I downloaed the full season and did not have to wait for each episode.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|Love this show. No problems with buffering or loading when watching it. I would suggest it to anyone who like HBO or other cable shows.
B000RZIGVS|5.0|Perfect condition. More than I expected. Perfect for those who love Star Trek and want to enjoy it over and over again.
B0055PGUYU|5.0|This is a good read and provides a lot of insight into how much we do on remote control or programmed to do.  For novices on this subject this book is fin to read.  However it does make you think.
B00881PTRC|5.0|This is such a cute game. I love the animations and the silly things that happen. You get more guesses than usual which is good. Also the music is great! Really glad to have this!
B00BHMETKC|5.0|I liked this movie.  John Candy steals the movie.  It's great to know there are brave men willing to risk everything for others.
B005SAJJHM|5.0|It is a great show very funny.  I have watched all of the seasons on amazon. and laugh every time.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|I love tyhat Big Fish Games has brought their products to the Amazon app store.  I loved playing on the PC and now I love playing thm on my tablet.  I only wish there were more of them!
B008AK8FHM|4.0|I was opened to a new way of seeing life by reading this book. A brief, worthwhile look at the breadth of human experience.
B003ZFCBJ0|2.0|Miley Cyrus' character was just a mean, spoiled brat of a girl! Acting was average and story line was a bit boring! The movie was slow and depressing!
B0058VW36U|5.0|zeptolab, this app is cool. I love the effects of cut the rope. The best part is the lantern box.
B00371XIJE|5.0|This was my second time to see Hachi. Such a heart warming movie that shows the true loyalty of a dog.
B008XG1X18|5.0|It works wonderfuly and I use it every day. I strongly recomend this app. Pictures are clear everything is easy to use and people are easy to follow and unfollow.
B00BVYLBP2|4.0|Clone of a clone that is a clone, wondering how many clones there are of me, who's the original and we're getting killed off... Smashing!!!  I'm enjoying this series!!!  3 episodes in and I'm hooked!  Won't spoiled it much more for ya, but I do recommend this series.  :)
B00BGIC2J2|2.0|The story is generally depressing, constant bickering so much so that it made me want to turn it off.<br />I believe that the plot was good just too much of one thing.
B005NF2UE6|5.0|The cds is amazing and i would buy it again for a gift for my daughter,makes a great gift,it got here super fast
B008IJTFYW|5.0|This product is great for yoga meditation sleeping etc...  I love that you can change the sounds around so much. Add. Subtract change how loud each individual noise is. Its wonderful!
B000000H6Y|5.0|i got this cd for my hubby as a gift and he loves it and for the price i couldnt go wrong
B00C90T4QK|5.0|Love his music! He has a great voice. Only part I did not like was the duet with Reese Witherspoon....she can NOT sing!
B004LWZWGA|5.0|the movie was at a great price,i got it for my husband for a gift and he loved it,i will def buy from u again
B0063IH60K|3.0|My husband likes this to just have something to do when he wants to set and take a quick breath.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|Work great.  Fit and work like it should.  Thought my kindle was a goner. So happy it was just the cord
B00AJRQLTI|5.0|Loved the movie and the cast. Perfect to relive the wonderful music and song. Enjoying quite often. Highly recommend this album.
B007BVOEPI|5.0|Addictive as can be!  I love this time period in a show and  I can't get enough of dragons!  I'm really looking forward to future seasons of this show.  You never know what they'll do next.
B00AJF81XE|5.0|Grettings...<br /> I love it...I purchased it for my daughter's birthday...and now i'm going to purchase one for me.<br /> And it's nicely packaged.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|A classy show all the way.  Maggie Smith is superb and everyone is just right in their role - kudos to casting.  This show could go on and on and I can't imagine ever tiring of it.
B009AMANBA|5.0|I love Lincoln history. This was a very good movie taken from an extremely small portion of the book Team of Rivals by Doris Kearn Goodwin. I am glad I read the book first.
B00AHTYI5M|5.0|Viewed online via Comcast. I enjoyed this more than I expected. What an ordeal for the CIA operative played by Ben Affleck. The thread of history --- awesome! The CIA coined the word 'blowback' to describe situations resulting from previous covert operations. Here, I reference the overthrow of the democratically elected Iranian Prime Minister Mohammed Mossadegh in 1953 by US and British operatives.<br /><br />Mossadegh's removal allowed the US and the UK to seat the Shah Mohammed Reza Pahlavi in the position of authority. Twenty-six years later the Ayatollah appeared and American embassy personnel were held captive over 400 days. ARGO tells the story of the efforts of unknown Americans and Canadians determined to assist Americans not yet hostages to flee Iran. I keep the comments very general in hopes of preventing 'spoiler' slips of tongue.<br /><br />Kudos, once again, to Ben Affleck.
B006LSZECO|4.0|This is a great book, and it's really easy to read.  Fynn pulls you in from the beginning, and she keeps you guessing.  I would recommend it to a friend.
B001ANSSDC|4.0|This was a great Read.  Easy, funny and thoughtful.  I have recommended the book to others.  I would like to see the movie now
B00A8ECU24|5.0|I think it's a fun and great game for kids to play. It has games and you can learn from it so I think it's a fun game for kids. So I would consider getting this for your child.
B007TXN4TK|5.0|Hope that I can learn how to do this. It has been alot of years since I have played anything
B006LSZECO|5.0|Both my wife and I read this based on a recommendation by my daughter.  Neither of us could put it down once we started.  The story really draws you in.  We've already recommended to several friends to read.  If you're not familiar with narcissistic or sociopathic behavior, you might not fully come to terms with the ending, but there really are people like this out there! Scary.
0192720015|2.0|The story is wonderful of course. But you should know that this particular edition has no illustrations whatsoever. I was looking for a hardcover illustrated edition for my 6yo. Disappointed.
B004SRPXWQ|2.0|It could use more functionality like at least a trial on the video stuff and other portions of the program.
B005BC3MBQ|1.0|Tried to use a play station 3 and the disc is blank.  No menus or anything else just blank screen
B009VB7P6G|5.0|My oldes daughter (3) she love Tinkerbell and the movie was really fun to watch with her, she says she's tinkerbell
B00AQ71FLK|2.0|DUDE this game takes to much space. It takes up 800mb. You guys need to fix this because I couldn't even download it without deleting all my apps on my kindle fire. Please Change the mb to like 400 or lower please!!!!!!!! I'll recommend this to my friends if you change the mb 400 or lower. Please!!!!!!!!!
B004C3DLJS|4.0|My daughters, my wife and I, we love the toy storie movies, really fun for the family, I recommend to anyone
B005S9EKCW|5.0|This movie is just as good on the small screen as on the large screen.  Great singing and music.  A must for any movie library.
B005LAIH4A|3.0|My daughter liked the movie and I think is a really good way to teach kids the importance of taking good care of the environment
B00A80SHFM|5.0|I would recommend this music to anyone.  Beautiful singing.  Great gift to anyone who loves musicals.  Love to listen to it in the car.
B00A6PD9I4|4.0|My whole family liked the movie, it's really good, I liked the kids running and taking the cake from the lady
B00A50PDDY|5.0|Ironically I only gave Vessel a chance because they are from Columbus, OH (I taught at OSU for 10 years) and the album was under $10.  I listened to the entire thing to see what these men could do, and then I listened to it again, and then again, and then again, and then again, etc. I am now a fan in less than 2 days. There are a few songs that are just OK, but 10/12 of them are great.<br /><br />FYI I am nearly 40 and I listen to mostly classic rock and hard rock/metal. But these guys are VERY talented and their music is unique and addictive.  Anyone looking for something new to enjoy should pick this album up.  It is impossible to describe in terms of genre because each song is layered musically and vocally.  There is a reason why so many people have rated it so high and I am betting that they will be big sooner than later.
B0030IIZ4M|4.0|My daughters, my wife and I, we love the toy storie movies, really fun for the family, I recommend to anyone
B000FBFN1U|5.0|This is the best so far in the series.  I couldn't put it down! The characters are evolving.  So many surprises.
B0030IIYYS|4.0|My daughters, my wife and I, we love the toy storie movies, really fun for the family, I recommend to anyone
B005CVWWJY|5.0|For any tech/computer nerds out there like me, this is a brilliant read. From a technical perspective really thorough and very imaginative... Loved it!
B00BHBBSZ2|4.0|I downloaded Handrite Notes so that I wouldn't have to carry a notepad with me to a photography class.  It worked consistently both with my finger (but my handwriting is terrible, but still legible) and with a stylus.  It was great as I always have my Kindle with me, so taking notes or just jotting a quick reminder is easy as opening my Kindle.
0765350386|5.0|There's something really addictive about the Mistborn Trilogy. What a way to start off the 3 part epic.<br /><br />This novel, from start to finish, is a great read for any lover of well thought out fantasy adventures. The characters are funny, intriguing and you really do care what happens to them. We see the story from 3 perspectives - Vin, Kelsier and the Lord Ruler's thoughts at the beginning of each chapter. This gives nice depth to the story.<br /><br />Now, I've read a lot of epic fantasy, however, I would have to say that \\"Allomancy,\\" is one of the most interesting ideas for the powers some of these characters posses. The categorization of Misting's and Mistborn's is also quite cool. The burning of different types of metal, to produce reactions in the body giving the different powers depending on what metal they've burned, is such a cool idea!<br /><br />I won't give too much away, but if you want a great series to read, that'll keep you busy for months, BUY THE WHOLE TRILOGY!<br /><br />Sanderson is one creative man, a video game is in the works, can't wait for the movie!
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Another great book by John Gresham can't remember such a twist in any of his previous books but it had been a while would definitely read  again
B0015DYIH2|5.0|I have watched the movie  over and over. THE BOOK FILLS IN AND ADDS SO MUCH INFORMATION OF AND ANSWERS THE QUESTIONS I HAD. T HATED TO COME TO THE END. SLUCASH
B009NG1Q96|5.0|I am already looking forward to book 3.  America continues to impress and surprise. I am rooting for her and Maxon.
B0090P98Z4|5.0|Great game, keeps you wanting to play more. Graphics are great with plenty of levels. Am looking forward to the multi player.
145210655X|5.0|I bought this for my husband for Father's Day last year and he and our boys (age 6 and 4) all love it.  There are a few comics that the boys don't understand fully, but overall this is great.  We just received the second book about Vader and Leia for this Father's Day and it is equally as funny.
B005SAJJHM|5.0|I really like this show.  The mixture between highly intelligent and not so highly intelligent along with their interaction.  Love it.
B009LMTDL0|5.0|I was reluctant to read this book and I know many women who feel the same way.  I think that we are used to feeling shamed by women who have made different choices (I am a lawyer but am staying home with kids now and have no plans to return to my former profession) and perhaps guilty about the path not chosen.  Also, the path for American women is tough these days and somehow the problem feels maybe too big to know how to tackle.<br /><br />This book sets out the beginning steps of what we all need to be doing and does it in a very accessible and readable style backed up with credible research and interesting personal examples.  The basic thesis of this book is that there are not enough women in leadership positions and that all women should set leadership as their goal, no matter what profession they choose.  Not until women are fully represented as leaders not only in business, but also in politics, in police departments, in construction -- in whatever professions women work in -- will we be truly represented and able to effect true systemic change which can help not only women but all of American society.  Read the book!  Really!
B004EFYZ1C|3.0|After you know what you can do, it looks great.  EVEN the BACK SIDE  of the moon.<br />Might want to put a pin where we landed.
0810989956|5.0|He loves this series. Hard to find any of them that he hasn't read as yet. It's a good way to keep boys reading.
B00C7GY8Y4|4.0|This is a very chill album... Her voice is always on point.  Has an 80s feel to it.  Love it!
B00BD2DRHW|2.0|This game was going along great, really enjoying it, then when I got to island number four bridge 3 or 4 I could not go any further.  The game just freezes and pushes me back to my home screen.
B007T7MIR0|4.0|It does what I expected from the viewer.  I wish I had the money to upgrade to the usable version of office!
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|It just catches my attention making me want to read more! The  can always feel the characters feelings, if they're happy or sad, I.... It's just amazing!
B005S9EKCW|4.0|The actual product lives up to typical Blu-Ray standards (that means good)<br />The sound on the Blu-Ray actually sounds more balanced than when I saw it in the theatre.<br /><br />The movie itself, some like it, some hate it.  That is up to you.  The strong singers are still strong and the weak characters are still weak.
B008VVT51U|5.0|Anyone that is aging and/or has parents that are aging should watch this movie - it really is brilliant!  I will watch it many times I am sure - the actors are positively wonderful!
B0060MYM7O|5.0|If you need to actually read a review on this product, it means you are spending valuable time not ordering it.<br /><br />This in turn makes it take longer for you to order it and it get delivered to you.<br /><br />This is turn makes it take longer for you to get it in the mail and watch it.  Order it now.<br /><br />Sound and Visuals are amazing.  The show is incredible.  Why are you still reading this?
B001ANSSDC|5.0|Nice, easy read.  I wanted to read the book before watching the movie.  An interesting insight into a mentally unstable person's mind.
B00BLCHYKU|4.0|After watching Vikings, my husband is not sure whether to claim his ancestry or not! However, this is a very compelling and engaging miniseries. The History Channel seems to have done a very good job re-creating the life and times of this early people. Depictions of actual events and people helps with the 'realism'. For example, knowing of the attack on Lindisfarne, the legend of Ragnar, the use of early navigation techniques makes seeing them more intriguing. The depiction of the religions is also very interesting.<br /><br />The 4 star rating reflects my apprehension to give a whole sale recommendation because of the violence.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Season 3 really left you wonder with each episode. There were a couple episodes that seemed to be boring, but you just knew they were going to make up for it. Not every episode has to be about a major struggle to survive. Seemed to be as soon as you thought they were getting comfortable something big would happen to them.
B005MLOOJA|5.0|I came to this series late. I was totally surprised by how good it is. I enjoy the &#34;law talk&#34; and the twists and turns.
B000VMFDW2|4.0|It shows the true horrors of war in the style one would suspect of someone of that age.  I read it from beginning to end without stopping.  The losses endured would shock people today if the U.S.  suffered the same in the U.S.'s conflicts of today.
B00000EU9E|5.0|Got this for my Dad to listen to on the road. His bike only plays cassettes so he needs good music. He loved it!
B006BOT28U|4.0|Although hard to follow at times with the back and forth banter, an overall good read that helps you understand how to think through any situation rationally and come up with a solution.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Just loved EL James books, read all three books two times and would read more.  Never knew what was coming next keeps you excited to read and find out more.
B009ZZDNT6|4.0|Great free app! Haven't had a chance to use it much, but would definately consider purchasing this app to remove the advertising and access the extra features!
B004EPZ084|4.0|It's good for a laugh, and that's why I bought it.  Not the best comedy, but well worth what I paid.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|This is the 2nd best game I have played...great fun.  Now if Amazon would add Candy Crush and Hay Day to they list of games that are available on Kindle Fire I would be very happy.
B00846REIS|4.0|I've seen many reviews comparing this book to 50 shades, (which I loved) I see some similar things, like some dom/sub action staring to come out, and sexual abuse. But this couple is very different. Eva has fought her way to being strong and Gideon has tried to move on with his life to be somewhat normal. The path for these two is so different I really hate to compare to the other book. Looking forward to seeing them work on the relationship. Can it work..will they make it and the supporting cast of characters , what will happen to them? Wish the price was lower..very expensive for a e-book.
B008XG1X18|5.0|love how it gives u ideas for crafts, Diy, weddings, food, clothes, Homer decor so basically everything hehehe<br />and its all in one place
1250012570|5.0|John Green first bought Eleanor & Park to my attention. He raved about it and I knew I had to read it. So I brought it on the day it was released and actually let it sit on my bookshelf for weeks! But after so many more praises from people I trusted, I decided I had put it off long enough.<br /><br />After being kicked out of her house by her stepdad, Eleanor is forced to move in with the neighbors. To make matters worse, her family moves away without her knowledge and for a whole year, she doesn't hear from them. Then one day at school, her mother arrives to take her home. When she arrives, she notices her siblings and mother seem to be under her stepdad Richie's control and one thing is for sure- she isn't welcomed. On her first day of school on the bus, nobody wants her to sit with them. She's on the bigger side and her red curly uncontrolled hair is even bigger and to top it off, she dresses bizarrely. Parks saves her and allows her to sit with him. But this isn't your typical hero saves heroine romantic moment. It's anything but romantic.<br /><br />For days they don't speak to each other. Finally, they embark on a friendship through comic books and music and slowly love blossoms.<br /><br />Eleanor may be cold and mean but she has a reason for acting the way she is. She knows what rejection and isolation feels like and as a defense mechanism; she becomes sarcastic and doesn't let anyone in. She's bullied and tormented every day at school and lives in constant fear at home because of her stepdad. Her life is devastating and breaks your heart.<br /><br />Park's the awkward but somewhat popular Asian kid. He comes from a functional and loving household. His parents' marriage is significant to him. After 19 years of being married, they are still madly in love, and I believe this influences Park. He believes in love and happily-ever-after's, which is why he's so sweet, thoughtful, and patient with Eleanor. After noticing Eleanor reading his comic books, he would open the comics wider and turn the pages slower. He lent her his comics and waited to read all the new ones with her. He gave her batteries so she can listen to her Walkman at home and he made mixed tapes of all the songs he thought she would like. And man was he corny, but in a good way that had me sighing and smiling.<br /><br />Everything about their relationship is intense: the handholding, their conversations, and their love. They're the underdogs you can't help but root for.<br /><br />As much as I loved Park, I would have to say my favorite part was the ending; it could not have been more perfect. It was real. Eleanor and Park's love story was sweet, tender, and memorable- everything a first love should be. Once I started reading, I could not put it down. I devoured it and loved everything about it: from the music all the way to the time era. If you're looking for a love story, I recommend Eleanor & Park without hesitation, a must-read in my opinion.
B00004VVND|5.0|was in great shape.I love this movie.It came quickly and im glad i bought it.I was looking for it for a while.
B008HK3XU4|5.0|I do love this, but wish I had seen the one that tilts horizontal or vertical I would had rather had it. But I am satisfied with it.
B00005JKDR|5.0|ive been looking everywhere for this movie at a good price,and it was.It came quick in the mail.Im so happy
B008602KQI|5.0|A great job of translating book to film and definitely has something for all age groups!!! An awesome watch and a must see!!!
B000NMW6M0|2.0|To me the movie had a slow start and did not come full circle. There were too many seperate stories within one movie
B00BVYNSLC|4.0|Missed the first episode so bought this one. It's a good series. The premise is new and refreshing. Clones unknown to each other are thrown together by an unknown enemy with deadly intent.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love this.  I had downloaded a Bible to my Kindle before, but it is literally the full book.  This app makes it easier to read excerpts of the Bible on a daily basis, or whenever you choose.  It has a verse of the day.  It also has &#34;Plans&#34; which are suggested readings in a specific area, ie. family, parenting, forgiveness, etc.  When you begin a plan, it will automatically give you a reading for the day on that subject.  I plan on using this app every day.
B009U9S6FI|5.0|One of the deepest books I have ever read. I enjoyed reading it on my Kindle because I could high light many of Frankel's ideas. I will reread it in the future.
B004T4LUPW|5.0|It's easy to use and it syncs my Google calendars (both work and personal) with my Kindle, so I can look at and update the calendars at any time and I don't have to copy anything to a hard copy personal agenda.  Since I don't have a smart phone, this is a great alternative.
B00BU8RNCE|3.0|I guess I've seen too much about the tsunami and knew too much about the story for it to be anything worth watching. I'm annoyed with myself for renting it but so thankful I didn't pay to see it in the theater. I actually fell asleep at one or two parts and my leg falling off the bed woke me up. The oldest son was wonderful; he was the star of the movie and deserves the recognition, more so than Naomi Watts. They all did a fine job acting, and God bless that family for going through what they did, but they were lucky, what a horrible tragedy. God bless everyone over there.<br />If you have the option to wait for this till it comes on cable or get it free instead of renting, you're better off. Not that it's horrible, it just would have been better as a Lifetime movie.
B008XG1X18|5.0|This is a great app to use Pinterest on your Kindle.  I love Pinterest.  That it is a major time drain is another matter.  :-)
B008AK8FHM|1.0|The author seems to be confused between what is spiritual and scientific. As a Christian that read some books on after life, this book seems to focuses on personal agenda than presenting what he sow.
B004SBS8LA|4.0|My grandson who is 8 likes it. My 3 year old grandson just likes to diddle on the Kindle. Good
B001I45UFC|5.0|I couldn't make it through the prequel, &#34;The Magician's Nephew.&#34; So, I let the entire series gather dust on my shelf. My son was reading about two dads and two moms and how wonderful rainbows and unicorns are in the books he brought home from school. So, we started this book on Daddy's kindle to teach him how to use it and to learn how to read. It has changed my life! Before, it was &#34;winter and never Christmas.&#34; Now I can say that every day is Christmas and never winter. You owe your postmodern child this book and this experience. Read it to him.
B004SJ3AXI|4.0|They both like to play around with the game. It keeps them occupied for an hour or two and out of mischief.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I loved it , the mix of the games, surviving and love all in 1 is wonderful. I can't wait to start the next 1.
B00BEZTMQ8|3.0|The overall quality of the movie was ok. There was a bit of wear and tear around the corners of the cover and there was even a small tear on the back, which I did not like. But the thing that bugged me the most was that the movie came unwrapped. I thought that it would at least have a plastic cover on it. I would rate the product, acceptable. Not amazing but ok.
B0083ZRAJS|5.0|i would recommend this book to parents and kids alike.its an ole classic with firm morals . my daughter loved it so much
B00992CF6W|5.0|EPIC! this game is the best!!! omg i play it like allll the time!!! yay! tottaly buy this its EPIC!@
B009IEXKXI|1.0|For Me it was very much like listening to someone read the phone book.  I'm sure it's me and not the book.
B00881PTRC|5.0|nice selection (i think the person who said it was too easy and only suitable to a small child perhaps didn't scroll down to find SAT vocab).  i think the animation is i was impressed by the number of choices.  cute and the number of chances you get is just about perfect.  very enjoyable (once i turned the sound off).  worth more than 99 cents.
B008Q0CO0U|5.0|For the most part u can count on Wallberge to deliver and this movie clearly shows why... real good entertainment.
B000N90JGI|5.0|One of my favorite romantic comedies...could watch it over and over again and it still makes me cry (I know - I'm a wimp!).
B00BGIC2J2|4.0|The film re-uses some formulas that have become very familiar to those of us who have been watching movies coming from this bunch. In this case there is more than enough funny stuff to make it worth a watch. Rudd and Mann definitely have chemistry and the guest appearances are funny. I would recommend the unrated version if you don't mind some additional smutty humor.
B000TCEU4Q|5.0|i bought this for a friend and he loves this yoke, he is very happy with his product, good price fast shipping, higly recommended!!
B0089EHWQE|5.0|This was such a provocative book. I can't get it out of my mind. It was a beautiful writing feat, of presenting both sides of a very difficult moral decision. It would be a wonderful book club book because it screams for discussion.<br /><br />Jane Shaw
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Even if you think you would have no interest in watching this series, watch one episode and then see what you think. I never thought I would like the show, but I got easily hooked! I love you Masterpiece Theater!
0345803485|5.0|Definitely will turn on your 5 senses, I promise that.  If not you must be dead inside, lol. Very sexy, very naughty reading.
B006TVQU6C|3.0|The case is OK if you are not willing to spend much. It has plenty of room inside for your cables to hide and for your peripherals. I was disappointed in the lack of extra packaging from Amazon. My case must have been dropped because it was not in square and I had to straighten it. Otherwise it is a good looking case with good fans. I like the USB 3 ports on the front but wish it had more.
B0002BO05S|4.0|Very good movie, with suspense and action.  Portrays Our Lord's pain and suffering.  I would recommend buying it and liked the history of Jesus it portraryed.
B001AH6ZWY|5.0|Mathew and Jodie and Skerritt are excellent and well cast for these roles.  I also like the billionaire financier.  Don't know his name.  Anyway great movie, well written and love the worm hole machine.  Well thought out concept and can't wait for the reality.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|It's a pretty quick game once you understand how it works but it's worth it.<br />I didn't want it to end!
B00CDT41RY|5.0|I was kinda long. but full of action, very well done, my wife watched it a second time, money well spent.
B005V2S7FW|5.0|I have been using this app mostly on my desktops (win xp and ubuntu) and laptop (mac). Very impressive and functional. You can have LastPass generate both your user name and password, and specify the number and character classes to use during the generation. The information is then automatically filled in when you return to the site. From the LastPass web site, they claim the information is encrytped prior to sending to their servers. A number of options are available from your end with respect to log on when you open your browser, how long the app will remain open after you close your browser, etc. I have used Lastpass with IE, Firefox, and Chrome. As I do not use Safari, I cannot speak for that browser.<br /><br />The app is free for desktops and laptops, but for mobile devices, the company charges about $12 per year.
B008B1BL4E|5.0|This is one of the best of the current crop of big-picture, \\"How and why did it start?\\" books about the Great War.<br />Despite the title, this book does not endorse a \\"Sleepwalker\\" theory at all (except perhaps as regards Britain, and even there not so much).  Very much to the contrary, he shows why war was a rational choice for Austria-Hungary, Russia, France and Germany.  The choice only seems irrational when one knows the outcome for each of these countries' regimes.  Far too much emphasis has been put either on theories of national character (essentially what the German war guilt school comes to) or the last-minute school (Moltke's train schedules, Nicholas' and Wilhelm's last-minute dithering).<br /> The good points of Clark's book are: broad temporal sweep, neither concentrating too much on the June/July 1914 period nor under-emphasizing it; the relative attention paid to Serbia, Russia and Austria-Hungary, while many accounts emphasize Germany and the UK; and a better use of sources than many other authors, who often treat self-serving or post-war writings or utterances by statesmen as probative of highly disputable facts and positions  prior to the outbreak (very few historians have shown themselves immune to this very serious failing).  Neither good nor bad, but no doubt disturbing to some, is Clark's \\"Teutonophilia\\" -- which I put in scare quotes because so many of us have been brought up on the Fischer thesis and, because of Hitler and WWII, find a German war guilt explanation for WWI easy to accept.<br />Clark makes a subtle and low-volume case that the outbreak of war was much more the result (1) Serbian aggression, (2) Austro-Hungary's fatalism, (3) French policy to insure Russian involvement in a German war, and (4) Russian pan-slavism and over-confidence.  By contrast, the decision-making and policies in Berlin and London were less important.  I thought Clark was particularly good in doing what every good historian should, that is, explain to the reader the mindset that existed AT THE TIME; thus, because of the performance of the Tsarist army in the actual war, and the memory of the Russo-Japanese war 9 years earlier, we tend to miss what Clark emphasizes, which is that in 1914 the Russian government was highly confident of its armed forces.  The attention often given to the British-German naval build-ups is, properly, downplayed here;  the powers were probably more concerned about the timing of the build-up of the internal Russian railway system, rather than the timing of the opening of the Kiel canal.<br /><br />Finally, while I gave the book \\"5 stars\\", I should note that it is not particularly well-written.  The prose is serviceable and not overly academic, but lacks the brilliance that some historians have brought to the subject.  Clark makes up for this lack, though, in his fine judgments, unearthing of the contemporary mindset, and careful sifting of the contemporary evidence.
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|Excellent read to give light to the gigantic effort of world war.  Smoothly written.  Puts the reader right into the cockpit of both fighter and bomber planes.  Heros abound.
B0052VUNHC|5.0|I have read this book more than once and find I can't put it down everytime! I only wish this was a series!
B00BDSRKHO|5.0|This is a great release by OMD and is much better than their previous album History of Modern. Kissing the Machine, Metroland, Night Cafe, and Dresden are all great songs!!!
B008RA3X5E|4.0|Not a whole lot to say about this app. It is a useful clock and alarm with basic features including different sounds.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Every time I go in the bathroom to try and kill myself... I play this and its awesome. This is the only reason I haven't died
B004GYY714|5.0|I love this app as it allows me to find and favorite all the radio stations and shows I normally listen too this app has turned my IPad into a very easy to use radio. You can get channels from all over the country.
B007XKEY6Q|1.0|I like this game but you have to have a Facebook Twitter or an e-mail account to play this game I don't have any of those because I am too young just to let you know don't bye this game If you don't have a Facebook Twitter or e-mail account do not get this game it will be a waste of your gigabytes bye bye now
B00632HWOG|5.0|This is the app that probably gets the most use on my IPad. I use this app at least 3 times a day to check e-mails and respond to them. Same app as if you were at your desktop.
B008RA3X5E|4.0|I've been using this app for a couple of weeks and really enjoy it. It's easy to configure and hasn't let me oversleep yet!
B004478AS4|4.0|Great account of life before and during colonization of Nigeria from a Nigerian prospective.  Recommended reading for anyone interested  in African history.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|This book is a grabber right from the first page.  We follow the life and loves of the characters from the first book of the trilogy.  This book is set during WWII when the children that we met in book one are grown.  I can't wait for book three.
B005DJREGQ|5.0|This is the funniest show since the drama of my so called HIGH SCHOOL DAYS,  it hits home for me and also reminded me that high school was really a blast, and I would do it again, even after 20 years later.  It is &#34;AWKWARDLY&#34; funny and true to form, and also reminds me to let go, that there is life after high school.  Started the third season and so far it's still kept me laughing!!!!!!!
B0052FYPJK|5.0|Enlightment and Discovery. A journey into Lee's philosophy. A Master and is world. Our world. An inspiration from the begining till the end.
B005HSL626|5.0|I don't usually play games but I love this one. My kids love it and it is surprisingly not as easy as I would if thought.
B009LMTDL0|5.0|While I have not encountered all of the experiences that Sheryl has, I find that my experiences are even worse in some way working outside of Silicon Valley.  The good-old-boys' club can keep life's influences on work and family/life very seperate.  I have also seen some of my own experiences through another set of eyes so say.  I am viewing some of my own experiences, feeling and situations again and not necessarily coming to the same conclusion.<br /><br />Interesting to read people's reactions to Sheryl's take of her own experiences and at the end of teh day, I think that people need to take it for what it is worth and consider where they need to Lean In.  Some of us need to be more honest at the conference room and kitchen table!
B00C1BU7V8|5.0|Although I have a little understanding of Civil War history, I never understood how much went into and how life changing passing the 13th Amendment was to our country. I also had no idea of how much of his legacy as a moral person, not just as president, went into getting it passed. For people who enjoy mindless action films, they will find Lincoln slow and boring. But to people who have an appreciation for history and the evils of slavery still being felt to this day, Lincoln is a must see. Daniel Day Lewis is riveting in his role. He deserves the best actor Oscar.
B00881PTRC|1.0|hangman stinks it totally crashed my kindle Fire also it is the stupidest game I have ever seen also this app says it is free but it cost me $50
B007VUA7VO|5.0|Like it easy to use. Alerts for recharge. Lots of colors. Need it, get it, got it, GOOD!! Blah blah!
0812973992|4.0|I recently read Molly Ringwald's book 'When It Happens To You; A Novel in Stories'. (And reviewed it here on Amazon.) So a comparison between that work and this one was screaming out to be had.<br /><br />I have (an admittedly arbitrary) way of looking at different craftspeople.<br /><br />There are vocalists...and then there are singers.<br /><br />There are guitar players...and then there are guitarists.<br /><br />There are people who write...and then there are writers.<br /><br />Molly Ringwald is a person who writes. Colum McCann is a writer.<br /><br />Both of them have taken short stories about an assembly of characters and woven them together. 'Overlap' is the theme of the day.<br /><br />I believe Mr. McCann succeeds in telling a good story more than Ms Ringwald. (Although I don't believe the device served even his tale well. Oh, and I could have done without almost all the material about the two Irish brothers in NYC.)<br /><br />He certainly has more chops; I think there were a tiny handful of sections in hers where I sat back in admiration, whereas his contained all kinds of gems. (A couple of them were stellar, reminiscent of Frank DeLillo's beaut, the opening forty-or-so pages of 'Underworld'.) I felt I was in the company of someone with substantial talent, and was entertained by his skill and passion...if not necessarily by the overall story arc.<br /><br />I'd love to have heard him do a reading when the novel was first released.
B00632HWOG|5.0|Had it for years on PC and have it now on  my Kindle HD fire. LOve it easy to use/download.
B002RI9HUM|4.0|I was looking for a lighthearted read, but was surprised to find that this book had a serious side to it and in no time I became intrigued with the story line and what the outcome would eventually be.
B007VUCAVO|5.0|I like being able to see my charging rate and being alerted when it's time for a recharge. Also has cool colors.
B000VAQX0A|5.0|i recently purchased  permanent waves mobile fidelity  disc  excellent superior remaster clean clear balanced  robust and dynamic  superior well done remaster  powerful detailed dynamics this is the very best remaster of this album you will ever hear  i love the incredible sound well worth the purchase very pleased  just a note rush will not be issuing anymore mobile fidelity remasters because of the condition of the master tapes  enjoy the finest remaster of this album if u love rush i highly recommend this mobile fidelity remaster it has a very smooth warm sound not harsh  very well done
B0066WJLU6|4.0|Ok its cool. You can make it glow so many colors. Nice ambience for... Ive used it many times already!
B006LSZECO|4.0|This was a fun-to-read mystery that held my attention from the very first page. How unexpected to read the ongoing case of the \\"gone girl'' from both the husband's and the wife's perspective! Every chapter was full of surprises--who are the good guys in this saga? If you are interested in a fast-paced, enjoyable read, this is the book.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|Just tons of fun. Not the expansive universe stuff like Vinge and Niven, just a fun romp about one man's adventure on Mars. Very well done.
B004J4WKTW|3.0|Written well but a bit too long. I would recommend it maybe for a bookclub. I would read the author again.
B007UWBGVS|5.0|Great it is my third copy now I have one for my kindle one for the car and one for work
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|I enjoyed this adventure and hidden object game Alot!!! There was a ton of puzzles to complete. This was much more than just an Hidden Object story. Best of both worlds in my opinion. The setting was very original and creative. The story was well written and I actually cared about the characters. I highly recommend this app!
B006RXPUR2|3.0|I had to watch Gone Baby Gone for a class on ethics.  This movie was a great example of what is ethical and what is not ethical.  I had never seen the movie before I had to watch it for Ethics.  I did find it to be a good movie.  I found it hard to find out who had the little girl.  When I did find out who had the little girl I was shocked.  It was completely unethical of the cop to do what he did.  But there is a difference between what is ethical or not and what is right or wrong.  Was it ethical that the cop had the little girl?  No it was not ethical, but I thought it was right that he had the little girl.  He was giving her a better life with his family.  The mother was a drug addict, how was she going to give the little girl a normal and healthy life.  It would be nice to see a sequel to see how the little girl ended up and if the mother continued with her drug use.  There is a fine line between ethics and right and wrong.  This movie was a great example of this.  I would recommend renting the movie and not buying it.  It provides good examples, but I did not care for the movie too much.  If wouldn't have been for the class, I never would have watched it.
B00C2VIA52|5.0|Although there are certain quirks with hero selection options, this is still a great dueling card game. Best of all, it is free. The art work on the cards in my opinion is top notch. The campaign is fun, challenging and quite long. You can also go through the campaign with all of the different heroes and pick up free cards for each hero along the way. The only gripe I have is that there is no hero deletion and the hero ability descriptions for powers is vague. Research the hero powers on a wiki site first
B005S9EKCW|5.0|An excellent rendition of the classic.  Beautiful scenes.  Strong characters.  Genuine singing!  All the scores and acting make you feel how you are supposed to feel: indignity, anger, sorrow, suspense.  Must watch, especially for the younger generation who has not viewed this film yet!
B005K0HDGE|5.0|We've heard it so much that it sounds painful - \\"How would history change if you went back in time and prevented the JFK assassination?\\" Before 1963, the same question was asked about the Lincoln assassination. When I first heard about this book, I felt King was treading lightly in a field of land mines, tackling a subject that could so easily drown in clich&eacute;s. Time travel - JFK - Back to the future - How changing the past changes the future ... we've been there, done that in a million stories and films. Why not throw in Elvis and some UFOs? So it surprised the heck out of me that King not only made it through the land mines with all his limbs attached, but that he crafted what, in my opinion, may be one of his best novels ever, if not THE best. I really think only he could have pulled this rabbit out of the hat. I was hooked from page one and could not stop reading until the end. Bravo to the modern day Edgar Allan Poe. What a thrill!
B00BJS7LHC|3.0|...feels like recycled Tarantino.  Reproduced Kill Bill scenes, recycled witty Christoph Waltz character, boring lines.  Ironically, I found the gruesome, disgusting, and racist scenes to be a good wake up reminder to white middle class Americans.  We would love to forget the hatred shown to black american, but this film doesn't let you forget.<br /><br />Still, just an OK movie.  Not bad, but certainly not worth my time.
B00A6PD8RQ|1.0|This movie is a story of outright rebellion and spite. The main character does spitefull things to intentionally hurt her mother and then puts a spell on her mother. There are other Disney characters that have a streak of rebellion (Nemo, Ariel), but this one takes it too far. The Mother was not out to hurt the girl, they just had a communication problem. At the end of the story the girl gets what she wants and has no consequence for the horrible way she has treated her mother. In the end the mother is changed, not the girl. This movie should not be titled Brave, it should be called Stubborn Brat. This movie encouraged kids to disrespect their parents in order to get what they want. Not appropriate for kids.
0394800389|5.0|It's Fox in Socks, what more do you really need to know? It's a fun book to read with the kids, whether they can read or not, the tongue twisters work for everyone.
B0054SMID0|5.0|A great job of portraying the character from the book.  Nicely done. I think they captured the style of what a slick attorney Haller is, yet how he fights for justice within the system.
B00BEJ5O6Q|5.0|As usual, Blake Shelton has a real winner in this one.  Every song showcases his  special style and it appears he can't come up with a less than excellent cd.
B005EGXNLS|5.0|Have read many of his books and there is hardly any that I did not like.  Mot are good enough to read a second time.
B00985E3UG|4.0|The efficient and productive food processing industry has a very dark side to it. You'll be amazed and horrified with the revelations shared in this investigative work by Michael Moss. If I had any doubts about minimizing, better yet, eliminating processed food from my family's diet this book was the final straw.<br /><br />Once we realize that salt, sugar and fat are addictive and manipulated by the food giants as drugs, our return to a more organic, plant-based diet will be so much easier.<br /><br />Well done!
B003LQ3YXU|5.0|Discovered Dr. Who while bored on a long bus commute. It has now become a family pastime!! Season 1 with Billie Piper and Christopher Eccleston remains my absolute favorite Doctor and companion. My 5 year old has a crush on Rose Tyler, and, well, Season 1 hooked us all for good!
B00797MB0O|2.0|There was very little in this movie that I found laughable, from the opening scenes when she decides to cast off her cosmopolitan life to recapture lost love, to the final moments when redemption (and justice) never comes. Theron did a fine job acting, but there isn't much you can do to improve a bad script. I would not recommend this movie to anyone.
B009JZSC9S|5.0|My husband and I enjoy watching the Good Wife. We have followed this show and its characters from its beginning.It is very intertaining.
B005HSL626|5.0|This app is great...it keeps my kids focus while they are having to sit at work with me or while we are waiting in the doc office.
B008602KQI|5.0|I really liked the movie and the quality. I will definitely recommend it to my friends and family.  The plot was excellent and the characters were well played.
B008KYOCA2|5.0|This little calender is great and so cute. I love the icons you can add to your dates to remember.
B001DM1VXE|3.0|Mixed review in our home. The ending and wrap up were lacking as if it wasn't very well thought out. It felt like one of those stories that are better told in a book and don't translate we'll to film....but I don't think there is a book for this one.
B00BWJ7LYG|1.0|Hate to say it, but this was way too boring and I got sick and tired of seeing certian actors head's and enlarged noses superimposed on the bodies of dwarfs/hobbits. Nothing worse than seeing the great &#34;Swearinger's (Deadwood main character) face ruined atop a hobbit body, ugh...
B008Y73940|3.0|I normally don't like M.M. Movies but this wasn't too bad. Good twist at end kept us wondering. Glad I didn't pay to rent on PPV, but glad I watched.
B00AB7HESI|5.0|I LOVE this game! I have a big imagination and absolutely love the game. SCRIBBLENAUTS is my favorite game on kindle fire.
0525952926|5.0|Loved 1st book Fall of Giants, so know I will love this 2nd one. Looking forward to the 3rd book.
B00B2G2RG6|5.0|total sick thriller..but keeps you not being able to watch the next episode! have to watch it in it's entirety from the beginning.
B00BSBXZDY|5.0|This is a great family night movie.  All the actors did an AMAZING job with the voices, and the movie is just as entertaining for the adults.  GREAT MOVIE!!!
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|Having read the book I was happy to see that the movie followed pretty closely to the book, or as best as it could. I'm excited to see how the rest of the books are portrayed.
B00B6QXN56|5.0|Absolutely loved it!  Best music I've heard in many, many years.  Cannot stop listening, I'm driving my wife crazy.  I was lucky enough to discover him because of his appearing on PBS.
B00BHHIWQO|4.0|This is addicting and a fun variation of Bejeweled.  I enjoy the change and find myself hooked on the game.
B00004X10B|5.0|I just received my new camera bag and it is the best one I have ever had.  It swallowed up my Nikon D3200 and all the accessories, lenses, filters, batteries, and with room to also fit my Sony digital SLR to boot. Much more than I bargained for.  I really recommend this gadget bag!!
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|My family and I love this movie. We all read the book and had great conversations over the two. Highly recommended!
1250027624|5.0|A must for all &#34;Downton Abbey&#34; fans! Loved all the background information on the cast, as well as all the pictures.
B00BD2DRHW|1.0|I downloaded it for daughter and she is pretty smart for her age (6) it was too easy for her so she lost interest pretty quickly.
B008Y7N7JW|3.0|good action, story sequence, clarity and sound, details, kind of boring in the beginning. characters interesting and diverse in age,sex and culture
B00AL1ONN8|3.0|It isn't the worst it isnt the best either. Dont get me wrong there are some really good songs like Sorry thanks to Andre 3000.
B00CHMUVV2|5.0|This has to be the best new show this year if not in the last two years. It keeps you on the edge of your seat from start to finish. Whoever said that they thought it was dull is an idiot. Before the show even aired I was excited to see it. I get a little nervous when the promos for a t.v. series look so good that you can't wait to watch it. I am usually let down because they show all the good parts/everything that is interesting about the sitcom in the 90 second previews before it even starts. That was definitely not the case with The Following. I was excited to see it and let me tell you, it did not disappoint. Kevin Bacon plays his role spectacularly well as does James Purefoy. The cast members of Joe Carroll's \\"cult\\" are eerily accurate in their roles of playing psychopaths. I especially love Jacob. His very well acted transformation from a follower to a hard core bad ass psycho was brilliant. He is definitely one of my favorite characters along with Shawn Ashmore who plays FBI Agent Mike Weston. Mike's character starts out in what you assume will be a small role and then he becomes a royal bad ass. Beyond those specifically mentioned, the show is well cast and the acting is spot on. So far, this season is amazing. I'm having a little trouble figuring out what they will do for a second one but I am excited to see. It is definitely a show that you have to watch from beginning to end. You cannot just jump in at say episode 6 because you would be completely lost. If you haven't seen it I highly recommended you giving it a shot. You can watch it from the beginning on Hulu. And even if you think it starts out a little slow give it a chance. You won't be disappointed. It is the best show on t.v. right now.
B0057R5G6E|5.0|Received this rather fast, which was great and it was everything as advertised! The Blu-Ray transfers are great to watch and the extras are interesting for each movie. Some old, some new to me. Love how they pushed the envelope of technology way back when, with the first movie. Still a classic! The sequels stand on their own and are good movies as well. My LAST set of Jurassic Park Trilogy's! [maybe]
B009GEFXLC|5.0|This series just keeps getting better! Can't wait for the rest of this season, and then (fingers crossed) Season 6...
B0060V1WJ6|3.0|This was the first movie I watched on my Kindle Fire. I would say that it was OK. It kept my interest. It is worth a look!
B0002Z1EG2|5.0|The songs on it were just what I was looking for. Will recommend it to people who like her. It is worth getting
B009KS4XRO|2.0|I very rarely give negative reviews, but in regard to app/games,more often then not, with a constant Facebook tie in, it turns out to be a money pit. They give you a few blue buttons to start to buy BINGO cards, but in most cases it is more than one button to buy one BINGO card. With hundreds of players your chances of being one of the few winners are very slim. You win coins to buy power ups but surprise surprise you CANNOT buy the blue buttons to get more BINGO cards. The button to press when you have BINGO overlaps a bit into the lowest blocks of numbers on the Bingo grid and if you brush near it a \\"Bad Bingo\\" is called (calling BINGO when you do not have it) and your card is frozen and you essentially lose the card. The cost for blue buttons starts at $1.99 for 20 blue buttons (remember that the games I did play were six buttons n s for 2 cards, and of course if your child gets hold of your credit card, they have a $99.00 selection!!! While I realize that the companies need to make money, I found another BINGO game on Amazon apps and although I can't recall the name (the icon is a multi colored square with BINGO across it), but I have been playing for quite a while and you CAN convert your \\"winnings\\" into BINGO cards. I have not paid for anything.
B004TI5N38|4.0|Full of suspense leaves you guessing my first David Baldacci read and I am sure looking forward to my next one
B00BHU9BV6|5.0|I wish I could have seen this one in theaters. Although it seems low budget (in not having many different background scenes) it works, and the graphics are amazing.
B000SGSU58|5.0|Michael Connelly is a genius. This is the best police procedural out there, including James Patterson's Alex Cross series. Excellent!
B00005Y7L4|5.0|This is actually my favorite movie of all time -- it's just so...BEAUTIFUL~! ;D<br /><br />WARNING: This DVD is only good in certain regions. I tried playing it in the USA and it wouldn't work. *facepalm* I should have looked more into it before I bought it.<br /><br />Happy Shopping To All! c:
B00AYDC5HY|3.0|This is NOT the movie to let a kid see who has recently had a pet die or had not yet gotten over  the death of a pet.<br /><br />Heck, I felt depressed watching it as an adult.<br /><br />  If it were only so simple: bring your beloved pets back to life ala Frankenstein method.<br /><br />The dog is adorable in this film but so was the real dog who played Sparky in the first version made in the 1980's..<br /><br />I covered a review on the first ever Frankenweenie by Burton.<br /><br /> I now know how he managed to add another hour to this film when the 1st one was just 28 mins.<br /><br />(Family wanted to see this movie so I figured I could spare some time to see how Burton enhanced the plot in this version.)<br /><br />He creates a  storyline not just about Sparky coming back to life, but also about a school science project and this is where( along with the revival of Sparky) science fiction mayhem comes in to play.<br /><br />Children learn the hard way about science can be used for good or evil purposes, but not before things get out of hand.<br /><br />I wish this animated film had not been done in black and white.  It lacked visual clarity.<br /><br /> I know it was meant to set a mood and even give you  an older era feeling, but I think it would have been better in color.<br /><br />Very young children will not get a lot of what is going on.<br /><br />Older kids?  Use your judgement on whether you want to suggest this movie for them.<br /><br />It did not have an abundance of humor.  If you are looking for belly laughs- this is not going to give them to you.<br /><br /> Sparky's owner- the little boy- has grief that is palpable.<br /><br />  This is not the most feel good movie out there for kids or family viewing.<br /><br /> I always thought that animated films for kids should offer them some escapism from the harsh realities of life as they will face those soon enough.<br /><br /> A movie that centers around death and trying to revive the dead, is not my idea of escaping the  sadness we encounter in life, particularly when you lose someone you love.idea of escaping the  sadness we encounter in life, particularly when you lose someone you love.
B008X8P8A8|4.0|Its good but a little confusing and difficult to place some of the buildings at times.  Would like it to be more strategy.
B004AO4FJ4|4.0|It took me a few shows in to start to like it and see what all the fus was about, but soon I finally kept going and enjoyed it. I honestly think it had something to do with the actor who played the doctor. Overall, still better than a lot of other things out there
B001PB3RU8|4.0|i listened to this cd on repeat while diriving and it never got old. i recommend this cd to most people.

B00B6QXN56|5.0|Wonderful versions of many of his old and new classics - but done in a style I had not heard from him.  His vocal talents really come through on this collection, as well as the beauty of the acoustic guitar and back up strings.
B0083Z6AH6|4.0|gooed read, although the characters can be kind of annoying. the main characters are jerks. the central character is nice but a ninny.

B000059XUO|5.0|The Crow has been my favorite movie ever since it was released in the theaters in 1994. I saw it in the theaters 13 times. I think it's exciting, brilliant, exhilarating, fairly well acted, and Brandon Lee does a great job in the main role. What happened to him is a real tragedy. I also have always loved the soundtrack, with Nine Inch Nails, The Cure, Rage Against The Machine, Thrill Kill Kult, and many more. One of the best soundtracks ever put together. This DVD has lots of extras which other people here have already discussed, so I won't elaborate. All I'll say is if you're a fan, buy this -- you won't regret it. And if you haven't seen it, give it a shot. It's well worth your time.
B00190OHD6|5.0|Defiantly a must see you will shed many tears but this is a great movie worth every tear. Everyone deserves to be loved like this!
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|The book Mockingjay meant a lot to me. The whole series made you want to get to know Katniss, Gale, and Peeta. The author Suzanne Collins did a wonderful job bringing the characters to life.
B00AAQRNQ8|4.0|comfortable,  built well, good price.<br /><br />  The maker logo  light I'd the only interchangeable  but that's where you rest your hands on.  Wish there were just a few more buttons.

B0009P5YXO|5.0|This is absolutely FANTASTIC!!!! SO much fun to write with, send secret messages, and the basic pointing and freaking people out with it! LOVE IT! An absolute must for any Whovian. :)
B00B4804KS|5.0|I have been a fan of this film since it was first released in theaters as a teenager.<br /><br />Setting aside the 3D for a moment, the blu-ray is crystal clear, with no visible film degradation at all. The special effects are still stunning to this day. The mix of CGI and animatronics creates a balance of reality few films manage to find. The 3D conversion is quite good. In the scene where the group is watching Hammond on the screen with MR. DNA I was annoyed for a split second by the fact that there were people blocking my view of the screen, only to have reality remind me the characters on the screen are the ones blocking the picture. Obviously the 3D is not absolutely necessary for enjoyment, but it does add another level to watching the film.<br /><br />For those with good sound systems the 7.1 DTS master track is as amazing as I recall from the theaters. It is incredibly satisfying to hear the soft rustling of leaves from the left rear speaker, followed by a chirp from the front right. The visuals may draw you in, but the sound is what brings alive the immersion.<br /><br />Anyone who is a fan of the film should have this on Blu-Ray for the visuals. If you have a strong sound system, the film has never sounded better unless you heard the original DTS track from its theatrical release in 1993. If you also happen to have a 3D setup, this movie belongs in your collection.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|It is a non-violent dragon game where you make your own dragon park on your own island. You can get awesome legendary dragons, like the sun and moon.You can get more than one island. If you love dragons, I highly recommend getting this app.
B0054SMIH6|4.0|Great movie. Entertaining, captivating plot, humor when you need it. Gives good insight into the minds of lawyers. Definite recommendation!

B0096YJDNQ|4.0|Not being an astronomer I find it a bit over my head and not easy to manipulate.  Provides plenty of information I'm just not familiar with the subject.  ON the hand as I play with it more I am learning about our starry universe.  Great graphics.
B00992CF6W|5.0|It could have a update like weather effects like rain it just needs a few more improvements Mojang its a small world but exciting this time! Good luck miners!
B004EFYZ1C|5.0|To think our ancestors built pyramids to study the moon cycles, to see where in the horizon the moon would rise and set.  The waxing, weaning moon that we have set world calendars by, religious holidays, pagan worship rituals and Easter in Christ doctrine calendars.  Swear not by the moon, the inconstant moon.  I love this app. I wish it had more history and lore available on the site.  Go outside with your kindle and turn it on, wonder, and ponder it all.
B000UZQI0Q|4.0|To its credit I do not know where the series is headed. This book got a little long in the middle but picked up at the end. It has a satisfying ending that still leaves me wanting to read more.
B0057UA486|5.0|This film is visually stunning.  The Irish country side. The red coats and blue coats arrayed against each other. And it is very slow paced. I think the slow pace gives us the feeling of living in the film. The days when communication was not instantaneous. When a night of cards was all the rage and what people did. And I never could figure out if Ryan O'neal was acting or if he was as shallow as his character Barry Lyndon. And as in all Kubrick films the music is an integral part of the film. The technical aspects of the film, when he used a special camera to film by candlelight. Magnificent. Do not expect a lot of action and don't watch this movie if you are tired.  It WILL put you to sleep.  But that does not mean it is not one of my favorite films.
B00881PTRC|2.0|It appears to be a good hangman app but it is significantly more than 30 MB in size.  It was one of my 5 largest apps installed.  The other hangman that I had installed is one of my smaller apps installed and plays hangman fine.  Ultimate Hangman HD has been removed from my Fire.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This game is great. I loved the first temple run but the second one is fantastic. I love the zip line and other new features.
B004BLDD9Y|2.0|I don't have any issues with the product quality, but very dis satisfied with customer service. Bought few of these in one lot. Obviously, used them as and when a bulb needed change, so used last one after about 4 months. Found it to be dead upon opening. Amazon referred me to manufacturer, manufacturer promised to get back to me, but no reply so far. Finding a $10 product DOA is quite frustrating experience.
1616550414|4.0|I have always loved The Legend Zelda games. They have always been full of adventure, danger, excitement, and puzzles! This book is a great compilation of facts about the games, characters, artwork, timelines, and the history of the Legend of Zelda. This book is a fantastic addition to any Legend of Zelda lover's library. There was only two issues that I had with it.<br /><br />I had two issues with this book. The first is that I would have liked to have seen a lot more historical facts about the games. Link's Awakening, The Adventure of Link, Majora's Mask, The Legend of Zelda, and all the others, are only reserved about two to three pages of facts and history. Each paragraph and picture has a lot of empty space in between them. I would have liked to have seen a lot more history on the specific dungeons, areas of the map and puzzles. Specifically Link's Awakening because that's my personal favorite.<br /><br />The other issue that I saw was that they didn't include the game maps in the book! Each game has a specific map. They do include some areas of the map, and what the area looks like in a computerized 3D view, but not the full map of what it looks like when you press START on your game console. I would have really liked to have seen that for nostalgia.<br /><br />Besides those two things, I really do enjoy reading this book. It's a great addition to any Legend of Zelda collection.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|I love this show. It's right up there with Law and Order. The story line is very interesting and keeps you coming back for more.
B002ZB26AO|5.0|This is an excellent read for anyone interested in the North Korean lifestyle. I read this book in just a few sittings and found it fascinating. The book ends in 2009. I wish the author would give an update.
B009ZQ8FQG|2.0|Got into Downtown even though after viewing the first show,  I questioned myself. Now, after the end of season 3 and the death of Matthew, I 'm done.
B001KDQ4KQ|5.0|It was a very riveting story and well written. Highly recommend for anyone who enjoys a great love story with great characters.
B00CDT41RY|5.0|Really surprised by this movie. Didn't expect such a good movie with offensives content but the story and action were excellent. Watched it twice and plan to watch it again.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I found it difficult to put this book down- suspense, mind-numbing sex, and  humor-this story has it all. The only deficit relating to this story is waiting  for the next book, Entwined with you.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|The show is great but the Amazon site to locate the season or episode you want is terrible.  You need to take some lessons from netflix.  on Amazon I have to start from scratch ever time.  It doesn't keep track of what I've watched or what would be the next episode.  I like your products and the selection.  You need to seriously improve the customer interface.
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|It was a good read.  Hard to put down.  Suspense and mystery.  A recommended book to read if you have time.

B00785P2QC|5.0|The game is a lot of fun. Brings you something to do for at least a week. Hope they improve it a bit in the future. To be more sim city like. Overall game have a nice music and sounds..
B00AMBK0X4|1.0|First of all, let me just say that I a DO like Family Guy and American Dad.  I also like R rated comedies and am not offended by \\"too much vulgar language\\". But I did hate this movie.  I laughed not once. Mark's character was a total loser with the only redeeming quality being that he looked like Mark Wahlberg. So all was forgiven. And Ted was just annoying and selfish. And worse of all... NOT funny.<br /><br />Look, I can see that I'm in the majority here, but I like to laugh as well, and found nothing to laugh at watching this film.  No story and too long.
0062238868|5.0|this was for my 16 year old son. He loves it !  He's not a big reader, but he has barely put this one down :)
B001AEF6D6|5.0|The Big Lebowski is an outstanding film from the Coen Brothers.  Given only modest reviews by Main Stream Media court-reviewers it has since become a cult classic.<br /><br />The movie picks up on a Baby Boomer theme also described in Forrest Gump, that perhaps the way to achieve a spiritual mastery is no through active efforts-but passive ones.  Forrest Gump himself is stupid but goes through life as a sort of dull witted Caine in Kung Fu-he helps people, spiritually, materially, and physically by not over-thinking.  Forrest Gump can't over-think as he is dumb, but Lebowski is perfectly capable mentally but has no ambition.  Like Kung Fu's Caine however, he helps others with their problems...to a point.<br /><br />We meet Lebowski, or \\"The Dude\\" at the onset of the Gulf War.  He is beaten by toughs, one of whom, a Chinaman, pees on his rug.  This sets of a chain of events where the Dude meets a producer of pornographic films, a Republican Reaganite Millionaire-the other Lebowski, a modern art feminist painter, and \\"The Jesus.\\"<br /><br />John Goodman plays Walter Sobchak, a Shabbes Goy American and Nam Vet.  In many ways this character is a personification of many of the former Reagan Republican foreign policies as they were forming into Neo-conservatism the 1990's. Walter Sobchak is aggressive, overbearing, takes great faith in simple solutions, but is lacking nuance and judgment.<br /><br />The Dude abides through the entire movie, tying up loose ends throughout...sort of.  An ironic look at LA, America, and the endgame of the Hippie revolution.
B00196YNWU|1.0|I love the movie, Annie.  Purchased it for my granddaughters.  This was not the HD version, however, the film was so dark it was hard to see anything on the screen.  Needless to say, the girls lost interest and didn't want to watch the movie.
1892005034|5.0|I bought this book about a year ago to understand how to communicate in my relationship. I now fully integrate  the teachings in this book in all parts of my life(at least I try to). This book has allowed me to move about the world with confidence and calmness when before I often felt anxious and self-conscious when I interacted with my partner, my students, my family, my friends and my co-workers.  I now feel like I have the tools not only to communicate and listen but to give myself compassion and empathy.  I more fully understand a healthier and peace-creating way to see myself and others.
B007W1BLN0|5.0|I would never do what Christopher McCandless did, and yet I found Into the Wild to be incredibly inspiring. The filming of nature is beautiful. The film is 2 hours and 45 minutes long but it kept me captivated. Hard to believe he was able to survive with so little knowledge of living in the wilderness.
B005IQZB14|5.0|This book was fast paced and well written.  I read it in two sittings.  If you're looking for a read that is at times both depressing and empowering, this is it!  Like a roller coaster without being extreme in either direction.
B008Y73940|5.0|Very good movie...long but worth it.  All of the actors did a great job.  Nice ending.  I really enjoyed it.
1476715904|2.0|As many folks do, I always read at least a few reviews before purchasing a book.  And I tend to just throw out the five stars and the one stars and try to rely on the ones more in the middle.  But as of this writing, this book has 1,151 five-star reviews, and I am flummoxed.  I can't for the life of me figure out how it got so skewed to the five-star.<br /><br />I finished the book yesterday, and felt compelled to write a review.  I don't review very many books that I read, and I typically do so when I've either LOVED it or HATED it.  Slammed falls just above \\"hated.\\"  It's definitely not the worst book I've ever read, but I certainly cannot, for the life of me, figure out how any literate person can say it was the best book ever.<br /><br />I don't really want to repeat everything that's already been said by one- and two-star reviewers, but a couple of things seem to bear repeating.  The story is interesting; it held my attention throughout.  I did not, as some reviewers, find it boring.  The characters are reasonably well developed.  I assume it was the author's intention for the main character to come across as immature and bratty. If so, she succeeded.  I enjoyed the slam poetry (I'm a fan of slam poetry) even though it was definitely not the best I've ever read.  I was not annoyed by the lyrics to the Avett Brothers music at the beginning of each chapter.  I didn't see much relation to the content of the chapter, so I just skimmed it.<br /><br />Here's my BIG problem!  Finally, you may say.  I am usually pretty good at employing my willing suspension of disbelief -- but this book just sent me over the top with its lack of plausibility.  SPOILER here:  Will is a \\"student teacher.\\"  Okay, I know nothing about the preparation of teachers or the teaching profession in Michigan, where the novel is set.  Obviously, it is SIGNIFICANTLY different than that found in Texas (which is where the author lives).  One of the concerns when Will decides to quit is his loss of income.  At least in Texas, student teachers do NOT get paid.  Also in Texas, student teachers are supervised by a mentor teacher on campus and by a university supervisor who makes visits.  Didn't see that in Slammed.<br /><br />In Texas (again, where the author lives), an inappropriate relationship between a teacher and a student is a felony, punishable by JAIL TIME, not just the threat of losing the position.  These unbelievable inconsistencies are just rampant in the book, so I'll stop listing them here.  I've only touched the surface.<br /><br />Other reviewers have commented on the speed with which the two characters \\"fall in love.\\"  That's probably my biggest issue with implausibility.  They fall madly in love after one date in the course of one week -- during which the fact that he's a university student doing his student teaching at the local high school OR the fact that she is, indeed, a high school student never comes up. Seriously? Nope, just doesn't work for me.<br /><br />Maybe my expectations were too high.  I guess I didn't fully realize that the book is intended to be in the Young Adult genre.  But, regardless, as a former high school teacher, I've read MUCH really good YA literature; Slammed is NOT good YA literature.
B00ADS98FC|4.0|Just a nice, light, enjoyable musical comedy that really hit all the right notes:)  The performances were really impressive, especially in the time they had to put them together.
B005PK57NU|5.0|This show is consistently one of my favorites.  A lot of shows hit a lull around this time, but &#34;The Good Wife&#34; avoids this by finally confronting the problems looming over Will.  Love it!
B00BOLE7X0|4.0|Good in an esoteric way.  My twelve-year-olds had some trouble following it.  If you want something different and more stimulating, give it a go....Oh, and Sally Field was awesome.
B0000033IR|5.0|Aretha Franklin's third Atlantic album in less than two years is another classic. The lady of soul is at her best.
B00AN0KBJC|5.0|Read all the books twice and I still enjoyed watching the performance...which is often not the case.  Wish HBO would get their act together and extract themselves from solely distributing via cable subscription.  How last millennium!
B000002IHD|5.0|Otis Redding's third album includes hits from his all time idol Sam Cooke who had died the previous November. A classic
B00009ZYBY|5.0|love this movie, well why wouldin't you love it when Russell Crowe is the lead star.  YOu are sure to really like this movie, the end is really neat when he meets his wife & child
B00BSBT8M6|5.0|Just fun.The boy actor that plays young Pi is fantastic.Will become one of my favorite movies of all.Must see for all.
B008133MDK|5.0|I started watching this after I finished reading all the Sherlock Holmes books and after watching Guy Richie's movies. I was reluctant to watch these because I didn't want to get 'sucked in' to a TV series and I couldn't see how they could possibly put Sherlock Holmes into modern day time period and make it work. But, it was free with Amazon Prime and I needed a show to fall asleep to. Well, let's just say I haven't slept much over the last couple of weeks! I couldn't stop watching, and am really sad to have finished all 6 episodes already. The quality is amazing: I kept thinking, this is NOT a TV show, this is a movie -- no wonder they only do 3 per season. The cinematography is beautiful, the acting/character development is great. Most of all, I am impressed with how well the stories have translated to modern day time. The clever changes (from Watson being a writer to a blogger, for example) work incredibly well. I can't wait for season 3!
B00APUQH0W|4.0|Good sports movie.  I would recommend if you like Baseball movies.  Better than some others I have seen.  Clint Eastwood is Clint Eastwood.
0446576220|5.0|Watch out...this book is inspiring enough to make you want to take the Zappos company tour when you are in Vegas.<br />I did yesterday, met the wonderfully wacky, fun and empowered Zappos employees, and saw for myself that they &#34;walk-the-talk&#34;. The book will help you rethink how you work and how you live.
B00BLCHYKU|4.0|Great show & plot so far. I am currently watching Epidode 3 and can't get enough. Thanks to the History Channel for a wonderful show & cast.
0312641893|4.0|good book, SPOILER ALERT ,cinder isn't an average girl, she is part robot,he life is almost normal for the most part she works as a mechanic and lives her life until one day a prince comes to have her fix his android, just as a plague breaks out, her life then completely changes, her stepmother evilly commits cinder to testing for the plague cure (no one ever survived this) after one of her step sisters come into contact with the plague after being with cinder in a junk yard, from there she finds a whole new identity and eventually captures the heart of the prince. her problems seem to look up until the arrival of an evil queen from another planet, and the disastrous reveal of her robot parts...............so that's a general over view read it its good!
B009IJJB8G|5.0|This show continues to have great character development with witty interplay between the characters. The writing is really well done and the chemistry between Holmes and Watson is amazing.
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|This is a fast paced game, that requires your full concentration to beat your previous scores each time.  Very fun.
B004SRPXWQ|4.0|nice program.  While it was rated free, to eliminate ads and safeguard my kids, I purchased the .99 version.  great fun for the kids and adult to have some clean and interactive fun with.
B007URVZJ6|5.0|I absolutely loved this book!  I found it very helpful in my pursuit of learning how to correctly format and upload my books on Kindle.  It walks you through the steps simply and easily.  It is well written and easy to understand.  I recommend this book to anyone and everyone who is seeking help in this area.
B0094M4R3Q|5.0|This is a great movie for the family - even grandma got caught-up in the movie!!<br />The movie is smart, teaches the importance of education and shows a little girl being smart, strong and courageous.
B00B69UQEO|4.0|It has some good songs that's why I only give it 4 stars and because I prefer their older songs .
B000021XS0|5.0|In my opinion, Metropolis Part 2 is one of the best albums of all time. It is an amazing release that is largely unknown by the majority of rock listeners. It is a testament to Dream Theater's otherworldly musicianship. A masterpiece and a must have!
B004H4XAXO|5.0|Loved the development of characters, politics, mystery and a whole new magic system - this is addictive.  The problem will be waiting for the next installments.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I was caught up in the story almost from the beginning.  Good story written well .  Would definitely read this author again and soon.<br />.
1451696191|5.0|I am a really fast reader and i couldn't put this book down. the pace is excellent and i suggest buying this book for yourself.
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|It's fun and it;s easy to play.  I like the way you can manipulate the tiles.  I like Mahjong, especially on the computer.
B004FGMDOQ|5.0|I really enjoyed this particular book because it was extremely exciting and I was just about as surprised as ever to read this book. I greatly enjoyed this book. I hope you did/ do too!
B000FA675C|5.0|I have the hard copy of the book.  I have read it six times.  Thoroughly enjoy the detail, in depth historical parts as well as the intensity.  So glad that I could download it on my Kindle.  Now I can take it with me anywhere and read, read, read.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This was a simply spectacular book! I really liked it, the movie was great as well. I hope you read this book too!
B0089LOKHG|2.0|Looked forward to this book for ONE YEAR, and I couldnt believe what a letdown it was. How could the same author have written both delirium and requiem????
B006LSZECO|3.0|This story contains a dark psychological plot - contains absolutely no joy, light or humor.  An almost &#34;tedious&#34; read with a disappointing conclusion.
B005DNPKSQ|5.0|Excellent, but sad movie. Good for Philosophy. I really enjoyed this move. Although sad, its one of Jim Carrey's best.
B000XUBF3I|5.0|This book by Marla Cilley is great.  It explains her system of cleaning house by deviding chores into 15 minutes at a time.  I have struggled with cleaning house all my life.  Marla makes it easy and fun.  I would recommend this book to anyone who would like cleaning house to be easier than ever before.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Love the characters and they way the show &#34;flows&#34;....I fell in love with the people of Downton the first time I watched it.  Keeps you guessing at every turn.  I adore Maggie Smiths character, wish they would give her more storyline!
B00AYB1RGG|5.0|This movie was fantastic. I did not want it to end. I want more. I would recommend it to anyone.
B005NKGEP2|4.0|After having lived abroad as an expat myself, I understand the many trials and tribulations one runs into when trying to adapt into a new country with different customs and culture. I empathized with the heroine and her struggles to adapt in her new land. I enjoyed the flashbacks between present and past, keeping the reader guessing until the very end on what was really happening. I've recommended to other readers knowing they'll enjoy the suspense.
B0084IG8TM|5.0|The Hunger Games movie is based on the novel of the same title by Suzanne Collins. The screenplay follows the book quite faithfully for the most part. Jennifer Lawrence does a sterling job as Katniss Everdeen, Peeta Mellark is well portrayed by Josh Hutcherson and Aussie actor Liam Hemsworth does a great rendition of Gale Hawthorne. A few screen veterans add to the overall enjoyment: Donald Sutherland is very convincing as President Snow; Woody Harrelson plays an excellent Haymitch; Effie Trinket is superbly acted by Elizabeth Banks and a surprisingly good Lenny Kravitz plays Cinna. Even the minor characters are convincing. The sets, setting and location make for an outstanding screen experience and the wardrobe and make-up are a marvel, especially the citizens of the Capitol. Special effects and computer graphics make for a stunning result. Brilliant direction by Gary Ross: an excellent experience all round. The second disc in this DVD set has interviews with producers, director, cast & crew, as well as behind the scenes clips.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|It is really fun to follow the character development. Each of them is not perfect, but likable and believable. Even some hard to believe &#34;happy end&#34;ings do not spoil the series.
B00881PTRC|4.0|I only played a couple rounds of the game. Game is very &quot;clean&quot; funtionally, easy to know what to do next. Cute animated graphics. No bugs or unexpected behavior in the brief time I played.<br /><br />That said, I would be bored to tears playing this alone! I hoped to play online with my friends. Unfortunately the two-player option is only for two people using the same phone.<br /><br />As a wannabe computer programmer, I am pleased and impressed with this game. As a real user, I just don't have any use for it.<br /><br />As said in my title, this would be a great diversion when waiting with kids in a doctor's office or similar situation.
B00AB0Z88S|5.0|I knew there would be some neat effects, but never imagined what would happen when we played this movie on our 3D TV.  The story is good and the graphics and 3D effects knock you right out of your seat.  What a fun experience right in your own home.  So glad I bought it.
B002NT3B52|3.0|Really just mostly an observaiton of how dogs see the world.  Do not expect to learn a lot about how to train your dog but more of a dogs view of the world. Interesting read.
B00AZL3PBK|3.0|This is a cute game, a lot like mario bros but a bit different, like characters and graphics. Still fun and challenging. Great for any age!
B00AF6MF9I|4.0|I like gameloft. I have a lot of games from game loft. I like this app more than some others but you do have to wait for a lot of things. execept for that, this game is awesome<br />for 4 stars
B002U0KHMY|5.0|Yes, I bought this as a gift, and the recipient loves it. I've watched some of it myself. Nice show. I may not love it as much as my sister, but hey... as a gift my opinion doesn't matter so much as her's.
B000SEFM6K|5.0|I have been reading quite a lot of classic English novels over the past year, and discovered this book on an internet list somewhere or the other.  From what I read, Wilkie Collins was a friend and contemporary of Charles Dickens, but I personally had never heard of him before.  He was quite popular, perhaps more popular than Dickens, but alas, his fame has not lasted.<br /><br />I started the book, expecting a bit of a slog - as I find some of Dickens books to be, but was very pleasantly surprised at what an easy, readable style this book is written in.  The book is a series of narratives, written from the recollections of many of the primary characters, though mostly from the point of view of the young drawing instructor who happens on the Woman in White, late one night on his way back to London. This book has it all; the innocent young heiress, the fortune seeking lord, a mysterious Italian Count, and more.  It is a book that quite instantly grabs your attention and keeps it.  Like Dickens, great characters, plenty of adventure and a bit of social commentary all mixed in.<br /><br />I highly recommend!
B0089LOKHG|2.0|This book had so much promise. It just fell flat. Nothing was resolved. What happened to Hannah? Julian? Who knows? Alex was barely in it. The whole series just suffered from a lack of stakes. People just kept living or coming back from the dead. Alex should have stayed dead. There is no way the govt would have left him alive. Lena's mom should have stayed dead. Pippa should have stayed dead. I just got so sick of everyone coming back. This is war. People die and not in the lackluster, rushed way that Raven did. Barely getting a paragraph. This book just suffered from the author's inability to let go of her characters and let them face the realistic consequences of their decisions. It made me want to rewrite the book to give it a truly satisfying ending. This series was a waste of time and money because it left me so unsatisfied.
B000JCQCW4|5.0|Even though this movie is kinda old, I stillll love it! This was the first movie that I'd ever seen that used several cluster shots & sounds to describe a scene rather than shoot it in 2 minutes. I love that about this movie. It's super intense!!!
B008JAGZDE|4.0|This movis is hilarious! I recommend it to those who seen the triolgy and sequels to it. Check it out.
B001DM1VXE|1.0|I tried to watch it but it's way to black and white for me. Starts out slow so I didn't even finish it.
B00C1BU7V8|1.0|I was extremely disappointed with this movie. It was too political and did not really delve into who Lincoln was as a person. The set was extremely dark. I understand this was done to represent the time period but it made it difficult for viewing.  I would have liked to have seen more of a story line about his childhood and family background so I could understand  what made Lincoln the man he became. Also, I would have liked to have seen more about the relationships between Lincoln and his wife and children.
B001AH6ZWY|4.0|I liked this movie, it is an older movie but for UFO buff's like me it brings a little &#34;what if&#34; to the genre...
B003U51EE8|4.0|This is a  was great show love watching it can't wait to see season 4 hope it's as good as this one.
B00A0SLTCU|5.0|A whole lot more action than the Original Total Recall even when they were pretty close to the original story.
B0036JU6CY|5.0|One of the best martial arts movies of all times. This movie covers the span of a young man's life from being orphaned to studying the art of ninjutsu, he soon learns of his master's treacherous and murderous plots and refuses to partake of them. He fights his ninja brethren & master in the end!
B00BKTFABE|3.0|It's hard to get a subject other than yourself, but that's the way Kindle is made. The camera eye is on the front. Just have to work with it.
B00BR4QNJ0|5.0|A very intuitive use of tower defense while retaining an action feel. Found myself deeply enjoying this game. Great job guys.
B00BHHIWQO|3.0|Not a total brain buster, but I guess it's similar to Candy Crush which is all the rage. It's worth checking out, I know kids would definately like it.
B004SRPXWQ|4.0|my son loves it and plays it all of the time..<br />do wish it did more for free, but is worth the little money to keep upgrading..
B000FA675C|5.0|I've read this before but I love having it on my Kindle. Loved the movie, love the book more. Great.
B00BDSRISA|5.0|I honestly first discovered this band from their previous landmark album \\"Wolfgang Amadeus Phoenix.\\"  They had this unique, yet familiar sound that was nearly irresistible.  I even went back to their older albums to see what I missed out on.  How their song \\"If I Ever Feel Better\\" wasn't a worldwide mega hit is beyond me!  But again, Wolfgang seemed to be the bands magnum opus so far and people had very high expectations for what would follow.  I did too, but I remembered that having expectations usually leads to letdowns.  So I went into this new album \\"Bankrupt\\" with an open mind just so I could enjoy the music.  It was just good to hear new music from \\"Phoenix\\"!  They aren't the only French band who have been receiving some attention.  \\"Daft Punk\\" have grown and grown in popularity with each year, and another awesome band is \\"M83\\" who is also gaining momentum.  Now \\"Phoenix\\" is back in the spotlight too and hopefully this album helps them stay there.  So here's a track by track breakdown.<br /><br />1.  Entertainment:  The lead single off the album that most people have heard.  It hasn't received the popularity that \\"1901\\" and \\"Lisztomania\\" did but I still loved the vibe of this song.  The guitars and synths that the song revolves around sounds like a 80's song in Asia.  You will hear a lot of sounds similar to the 80's era of music on this album.  I always think of being in some big Asian city or Beach when listening to this song.  Nice catchy song that grows with each listen.<br />2.  The Real Thing:  Nice groovy song all the way through.  Though there isn't really a catchy hook, the song as a whole is beautiful.  There are so many layers in this song you could miss out on depending on how you listen to it.  The song ends abruptly though.  Gets me every time.<br />3.  S.O.S. In Bel Air:  Nice upbeat song that just makes you feel good!  This is also definitely one of the experimental songs.  It sounds like two different songs mushed together in a awesome way!  One part of the song has this build up to it that will give many listeners a hype feeling.  Then there's the part of the song with the infectious 80s influenced synths.  This song is awesome to say the least.<br />4.  Trying To Be Cool: My personal favorite song on the album!  This song is GROOVY.  Again there's a slight 80's feel to it.  This is pure \\"Phoenix\\".  The guitars, synths, drums and awesome french accented vocals compliment each other so magically.  I can totally see this song being a huge hit.  I can't get over how perfect this song is!  Listen to it loud and with good earphones.  Blast it in your car while cruising through the night!<br />5.  Bankrupt:  Awesome beat buildups and synths.  Partially instrumental and partially vocalized.  2 minutes into the song it turns into something that sounds like it came out of the \\"Tron: Legacy\\" soundtrack by Daft Punk.  Truthfully this song sounds like Phoenix was listening to \\"M83\\" and \\"Daft Punk\\" while making this album.  This track is nearly 7 minutes long.  Some will get bored by it, and some will love it's experimental layers.  The vocals really add to the song toward the end.  The ending is really relaxing and peaceful.  I personally love the entire song.<br />6.  Drakkar Noir:  I first heard this played live combined with the song \\"Trying to be Cool\\" and seriously thought this was part of that song.  I honestly think this is my second favorite song on the album.  It's playful and awesome.  The vocals have that \\"Phoenix\\" spice to it.  I love every single layer in this song.  More listens might make this my favorite song eventually.  Around 2 minutes into the song be prepared to be blown away even more!<br />7.  Chloroform:  This is my third favorite.  OH MY GOD.  So amazing.  This song is relaxing.  I will again compare the sound to \\"Daft Punk\\" and \\"M83\\" with the Phoenix spice!  Not enough can be said about how beautiful this song is.  I can tell this album will make me switch between which tracks are my favorite.<br />8.  Don't:  This song gets me emotionally for some reason.  It's not even slow.  It just makes me reflect for some reason.  I love it.  Phoenix are truly magical like that.  The synths are awesome and pulsing during the chorus.  Great catchy upbeat song to nod your head to.<br />9.  Bourgeois:  The 80s are being channeled once again bigtime on this amazing synth-filled chill song.  I've said it multiple times in this review, but again I have to say this might eventually become my favorite track.  This song has this vibe that makes me wanna drive down a long road during the sunset.  This song glides along and I will definitely have this on mega replay.<br />10.  Oblique City:  Of course they end the album with a bang.  The synths on this song AGAIN have that \\"Phoenix\\" 80s vibe.  This song is so fun and playful.  Like the other songs, this is best enjoyed with earphones!<br /><br />Truth be told, unlike some of the other reviewers, I loved this album to death and I will continue obsessing over it.  Not trying to compare it to \\"Wolfgang\\" but I honestly enjoyed this album more than that one.  There is not a single weak track on this album in my opinion.  All of the songs are hits for me!  Maybe it's just because it's brand new.  I don't know.  All I know is that this album has ultimate replay value.  Some people are even saying this album is a setback for Phoenixs career.  I strongly disagree.  I can tell this album will be a huge critical and commercial success.  Phoenix deserves all the fame and acclaim they are getting and so much more!  If you like great, catchy, and just genius music then look no further than this nearly perfect album.  This is a perfect summer album too just like most of Phoenixs work!  If you're interested, the deluxe edition contains over 70 demo tracks on a bonus disc.  Just saying.  Now excuse me while I jam out to this album.
B003LQ3YXU|5.0|I LOVE THE DOCTOR! If you have found that you truely love the doctor, then you will want to know all the back story you can. David Tennant was my first Doctor, but I have found that it's The Doctor I Love, and I want to know all I can about him. These are great to watch. I am completely mesmerized with how I can go and watch older shows and find out sooo much more than I thought would even be there. Example: Bad Wolf, when I started with David Tennant I thought Bad Wolf was one thing, then all through watching the first season I was guessing...this is Bad Wolf, no this is. Then WA-Bam.... No freakin' way that's Bad Wolf. So, well made and I watch them over and over. When I say 'Well Made' I'm saying for the time they were made. The pixels are off for our newer TV. For me it doesn't matter, I still watch B&W shows. Love that I can watch on PRIME, and am collecting the DVD's just in case, for the future.
B009NG1Q96|4.0|Can't wait for book 3!!!!<br /><br />Loved loved loved it!!!! But pretty mad a Maxon I have to say and please I beg Keira Cass get the 3rd book out SOON!!!
B005HED11Y|5.0|Amazon prime delivers. Star Trek. I really can't remember the quality when I watched the series for the first time. I was enthralled by the stories. As a SF geek, I knew that the show's writers were awesome.  Now I can appreciate the HD quality as well. These remastered originals are in letterbox format and have been digitally enhanced. Such things as the starships, planetary and deep space backgrounds are much more detailed. The main and hand held phaser blasts are more than just overlayed streaks of color.  I have seen the original Enterprise bridge set at the Smithsonian in DC and all I can say is that the camera hides a lot as what looks pretty cool on a small screen is really hokie in real life. If your a trekkie like me you will not be disappointed.  And, if your not and just enjoy SF you can't go wrong with this start of the SF franchise that's still alive today.
B001KDQ4KQ|4.0|Kept my interest up to the very last page, didn't want to put it down. One of the best I've read by this author.
B0060MYM3S|5.0|I order this for my mom and she loved it as well. I watch it every Sunday on cable so I just got this for my mom.
B000002VSN|5.0|I as a Xmas gift for my mother. She loves it.  She plays it in her car all the time.
B00A1XOPE8|5.0|I always look very much forward to Mr. Sandersons books, and have read every single one of them.<br />This was no disapointment. A new magic-system that was cool, complex and understandable. A plotline that has some twists, something that you exspect and something that leaves you surpriced. I always like how Mr. Sandersons characters are well rounded, and that the villans are not someone who is just bad because he can be, but you get to know everybodys motives and this gives a lot of debth to the story! In adition this novel is very fast paced, and a lot of the chapters ends with cliffhangers, so that you just have to read on! I read it in one setting.<br />This is a short story, at least in comperason to his other books. But it is quite enjoyable and i can not wait to hear more about the Elantris world, where this novel is set.<br />Thank you so much Mr. Sanderson for writing such good books time and time again. I always know that when i sitt there with a new book by you i will have many enjoyable hours before me!
B000JMKRKC|5.0|I absolutely loved this story.  The more I read, the more I became hooked.  Setterfield expertly weaves her tale, and I highly recommend this to anyone interested in really well-written literature.
B002CAWNDS|5.0|A movie to be talked about for years to come. The acting is excellent and the storyline will keep you on the edge of your seat. I'll enjoy watching this over and over again.
B0071XO8RA|4.0|In an age with many apocalyptic type stories around every turn, wool definitely belongs.  A highly interesting world, and I am excited about continuing the series.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|This Hinton game is by far the best most addictive one I have played I just love the challenge and the diff levels
B00881VLCE|2.0|I would have gladly given this app five stars if it wasn't for the annoying pop-ups for Mobicow.com and Ad-Track King that kept interfering with the puzzle I was working on.  Once these started popping up, they wouldn't go away, even when I went completely out then back in again.  So, this app only gets two stars and deletion from my apps.  This app is not worth the frustration of those pop-ups.
B0040I09RM|5.0|Started watching the series. Now we eat, sleep, and drink the Sons. In the Third season and have 2 seasons to go in order to catch up. Thank goodness for Amazon Prime!! I get to watch it for free.
B0059XTV7Q|4.0|I gave it 4 star because it's my kind of movie.<br />Easy to follow, Madonna and crew did a good job
B006VFLIYK|5.0|David Baldacci keeps your interest at all times.  I could not put it down - entertaining to the end as always with his books.
B006FE83V8|5.0|A complete classic, remember reading and watching this in high school.<br />Great characters. Awesome packaging from universal studios. Definitely worth the purchase
B009YP9L7U|5.0|I love a good story with a happy ending, and this one delivers. Great characters who have like troubled childhoods agree to a marriage of convenience, but windup falling in love but fighting their feelings.
B003LQ3YXU|5.0|By far one of the best shows on TV. Creative, funny, witty. BBC once again knocks it out of the park.
B0083ZRAJS|4.0|Good book but leaves you hanging in the end it is a great book I would rate it 4 out of 5 stars
B00BJS7LHC|5.0|High energy movie with awesome humor and action.  Waltz is unbelievable.  Intense depiction of pre-Civil War South presents a whole new understanding of the era.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Season 3 was not as good as season 1 and 2 but it was decent. It lost a little bit of the spitefulness but it was still good. Can't wait for season 4 to come out!!
B00BLCHYKU|5.0|Vikings has some historical basis but is mostly just a story that is Vikings version of the Sopranos.  The main Character is what makes the series with a glassy look in his eyes that is difficult to read what he plans on doing next.  Meanwhile all around him there is constant chaos.  He stays cool during all of the turmoil and continues his well thought out plans.  Great series!!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Great acting, set design, great cast, great music, and great plot. No drugs, sex, or bad language and it is by far the BEST show on TV. I was pleasantly surprised by Downton Abbey!
B0081336FO|5.0|A great twist on a Modern version of Sherlock Holmes.  Sherlock is like Spock from Star Track in this series in that he wants to keep emotion out of the equations.  He understands he is obsessive and cold while still caring far more than he would like.  Excellent series.
B00B4804KS|5.0|The technology involved in making the 1993 2D version of Jurassic Park was pushing the computational and graphics processing boundaries at that time. The results were mind-blowing and box-office busting. So now, you take those effects and transform them into 3D and you have an experience that is nothing short of stunning. The conversion not only added depth, but inserted special effects (like raindrops in the foreground) that were not in the original. And even the sound is enhanced beyond the original.<br />I sure hope that the trilogy is converted so that a pure 3D set becomes available. Jurassic Park, in 3D, is what Steven Spielberg intended all along. What an experience!
B00BF123WG|1.0|This review is not about the movie. It's about streaming it on Amazon Instant Video. The raid scenes are very dark (don't want to give anything away, but at zero dark thirty its dark) and the digital streaming posterized the picture with large swaths of false colors. Totally distracting and kills the suspension of disbelief in a really intense movie. Rent a blue-ray if you really want an immersive HD experience. I have had better luck with Apple TV HD.
B00BVYU2P2|5.0|Takes you right back to high school. Though funny and mostly well-acted, I'm not sure it's to everyone's tastes...but at least worth a watch.
0545265355|5.0|Better than the movie no doubt. I have passed this set on to 2 family members who have enjoyed them and I cannot wait to pass it along to other eager readers.
B00BYKIKJS|4.0|I was worried that, what with all the Oscar nominations, the acting in this film had been over-hyped.  I was wrong, it was fabulous all around, from the leads (Cooper, Lawrence, De Niro & Weaver) to the smaller roles (Chris Tucker, John Ortiz, Julia Stiles, etc...)  When the acting is universally good, you have to give the director some credit.  That said, the story line was more formulaic than I expected and I felt these characters were deserving of a bit &#34;darker&#34; mood, if that makes sense (e.g., Precious), so that their ultimate redemption would be more rewarding.  Instead, the backstory and mental instability that the Cooper and Lawrence characters bring to the table seems misplaced in what is essentially a rom-com.
B00AEFYCL4|5.0|I had to watch this for my Humanities class. The teacher showed us this movie during class time. I was so impacted I decided to purchase the DVD for my own enjoyment. It brings a powerful message about life, and loss, creates terrific discussions.
B00192IOBA|3.0|I bought the album for one song since it was on sale for five bucks. The album overall is mediocre. I didn't even make it through a full pass before I was bored and replayed the one song.  Nice production and all that. Just didn't grab my interest.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|The package arrived in good condition and very timely. The picture and sound of the dvd's played very well. The extras provided some nice, although not extensive clarifications and context.
B00AEUPOVQ|3.0|If you are a big Jane Austen fan you will enjoy this but I found the actors and actresses a little off-putting.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|I must say this is a very interesting movie I enjoyed it a lot. There were unexpected things happen the movie. if they make a sequel I will definitely see it.
B00APUYN0I|4.0|My 12 (almost 13) year old wanted to watch this and I thought it was pretty good but thought some of the scenes were too mature for someone her age.
B005ZTFPFQ|1.0|I grew up in the era where the most advance gaming system was an atari.  Needlessly to say I have fond memories of my atari and playing with friends so when I saw this app I jumped on it.  You get to free games I believe with the download but you have to buy the rest, which is understandable. The problem is it is hard to play the games they have with just a touch screen.  For me, it makes it almost impossible.  So money spent on extra games is money down the drain.  I wouldn't download this app again but to each his own
B009NG1Q96|5.0|I understand your want to have more money. But could you please just get it over with?? I love the book but I NEED to know what happens!!! TEAM MAXON
B002APU580|5.0|I am an avid Jane Austen fan.  Pride and Prejudice along with Mansfield Park happen to be my favorites and thus it is important for a movie to get it right.  We all know and love the BBC 6 part version with Jennifer Ehle and Colin Firth and is the Austen adaptation standard but this version is a pleasant surprise.  I want to clear one thing up before I continue this review.  There have been other viewers who bemoan this version.  They do so on the belief Darcy's first proposal takes place at Pemberley instead of Rosings.  The proposal actually takes place at Rosings if you are paying attention.  Alright, I am off my horse and on to the review.  The cast is exceptional.  The characters are portrayed well  and the chemistry between them is wonderful.  Of course there are characters and subplots that are underdeveloped but you can't expect exact character and subplot representation in a 2 hour movie. Too be honest my only complaint about this version is it just isn't long enough.  I would have loved to see a 6 part version produced with this cast not to replace the BBC version but to compliment it.  I think it would have been brilliant.
B008M7BQHE|5.0|To really enjoy the show, you need to give it your full attention. Otherwise it is easy to miss something important and lose track of what is happening.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|This is a wonderful and touching book.  The power of relationship is so strong and breaks down all barriers.  Broken women can be strong women!
B00196YNWU|4.0|Plenty of music to keep the kids entertained, plus a little humor for adult viewers as well. Watched this one as a kid and was not disappointed to watch again.
0385528752|5.0|Switch: How to Change Things When Change Is Hard by Chip Heath, Dan Heath<br /><br />\\"Switch\\" is the fascinating book about change.  This is a book to help you change things at the individual, organizational, and societal level.  The Heath brothers, Chip and Dan make use of recent psychological case studies and an engaging writing style that not only entertains but provide readers with interesting insights into the psychology of change. This intriguing 320-page book is broken out by the following three sections: Direct the Rider, Motivate the Elephant, and Shape the Path.<br /><br />Positives:<br />1. Engaging, accessible prose on a fascinating topic. Change.<br />2. Interesting case studies that cover a spectrum of the human experience and how it relates to change.<br />3. The authors have a great command of the topic and made it fun for the readers.<br />4. The essence of change, \\"Ultimately, all change efforts boil down to the same mission: Can you get people to start behaving in a new way?\\"<br />5. One of the main ideas of the book is the notion that we have a rational side (Rider) and the emotional side (Elephant).  Taking a page from Jonathan Haidt's popular book The Happiness Hypothesis, the authors drive this analogy throughout the book. \\" If you want to change things, you've got to appeal to both.\\"<br />6. The book is full of interesting facts many of which are counterintuitive.  \\"So when you hear people say that change is hard because people are lazy or resistant, that's just flat wrong. In fact, the opposite is true: Change is hard because people wear themselves out. And that's the second surprise about change: What looks like laziness is often exhaustion.\\"<br />7. Many of the findings of this book are very practical.  \\"If you want people to change, you must provide crystal-clear direction.\\"<br />8. The three-part framework of the book, \\" Direct the Rider, Motivate the Elephant, and Shape the Path.\\" \\"If you can do all three at once, dramatic change can happen even if you don't have lots of power or resources behind you.\\"<br />9. The understanding that big changes can happen despite people having few resources and little structural authority.<br />10. The bright spots... \\"What's working and how can we do more of it?\\" That's the bright-spot philosophy in a single question.\\"<br />11. Understanding decision paralysis.  As Barry Schwartz puts it in his book The Paradox of Choice, as we face more and more options, \\"we become overloaded. Choice no longer liberates, it debilitates. It might even be said to tyrannize.\\"<br />12. The importance of describing a compelling destination. \\"When you describe a compelling destination, you're helping to correct one of the Rider's great weaknesses--the tendency to get lost in analysis.\\"<br />13. The Target case study was very interesting and it provided an interesting change perspective: from ANALYZE-THINK-CHANGE to the more likely SEE-FEEL-CHANGE.<br />14. The great concept of shrinking the change, \\" One way to motivate action, then, is to make people feel as though they're already closer to the finish line than they might have thought.\\"<br />15. Growing your people...\\" It shows us that people are receptive to developing new identities, that identities \\"grow\\" from small beginnings. Once you start seeing yourself as a \\"concerned citizen,\\" you'll want to keep acting like one.\\"<br />16. Tweaking the environment really resonated with me, sound, practical guidelines. \\" Tweaking the environment is about making the right behaviors a little bit easier and the wrong behaviors a little bit harder. It's that simple.\\"<br />17. The two strategies to shaping the path.  \\"(1) tweaking the environment and (2) building habits.\\"<br />18. The power of the herd, \\"In situations where your herd has embraced the right behavior, publicize it. For instance, if 80 percent of your team submits time sheets on time, make sure the other 20 percent knows the group norm.\\"<br />19. The essence of change, \\"Change isn'tan event; it's a process.\\"<br />20. An excellent appendix that ties everything together.<br />21. A short but excellent suggested reading list.<br /><br />Negatives:<br />1. Light on neuroscience.  The authors purposely intended this book to be for the layperson.<br />2. I'm a little skeptical at the end results of some of the cases.<br />3. I would have preferred better terms than Elephant and Rider.  Yes on the concept but the terms were lacking.<br />4. Kindle didn't link notes.<br /><br />In summary, this book was a lot of fun to read.  It provided countless cases of interest and the research provided was insightful and surprisingly practical.  Much of what I have learned from this book can be applied not only to my personal life but to my work.  If you want to learn what it takes to make a change then by all means get this book, I highly recommend it!<br /><br />Further suggestions: \\"[[ASIN:1400069289 The Power of Habit: Why We Do What We Do in Life and Business]]\\" by Charles Duhigg, \\"[[ASIN:1594484805 Drive: The Surprising Truth About What Motivates Us]]\\" by Daniel H.

B00991TCOG|5.0|Such a great sound, just the right mix of dubstep and energetic violin. The insert has some background on a few songs. I've been listening at work and while traveling the past couple months and I still want to listen to this CD. There's absolutely no track that I'd skip and I can't be happier with Lindsey Stirling's album. I'm ready to get another CD as a gift - I don't know who for, but I'll find someone!

B005S9EKCW|5.0|I loved the movie. I've seen the stage production many times, and the movie ranks right up there with them. Each time you see the story you get a different aspect of it. I thoroughly enjoyed watching it. The cast did a wonderful job.
B00AEFY3DQ|5.0|My wife hates this movie because after I had surgery I watched this over and over on VHS...yes VHS! So years later after all our VCR's and VHS tape were gone she got me the Blu-ray!

B000E0W24S|1.0|These recordings, and this conductor, have acquired a kind of halo over time that makes it hard for music lovers to retain a bit of common sense, and indeed to judge these performances on what they actually deliver. In part this happens because the words \\"great conductor\\" are pronounced without the ancillary issue being considered - is he also a \\"great interpreter\\"? Let's not beat about the bush now: If total professionalism was the sole criterion of importance, then how could anyone deny that Ormandy, 50 years at the helm of the Philadelphia Orchestra, must be one of the two or three greatest conductors in history!?<br />I put this rhetorical question to you for the sake of perspective. Mravinsky was certainly a superb conductor, perhaps better said drillmaster - of his orchestra. But although I've auditioned a fair swag of his recordings (of which most are public performances anyway), I cannot discern a great Interpreter. He has a habit of sacrificing meaning to \\"objective\\" criteria, sometimes to the point of fanaticism. It may be what the regime demanded as a virtue of social realism, but that's not an excuse for his stone-cold execution of a score. Sometimes outstanding performances result quasi as a \\"collateral effect\\" of his hard driving. But this is exceptional. Mostly I feel dismay at the end of one of his concerts, because the excitement he conveys is visceral, and this one gets used and then it subsides. But of depth, authentic feeling, let alone caressing music that demands it, there is not a trace.<br />These Tchaikovsky recordings are accurate mirrors of his predilections. They are raw, the orchestra is pushed to extremes, the rhythms remind one more of Le Sacre than Tchaikovsky, the trumpets blare like denizens of hell. And now the point is that the \\"great conducting\\" cannot actually be heard, you hear an orchestra, and it does not reflect what you might mean by \\"great conducting\\". Moreover this ain't no Chicago Symphony or Berlin Philharmonic! It sounds more as if time and again they're in a panic.<br />So I question the appellation \\"great performances\\". I know a great performance when I hear it, and if I were to put the question in all earnestness to you, I suspect you would say the same. So this is not a great performance; it is an occasion of great visceral excitement, and that's the end of it. If you are at all in tune with Tchaikovsky, you'll enjoy it maybe 3-4 times, then enough! Better turn to a more modern recording, and there are plenty. So as not to evince prejudice for the West, let me point to Svetlanov, Kondrashin, Gergiev, Pletnev - all Russians, all passionately involved with Tchaikovsky, and their orchestras sound infinitely better.<br />But if the lure of dubious fame attracts you, by all means try it out. But don't complain when you get sick of this exaggerated and out of character wildness. Tchaikovsky was far too sophisticated for this kind of interpretation to be \\"right\\". So this is occasion to thank heaven for the many other versions available which convey a love for the composer's music, rather than draw total attention to the performers alone!ds more as if time and again they're in a panic.<br />So I question the appellation \\"great performances\\".

B00B2V66VS|5.0|Ok, so i can't play it as good as my grandkids, my 7 yr old grandson loves it. I'm only 55 not 100 i should be able to do this. Its fun though
B007WPM4P0|4.0|I really enjoyed this 2 part series. It is slow in some parts, but is a good mix of an emotional portrayal of life during World War I as a soldier and the horrible conditions of battle and the yearning a of a love affair that keeps soldiering on in the face of such despair.<br /><br />Eddie Redmayne is easy on the eyes and there are a couple of saucy scenes that are tastefully done in keeping with the period.<br /><br />If you can get through the lags in the storyline, it is worth a lazy Sunday with a cup of tea. Has a Masterpiece Theatre feel to it.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|This as been an amazing season. Keeps you on the edge of your seAt Wonderig what will come next. New characters and new location. You will not be able to stop watching.
B0018LX9T4|4.0|Pretty sexy if you like that sort of thing.  Both actors were good choices.<br />Based upon a very short story that isn't nearly as compelling or as well fleshed-out.  In fact, it's rather depressing compared to this.
B007ZGO7EM|1.0|DO NOT  GET  THIS APP IT DOES NOT GIVE YOU  WHAT IT SHOW I AM GOING TO DELET IT  I WOULD NOT GET IT  ANY  BODY  can make awards on anything you make for people want to by it I would not get this app
B008673ZAQ|5.0|The ups and downs that Sylvia makes the characters go through is amazing.  Know that these ups and downs could happen in real life especially in such a high profile couple.  There are times when you love the characters and times when you hate them for what they do to each other but the ending is perfect.  Can't wait to see what happens next in Gideon and Eva's lives.
0307165485|5.0|I bought this book for my Mom for her birthday just because of the poem Elsie Marley. She used to read it to me as a kid ALL the time. So glad to find a book with the poem in it. It is full of other poems and rhymes and like all Richard Scarry books the illustration is fun and joyful.
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|Love this game it is so addicting. Everyone likes to play it when they come over.<br />Even the kids are hooked on it.<br />It is a game for everyone.
B00BZODDYU|4.0|I liked this movie and its plot. It reminds me of the grudge with the creepy tentacle things coming out of the darkest corner of the room and the same creepy broken bone movements. No lame killings. Lots a special effects and moments in the movie where I just had to rewind so I could get that tingling chill again. Some parts are cheesy but all around I liked this movie and recommend it. The two little girls are great actors. Also Jessica Chastain is amazing! Her acting and her black hair! Mmmm So FINE!!!!
B005LAIHYU|2.0|Worst movie I have seen. Not only does it sacrilege our famous President, pitting his legacy of moral values against unjust demons of the night, it does so in a heavy handed manner utilizing cheap colorized schemes to emphasize old school as would be done in any photography studio when you dress up as cowboy & Indian.<br />Absolute one of the worst horror movies on the market regardless if there was ever an interesting book on which it was based.<br />There is nothing more detrimental to a horror plot than unsympathetic characters fighting the bad guys. What do we care if certain people are bitten, tortured, or killed if only the main characters are focused on as people with a conscience.
B007R0WHMK|5.0|I watched it just because Ben Whishaw played the main character.<br /><br />I loved it because from the first notes the movie drags the viewer into a chilling tale and only leaves them at the end with a feeling of shock! Not a movie for kids. At all.<br /><br />And Ben Whishaw should've gotten an award for his portrayal of Grenouille.
B00006EXDM|5.0|I wanted this CD for their song, &#34;Gimme Shelter&#34;.  It is now my favorite CD because most, if not all, of my favorites are on this CD.  Rock on, Stones!!
B00992CF6W|5.0|A great game to play and a few more things needed like lava, but it is still one of my favorite games to play on my kindle fire especially when I get bird of my other apps
B000JMKTLO|5.0|I first read Gone Girl, which I really liked, and decided to try another book by Gillian Flynn.  I loved the book and couldn't put it down.
B0055PGUYU|5.0|Overall, this was a great book! I strongly believe everyone should read this book at least once in their life times. Sooner than later preferably. Helps you realize certain things that otherwise you never give a time to think about. I thought a small part of the book was very boring & dry (Rosa Parks & civil rights movement), however that was a small portion only. I would strongly recommend this book to everyone!
B00AMBLDEE|4.0|The movie is packed with action and keeps you wondering what happens next every scene. Some of the locations are amazing where this Movie is pictured.<br /><br />Don't watch it online in HD if your internet speed is &#60; 2.5 MBPS. It starts to buffer and you lose the thrilling effect. I wish Amazon was more proactive in detecting and informing the users about the speed. Got a refund anyways.
B001NLKT60|5.0|I have to say, I do not remember when the last time I have started a book and was unable to put it down. The 1st book was EXCELLENT! So I thought if the 2nd could be half as good as the first, we still have a good book. Well it was just as good if not better than the first!<br /><br />Fast paced, lots of action, turns & twists, it is everything and more I expected after loving \\"The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo\\"
B0052FG750|5.0|I just finished listening to this truly fantastic 6-cd Doors box set and it's nothing short of a 6-cd masterpiece. I also can't remember the last time I spent so little for so much. The sound quality is simply outstanding. If you are a Doors fan like myself and you don't own this magnificent box set by all means buy it immediately. This set covers the first six albums they did along with the late great Jim Morrison. I still can't believe this set was only 24.00!!--Wow what a bargain!!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Loved it! This book was hard to put down. It is very well written and flows just right. I was skeptical at first in reading it (kids killing kids...? really?) but glad I gave it a chance. Will definitely be reading the second book to this trilogy! Well done Suzanne Collins :)
B0064X7FVE|5.0|TWC has an excellent reputation for accuracy, and warnings.  The history of certain weather events is very interesting.  I would recommend this channel for people of all ages, the history events are great for children studying weather in school.
B00C32R64G|5.0|Volbeat has a one of kind sound and style, and once again they deliver a CD that I can listen to over and over.
B000FA675C|5.0|I really enjoyed this it is well written and keeps you guessing a must read for the fan of mysteries.
B004UHL9EK|4.0|I snagged this app when Amazon offered it as the FAOTD.  I'd been looking for a good, yet free, count down app for some time and this fits the bill nicely.  It's reasonably intuitive to use and I like the fact I can use my own &#34;custom&#34; icons.
B008Q08580|4.0|The performances are very good. The mystery is, as with all similar situations, why people choose to do the things they do.
B000XA5K48|5.0|Clive Owen, Monica Bellucci, Paul Giamatti. It's like Smokin' Aces (2006) but better: the mysterious Mr. Smith delivers a woman's baby amidst a shootout, and must protect the newborn from a batch of ruthless criminals after its dark secret.<br /><br />Paul Giamatti and Clive Owen and names of other actors/actresses who I don't know make up the cast of this entertaining and highly likeable movie. I would highly recommend this movie for its' entertainment value and story plot line as well.
B001UGB1X8|4.0|Other reviewers suggest that to enjoy this movie, a person would need to read the book it's based on. I disagree. I followed it just fine. Tommy Lee Jones seemed like a perfect fit for the lead role -- I found him very strong & believable. My general test for a movie is &#34;was it entertaining?&#34; The answer here is &#34;yes.&#34;
B00BR4QNJ0|5.0|Awesome game. This really passes the time.  An excellent example of casual gaming.  Everyone should download and play this game.  Is this twenty words yet?
B001FB4VZS|5.0|This season shows how the future will come if sort of thing happen or not, but some portals are better of close. Like the title saids, Doomsday come to the picture and theres a BIG fight in the street, car and buildings suffers the damages..is a total mess. The only thing I don't like is that everything is turning arround Louis Lane, a litle anoing for me personaly, other than that litle detail stills great to watch.
B00499QUK2|5.0|As a lifelong fan of Arthur Conan Doyle's original works, I approached this series quite dubiously. They have made a believer out of me. The series is smart, compelling and true to the original text.
B00177Y9ZM|5.0|Immagine you have the skill to appear where ever you have been before in just a second, or visit more than 4 places in different parts of the world in one day. This is what this movie is all about, how this guy discover his ability and the develop it with time.<br /><br />But he wasn't the only one, there are many others but death. There are a society that have been after them since the Medieval Times; they hunt them and kill them with a special technology.<br /><br />They are as fast and smart as the jumper himself...who gets rid of whom? Buy this DVD with confidence and you will know. Lots of fast action, tension, a bit of romance..over all, I believe all family can watch it.
B007BVOEPI|5.0|A truly rich series with very high production values. Well written, well cast, and very earthy. Not for the faint of heart.
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|I loved this book. So funny and witty. I'm sure people thought I was crazy when I read this book in public. Why doesn't Tina go by her real name Elizabeth?
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I really loved this book!  I finished it within days because I couldn't put it down. I also really liked Colleen Hovers slammed series.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|So interesting and so great! I was on the edge of my seat! I could not possibly put it down! I loved it!!!
B008Z9YGEE|3.0|It wasn't mind altering and fabulous.. and the premise is really disturbing.. young children out killing each other.. Really?  That's what makes good movies nowadays?  I liked the visual effects and I appreciated the work that went into the movie.  But I'm not going to be buying this one and adding it to my movie collection at home.
B0095P31L6|4.0|This was a great move.  The kids loved it and asked to watch it multiple times. I would highly recommend.
0807014273|3.0|I Thought the book would be like the one displayed but it's not. It's smaller. It also has a white and write cover. The book seemed very old as well. But it is readable. I needed it for one of my Psychology class.
B009KEN87O|5.0|such a fun game cant leave it alone need to go to sleep for work but its just so fun i gottta keep going
0670026557|5.0|One of the many challenges I struggled with was always being a helpful person, but also being someone who could ask for help. I thought that as an employee, to be successful, I had to take complete ownership of every single task and realized that asking for help as well as the need to delegate is imperative.  Through this book, I've learned that you can still be a successful giver, but the habit of not reaching out for help (to trusted people, of course) has to go if you really want to be successful in corporate America.  Also, I realized that knowing matchers is a great thing for a giver, because they are, as Adam describes them, \\"the karma police,\\" that makes sure that their giver friends are not taken advantage of.<br /><br />Great read and I appreciated a fresh look on my past working challenges and experiences!
B007N5YIUS|5.0|I love all the Angry bird games.  Once I start I can't stop!  I am always trying to beat myself.  My son downloaded on my Kindle and I told him that was a stupid game. But once I played it I couldn't stop. So then I added all the rest of the Angry Bird games.
B00475AYJQ|5.0|A terrific read.  Rothfuss takes the reader on another journey. Kvothe is a wonderful main character, and is more fallible in this book. It makes him more realistic. As a reader, you will get to know the world he lives in better, which include some wonderful characters and races.

B0010SKUYM|5.0|High quality fantasy. Not a lot of action. Instead Rothfuss takes the reader slowly by the hand on a journey to get to know the main character. A terrific read

B001ANSSDC|4.0|I was hesitant to read since there's already a movie out but glad I did. This story shows the love family and friends can have toward a person who isn't well but is trying to change.  A
B007ZQJR4M|4.0|The Book itself was very interesting, but kind of slow.  I can tell by the Trailer for Brad Pitt's movie version that there will be nothing slow about it!  Keeps your attention and something different as it is &#34;read&#34; by an ensemble cast.
B00BEZTMQ8|4.0|I really enjoyed the movie and had to have the behind the scene footage.  The quality is amazing! Looking forward to the next one in the series.
B005OT2YVA|4.0|Overall the movie is entertaining, but suffers from the same issues as the &#34;Revenge of the Fallen&#34;, namely, too long (over 2 hours) and action scenes are overdone at times. The timeline in the plot didn't mesh with the previous movies. Would have been more enjoyable if the editing was better, but that is what fast-forward on the remote is for :-)
0930289234|5.0|Ever since I read Alan Moore's sensational work on BATMAN: THE KILLING JOKE, it has been my goal to find another work of his that had the same psychologically innovating tone to it. It wasn't easy though. Alan Moore is one of the most acclaimed writers in the comic's medium, and is known for dark and grim, yet innovating works such as V FOR VENDETTA, FROM HELL, PROMETHEA, SWAMP THING, and LOST GIRLS. I have my limits when it comes to dark content in media, which made it a challenge to find another compelling work of Moore's. I first made an attempt with Swamp Thing, which seemed promise a tragic monster tale, but its occult themes pushed my limits. But I was still determined to dig up another great Alan Moore book, and I uncovered it with his most popular book of all: WATCHMEN!!!<br /><br />Watchmen was designed to break the boundaries of what a superhero comic could achieve, but it went far beyond that. It became a psychological breakthrough, and transformed the minds of comic book fans worldwide. Watchmen takes place in an alternate America during 1985, where despair and corruption has plagued society. The U.S. is now on the verge of nuclear war with the Soviet Union, and superheroes that were once a major symbol of American society have been outlawed since 77'. The members of the Watchmen (Rorschach, Nite Owl, Dr. Manhattan, Comedian, Ozymandias, & Silk Spectre) have since disbanded, but ominous events soon change everything. The story begins with the death of the Comedian, who was mysteriously murdered and thrown out his apartment window by an unknown assailant. With the rest of the world focused on the approaching apocalypse, the only one to investigate the Comedian's murder is the rogue vigilante Rorschach. Rorschach believes that someone is killing off former costumed heroes, and that the conspiracy is linked with a plot to ignite a World War III. The rest of the Watchmen ignore Rorschach's \\"mask killer\\" claims, but after Dr. Manhattan exiles himself to Mars, and Ozymandias is attacked by a hit man, one can only wonder if Rorschach's theory is true. With the doomsday clock slowly ticking towards midnight, and vigilantes suffering attacks from an unknown mastermind, one question remains: \\"Who watches the Watchmen?\\"<br /><br />Watchmen surpassed all of my expectations! The story is extremely well-written, and the plot drives on the force of the moral standards of characters in a world without hope. The characters themselves have complex psychological profiles that allow us to identify, and feel for them, despite their obvious moral flaws as people. Rorschach is the best of the batch! In him we see a man tormented by the sin and corruption in the world, that has changed him into a cold redeemer of justice, with a black and white perspective of reality (his mask reflects his personality with its ever changing inkblots)! He is one of the greatest superheroes I have seen since Spider-Man and Batman. Dr. Manhattan is the only hero with actual superpowers, separating him from the rest of society, and making him gradually less human with each passing moment. He is frequently naked throughout the book, but I don't mind this at all as he is blue-skinned, and it further symbolizes his detachment to humanity as his power is nearly equivalent to that of a god. Despite the fact that Comedian dies at the beginning, he is the force that drives the all of the characters and events in the book, as his death sets the mystery and plot into motion.  Comedian is the most flawed of all the watchmen, as he has committed unforgivable acts in his life, but the method of his portrayal allows him to be likable to readers. Ozymandais comes off as a bit of a flat character through the story until the explosive climax, which gives him depth and development that nearly rivals the previous characters, which I dare not spoil! (I think Moore did this on purpose to serve the story he tells, which is an exceptional feat to pull-off!) Nite Owl is the weakestin my opinion, as he feels too similar to Batman (even though his approach is technological, and not direct), but even he provides moments that make him more than just a character on the printed page. (Besides, his airship is just cool!)<br /><br />The book is indeed Graphic (I'd strongly advise caution towards readers under 17), but even the suggestive content has strong meaning to it, as it places superheroes in the real world, and shows how fear and corruption dominate a society swiftly approaching nuclear war. I've finally found an Alan Moore work that has not only lived up to my experience with THE KILLING JOKE, but has surpassed it completely! Alan Moore not only successfully displayed what superheroes would be like in the real world, but gave us a psychological roller coaster ride of a comic book that has been tough to surpass. It makes me want to take a look at the BEFORE WATCHMEN prequels, even though Alan Moore has no involvement in them. It is a book that is essential for all comic book fans to read! It's an experience that no other comic can offer you.<br /><br />\\"[They] will look up and shout 'save us!' And I'll look down and whisper 'no.'\\"<br />  -Rorschach's Journal.

B000R34V50|5.0|No idea why this movie bombed as it was great! Animation and voice talent was awesome! This should have been the base for the new series and movie!
B00C5W3SBE|1.0|The movie was just OK. But Disney's greed is showing by separating the 2-D & 3-D versions. This way you have to pay TWICE as much if you want the 2-D AND 3-D versions of OZ. Let's show Disney how mad we are and BOYCOTT this ridiculously greedy move on their part. DO NOT BUY this movie unless the 2-D & 3-D versions are BOTH included!
B0096DFBZQ|1.0|I REALLY disliked this game. Seems rushed and not cared for. Some more work and this could of been a great game!
0789302691|3.0|Not what I was hoping for.  Disappointing.  Non-informative.  Some nice pictures, but not worth the money.  I'd pass if I had it to do over again.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I love the setting, plot, characters, acting...what's not to like?  The only thing better would be more episodes per season.
B00BF11STU|3.0|The movie is very controversial.  There were no superstars in the movie, and the action scenes were grade C-.  I expected more.  The Academy Award reminds me of &#34;My Cousin Vinnie&#34;.  The film wasn't mediocre, but close.
B007SZ0E1K|5.0|Some of my software and even task manager showed 2 cores in use. With some research I found that EASY BCD allowed you to force Windows 7 to change from 2 to 4 cores. The difference was night and day. Like others this was added after I installed Windows 7 Home Premium, and a Z77 Motherboard. I went from a 3D Mark 11 Benchmark of about 7,000+ to 9,700+. and boosted games FRAPS 30 to 40%.<br />  Can you overclock this thing? Hell ya! 4.5 or higher is very possible
B00BLGZN1S|5.0|The plot actually was good and had some historical fact.  I didn't recognize any of the actors aside from Tom Sizemore, but the parts were played well.  Sizemore is the ultimate fool.  He had so much potential, but the impact of drugs & alcohol made it impossible for him to sustain the &#34;big&#34; name he might have had.  There were scenes where the actors are standing outside an opera house dressed in German uniforms carrying on conversations in English that would certainly not transpire in reality.  But with all its shortcomings, it is definitely worth the price.
0679805273|5.0|I will be giving this to my daughter's teachers each year (secretely) and present to her at her highschool graduation.  I received this book for college graduation myself.  Always a great gift and good read.
B005KJJ4F8|5.0|This book was breath taking! I was on the edge of my seat the whole time. Everybody has to read this book!
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I'm so glad that Amazon is carrying this since Netflix didn't have season 2.  I'm loving it and can't wait to watch season 3.
B00A1EOBJQ|4.0|I'm really enjoying this and am grateful for the Amazon music cloud service that is included. Enjoy the television series and it's nice to really listen to the lyrics without the video cuts overwhelming the words.
B000ECXV2I|2.0|the dvd that was sent did not work in my player an error code was displayed, i was told by a block buster employee that the disc may not have been manufactured for US use, why would they send that out?, i had to contact the  seller  to get a return label, because i do not have a printer. I cynically think that these types of things sometimes happen because the seller may think the buyer  will not bother to go through the trouble to return it and they're just unloading troublesome inventory. that's just me
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I don't usually faithfully watch an entire TV series; I guess I'm afraid of that kind of commitment. But Downton Abbey is a show I am willing to make an exception for. If you're into juicy drama with a historical twist, or even if your not, watch on episode and you won't be able to stop.
B00BD2DRHW|4.0|I think this is a good game for young people. I played the game some and will play it more
030758836X|3.0|Like several other readers, I would have given a 4-5 star review through most of the book, but the ending disappointed me and left me with a \\"meh\\" feeling....  None of the main characters have any redeeming qualities (nobody to \\"root for\\"), which I could live with if the plot and ending made up for it.  In the end I kept expecting SOMEBODY to get what was coming to them, but they don't - they just continue  to play out their majorly dysfunctional life, essentially in the same place they were when the book started. Which may be what the author intended, I don't know.  I may try another of her novels, but only from the library.
B00BHHIWQO|4.0|This game is fun. I enjoy the speed factor to find the sets of three or more matching icons. The only problem I have is having to wait to earn more free lives.
B00B19DMUE|5.0|On the edge of your seat, chill tingling movie.  Made my wife and I nervous just watching it. Great movie to watch on a stormy Sunday night like we<br />Did.
0439023521|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this trilogy I could not put them down.  Shame the movie didn't do them justice.  I loved the characters, the plot, the suspense, the underlying message I found very moving.

B00992CF6W|5.0|You guys need to get this app it is not like the computer but you can play two players and do survival or creative
B0068FZ0GK|5.0|I wish I had seen this movie when it first came out. I just loved it.....Kevin was terrific. It was just pure entertainment which in this day and age is sometimes hard to find. I would recommend to anyone who just wants to chill out for a while
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|I loved it. One of the most entertaining and engaging movies I've seen in a long time. Bonus: streaming was free through prime! Can't wait for the next one. Thanks Amazon Prime. Very happy customer so far.

B009H5IS1W|4.0|Great action and storyline. Thie characters are great and the way they work together as a team adds an added dimension to the show
B0059R5Q08|5.0|My husband and I just watched &#34;Jane Eyre,&#34; with Mia Wasikowska in the title role. I thought it was almost perfect. It was well-written, had excellent acting, beautiful cinematography, great music and maintained the spirit of the novel. It has been a while since I read the book, but the hardest part of the book to incorporate into a movie I think - the end with the Rivers family - was handled well through flashbacks. That gave the film an exciting edge from the very beginning. The one thing I don't think was included in this version was Jane's familial relationship with this family, but that was minor and didn't affect the rest of the film. The only other movie version I've seen is the one with William Hurt as Rochester, and I thought it was boring. I was hesitant to view another one because I love and respect the book so much, but based on the high reviews of the script by Moira Buffini, I decided to try; and I was not disappointed. I cannot recommend it more highly.
B001MSMULG|4.0|I couldn't put this book down! That was the easy part; what to say about it's presumed protagonist, the Israeli spy Gabriel Allon, was more problematic. Compared to Daniel Craig's Bond iterations, Allon was disturbingly effete. Sure he shot people through the eye, but I could never sense his menacing physicality. His puppetmaster and superior, Ari Shamron, seemed more real: gruff, wizened, hardened, morally unconcerned, and at his older age, maybe the greater threat in a fistfight. Allon, trying to retire to Zen-like art restoration, sometimes seemed as delicate as his avocation. The plot at least saves our hero...it gave him something to do, and the plot was mesmerizing to the very end.<br />The real chameleonic character is the pseudonymous Jacqueline Delacroix, model and Israeli secret agent. She is at once visually stunning, viscerally sexual, clever enough to stay alive chained to all four corners of a bed, then demure enough to make this reviewer want to marry her! She, by sheer guile, cements the faults her masters manage to fall into. Shamron needs her urban sexual cool; Allon needs whatever Shamron tells him he needs out of her. We are to buy into their once torrid love affair after an earlier mission together, yet I don't see Allon as enough challenge for her. Jacqueline was the real hero of this novel; she propelled us through the bedrooms of Arab terrorists, stunning art galleries, the streets of Montreal, modeling jobs in Paris, and ultimately the killing fields of Manhattan.<br />What kept me glued was the interplay of the clever spy work of the Israeli and Palestinian enemies, followed by the gaffes of each side at just the wrong moment! It wasn't comedic, and in fact, probably mimicked the vagaries of real life espionage. And that was my hook: the triumphs and failures of real assassins, possibly sitting next to us on the subway anticipating their day and its demons, as we do ours. I will read much more of Daniel Silva!
B0013TTLDE|5.0|A fabulous novel with a storyline along the lines of Downton Abbey. Grace Bradley, the housemaid, later to become a ladies maid tells the story of the lives of the family of Lord and Lady Ashbury, their sons, and their grandchildren, David, Emmeline, and Hannah. The story begins with Grace first applying for the position of housemaid at Riverton Manor in the early 1920s. This novel encompasses both great wars and is filled with wonderful descriptions of life pre World War I , and the changed, desperate, colorful life afterwards. The House at Riverton is filled with secrets, intrigue, mystery, love, and passion and is extremely well written. I was unable to put it down
B00062PN6I|5.0|this order was shipped and sent out immediately. was just looking for some cheap headphones for home recording but actually got a good set for a cheap price. thanks

B006HL9G10|5.0|Easy to use, and very handy. I would recommend this product for everyone.  Great app to use for meditation or other timing needs.
B003TOMAPC|5.0|Kick-Ass is the name adopted by a teen-ager who wants to be a superhero.  He learns quickly that it's more difficult than he had imagined.  Nicolas Cage is an adult who is preparing his daughter to join him as a &#34;dynamic duo&#34; to get vengeance on the mobster who framed Cage for a crime.  What is interesting is that in a live-action movie about comic-book characters, the real-life story of the tragedy that befalls Cage's character is told in comic-book form.  This is simply an ingenious way to contrast the difference between what these superheros are trying to do and the real life that now eludes them.  Very symbolic, very imaginative way to get the point of the movie across.<br /><br />I can't wait for the sequel (coming out Summer, 2013)
B004EPYZT4|5.0|This movie is better than I expected.  Great story and lots of blood and guts. Warning: People that do not like blood and guts movies probably should not watch this.  But if your a fan of Conan like I am this movie is amazing. I look forward to seeing Arnold Shwartsineger(sorry...I don't know how to spell his long last name) in the new Conan movie he will be in.  I give this movie an A+. Great Sword and Sorcery movie.

B005LAIHQS|5.0|It's not very often that sequels meet up to the expectation of the first movie.  The actors have a huge part to play in this movie's success.  I'm already a Will Smith fan, but Josh Brolin made this movie the success it is.  I'd recommend this to my friends and family.

B000E5N62U|4.0|Postcard from the War on Terror Morph the Cat Review (Donald Fagen) by John T. Kuehn (This might be lengthy, but as a long time &#34;doctor of Dan&#34; I think I may have some insight. See Bio at the end for my CV.  You can also google me for pix etc in my current job.)  First, Don Fagen's offering here...right on schedule three years after &#34;Everything Must Go,&#34; (EMG) is clearly up to the high standards of the Steely Dan musical legacy. Danophiles will note that EMG came out three years after &#34;Two Against Nature&#34;[TAN] .  This solo effort is simply Steely Dan without Walter Becker, just as was &#34;The Nightfly.&#34;  This is not meant as a slur in any way against either of the dynamic duo, in fact it is rather a large tribute to the creativity, writing ability, and excellent musicianship of Fagen.  Next, one must address the Dan method, which is here intact.  One must realize, as the bass player on the &#34;Two Against Nature Steely Dan House Party&#34; video chronicles, that these boys know exactly what they want. To paraphrase the bassist, &#34;these guys have no doubts about what they want and how they want to sound, which is great since most musicians I have worked with don't have a clue.&#34;  So what the Dan/Fagen do is use what I like to call a &#34;cultural pop-music postcard&#34; approach to creating their albums. They drop in on the mass culture and take snapshots, work them into relatively complex melodic songs, and then arrange them in an album. Sometimes the effort is very focused and thematic--this is Fagen's influence since the most thematic of the Dan/Fagen albums have been the solo efforts--especially this latest, even more so than the superficially more unified &#34;Kamakiriad.&#34; For example, &#34;Countdown to ecstasy&#34; is at look LA in the 70's, Royal Scam a visit to NEW YORK for the same time period and AJA and Gaucho drop in on the late 70's and early 80's.  Kamakiriad is a sunny reflection (maybe partly cloudy) on the 90's, and of course TAN and EMG capture both sides of 911, pre and post.  &#34;Morph&#34; continues this method and includes all the recent trends:  psycho moms, Ray Charles, documentaries of rock bands, latte, terrorists, and airport security check-in. Okay, so that is the meta-method.  At the operational level they apply their universal themes. By this I mean they have several tried and true themes they visit on every album:  -Male Losers-their glory, their tragedy, our empathy for them, their stupidity-- losers are a big component of the Dan's snapshot method--e.g. &#34;Charlie Freak,&#34; &#34;Here at the Western World&#34; &#34;Deacon Blues&#34; &#34;Dirty Work&#34; &#34;Fire in the Hole&#34; &#34;My Rival&#34; &#34;Negative Girl&#34;(a combination with another category below) and, most brilliantly &#34;Cousin Dupree&#34; and &#34;Shame About me,&#34; from TAN. Of course &#34;Everything Must Go&#34; -similar to Deacon Blues--is a tribute to failure on a grand scale. -Neurotic/Psychotic Women- These gals intersect with the losers in many cases, mutually supporting pathologies if you will.  e.g. &#34;Fire in the Hole,&#34; &#34;Gold Teeth&#34;(your mouth your legs your gift for the runaround), &#34;Monkey in Your Soul&#34; &#34;Rikki don't lose that Number&#34;&#34;Black Cow&#34;(which might also be about a neurotic gay person), &#34;Negative Girl/Almost Gothic,&#34; and most recently and brilliantly, &#34;Lunch with Gina.&#34;  Variations on a theme. As you can see we have covered a lot of ground--Dan/Fagen spend most of their time on people and their &#34;little&#34; quirks.  So you see how the postcard method is well suited to this operational focus on interesting topics for musical discussion.  More. -Apocalypse/Armageddon.  The Dan, Fagen, have always been eschatological. e.g. &#34;King of the World,&#34; &#34;Black Friday,&#34; &#34;Tomorrow's Girls,&#34; (another intersection, but with scifi for good measure), &#34;Godwacker&#34; (GW for those of you who haven't figured it out yet) and &#34;the Last Mall&#34;.  -Prejudice- This is a theme they weave into many songs but it has been central to several-&#34;Barrytown,&#34; &#34;any World,&#34; &#34;The Royal Scam,&#34; &#34;Greenflower Street&#34; (From Nightfly).  -The Dangers of Drug use. No need to list songs since this theme is in just about every song--although Dr. Wu and Charlie Freak are the best.  -Nostalgia--a difficult topic that the Dan reserves only for its most impressive efforts-&#34;Pretzel Logic,&#34; &#34;Midnight Cruiser,&#34; &#34;Home at Last,&#34; &#34;Parker's Band&#34; and Dan/Fagen's straight up delivery of Ellington's classics &#34;East St. Louis Toodle-oo&#34; and &#34;Ruby&#34;(from Nightfly),  &#34;Right into Springtime&#34; (from Kamakiriad), and &#34;Blues Beach.&#34;  -Terrorism - The Dan have been ahead of the curve on this one. e.g. &#34;Don't take me Alive,&#34; &#34;Third World Man,&#34;  &#34;Godwacker&#34; (again) and several songs on the new album.  -And last but not least--INSANITY(and its cousin paranoia), which is the only way one can explain &#34;The Boston Rag&#34;  and other songs such as &#34;Turn that Heartbeat Over Again,&#34; &#34;Bad Sneakers,&#34; &#34;The Fez&#34;...and Dr. Wu (as a result of drugs). The new Fagen CD includes comments for each song that confirms these theories, and yes there are other topics I didn't cover...social issues, naiveté, etc.   The final component of the Dan method is of course the music. They have particular styles that the employ consistently, Thelonius Monk/Charles Mingus inspired jazz (the only way to account for the strange chords in something like &#34;Through with Buzz&#34;), Big Band jazz (&#34;Parker's Band,&#34;  &#34;Ruby&#34;), pop (Hey Nineteen/Dirty Work and most of Nightfly), blues rock (Bodisattva), multi guitar fantasies (Reelin in the Years, Aja), jazz rock (Gold Teeth, Chain Lightening, Home Again), ballads (Brooklyn, Here at the Western World, Book of Liars), and on...and they keep adding to their list of musical styles that they fuse into their work. For example:  the Dan drop in on, say, 2000 for a look around. They go back to the studio and apply musical styles to their topic list.  So, you take insanity meets voodoo, use a layered rock rhythm meets some cool jazz, and presto-chango you have &#34;Two Against Nature&#34;.  Or you take techno-pop, comic books, secret agents, and video games--give it the steely dan minor-seventh chord treatment--da-daaa-- and come up with &#34;Pixelene&#34;.  With all this in mind-- and it's a lot--here are my comments for Morph the Cat: First, those of you who long for the guitar lines of Walter Becker need not worry. Among Fagen's stable of guitar pros are Steely Dan veterans John Herrington and Hugh McCracken (who does stellar work with a Leslie pre-amp).  Herrington can imitate just about any of the great Dan guitarists, including Becker, although his impressions of Rick Derringer, first heard and seen by this writer on the Two Against Nature House party video CD version of &#34;Black Friday,&#34; are a real retro treat for diehards like me who subscribe to the &#34;Pretzel Logic/Katy Lied- were-the-Dan's-best-work&#34; school. The Presence of McCracken, too, gives this album a bit of the sound of the Royal Scam era.   Fagen continues to employ his trademark approach to electric pianos, using the Fender sound when going for the Jazz rock feel and the Wurlitzer for his send up on Ray Charles. Too, Fagen is one of the best in the biz at using the cheesy organ riff to slide into a catchy, rhythmic pop daydream.  As usual new musicians of incredible talent that no one has heard of appear and reap havoc (principally new guitarists Vignola and Krantz, but some new horn guys as well). Also, Fagen has decided to employ at length something he only synthesized in the past, a harmonica, including numerous solos--new ground for the Dan (except of course the schizoid harmonica on &#34;Show Biz Kids,&#34; which doesn't count).  Finally, under these general comments, is the structural flow of the album.  Fagen uses a reprise of the &#34;Morph the cat&#34; theme which is also the first cut. In doing this Fagen has essentially created an endless circle of music since as the reprise fades away with its great bass line it then jumps back in just as you begin to miss it as cut 1 of the album.  This causes the line to subliminally insert itself into your brain--bump budda-dump dump.  You are ready to go again, and again,.....reminds me of Jethro Tull's bizarre echo line in the middle of &#34;Thick as a Brick&#34;(which only worked on the old 8-track, the album had to be turned over at its most climatic moment, the problem was resolved by the CD).  songs- &#34;Morph the Cat&#34;--heavy density pop meets layered jazz sound. Topic is different...is this like a benign version of M. Night Shyamalan's &#34;Signs&#34;?  Fagen's intro lyrics comments are some help, but a bit of a throw back to &#34;Kamakiriad&#34; with a nod to Fagen's spiritual home of Manhattan. Herrington's guitar solo resurrects the blistering sort of work that Skunk Baxter, Larry Carlton and Rick Derringer used to deliver--a very welcome development...more later.  The vocal harmonies are so rich and dense one is very much reminded of Nightfly's &#34;(Try to Hang on) Maxine.&#34;  &#34;H-Gang,&#34; - another song that once you hear it you program it into your brain's muzak function--a bit like the  &#34;Heard it on the Grapevine&#34; riff but with a sound that reminded me vaguely of a &#34;Royal Scan&#34; track with Herrington doing a &#34;Haitian Divorce&#34;/Larry Carlton guitar number. The subject of the song itself is completely explained by Fagen in his comments and addresses the recent dearth of documentary films on late period rockers and derelict musicians (except this one retires to the middle class, a typical Fagen ploy).  &#34;What I do&#34;-starts out as a straight ahead tribute to Ray Charles' influence on Donald F. with some real rock and roll Wurlitzer work.  Harmonica is a very nice touch--Stevie Wonder meets &#34;What I say&#34;.  In the end the song turns into Fagen musing on his own efforts to find himself as &#34;its what I do&#34;.  A very catchy melody in every respect.  &#34;Brite Nitegown.&#34;  Thank the Lord for Fagen's notes...that way those of us less inclined &#34;to figure it out&#34; will realize this is a song about death.  The music is light and upbeat as always...Fagen is mocking the Reaper.  Could be Fagen personalizing his ongoing fascination with apocalypse, this time at the personal level.  Not sure he has resolved his issues with the topic, though.  Drug reference near the end--the old OD theme.  &#34;Pagoda of Funn.&#34;  Lovers retreat from reality, a ballad about denial.  But Fagen keeps it real with references to Al Jazeera and the looming apocalypse just around the corner.  Too, Fagen's proposal that the institution of marriage is an unlikely (and unrealistic) hiding place from the troubles of the world is on target.  Marriage may just be a bigger challenge than dying stars and severed heads.  &#34;Security Joan.&#34;  Fagen takes the post-911 ordinary and turns it into a romantic song, very upbeat rhythm work by the guitars is reminiscent of &#34;Lunch with Gina.&#34;  Search me now.  &#34;The Night belongs to Mona&#34; - okay, here she is, the seminal Dan-neurotic female.  Again the comments say it all. Too, instead of any outright male losers on this album we have instead this song --the only clear allusion to that theme, with Mona in the title role holding down two themes and &#34;trying to keep it together.&#34; The musical dénouement is on a classic Dan note, the suspended minor ninth chord that trails into the ionosphere (see end of &#34;Gaucho&#34;).  &#34;Mary close the Garden Door&#34;- this song has received a great deal of attention in the blog-o-sphere for its political tone, the worries over the capture of the governmentby, in Fagen's words, &#34;a thuggish cult.&#34;  Stick it to the Bushies, Don! That may be, although the song can apply to any level of the government one may wish to visit: state, local and national...to say nothing of the UN (what about those Lincoln town cars?).  That said, this song is among darkest in terms of tone on the album, its clear that Fagen is fascinated not only with the &#34;cult's&#34; rise to power but also the &#34;denial&#34; of Mary and the singer about its implications. If they ignore it maybe it will go away.  There is more going on here than a liberal lament.  &#34;Morph the Cat Reprise&#34; a quick chorus and then into an instrumental riff session, with Herrington trading Becker-like guitar licks with a newcomer, Vignola, who plays guitar like Buck Dharma (of Blue Oyster Cult) without the decibels. Excellent, its always a treat when Fagen let's the boys &#34;stretch out&#34;.  I only have one quibble, could the Dan at least bring back the Mu Major chord (the suspended major chord ninth) for some retro-treatment? A measure of the Dan's influence and intersection with blog-world is that, barely a month after its release, there are already 82,  82!, customer reviews on the amazon.com site.

B008602KQI|3.0|This has to be one of the most over rated books I've read in a long time. The movie does a very good job given the implausible and one-dimensional storyline.

B0067R0APK|2.0|I agree with everyone, i pay for the app and it's a lower version release than free? Plus this newer version is constantly freezing up and slow to respond - not unlike the developers who are apparently apathetic to paying customers concerns and complaints....advice to new users, keep your money.
B00005V9IL|2.0|Couldn't believe it just VHS copied to DVD Save you money until it's remastered DVD or Blu-Ray.  At least didn't spend much
B009NG1Q96|5.0|I have been waiting for this book for months having purchased the novella in March and then anxiously counting down the days until I could see what happened with America and Maxin. Now I'll have to wait even longer for the next book. Great continuation of the narrative and I thoroughly enjoyed the development of feelings between the two main characters.  A great read!!!
B009HUB40Y|4.0|when I downloaded this I was hoping it was similar to candy saga....but not. that said I don't hats it nor love it.
B005H9B44A|4.0|I enjoyed this Thor.  I didn't think it was a knock my sox off movie, but they got a lot of the story out in the time they had to get it done.  I think it could have been like a 3 hour movie.  So sad that we try to limit all movies to the two hour time frame and don't just take the time to make it the best movie.
B00AMBK6J2|3.0|Tis movie is funny if you like family guy style humor. It is more or less a live action version of this show.
B004WGIXX4|5.0|I liked this movie mostly because I have recently been in a relationship similar to this.  It wasn't an NSA relationship but more of a Friends only with not as much sex.  More hanging out and doing things together.  Woman had similar rules and behavior to Female character, and I couldn't understand and still don't really her hang ups.  This movie is well done, and shows how some people fear committed relationships.
B00APJLX8E|4.0|Although there is not much here for adults and its very silly I think its perfect for your little children.
B005WYFLNU|5.0|My 2 yr old granddaughter really likes these.  They offer many hours of play, and the stickers are easily repositioned.
B005SEYOXW|5.0|I must say after the first episode I was hooked.  Only watching it for the first time this month. I really wish it would have gotten another season.
1451627297|5.0|I liked the condition of the book when I recieved it. I am a Stephen King fan. I have a large collection of his books. But there are a few I still don't have.
B0095P31L6|3.0|Classic story line of an old-style &#34;Western&#34; with an animated twist.  The film is funny enough, but the ultimately predictable story line makes this good only for a one-time rental.  The kids did love the animation and some of the sillier sight gags.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|I have loved this app since I got it on my iPod years ago. When I purchased my kindle, I got the Sleepy Time app for variety, which was great until it started skipping at the loops. I have NEVER had a problem with this app, I only wish it had a shower noise.
B008Y73940|5.0|This was a great movie!  I would highly recommend watching this movie, it was well worth it.  Also love MM
B006GLLREU|1.0|Very depressing and boring.  Not at all as good as Season 1. Wish we had not purchased the whole season.
B004X75RK4|5.0|Bullock and Reynolds are priceless together!!! We laughed uncontrollably and would highly recommend this movie to any couple!!  A+++ for The Proposal
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|graphics are great. love g5 games. I could play it again. can not wait for another game. I loved it.
B00139XTG4|1.0|The book was defective on my I pad and I was unable to get a credit for it. I ordered it twice
B007BVOEPI|4.0|...and doggy style sex. A bit superfluous for my taste as well as deviating from the book a bit (there is a recurring role of a prostitute who I've seen naked and doing the dirty at least once every other episode, it feels like), but I don't watch anything on HBO or even a lot of cable TV to begin with, so perhaps I'm just not accustomed to it (btw, I'm 30, not 80). But... if you're into that sort of thing, then for you it wont detract from what is otherwise a good show with a solid cast.
B000GFLE86|4.0|I like her choice of songs.  This is more of what I had expected and her sounding like Billie Holiday is a plus.
B00BHMETKC|5.0|This movie was full of adventure. Kept me at the edge of my seat the entire time i was watching. Go america!!
B000SO7OL6|4.0|After listening to this I realized I would like to hear her on more current songs.  These are of course covers of oldies, but goodies, but it is a good CD.
B00BHU9BV6|5.0|I loved this movie... Full of drama, a great love story will definitely recommend to watch. Keira knightley was inspiring
1449417051|5.0|Very cute calendar with descriptions and drawings.  This was purchased as a gift and was very well received.  A few of the pictures are going to be framed.
B00CDT41RY|5.0|This movie was awesome! I love jamie foxx funny, sad and exciting. Watched it twice in one day definitely recommend
B000002JAX|3.0|Not quite what I expected.  I was expecting more jazzy/bluesy.  But a very good voice.  Very atmospheric, mood music for background.
B000SEFNMS|4.0|I am a math teacher and was assigned to monitor an English class.  The students in the English class had an assignment to read the first 3 chapters of &#34;Into the Wild&#34; so I decided to read it myself since I had already read another of Krakauer's books, &#34;Into Thin Air&#34;.  Although the students did not seem too interested (10th grade), I thought it was a good read and it made me think about my own &#34;journey&#34;, so to speak, when I was a teenager.  If you like other &#34;outdoor adventure&#34; books written by Krakauer, you will like this book, I think because in typical Krakauer style, the author mixes in stories of his own as well as his thoughts and perspectives on life.
B0061JPYX2|3.0|This is a compliation at the beginning or her career and the end.  However, the duet with Tony Bennett is excellent and shows what a talent she was and how much further she could have gone.
B00BZODDYU|3.0|Here is another scary movie presented by Del Toro, NOT directed by him. It's an average movie, not the type of movie he makes, which are horrible and beautiful masterpieces. I wish he would direct a few more. These \\"presented\\" by him are advertised very cleverly, almost like they are trying to trick you into thinking its a movie he directed. It even mentions Pan's Labyrinth on the box cover.<br /><br />The scares are mostly jump scares with loud screeching by the orchestra. The characters are very unlikeable, esp. the girlfriend who is in a band. The music is awful. Mama has a few decent moments but it lacks too much to be a great film.
B004ADF7RO|4.0|I saw this movie with my 6 year old granddaughter when she was sick. I forgot about a few crude times where crude language was used. She absolutely loved the movie and it kept her entertained. I was afraid that she wouldn't sit still for it, but she wanted to watch it again when it was over.<br /><br />I watched the movie when my daughter was young and I knew it would be a hit with her daughter. Loved it!
B007URVZJ6|5.0|Excellent guide for formating your book to self-publish on Amazon. The instructions are very easy to follow and result in a professional looking product.
B001FVV2X2|4.0|Every time they inject someone with anything they use a gigantic 4&#34; needle inserted so deep it looks like it must be going all the way down to the bone marrow.  Seriously?  Have NONE of these people ever gotten a real injection before? LOL<br /><br />Other than that, I love the show, love Peter and Olivia, Walter is a HOOT, and I lust after Broyles.  He's luscious. ;-)
B0064MPXFA|5.0|I like both the leads in this story and find it quite addicting.  I have just finished the 2nd season and can't wait to start the third!
B00881PTRC|5.0|Aside from the drawings and animations being adorable, this is one of the better hangman games I have played. It made me laugh several times on the default setting. I guess my only complaint is that you are tempted to let the little guy hang just so you can see the animation!
B00BLGXL3U|2.0|Good acting that cannot overcome a fair script.  This is one of those films that make me grateful for Amazon's instant streaming.  The price was right!
0307895475|5.0|This book covers more then all. Just wished it had dragon born coverage. I'm a skyrim fan so I love the book. It's helped me a lot so far. Great stuff
B00881PTRC|5.0|I really enjoy it and recommend it for old and new players alike. It's extremely simple to get s started playing.
1452115567|5.0|Maddie on Things is a wonderful story of a man and man's best friend.  Theron Humphrey is creative in showing how pet adoption can be just as rewarding, while taking such a \\"simple\\" idea and creating a great story of travels around the U.S. The book is funny, inspiring and just all around enjoyable to look at.  Every time I flip through the pages, I find another \\"favorite\\" image. Like I said, wonderful for all ages, but definitely a great one for children and the other pet lovers out there.
B009AMANBA|5.0|I chose this movie because it was a very good movie to see a little history played out with some good actors.

B000IFQLBE|5.0|I wore my first one out.  Just had to have another one.  I own 8 of his cd's.  Seen him in concert 3 times.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Such a great story! I loved getting inside the psychotic mind of the abusive husband. I know people who see nothing wrong with their horrible actions and wrongly judge everyone around them. So strange that he knew all the worst sins in the Bible, but couldn't see that beating the crap out of your wife  is wrong. I got some insight there! True, unselfish wife! Don't think many of us would have it in US to do what she did! Loved the whole thing!
B00BGIC2J2|1.0|Trashy without any redeeming value. Five of us watched it and decided to abandon it after about 30 minutes. We felt our time was worth more than the money we spent to rent it.
B005DJREGQ|4.0|I've been meaning to watch this for awhile, and finally got around to it.  Not another stupid high school sitcom.  Likeable characters, fun mean girls, dorkiness galore!  Hilariously awkward!!!!
B007BVMVDU|5.0|This show is so well done! Amazing actors, plots, cinematography and so much more. You won't be able to stop watching.
B0076DELIG|4.0|Plenty of action to make me think about the book even when I wasn't reading. Will look for more Harry Bosch novels.
B000SEIDR0|5.0|It's one of those books that makes you look back on how you're doing things and decide if you need to change. Visits both extremes of the world and provides a happy medium if you're willing to make a few changes.
0425252868|5.0|Very nice. A great gift for my grandson. Not much more to say. I'm saving it for Christmas. Happy Spring
B000FBFN1U|5.0|This book is amazing. While the first two books were so good and easily kept my attention, this one had more happen in the last few hundred pages than the first two books combined. Quite a few mouth dropped open moments.
B00C7TAF3Y|4.0|Thoroughly enjoyed this game!  Puzzles were the right amount of difficulty.  A welcome change to escape games.  The only problem I found was the screen was hard to see if exterior lights were to bright.  Otherwise excellent game!  Can't wait for the next game
1449410243|5.0|I loved this book.  I passed it around the office and everyone enjoyed the material that wasn't on the oatmeal's website.

B000N2HCM4|3.0|I think Barack Obama is a fascinating man.  Determined, successful, he overcame prejudice and an unstable home life to become the President of the United States.  When one reads this book, one has to realize it was written just after he left Chicago and arrived in Washington as a young senator, so this book reflects his viewpoints as of that time.  To use a childish term, I would describe him as &#34;whiny,&#34;  He whines about everything, especially involving the Caucasians.  His familly suffered because of the white man; Africa suffers because of the white man; Chicago suffers because of the white man; the world is unfairly dominated by the white man.<br />  But I also believe that Obama has grown on the world stage and has somewhat moderated his narrow outlook.  What the book does offer is a very insightful look into the early Obama years and his relationship with his family.  His personal growth is most evident by reading this book, and then reading his later book, &#34;The Audacity of Hope.&#34;
B0083ZRAJS|5.0|I loved this book! It was amazing I read it to my family and they loved it too. That's it bye bye
B000FA675C|5.0|I read this in paperback and watched the movie.  This was deservedly a big hit. Of course,m the history behind it is speculative and controversial.

B002MQYOFW|5.0|I chose this rating because I think that this movie was a 5 star thriller. I thought that this book showed lots of action and enthusiasm .

B00BEPVAV8|5.0|Very fun I play it all the time nothing's not fun about it it's all very very fun I give it  five stars

B002QXI2M2|5.0|Orpheus und Eurydike is a dance-opera.  Pina Bausch took Gluck's ancient Orpheus and Eurydike opera and tells the story very strongly.  I knew the story, having seen the entire opera with a contra-tenor playing Orpheus. Once I figured out the sub titles, allowing me to follow the story line better, I was able to understand better the action.  Many of the words of the libretto are stripped away leaving the stark tale of twice lost love.  The interplay of the dancer and singer pairs in the last scene is remarkably outstanding.<br /><br />The voices are excellent, sung on stage by two outstanding sopranos. The singers are in beautiful, long, black, floor length gowns, and mostly allow the dancers to be the visual center of attention.<br /><br />The dancers are all superb bringing out the anguish, the grief, the sadness, the loss of the tale. The dancing is strong and graceful and well demonstrates the emotions of the characters.  The costumes are very effective.  The ladies all wear over the shoulder, floor length white gowns, except Eurydike who wears a similar, very red gown.  The men are very effective mostly in dance shorts, occasional jackets or aprons.  Orpheus is very effective in his dance shorts, his exposed postures, body language and facial expressions portraying the emotional part very well.<br /><br />The settings are simple, but support the action.<br /><br />The overall passion of the love of Orpheus for his Eurydike is obvious from the start, soon after her death. The underworld is portrayed as Gluck and the ancient Greek tradition saw it, not the modern Christian, Dante, version.  The long, emotional walk up from Hades is well set with the singer and dancer pairs interacting very well.<br /><br />The dance - opera combination is very effective in this case, making a strong production.  I have seen one other combination of dance and opera (beyond the French tradition of throwing in a ballet scene) and that was the Denver Opera production where a set of 2 - 12 dancers danced the moods and emotions of the characters around the characters.  My memory fails me.  That was either Hansel und Gretel or Orpheus und Euryudike.  It was also very effective.  So, in good hands, and the right story, the combination of dance and opera can blend to make a more effective production than either alone.2 - 12 dancers danced the moods and emotions of the characters around the characters.

B00CDT41RY|2.0|That Tarantino won this year's Oscar for this screenplay is inexplicable. True - why it merits two, not one, star - Waltz's dentist is a clever idea, cleverly played, but the inanities abound. It's amazing, the scores of armed men that can be lurking just outside the door without our ever having heard of them before, and enough endings to make you think you've gone back in time to a Saturday morning serial. All an excuse, of course, for Tarantino's borish brand of violence, which is to say, quantities of gore. If it were to serve the story..... But I grew up on Peckinpah and am asking too much. Overkill, indeed.
B000FCKGPC|2.0|So boring, so much so that Irefuse to complete the series - can't believe it's a TV show on HBO.
B00APJLFEG|4.0|This was a good film to share with my six year old grandaughter.  Some subtle humor for the grownups and lots of action for the kiddo!
B009SJ3GUK|3.0|Overall, it was worth watching. My biggest issue is that the storyline appears to be all over the place and lacking cohesiveness. Is it about aliens, the devil, the mistaken identity of a serial killer, a demented Santa, a conflicted nun? Can we tie these all together please. Jessica Lange does an awesome job with her acting. She brings depth to her character. Looking forward to next season.
B0029LCJJS|4.0|Although I am sure this may not be 100% accurate and that there is some dramatization involved to make it such an interesting show I thoroughly enjoyed watching this.  The details in the costumes and set designs is fabulous and the story is riveting.  I watched this On Demand and went through the first season in a weekend.  I am about to start season four and this has also prompted me to want to read the actual history of this era!
B0014XCMVM|5.0|I found it incredible that she could realeas this disc and have it be ignored by radio and most airplay. this is a stunning album that any artist would be proud to release, let alone an artist 20 years along in a career with such glorious highs and the lows to go along with them.<br /><br />This album shows her at a more mature level with great songwriting skills on display. excellent backing musicians. With songs that search the depths and some songs that just kick back and party.<br /><br />Its a pity that the state of music allows such a great record to go unnoticed.
B0095P31L6|3.0|The movie doesn't have the great story behind it; but the animation was good.  Give it a try you'll probably enjoy it.
B0016NF06O|4.0|An unusual mix, but entertaining nonetheless.  Nelson has his own take on tunes, but we know what he's singing and Marsalis just adds that little bit of class.
B00BD2DRHW|3.0|Fun, but the guidelines for playing were haphazard.  Also, no hints on how to do it better.  But other wise fun.
B004UHL9EK|4.0|Great timer app that is very flexible.  I like that you can add your own pic for each alarm.  It has everything you need, except for a Tabata timer.  Add a fully customizable Tabata timer and it will be everything anyone could ever ask for.
B00B22IJXK|4.0|this is a very simple application and i can use to made special efect to my pictures, or i can use to see the photos
B0064T6LV8|5.0|Downloaded in seconds and he uses it every time he can get his hands on my Kindle Fire HD. Very intuitive.

B004LOMB2Q|5.0|This app saved my life. I have it on my laptop, kindle and iphone. when my laptop messed up I didn't have to worry about my class notes being lost, I still had them on my kindle and phone.
B009NG1Q96|5.0|It was so good! Loved it so much!!!  No matter what anyone says about this series, just know its awesome!  Get it, no hesitating! I was debating wether or not to buy this for 11$. I bought it after a couple hours and i would spend so much more for it! Just AMAZING!!!!!!
B004RKXHZY|4.0|Lola and the Boy Next Door is not groundbreaking or surprising in any way, but I think that's what makes it special. Stephanie Perkins has woven a very real story with imperfect people and complications and loose ends. The characters all have their own quirks and eccentricities that imbue the story with a delightful humor. And as the characters stumble their way towards the ending that you know is coming, it leaves you no less satisfied in the end.
0307730697|5.0|every high school and college student should be required to read  this book.There is not such of a thing to be a failure.
B0088W6IMQ|5.0|At first the show seemed a little cheesy, especially after watch sg1. But make it through the first two episodes and you're hooked.
B009LH1Y1W|5.0|supernatural may be dragging out the premise of the show now, but i have to say it is still a guilty pleasure of mine :)  Love this season too.
B00AZL3PBK|5.0|I love this game! I couldn't put it down. It plays just like Mario. It has nice graphics on my kindle fire.
B003OUXECE|4.0|don't know if you'd like it w/o having played the game, but a good filler for those who didn't find every easter egg in the game to explain the story
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|I'm highly addicted to this game! It has great graphics and it's fun to breed different dragons to see what you get. It has the option to buy gems, but its not necessary to play the game and doesn't push you to buy in order to move on. The only downside for me is on android you can't add friends unless your friends play on facebook.
B000YADE04|5.0|It is a bit illogical at times, but it is a fun comedy just the same.  Viewed it in the threatre first, but liked the DVD just as much.
1476733953|4.0|When I first heard about this book, I was under the impression that it's a series of five novels. Its only when I looked up the summary of Wool #2 on Goodreads that I realized my mistake. Wool had originally been released on Amazon as novellas and in five installments and the book that I had was the Wool Omnibus that covered what the first five eBook installments.<br /><br />The setting is that of dystopian. Global warming and its effects have destroyed the earth. What life remains, lives as a community in a giant silo. They live under strict rules and regulations and any deviation leads to \\"cleaning\\". Cleaning is a ritual that each exile performs in order to clean the camera lenses once they are sent out into the open - to their deaths. The story starts with Sheriff Holston getting ready for his turn to go out to the opens. On his death, the Mayor and Assistant Sheriff pick a new Sheriff, Jules, who isn't the most popular choice. From there on the story takes unexpected twists and turns, mainly following Jules and her story.<br /><br />The characters first... I mostly liked Jules. She is a hardworking and practical girl. She's got beauty, brains and brawn. There's hardly a secondary character, but Lucas filled in the protagonist's friend cum love interest well enough. The antagonist actually didn't inspire much fear in me - but that's because I like antagonist who likes to get his own hands dirty, while the one in this book was quite happy to sit back and let others lead into the battle. Though we didn't get to see a lot of Holston, I had an image of him in my mind from the way Jules, Mayor and the assistant Sheriff remembered him. I have a feeling that not seeing him in action is our loss.<br /><br />The plot is a mix of Sci-fi and dystopian. I liked the general set-up of the premise of this novel. There were quite a few loopholes in the plot though that keeps me from rating this book a five star (and also the climax...) But the truth is that I noticed the `misses' only after I put down the book at the end. The author had been successful in sucking me so deep into the story that I never second guessed the printed words. I kept turning the pages to cheer on Jules and for the action.' only after I put down the book at the end. The author had been successful in sucking me so deep into the story that I never second guessed the printed words. I kept turning the pages to cheer on Jules and for the action.
B0018RC7QE|3.0|Not as good as expected, slow moving, a bit boring and quite predictable. Hard to stick it out till the good part.
B0094K1WZE|5.0|it's a great movie fooled action you can really see how bout Tom Cruise Carried the movie on his back Paula Patton was a good surprisethe story development and plot twist we're very interesting certainly worth a rental
B005L38QK2|5.0|One of the best mice I have bought, good weight, functions and buttons. Would totally buy again. The only two cons were that I cant reach all the buttons easily, and that the cord can be a little annoying, especially if you switched from a wireless mouse.
B004AUNSX2|4.0|I enjoyed this movie. I like movies based on true life events. It was kind of creepy but well acted. I would recommend it as a rental.
B007FEFLTO|4.0|Good historical fiction!  A little long, but held my interest.  It's challenging to keep all the characters separate and follow them thru the book, but doable.<br />I like Ken Follett in general, so i read all his books.<br />JCM Tennessee
0767812166|5.0|I love jeff bridges. He was like a little kids coming of age in this exploratory movie. It was awesome!
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|I love this app/game. I was skeptical because usually games on my Kindle/phone bore me quickly. I love city building/strategy games but hadn't found any apps that kept me interested until this one. Jurassic Park builder is SO MUCH FUN.<br /><br />here is what I like: the graphics are cool and you can zoom in/out; the game is simple enough to get started, but detailed enough to engage you in the strategy once you are familiar with it; I can play for 10-min to an hour once or twice a day and not lose track, or fall behind; my kids love watching over my shoulder; so far it is scientifically correct as far as the tidbits it gives you about the different creatures.<br /><br />If you like dinosaurs, Jurassic Park, or strategy and city-building type games you will love this.
B004N6369Y|5.0|loved the book  as i do all of Danielle steel books.<br />its hard to put this book down oncce you start reading .
B000YAA68C|5.0|great movie...P.S. I Love You ...Hillary Swank...just loved this DVD...has it all many great actors and it tugs on all your emotions.
B002R0F3Q2|2.0|not one of her better albums, Vocally and lyrically she is amazing, but usually its only 2 or maybe 3 songs at the most per album that are amazing. I think she need to spend more time between albums to put out another Songs in A Minor
B001UTW7QU|5.0|The first season pulls you into the Fringe world.  I found myself wanting to see the next episode after at the end of each show.  It is really great to be able to stream the series without commercials!  The whole series is highly entertaining.
B004HW7JHE|5.0|Always amazing, but you got to start from season one to get the full effect. must watch to all those who love good TV
B0074D3CAQ|5.0|One of the best books I've read. Harold's walk is a reflection of the paths we all walk in our lives.
B008KMHFJY|5.0|I purchased this book about a year ago and read it in a day, and through the past 12 months I have read it a few more times. Out of all the books I have read this past year (atleast 74) I have not been so attached and felt so much for the characters as I have in this story:I have laughed, cried, become angry, felt sick and had butterflies in my stomach any time the characters have. Absolutely loved this story, just want to read it over and over! Love Travis and Abby's story!
B0087X728K|5.0|Whenever I switch out coolers, I always use this stuff. Way better than the stock stuff on the coolers, and better than anything you'll ever find in a Best Buy.
B003M70O5O|5.0|one of the best shows on tv. lots of action drama fighting guns, who could ask for more? great show
B000NY12LO|4.0|This book kept you wondering till the end. I have read several of Jodi's book and they are very good!
B00BHHIWQO|4.0|A great game for the younger and older ones as well. Makes for a fun filled time whereever  we decide to play it.
B005IQZB14|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book. For anyone who has experienced deep loss and battled to try to regain a \\"normal\\" life, it is a beacon of hope. Through the raw stories the author shares and the emotions that are conveyed right off the page, your own story can be worked out.
B00AEJM6H2|4.0|Enjoy the challenge, but I like  a lot of the games on my kindle, so I do not play this one as often as others.
B004SBS8LA|4.0|this game is so addicting who couldnt like it its a likeable game for everyone and fun too me and my kids love it.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|Very interesting!! Really makes a person look twice, because so many look the same until you take a second glance.
B00BSBT8M6|5.0|This movie seems to have it all: beautiful pictures, intriguing story, meaningful message, and competent actors. It has some good combination of all of that that it makes it both very &#34;entertain&#34; and &#34;educational&#34;.
B005CRY2O6|5.0|I bought this book not because I am a Vegetarian but to have some new and interesting vegetable side dishes. Well, I got just that in this book. Lot's of interesting recipes, good commentary and some beautiful pictures.
B009D0LBRO|5.0|This game has good controls. By using just 1 or 2 buttons, it plays well on the Kindle. Quite a few hours of entertainment.
B000JQU1VS|3.0|I'm a movie buff, so shoot me. its just my personal opinion. But a good movie out weights a good book.
B005LAIIFS|5.0|Great movie and bonus pack!  My son received these for Easter and loves them!  He watches the movie on a weekly basis.
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|As the title says I felt it was a fitting end. Hard to believe a journey of 18 years is over. It was worth the trip. Thank You Robert Jordan and Brandon Sanderson.
B004H4XI5O|4.0|I recall roaming for a good read and the Title got my attention - read the reviews, took a chance and suprise - this was a good read.
B000FBJFSC|5.0|Beautifully written memoir, poignant and a true testament of the human spirit. I loved this book! A must read for anyone
B009LH1Y1W|5.0|Still fighting the devil and hell but great new twists this season. Also great that some episodes are just fighting bad guys and others are developing the story line further. Still a great show! Hope for many more seasons!
B00B2V66VS|3.0|Got this since I had Temple Run 1. But I don't like it as much. The graphics are better but I can't seem to make it more than the first few minutes without dying gets fairly annoying. The extras in the game are a distraction.
B009H5IS1W|5.0|They are keeping you hooked this season with a storyline that you can't miss...keeps you watching until what will probably be the season finale before we find out who the bad guy is! Also some episodes do not involve story line and these are just fun to watch. The best episode so far is Zugswang!
B00BYKIKJS|3.0|Too much bad language, story line was good, swearing did not improve the movie.<br />Casting very good!<br />Acting was great.
B00355L2TU|5.0|Jillian is awesome! This DVD series is easy to follow, allows for beginner and/or injury alternatives. And it is only 20 minutes a day - anyone can fit that in! The results are great too!
B00CDT41RY|5.0|Django was bloody (and, often over the top) but fabulous.  All the characters did a great job, especially Christoph Waltz.  I put it up there with True Grit, Boondock Saints and Departed.  Would watch it again.
1451688091|5.0|Bought this book as a gift for my son as I enjoyed it so much myself.  He enjoyed it as well and it's a great way to educate yourself on important parts of history.
B00B19GKI0|4.0|great classic movie,movies are not made like this anymore For an old movie the quality is very good.<br />I would recommend,this movie.
B000FA675C|5.0|I remember a friend recommending this book to me way back, I said &#34;I don't read those kinds of books&#34;.<br />I was leaving for vacation and she still gave me the book, pushing me to read it.  I took it and read in<br />on vacation - it was the best book I had ever read.......I went on to read all of Dan Brown's books and am<br />now waiting for Robert Langdon's latest adventure to arrive in a few weeks!
B008JMKN4Y|4.0|This book told an interesting story that was hard to put down. Even after I finished the book, I had a hard time not thinking about it. Although, I wish that it would have had a different ending. But, truth be told, I like happy endings in books.
0143038419|5.0|I loved this book and could not believe some of the negative comments on the reviews. The book was interesting, intelligent, eloquent, funny, insightful, and I could hardly put it down.I have been through some of the same experiences as the author, and I could relate to the entire story. I strongly disagree with the people who said the author is a spoiled narcissist. They missed the entire point of the story. So what if she had enough money to take off work and travel for a year. She is a gifted writer, she earned her money, and she bared her soul beautifully in this book.
B00AYHKIZ6|1.0|David Bowie inspired me to become a rock and roll musician; a great joy.  His early work was brilliant, especially when working with geniuses Mick Ronson and Mike Garson.  But he has made in my opinion several duds since then for this rock fan.<br /><br />I put this CD on while working and forgot about it.  Then it quickly started hurting my ears.  Repetitive vocal blatherings ruin it.  He might have made this crap with Eno.  Two thumbs down.
B001NVIZ3E|5.0|This is a timeless film that never ceases to please. It is about human naturethe good, the bad and the ugly and in the end,  good guy wins!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This was an amazing series. I read all 3 back to back on my kindle. I went ahead and ordered the hard copy of the books, because I knew I would want to read them again and again.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|My most favorite bingo game of all time. Now I can't get stuff done around the house.thank you bingo blitz
B009UAO1ZG|4.0|very good read,  lots of new information to me. Wendel Wilke a hero.  We should of been in the war a year sooner.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Worked on this game for 3 days in my spare time and had a blast. Best ever!! Easy in the right places and then it throws a loop.
B000KRNCYY|5.0|love the music, love their versions.  take's me to my happy place with a cup of coffee or a glass of wine!
B005K0HDGE|5.0|Great book!  I enjoyed the story and alternate history immensely!  I recommend this to all readers.  Not just King fans.
B00AB0Z88S|5.0|The visual effects, set design, and costume design of this movie is just phenomenal.  It covers scenery that I can't even dream of.  For those of you that love nature and wild life, for those of you that are actively searching for the meaning of life, this movie is highly recommended.  I feel like I can discover more every time I re-watch it.
B009VTAG5A|5.0|Perfect. Amazing reissue. Would buy for triple the price if I had to. One of the best albums I own
0738711500|5.0|I didn't know a thing about tarot cards or about spiritual stuff in general and in all honesty I didn't care. It wasn't until I saw a cartoon with a character using Tarot cards that I got interested and thought \\"Huh, that's kinda neat.\\" Other books I've read were very thick and and wordy and just made me think the whole thing was dumb. It was a terrible place to start learning tarot from. But then I found this set.<br /><br />I highly recommend this set, it's fun to learn tarot and it can be spooky to read what the cards say when you learn enough of them. After buying this deck I've branched out to other decks broaden my horizon. It has made me popular as well! Men and women ask me out all the time just to get a reading. Yes truly Easy Tarot has change my life. For the BETTER!
1612130283|5.0|My. ole my!! Sexy isn't the word for it.  It stands out and gives the word sexy a different meaning.
1401940676|5.0|love love love this book, while reading the fear of death disappeared completely.  Great read for all who are yearning to BE, rather than trying to be.....
B006QKKMBA|5.0|Will scare the &#34;willies&#34; out of you!  Interesting, but very scary, bloody also, not for little kids though please remember.
B007N5YIUS|1.0|Sure it's &#34;free&#34; and it is only a game, but why must I be inundated with ads for products I have no interest in!
B001GCUO5M|5.0|An excellent move!! Keeps you on your toes during the entire movie. Scary though, but worth watching over and over.
B009GX7IRA|5.0|I'm not going to give information that will spoil it for anyone, but the NCIS story continues and continues well.
B003O5MO2A|5.0|And they had it for a great price! Sounds good, had this on vinyl. Rock on!<br />Favorite tune: Subhuman - The opening song, let's you know what you are getting into, on your feet or on your knees!
B005NKGEP2|5.0|The novel was filled with suspense.  There was an intricate plot which kept one guessing about the outcome.  It was a well written<br />page turner.
0739326740|4.0|This book is quite a tale that I found hard to put down, found it quite interesting even. That is despite it not entirely being believable. There are some interesting elements, secret societies, code breaking and of course the various elements of Christianity. Do think that Mr Brown might have focused a little too much on genitalia though. Had read DaVinci Code many years ago and remembered that I liked it back then. Well, I still like it.
B0042MDAL8|3.0|Kristen Stewart and Robert Pattinson are just awful actors, plain and simple. However, as the series releases its newest movie, you can see them improve. This one was a mediocre movie. Much better than the last two. I'd probably recommend you rent before you buy.
0340896965|5.0|This was shipped from the UK and I was surprised that it came as quickly as it did! In the great condition as posted on the site. I love this story and had to add it to my library collection!
B000FA675C|5.0|It''s an interesting book. I've read it more than 5 times, but never feel bore! It's in the movie but i prefer read it
B002RI9S2Y|5.0|not only for teens, well written and enjoyable! I love the way he uses greek mythology. Will enjoy it more if the mythology is known.
B007BVMVDU|5.0|Here is the main Point...<br />Yes its base on a series of Books, Yes is made by HBO, YES IS ADULT ORIENTED (watch out parents).<br /><br />BUT is as closely related to the Series as it can. Is almost Identical.<br />The series is AWESOME. Intrigue, Love, Power, War.<br /><br />WARNING! First 3 episodes are messy due to the large number of Story line but MAN each one is worth its own series!<br />Just keep watching and you will never be able to stop watching it again!
B00785P2QC|5.0|I love this game. The only thing is that it keeps bugging you about how you need to like it on Facebook. But other than that I love the game and it would be a good game for people who like to play the kinds of games where you have to build and control something.
B00AN0KGWE|5.0|This second Season for the HIGHLY ACCLAIM Series is a Must watch.<br /><br />The Story continues in a VERY good way.<br />You learn to Love some characters, Learn how is how in this power struggle and learn to hate other characters.<br /><br />The series is great, from acting, to story telling, to the sets are just beautifully made and done.<br />Another that is a MUST!
B00881PTRC|5.0|This version of hangman is absolutely fun... not only does it have different themes and tons of different words and categories but it has the funniest animated little hangman to go with it.... every time you get a letter wrong he reacts to it which is definitely one reason i keep playing the game !!!
B009IF8CH6|5.0|OK, I'm a Geek, a real big Geek and a nerd (I know it can be redundant!). but Man I love this series, Funny, smart and it represent in a great way what us of us lucky geeks have to go though. Life in a world that does not completely understand us!<br /><br />WoW got all metaphoric here!<br />Sorry! Back to the Point.<br /><br />Funny, great, smart comedy. If you have not watch it, just sit down and enjoy!
B00BVYLBP2|3.0|This story line is not the kind that can span several seasons.  Once the end of this arc is reached, it cannot go further.  Solve the puzzle and it is solved for good and all.  It's a good show, well produced and acted, and the story is intriguing.  I will enjoy following it to its conclusion.
B0018RC7QE|4.0|I like de Niro  and Streep. So I liked the movie. A simple and romantic story, and two great actors.
B00C1BTWV4|5.0|My son loves all the Jurassic park movies he talks  about out them every day  I will be renting more movies.
B008GVD6D8|5.0|Sencond book and still loving it! Going for the third! It is extremely seductive and intense! Totally recommendable ;) have a good read!
B00C1BU8G2|5.0|I rented the movie for my son because he loves dinosaurs so much. He just crazy about it great movie
B003O86FMW|4.0|Well written and unexpected.  Although this series is somewhat disturbing on many levels, it is also a very well written and thought out series.  Very hard to put down.  These books are not normally the types of books that I read and I was surprised by how interesting they were.
B0042TV4IW|5.0|Introductions are made to our characters mixed with problems to be resolved at the end of each episode.  This is a sweet and innocent look into rural England near the turn of the century.  Strong women take center stage with their hard working men lifting a few pints at the local pub in the evening.  Poverty is a real everyday struggle and the community of Lark Rise while the more well to do live in the small town of Candleford.  I recommend this BBC series that ran 4 seasons.  If you enjoy Downton Abbey you may enjoy this series as well.
B004SRPXWQ|1.0|Amazon should mention that this app will not talk on the Kindle Fire.  I looked like an idiot talking to my Kindle expecting a response.  I will be deleting this app.
B009GEPPYC|4.0|First let me tell you that this is perfectly cast. Julianne Hough and Diego Boneta in the lead parts are a great combination of youth, naivete, and guts. Paul Giamatti always seems to end up as the wise guy manager, but it's a great fit. Catherine Zeta-Jones, Mary J. Blige, and Russell Brand were all entertaining. I have to say that Tom Cruise stole the show though. I thought that was his best performance since Magnolia. He just stepped into something you would NEVER think of him doing and made it real. And he sang too? Whoa! But wait! There's more. He was 49 years old when he did this! It doesn't show at all. He looked great.<br /><br />After the opening first few minutes, I thought, \\"Uh oh. I have chosen the wrong movie.\\" Like the title suggests, it's all about rock and roll. There is LOTS of singing late 80s and early 90s (mostly) rock music. If you don't like that, this will be a harder sell. If you love that and have good memories of those days, it will carry you back in a good way. The story and the way the music is expertly weaved and blended was very impressive. So even though I am not a rock fan, I could appreciate what was done with it.<br /><br />If you are offended by sex, stay away. There is lots of T&A in this movie. One of the best scenes is Mary J Blige and Hough are in the strip club singing Shadows of the Night and Harden My Heart. The songs are good but the pole dancers are amazingly athletic. OMG! How strong and impressive those women are!<br /><br />There are many laugh out loud moments. The singing, dancing, and acting are all great. There is lots to enjoy about Rock of Ages.
B009NF54ZE|1.0|Why can't this be played on the kindle fire HD?  I love their games but most of them I can't get on my kindle and its frustrating!!  I would buy every single one.  Wish they would see this review (I'm sure they won't) and fix it where everyone could enjoy these games!!
B00BKBCF38|5.0|First, let's get past the Satan schtick, and although some fans may not like toying with their carefully crafted image, or gimmick, whichever side you are on, this is a band that has the musical goods that should allow them to excel without resorting to such obvious visual and lyrical nonsense.  I seldom listen to lyrics anyway, and Ghost's rantings and praises of Satan are no exception.<br />  What makes me a fan is the music and here among the '70's hard rock/metal revivalists like Graveyard, Orange Goblin or In Solitude, Ghost, with the exception of Goblin, who rule, in my estimation, are absolutely superb musicians and songwriters.  References to the Blue Oyster Cult are well deserved, and at times this denser more complex followup to their stunning debut recalls the intricate moments of BOC's legendary \\"Secret Treaties\\", particularly on their tunes \\"Subhuman\\", \\"Flaming Telepaths\\" and \\"Astronomy\\", with lush keyboards, smooth vocals and guitar work that is incredibly musical and full of hooks, enough to satisfy the biggest redneck bass tournament in Texas.<br />  Some will gripe because it isn't \\"metal\\" enough, but for the benefit of those ignorant of their metal godfathers, this music, had it come out forty years ago would have been up against John Denver, the early Bee Gees, the first rumblings of disco and flaky acts like Mac Davis or Olivia Newton-John (shudder).  It would have been considered very heavy and extremely blasphemous, whereas today we're jaded to the whole Satan gimmick, maybe with the exception of the most die hard ignorant Bible thumper.<br />  \\"Year Zero\\" is the standout track, with Papa Emeritus' vocals carrying the day.  Time for you, Papa, aka Tobias Ridge of the band Repugnant, (yes, we know who you are) to shed the rubber mask, along with your immensely talented band on your next outing.  You simply don't need that gimmick when your music is that good.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Good game. Has all of the features I wanted in the app.  The only thing I don't like is that with all of the MobilityWare gaming apps, when you start the game it takes you to a ad or video.  The good thing, it lets you skip it.
B00AM2UXFI|2.0|Everything about how valuable a book the previous reviewer wrote is true, but in the three paragraph introduction, I caught SIX typos!  I think two stars is more than generous for this scanning butchery!
B00000JPH6|5.0|I really enjoy this movie, I have bought it 3 times, and gave it out as gifts. Powerful meaning, if you are looking for one.
B000001EHS|5.0|If you're a Def Leppard fan or just a casual fan, this single CD will provide a good dose of their music.  Hits such as \\"Pour Some Sugar On Me\\", \\"Photograph\\", \\"Love Bites\\", \\"Foolin\\", \\"Rocket\\", \\"Rock Of Ages\\", \\"Hysteria\\", and \\"Bringin' On The Heartbreak\\" highlight this set.<br /><br />Def Leppard is one of the best hard rock bands of all time.  This set reflects this.
B00AEFZ6V4|5.0|I bought the video based on the story description, It was very engaging and amazing! My sister loved it, and I will watch it again and again.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|great game; fun and interesting. I love the mini games and the competitions are fun to do. along with the challenges and the new daily ones earn you diamonds
B005LAIIFS|5.0|The story was even better than I hoped! I love that all the forces banded together, and I love the human interaction as well.
B002NHIK1E|3.0|It's a fun show and susally one that I would love. The first seasons back and forth between Elena and Stefan was annoynig but was counteracted with enough plot development that it was ok. The only character I don't like is Bonnie. The I am in season 2 and the actress is ok but towards the end of season 1 her grandma dies and I was unmoved even though I know I should be. I felt worse for Damon than I did for Bonnie. Not to mention the HORRIBLE acting of the main character of Elena. She has improved since the pilot but I am still on the fence. I am giving it until the end of season 2 to improve. There are just too many good dhows out right now to bother.
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|I am waiting till the 2 sequels come out, so I can watch them all together! Just like the trilogy of the rings. I read the book Silmarilian that was awesome too!
B00BGIC4I6|5.0|a great movie about everyday life - highly entertaining. I really enjoyed it and will probably buy a hard copy for my library.
B00139W3NE|5.0|I adore this movie, and it has a lot of action, I love to get lost in the fantasy of the plot.
B008RJ6TTC|5.0|What's NOT to love- All 69 episodes + 24 movies, even 3 episodes of &#34;Mrs. Columbo&#34; (which I'd never heard-of) all on 34 DVDs; packaged in a boxed-set that's the size of 8 standard DVD cases. No onscreen logos.  No commercials.  No overblown menus.  No worthless fluff to inflate the price.  I caught the set on an Amazon special for $56, and I couldn't be happier with it!
B00003CXDD|5.0|It have a lovely story, I love fantasy movies, and this is a great one. Full of action, romance and fun.
B003V40SGS|5.0|I searched all my other streaming video services to find this, and Amazon was the only place I could get it.  This has been one of my favorite science fiction movies over the years.  The music and storyline were wonderful. The cinematography was ahead of it's time in my opinion.  The kids really liked the movie too.  Clean family movie that can be watched again and again.
B009IJJ5B4|5.0|This show is smart and funny.  The characters keep you guessing, frustrate you and make you want to keep watching.
B000FA675C|5.0|I have read this 4 times and liston to it on tape, watch the movie over a dozen times, have 2 copies of the book, a DVD of movie and now on my kindle.  I love it.
B0012QRPU4|3.0|Someone at work told me that if I watched the pilot I would be hooked. The premise is interesting but this is not my cup of tea.
B001BR7CU2|5.0|Guys with bras on their head doing science. Imean how much better and weird can it get. Plus Kelly Lebrock walking out of the haze, now that's a teenage boys dream.
B004KPQK2S|5.0|Secretariat was a miracle horse...a once in a lifetime champion. This movie was so well worth watching - inspiring and heartwarming.
B001BIMYXQ|5.0|Wonderful price on this gem of a collection Greatest hits of Eurythmics. Anne Lenox is amazing. I grew up in the 80s we used to listen to music like this when i was a kiddo. Only good memories of this band. Buy it, Buy it,Buy it now!!! :)
B0025YKDJC|4.0|Certainly made me think how life can be different when we change our minds - when we merely consider the possibilities. Funny story, too
B008JMKN4Y|4.0|I couldn't help but get a little mad at how crazy they act. Other than that I enjoyed reading this book.
B006AN78XS|5.0|A wonderfully fantastic Woody Allen Movie - sort of along the lines of To Rome With Love but with a bit more whimsy.
B00881PTRC|5.0|What sets this game apart from similar games is it makes a simple game enjoyable. The music is top-notch, and the cartoon drawings are cute and funny. The words, though, could be a little more interesting, maybe with movie titles or something added.
B003QSJVV2|2.0|That's how long I put up with it before I finally shut it off. Not my cup of tea despite liking Nick Cage.
B002XWXPC8|5.0|I LOVE THIS MOVIE !!!!!!!!!!<br />This is one of those movies you can watch over and over and not get tired.<br />A must see for any baseball fan!
B004HWT6DO|5.0|Awesome movie. Highly recommend. It brought me up to speed with the entire Facebook phenom of which I was ignorant. Great acting.
B0044DEAUA|5.0|Bluetooth Buddy. Works well. Makes driving safer. I have one for my company vehicle as well as my personal vehicle. My customers and colleagues have to communicate often through the day. This keeps me in touch safely.
B001UV4XI8|5.0|the product arrive at excellents condicion

B009LH1Y1W|5.0|Sam and Dean:  funny, witty, entertaining, human, sexy... how could you possibly want more?  But there is more - underlying stories that carry on their own merit and sharp events that define each day.  Love it

B005UDD1R6|1.0|I have a Kindle fire HD, I try to download some stuff, and was told I needed realplayer to use it, thinking it was the standard for everything, sadly find Kindle has it own player and it is not reconized by anyone  else.
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|Works very well. no problem with the cable use it everyday. It seems to work very well and charges great.
B0050KEVO6|5.0|love the game and laugh at some of the combinations of the elements, I did have to cheat on some of the mixes, I would have never thought to mix some of the combos, it was fun, it is one of the games I actually finished.
B0091REZMW|4.0|This is a fun game to play and helps with memory. The graphics are good and something new is always being addd for more of a challenge.
B007N6NGYG|4.0|This game is fun and makes you think, have redo the some levels just to see how the trains run. good luck.
B008JMKN4Y|4.0|Loved this book! Great read! You hope for a love that can truly conquer all and its a nice thought a man can change for the right girl.
B0058W74UY|2.0|I do not even remember downloading this item, which means  I put it on, then took it right off, meaning it did not work the way I thought it would.
B00BLCHZC2|5.0|Great series, maybe not suitable for young kids because there is sex in it and lots people getting their heads chopped off.
B006JD48NM|5.0|A Movie about a great Man, that was one of the most talented Driver's in F-1 History, who had a laundry list of Victories and the Love and Respect of his Country.<br />R.I.P.  Aryton Senna
B00BWJ7LYG|5.0|Not much to add here other than if you are a fan of the genre this is an epic addition to the amazingly well produced three prior films.  It does the bood much justice and gives you a taste of middle earth again,
B00BHNQ5XK|3.0|The premise of this movie is extremely interesting, though I had a hard time watching it because the movie is so dim. I went as far as adjusting my screen, but it did no good.
B009DMIZM6|5.0|My 14 year old and 8 year old just love this.  It is sort of a go-to movie for them when they can't decide what to watch...I think we have watched it over 5 times together and each time we all agree that it is just plain entertaining and a feel good flick.
B0094M2S5A|5.0|The Big Chill is still one of my favorite movies of all time. I love the music and I love the theme. Awesome
B008QTVNUI|4.0|Kept us going--we watched the series straight through without watching anything else in between.  Good ambiguity about &#34;who is the good guy, if any.&#34;  For comparison we liked Homeland almost as much as we liked Breaking Bad.
B009LH1Y1W|5.0|I have watched every season up until the eighth and I love it! I love the characters and their sassy wit and I hope to see more seasons to come!!!
B004U52VPS|5.0|Bought this for my first granddaughter (when she was old enough). She loves it! I love it because it takes her away from all the 'electronic' crap kids are exposed to. You actually have to reset it yourself! Lots of fun!
B0000669JL|4.0|Great price for great music!  Have listened to him for years & this CD has all the great listening songs!
B00BTYP6QE|5.0|Just like the others and adorable gameplay ... worth the wait.  I love om nom and his very cute little friends
B00005QGAZ|4.0|My favorite of all his albums & this one has added songs. Also brings back a lot of good memories,
B008SVFX96|5.0|I was very much looking forward to this album and I was far from disappointed. From the first song to the last, it rocks all of the way. I haven't heard Richie shredding like this on the guitar for many years -- his soloing is out of this world. It is amazing how creative he is outside of his day job. He still shreds if you see Bon Jovi in concert, but always seems to be holding back on every record since Crush. His voice is strong and his lyrics are often revealing. I have read reviews that complained about the sound quality on this album, but I find that it sounds raw and unpolished -- like a band getting together in a garage and just jamming and having a good time. It has the sound of classic rock, but also has some modern twists with a few sound effects thrown in here and there. I highly recommend this for any fan of rock music.
B003M6WERG|5.0|This is great, I am almost done with the whole season.  My son asked me to watch it, he told me it's his favorite show.  I love it!
B00BSBY38A|5.0|I thought I had this movie figured out until I got to the end and now I have some unanswered questions.  Need to watch it again. Great movie.  Think I need to buy this one for my collection.
B005VZQ95O|5.0|What is not to love about this CD.  Great classic CD of Pink Floyds greatest hits.  We crank it in the house.
B00AMBK6J2|5.0|This was a very funny and entertaining movie right from the start.  It did have a few serious moments but mostly kept us laughing. We watched the unrated version.  Highly recommend.
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|This a story about people.  Set in Ireland in the 1970's, the author relates the story of Jaime McCloone, a dirt poor farmer who has not had a good life.  When his good-hearted neighbors try to get him to meet a gal through the lonely hearts advertisements in the newspaper, we are taken on an engrossing adventure that features heart warming tales and heart stopping tragedy.  How it all ends will leave you deeply affected.
B00BN4URSW|4.0|This is one of Tom Cruise's better efforts - an actor I'm not especially enamored of, finding many of his recent efforts superficial and not especially interesting.  It is very interesting to see him play a bad guy, and a very bad guy at that, and he infuses the role with genuine menace and unpredictability.  Jamie Fox is also excellent.  Well worth watching, as many Michael Mann movies are.
B000IDEQTK|3.0|I felt the movie was just OK. Helen Hunt was all right but not outstanding. The ending was predictable . I wouldn't recommend it to my friends..
B00881PTRC|4.0|This is a lot of fun but you cant cheat like when we were little playing this. Harder than I remember!  I really like the different categories and themes but the music choices are not so great so you may want to mute or turn it down. I would definitely recommend this and it has one or two player modes.<br />Good luck I was hung on the animal quail. lol<br />Florida Mom Real Review Kindle Fire
B000QCS8TW|5.0|This book has everything.  Not only does it have an intriquing plot with lots of unexpected twists along with complex, well developed character; It has zombies, dragons, political intrigue, romance, swordfights, magic, secret agents, lust, deception, ...... the list goes on.  I recently read it for the second time - having read the entire five published books (can hardly wait for the next ones)  and even enjoyed it more the second time.  There were a lot of details that I missed the first go-round.  In addition the book is full of clues and foreshadowing.<br /><br />I would recommend this book to anyone who likes to read, especially people who enjoy medieval history, historical fiction, or liked the Harry Potter, Lord of the Rings.<br /><br />Loved Loved Loved this book!
B000VZYPB4|5.0|Great first season, with the initial character development.  If you are a fan as I am, its well worth picking up a copy of how it all began.
B003B96AOW|4.0|I'm extremely glad that people are back to selling this figure for under 70 dollars! This is a really cool looking figure that looks fantastic on any shelf. The one thing holding me back from giving this five stars is the fact the right leg is a bit wonky so the figure either has to be in it's stand all the time or leaning against something. Well worth the money though!
1451695187|5.0|It was a very interesting book.  He did a good job writing it.<br />I will recommend it to a couple of my friends.
B00BGIBVRG|5.0|I downloaded this movie to watch on a flight from Vegas to DC.  I had to turn it off because I was laughing out loud and the other passengers were giving me funny looks.  Super funny.  I do think you need to be on the other side of 40 to really get this movie.
B00AKKTDJY|1.0|The kindle edition of this Dash game and Wedding Dash is a scam! It's NOT a one time fee! After you've played the dash games for about 20 minutes, it wants more money for you to keep playing! Wedding dash, after 1 level they ask for another 5.99 to continue on other levels. This game lets you play 5 levels then hits you up for another 3.99! Please make a ONE TIME PRICE for ALL Dash games. You make customers feel scammed and it's not right.<br />UPDATE: The 3.99 I paid for to get the other half of the game disapeared. Because you don't buy it at the app store but inside the game itself while playing, there is no where to retrieve your 2nd purchase. I wish there were a place to contact the company making money off of this game.
B00AQO1VYY|5.0|First and foremost Im a huge Mad Season and AIC fan.  The first time I heard above it gave me chills, and I was hooked. After wearing out my many copies of the CD I was wanting more from them  a new album  tour  b sides something.  Well until now  that was almost impossible unless you count the numerous horrible audio and video copies floating around of the brief career of this band. They always say Cobain was the voice of my generation and 100% disagree. For me it was Layne.  And if you listen to AIC album to album you will see such a versatility vocally with him and Mad Season was just the icing the cake to a brilliant but too short of a life of a great singer. Being able to watch this footage remastered is such a huge treat to me and sad at the same time because I just sit there and wonder how much farther he could have went if he could have controlled his demons. Anyways  enough of that  heres my review  disc by disc on this awesome set.<br /><br />Disc 1 - Anyone who has heard the album already knows how great it is so no need to cover the first 10 songs. But this the bonus tracks are one of only 2 things in this set I really dont understand why they added them kind of a ?WTF?  thing. Heres why:  track 11 is a 43 second guitar interlude which is nice sounding but nothing i was thrilled about.  tracks 12-14 is my biggest gripe. you hear the music kick in and you are thinking ok here comes Layne and POW  its not him singing. Its Mark Lanegan.  Ok so he did backing vocals on a couple of the original tracks of Above and yes the drummer from MAd Season Barrett Martin was originally from screaming trees but why did they think we wanted to hear him singing these tracks and being pushed off as MS songs?  Obviously these were recorded after Laynes death which means they were also recorded after the original Bass players death too.  So its mcCready  Barrett (2 surviving members) and Lanegan on vocals?  Bad move in my opinion.  Track 15  is a John Lennon Cover  with Laynesinging and well it sounds great.<br /><br />Disc 2 - Live at the Moore Audio.  Can only say great recording great show.<br /><br />Disc 3 - DVD -  ok heres my second gripe  so first thing you can select on the DVD is live at the Moore  which has been cleaned up tremendously and the audio is awesome. Well its only 7 of the 11 tracks from that show.  But the next option is  unseen footage from the Moore show.  Why not just put the whole show together in its entirety instead of splitting it up for the video.  The complete show is there for the audio.  another ?WTF?  there is also a NYE show on there from RKCNDY  which you can tell was pull from a VHS or low grade cam  but for the footage and the age of it  it is still very watchable  and is a great show itself.  There are a few other little things on the DVD but this is majority of it.<br /><br />I hope this helps.  Please feel free to ask any questions and if i can help i will.  Please enjoy this treasure as this is probably the last thing we will ever see from this band footage wise with Layne.  RIP  Layne Staley  you are still forever missed.
B002HFJ77S|4.0|This was a fun read. Very entertaining with a 1920's twist! Author did a great job of weaving a story that kept you interested through the whole book.
B00C1XZ2LQ|5.0|Haunting, grand, with strong modern synth elements. Reminds me of some of the Mass Effect music, except much grander and more professionally done.
B000002J09|5.0|What can I say, it's Led Zeppelin. More profound awesomeness from the most incredibly talented rock group to ever be assembled.<br />Certainly a turning point for the group as they continue to push the envelope and redefine what 70's rock was to be. Includes the timeless classics, Stairway to Heaven, and Rock and Roll. Just try to sit still to that one, I dare you. Too bad that you can only give it 5 stars.
B00BU8RNCE|5.0|great movie. really loved it, and naomi watts was incredible,  portraying the mother and her strength was incredible. how those poor people had to endure such tragedy and yet come together in a time like that
B00BTYP6QE|5.0|this is the best game ever. play with my friends family and pretty much anyone who wants to.I recommend this app to everyone
B000FA675C|5.0|Dan has proven that all is not what it seems in any situation and this book is a great read with twists and turns that keep you wanting more.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|I loved this movie! Very suspenseful could watch it over and over again! Although I do not think I would let my kids watch it.
B0002NIRIC|5.0|I buy this for my boyfriends who is a electric guitar player, hi was very satisfied. It came very fast to. I was surprised that came very well packaged because is a liquid thing.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Good book to explore the &#34;darker&#34; side of sexual fantasies without having to worry about elements being brought in that are &#34;disgusting&#34; or &#34;too much&#34;. You need an open mind to read it. The main characters come from very different backgrounds, and that should be kept in mind. It's a wonderful exploration of the lighter side of 'taboo sex', as well as an interesting mental exploration. For those who might have a hard time reading such material, I challenge you to at least push through this book. Its contents are actually quite surprising, as are those of its sequels. Plus, your significant other might thank you for the tricks you pick up. ^_~
B00AREIAI8|4.0|It is a good game for girls who love horses. It is very time consuming. And if  you expect to finish the game in one day you would be mistaken.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Love the book. The story's very good. The main character (Ana) angers me a lot. She's kind of an idiot at times--makes extremely stupid mistakes and whatnot. But then other times she's pretty cool, so it's back and forth. It's a great read, and very worth the buy.
B00BFUUMO8|4.0|This game is fun an time consuming. There are lots of cool things that you can do and explore that's why I give this game a great report.
0439023513|5.0|Fantastic read. Very dark, don't expect a lot of humor, sweet moments, or untouchable romance. But it feels very real, making the characters easy to empathize with. Love the series, can't wait for the rest of the movies. I only hope they stick as close to the last two books as they did with the first one.
B00C1BUYX4|4.0|A bit lengthy but gave a good synopsis of the politics involved during the slavery consideration. Same general discussions continue today.
B008JFLWLE|5.0|This app allows me to write with my finger and it translates that entry into legible  numbers.  I would recoment this to anyone who works with  math home work or a math phobia.
B0063GORYU|5.0|I can sit a play this game for hours. Great game. Would  recommend this game to anyone that loves to play card games.
B00B2V66VS|3.0|My granddaughter put this on my kindle.  She enjoys it.  I'm tired of killing the hero because I'm not fast enough.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Dude please make another version then 6.1 please do it I want the rest of the stuff in Minecraft ok
B00AMBLXP8|5.0|Initially I did not think I would like this, based on the trailers for the movies.  It was hysterical and I urge you to watch it, silly, funny, endearing and well worth watching.
B0044C5SCU|5.0|Episodes keep changing based on events.  I love it and my wife got into it too.  Try it, you will like it.
B009VLX8FS|5.0|This is my first Taylor Swift album and I love it.  The first time I heard Begin Again, I knew I would get it for my IPhone, when Amazon sent me a gift certificate for another purchase, I used it to buy the whole album!
B00BJS7104|5.0|I really like this movie.  While a bit on the violent side it also has a humorous side.  It is loaded with a lot of known actors.
B00BI73CVI|5.0|With so many generations enjoying this remake of the timeless story, this one will stand out and be the &#34;standard&#34; that everyone else will try to attain.
B0042TV4IW|4.0|What beautiful scenery and well drawn characters. This show doesn't have the drama of Downton Abbey (though it does have Mr. Bates in an earlier role), however it does have a cast of entertaining, funny characters and engaging plot lines.
034580404X|5.0|My initial reaction to the &#34;plot&#34; for this series was, NOT!!  I bought it for a week long vacation in Cabo because my step sister (who joined me for the trip) wanted to read it.  At first I was not impressed, but wound up reading the entire trilogy on the trip.  Give it a chance, you will enjoy it.....
0307383415|5.0|Powerful and insightful.  Causes me to think about the follies of mundane human existence.  A sentimental book that touches on raw emotions: insecurity, self-doubt, fear, resilience and the constant struggle for survival.  A voyage of spirit not of flesh, in search for an anchor, a place where one might belong.  \\"The Story of Race and Inheritance\\" is an understatement.  It contains much more.  Brings tears to my eyes and by the time I am reading the page facing the epilogue, I find myself sobbing.  I include this title in my tier one book list alongside The Alchemist by Paulo Coelho and Way of the Peaceful Warrior by Dan Millman.  I would highly recommend this book to young folks.
B00AB7HESI|5.0|Hours of fun and I tell my dad its Linda learning because of the adjectives.Love it so so so so so so much. I bought it for a good price.
B000AU9UYM|5.0|I was not at all disappointed with this movie. I knew I just had to have it after I saw it. I was a little weary of there being a new Batman franchise, at first.<br />The action is great, a bit cheesy at times but I think that those moments are necessary. The interactions between Bruce and Alfred are exactly what I would expect. Those two characters are important to each other. I was excited to see Liam Neeson portray a villain who once upon a time meant to change the world in a good way. His performance was perfect, to me at least. Concerning Katie Holmes, some days I have no problems with her role. And... Sometimes I do. * shrug *  Frankly Christopher Nolan makes great films, hands down.
B007ZGO7EM|3.0|What I need in a calculator is everything. I need the fraction bar the most though. I am 10 and in Math Masters and I have a long take home test. Sk I am probably going to fail. :-P
B00BBW16HW|5.0|The French aren't known for \\"feel good\\" movies.  After all, that's wbere we got the term \\"film noir\\" , n'est-ce pas? But this is absolutely not to be missed!
B0046B8GEQ|4.0|One of the best family movies to watch with your children. My neice and I love to replay the Fluffy toy scene
B009KS4XRO|1.0|couldn't figure this game out Not some thing I would recommend for any one Would like more direction could have used some help
B00A1XOPE8|5.0|I am a die-hard fan of Mr. Sanderson's work. I thought this book was incredible, if a little short. It introduced a very interesting magic system amid a Chinese-themed environment. The main character is easy to connect with and you become eager to follow her story.
B000ICRKLM|5.0|I'm a huge fan of Stargate and this one is just as good as SG1.  I love all the characters in it.  It just doesn't disappoint or every get boring.
B007ZXK08C|1.0|Thought it had potential to be a great story but it ended so badly I regretted even reading it ... Worst book I've read in a while !
B009NG1Q96|5.0|It was a good middle to the story! It kept me reading from the time I got off work until I finished! It is a great young adult love story! I just wish America would make up her mind and stick to it! I like that we learn more about the king and queen. Hoping in the next we learn more about the rebels and all the secrets Maxon refers to about things he knows. We learn a few secrets about the royal family, but I really want Maxon and America to get deep in their relationship! Not just I want to be with you, but I need time! I hope everything get tied together and concluded in the next book! Don't make us wait too long! :)
0061980269|5.0|My daughter read this book for a summer program and loved the read. She could not put the book down.
B008Q08EV8|4.0|Hadn't heard of this movie before we watched it (probably because it is a BBC film).  We were pleasantly surprised.  I bit gory at times, but not gratuitously so.  Good story line.  Would recommend.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Can't wait for season four. I love this series. It's getting better every show. Season three was intense. Very good very good very good good good good
B004GHNIRK|3.0|It was kinda hard to get into. but was a good read. the movie and play were wonderful and i enjoyed them both greatly.
B00B2G2RG6|5.0|The Following by far is the most heart pounding, riveting series ever brought to the small screen. Every episode makes you want more and more, to the point of watching episodes over and over just to see if anything was missed from the previous watching. I don't know how they can keep this going, but I'm strapped in and ready for the ride!
B005K0HDGE|5.0|There is so much mystery surrounding JFK's death, the thought of being able to correct a wrong is so enticing but as we find out later on , what a mess was made. Even though our past can be painful, who knows what other pain and misery could be added? The past will always try to correct itself.
B0063M22QO|4.0|I remember playing this game on the computer hours and hours on in. It keeps the mind fresh and helps full dead time.
B0063IH60K|4.0|I like playing this game.  As a retiree I spend much time on the Kindle Fire and love playing games.
B006PTZNSY|3.0|i bought two different CDs from this provider and i was happy with one althought was upset with the other. One CD was in great condition, but the other skipped most tracks
B0063GORYU|5.0|it's great to be able to take it with me on the go! AND the price was just right if you like free!
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|One of the best books I have ever read...and then the sequel was released, wow! I want to have book babies with Travis! Jamie sure knows how to put together a great read!!
B0060CV31C|5.0|This one is the best for adults and kids alike!  It is witty and endearing at the same time......and the actors are a great mix!
B008XG1X18|4.0|This site is both about seeing new things that you didn't even know you were missing and keeping up with you own &#34;keepers.&#34; Check it out.
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|Well written, with vivid descriptions of place and time. We had Irish neighbors and they spoke similarly to Rose. Especially the Grandmother.<br /><br />THIS BOOK  was a treat to read and I would reccomend it to anyone who enjoys heart warming stories with a surprise ending.<br /><br />MARG.
B008393Q2O|3.0|Simple works ok for a free app. I was looking for something a little more detail. But for general notes does work well.
B001NLKXK2|5.0|This book was a choice of one of my book club members and not knowing a thing about the book, I just \\"dug in\\".  Realizing that it was about Alzheimer's Disease, I could feel myself tense up.  My maternal Grandmother and Paternal Grandfather both had Alzheimer's. I am terrified of the disease.  I recognized many of the symptoms described in the book from watching my Grandparents progress further and further into the depths of this horrible, dark hole that is Alzheimer's.  My heart would beat faster as the character forgot simple things, and I wanted to help her remember.  The story was well written, well researched and very easy to read.
B009JZWO3I|5.0|This is annoying rating should be enough but headline and comment are required.  Makes me not bother to rate things.
B008MG1E4A|4.0|I enjoyed this very much. Thank God for these brave men. You have my undying gratitude, and the rest of America's as well, I'm sure.
B004J4WKTW|4.0|I liked this different concept of a circus.  The whole idea of a multi tent venue with acts of all varieties is something I would love to go to!  I liked the characters and the main storyline of the competition between two &#34;magicians&#34; as it kept the pace going.  There were parts of the book I thought were unnecessary but overall I found it to be an interesting and different type of book.
B00BJA2VFW|4.0|I played it thru twice already. The only improvement. I'd like to see is that the game keep track of where you leave off in the free play part.
B004J4WLB4|5.0|I loved this book.  I especially enjoyed learning about the Victorian language of flowers and then putting it in a present day story.  The main character was compelling with all her flaws and the lesser characters were also very interesting.  I would recommend this book to any woman.
B004UNX1LS|5.0|I like this application on my kindle fire. I set it to play several videos and works great. I Enjoy
B004X6PRO6|4.0|I felt as if I had a better understanding of the repressive North Korean culture after reading it.  At times I didn't get where it was going, but then the author would bring it back around to the main story line.  A little heavy but interesting.
B00B2QG3K2|5.0|My daughter loved it, she is a big fan of Paramore. I do like Paramore too (although I am more the 80's). I like the Autorip and downloading in the kindle fire.
B00APUQRPC|5.0|If you love Clint Eastwood, you'll love this movie. It's humorous and serious. It's going to be a sad day when he retires.
B005LHOKFS|5.0|Trip Advisor is a great resource for any travel requirements - it has reviews of hotels, restaurants, and also local information.  Read carefully because the establishments are allowed to put their own ratings on the site.
B00846REIS|5.0|I loved it! I can't wait for the 3rd one!!<br />I'm ready to see what's going to happen next to the couple!
B000X2H8G4|4.0|I used this product in a counter surveillance situation where the property management was allowing illegal surveillance. It's not covert; but probably could be with a little work.  Best compromise for the price.  Its in my EDC pack now.<br /><br />This is my second one by the way.  The original one was damaged purposely by those conducting the illegal surveillance.
1451624468|1.0|This book broke so many laws of logic that a third grader could have ripped it apart.  Really, you cannot call something nothing and nothing something.  Nothing is exactly that...nothing.  Nothing cannot be something and something cannot be both something and nothing.  This breaks the law of non-contradiction and the law of excluded middle.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Very enjoyable. The story starts out a little slow and I was worried it wasn't going to be up to the author's usual great standards but once it got rolling, it was very enjoyable. I think it is one of his more light-hearted stories. The undercurrent is of a good beach read while sipping a tropical drink.
B006LSZECO|4.0|This is one twisted read.  There are so many unexpected twists, and then once you get the hang of the two main characters, it twists again.  I gave it four stars, instead of five, only because I find the ending completely unbelievable.  As in, if this were a completely true story, in no way would it have ended the way it did.  I mean... c'mon!
