B0000524CY|5.0|I saw this movie when it first came out.  I stood in line outside in the freezing cold for one hour and couldn't understand what all the hype was about.  My brother and three other friends finally get into the theatre and the movie starts.  The first scene takes place in Iraq, again I thinking so what.  Then we are transported to Georgetown.  Ellen Burstyn hears a noise coming from the attic and I begin to think OK now the movie is getting a little interesting.  The first time I saw a one second flash scene of the demon I knew this was no ordinary movie.  William Friedkin is a genious. This movie should have won more academy awards then just for sound but the institution at that time didn't give big awards for horror.  They do now ie. The Silence of the Lambs (another great movie).  When I left the theatre on that cold winter day I wasn't the same for a very long time.  I would check under my bed before I went to sleep and put my head under the sheets.  No movie to this day ever affected me like this.  I couldn't believe that I would buy this movie after almost 30 yrs. but I did. I have watched this movie a dozen times and each time I pick up something new from. I always get a kick from it.  One of my favourite scences I can't believe is the scene in Iraq, please listen to the director's comments on the people he encounters in this country.  Another beautiful scene that I overlooked was when Ellen Burstyns walks home and we get to hear that unfogettable music and see the nun's garments flow in the wind.  That is film making at it' best.  The movie doesn't scare me as before but I still get a kick from it.  I now get to enjoy for what it is, a great piece of film making and yes I still jump when I hear that phone ring (if you haven't seen the movie you will not understand).
B00009V7RF|4.0|The Black Eyed Peas are a great group. While City High tried to imitate the Fugees and failed, this group has broken the mold and are just making music...not trying to imitate anybody. Most of the songs on this album are catchy. (ie Let's Get Retarded, Hey Mama, Where Is The Love). The songs you have not heard on the radio are good songs. This CD is really funky (hence the title), and was also a good investment. I recommend this CD to those that like good music. Fergie's vocals complement the songs realyl well.
B00005JNEI|5.0|I just have to say, having seen this film last night upon its release on DVD, that it will soon be joining my film collection, a Bush re-election be damned. This is the most important documentary (and yes, it is a documentary) in my lifetime, in any of our lifetimes.<br /><br />Whether or not you're a dyed-in-the-wool Moore-phile (and believe me, I have reservations about the man), this film will make you think twice about our sitting president. No other filmmaker would've dared to take on the Bushes like this, and Moore should be commended, no, thanked by every American who loves this country and loves it honestly (not the kind of \\"Mommy can never do wrong\\" style of the neocons, possibly the most un-American group since the John Birch Society).<br /><br />I found the film just as powerful as I had heard (living in the South, Fahrenheit had a limited run around here at best, with some theaters not even showing it). The scenes of Iraq during the war (and the human toll it is taking) will break the heart of even the most diehard Bush-lover. I challenge anyone to question the mother who lost her son in terms of whether he died for the right cause. It's all well and good to say that this is a \\"just war\\". Just be sure you're honest enough when it strikes home.<br /><br />The issues I have with the film are the suggestions that we entered Afghanistan to erect a pipeline, and nothing more. That to me is too awful of a premise, too \\"Dr. Strangelove\\"-ian for me to fathom, but I can't help but wonder. Also, the ties to the Bin Laden family are slight, in many ways, but again you can't help but wonder if Moore is really loony or not to suggest them. It's a damning document of the Bush Administration's efforts to have it both ways (stay on alert, but shop), and the inefficancy of the Administration to combat terror in ways that are effective (as opposed to harassing a man in a gym simply because he questioned the President's motives in Afghanistan, which is shockingly something I suspect more commonplace than we'd like to think).<br /><br />Whether this will change anyone's minds (specifically those who plan to vote Bush), I can't say for sure. I'd like to think no one could be so close-minded as to not even consider seeing it, but I've been wrong before. This is far and away the most important movie of this year, and it is a masterpiece.<br /><br />Some might argue, \\"Moore made this film simply to unseat Bush,\\" but after seeing it, I can't say I don't blame him. I want the son of a bitch out of office, roasting on the eternal flames of hell, myself, especially after viewing this film. And if that's wrong or \\"un-American\\" of me, then so be it. We need change, and \\"Fahrenheit 9/11\\" shows us why.mething I suspect more commonplace than we'd like to think). <br /> <br />Whether this will change anyone's minds (specifically those who plan to vote Bush), I can't say for sure.

B00005JNEI|5.0|This movie is a real wake up for Nov. 2nd.  This film either gets a 5 star rating or a 1!  Die hard bush fans (either rich.... or stupid) gave it a 1 regardless what the film is or about.  They do not want this film seen.  After you see it, do some research and find one lie Moore put into this film!  You can't.

0380977788|5.0|This book is a fantastic example of juvenile fantasy in the spirit of CS Lewis.<br /><br />The star of the book, Coraline, is a wonderful young girl. She's mischievous, intelligent, mulish, and corageous. We are presented her world through her eyes - the candor and quirkiness of a young adolescent put quite a spin on our adult actions.<br /><br />Descriptions of the scenery (right down to grandma's uncomfortable furniture), people (the neighbors are so mysterious and interesting through the eyes of a child), and monsters are so real, you are there. Mr. Gaiman has a wonderful talent for building a world in a story, and that talent shines here.
6305499365|5.0|Liberation from the cubical, revenge on your evil boss, settling the score with the copier that just never worked, and flipping the bird to corporate America; what else does the underpaid, underappreciated, accountant need?  Brilliant comedic performances from the brutally honest Ron Livingston, Stephen Root, David Herman, and Gary Cole, help bring out the accountant in all of us, and also shed light on the universal truth we all know deep down inside: work sucks.  You'll laugh, and you'll cry...from laughing that is.
B0002J4ZWS|4.0|In no way do I mean to demean this film. It has been my favorite for a decade and will probably remain as such for a decade longer....or more.<br /><br />My only beef with this set is this - the extras are disappointing. What you get is three features, none of which are longer than an hour, all of which amount to the principals hamming for the camera, talking about what a wonderful film 'Shawshank' is and what an honor is was to be involved. The 'Charlie Rose' show included here, featuring Freeman, Darabont and Robbins, is the most informative about the production, but its hard to sit through four guys gabbing about a movie for an hour.<br /><br />That said, Darabont does a wonderful job with his commentary. However, it was NOT worth paying 18 bucks to replace my old version of Shawshank. The transfer DOES seems cleaner than my old DVD, but not 18 bucks cleaner.<br /><br />Personally, i would have liked a more in-depth \\"making-of\\" featurette. More behind the scenes stuff.
0800177363|5.0|A bearded Robin Williams co-stars with Robert DeNiro in this film based on a true story. Dr. Malcolm Sayer(Williams) applies for a position in the neurology lab in a new hospital. The patients are mentally disabled,one of them being Leonard Lowe(DeNiro). Leonard,until he receives his medication,is not very mobile and talkative. When he receives the medication,he acts and talks like any healthy human being. He meets a pretty girl(Penelope Ann Miller) at the hospital and takes romantic interest in her. His elderly mother(Ruth Nelson) was shockingly surprised about this. \\"He's never talked about girls or had anything to do with them.\\",she says. Leonard,in another scene,after taking the medication,takes the liberty of going for a walk. He is about to exit the hospital when two security guards forcefully stop him from exiting. Leonard's healthy phase doesn't last long. After the medication wears off,he's back to being almost immobile and silent. Other memorable scenes include Malcolm and Leonard wading in the open seas and eating ice cream on cones while sitting on a bench. Leonard's mother thought her son had Parkinson's disease. Malcolm told her Leonard's symptoms were similar to Parkinson's. One of the hospital nurses told Malcolm in another scene,\\"Dr. Sayer,it's a f---ing miracle!\\". The mentally ill patients were all healthy. They're even at a nightclub dancing. Another one of the ill patients is played by Anne Meara,Ben Stiller's mother. This film is based on the book by a real doctor named Oliver Sacks. Penny Marshall,late of TV's Laverne & Shirley directed this fantastic film. Marshall previously directed BIG starring Tom Hanks. By the way,this film was set in 1969. We hear The Zombies' hit TIME OF THE SEASON in one scene. Julie Kavner of TV's The Simpsons and late of Rhoda,plays Eleanor,one of the hospital nurses. Those who saw this film also saw many other films starring Williams and DeNiro,although this is the only one to date that they did together.
B000002JR8|4.0|This album is great songs like strength beyond strength , becoming , 5 minutes,im broken and slaughtered are what make this disc great....Id also like to recommend Burn my Eyes by Machine Head and Symbolic by Death and that is it just go buy now or suit yourself
B000005JA8|2.0|You probably have to be quite good to be this bl00dy awful! <br /> <br />ps. 2 stars because it made me laugh...and I don't know why...
B000063DFQ|5.0|this is the greatest iron maiden album. just for the songs where eagles dare, revelations, flight of icarus, die with your boots on, the trooper and to tame a land could make every album great, but all songs is 5 stars
1401301010|5.0|This is the best book I ever read. It is so detailed and written so well. I love it and if you are a Anthony fan, you would love it too. And you learn so much about him too.
B0002F7I9Y|4.0|If nothing else it gives the world one last chance to hear the greatest singer of all time.  When it's great as on \\"Crazy Love\\" and \\"Here We Go Again\\" it's great.  On the very few uninspiring choices like \\"Over the Rainbow\\" and \\"Sorry Seems To Be The Hardest Word\\" it drags abit.  Though Ray was sick at the end the voice is still powerful and the CD for the most part is pure pleasure.
B0002BO0AS|4.0|Fans of metalcore and European metal will absolutely love this album.  Loaded with screaming vocals, melodic guitar hooks, and energy...this album is just another fine addition to the great year that metal has been having.  So what makes these guys stand out???  After all many new metal bands do the similar thing in blending both American hardcore with the Gothenburg sound of In Flames...Well simply put these guys have perfected the breakdown...Ive never heard anyone do it better than this...you hear a few verses, a chorus or two, then these guys absolutely LET IT RIP, and knock you to the ground with the most incredible, punishing, and brutal breakdowns...every song has em, and each time you will bang your head...you will bang your head hard.
B00029LNHS|4.0|In a world of derivitive and copycat music this CD stands apart!!!  \\"Hey Mama\\" and \\"Where is the Love\\" are great.  This is what The Fugees could've been if tey would have stuck it out!!!  The vocals blend really well, the arrangements are great and the beats rule!!!  Downside is \\"Let's Get Retarded\\" which is demeaning to the handicapped and not exactly politcally correct, they should've just put \\"Let's Get It Started on the original Cd instead of inserting it later and making people buy the CD all over again!!!  The girl singer will make it big on her own if and when she decides to go solo, she can bring it!!!
B0002KVUKM|3.0|Any fans of movies like \\"The Mummy Returns\\", \\"Hellboy\\", \\"The Shadow\\", and \\"Fearless Vampire Killers\\" might enjoy this movie. I enjoyed watching Van Helsing take on Mr. Hyde, Frankenstein, Dracula, and werewolves. Hugh Jackman gives a fine performance as the hero for mankind. Anyone that wants a serious horror movie may find this silly. It was meant to be outragious but I certainly didn't think it was silly. This is more fun to watch than several horror movies I have seen. Plenty of action and CGI effects make it visually great. The acting is decent and the directing and music are okay as well. All-in-all a good action/adventure that has a good pace, wonderful effects, and a good story. I certainly plan to add it to my DVD library long before \\"The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen\\" or \\"The Hulk\\".
1558908382|5.0|Martin Blank is a hitman in the dumps.  He's not having much success in his work recently.  His rival, Grocer, is trying to get him to join his union for hitmen, but Martin enjoys being an outsider.  Out of the blue, he receives an invitation to his 10-year high school reunion.  On the advice of his secretary and his psychiatrist, he decides to go.  He has business in the neighborhood anyway.  Once he gets back, he tries to reconnect with his past life, including meeting his old flame. <br /> <br />This is definitely a black comedy.  The laughs come between fierce gun battles and bloody hand-to-hand combat.  John Cusack is perfect as the conflicted Martin Blank.  He has just the right balance of craziness and sweetness to make this movie work.  Minnie Driver also does a good job as Martin's love interest.  Will she take Martin back?  Will Martin go over the edge?  Watch this great dark comedy and find out.
B000002VCU|5.0|I only say maybe 4.5 because I will no doubt rile up the Woolfson faithful with my opinion that \\"Time\\" is without question the worst APP song of all time. I tolerated it on the radio because at the time very little APP made the radio. But the needless droning on of Woolfson's voice made me want to scream. I am buying the CD so I can skip it.  <br /> <br />That being said, the rest of the album is top rate. Unlike some reviewers I think \\"Games People Play\\" holds up pretty well and the back side of the album might be the best they did, even better than the front side of \\"Tales of Mystery and Imagination.\\" I always felt the singing of Chris Rainbow on this album was tops.  <br /> <br />I highly recommend it to anyone looking for music that holds up over time. This CD should definitely be in your changer in the car.
B00005JNEI|5.0|I was never a political buff growing up, but since my parents both are and my brother works at the Fed. in D.C. I've become much more interested.  With that being said, I loved this movie! Moore certainly has a way of taking all the facts and putting them in a perspective that is very captivating.  kudo's for Moore... Nice job!
B0002DB52M|1.0|\\"Dogville\\" is one of the most excruciatingly boring movies you will ever see; it has a brutal three-hour running time that will have you feeling every minute of it.  Add to this an ignorant, stridently anti-American theme and you really have a dog on your hands.  \\"Von\\" Trier (I use quotation marks because as the critic John Simon has correctly pointed out there are no \\"von\\"'s in Denmark, the director's home country: the \\"von\\" is just an affectation he uses to seem more aristocratic) has never visited America.  He obviously has no idea what this country is like.  The massacre which closes this movie reminds one of the Nazi SS killing squads that roamed Europe just a few years after this movie supposedly takes place, and from which American troops saved \\"von\\" Trier's grandparents.  Similar massacres are of course common in European history and unheard of at a similar time in America.  Nothing in this movie rings true.  Americans generally treat each other with an informal respect and friendliness, which is a far cry from the behavior in this movie.  The airy, abstact dialogue bears no resemblance to real speech between actual people; it sounds like the bad dialogue in an awful book that the character Tom, Jr. would write.  And the strange relationship between the Edisons and the rest of the town makes no sense in an American context; it's like the Edison's are feudal lords or something.  So the movie turns out not to be a representation of America at all, but an inane fantasy of a confused European intellectual.  And the closing credits are the final straw.  Anyone can assemble degrading pictures of any country and set them to ironic music; it's no great trick.  Hell, I'll bet there's even some poor people in Denmark, too.  On the DVD commentary track, \\"von\\" Trier dismisses criticism of the closing credits, simply saying \\"they are facts.  You can't criticize facts.\\"  As if there is no inherent bias in the very act of selecting the pictures you choose to show.  (And seldom have I heard a more pompous, pleased-with-himself commentary track as this one.)  I can't believe I ever defended \\"Breaking the Waves\\" to people.  The director should check his own continent's history of collaboration with fascism before hurling stones at the U.S.  I guess Nicole Kidman's \\"Grace\\" is supposed to be a Christ figure; if so \\"von\\" Trier should read the New Testament scripture about being unable to remove the mote in your neighbor's eye because of the beam that is in your own.eldom have I heard a more pompous, pleased-with-himself commentary track as this one.)

B00005JNEI|4.0|I think the most important thing about \\"Fahrenheit 9/11\\" is: Some big ol' sloppy, public school-educated guy from Michigan didn't like something; he went out and made a movie about it and got people charged up.  Love it or hate it, that is America.  Love it or hate it, he can say what he wants and you can say what you want. <br /> <br />The important thing, I think, is that people get motivated -- one way or the other -- by \\"Fahrenheit 9/11.\\"  Is this movie good journalism?  Good documentarianism?  Not really.  It's more of an op-ed piece and there are things here I agree with and there are things I don't agree with; it's a bit like a lecture you can't stop if you have questions.   <br /> <br />But the important thing people should take away from it is curiousity.  If you think Moore's facts are faulty, dig in and find out for certain.  If you think he's telling the absolute truth, let that motivate you to learn more and you may find your opinion shifting a little. If you think this is a bad movie, make your own.   <br /> <br />Don't be a part of one of the mobs -- not the mob that says \\"oh, it's not a documentary 'cause documentaries have to be true,\\" nor the mob that accepts it just because it's funny and selects your particular target.  Pull yourself away from the trap of being Democrat, Republican, Left, Right, Blue, Red, Green. Love it or hate it, but think for yourself.
B0002ZYE1Y|5.0|I am in LOVE I mean IN LOVE with Nightwish! they are at the top of my favorite bands with Evanescence!( They ties that's how good they are!) I think this is one of the best albums I've heard in YEARS! (next to Fallen by Evanescence). I have all the Nightwish albums and I think this is the best one yet!! I love the way it sounds! I got the 1st version from Finland and I got this one today (just because it had more tracks!!) Nightwish it by far one of the BEST bands around! The lead singer (Tarja Turunen) is one of the best singers I have ever herd! I just wish they hit it big in the US I don't see why they don't. So buy this album you wont disappointed!!! <br />
B0002Z0EYK|3.0|\\"Troy\\", while a very decent film in terms of action and performance, falls extremely short in terms of reliance to the literary text.  Peterson chose to take the story that inspired the Greek alphaebet and remove central characters to the story; the gods.   <br />      I read a review here that said if you have an interest in Greek Mythology to see this film.  This film is not true to the greatest Greek mythological tale there is (arguably the greatest tale).  Any story by the Greeks has the gods as core characters, and because this film had a departure from that I found it lacking.  There are mentions of the gods, and statues of the gods, and I'll give Peterson credit for giving them some notoriety; but their removal is my harshest criticism of this story. <br />      Next, those who have read the \\"Iliad\\" know that it is a 10-year siege, but in this film it is depicted as a weekend scuffle or a bar fight.  Peterson fell very short in this aspect as well.   <br />      What Peterson succeeded in was the casting of Peter O'Toole.  The only reason I give the film 3 stars is because of his very dramatic performance.   <br />      Peterson has a great sense in his directing style, and has put together a mediocre film.  It's something to rent and enjoy for an evening, but not something to add to your library.  If you are a cheap bastard, just join netflix and burn it over a weekend.
B00005JNEI|1.0|So, I saw the movie, thought I would give it a chance as I did with bowling for columbine. It began as if it were a dream, and turned into a nightmare. I apreciate Michael Moore trying to look out for people, but alas he has failed. If he wants to attack something, he needs to go back to yelling at greenpeace and peta. Making up what if's and falcifing stories is just lame. It is sad that people actually belive this is non-fiction. Its all a fake story he invented. Michael Moore is trying to use his massive influence for his political agenda, which saddens me. Funny thing is, he hates Kerry too, so who do his followers vote for? Anyways check out FahrenHYPE911, Celcius 41.11 and Michael Moore Hates America. Those show you all you will need to know about this \\"savior\\". <br /> <br />The film wasn't badly made. It was very professional in presintation. He also proves how creative and amazingly skilled his editing skills are. <br /> <br />I do not respect Michael Moore. Shame on you , and shame on the rest of his followers who worship him relentlessly. <br /> <br />Please people, read a book, think for yourselves, and stop listining to clear channel and the wall street journal. <br /> <br />Thank you for reading my review.
B00005YJMX|2.0|Hello? Doctor I have insomnia. Could you help me? Yes, watch Herzog's Nosferatu. I was cured and now I am able to get a good night's sleep. The pace of this film is tedious. The scenery is nice. So what? So is the scenery on National Geographic Explorer. One of my problems with Herzog is that he doesn't so much make films as much as he simply puts pretty pictures and scenes on film. This is not what cinema is all about. Herzog's Nosferatu fails the litmus test. Watch Psycho or Bride of Frankenstein or Halloween, then try to put this on. The inferiority of Nosferatu in comparison to those films is startling. If I want pretty pictures I'll go to the Metropolitan Museum of Art. I can't believe that people watch this and are entertained. Films are supposed to be gripping, enthralling, emotional. Horror films especially should be filled with suspense and a degree of the unknown. Nosferatu falls flat on all accounts.
B0002XDOBC|4.0|I understand the other reviewers' feelings that this deluxe edition was somehow lacking; even I can grant only four stars in my rating. Having said that, however, I still am enjoying it. I already owned the Mobile Fidelity version (now out of print) with both stereo and mono mixes but, being obsessive, I wanted to hear this remastering. Even though I thought nothing of the way stereo recordings were balanced back in 1967, they sometimes sound odd to me and I find myself now often enjoying mono mixes more (see my review of The Hollies' As, Bs and EPs). I also agree with the other reviewers that perhaps the demos, outtakes and BBC tracks are superfluous (I own BBC SESSIONS as well) IF one has the box set, but for those who don't, they are quite welcome, particularly (in my opinion) the demo version of \\"SWLABR\\" and the BBC take of \\"Tales of Brave Ulysses,\\" which I find terrific. I still can recommend that one should own DISRAELI GEARS, but should finances prevent purchasing this deluxe version, get the single disc. You shan't go wrong!
B000002JSP|2.0|I also wrote a review of how disappointed I was about Houses of the Holy, but when I listened to this album I was shocked.  Nowhere to be found was and inkling of rock, guitar, or decent lyrics.  It was like when Sabbath lost Ozzy minus Iommi's compensation in screaming guitar licks.  If you think I don't know what I'm talking about, just check out my other review I mentioned above.  If you like Zeppelin as they look in 1-4 then listen to a few songs of this album before you buy it, you might save a few bucks.
0141439785|5.0|Read this novel after Far From The Madding Crowd and Return of the Native. It's a very bleak and depressing novel - without the comic flourishes and moments of his earlier work.<br /><br />The story follows Michael Henchard, a hay-trusser, who sells his wife and child for five guineas in an 'auction' during a fit of inebriety. He spends the next 21 years regretting his action, but during that time he does well for himself, becoming mayor of Casterbridge, a rural town. Years later, his wife and daughter reappear. This starts a chain of events that leads to Henchard's fall. He eventually ends up losing everything because of his pride, passion and stubborness. The main character isn't very likeable, but there is something of the tragic about him that commands your attention.
0385510438|5.0|What a fantastic book! No one writes characters or tells a story like John Grisham. I think this is my favorite book of his yet. It's kind of a cross between his thrillers and dramas (like a Painted House-also excellent). The story moves along so quickly I was half-way through the book before I knew it. This is one of the few  books I'll read once a year or so.
6305603847|4.0|The Story: Pink, the main character, has his father killed in the war. This depresses him and the memory becomes a brick in the Wall of many. His mother is overprotective, and he goes to a strict school,in which the schoolmaster embarreses him (he reads poetry which is actually lyrics from \\"Money on \\"DSOTM\\"). He never really gains a girlfriend until he is in his 30's. He becomes a rock star and gets married but he ignores his wife. She cheats on him, which becomes another brick in the wall. Things like this go on, until he goes insane, and shaves his cheast,facial, and regular hair(not to mention his eyebrows.)When his manager finds him out cold, they inject something into him which turns him into a neo-nazi leaderfor some odd reason. By the end, these nightmares become reality, and in his last dream, his is found guilty by the people in his life(the schoolmaster,his wife,mother ect.)and is sentenced to be exposed the his peers. The wall he has built around himself, is torn down. WHat actually happens to Pink at the end, and why children are sorting threw bricks and bottles is unclear, but the  viewer is probably meant to interperet his or her own ending. <br /> <br />It took me a few times too view the film and listen to the live album, to get it, and enjoy it. IT usualy takes me a few times to discover the real brilliance of it. THis film is sort of an anti-establishment type of film, but it can be viewed in many different ways. There is a storyline, even though there is very little diolouge.  <br /> <br />GIve this film a chance to grow on you. I think it should be rated about pg-13, because of it's depressing theme, and graphic depiction of sex. If a 14-year old like me can understand a story as complex as this, then the people who claim there is no storyline, or you have to take drugs to understand it, should take another look, and listen carefully. <br /> <br />The Best moments: <br />The animation is certainly a highlight, but for some reason the part where Pink's school chums walk to the rail-road track, and one of them falls over into dirt, makes me laugh uncontrolably every time. Why didn't they do another take? <br />And why isn't \\"Hey You\\" included?
B00004UEIF|5.0|I would rank this as one of the best jazz records, along with Kind of Blue, Giant Steps, and A Blowing Session. Sublime, but Evans' playing keeps it all together due to his ability to convey different emotions through the piano keys. The gold disc version by Analogue Productions is clearly better than the standard OJC version, and also better than the JVC K2 version. However, the K2 is very good for the money and superior to the OJC version. Listening to the gold disc on a good system, you can really hear the microdetails of the piano and symbols, while the overall sound is smooth and full bodied.
B00009V7P8|5.0|I agree with everyone!  Love, LOVE this cd...I bought this a few days ago, after wanting to get some of his stuff for a while. Light some candles turn down the lights, have a glass of wine and just listen, you will not be disappointed.
B000002J0B|3.0|I own Led Zeppelin 1-4, Coda, Physical Graffiti, Houses of the Holy, and In Through the Out Door, so don't disqualify my opinion as one of a \\"know-nothing rap fan\\".  I bought this album expecting the same greatness as the others.  It turned out to be the biggest disappointment I've had in music I've purchased since I bought In Through the Out Door.  It didn't feel like rock, let alone Led.  Granted, there were a few good songs that I really enjoyed like \\"Over the Hills and Far Away\\", but I felt that over all the lyrics, beat, and over all music wasn't there.
B000002UUX|5.0|Well hard to say anything bad about this album.It's overflowing with energy,creativity,technique and an unbelivable punch!Marty Freidmans solos have such an overwhelming impact on every song on the album,toning down,in contrast of styles,but also in harmony to Dave Mustaines innovative rythum abilities.Dave has never been afraid to cross the line of origonality and almost ****ed up sounding solos and riffs(Meant in a good way).Nick Menza's drum performances are exceptional.It would be strictly impossible to strike a more perfect balance between tastefullness and mindblowing technique and speed.A priceless drummer!David Ellefson shows occasional very impressive melodys through his bass riffs and remains tight with the other complex musicianship throughout. <br /> <br />I don't listen to much Megadeth anymore but this album fascinates and blows me away,time and time again.Dave Mustaines vocals can be a little hard to take but suit the songs.This has to be,for musical value, the best thrash metal album ever!You will never hear better melodic solos then Freidmans,in this album.Promise!
B0002KQNL8|5.0|I dont know maybe im the only one, but i like my \\"zombie movies\\" to actually be about zombies. I know this sounds insane to you but try and stick with me, I saw a movie going by the name of Resident evil 2, this sad sad movie was more about bullet time and wire fighting than zombies and the T virus (remember the T virus!?). Last time i looked resident evils main focus was to be a video game tribute to night of the living dead, thusly zombies should be a huge part of the plot, not just a side note to it. That being said Return of the living dead 2 is an A+ classic zombie film for any horror fan. This movie is both funny and gore filled, thats hard to do in a movie about zombies. Though I will agree that the first movie is by far better than \\"return 2\\", this movie is better than most horror movies that came out in the past 10 years. Buy this now! make Tar Man happy <br /> <br />Stop watching modern hollywood crap and get a classic.
B00005JKGO|5.0|La Dolce Vita is the outcome of a crossroads for Federico Fellini as Italian neo-realism influenced him prior making this film, Variety Lights (1950) and I Vitelloni (1953).  After La Dolce Vita Fellini's creations became more extravagant and dreamlike as the films often became some sort of allegorical celebrations to mankind such as the autobiographical 8 ½ (1963) and dreamy Juliet of the Spirits (1965).  This crossroad is heavily influenced by a search for something, maybe happiness, which is depicted through the main character, Marcello Rubini (Marcello Mastroianni), who drifts from day to day with no particular existential ambition.<br /><br />Marcello, a gossip columnist, works the upper society creating stories built on rumors supported by pictures taken by his friend and photographer, Paparazzo.  A side note is that Paparazzo's name is the origin for the name of paparazzi that now stalks the famed and fortuned.  Marcello's job has driven him to a soul search as he finds himself short of qualitative accomplishments and good deeds, which leads him in some sort of despair.  The despair is augmented through Marcello's work that provides several opportunities to act upon his sinful desires.  Marcello is led into a continuous negative cycle, as he does something good that is shortly followed by a sinful act.  This is how Marcello searches for a meaning to his existence as it becomes painfully evident that he searches in all the wrong places as his desires leads him astray.<br /><br />At home Marcello has a heartbroken and suicidal fianc&eacute; that needs his love, but never fully receives it as he desires other beautiful women such as the voluptuous starlet Sylvia (Anita Ekberg) and the aristocratic beauty Maddalena (Anouk Aim&eacute;e).  Despite his desire for other women Marcello longs for the strong connection of a family as he envies his friend Steiner (Alain Cuny) and his seemingly perfect family.  Marcello tries to seek redemption to his wrongdoings by nurturing his fianc&eacute;, yet restlessly he wonders what he might be missing.  This leads him to continue to search for something to silence his internal desires, which seem infinite.<br /><br />Fellini displays his artistic brilliance as he displays Marcello's lost character through strong allegorical connotation with several different themes such as Catholic values, greed, desire, and existentialism.  These themes are essential to the story as they reflect the identity of Marcello who, in essence, does not understand himself as he attempts to find an answer to life.  Thus, Marcello's own confusion of self reflects his own dimwitted search for a meaning to his own life in places other than himself.<br /><br />Fellini directed a brilliant film with much to ponder and contemplate as most shots leave most of the story for the audience to reflect upon.  For example, most scenes are left open ended such as when Marcello stays in a prostitute's apartment with Maddalena behind closed doors.  The audience wants to think they know what happened, but they will never really know what happened behind the closed doors.  The brilliance of La Dolce Vita lays in the clarity in which Fellini describes the ambiguous as the complete interpretation of the film is left to the audience.  The result of the cinematic experience is an artistic experience that encourages thought and reflection upon life and self, which is nothing but brilliant.ring his fianc&eacute;, yet restlessly he wonders what he might be missing.

B00005JNEI|5.0|Some love Michael Moore; others hate him. Hopefully we can all agree on at least this much: because America allows freedom of speech Michael Moore was able to make this film and find help getting it to the public.<br /><br />As we know, in Fahrenheit 9/11 Moore decries what he considers to be Bush's lack of initiative to prevent terrorism before the fateful September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks on our nation. He then proceeds to demonstrate that the Bush family had long standing business ties with the Saudis. He cites sources (including, of course, Richard Clarke) to demonstrate that the Bush administration intended to attack Iraq from almost the first day they took the White House. All in all, this film is Moore's scathing attack on the Bush administration and the Republican party for what he sees as their lack of true concern for the welfare of the American people, putting their personal business interests above everything else. Moore also attacks Cheney for his connections to the Saudis through Halliburton as well.<br /><br />I admire Moore for his bravery in taking on the powerful Bush family. Freedom of speech allows this and Moore had the right to make this film just as anyone has the right to speak their mind in our nation.<br /><br />There are times in this film when Bush does look inept, as when he takes seven minutes to have any response to the news from his chief of staff that the second of the two twin towers in NYC had been hit by a plane. Moore takes great pains to interview soldiers in Iraq and he succeeded to getting them to truly open up about their feelings both pro and con against the war. It was especially refreshing to hear the candid mixed feelings soldiers had about the Iraq war since our news media typically does not cover that angle of this story. I personally felt broken hearted for Lila Lipscomb, the mother of a son killed in Iraq. Moore succeeds in bringing an emotional element to this film both through the soldier interviews and the interviews with Lipscomb. It makes one wonder about the necessity of this war, especially in light of the fact that no weapons of mass destruction were found in Iraq. (Indeed, on this afternoon's CNN.com web site there is a major story as I write this that \\"top U.S. arms inspector reported Wednesday that he found no evidence that Iraq produced any weapons of mass destruction after 1991.\\") One thing was absent, however: never once was it mentioned that Clinton also ignored terrorist warnings for a long time--it wasn't just Bush!<br /><br />The DVD comes with a slew of extras that are also very captivating and interesting to watch. One extra was filmed outside the now infamous Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq the day they released 100 prisoners. I was disturbed at the prison abuse they received. Perhaps American soldiers over there have to be extremely careful and protect themselves by rounding up potential resistance people; but prisoner abuse is not the American way and it brings us down. We also see Condoleezza Rice's 9/11 Commission testimony as well as Bush saying not much after a \\"conversation\\" with the 9/11 Commission. There is a troubling look at the inadequate security patrol of the coast of Florida as well as the lack of protection in Oregon state.<br /><br />I recommend that people see this film if they can. The DVD and extras are thought provoking. If you agree with Michael Moore, then it will make you feel great that he got his message across. If you disagree with Moore, see the film anyway--a thorough understanding of his stance will help you think and sharpen your opinions and beliefs to the contrary. Moore has indeed made a significant contribution to the very hot issues of the Iraq war and politics as it relates to big money and big business. SEE IT!e interviews with Lipscomb.

B00005JNBQ|5.0|I have to say this movie was quite the surprise.  I watched a trailer for it months before its release and was already hooked.  Jon Heder's Napoleon Dynamite was absolutely brilliant.  Here's a guy that could easily win the award for World's Biggest Loser but seems to feel he is quite the dynamo.  Performances and dialogue were some of the funniest I have seen in years.  Definately something worth owning or at least seeing multiple times...
B00006CXSS|5.0|Based on the book by Stephen Ambrose, \\"Band of Brothers\\" details the story of Easy Company in the 101st Airborne Division during World War II.  As most films do, it doesn't stay completely to the book, but it does very well in staying in harmony with the book and its accounts. <br /> <br />All accounts and stories aside, this mini-series is extremely well made.  The scenes, while graphic at times, are something to behold.  The artillery shells screaming in, the tracers flying, and most of all, the great portrayal of a soldier done by each actor, make each scene feel real to the viewer. <br /> <br />There really is no standout as far as the \\"leader\\" of the film.  Mainly because this is a movie about an entire company.  But the one that would probably take the honors is Richard Winters, played by Damian Lewis.  Throughout the series, you see his progression from Lieutenant to Major and the leadership he shows in the company, but still remains just another man in the company. <br /> <br />Throughout the series, you will witness Easy Company from D-Day right through to the end of the war.  This includes events such as D-Day, Operation Market Garden, the Ardennes, among others.  The several parts of the series that are in the Ardennes are spectacularly made.  One thing that really sticks out in my mind with these different battles though, is that Easy Company and the 101st Airborne could have been glorified to be this unstoppable force that ran over Germany.  But they were shown to be human, shown in victory and defeat.  But also shown to be together.  As the name would bring out, their closeness and not wanting to lear each other down got all of them through some of the harshest fighting seen in World War II. <br /> <br />With each passing year, more and more veterans from those battles leave us.  But those that are still here retell accounts at the beginning or end of each episode.  Seeing those men as they are and seeing their reality really strike a cord in you and make the film even better.  At the end of the series, you are shown the names of those being interviewed.  It really is funny, after you've seen the series and start seeing the real men's names, you point to the TV screen and say \\"Look! It's Lip!\\" <br /> <br />All in all, it's a great series.  Very well made in both the acting aspect and the reality aspect.  The only thing close to Rambo in this film is Ronald Speirs.  There are some great performances by the actors, such as Donnie Wahlberg playing Carwood Lipton, Frank John Hughes playing Bill Guarnere, and Rick Gomez playing the lovable George Luz. <br /> <br />Check this one out, you won't regret it.
B00005QGAZ|5.0|Regardless of your own personal taste in music, this album has a little bit for everyone. Spanning the waters with songs for \\"Billie Jean\\" to \\"Beat It\\" this album isn't just great for the hits. Songs like \\"Baby Be Mine\\", \\"P.Y.T.\\", and \\"Human Nature\\" are also equally amazing. The special edition has some cool features like interviews and unrealeased songs (\\"Carousel\\" is great!) but its best feature is the very rough home demo of \\"Billie Jean\\". If you only by one album, this is it!
B0002OERI0|5.0|This is a must buy for every green day fan. it's an awesome album with good songs.
B0002KQNL8|1.0|I read the reviews below and still bought this thinking \\"so what, how bad can the new track be?\\" BAD. The entire music track has been replaced with tooting techno-pop circus music. Not just songs, but every little piece of musical sound used to create tension is replaced. So, for example where you used to have a scary scene that had a wall of violins playing and sharp scary sounds to help the scene, you now have tooting circus music that sounds like it was produced on a $50 Sears keyboard. To the people below that said \\"so what\\", switch it over to the french version when you hear the tooting, and hear what its supposed to sound like. Why Warner would do this is baffling (obviously they have the rights to the sounds, since they are still there in the French track. Also, I have never heard of the rights to a movie being seperate from the background music).
B0002ZYE1Y|5.0|First Part: <br />  Nightwish, the most succesful Finnish band are back with their 5th album, Once. Just like the import version, this will probably get many confusing reviews so I'll try to help. <br />First, about Nightwish. <br />  In the mid 90s, Nightwish appeared as a Power Metal with Symphonic elements that had Tarja Tarunen A professional Mezzo Soprano as frontwoman. Their first album, \\"Album fall first\\", is actually a good album but doesn't have a good production. Their next album, \\"Oceanborn\\" is an excellent release with a better production. Tarja's performance is awesome.  <br />Their next release \\"The Wishmaster\\" is considered by many their best album. Is certainly the most \\"Power Metalish\\" but it doesn't lose the atmosphere. After \\"The Wishmaster\\", Nightwish comes out with \\"Century Child\\" which was a big change. The guitar work almost dissapeared, the Operatic vocals almost go away showing another style from Tarja and the band becomes more quiet plus they added a second vocalist (Marko Hietala who is also the bassist). Now to me, \\"Once\\" is pretty much \\"Century Child\\" mixed with \\"The Wishmaster\\" which is great. Tarja adapts her voice to the new style better than in \\"Century Child\\" basically because Toumas Hollopien (Keybordist and songwritter of most of the material) wrote the music in a way that they can fit with Tarja's voice.  <br /> Songs like \\"Dark Chest of wonders\\" or \\"Nemo\\" are actually Power Metal songs but that have the atmosphere of the new Nighwish. Epics like \\"Ghost Love Score\\" show the orchestra that worked with Nightwish for this album more than the other tracks and \\"I wish I had an Angel\\" show the alternative ideas being a track with heavy riffs and a \\"Techno Beat\\" that sounds like an Industrial Metal band. <br />\\"Once\\" is a good album for old and new fans of Nightwish. I recommend it. <br /> <br />Second Part: Well, \\"Once\\" is a very successful album. It got first places in European radios and it has sold a lot of copies. The most successful album by Nightwish to date. However, Nightwish has some detractors. The main detractors of Nightwish are some Metal music fans that don't like Nightwish because they are not heavy or fast enough. In terms of speed and virtuosity, Nightwish can't match other Finnish acts like the Power-Melodic Metal bands \\"Stratovarius\\" and \\"Sonata Arctica\\" (Both very good bands) or the Power-Black Metal band \\"Children of Bodom\\"(Another awesome band) however, remember that virtuosity doesn't always mean the best music. I'm not saying that Nightwish doesn't have technical quality. Certainly, all their members are stronger than the members of Evanescence and also Nightwish is more technical than the incompetent Nu Metal bands that you can find in the American Radios. However, compared with other Metal acts, they are a kind of weak but they still play awesome music. <br />The idea of putting Metal and classical music together began way before Nightwish, however Nightwish is still original. Just like the Import version, here, there will be some reviews that will mention \\"Symphony X\\"(Another awesome band indeed) as a better alternative. Symphony X is not even the same music. Sure, the members of that band are extremely talented and they are monsters with the instruments. The guitarist there, Michael Romeo, is one of the 5 best guitar players in the world today and all the other members play more complicated material than Nightwish but as I said, Nightwish is different and can play good music without so much technical quality. There is a possibility that Nightwish will become popular here in the United States (They are already very important in Europe) however, the American music industry doesn't want foreign bands to get popular here. Even the British bands don't receive publicity. I personally think that keeping the American people unaware of the good music is disgusting. American Mainstream music is in its worst moment. There is nothing but crap and Nightwish is an excellent alternative. Unfourtunatly, some rich forces try to keep this album away from the American people. How? They don't play the songs in the radios (Most of them owed by the same two companies) and well, this is just too good for MTV. <br /> <br /> Buy this album and spread the word. There is awesome music out there that is way better than the lame Nu Metal. Nightwish is an excellent band and this is one of their best works to date.
B000006TRV|2.0|I saw the movie soon after high school and was duly impressed:  the animation was spectacular.  The movie was dark story concerning the growing emotional detachment and isolation of a rock star, Pink, who gradually descends into a fantasy world of fascist leanings.  Perfect stuff for highschool I thought and a story that lent iself very well to the big screen.  However, even though Pink Floyd was one of my favorite bands since Meddle, I never bought the album.  I'd heard it to death from my friends and though I was impressed at first, I became less so with each subsequent listen.  The Wall has a lot of problems, both in its scope and in its execution.  As a larger work, the concept is derivative of the Pretty Things far superior SF Sorrow (the first rock opera):  the alienation of a boy who loses his father in WWII and his emotional breakdown.  Musically, most of the songs with a few exceptions (Comfortably Numb is among their best works) seem to be filler: they perhaps further the storyline but aren't that compelling. In fact many are dull.  Perhaps this has something to do with the fact that Roger Waters hogged the song writing and prevented Rick Wright from making any musical contribution what so ever, which led to his leaving the group during the recording. Perhaps this has something to do with the over the top production of Bob Ezrin, surely the most overrated producer on the planet.<br /><br />Pink Floyd for me have since the Syd Barret days been primarily about the music, which was often groundbreaking and moving.  I've never given their lyrics as much weight although some were excellent, but for me they've always been secondary to the music.  With the Wall the lyrics are the main focus, the music takes a backseat and the album suffers for it.  There is a tremendous amount of filler music whose only purpose is to act as a backdrop to the lyrics/storyline.  With some notable exceptions, the music is either weak piano noodlings or overly theatrical bombast with little subtlety.  Which of course something that producer Bob Ezrin is known for.  Most importantly The Wall just doesn't sound like Pink Floyd.  After the wonderfully complex and even darker Animals, I expected more of the same sonic density, but instead I got what is essentially a Roger Waters solo album with help from the other Floydians and studio musicians.<br /><br />The plot of the Wall is unoriginal and just too long and ultimately boring.  It's just so much puerile pop-psychology about building an emotional wall because school sucks, Dad died and Mom is overprotective and then tearing the wall down, who cares?  The Wall doesn't move me at all, it's story pretentions are too facile, it's music too showtune grandiose to move me in any significant emotional way.  Unlike previous Pink Floyd albums, the Wall sounds childish, not childlike, and less adult.  It's whiny, self absorbed and worst of all maudlin.  There's a silly and cinematic or theatrical drama to the whole thing that I find very unappealing and cartoonish.  As a movie the Wall was more successful because of the visual element and tremendous animation, but as an album, well...  The music isn't very interesting: its mostly filler and bombast, and the storyline is just so much depressing and self-absorbed navel gazing.  Just get over your pathetic rock star self Rog.  After the Wall the Floyd as far as I was concerned was over, they never did anything that interesting again and Roger Waters solo career has been one bomb after another.  The Wall marks the death of Pink Floyd as a viable band.  Download it or rip it from a friend.e subtlety.  Which of course something that producer Bob Ezrin is known for.

B00005JNEI|5.0|Michael Moore is partisan.  He has never stated otherwise.  He is honest and truly wants to see all Americans do well.  This documentary is moving, interesting and give you insight into the things that the Republicans are really doing.  The Republicans have many average everyday people fooled into thinking they are with them and for them ... They are not!  They cater to the wealthy and the elite.  Michael Moore sees this and about half of the country sees this.  I would recommend Michael Moore's books and documentaries to anyone ... but don't just accept his info.  Read other information and get a well rounded view of what is happening in this country at the hands of the Republicans and how they are wreaking havoc all over the world for selfish gains ... not for the American people.  Farenheit 9/11 is a great documentary and should make anyone with half an ounce of a brain think!
B00005JNEI|5.0|This is pure genius.  Great movie.  A wake up call for true democracy.  Also higly entertaining.
B00005JNEI|5.0|Hi Folks,<br /><br />What this movie reveals about the Bush family and their business dealing with the Saudis is enough to make you throw-up! I cannot believe that they got away with the GRAND cover-up and the lies they have sold to America. The one thing you walk away asking yourself is, \\"What can YOU DO\\" to make a difference. Michael Moore has clearly blown the lid off the corruption this time round! This movie is a MUST SEE IMO! With the November elections just around the corner, we all have a chance to have our voice heard and with any luck this time around, with whom we really want in the White House.<br /><br />A must see movie and at the right time!<br /><br />Ciao!
B00005JNEI|5.0|In reading the reviews currently available on Amazon, it makes me sad to see the number of people that are unable to set aside their own personal political dogma to see the brilliant job Michael Moore has done with this movie.  When a director takes on a project, his goal is to relay the emotions and themes he chooses to his audience in the most effective method possible.  Moore has succeeded in this film to a degree rarely achieved by most filmakers. <br /> <br />There are two major camps of critisism with respect to this film.  The first claims that Moore's film is factually inacurrate.  Moore certainly uses the film to support a political agenda, but his pain staking fact-checking belies critisism on this front.  Those claiming a large number of factual mistakes are simply so wed to their own dogma as to make their ability to freely view any information that critisizes their beliefs impossible.  These are dangerous people, for they are willing to disregard truth and relpace it with blind faith.  This is all right (and actually essential) in a religeous context, but unforgiveable in a political context. <br /> <br />The next group critize Moore for not making an unbiased film.  These people miss the point.  Moore wasn't trying to make an unbiased film.  He did a brilliant job of making a very biased film.  That was his intent.  Anyone hoping to be successful in making films themselves should watch this film intently to see how much it takes to be so successful in achieving one's vision. <br /> <br />As a vehicle for Moore's vision, this is a brilliant film.  Proof is how well this film has connected with the general population of this country.  As much as people who disagree with the philosophy of this film want to Bushize the film (that is, keep repeating that it is a bad film over and over and over in the belief that if you say it enough times it becomes the truth), it is a magnificently directed film; and one with important lessons, even for the people that areoffended by its partisanism.
B0002KQNL8|1.0|The people who put out this DVD have totally messed up the soundtrack. It all has to do with noise.  First off, there's different music in the movie.  Next, there are all these new and odd sound effects that are out of place.  Why bother releasing the DVD at all, if they're not going to do it correctly???
076790592X|1.0|Now I know that being a #1 bestseller does not guarantee quality, but reading these customer reviews left me speechless. \\"Tuesdays with Morrie\\" is, without a doubt, one of the poorest novels I have ever read.

Mitch Albom writes like a 5th grader: \\"At this point, I should explain what had happened to me since the summer day when I last hugged my dear and wise professor and promised to keep in touch. (paragraph break) I did not keep in touch.\\" What is that? I have not seen this style of writing since middle school, seriously. But forgetting that, it seems that many people like this novel for the lessons that Morrie passes along. I'll save you time and energy by telling you that these \\"lessons\\" are little more than trite epitaphs that you have read in every pamphlet about dealing with grief (\\"Learn to forgive yourself and to forgive others\\"). This book is allegedly beneficial for anyone who has watched someone die. Well I have, and I was frankly offended by how juvenile and ridiculously sacharrine this novel is. For the love of God, stop supporting Mr. Albom. If he continues to make this much money, he might write another book.
B00008OWZC|5.0|This is quite possibly the best set of CDs that I've ever listened to.  I wasn't a big Led Zep fan before I got this, but I certainly am now.  I personally like the recorded Stairway to Heaven much better than the live version, but that's the only thing I have against How the West Was Won.  The songs have so much energy, it doesnt get much better.
B0001I561E|5.0|I was 13 when this movie first came out.  When I saw the trailers for it, I was sure it would be really stupid, but when I saw it, I fell in love with it.  It is, in my opinion part of Disney's best years.  My favorite movies from Disney fall somewhere between The Little Mermaid and Mulan (with a few in the middle I didn't like).  Robin Williams makes a great genie.  His comic timing is great, and being in a Disney film, his jokes are clean as well.  Jafar is a great villain.  He has the snakelike smoothness about him that is great in a villain.  He also has a great voice for a villain.  This movie is definitely one you want to watch.

B000002GY9|5.0|First off, I think this entire album is excellent, from the tormented \\"Tom Traubert's Blues\\" to the hysterical \\"The Piano Has Been Drinking\\" to the mellow \\"Jitterbug Boy.\\" But even if abovementioned tunes did nothing for me, it would be made with the title track. <br /> <br />\\"Small Change\\" is one of the most chilling tunes I have ever heard. The combination of Waits' raspy voice, the instrumentals being a lone saxophone, and the bleak lyrics describing the crime scene and the gunned down gambler are more haunting than any ghost story you were told as a child. This is Tom Waits at his poetic best. <br /> <br />The bonus is that while this song steals the show, there is plenty to enjoy on the rest of the cd. The mood of the album gravitates toward the down & out pool hallers, hucksters, and all-around tormented souls. From heavy to humorous, this release has it all. <br /> <br />\\"Pasties and a G-String\\" is a hysterical salute to the old burlesque haunts, and the dancers and droolers that inhabit them. Like \\"Small Change,\\" the focus is on one instrument, the drums, albeit in an entirely upbeat manner. <br /> <br />Other standout pieces are \\"Jitterbug Boy,\\" a rare calming piano piece, singing the Jitterbug Boy's unlikely claims of places he's been and people he's met; \\"The One that Got Away,\\" another hard-boiled hard-luck song showcasing some wicked saxophone, and \\"Invitation to the Blues.\\" <br /> <br />This is easily one of Tom Waits' greatest efforts, though you can't go wrong with any of his earliest albums. Like I said, everything here is excellent, but \\"Small Change\\" alone is worth the money. <br /> <br /> <br />
0553121448|3.0|We were so excited to get this sequel to Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, but were quickly bemused and disappointed.  The first half takes up where the previous book left off, with Charlie, Grandpa Joe and Mr. Wonka in the glass elevator, and it quickly gets bizarre, but not necessarily in a good way.  The elevator goes into outer space and the president comes into the story and a spaceship, and we get too many distractions from Charlie and Wonka.  The second half is better, but I would not recommend this sequel.
B0002OXVDW|4.0|Upon its release \\"That's Entertainment!\\" became the biggest and brightest money maker of 1974...and it's no wonder. For a little over two hours one had the enchanted experience of being teleported to a world just this side of over the rainbow. Here is a cornucopia of magical scenes and snippets from MGM's most magnificent musicals. Directed with adroit - if self congratulatory - wit and concision by Jack Haley Jr. (son of Oz's Tin Man), \\"That's Entertainment!\\" is the sort of blindingly spellbinding extravaganza that reinforces MGM's once galvanic mottos of \\"art for art's sake\\" and \\"more stars than there are in heaven.\\"  At its gala premiere Jack Haley Sr. was heard declaring, \\"This isn't nostalgia. This is art.\\" Rightly so, by 1974 the MGM musical had been dead for some time and the studio itself was on the verge of a restructuring that would ultimately reduce its holdings to garage sale status. But at least in this film such forgotten treasures were resurrected from oblivion to their rightful place in film history. Variety gave \\"That's Entertainment!\\" a glowing review, trumpeting, \\"That while many may ponder the future of Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, no one can deny that it's had one heck of a past!\\" <br /> <br />Naturally, MGM just had to have a sequel. Two years later \\"That's Entertainment II\\" came out. But David Melnick's follow up was decidedly a let down on several levels. First, it removed the star cameos that so poignantly buttressed the original's vintage clips. Second, it presented the footage in a seemingly hap-hazard chronology. And finally, it interrupted the musical performances with a showcase from some of the studio's non-musical performers in a string of disjointed word play that neither enhanced the memory of their original performances or the film experience that was to be had. Though not nearly as successful as its predecessor, \\"That's Entertainment II\\" was nevertheless a box office titan.   <br /> <br />In 1994 MGM once again revisited its vaults for \\"That's Entertainment III\\" the final installment in the series. But by now the experience was vaguely beginning to resemble grave robbing. The new film's primary selling feature was that, in addition to showcasing another round of classic performances, it also dug deep into the coffers of outtakes for a series of deleted musical numbers which, until 1994, had either never or rarely been seen. Despite these innovations the final installment to the trilogy was the one most poorly received. It's the original that continues dazzle us all and it's the original that remains the cornerstone of this newly minted DVD box set. <br /> <br />Warner's DVD transfers of all three \\"That's Entertainment!\\" films is a welcomed delight. After years of viewing parts one and two with poorly mastered vintage clips, these newly minted discs appear to have been the benefactors of some digital restoration. Beginning with the original film, there is a decide lack of grain and grit on this transfer that is most becoming. Colors (during the Technicolor clips) are vibrant, rich and deep. B&W images are very crisp, nicely balanced, with an often stunning gray scale and superior attention to fine details. There is only the slightest amount of edge enhancement for a picture that is very smooth. The audio has been remixed and remastered to stereo for all three films. Part II seems to suffer from slightly lower contrast levels overall, but the same review for Part I applies. The most outstanding example of digital mastering comes in Part III - a marvelously vibrant array of clips remastered (as they were for the theatrical engagement) in high def that positively glows off the screen. The audio is 5.1 surround and is remarkably aggressive throughout. <br /> <br />Extras include a bonus disc of musical outtakes and extras, audio only catalogue of songs and dances, the original footage of the LA premiere with all of the old time musical stars in attendance and a series of short subjects that collectivelyperform like a documentary on the series. There are also the original theatrical trailers for each film to be had. In the immortal words of George Gershwin...\\"who could ask for anything more?\\"  <br />
B00005JNEI|5.0|Brilliant movie-makes you think and ask questions-I am still  the same person and have my own thoughts-Noone should be so worried and threatened that a movie can influence people.This is just the way Moore feels and thinks and shows why he does.It was entertaining,funny,sad,and had a good point.
B00005JLEU|5.0|If you are into Hayao Miyazaki, this DVD is a must.  The colors are brilliant, the animation is extremely imaginative and stands out from the rest.  Another great DVD that you might enjoy is Gartel's- Trance, Dance and Other Living things.  Gartel is the Miyazaki of Multi Media.  You might also enjoy the Ren and Stimpy series.  I can't help myself, I just like them.

B00005JNEI|3.0|People complain about Michael Moore's liberal hold of the truth, but then speak of other anti-Moore sites and books as the truth.  Fascinating, really.   <br /> <br />The truth, as usually the case, lies more toward the middle.  Moore doesn't necessarily lie, but he does take liberties with the truth and mislead, but honestly, he SHOULD!  When you're making propaganda, the last thing you want to do is get bogged down my details.  You lose the emotional effect of your audience when you do that. Ask Karl Rove and George W. Bush on that. <br /> <br />Watch the movie and then independantly search the truth and forget all about michaelmoore.com and ihatemichaelmoore.com (persumably, there is one).  You shouldn't blindly accept this movie as truth, but watch it as part of the process of questioning our President which we all need to do.
B00005JMAH|1.0|This was the most disappointing movie I have ever seen considering the wait for it. I think the makeup department on this one relied on soot and mud. The plot , what little was actually in the movie was an afterthought. Very disjointed and boring. I couldn't wait to leave the theater. My sons thought it was awful. I hope the next director goes back to the old format and makes it a magical experience that all J.K. Rowling books present. Some say the themes was darker, I say all it was was dingy in this movie. The casting of Michael Gambeon was terrible, he reminded me of someones Daft uncle and not the character of Albus Dumbledore. No strength or genuine warmth at all, in fact the most likable character, and the cleanest was, Snape and he's supposed to be the heavy! Unless the next one is better this franchise is on its way out. Save your money on this one and send the message not to mess with the Harry Potter stories.
B00011RPB0|1.0|Yeah, if one does not like this movie, he/she is classified as \\"shallow\\". But I say that \\"shallow\\" is everything this useless piece of rubbish is, a movie so devoid of humor, a great swindle. <br /> <br />This movie portrays Japan in an absurd way. The jokes are simply not funny. The \\"serious\\" issues are also not touched in a proper wasy. I simply could care less about Johansson's or Murray's characters. They are bored. They have some money, they are travelling to a foreign country full of history and culture for the first time, and all they can do is complain and complain and complain some more. The movie won Best Original Screenplay. Uau! How can it be? <br /> <br />Maybe the name \\"Coppola\\" has a lot do do with it. Probably, after testifying that his daughter's talents as director rivalled those of her talents as actress(be it: none), good old Francis pulled some chords, so Sofia could get away with this garbage,] <br /> <br />I hated this movie with all my heart (and that is very bad feeling, I know. I don't hate it anymore since I don't watch it anymore). But I hated not because it is simply bad, but because it's a fake product, a bad product, a movie that lives in a vacuum, advertised as a masterpiece and gaining such praise, when better \\"cheap\\" productions gained nothing. I'm a big fan of the so-called \\"Intelligent movies\\", movies that challenge Hollywood estabilished pattern of stupid action, CGI stupid effects, plot holes wider than a football stadium. But to see a pile of crap like this gets so much praise really annoys me. <br /> <br />Enjoy this \\"masterpiece\\" at your own risk, so you can say to people that didn't like phrases like: \\"You did not understand it\\"; \\"You're too shallow to get it\\", and so on and so on...

I have followed her principles for 2.5 years now, and I can honestly say that my life is 100% better for doing so.

B00005JLXE|3.0|You can tell this movie was written and directed by a fan. There is no doubt in my mind that Mark Steven Johnson is a DareDevil fan and I know he meant well. However, just because you're a fan doesn't mean the movie you make will be any good. Though he does stay very true to the dark Frank Miller version of DareDevil, which is a good thing because, in my opinion, the Stan Lee and Bill Everett version had zero appeal. Since DareDevil is a lesser-known character it would have been more appealing to do a comic book movie that wasn't your typical comic book movie. However they just chose to take bits and pieces of other comic book movies and put them together. Don't get me wrong, the stuff they took from other films is interesting but we've seen it all before in other comic book movies. For example the look of the movie looks very much like Alex Proyas's version of James O Barr's The Crow. But to me DareDevil should look and feel more like something a long the lines of Taxi Driver. A DareDevil movie shouldn't be like Batman, or Spider-man or any other comic book superhero movie. It should be like The Godfather, or Good Fellas, or Taxi Driver, with a Superhero thrown in the middle of it all. However, looking pass the facts that this is a typical comic book movie it has its good and bad points. Most of the acting in it is pretty good. I liked Ben Afflecks performance a lot, despite what others say. I also highly admire the fact that he took a pretty big pay cut to do the film because he's actually a fan. Colin Farrell plays his part well and you can tell he had fun with it but you're left wishing he had more lines and a bigger part. Michael Clark Duncan isn't my ideal Kingpin, but not because he's black but because he's not that scary. Michael Clark Duncan seems more like a big puppy dog than he does a villain. Another thing is Kingpin should never smile, Michael Clark Duncan smiles way too much in the movie but that's also partly the fault of Mark Steven Johnson. Jennifer Garner plays her part pretty well but not with much flavor. She's very sweet in the movie but Elektra should have more appeal than just sweet. What made her character in the comics so appealing to DareDevil was that she was an equal. Not just some pretty girl with a nice smile. They do play up the fact that she is DareDevil's equal but they do it in such a corny and stupid way. There's a seen in the park where Matt and Elektra start to fight but it makes pretty much no sense. Matt is trying to get her name and all of a sudden they start doing all these flips and kicks. If Matt is trying to hide the fact that he has powers, he isn't doing a very good job of it. That part aside, Ben and Jennifer actually have pretty good chemistry on screen but what's more amazing is the chemistry between Ben Affleck and Jon Favreau. Mark Steven Johnson really rights some great dialogue between the two. I would actually love to see Johnson write a buddy movie staring Ben and Jon. Another thing I liked about the movie is all the little \\"inside\\" stuff only comic book fans will get. Like when Jack Murdock (Matt's father) is approached by Fallon and he mentions three other fighters names \\"Miller, Mack, Bendis\\" are all the last names of more or less recent writers of DareDevil. And some obvious stuff like Kevin Smith's appearance because Smith wrote the comic back in 98. And I thought it was really cool that they had the fight between Elektra and Bullseye from DareDevil 181 that is legendary. Overall I wouldn't say this is a bad movie just they could have made it so much more interesting. They could have made it more like an actual movie and less like a comic book movie. Though I must say that the second disk is worth the price of the DVD alone. There is a REALLY good documentary on DareDevil with interviews with some of the greatest DareDevil creators out there.
B0002OERI0|5.0|The five star reviews say it all. This album is more than what I expected. I still couldn't believe this is the same Green Day of my 'Dookie' days in high school. The rhythm remains fundamentally Green Day but the lyrics and overall music composition have definitely 'evolved'. They're more mature in this album but they're basically the same. I love all the songs but I particularly appreciate 'Jesus of Suburbia'. The changes in rhythm and sound in this 'mini-opera' is so seamless it's like listening to a rock version of 'Take Five' by the Dave Brubeck Quartet. The song 'Holiday' is also a favorite because I thought that it closely resembled the 'Dookie' Green Day. Plus, it was so anti-Bush :D
B00005JMAH|5.0|A lot of people are less than enthusiastic about Alfonso Cuaron's take on The Prisoner of Azkaban, and I must admit that I too was a little displeased at first. There are some interesting--some would say unnecessary--changes to the geography of Hogwarts (a new location for Hagrid's cabin, and the addition of the clock tower in the front of the school, for instance), as well a whole new directorial style that perhaps threw some people off.    But it seems to be the creative license taken with the plot that has caused the most discomfort for die hard fans of this imaginative and playful series. This movie is easily the least faithful to the letter of the book so far, and many fans can't seem to get past that.    I say it is least faithful to the letter, but in spirit it is right on target. This is the story where Harry begins to really delve into his past, learning more than he ever knew about his parents. This is facilitated by the appearance of Professor Lupin, an old school chum of Harry's father, and the escape of Sirius Black from Azkaban, whose relationship to Harry I shall not divulge for those few who have been in a coma for the last several years.    In essence, this is a coming of age story, and Cuaron really hits the nail on the head in this respect. His treatment of Harry's reaction to learning the connection between himself and Black is brilliantly played (I love the shots filmed from under the invisibility cloak in the Three Broomsticks), and Harry's relationship with Lupin was also spot on. And let's not forget the clever asides displaying Ron & Hermione's budding romance (surely you can see that one coming?!).    The casting, as usual, seemed to have tapped into the collective imagination of the fans. Who better to play Professor Trelawney than Emma Thompson?! Pam Ferris actually WAS Aunt Marge, and Gary Oldman played the dissheveled, slightly mad Black to a \\"T\\". It's like they were plucked straight from my mind and placed on the screen.    To top it all off, the entire atmosphere of the series has taken a turn for the better with this movie. As much as I love the first two films (and I love them dearly), they now seem a little rigid in comparison. Cuaron really captured the playfulness of Rowling's books. Whether it was the Whomping Willow batting a twittering bird out of the sky to signify the end of the carefree summer, or Hermione wondering aloud about how her hair looks from the back, this film at times seemed to be winking at the audience.    This also came across in the musical score, once again brilliantly composed by John Williams. From \\"Aunt Marge's Waltz\\" to \\"The Knight Bus,\\" Williams deftly captured the mood of Cuaron's film, and it seemed to me that he opened things up a little and had a bit more fun this time around. I cannot recommend the soundtrack enough for those who listen to this brand of modern-day classical music.    There's only one real problem with this DVD (not the movie itself), and it's the same problem I had with the previous two: where is the director's commentary?!!! I'm dying to get the inside scoop on these films, but so far have been denied in this respect. Hopefully we'll eventually get some Special Director's Cut 6 1/2 Year Anniversary Edition or whatnot, although I'd rather they rewarded their loyal fans by including the commentaries in the initial releases.    So to all those who were disappointed with this take on Harry Potter, watch it again and see what you think upon further review. It took me a couple of viewings to really appreciate what Cuaron has done with this film, so don't give up on it before really giving it a go. It is, as Ron would say, \\"bloody brilliant!\\"

There's a section where after a thick wall of guitar distortion, John Squire then kicks-in with very fast funky riffing. Once I heard this, it was a sheer epiphany, not only is 'I Am The Resurrection one of the greatest songs I ever heard, but it then led me to the rest of the songs where I realized that this is one of the most brilliant albums I've ever had graced my ears. Ian Brown, John Squire, Mani, and Reni. You will never get another band where each member excelled at each of their musical gifts/instruments. Resurrection. Revelation. Powerful. Pure Bliss. The ending of 'I Am The Resurrection' crescendos floating skyward, and how fitting is that...an album that soars far above the rest, a band who's legacy will be remembered, but disappearing into the sunset.

B0000CABBW|5.0|It's always a pleasure to recommend a good film and Whale Rider is  more than just good, you will be moved to laugh and weep, to grieve and exult, and it will stay in your heart forever. It will certainly stay in mine.<br /><br />When his canoe capsized a thousand years ago, Paikea escaped death by riding to shore on the back of a whale. On the east coast of New Zealand, the Whangara people honour this great ancestor and the Whangara chiefs are accepted as Paikea's direct descendants.<br /><br />Pai believes she is destined to be the new chief but her grandfather Koro knows he must choose a male heir. Although a thousand years of tradition and a deep love for her grandfather battle in the 11 year old Pai, she must fight to fulfill her destiny.<br /><br />The mythic whale rider, ancient symbol of Maori spirituality and connection to Nature, also brings that destiny and Pai's spirit is drawn throughout the film to these great creatures. There is a magnificent scene with beached whales where Pai greets one in Maori fashion, passing breath through her nose to symbolise the passing of her spirit in the breath of life. The extraordinary Keisha Castle-Hughes as Pai truly does breathe life into every scene with a commanding vitality and astonishing power. The story is elegantly told with Maori music and rituals bridging the spoken dialogue (mostly in English, some in Maori with subtitles).<br /><br />This is a story of family relationships, of torn loyalties, of generational conflict, of love and rejection, of hope and a lesson in acceptance. It's also a gripping mystical fable and simply one of the most beautiful films I have seen in my entire life
B00005ATQF|4.0|There is no doubt that Kubrick is one of the greatest directors in history.  He made thirteen films, some of them huge critical successes, few had commercial success, most were loved by some and disliked by others, but, arguably, all of them had some great attribute.  That is where I would categorize \\"Full Metal Jacket\\".  Like most Kubrick films it is slow in pace, centers around few characters, pragmatic in tone, and presents Kubrick's misanthropic view. <br /> <br />    The film is sliced in half:  the first part taking place in Marine boot camp on Parris Island and the second in combat zones in Vietnam.  The film has a strange feel and doesn't make a good transition from the first segment to the second.  Pvt. Joker (Matthew Modine) is the major charactor in the film but has only a supporting role in the boot camp segment.   <br /> <br />    Drill Instructor Hartman (played by R. Lee Ermey) is terrific as a hard-ass drill instructor complete with colorful profanity, driving his recruits to the limit.  While some of the focus is on Pvt. Joker, as well as the rest of the recruits, the focal point is on D.I. Hartman verbally pummelling Gomer Pyle (Vincent D'Onofrio), an overweight recruit who just can't hack it.  I would imagine that this is the most realistic portrayl of boot camp ever.  Just watching the first half of this movie is often enough to get my fill of Vietnam. <br /> <br />    The second half is much different from the first.  The man are no longer recruits, they are soldiers.  They have learned what they need to make it to combat and now they must merely survive.  As I said before, this part of the film is about Pvt. Joker, who is used by Kubrick to make a statement about war.  Joker tries to make sense of what is going on and what he can take from it.  He takes a cynical sometimes even sardonic view of life at war.  One of the more poignant moments in the film occurs when a Colonel questions Joker about having \\"Born to Kill\\" on his helmet and a peace sign on his vest.  His initial response is \\"I don't know sir.\\"  Then it changes to \\"I think I was trying to say something about the duality of man.\\"  And thats really Kubrick's motivation for making this film. <br /> <br />    Fans of Kubrick will want to see this film and will find some enjoyment in watching it.  They will not, however, find it to be as good as his earlier works.  Nor is this another \\"Platoon\\"; it is not a political film.  It is a film that wants to give a realistic picture of what it was to be a young man entering the military at a time of war, and what kind of man you were in war.
B000060P79|1.0|As you probably know, Pierre and Chuck along with 2 talented musicians founded the great Quebecer punk band Reset. Great lyrics, original guitar work (really original...not a lot of punk guitarists use tapping in their solos, plugged on a Boss Metal Zone disto pedal) and innovative melodies. Go check for everything you can find on Reset, you won't regret it.    But then...ouch, still hurts me...the ashes from Reset resulted in a one-man studio trip album called Radioactive (which is sooooo bad...Phil should have put this cd under his name, without raping the name of Reset) and this...yuk...Simple Plan band. Empty of intelligent lyrics, empty of originality...but full of superficiality...still empty of sense. Especially Pierre...dude, come on!!! You once wrote awesome lyrics about those fat industries that keep on destroying our mother Earth...pretty sad to see it all turned out to be songs about broken hearts, wanting to be perfect to you daddy's eyes...boohoo...WAKE UP!!!

B00005JNEI|5.0|If there was one film this year that was more maligned than \\"The Passion of the Christ\\", it is \\"Fahrenheit 9/11\\". You either love Michael Moore's work or you don't. I think it is safe enough to say that \\"Fahrenheit 9/11\\" polarized both the liberals and conservatives. If anything learned from the controversy over \\"Fahrenheit 9/11\\" and \\"The Passion of the Christ\\", there are three conversation topics that makes people's blood boil it has to be: 1) abortion, 2) religion, and 3) politics. Michael Moore's political film really succeeded in pissing off a lot of people. I first saw \\"Fahrenheit 9/11\\" when it first opened in the summer. I loved it. I thought it was far more entertaining than \\"Bowling For Columbine\\" (although I do love that film). I think it is funny that people think this film is propaganda. Maybe it is but I honestly don't care, I found the film both hilarious and engaging. I had my opinions on the current political climate long before \\"Fahrenheit 9/11\\". This movie didn't change anything for me. My biggest gripe about \\"Fahrenheit 9/11\\" is that Michael Moore makes too many innuendos (not that they weren't hilarious which they were)about the current administration therefore sounded like a thirteen year old taunting another kid on the playground instead of an adult, very childish, if not immature at times. Still I couldn't help but laugh at his innuendos. When the film shifted into a more serious tone with the war in Iraq and Lila Lipscomb, I thought that is the film's strength. Michael let the soldiers and Lila tell their side of the story. Watching \\"Fahrenheit 9/11\\" reminded me how powerful this film was, especially when the film opened up with just the sounds of people running away from the World Trade Towers on 9/11. My favorite moment in the film has to be when Michael Moore borrows an ice cream truck and drives around Capital Hill reading out loud the Patriot Act because the senators and congressmen (allegedly) never bothered reading the Patriot Act. That really floored me. I also thought it was rather prophetic of Michael to try to enlist the children of various politicians who have all voted for the war in Iraq. The dvd bonus features were just as compelling. I especially was interested in what the Arab-American comedians had to say, particularly after the terrorist attacks on 9/11. I also enjoyed watching the footage where the producer and camera crew went to before and (allegedly) after the war in Iraq. Overall I loved \\"Fahrenheit 9/11\\" and I refuse to apologize for the fact that I love this film. Did it really change my opinions on the current political climate? No but I was thoroughly entertained.really floored me. I also thought it was rather prophetic of Michael to try to enlist the children of various politicians who have all voted for the war in Iraq.

B0001NBMBC|5.0|Slipknot has created a masterpiece with their third CD.  I very rarely take the time to come on here and review anything, but after listening to this for two days straight and being amazed at its complexity, I had to pass the word on. <br /> <br />This album maintains Slipknot's heavy and fast style but with better musicianship.  More complex themes and riffs can be found throughout.  There are a few slower acoustic songs, but they have a dark feel to them that makes them fit in with the rest of the music. <br /> <br />If you only like hard, fast noise then you may not like this CD.  If you are into good heavy music by real musicians, this is the CD for you.
B000002C2E|5.0|I didn't care for Love & Theft at all, but Time Out Of Mind I thought was great. I have never really been a true fan of this guy's music (with a few <br />exceptions, etc.) until I heard this album...and then I went and got hold of some of his other stuff. <br /> <br />The Essential Bob Dylan is another CD I would highly recommend.
B00003CXCT|5.0|Honestly some of the best movies ever made. Okay, there are some minor changes to make things cleaner and more accurate, not too much to make you feel uncomfortable. If you are a Star Wars fan it's is basically a must to own the trilogy on DVD, VHS does not do it justice. Buy this item.
B000002KCF|5.0|Why this music never really took off is beyond me.  Sure I HATED it the first time I played it.  The copy I had borrowed was ancient...  A CD that probably cost over $30 when originally purchased, that had the smooth top and bottom as opposed to the ridged one, the CD, all metal, and no barcode whatsoever, made the packaging look completely different than that of now.  It was sort of bewildering, seeing as at the time I was only 14.  A year passed, and a friend of mine's father had passed away.  He burned virtually every CD he had ever owned, which was most likely thousands.  I took  most if not all of his copied inventory...idiot me, there had to be hundreds more that i could have savored.  But in the fold,I got Pink Floyd's Dark Side of the Moon, Led Zeppelin I, Sting's Ten Summoner's Tales, and by mistake, Michael Franks' Art of Tea.  I remembered the old musty CD I had borrowed, which had fascinated, and bewildered me.  I reluctantly slid it into the DVD player.  It came to life, and I didn't get the same feeling. The feeling was something of a wash, in warm chords and vocals.  Not to mention Claus Ogerman strings.  Was I ever impressed.  The song?? Nightmoves. It had the sound of a late night jazz club, filled with smoke and mirrors.  It made me sit at attention, hungry for more.  It faded, and I felt the urge to repeat it, only to let it run, into the humorous and sexy Eggplant.  I just kept on listening, and more and more i was affected.  The one that stood out from the crowd, was \\"St. Elmo's Fire\\"  I loved the title and the beautiful time changes, and string arrangements.  The song is of a young couple thinking of getting together, amid a box of weed, and a rocky past relationship.  I loved hearing it and knew the feeling, a few years later.  This CD served as a piece in the soundtrack to my growing up.  This soundtrack is peppered with all types of music.  The fun part of this soundtrack is that now at 18, I find myself coming back more and more and just being floored by what touched me so deeply in my teenaged years.  To find Mr. Franks, in there not once but 3 or 4 times, is a very reassuring thing, seeing as his music struck a chord by being quirky and different.  His vocals, wry and playful.  His piano and guitar, sweeping and simple.  The music is still so great and makes me look to the future as a bright and interesting thing.  Thanks to the Art of Tea, i know the legend that is Michael Franks
B0002TSZK6|5.0|It is like it is, we all have our own opinions on the view points and I may not be a big political buff I do have my own view points. I'm voting for John Kerry when the time comes because from the first time I saw George W. all those years ago I didnt like him. Michael Moore shows us lies, he shows us truths and he shows us a thought provoking subject. Suffice to say that Fahrenheit 9/11 is seriously controversial and seriously should be viewed wheter your for Bush or not. Moore tackles subjects like commerical adds for big cooperate places, footage from many different things, like the war in Iraq, or the bombings in Baghdad to Bush putting around the golf ball. He tackles issues in his home town of Flint, Michigan. A lot of people may hate this movie but I thought of it to be a button pusher and a sure fire winner. Some footage might be too shocking to watch. The Bonanza rip off called Afghanastan was hilarious with Bush and Cheney's heads pasted on cowboys riding horses. one of 2004's best
B0002TT0NW|5.0|I know a lot of reviewers were disappointed by this movie with the new director and all but I did not find this movie disappointing at all. This is the movie that actually got me hooked into the whole Harry Potter series. I saw the first and second movie and thought this was gear towards a younger audience. I never really even took the interest in reading the books. However, after watching Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, I was very interested to find out what happens next. After the movie, I went ahead and ordered all the Harry Potter books and movies that are currently out. This movie is a lot darker then the others but I enjoyed it the most.
B003BYX9SW|5.0|Note:  I saw this film via XFinity On Demand.<br /><br />In my original review of Troy 9 years ago, I praised the theatrical cut of the movie, saying that it was better than The Iliad by Homer, and that the liberties taken enhanced the film. A few years later, I read that a Director's Cut of the movie had been released, and I checked out the reviews on it, to see if it was even worth it.<br /><br />Is the Director's Cut worth it? YES, YES, YES and YES!!!!<br /><br />I saw the Director's Cut of the movie a few hours ago, and I have to say that it's much better than the theatrical cut of the film. More story has been added, giving the film much needed drama which was lacking in the original release print, along with more violence, two extended scenes with female nudity and an extended sex scene. MILD SPOILERS!!! The additional material includes an extended scene where Priam (played by the excellent Peter O'Toole) tells Hector (Eric Bana) why he has decided to let the Greeks beseige Troy, along with a scene where Hector suspects that Paris (Orlando Bloom) is sleeping with the fisherman's wife and a brief scene extension of the party, giving Helen (Diane Kruger) the motivation for falling in love with Paris. SPOILERS OVER!!! It sucks, however, that Warner Bros. wouldn't let Mr. Petersen use Gabriel Yared's infinitely superior score, which they had the stupidity to reject in favour of a repetitive, but somewhat interesting, score from Mr. Horner. At least, they let him use the track Sparta for the scene where Menelaus is toasting to peace. I think it's more accurate to the period than Horner's score for that scene. Using cues from The Count Of Monte Cristo and Planet Of The Apes was also a good choice. And finally, the song performed by Josh Groban over the end credits of the theatrical cut is gone, and replaced with proper music score. The song Remember Me is fine as a stand-alone song, but it was just wrong for TROY. I wonder what the Director's Cut would have been like, had Warner Bros. allowed Mr. Petersen to use Mr. Yared's more appropriate and lushful score, instead of Mr. Horner's score. Thankfully, the music by Mr. Horner has been re-edited for the Director's Cut, and thus gives the film a natural musical progression. (Technical note: The lip-synching looked to be a little off in the scene where Hector and Paris are arguing about Helen on board their ship).<br /><br />Not Rated, but contains graphic violence & sexuality/nudity.e, had Warner Bros. allowed Mr. Petersen to use Mr. Yared's more appropriate and lushful score, instead of Mr. Horner's score.

B00005JNEI|1.0|Michael Moore is by no means an idiot. It takes a mastermind to manipulate facts the way he does. Anyone that takes the things he says to heart honestly does not know a thing about what he is saying. One interesting fact about Michael Moore is that he had a private screening of Bowling For Columbine for victims and the family members of victims. When they arrived they were expected to pay for entry to the movie that he invited them to. Michael Moore spreads his anti american sentiment all around the world and ignorant people soak it up. Michael Moore is quoted as having said that the people on the planes during 9/11 were scaredy cats and that if there had been black people on the planes they would have fought back and crushed them because they don't take disrespect from anyone. That is how warped this guys mind is. I STRONGLY SUGGEST THAT ANYONE THAT WATCHES HIS MOVIES READ \\"Micheal Moore is a big fat stupid white man.\\" This book provides facts and gives the sources so that you can see yourself that Michael Moore is a liar. This man is everything he hates.
B00005JNEI|5.0|I continue to be amazed at folks that condemn this movie without having seen it.  I would implore everyone, regardless of where you sit, to at least watch it before you dare to trash it.  Anyone who has seen Michael's documentaries knows that he takes some editorial liberties.  However, watch only Bush's face as he sits in the elementary classroom, the minutes slowly ticking, after he is told that \\"America is under attack\\" by his aide.  Then, watch the protesters at the inaugural parade.  Then, ask yourself, \\"why didn't we see or read about any of this via our national media?\\"  If nothing else, Moore gives us information that we, as free Americans, should have been given by our free press.  Would that be the case, we wouldn't need the Michael Moores of this nation.
B000069KE0|4.0|I was but a strapping young lad in the fall of 1970 when I got hooked on Chicago. If \\"Chicago II\\" wasn't my first album, it was certainly the second. Chicago II brings with it an enormous store of memories: of blowing my horn along with the records -- me on trombone and my kid brother on trumpet; of blasting away at \\"25 or 6 to 4\\" in high school band; of desperately hoping to be in a rock band and star of the show. Aside from the memories, the neat thing about the CD, of course, is that the scratches and skips that were inevitable on the album are magnificently erased -- though I can tell you where each one was.<br /><br />Chicago II is a work of sublime artistry, though occasionally in the service of silly songs (don't get me started on \\"Fancy Colors\\"!). But much of the album is more substantial. \\"Ballet for a Girl From Buchanan\\" -- the seven-piece \\"Make Me Smile\\" suite -- is best heard as a unit, not as the madly butchered version heard on the radio. The orchestral suite that ends with \\"Memories of Love\\" \\" may or may not compare with the classical masters, but is still a sad and lovely elegy to a lost love. Even the album's overplayed pop standards (\\"Make Me Smile\\", \\"25 or 6 to 4\\", \\"Colour My World\\") are rendered tolerable in long version, their sometimes-sickly sweetness diluted by their musical neighbors.<br /><br />Chicago II includes moments of true genius. Focus on individual instruments to hear how extraordinary was this ensemble -- Terry Kath's ravishingly ornate guitar work and soulful lead voice; Peter Cetera's purposefully meandering bass lines; Danny Seraphine's divinely melodic drumming; Jimmy Pankow's bright and wonderful brass arrangements. To hear this individual artistry in combination with others is like a foretaste of heaven.<br /><br />By the release of Chicago II, the band was well on its way toward pop stardom. The political edge of the first album, Chicago Transit Authority, was replaced almost completely by more empty-headed works -- love ballads and odes to living in the country. In spite of the darkness of the times, the band managed oddly to purvey a spirit of optimism and blissful nonchalance. For whatever reason, Chicago chose the \\"lite\\" path of popular culture, leaving the somber soul of the times for others to mine. Only the liner notes reflect a bit their previous politics.<br /><br />Still, Chicago's moments of musical perfection were captured for all time on vinyl and now plastic, lifting the band out of the dreary depths of mere poppishness: Terry's soaring guitar solo on \\"25 or 6 to 4,\\" the confident brass solo on \\"Make Me Smile,\\" the iconic flute solo on \\"Colour My World.\\" It has been nearly 35 years, and still, this is a work of art that I never tire of listening to.ove ballads and odes to living in the country.

B00005JNEI|5.0|Powerful and full of facts, this is a movie that every american should take the time out and see, no matter what side you're on.  It makes you want to ask those higher up in our political system some big questions.  Thanks to Michael Moore for such a brillant film.
B00005221M|5.0|This is one of the few movies I consider worth owning, because it's one of the few that I can watch time and time again. It is a spectacular movie. The action scenes are superb. The music is incredible. The story is top-notch. The scenery in this movie is really breathtaking, and is brought to its zenith in the last major scene of the movie. Combined with the best track from the soundtrack the last 20 minutes of the movie are truly memorable. <br /> <br />If you don't like this movie, you do not like movies. Rottentomatoes gives is a 96, which is an almost unheard of rating. The single dissension was written by a clown (go ahead and read it - it's about 150 words of tripe by a lazy idiot). <br /> <br />This movie has left me wanting to take the several hour drive to north carolina to visit the park where the final scene takes place.
B0002IQNAG|5.0|I love this Set.  For Everyone that has recently seen Shaun of the Dead this is a must buy.  The extras and commentary are outstanding and watching three different interpretations of a the same movie is great.  Its amazing how the editing process can change the entire tone of a director's vision.  I reccommend this set as the be-all Dawn of The Dead collection.
B00004U2GH|5.0|If you are a fan of Johnny Cash you probably have this cd.  If you are looking to buy a Johnny Cash album you SHOULD have this cd.  Considering this was recorded in 1969 (in a prison no less) the recording is extraordinary.  Many of the classics are on here, Big River, A Boy Named Sue, and Folsom Prison Blues to name a few.  Johnny Cash is too sincere not to be appreciated.  You can tell he really relates to the prisoners and the state they are in.  This cd is indeed a landmark in the world of music.
B00006RU5B|4.0|I found myself doing something the other day that I have not done in ages: Head-banging in my car. Audioslave simply rocks. After years of enduring an endless cacophony of angry rap/metal bands that try to screw the world with 4 chords, Audioslave throws us a musical bone that we can sink our teeth into. The clean, driving riffs of front man-less Rage Against the Machine are a great match for Chris Cornell's aftermarket pipes. Tom Morello's virtuosity produces some of the coolest guitar effects this side of Radiohead. Cornell is still firmly at the controls of one of rockdom's most explosive voice boxes and Soundgarden fans will also immediately recognize his tune craft and intriguing lyrical landscapes. Critics seem to fall into two groups. One bunch, hoping for more RATM, laments the tepid political offering of the band. The fact is that most people listened to Machine IN SPITE of Zach de la Rocha's spittle-laden sermons. The other group cries, \\"Grunge!\\" and turns up its nose. These are the same people who liked the Cure \\"before they became popular\\". For them, greatness lies in obscurity and novelty. Get a life! Music does not always have to say something or make a statement about the listener. In the case of Audioslave, the music speaks for itself.  Will this album change your life or define a generation? No, but it will put a tune in your head and a grin on your face that won't soon be erased. Pop it in, roll down the windows, and test the limits of your car's stock stereo system. This is pure, high-octane rock at its best. Enjoy.
B00009V7T2|5.0|Alright to all you At the Drive-in fans who haven't bought this I implore you, get it now.  At the Drive-in can never be imitated or replicated, but the Mars Volta has a very similar flavor and will surely be enjoyed by old ATDI fans.  For those of you who are looking to buy Deloused in the Crematorium without even knowing who At the Drive-in is, I would suggest buying Relationship of Command.  Or just buy both Relationship of Command and Deloused in the Crematorium.  Both are some of the best space/punk/post-hxc/jazz-fusion/salsa albums you will ever hear.  Guitar wise Omar is amazing.  He combines such interesting solos with his driving riffs.  The keyboard player also adds alot.  Musically this is an amazing album.  Buy now.
B000148KK2|4.0|Many of Diana Krall's existing fans who like and want to keep her singing and playing standards will not like this CD.  Other fans, like myself, who enjoy seeing artists break new ground and show different facets of themselves as artists will welcome this CD with open arms.  I knew from my first listen of \\"Stop This World\\" that this was going to be a very special CD, and I was not disappointed.  Other favorites include the title track, \\"Love Me Like A Man,\\" \\"Temptation,\\" \\"I've Changed My Address,\\" \\"Black Crow,\\" and \\"Departure Bay.\\"  I'm not that crazy about Ms. Krall's take on her husband's \\"Almost Blue,\\" but maybe if I was more familar with Elvis Costello, I would have more appreciation of it.  I think the CD is very strong overall, and if approached from the standpoint of hearing something new and different, rather than \\"more of the same\\" from Ms. Krall, you just may find that you like it, too.
B000002BYD|5.0|Yield is my probably my favorite Pearl Jam album.  The intial rocker, Whose Got the Brain of JFK, is just an excellent start to a very fulfilling ablum.  Pearl Jam seems to have tapped into a slight Indy feel with this album, and they seem very comfortable doing it.  If you are expecting the same sounds as Ten this probably isn't what you are looking for.  Pearl Jam didn't have quite as much to prove on this album, it is more relaxed.  Enjoy it.
B00007GZVV|5.0|Years ago I met the producers of this film when it was just a dream in their imaginations.  They are to be congratulated for pulling it off!  It took me far too long to see the film, and I truly enjoyed it.  Yes, the visual effects really are amazing! The film was moving, and I look forward to watching it again and checking out the DVD so many have mentioned.  The extremes in ratings were entertaining to read.  It was interesting to read the references to CS Lewis, Monteverdi's Orfeo, and William Blake's Marriage of Heaven and Hell.  What nobody has mentioned is that the heaven and hell scenes are based on Emmanuel Swedenborg's visions in his book, Heaven and Hell.  A Swedish genius in the 1700's, Swedenborg is a mystic and understands the dynamics of living systems, having first been a mechanical engineering genius, before developing his unusual and fascinating theology.  Blake was one of the signers of the charter for the first Swedenborg Church in London, by the way, and Swedenborg influenced Wordsworth, Yeats, John Muir, Emerson, Thoreau, Helen Keller, Mary Baker Eddy, Carl Jung, and others. Another favorite film, about spirituality and romance, otherwise entirely different, is Wim Wenders' Wings of Desire.
B00008L3U1|1.0|If I ever meet Robin Williams, I'm going to kick him right in the groin.
078681859X|5.0|This is utterly fantastic. It's placed in a modern-day parallel universe England, where magicians rule--aided, unbeknownst to most, by various spirits. The dry humor is a bonus to an excellent tale that pulls several aspects of folklore and magical tradition together into one superb story. Don't mistake this for a \\"children's book\\"; the richness and depth of the story is ideal for anyone who likes a good fantasy story.
B00005JNEI|1.0|Not meaning to copy anyone's review, but this person couldn't have said it any better.  I agree with him 110%.   <br /> <br />A documentary can have a point of view, it cannot present 59 lies as the truth, By definition this is not a documentary but it is propaganda; and its a shame people will see this and think its the gospel truth. There is plenty to criticism the Bush Administration on, but believing in these \\"black helicopter\\" conspiracy theories, just puts one out on the fridge. Lets just take one example. We invaded Afghanistan so we can build a pipeline. Well, we have been in there three years now and NO PIPELINE is being built. The truth is two company's back in the mid 90s considered building a pipeline in Afghanistan, the Clinton administration even helped one of the company's bu talking with the Taliban about it. But it never came off. if was considered unfeasible and not worth it. So its a lie by Mr. Moore. I can document all 59 lies, but suffice it to say, if a witness is wrong on one materiel fact, they you must or may distrust all his \\"facts.\\" I do not begrudge anyone from seeing this film, but also seek out alternatives such as Fahrenhype 911 and Cellulose 41:11 Also see what John McCain has to say abort disingenuous film makers.  <br /> <br />Michael Moore, just another example of another democrat on a rampage against our man Bush.
1563899426|4.0|Like fairy tales (twisted or otherwise), modern fantasy, or fresh takes on old ideas? This is most definitely for you. Imagine a story pulled from one of Windling & Datlow's Snow White, Rose Red collections and translated into a graphic novel. The artwork is above average (especially for a new Vertigo title) and the storyline, while very self-contained, lays down relationships between characters that are sure to be played off of in future volumes.
0393035158|1.0|Blaming religion for the actions of a few ignorant radicals is like blaming a car for running over someone. The vehicle is not the problem, it's the person using it. Shifting the blame like this probably makes Mr. Harris feel better about his own lack of faith and his misunderstanding of religion. Humans naturally fear the unknown and the irrational ones, rather than trying for some level of understanding & knowledge, would do away with it. In the long run, eliminating religion to avoid acts of terror & violence would solve nothing. The crazy people would still be crazy and evil people who thrive on making others miserable would still find a way to do it. Belief in God, not just religion, can make this world a better place. If only more people tried it.
B00000JPYQ|5.0|I agree with the majority below that: 1.  The performances have more energy than the studio versions while maintaining excellent sound quality.  Natural Thing and Too Hot to Handle are perfect examples.  Most professional reviewers agree.  UFO was simply better in concert than in the studio, a la Thin Lizzy.  2.  The songs were all played by Schenker, as well-argued by the reviewer who noted Schenker's identical Rock Bottom solo at the 81 MSG show in Hamburg (it's true).  Watch/listen to an early 80's MSG concert or an earlier UFO concert ('76 London) to confirm.  3.  The group was definitely at its peak and never recaptured the majesty of the performance in subsequent shows, though the 94 reunion tour with Schenker comes close!  Even Schenker never duplicated, that I've heard, the mind-boggling Lights Out solo.  4.  The band is totally in sync - bass, drums, keyboard, etc.  The addition of Raymond's/Chapman's rhythm guitar really fleshes out the songs - esp. during the solos. <br /> <br />Bottom line - right there with Live and Dangerous as best live rock album of all time!! <br /> <br />
B00005JNEI|5.0|I was really honored to have been given a chance to see this movie on opening day, and it was great.  And after reading the 9/11 Commission report, it only confirmed most of the key facts.
B0000640VO|5.0|'Amelie' is probably the sweetest film I have ever seen. Although I usually like movies to have a bit more of an 'edge' (a film such as Jeux d'Enfants, for example, Yann Samuell 2003 - I consider that to be sort of the perverse counterpart to Amelie), I simply loved this modern fairytale. It has a nice story, beautiful images, with beautiful colours, and one of the best soundtracks I know. All this blends perfectly together to make a very romantic movie, you should definitely watch while being in love, or something. <br /> <br />
B0001ZMWQO|4.0|Franz Ferninand is probably the first of these newly \\"retro\\" bands coming out that actully sounds retro. Listening through the tracks it's easy to spot influences from various New Wave artists from Joy Division to The Cure. However, I prevented myself from giving the album five stars because I can't shake this feeling that it feels a bit like a cheap Eighties throwback. <br />  <br />I don't mind throwbacks myself, but it just seems a little artificial. Bloody good for a debut though. <br />
B00005JNEI|5.0|Whether you agree with his views or whether you dislike him completely, Michael Moore does one thing, he makes us think!  This is a DVD that will be in my collection for a long time.  He worked hard to take you on a journey and uses actual stories and actual news footage to make you think about current world affairs. <br /> <br />BRAVO!
B00006LI4S|5.0|it's hard to explain why a concert on dvd keeps you watching and watching. this is such a concert! sure pink floyd fans will enjoy the show as they are pink floydians. but even if you're not a pink floyd listener, this concert will certainly entertain you a lot! the intimicy, the authenticity and delicacy of the performances are so overwhelming to me, i can't remember watching and listening a dvd so often. timeless! david gilmour is a fantastic guitar player, without doubt, but it's also this wonderful band that gives so much joy. particularly the bass player, chucho merchan, is one of my favorites on this disc. and the choir, whew!!!! <br />you won't be dissappointed! <br />

B00062IDCO|3.0|The idea was good, the Delta quadrant had potential, and the series were a pass backward of the epic DS9, but however they didn't used it for the rivalry of a better share. The result: a serie that loses in himself. Sometimes weak in its evolution where the Borg become far less dark and dangerous than the previous series, where was used a fully capable Borg as an averaged capable crewmember in some episodes (so fast for my taste), and the worst, where lacks in the previously created universe by ST:DS9(the same fault carried by \\"Enterprise\\" about the whole ST historical universe, but that they can still solve. I hope. I prey.) <br /> <br />Anyway If you never saw ST:NG or/and ST:DS9 and you don't want to do it. Then ST:Voyager can be entertaining, otherwise I can't recomend other than ST(for lovers of the old stuff), ST:NG or ST:DS9.
B0001ZMWQO|3.0|I bought Franz Ferdinand way before the whole \\"Take me out\\" phenomenon. First listen it was incredible!  I never even heard any Franz Ferdinand before so I was a little afraid, but it was one of the few CDs that I immediately loved.  As I started listening to it more I realized that the lyrics were absolutely terrible so dismissed it.  At work we started playing it again and I realized it was just fun music.  I love the sound of the guitars and the lead singers voice.        That's all it is, fun music.  Plus it makes you want to shake your booty
B000059XUO|5.0|The irony of The Crow is that part of its mystique comes from the tragic death of Brandon Lee during filming. There's no way of knowing if the movie would have been the cult hit that it is if he had gone on to make other movies. What is undisputed is that this movie has an eerie power all its own in spite of the much talked about tragedy.  <br /> <br />Brandon Lee plays Eric Draven, a young musician killed with his fiancee on Devil's Night by a band of ruthless thugs. None of the killers are brought to justice and exactly a year later, Draven returns as The Crow, an immortal being bent on claiming justice for his dead fiancee by doing away with their murderers. Donning white makeup and a black outfit held together with electrical tape, The Crow goes about destroying those who hurt his loved ones.  <br /> <br />It's hard to separate the movie from actual events during filming, but one thing is for certain, Brandon Lee was at his finest in this film. He effectively plays a heartbroken lover, merciless vigilante, and caring father figure to the young girl he and his fiancee took care of, all at once. Draven is ruthless, but very likable and sympathetic. Injected with a dry sense of humor, Draven is trying to tie up loose ends, be they of the justice type or the emotional as he tries to keep Sarah safe. Lee made a character that could have been just a plain vigilante into something you care about. This is his movie, and while it's hard to say whether he would have become a star because of it, he definately deserved to become one from the performance. The movie itself is a nightmare of urban decay and crime. Everything is dark and ominous and Draven fits right into the scenery. The movie is at its heart a love story between Draven and his fiancee. Everything he does, all the pain he goes through and puts other people through, is for her. Draven is a kind, loving man turned into a weapon of justice by death, yet it's still all for his fiancee, which he makes plain.  <br /> <br />This movie about death and love has taken on a life of its own with events, yet it possibly is the greatest tribute to Brandon Lee as an actor that he could have.
B000005HO0|5.0|yes, so it was low porduction, but its not that bad, this was truely amaizing; however, i soo wish it was on dvd. dead is the most reconized voice in REAL black metal, listening to this, almost feels like the ohlin's ghost is sitting right next to you. <br /> <br /> i would not recomend it to people who are not already big into mayhem, but if you are a true mayhem fan, this is a must. the reason that that is the sound is a little bit of a mess, but true fans....how could it not be their favorit recording by them? I also recomend that you get this other cd titled \\"de mysteriis dom sathanas\\" along with it. <br /> <br />I still can't get over how much i wish this was on dvd, but if it is...PLEASE LET ME KNOW!  <br /> <br />i think they screwed up funeral fog a lil bit, but pure f**king amagedon, wow, it sounds better than the origional. <br /> <br />let me also add that early mayhem was more of death metal than black metal,infact i say that de mysteriis dom sathanas was there first actual black metal recording. so that is why i put death/black metal at the top.  <br />infact really, the fact that this is black metal barely shows up on the cd, but this cd really kicks ass, i defently recomend it.  <br /> <br />

B0000024JN|5.0|I bought it last week, and I listened to it the first time. I wasn't too happy with my purchase, since, I only liked two songs on it, well, the more I listened to it, the more I liked it. Now I can't get enough of it! I think they did an awesome job their debut album. It is one of the best albums I have ever purchased! I am so happy that I decided to buy it. I have heard on the radio many of their hits, and all of them are amazing! I can't stop listening to it, or singing the words at school! I wish I could just convince my friends that this album is worth buying, and going to be played so much it will be worn out.
B0002VKZL6|5.0|In many important ways, music reviews are as helpful as screen doors on a submarine. People who lament Mark Knopfler for not writing a 2004 version of Money for Nothing are pining for more of what they REMEMBER about Dire Straits, a band that was so thoroughly 80's without sounding dated. The fundamental shortcoming of this view is that Dire Straits was 20% Money For Nothing or Calling Elvis and 80% of what makes up the bulk of Mark's solo work.<br /><br />I discovered Dire Straits through my older brother, just about when they stopped making music. I remember feeling how tragic this loss was, as I felt their last album, On Every Street, was an excellent follow up to Brothers in Arms. Clearly, the band did not sound like it was on the way out. Dire Straits became my favorite band and I have a deep love of every single album the band has released.<br /><br />This is why it is baffling to me when people who review Mark Knopfler's work through the lens of Dire Straits fail to remember the huge volume of work that is stylistically very similar to his new music. For example, the Brothers in Arms album, which is widely considered the most popular album by his former band, is packed with tracks that bare this out:<br /><br />So Far Away; Your Latest Trick; Why Worry; Ride Across the River; The Man's Too Strong; Brothers in Arms<br /><br />None of these songs rocked. Only 3 of the 9 tracks on this album were traditional rock tunes, only 2 of those getting radio play (with So Far Away making it on the radio despite its sleep walking mood).<br /><br />Go back to any album from Dire Straits and you will find that the majority of the material would feel right at home on a Mark Knopfler album. To name just a few examples: Once Upon A Time in the West; Love Over Gold; Portobello Belle; Six Blade Knife; Telegraph Road; On Every Street... the list goes on. In interviews with both Mark and his brother David, who has also released solo albums, the rock tunes were for radio and the storytelling and exploration into American folk music was for the love of the craft.<br /><br />Mark Knopfler is widely considered one of the top five guitar players ever to pick up the interment, but never because his fast fingers. It is because of his ability to coax his steel guitar into guiding the emotion of his music, not just merely playing the notes on the page. As for the critiques of his voice? I can think of more than a dozen artists whose voice had character at the expense of velvety smoothness. Mark's voice is no different.<br /><br />If you enjoyed all the music of Dire Straits and not just the radio hits, you will not be disappointed with Mark Knopfler's solo work, including this one. In the same spirit as James Taylor, Van Morrison and Eric Clapton, Knopfler has taken a seat amongst modern music's hall of fame elite. He has matured into an adult's musician who has a tremendous mastery of his craft; able to reach into many corners of musical style. Like watching a veteran athlete making the impossible seem effortless, Mark Knopfler's work, and Shangri-La is no exception, is an honor to experience.and the storytelling and exploration into American folk music was for the love of the craft. <br /> <br />Mark Knopfler is widely considered one of the top five guitar players ever to pick up the interment, but never because his fast fingers.

0060512806|5.0|I have not read a book this clever, mystifying and entertaining since \\"The Name of the Rose\\". Neal Stephenson is the American Umberto Eco, maybe even more knowledgeable and talented than the Italian master story teller himself. <br />Never in my life have I read a book where I didn't skip a few words or skim through a few paragraphs, until now. I immersed myself into every single word and punctuation mark of the 1000+ pages, because I did not want to miss out on any of the author's clever wordplays or ingenious plots that unfolded within the story. And what a story it is... <br />Neal Stephenson rates as my top 5 favorite writers of all time. <br />This book is absolutely incredible, and if you don't read it, then you are missing out on the very essence of life itself.
B00005JNEI|5.0|Every Democrat, every Independent, and every Republican in this country should see this film.  The depth of Michael Moore's love for this great country and his fellow average Americans is clearly evident in Fahrenheit 9/11.  Far too many of the policies being adopted by our \\"elected\\" government officials are created behind closed doors in secret - and contrary to what the majority of Americans want.  This film gives the average American access to more actual information - rather than the filtered news, empty sound-bytes and catch phrases that are repeated ad nauseum.  With so many multi-millionaires in his cabinet, is it any wonder President Bush is out of touch with the \\"common man\\"? Michael Moore does a masterful job of exposing the lies and inspiring Americans to get off their butts and exercise their privilege to vote with a better grasp of what's going on today in our country.
B00005JNEI|5.0|This film's greatest success is that it holds back and lets the viewer make thier own conclusions.  Moore himself, appears only once in front of the camera.  This in sharp contrast to his previous films where he stood front and center.  This film raises questions about arguably the most testing time since the fall of communism.   <br /> <br />The most profound moments was seeing a mother who had lost her son in Iraq and watching her struggle with the pain that no parent should ever have to go through, the death a child.  Also important was the way that Moore shows us a different and new side of this national tragedy.  He lets us hear the audio from that tragic day alone, which was the most stunning depiction that I have ever been exposed to (after being shown the video hundreds of times I realized that I had become numb to the horror). <br /> <br />Agree or disagree with Moore, this film aids the morning and the spiritual redress of this wound.  I highly recommend this film.
068987474X|5.0|This is the best thing I ever read.  Now I can move on after 3 years of wondering and beating my head against the wall wondering what was wrong with me.  Its not me, its him.  I'm buying several copies to give as gifts for the holidays.  Every woman should read this
0553382179|4.0|My house has always been clean, but I have had a problem with feeling cluttered in certain rooms and areas, as well as feeling a little behind most of the time.  This book has helped me to get a really good grip on the house cleaning with a very straight forward and literal schedule.  Furthermore, I put the schedule onto the refrigerator and my husband has started doing the chores too, somehow seeing it spelled out so literally and in easy-to-swallow segments makes a big difference in his willingness - also it helps that I am not telling or even asking him to do these things, he sees the list and just does them.  I don't usually respond well to the flowery expansive language of self-help type books, and this one is no exception - but the nitty-gritty advice has really changed my household for the better.  Most of the negative reviews of this book mock some of the ideas as too out there or unnecessary - but if you give them a try  you may find that they are preferable to the more lax approach you are currently taking.  This book has as much   pep-talk as practical advice, but you may need to find a different book if you are looking for more specific advice about how to clean things, or how to arrange items for organizational purposes. <br /> <br />Also, she recommends Clearing Your Clutter With Feng Shui (Kingston) which I also read and helped me enormously with the issue of clutter - that one I also recommend very highly.

B0002TKFR2|4.0|I admit a certain disappointment with this release. Yes, the sonics are 50 years old now, but these are Living Stereo recordings. The sound seems somewhat \\"soft.\\" I don't mean the volume, but the sound. It lacks vibrancy, edge and bloom. I compared it with Sony's SACD disc, with a Mendelssohn concerto performance by Stern and the Phildelphia from roughly the same period, and the Sony sounded a bit better. That surprised me. RCA's two-channel SACD layer add some spatial information the CD layer lacks, but there's nothing here that displays the dazzling sonic improvement say the Classic Records reissues showed over the old RCA Living Stereo CDs.  <br /> <br />

B0002ZYE1Y|5.0|I have been a Nightwish follower for a little over 1 year now. Since then I have purchased all of their albums before this one and saw them in their very first US concert tour. Nightwish is awesome plain and simple. This album is awesome plain and simple. The sound is a fresh new look at the potential of what heavy metal can and should be. Not dark and depressing but beautiful and inspirational. Thanks to Tarja's amazing vocals and the muscial ability of Tumos and the band...Nightwish has it all. The songs are great but still this is not the album to start with if you're first hearing about this group. 'Once'is pretty much an Americanized version of Nightwish using alot more hard and heavy guitar and alot more male vocals. (not that there is anything wrong with that) Still, songs like 'Ghost Love Score'and 'Creek Mary's Blood'is the old school sound that Nightwish began with and turned into classics such as 'Elvenpath', 'The Riddler' and 'Dead Boy's Poem' However the album is great and thanks to Roadrunner Nightwish now has the ability to grab a whole new bunch of mainstreem fans (I'm talking to all you Slipknot, Soulfly and Type-O-Negative fans!)Welcome to America Nightwish we are glad you're here.
B0001I561E|5.0|I was pretty impressed with the sound and picture quality of this DVD. expecially in the cave of wonder when their escaping, the picture is excellent. Special features include how the movie was made, new scenes, new songs, and a video of Nick Lachey and Jessica Simpson singing \\"a whole new world\\" and the deleted song that wasn't in the film \\"proud of your boy\\" performed by Clay Aiken (no its not in the movie itself even like they did with Lion King). The concept of the movie is Aladdin is a street commoner who steals to survive with his pet monkey Abu. He dreams of living inside the palace and all its wonder. Inside though, princess Jasmine is tired of the confines of the palace and wants to be free to explore the world. These two meet and instantly a relationship is formed. Tie in a law that only a prince can marry a princess, a controling advisor set on his own path to rule, and a genie thats the life of the party, and you have a great movie. A disney classic that should be had so don't delay and get this special edition right away.
068987474X|5.0|This is the best $20 (or less) you can spend, saving possibly years of therapy and definitely days of sitting by the phone. I think every teenage girl should read this before starting to date, and every single/unmarried woman should either buy this or get it as a gift. I bought mine and I am forcing everyone I know to read it.   A HUGE thank you to the authors for finally writing this book and making dating so much more simple and less confusing!
0385510438|5.0|This book is excellent, right from the first few pages.  It already has a plot that captures your mind, arousing your curiosity to read on, and on... <br /> <br />Quite unlike the other Grisham's work, this novel is cleverly separated into 3 different time (and hence 3 parts in this novel) which centres around Danny Padgitt, the murderer in the story.  Part 1 talks about the crime, the trail and how the jury comes about making the decision, Part 2 builds up suspense as Danny Padgitt serve his \\"life\\" sentence and covered mostly the success of the \\"Times\\" newspaper and development of the town, and finally Part 3 when Danny Padgitt was released from the prison. <br /> <br />Naturally the last part is the most exciting part where most of the mystery unfolds.  You would have make many guesses as to why the ending is so twisted, but as it goes along you probably be very surprise by the outcome.  At least I do. <br /> <br />Grisham also covered some grounds on equality and humanity.  In this book, the newspaper owner (cum editor and journalist) managed to foster a very deep friendship with a black american - something quite unusual in that time.  And something new is the discussion on journalism.  Having done a class on journalism, Grisham brought to life some of the \\"behind-the-scene\\" life of editors and reporters, juggling on what to cover and how to \\"sensationalise\\" issues - all for the motive of increasing subscription. <br /> <br />Once again, it is an excellent book that was hard to put down after tossing the first few pages!
6305841861|5.0|If you like horror films with a sense of humor, this is worth watching.  While it was a departure from the tone of the original Evil Dead, the parody works.
B00024I2Z4|5.0|This film is well known by now, so going into detail about the fine story and animation is not necessary. <br /> <br />I do have one problem with how the new Special Edition is presented.  Why on Earth did Disney opt to give us a letterboxed version with a 1.66:1 ratio, when the previous DVD was presented with a ratio of 1.85:1????  Even the new \\"Aladdin\\" comes in 1.66:1.  These are obviously NOT the original versions as shown in theaters.  The box for \\"Aladdin\\" states \\"Presented in Originally Created Aspect Ratio\\".  Does this mean the version we all saw in the theater was cropped top and bottom?  Are we now getting the complete image for the very first time? <br /> <br />Perplexed
B0002F6AYS|3.0|Gosh... what to say about \\"Children of the Corn\\"?<br /><br />First off, let me say: this is no masterpiece.  But, at the same time, it is no disasterpiece, either.  I'm a big-time Stephen King fan, and while this is the film adaptation of his work that comes in for the most lambasting, it is really nowhere near the worst King film.  (Look to either \\"Thinner\\" or to \\"Sleepwalkers\\" for that odious distinction.)<br /><br />I'm not going to say much about the movie, really.  It is what it is, and odds are that you already know whether or not you like this sort of thing.<br /><br />Instead, I'd like to focus on the features done for this special edition DVD.  First off, the picture and the sound quality are WAY better than might have been expected (or possibly even deserved).  The film has probably never looked or sounded better, even when it was first released.<br /><br />The documentary is about 35 minutes long, and relies on interviews with director Fritz Kiersch (who comes off as a knowledgeable and likeable man) and the actors who portrayed Isaac and Malachi (both of whom are funny and relazed about what they realize ain't exactly the finest thing since Citizen Kane).  It's a good documentary, although perhaps a bit too quick to try and posit the film as an overwhelming success.  The commentary track features the same participants, and is a good listen.<br /><br />Not surprisingly, Linda Hamilton and Peter Horton ar enowhere to be found in the supplements, and don't even dream of an interview with Stephen King, for you will find one not.<br /><br />All in all, this is a fine special edition for a not-that-fine movie.<br /><br />But I can't help liking it, for some reason...
B00005JNEI|5.0|Whether you're a liberal or a conservative (or anywhere else on the political spectrum), this documentary is a must-see. I took a conservative friend of mine to see this film in theaters over the summer. Like so many others, he was an avid supporter of Bush because he had never been told why he shouldn't be. I asked him on the way into the theater who he was going to vote for. He replied \\"Bush, of course!\\" Knowing that we were walking into a movie which was sure to introduce many new issues to him, I said nothing. When it was over, as we were walking out, I asked him the same question once again. He replied, \\"Definitely not that *ss-hole!\\" Not knowing it was going to have such an impact on him, I said, \\"Who do you mean?\\" \\"George Bush,\\" he said, \\"I am absolutely not going to vote for George Bush.\\" This film had a wonderful impact on my friend and I am certain that it will on just about anyone else who watches it. I give this documentary five stars and a big smile!

078681859X|5.0|Bartimaeus is an ages old djinni who is annoyed to find himself summoned by a scrap of a boy and sent on a mission to steal the Amulet of Samarkand from a very powerful magician. The setting is London and magicians run the country as members of Parliment. The amulet is currently in the possession of one of the most powerful \\"politicians\\" in England. Who is this apprentice magician and why is he dabbling with powers beyond his years? Bartimaeus doesn't care, he just wants to fulfill his mission and be released. As the story unfolds we see the story though the kid's eyes and through the wry asides of the djinn in footnotes. In this society magicians may run the government but there are non-magic anarchists who are causing problems.<br /><br />The reader is drawn into this world. Nicholas is a very young but talented apprentice to a \\"master\\" who is a second rate magician/politician. Nicholas has known very little kindness in his young life and is impatient to advance his learning. Bartimaeus is a funny and saavy djinni who admires Nicholas in spite of himself.<br /><br />Even as the story concludes there are big questions that remain. Who are those street kids who seem to \\"sense\\" magic items and remain unaffected by it? Thankfully this is The Bartimaeus Trilogy and book two, The Golem's Eye has just been published, September 2004. I must get it now and see what happens next.

0783222475|4.0|Pierce Brosnan and Linda Hamilton star in this explosive movie about the town of Dante's Peak, where a long-dormant volcano is about to erupt with devastating force. <br /> <br />Brosnan stars as Harry Dalton.  He works for the U.S. Geological Survey office studying volcanoes.  He's notified of seismic activity occuring near Dante's Peak and he's sent to investigate.  Hamilton stars as Rachel Wando, the mayor of Dante's Peak.  Dante's Peak has recently been named as the second most desireable place to live in the United States with a population less than 20,000. <br /> <br />Soon, Harry and Rachel meet, and she shows him around the town.  Next, they drive up to the mountain so Harry can do some tests to determine if there's a chance of an eruption.  Two burnt bodies are discovered in a spring on the mountain.  Meanwhile, Harry reports to his boss that the whole area should be monitored.  Carbon dioxide in the soil is killing plants and animals, and the water has turned acidic.  Rachel calls a city council meeting, and Harry recommends evacuating the area, much to the displeasure of the council.  A new industry is locating to Dante's Peak, and the council fears that they will pull out due to the concern surrounding the volcano.   <br /> <br />Paul Dreyfus, Harry's Boss, played by Charles Hallahan, arrives in the town and he feels an alert is not needed.  The crew stays to monitor the condition of the mountain and to run more tests.  Harry still believes that the volcano is dangerous. <br /> <br />Readings are taken at the mountain, and all levels appear normal.  No eruption is expected to happen.  Meanwhile, Harry and Rachel have grown closer to each other.   <br /> <br />A special type pf machine is lowered down into the volcano to take more precise readings.  The machine malfunctions, and Terry, one of the scientists, goes down to investigate.  Just at that moment, an earthquake strikes and destroys the machine.  Terry is trapped under the rubble with a broken leg.A helicopter is flown in to rescue Terry and Harry.  Once on the ground, Harry and Paul have another confrontation.  Harry still believes that the volcano is going to erupt.  Paul believes that there's still nothing to worry about and informs Harry that the crew that they're pulling out. <br /> <br />Harry and Rachel get set to spend a last night together when Harry discovers that the water contains sulfur dioxide after Rachel's tap water is found to be contaminated.  He is able to convince Paul that something is definitely wrong.  The town is then put on alert and evacuation plans are made.  Ruth, Rachel's mother in law, lives on the mountain, but she refuses to evacuate her home.  As soon as an informational town meeting has been called, the volcano begins to erupt.  Chaos and panic occur as people try to get to safety. <br /> <br />Harry and Rachel leave to rescue Rachel's children.  However, the children have taken Rachel's truck to rescue their grandmother.  After some near misses from trees and rocks, Harry and Rachel manage to get to Ruth's home and rescue the children.  They all manage to escape in the nick of time as molten lava engulfs the house.  Their only hope of escape is to take a motorboat across the lake, but the volcanic activity has turned the water to acid, and its eating the metal of the boat away.  Soon, the motor's prop is gone, stalling the boat.  Ruth leaps into the acid water and pulls the boat to safety.  Despite saving the children, Rachel, and Harry, Ruth's legs are badly burned from the acid, and she dies on her mountain. <br /> <br />The National Guard arrives, and everyone in the town is evacuated to safety, but Paul is still there.  There's only one bridge left standing over the river.  The National Guard vehicles make it, but Paul is less fortunate.  Rachel, Harry, and the children manage to get off the mountain in a hot-wired pickup truck. <br /> <br />The volcano finally erupts in all its fury, and trees and houses are destroyedas though they were toys.  Now trapped underground, will Harry, Rachel, and the children survive, or is it too late? <br /> <br />I found this to be an exciting movie.  The special effects are very good, especially the eruptions and the subsequent ash cloud which levels the trees and houses.  The acting is good and the story keeps you on edge throughout the movie.  I recommend this movie very highly.  The special effects will blow you away.
B000024D4R|5.0|With guitarist David Gilmour delicately brushing Waters' canvas, he shows that great guitar playing can come by sacrificing speed for tone, and quantity for quality. These two guys had enormous chemistry when they were comrades, and this record may be the best example of their craft.<br />  Pink Floyd is one of those acts that creates a world with their sound. Gilmour creates a landscape of exquisite tone by playing half the notes of your average rock guitarist. He has the uncanny ability to send a shiver with only a single note. He plays under the notion that one note struck at the precise time, is more powerful than a basketful of notes played erratically; and it's amazingly effective.<br /><br />  As the record starts out, \\"Pigs On The Wing (Part One)\\" is just under a minute and a half, and it sets the mood for the rest of the record with a casual and relaxed acoustic sound. As we slide into the epic \\"Dogs\\", we find the band walking us through a maze of moods. Pink Floyd is all about mood. As we hear in \\"Dogs\\", we start with a slight acoustic trot that soon develops into a plateau of sound effects, and later into a more sturdy but anxious finale. The tempo change after the sound effects bridge, topped off by the powerful lyric \\"And when you lose control, you'll reap the harvest you have sown\\", is nothing short of brilliant. The transition from mood to mood is unparalleled. No one does this like Floyd, ....no one. As the record moves us through \\"Pigs (Three Different Ones)\\", \\"Sheep\\", and back to the relaxed acoustic strumming of \\"Pigs On The Wing (Part Two)\\" to finish off the record, we feel like we're being taken on a journey. Now I hate to be redundant but, ....no one does this like Floyd either, no one.<br />  Now, the whole concept behind this album is very interpretive, but it is no doubt political in nature. With lines like \\"Hey you, Whitehouse, Ha ha charade you are\\". This line was directed toward the British Moral Majority figure Mary Whitehouse. Mrs. Whitehouse was the self-appointed head of the National Viewers and Listeners Association, which \\"campaigns for broad national moral standards in radio and TV.\\" She's been known for openly denouncing Floyd and promoting censorship since their beginning in '67.<br />  It has been said that Waters was partly inspired by George Orwell's classic novel Animal Farm in which people are divided up into groups represented by animals. However you like to interpret Waters lyrics, one thing is definite; Pink Floyd's \\"Animals\\" is a masterful example of conceptual musical art, crafted by a group of stupendous musicians.<br />For more Dr. Music reviews, visit [...]e was the self-appointed head of the National Viewers and Listeners Association, which \\"campaigns for broad national moral standards in radio and TV.\\" She's been known for openly denouncing Floyd and promoting censorship since their beginning in '67.

B0002TSZK6|1.0|Fahrenheit 9/11 was a major disappointment to me. I have been a fan of Michael Moore's for several years and have found his other films to be excellent (Roger & Me, Bowling for Culumbine). I found this film to go way beyond the boundries of a documentary. Being in the motion picture industry myself, it was fairly easy for me to see the subtle manipulations he used to get the audience to feel the way he wanted. I think it's very sad when someone uses their talent & influence for their own personal desires without any regard for the truth. I wish people would keep art & politics separate from each other. You lost a fan on this one Michael.
0393035158|5.0|Faith\\" is a euphemism for a willingness to be deceived--either by our own ignorance or through the concerted actions of others. The ability to reason -- to pose questions and to seek answers for ourselves based on evidence is what defines civilized society. History is filled with the atrocities of peoples who were willing to follow without question. <br /> <br />Just as important as forming new ideas is learning how to toss the old ones away. <br /> <br />\\"Bully a kid long enough and he'll say he started the Chicago fire.\\" <br /> <br />It's a testament to the power of childhood indoctrination (and substandard education) that we can live among so much internally consistent knowledge and continue to hold on to pixie dust. Strongly asserting a world view without corroborative evidence is blatantly dishonest. Thanks to an overabundance of political correctness, religious adherents have devolved from claiming that <br /> <br />\\"if science can't explain it, God exists\\" <br /> <br />to <br /> <br />\\"if I'm too ignorant to understand it, God exists.\\" <br /> <br />You don't need to be liberal to see the foolishness of religion--you just need a brain willing to ask questions to see how barren faith really is and how fascinating a world free of the cartoonish bugaboos of religion really is. <br /> <br />An argument from ignorance isn't strenghtened with scented candles and robes. But it appears that rambling stories from books written by people who couldn't master indoor plumbing qualifies as evidence for a great number of us
0064407667|5.0|I've been passing these books by everytime I saw them in my local bookstore, thinking that they look interesting, but never really bothering with them. Now, I'm glad that I did pick up the first, and despite it's shortness, it's left me hungry to read the rest. I find the story very interesting, and I found it very cool that the author warns you of the unpleasantness of it all. I like unpleasant stories, occasionally, so this hit the spot. I'm going to go out and buy The Reptile Room very soon. ^_^ I really enjoyed this one.
B0000JCFPE|1.0|On first viewing it's check out the architecture and guess the killer.  On second viewing it's check out the clothes and guess the killer. On the third viewing it's the dawning realization that this is a revisionist feminist revenge chick flick (whatever that means) with few redeeming features made for the tackiest of Hollywood reasons - let's give the suckers what they want - sex, ice picks wielded by braless women under forty, and lots of expensive clothes and fast cars.  The greatest suspense comes from the awful overacting Mr Douglas who is trying to give up smoking - will he? Won't he? Ms Stone iks embarrassingly bad.  It is redeemed somewhat by Mr Dzundza and the elegant Ms Tripplehorn.  And yes, I am a slow learner as this film made squillionsof dollars and I thought thousands of paying customers could not be wrong so I looked at it three times.  And yes I am a sucker.
B000031WD9|1.0|This movie is trying to be the next Porky's.  Ya know what the difference between these two movies is? Porky's is actually kind of funny and it came out in the 80's.  That should help you to gain some perspective on how tired this premise is.    To suggest that this movie has anything resembling a cohesive plot is ludicrous.  I could take a dump on a piece of notebook paper and it would be a better movie script.  Nevertheless,here it is in a nutshell:    Jason Biggs plays some big nosed goober who has three other friends played by Chris Klein, the guy from The Rundown whose not  The Rock, and some other guy who popped up in the infinitley superior comedy (...)They all make a vow to lose their virginity by prom, which will of course lead to all sorts of sexually charged, teenage hijinks.    The majority of the film is spent on Biggs emberassing himself by doing auch things as prematurely(...). Speaking of the infamous pie scene, it's fairly obvious that some screenwriter thought this scene would be funny and the rest of the film was built around this one scene.  This is the only way to explain the mind numbingly infuriating lack of a decent story (or jokes for that matter.)    As for the rest of the characters, Chris Kattan plays the football jock with an ugly girlfriend, Stifler gets peed on and thinks it's champagne, Freddy has sex with Stifler's mom and the other guy knocks boots with generic Hollywood blowup doll Tara Reid for a girlfriend.  Speaking of Stifler's mom this movie popularized that idiotic MILF phrase that has been circulating among pea brained highschoolers since this cinematic abomination was first released.    Oh yeah, Biggs has sex with a band kid who pleasures herself using a flute or a clarinet, or something. Naturally after this putrid film came out all the Teenybopper and entertainment magazines had features on this ugly, pasty, redheaded freckle factory as though she's actually attractive.    The worst part about this movie is that impressionable, idiot teens who have rotted their brains by listening to Nelly and playing X Box who see this movie will try to emulate the ridiculous characters in this film.  Avoid this movie at all costs.  Calling this movie funny is like calling having a flaming drill burrow into your skull fun.
B000007UA4|4.0|Kylie's fourth album and final orginal studio album for PWL studios is a mixed offering and may not appeal to all tastes. Released in 1991, the album finds Kylie finishing up her contractual obligation to the declining PWL studios and producers Stock & Waterman (now down to a duo with the exit of Matt Aitken)and taking an active role in songwriting. The music scene itself is changing with early 90s dance on the wane and the grunge scene just over the horizon. The result is a mish-mash of styles and a more mature production that is clearly a departure for Kylie. Lead-off single \\"word is Out\\" with its Urban/ Hip-Hop sound was a disaster at UK #16 and broke Kylie's string of top ten hits. The album fared poorly in the UK charts but eventually yielded 2 hit singles, a cover of \\"give me just a little more time\\" and ballad \\"if you were with me now.\\" The album soon faded which is a shame as it contains some of Kylie's best songs. Here is a track by track review:<br /><br />01`Word is Out - A departure from Kylie's typical Hi-NRG dance, \\"word is Out\\" featured a slowed down and very Urban sound. A song about a cheating lover, the video featured Kylie as a raunchy street girl amid suppossed pimps and street gangs. The single was radically remixed in Australia as \\"the summer breeze mix.\\" Not Kylie's best moment.<br /><br />02 Give me Just a Little more Time - PWL relied heavily on covering old classics to secure a UK hit and this track is no exception. The song is a fairly fathful rendition of the Chairman of the Board's original track with some extra vocal stuttering thrown in for good effect. A decnt cover but overall pretty unremarkable.<br /><br />03. Too much of a Good Thing - A mid-tempo dance track that borrows heavily from the sound created by Lisa Lisa & Cult Jam. The interesting thing about this song is that Kylie's vocals are so low that it sounds like the background singers dominate the track. The song is great dance-pop with its laid-back vibe and sampled voice-over telling us \\"We're gonna do it-lets get to it!\\"<br /><br />04 Fioer Feelings - One of the tracks to give Kylie a writing credit and actually one of her most mature works ever. The song is very atypical PWL in sound and the single version even more so with its Brothers-In Rhythm remix. The song is a slow, cool ballad with kylie asking 'what is love without the finer feelings?' A true-standout track from the album with an awesome B&W video to match it.<br /><br />05. If You Were With Me Now - One of the top ten hits from the album is also a duet with American RnB singer Keith Washington. A fairly straightforward ballad not too far removed from Kylie's early nega-hit \\"especially for you\\" In all honestly its pretty boring but inoffensive stuff.<br /><br />06. Lets Get To It - The title track is probably the hardest track on the album to describe in terms of musical style. A mid-tempo, slightly hip-hop sounding track with bouncy synths and some strings for good measures. Once again background vocals seems to dominate (this time predominately male) with their \\"ooohs\\" while Kylie invites us to \\"lets get to it- right now.\\" I could see where people would hate this song although personally I found it to grow on me with additional listens.<br /><br />07. Right Here, Right Now - If Ever there was a woefully missed single opportunity in Kylie's career,\\"right Here, Right Now\\" would be it. No other track on the album explemfies why Stock Aitken Waterman's brand of dance-pop dominated the UK charts in the late 80s. With its thumping bass, big brass and relentless beats \\"right Here, right now\\" would justify the purchase of the album alone. Kylie's vocals are super sexy as she beckons her lover to come to her \\"right here, right now.\\" Arguably the best track on the album.<br /><br />08.Live & Learn - Stylistically similar to \\"too much of a good thing\\" without Kylie's voice drowned in background singers. A rather positive message about moving on. Nothing much to talk about but a decent track.<br /><br />09. No World Without You - Another ballad and one thats pretty good. A nearly acoustic track with Kylie being accompanied primarily a guitar. Kylie delivers a great performance.<br /><br />10. I Guess I like it Like That - Obviously influenced by the Belgian brand of techno that was being made by 2 Unlimted and AB Logic, this track features Kylie in full techno rave mode. The song itself is a frantic mix of 130+ bpms, vocal loops, and piano breakdowns. I believe many fans felt like this was the musical direction Kylie's post-PWL career with DecOnstruction would take. A hyper and rather fitting end to a great album.<br /><br />Overall \\"Lets get to it\\" finds Kylie experimenting with a wide range of musical styles in order to try and grow musically. Hip-Hop, rave, RnB, techno and acoustic pop are all found here in an eclectic mix. On first listen the album would sound like a horrible mix. However,upon further listening I believe most people would appreciate most tracks and the album as a whole. Having listened to it for 10+ years I think its one of Kylie's most interesting and underated albums.about but a decent track. <br /> <br />09.

B00005JNEI|1.0|(...) This movie made the entire US Army look like a bunch of uneducated, ruthless killers.  This movie is so one sided and anti Bush.  While the facts presented in this documentary may be true, if you buy this movie you might as well go fight along side the Talian and the other terrorist organizations fighting US forces in the Middle East.  As an American soldier that fought in Operation Enduring Freedom IV, I came home to this movie that totally belittled the US Army.  Mr Moore portrays the US Army as an organization that thrives on tricking young, poor, uneducated Americans into enlisting for the US Army.  While that is totally untrue he even still protrays the Army as a killing machine that enjoys killing innocent Iraqi civilians.  Althought the movie is dedicated to those fighting in Iraq and Afghanistan; if you have an ounce of patriotism and pride for the country in which you live then I highly recomend passing on this movie.  Coming home to this movie was like coming home to a kick in the balls!
B0001FR3IG|5.0|If you're inclined to watch a good, well-done ghost story (and October is the perfect month for that!) then this may be just the film you're looking for.  While it is more in line with being a thriller than a horror flick, it is nevertheless pretty creepy and is sure to be a fun & macabre date movie.<br /><br />The film stars Halle Berry and Penelope Cruz as two inmates of a woman's mental institution.  Both women are normally quite attractive, but the film does a credible job of dumbing down their beauty to make them look like authentic prisoners.  In fact, there were times I could barely believe that Cruz was the same girl who starred in WOMEN ON TOP.<br /><br />Berry plays a woman who had previously been a shrink at the institution.  That is to say, until she flipped out and killed her hubby.  As to WHY she went homocidal is the crux of the plot.[As a sidenote, for those who would enjoy watching a psychologist humbled and getting psycho-analzyed herself, this DVD might be worth it JUST for that aspect alone!]<br /><br />The best parts of this movie are the sets.  You don't see the sunshine the entire movie and the grey, dark & morose timbre of the film makes the prison complex seem like something straight out of Dante's INFERNO.  They do a good job of creating an eerie feeling that pervades the entire story.<br /><br />One final note:  while one of the reasons this film is categorized as \\"R\\" is that there is nudity, keep in mind that there is none.  Halle Berry has taken her clothes off in other flicks (SWORDFISH, MONSTER'S BALL) but not this one.  Just so you know.<br /><br />If you like movies such as WHAT LIES BENEATH and THE SIXTH SENSE, you're sure to enjoy this one.  In fact, there are some parallels between this DVD and WLB.  If movies that explore the concept of a ghostly world beyond are not your thing, then this movie is most assuredly not one that would pique your interest.
0062502182|3.0|...yes! Keep It Short and Simple is what best describes this book. Finished reading this book recently and made my belief to believe in my dreams and ambitions stronger. In fact my mom who doesn't like reading books too often, read the book too.<br /><br />Good fable. Simply go ahead, read, and enjoy!

B00005JNEI|1.0|I was not overly impressed by the movie. Most of the 'facts' were distorted or reported out of context, but I fully expected that.   <br /> <br />What annoyed me the most, however, was the 'demonizing' camera tricks used.  Nearly every clip with Bush or any administration figure was edited so the persons eyes looked almost totally black.  I wasn't expecting this and it really detracted heavily from the movie.
B000002672|5.0|Well I guess I should pay my respect to this <br />awesome album, I own it both on vinyl and CD <br />and it was my first Accept album, it quickly became  <br />my favourite. So today I returned to it after maybe <br />5 years and I have to say that it still holds up. <br />And I just love the gang backing vocals it just sounds great. <br />So I rate it pretty high maybe nr 1...hm well I don't know.. it's one of their finest, in my mind anyway!! <br />
B00005JNBQ|5.0|When asked what my favorite movie of the year is, it's no contest here. Napolean Dynamite easily surpasses anything that has been out so far, and I'm sure, anything yet to come. The best comedy I've seen since Office Space, I'd say. Any bad reviews are to be ignored. It's one of those films where a plot simply isn't necessary, and you almost forget there isn't one until walking out of the theatre. The humor is so dry and random, not to mention the hilarious elevator music that seems to correspond with the crazy nature of the film. The charactar I most enjoyed was Kip, because his transition from dork to gangster was so enjoyable, and somehow managed to be believeable as well. Just the tone of his voice was enough to keep me in stitches. I also think Summer (Haylee Duff), was especially great to watch on screen in her role. You instantly saw her as every Summer you may have had in your school, and automatically rooted for her demise. Yes, I'd go so far as to say this movie is about to become a cult classic.
0345350499|5.0|The Mists of Avalon was a beautifully written, engrossing novel.  Although it seems that a lot of reviewers were looking for historical and religious accuracy, it is important to point out that this novel is simply a retelling of a legend.  It's a story, not a history.  The beauty of a book such as this is that you can suspend reality and escape into a world that is not based in pure fact.  There has been much criticism of this novel's treatment of religion, but the reality is that Christianity was imposed upon the Celts during the Roman occupation of Britain.  This is important to the telling of Arthurian legend.  It is not a slam on modern Chrisitanity, nor should anyone be offended by the simplified, somewhat inaccurate portrayal of early Celtic Paganism, which is perhaps more favorable in this book.  Don't look for religious lessons from this book, but accept that religion is an important motivator in the plot. <br /> <br />As to the notion that the characters are uninteresting, I can only say that I disagree.  I thought that the book had incredible characterization.  The complexity of the individuals in the book may have passed over some readers heads, but it is there in spades.  Many will find Gwenhwyfar whiny, but I sympathized with her in some ways.  She was entirely a product of her upbringing, much of it based on Christianity.  She was also one of the most loyal characters, and showed genuine love for Arthur and Lancelet.  It was Morgaine whom I found to be jealous, immature and vengeful.  Her actions were more selfish than Gwenhwyfar's because she manipulated sitations that had power to destroy the kingdom.  Gwenhwyfar manipulated situations for herself, yes, but usually only out of love for Lancelet (and occasionally Arthur)or a need to be accepted and loved as more than just an arm ornament for Arthur. <br /> <br />The reality is that most people are complex, and truth be told, not every aspect of our personalities are likeable.  If we were honest withourselves, many motivations, even from the kindest people, come from selfish desires.  Women should know best of all that although we may love one another, we may even be friends, there exists an element of competition among us all, especially in youth.  I found the Mists of Avalon to hold a great deal of truth about human nature, and perhaps an understanding that the reason that perfection, symbolized by the kingdom of Camelot, can never exist for long in this world is because nobody is entirely pure.
B0002VKZL6|5.0|What has always impressed me most about Knopfler's work wasnt the show-off blazing stuff, but the way that the phrasing, the timing, the choice of just *that* note at just *that* time, was always slightly startling... and always absolutely the perfect choice. <br /> <br />In this album Knopfler manages to get that same feel, unified and  infused throughout the lyrics, the singing, the timing, the story of every one of his songs.  He doesnt need to pop a blazing solo; his ability to use just the right three words to make his message, and somehow overlay that with a perfectly chosen hesitation in his timing, and with his guitar somehow retelling the same story as he sings it, is much more impressive. <br /> <br />I bought this album after hearing Stand Up Guy on the radio, and loved the entire album at first hearing.  I've listened straight through 5 times now, and like it more each time, and I'm just beginning to see all the depth of what he put in here. <br /> <br />Be warned, this is a very political album.  Some reviewers here have commented on the political content of some of the songs, and that Dont Crash the Ambulance seems jarring at the end. I found Ambulance to be a perfect summary of what he had done throughout the album.  Each of these songs somehow fits into Knopfler's political scheme, even those with no overt political message; they seem to introduce grace notes that highlight just the right tone of the political message that came before and after.
B00005JNEI|5.0|Farenheit 9/11 speaks volumes because it speaks the truth!!!  If this movie had any false allegations, Michael Moore would have already been sued for libel and slander.  But seeing as how nobody has challenged Moore on the facts used in the movie, it is a clear indication that Farenheit 9/11 is nothing other than the truth!!<br /><br />This is a POWERFUL movie which resonates many different emotions in the hearts of the American people.  While watching this movie, I felt sick to my stomach, I was in tears, I was angry, and I was countless other things!<br /><br />People can call this propaganda all they want, but it is simply the TRUTH!  There is nothing more to say other than the fact that Michael Moore is a talented filmmaker and has lots of guts doing the work he does.
0198613474|5.0|Precise, comprehensive, meticulous, rich: for extent and scope - the only single volume dictionary of English to own (namely, for those seeking a non-American English dictionary (in practice, a non-Merriam-Webster work)). <br /> <br />Editors Catherine Soanes and Angus Stevenson have revised and updated the pioneering work of Judy Pearsall (Editor) and Patrick Hanks (Chief Editor, Current English Dictionaries) who led production of the outstanding `The New Oxford Dictionary of English' in 1998. <br /> <br />This revision builds upon that body of work - adding 3,000 fresh words, senses and phrases.  The editors and their team drew upon a new 100 million word Oxford English corpus.  As with the 1998 dictionary, it focuses its definitions on current usage.  <br /> <br />What gives this indispensable breadth and depth is its layout of core senses and subsenses within each definition and the provision of word history: etymology (word origin) and morphology (word form) as well as reference to development of both sense and form.   <br /> <br />This provides a rich reference work that would strengthen anyone's vocabulary and sharpen accuracy of expression. <br /> <br />This edition also adds usage guidance where prudent and includes new Appendices: a very useful `Guide to Good English' and encyclopaedia like information (including: countries and their capitals; weights & measures; punctuation marks; alphabets; the chemical elements; data on the solar system; proofreading marks; Prime Ministers and Presidents; Internet Forum & Chatroom keystroke emoticons :~) and shorthand (`FYI' etc); collective nouns; and even categories of wind forces!). <br /> <br />While it might retain the typical dryness and staidness of the Oxford English Dictionary (OED), this volume surely sets a global standard for single volume works (cf. Merriam-Webster). The OED might occasionally omit some shades of meaning in current usage and be slow to take up new words due to its staff being too academic by nature and out of touch.  <br /> <br />Surely as a living language flows through everyday life, such dictionaries help fight the mudslides?  <br /> <br />Its sibling Thesaurus is equally worthwhile, having also undergone useful revision and improvement.
B000002H6C|4.0|Dont get me wrong, this album is a great album, but because of the loss of Master Burton (he IS the Master) the band seemingly lost its edge.  <br />  I can stem their first mistake as far back as the Kill 'em All days when they booted Dave Mustaine off the band. I loved Kirk Hammetts guitar talent but he was no Mustaine and since then they have done fine...until this. The first mistake of this album is complexity, now I love when songs are long and interesting, but God! They are REALLY overdoing it! The second mistake is the lack of extreme guitar solos, I know Kirk Hammett was an excellent guitarist but this album does not let you realize that at all. Now the third and most brutal mistake is obviously the lack of good production. Hell if it wasn't for the production this would probably get 5 stars. Its just terrible, I could have recorded the songs better in my shed for Gods sake! Huge flaw.  <br />  Now that the bad things are asside we can now focus on why this album deserves a high rating: <br />  Reason 1: 'One'. This is by far the best song on the album and probably the best song after the Cliff Burton era. All I can say is that I was blown away by this masterpiece. It goes from a semi-balladic setting in the beginning to an all out thrash song followed by the greatest guitar solo ever at the end. Truly a masterpiece. <br />  Reason 2: Maturity. Metallica has matured so much after Master of Puppets, they haven't changed this much since the time between Kill Em' All and Ride the Lightning. Appearence has also changed, especially James Hetfields. James' hair got a lot darker, his face changed a bit and he grew a mustache...all within one year (he looked exactly the same as he did in MOP in '87). Kirk Hammett also grew a mustache and Lars got rid of the mullett...finally. The songs have also matured and are more toward everyday life/war with the title track and One. This IS a good thing. <br />  Reason 3: Jason Newsted. Some of you true fans may argue with me onthis one and no, Jason does not rival Cliff Burton...not by a longshot but while he was no Cliff Burton he WAS the next best thing. Metallica could have just blown it off and randomly picked a bassist but they took their time and picked one who had talent. I think he carried the torch this and the Black Album. A talented man indeed. <br />  Well thats all the major reasons. Now I will rate the songs. <br /> Blackened - A <br /> ...And Justice for All - A+ <br /> Eye of the Beholder - A+ <br /> One - A++++++ <br /> The Shortest Straw - B <br /> Harvester of Sorrow - B+ <br /> Frayed Ends of Sanity - B <br /> To Live is to Die - A+++++ (Greatest instrumental EVER!!!) <br /> Dyers Eve - A <br /> <br />Overall you might think its unfair to give this four stars, well....no its not. Anyway this is a great album and deserves your money. This is also the final true Metallica album and the Black Album, while above average, will never measure up to the early masterpieces. Dont get me started on how this is better than the Loads or St. Anger either.  <br /> <br />PS: If an Elektra associate reads this then PLEASE get this gem remastered, then I'll probably give it 5 stars.

B0000029DD|5.0|10 Years on and there are still none who surpass the skill and imagination of Jeff Buckley and Grace.  As an album, and creation, there are few to beat it, I admit there are bands who on a one off occasion come to match SOME of the tracks on Grace (Radiohead, Coldplay, yada, yada) but as a whole Grace is an Everest in musical terms.  To own it is to really appreciate what independance in music means, although signed to a large label Jeff Buckley wrote HIS music in his way, any comparisons to his father end at the similarity in voice.  Jeff was a true \\"artist\\" whose music like that of Presley, Zeplin, the Beatles and Hendrix will never be equalled.  I know that this review doesn't describe the tracks and their \\"composure\\" but that isn't necessary in Jeff Buckleys case, this is an album everyone should own whatever musical taste you possess.    If only as a monument to one of the greatest musicians of the 20th century this album should be bought and passed on through the masses as an example of what is capable if musicans are allowed to \\"do their job\\" as opposed to spawning albums at the bequest of the record conglomorates.    To be honest it's a really great album which I still love 10 years after buying it.  There is no good reason not to buy it, it is a great album and, unfortunately as Jeff Buckley is dead, this is one of the few monuments to his existence which you can still be part of.  I'm just a fan, not a greedy record exec trying to make one last buck out of J.B., buy it new, second hand, anyway, just as long as you own it you won't regret it.    And don't forget to listen to 'Grace' and 'Lover, you should have come over' as loud as possible to piss off the neighbours.  Scratch that listen to the whole album at whatever volume you like just listen to it.
B00000I8NC|5.0|dude, you just dont \\"get it\\" 1 learn how to use inverted commas. <br />2. Actually listen to the music withou \\"thinking\\" about the political view point of the artist. Let the crazy violins and crashing drums lead you off to a wonder world. Have a good smoke and watch your mind expand. Let the sublimnal beauty of the crazy monolouges inspire you. <br /> <br />You have awful taste in music and are practically illiterate, sort it out.
068987474X|2.0|I decided to read this book after hearing about it from friends and family. I just wanted to see what all the hype was about. Okay, the book is funny, but there is nothing new here. It's the same advice and information that my mom used to give to me when I first started dating. Maybe this book would have been useful if I was 13 and not 30.
B000002X2B|2.0|They should have just called it \\"Blows\\" and dropped the rest of the title.
B00005JLXE|5.0|Daredevil the theatrical film had tough obstacles to rise above: how do you combine the original Bill Everett/Stan Lee Daredevil as well as the Frank Miller Daredevil as well as the Daredevil's of Colan and Bendis etcetera? I liked that approach but it caused some criticisms and hopefully they were dealt with to some degree by the bonus disc in the DVD set which presented the history of Daredevil and the aritsts and writers who had been involved all incarnations of the character. The bonus disc did a nice job of explaining the background of the comic and made it clear that the film tried to embrace the whole history of Daredevil. Other major obstacles the film faced were cuts to make it shorter and PG-13. Relaeasing an alternate cut should help improve things. The Daredevil Director's Cut DVD will no doubt further improve an already great film.

0060989157|5.0|This is a must. I grew up listening to Motley Crue. I was about 10 years old listening to what my brothers were listening too. I learn to really love this band. From my teenage fantasy to my very 1st and last concert they ROCKED. They have always been top of my list. This book was well written and captured you from page one! From the forming of the band, to the crazy wild stuff they would do, the drugs, the girls, the cars, etc... It was a great ride that you did't want to end. I cried when you went through Vince's daughter Skylar dying at age 4, to Nikki over dosing, to laughing at crazy wild stuff they would do and in awe of some other things that would happen! I would highly recommend this book. The book is worth the money! Can't wait for a follow up!
B000000OAN|5.0|Wow, never realized how good this album was until just now. <br /> <br />Party.
B0002Z0EYA|2.0|I do not wish to waste too much time telling you what a disappointment this dreadful film was. 5 Stars to Peter O'Toole, once again proving how talentless and un-starlike todays actors are. Rent \\"Helen of Troy\\"!<br /><br />Better yet, see \\"Gladiator\\".
B0002OERI0|5.0|I could go on a rant on how alot of the bad reviews are just that bad amungst themselves. But nah I was 13 and heard dookie and just back tracked from there and after dookie they did things that were diff etc. But I have to say this is closer back to the sound I like than \\"time of your life\\" it just did nothing for me that simple.    So I never considers these guys punk(except if I were to choose a PUNKISH sounding band this would be them...and besides you posers thinking its the way you sound,dress etc. are idiots, that only counts in MUSIC catergorization and segregation. As long as there is something to hate there will always be punks. Its that simple.  The album greens my day = teh wr0kz0r      EAT IT
B00008H2LB|3.0|Linkin Park's first album (Hybrid Theory) is one of the best albums I've heard. Each song is good! With such creativity in Hybrid Theory, I was kind of expecting something new from Linkin Park, but I guess it's well known that the using the same formula again will make the CD work again. I wasn't expecting something totally different, but the songs in Meteora will really remind you on songs in Hybrid Theory (Compare Figure.09 to One Step Closer) Although Meteora is not as creative as Hybrid Theory, it isn't necessarily bad. It's actually worth listening to. Give a chance to songs like \\"Breaking the Habit\\" (This is a really good song, I'm very disappointed on how much the radio and TV overplay it. But if you forget about how much they play it, overall, it's a great song!)  <br /> <br />1. Foreword: An a really short intro to the upcoming song. <br />2. Don't Stay: A catchy tune. With polished guitars and a catchy chorus. <br />3. Somewhere I Belong: The first single off Meteora. I really don't consider this song to be that great. In this song, Linkin Park sings about forgetting all the pain...something a little bit more positive. <br />4. Lying From You: This song is actually not that bad. I think it's worth listening to. <br />5. Hit The Floor: One of the disappointing songs of Meteora. Kind of a filler song in the album =( <br />6. Easier to Run: Although not a Linkin Park classic song, it's kind of catchy, and it has a bit of feeling to it. Much better than \\"Hit the Floor\\" in my opinion!! <br />7. Faint: This is a really catchy tune! =P Very fast paced and full of angst (\\"I won't be ignored!!\\") It's one of the decent songs in the album. <br />8. Figure.09: The OTHER disappointing/filler song in Meteora. <br />9. Breaking the Habit: This is probably the BEST song in Meteora. I'm just so sorry that MTV and the radio play it so much! They can quickly ruin and a song that's really worth listening. <br />10. From the Inside: Many people don't like the Japanese flutes in this song, but the song is not that bad. It's a decent song. <br />12. Session: This is the \\"Cure for the Itch\\" song on Meteora. Instrumental and short. <br />13. Numb: NOT the greatest song, but not TERRIBLE, either. It's the kind of song you have to listen a couple of times to get it. <br /> <br />Overall, Meteora is DECENT. Some songs really disappoint you, but it still has listenable stuff. I'm still very curious to see what new material Linkin Park awaits us with.
B0000013GT|5.0|It's real hard to tell which album was OutKast's best. Personally, I reckon ATLiens is BY FAR their most promising and thoughtful albums. OutKast do the unexpected here where they take us on a trip up to space and explore the wonders of life. I can't stress just how DOPE this album is, it has everything: unstoppable production, untouchable lyrics and an unbelievable album cover with art inside the book. Check out Two Dope Boyz, Jazzy Belle and Wheelz of Steel, OutKast extend their knowledge to the very extent where it can't go no more. Also, their flow is so mind-blowing, it'd even confuse the mind of the brainiest person living on earth. And, uh, excuse Ms. Idon'tcare, but don't worry about the beat on E.T., it fits perfectly and is so dark. However, it you want to visit (or revisit) OutKast at their best on here, view 13th Floor/Growing Old. The name itself makes the song look good and I ESPECIALLY love the intro where the man speaks truthfully and fully.    Best moments= Jazzy Belle, E.T. and 13th Floor/Growing Old
0553382179|5.0|This system may seem a little corny to some out there, but it REALLY works!  I am a mother of four children, ages 13,10,7,5, and I started homeschooling this year. Eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeekkkkkkkk!  I am a born-organizer and perfectionist, who always felt like I was behind, so I knew that I would need help. Marla does a great job with women who have that same mentality.   My house is usually clean and in order, but Marla does a great job addressing the issues that affect even the cleanest household, like \\"Hot Spots...any area, that as soon as you lay a piece of paper on it, the paper begins to multiply and before you know it, the surface will be covered.\\"  We ALL have those spots.  Not only does Marla help you get organized, keep your house clean, and get rid of things that you don't LOVE (clutter), but also teaches you to fight for your own time, time with your children, and with your spouse--very important things to remember!  She encourages you without making you feel overwelmed, actually quite the opposite.  She constantly reminds you to take it slow, one change at a time, one step at a time. <br /> <br />     There IS a Christian view which Marla takes (and some don't like this), but I give her KUDOS for doing so. As a matter of fact, she starts off her aknowledgments introducing us to \\"God Breezes\\".  What better way to begin a book than talking about GOD!  Our society has turned so far away from having a thankful, giving, blessed mentality.  Besides, the ideas and principles in the book are what real Christian women believe and know to be true anyway, we just need help sorting through the negatives that we are constantly bombarded with! <br /> <br />     This is not a book that teaches you how to clean or what products to use, etc.  It is primarily for busy families, or for those who don't know how to get rid of clutter.  Even though I don't have much clutter, I still learned alot about how to stay that way. <br /> <br />     Thank you, FlyLady, for your fun (but serious) approach to getting our lives in order!
B000002I27|4.0|\\"Strange Days\\" is just what you would expect to find in terms of a second album from a new group that has just put out a smash debut album.  The self-titled first album of the Doors culled the group's best songs from their repertoire.  Most of the songs here were written around the same time and if you had to reshuffle the tracks from the first pair of albums to make the debut effort even better you are talking about the title track, \\"Love Me Two Times\\" and \\"People Are Strange.\\"  The music is still the distinctive combination of psychedelic instrumentation and unconventional arrangements with the poetic visions of Jim Morrison, but the results are just not quite as great as that first outing.<br /><br />The opening track is interesting because in addition to Ray Manzarek's organ, Robbie Krieger's guitar, and John Densmore's drum, they have actually added a session musician, Doug Lubhan, to play bass.  Meanwhile, Morrison sings about how \\"Strange days have found us/Strange days have tracked us down/They're going to destroy/Our casual joys/We shall go on playing/Or find a new town.\\"  There is a point there and the youth culture and the Sixties, but I find it hard to believe most of the people listening to this album in 1967 were thinking deep thoughts.  \\"Love Me Two Times\\" is the big blues-rocker on the album, distinguished by Kreiger's captivating guitar riff and the great harpsichord solo from Manzarek.  I know Morrison was the photogenic front man for the Doors, Manzarek and Kreiger were just as responsible for the group's unique sound.<br /><br />\\"Love Me Two Times\\" was a minor hit single off of the album, but its ascendancy was derailed when Morrison was arrested at a gig in New Haven, Connecticut.  The first single released from the album was \\"People Are Strange,\\" a rather simple song with Morrison singing about how \\"People are strange when you're a stranger/Faces look ugly when you're alone,\\" starting off against Krieger's guitar playing before adding a bit of honkey tonk piano.  Again there is a notion of Morrison singing about being outcasts and embracing the notion.  The difference is this time the music stays out of the way so the lyrics stand out more.<br /><br />Of the rest of the tracks on \\"Strange Days\\" the best are the weird \\"You're Lost Little Girl\\" and the funky \\"Moonlight Drive,\\" which may well be the oldest Doors song around and which again features Manzarak's keyboard playing.  \\"My Eyes Have Seen You\\" and \\"I Can't See Your Face In My Mind\\" are nothing special and then the album ends with the 11-minute \\"When the Music's Over.\\"  This was a big number when the group played live (the alternative last song to \\"The End\\"), but it loses something in the studio.  There is a solid beginning and end, but in the middle everybody gets to improvise while Morrison screams about ecological issues.  However, the jamming tends to detract from the song as a political statement.  All things considered, \\"Strange Days\\" would probably be considered a better album if we did not compare it to \\"The Doors.\\"it of honkey tonk piano.

B0002OERI0|5.0|Here's the thing about most of the bad reviews -- almost all of them mention the political heat of the album, whether it's to bash it or claim that it doesn't make the band punk. Unfortunately, all they do is make themselves look like idiots -- any moron listening to this can tell that there is exactly one thinly-veiled reference to President Bush, in \\"Holiday.\\" Next time listen to the album before you decide to enlighten us and throw your punker-than-thou credentials at us. <br /> <br />Oh, and by the way -- Green Day doesn't claim to be punk or hardcore. They know what they are, so it isn't as if by crying, \\"They're not punk!\\" you're releasing a revelation upon all of us. Despite what some of you think, we are just as smart as you and can think just as well. <br /> <br />Whew. On to the album. <br /> <br />\\"American Idiot\\" is a great album. There, I said it. It's a great album. There is not a bad song here (though my personal tastes oppose \\"Are We the Waiting\\" a bit). It is apparent that they spent a lot of time on this record, as it is highly evolved both lyrically and musically. Yes, I'm aware it's still mostly three-chord melodies, but among the many bands doing this today, Green Day are undoubtedly the masters of the format. <br /> <br />The album tells the story of Jesus of Suburbia, a normal kid like you and me. Disillusioned and bored with suburbia, he rebels -- against what, we're not quite sure, but then again most kids these days (myself included) are simply rebelling against the preconceived notions of what we're supposed to be. He creates an alternate identity -- St. Jimmy -- and for a few years, he's in a glorious daze. Unfortunately, he has to come back to reality, and the album closes with him doing just that. He is an identifiable character, one that you will recognize or remember from adolesence. <br /> <br />\\"American Idiot\\" is highly recommended. Every song reveals Billie Joe Armstrong's uncanny ability to create hooks and deep but identifiablelyrics. This is how good the album is -- I began making a list of standout tracks, but then I realized I was writing down every song. So get it yourself, and see what so many people are talking about. Unless you're a poor misguided punker who is convinced that Green Day is trying to invade your precious territory, or you're a hardcore Republican that can't even stomach one insult of our dear president, you should get your money's worth.
B00005JKMQ|4.0|The ad campaign for \\"Ali\\" focused on Will Smith's Oscar nominated portrayal of Muhammed Ali, but in the end I found this to really be director Michael Mann's film. Like \\"The Last of the Mohicans,\\" this is also a film where the leading man looks intently while the music surges. Mann has always been enamored of letting music carry a moment (first evidenced by his use of \\"In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida\\" for the climatic scene of \\"Manhunter\\") and \\"Ali\\" is certainly no exception. The film begins with a montage of Cassius Clay out running as part of his training for his first title fight with Sonny Liston mixed with images of formative influences on Clay growing up and Sam Cooke (David Elliott) performing in a Harlem nightclub. Unfortunately, the film never reaches this high initial peak again during the rest of the film.<br /><br />\\"Ali\\" is not a traditional biopic in that those who know little about the champ's life are not going to understand what is going on. The strategy of mouthing off at every opportunity to convince Liston that the young Cassius Clay was psychotic or the \\"rope a dope\\" tactic that Ali used to defeat George Foreman (Charles Shufford), are implicit at best. In this regard the film clearly works better with those who know enough of Ali's life to fill in the pieces (the scene where Ali ane Joe Frazier (James Toney) drive around in a car together planning their first fight was one of the film's few revelations for me). Mann creates something of a patterned mosaic, where there are fights, women, and interviews with Howard Cosell (Jon Voight), while Malcolm X (Mario Van Peebles) and Martin Luther King, Jr. are gunned down. What cuts through this is Ali's refusal to be drafted into the Army to go and fight in Vietnam. At the end of the film as Ali trains for the \\"Rumble in Jungle\\" his run through the streets of Zaire reprises the opening but the repetition rings hollow.<br /><br />There are scenes where Smith gets to spout off some of Ali's wonderful rants, but it is clearly established that this is not the \\"real\\" Ali. The moments in the film when we think we glimpse the real man are, paradoxically, not those in which he is talking but those in which he is quiet, his eyes taking in the world around him and leaving it to us to figure out what is going on in his mind. If there is any moment in the film where Ali is laid bared it is when he is punishing Ernie Terrell (Alfred Cole) for having called him Clay: Ali refuses to finish his opponent off, hitting Terrell again and again, repeatedly shouting \\"What's my name?\\"<br /><br />I also want to take Mann to task for having reduced the first fight with Frazier to the end of the fight, choosing to omit the shocking image of Ali on the canvas, wearing those shoes with the tassels. Especially since this is a film that takes the time to give the audience a sense in the final fight of how long Ali let Foreman pound on him against the ropes, waiting for the right moment. Fortunately, a lot of the film's faults are covered by Smith's performance, which has been deservedly praised for avoiding the pitfalls of caricature. Ali's legion of fans will enjoy this film more than others, but in the end \\"Ali\\" falls short of being as epic as the man himself.shed that this is not the \\"real\\" Ali.

068484267X|4.0|Angela's Ashes is one of the those rare books that can apply in almost any situation where poverty is involved. Forgive me if this seems a little strange because it's a memoir, but just hear me out. Poverty is around all of us every day and weather we like to admit it or not, everyone has had some sort of brush with it, whether it be seeing a homeless man on the street or having been poor at some point in your life. Mc Courts memories unlock a world which is usuallly locked out by what is considered the respectable world. Mc Court's childhood hard ships took place in Ireland, but there are simlar things happening to children now all over the world. His book alows you to slip in to the shoes of an impoversihed child struggling to survive, and when you finish you feel like you've been through the experience. Personally, this book made me want to learn how it's possible to help people in this kind of trouble. As well as making me feel lucky that I have what I have now.
B000089RVX|5.0|This is a great CD. I love the lyrics and I especially love song #4, My Immortal. My mom recorded the CD for my friend and she listened to it nonstop, until her brother took it so she needed another one. Amy Lee's voice is wonderful and strong, making this CD whole.
B00005JMXX|2.0|It definately was a movie made to make a point about something that people can only speculate over. The downside to that is that when people try to make a point about something most people do not believe in nor care about, it is the formula for a bad movie and this movie is no exception.<br /><br />This movie did so little to draw you in and keep your attention.  Yes it is based off of science fiction, but I did not feel the realness in anything they did.  When the Alien Ship was advancing on NYC in the movie ID4, you felt it.<br /><br />Anyway, this movie is horrible.  I do think it was a great concept as many of us like to see things destroyed. But the acting, script, and just the fact that they attempt to preach their tree-hugging views on me makes this a movie not to see.
B0001UL7RY|5.0|These are some great lyrics considering that she wrote them herself. And the music, it's ecxellent. I got \\"Under My Skin\\" a couple weeks ago, and I've beenlistening to it a lot. Even though I don't have Let Go, I still love Skater Boy, (or however you spell skater) and Complicated. I don't really understand how some people can't appreciate her work. But then again, there are singers that I don't like that other people do, and they'd probabably not understand why I don't appreciate their singing. <br />But anyways, I love Avril's music, but I wouldn't recomend it to just anyone. Just kidding.
B0002Y69NG|2.0|Now this is the ultimate collection for those people out there who still think that these films (at least the second and the third) are \\"intelligent\\" or \\"superior\\" or \\"philosophical\\". <br /> <br />At least they have the guts to include a commentary track this time. Not by the Wachowskis, though. No surprising move. I know, let's do a commentary track by \\"philosophers\\". Let them explain these \\"films\\". We can't. <br /> <br />The only saving grace are the other extras, I suppose. That's why I give this set two stars instead of the one I gave to the first DVD releases. <br /> <br />\\"Matrix Revisited\\", is it? Why didn't they revisit the script? Or the characters? Or the effects? Or the music?  <br /> <br />To all the people out there who haven't seen these fillums: don't let them fool you!
B00003CXCT|5.0|Finally that movies come to DVD.. Feel good to see the action and adventure again. Love to see all them back. It is big different with E1 and E2. Now finally we are been waiting for to see E3 what happened to their mother. Like when Luke asked Liea about mother. Can't wait to see E3 action. Anyway,why not to add original movie like two side of disc so that we can see what the different of original movies and special edition.. I know George Lucas want to change.. I watched that DVD movie is great and I cannot remember what is like be in original movie that how much it change with Digital pictures. I just hope that George should make two side of disc with original and special edition.

0790733900|4.0|I love that immortal line in this movie right at the beginning.<br /><br />Strother Martin as the short, evil, sadistic Chain Gang Captain drawls, \\"What we've here...is a failure to communicate.\\" Then he starts beating up the prisoners. There is a certain hilarious black humour about this unforgettable scene. Luke is named for his coolness when he wins a cool hand of poker and he sets the standard for all the would-be \\"Cool\\" heroes that have come after him. Perhaps only Sean Connery as James Bond 007 can match his never say die attitude against all odds. It always brings to mind my favourite song that dates from 1170 called \\"Die Gedanken sind frei\\". It means in German; your thoughts are always free so no matter what happens and what adversity you have to undergo, no one can get inside your head for your thoughts will always be free!

B00005JKGO|4.0|After hearing about this film for years I am happy to see it remastered and now on DVD. Indulge yourself in this basket of sweetness because the message Fellini conveys is significant. <br /> <br />This film was originally made in 1961 during a time when experimentation was the rage. The movie reflects all that life was during that decade and sadly shows that we haven't grown much as a society since we still fall for immediate gratification. The magnificent Marcello Mastroianni stars as \\"Marcello,\\" a successful tabloid reporter who finds himself revolving in and around high society in Rome. Within Marcello's heart lurks a deeper fervor, but that passion falls to the seduction of excess. His dream to seriously write gives way to the lure of wealth and fame. Marcello wanders around in dream like sequences where he encounters people of all sorts, all unhappy and drowning in overindulgence. Marcello is loved by Emma (Yvonne Furneaux) but it is a love that exists on the verge of an urgent madness and drives him away. He uses Maddalena (Anouk Aimee) as his divergence and becomes convinced that sex is as powerful as he feels love is confining, but Maddalena is empty and her attentions easily swayed. It is inevitable that Marcello falls for the great American moviestar, Sylvia (Anita Ekberg), while trying to rescue her from the paparazzi and her abusive moviestar boyfriend. In the end Marcello discovers his life to be shallow and insignificant and as ugly as a washed up sea creature only to find the appeal of life in the youthful vigor of a young girl's wave. <br /> <br />Fellini is a master at the art of filmmaking confirming the art of his mind with this complex yet extraordinary look at life. His vision can be confusing and even considered misleading if watched with a closed and shallow mind. Look for all the subtle nuances he leaves in his scenes such as the cleansing water of a fountain, the finality of a dead fish, and the gentle exuberant wave of youth. The actors inthis film are outstanding conveying a sense of boredom and fear as they go about their indulgences. The smiles and laughter of a drunk only hide a painful reality and Fellini captures the losses with an insightful ability. This film allows you to delve into your own shallow areas of life, the passionate ups and the despairing downs, but if you live right you can walk away smiling knowing that life is certainly sweeter once you learn from your mistakes.  <br />

B00006RINF|1.0|So I bought this cd, hearing all the hype about this band. I bought this cd instead of the new best of MArilyn Manson cd. God I hate myself for doing that. This band sounds like a nu-metal crap version of evanescense, not saying they are good either. The singer sounds like most other females in metal. The same operaatic \\"singing\\" voice. The backup singer is horrible. Again his voice reeks of nu-metallitis. She only has one tone to her voice, she doesnt have a versatile voice at all. Versatile e.g. danni filth. I listened to this cd once and is now stored in the back of my cd collection. I smashed the cd case over my head.

B0001I561E|5.0|Aladdin\\" continued Disney's hot streak of family friendly but witty animated classics that broke box office records. Unfortunately, the magic was to last for a couple more movies. No small part of the success of \\"Aladddin\\" can be attributed to the songwriting team of Alan Menken and Howard Ashman. Menken and Ashman (who also wrote the winning songs for \\"Beauty and The Beast\\" and \\"Little Shop of Horrors\\"). Also, the witty self assured direction, like that of \\"Beauty and The Beast\\", helped define a hip, new Disney that had something for everyone.<br /><br />So what's the difference between the \\"Special Editon\\" and the \\"Special Edition Gift Set\\". Plenty but as to whether it's worth the extra cost depends on how much of a fan you are of the film. The \\"Special Edition\\" comes only with the DVDs (the featurettes and documentaries are discussed below). The \\"Special Edition Gift Set\\" comes with all that plus six original illustrations on heavy stock of characters from the film. You also get a deluxe book that's housed in a slipcase. It's very nice, indeed. Now, if I were Disney I also would have included the soundtrack and also made this edition a numbered, limited edition. While it might grow in value until the next generation of disc players come out and this is re-released yet again for Blu-Ray discs, it would have been better for fans to do a limited numbered edition. Oh, and I forgot the film frame from the original movie.<br /><br />\\"Aladdin\\" looks great on DVD with sharp, clear images and bright, vivid colors. I didn't detect any analog or digital blemishes worth noting. The Disc looks even better than the laserdisc version issued nearly a decade ago and worlds better than the VHS with crisper, clearer sound and a much cleaner more vivid (and colorful)picture. The \\"Disney Enhanced\\" 5.1 soundtrack actually improves the dialogue and songs giving them better clarity and added presence.<br /><br />The extras are a mixed bag but most of them are well worth having. There's deleted scenes presented in rough pencil animation, deleted songs highlighted by the terrific \\"Proud of Your Boy\\". Clay Aiken sings a version of the song for a music video. We also get \\"A Whole New World\\" performed by the dipsy duo of Nick Lachey and Jessica Simpson. The two hour \\"A Diamond in the Rough\\" is a fascinating glimpse behind-the-scenes of this marvelous movie. We also get to see scenes from the deleted storyline for the film. Pop-up trivia facts can also be programmed to play on the DVD player as well. The two audio commentary tracks feature the directors and producer of the film while the second has some very funny commentary from the various character animators involved in the film.<br /><br />\\"Aladdin's Magic Carpet Ride\\" is the best of the extras included here. It's actually not a game per se but a magic carpet ride that's best experienced on as big a TV as possible with the lights out. It's as close to a thrill ride ever presented on home video. \\"Inside the Genie's Lamb\\" is a mildly interesting and entertaining glimpse into the Genie's habitat. We also get \\"Genie World Tour\\". This bit of whimsy is fun and Disney directors actually entertained the notion of putting it on during the end credits at one time. It's clever and a witty short. \\"3 Wishes Game\\" might keep little ones entertained once or twice although some little ones will need help operating the DVD remote to play the game. Parents stay close by so the kids don't throw the remote at the TV in frustration. You can also select your favorite \\"Aladdin\\" songs with onscreen lyrics to help you sing along (God save your neighbors if you're a bad singer).<br /><br />All in all a terrific package well worth picking up. \\"Aladdin\\" is a funny, charming and entertaining movie with the Disney team at their peak. The \\"Special Gift Edition\\" is truly for the hardcore Disney fan that collects everything Disney. The two disc \\"Special Edition\\" is more for the casual fan or those that love the movie but just don'tcollect Disney stuff. I had some reservations about the DVD release as I was afraid they might screw it up but they didn't. The only thing missing is a discussion about the original song lyrics that were changed for home video release due to concerns about their anti-Arab sentiments. Also, we don't get any new footage of Robin Williams but we do see some vintage stuff from his very funny recording sessions.but just don't collect Disney stuff.

B0000024ZC|5.0|It is an absolute travesty and total disservice to the progressive rock listening community out there that none of the current record giants or moguls, with all the money they've amassed over the years, cannot pick up the rights to the UK's old Vertigo and Chrysalis L.P. labels and remaster Gentle Giant's catalogue. The band's music is so historically critical to modern prog bands such as the Flower Kings, Transatlantic, Neal Morse and his former band mates! These bands continually pay written and musical tribute to this talented and extremely experimental 70's band. The first four GG L.P.'s from their extensive catalogue are absolute masterpieces of progressive, avante-garde, experimental music. Why are we, the listening public, left to suffer only second-rate, poor quality audience recordings produced by the remaining bandmates? GG deserves better, and so do we! What is the problem, people?
6305428050|5.0|As a kid growing up in the 80's I was blessed to have the most obnoxious and lame movies to be ever produced, stories that went in the way of the unnexpected and funny turn outs.  This movie Aventures in Babysitting was one of those.  How do you explain such a clever done movie, with classical scenes, like the HOOK, or the hanging in the BUILDING, or singin' the BLUES, or even the geeky girlfriend without the glasses, and well she only wanted a hot dog, but the check was not good.  This is going to be a funny movie that will always bring me back to my childhood.  Amazing...hey an who knew Shue will portrait such serious parts after... *****FIVE STARS.
068987474X|5.0|Loved this book for the humor, the encouragement, the compliments.  But it left me feeling a little lacking, mostly because it didn't really explain HOW to set limits on jerky, immature guys (besides ignoring them).  It did give the very needed WHY, which is something you don't find in a lot of books, and I appreciate Greg and Liz for writing the book.  I did however, read another book, titled Boundaries: When to Say Yes/When to Say No to Take Control of Your Life.  That gave me the HOW, in knowing what to say, how to say it, when to say it and why to say it... to all kinds of people, not just jerky, immature guys.  So, the two books hand in hand is a great combo.
B00005JMEW|5.0|.<br />This is a fast paced thriller filled with wicked battles, and is not for children, nor for all adults.  It is loaded with violence, bloodshed, revenge, and gory action sequences.  If this is not something you tolerate, then you will hate the film.  However, if you can accept this brutality and have never seen Kill Bill Volume 1, be sure to also purchase Volume 2 at the same time.<br /><br />The sword dances are simply amazing, reminding me of the skills used in \\"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon.\\"  Flashbacks to the opening scene are a dominant and driving force during both volumes.  The theme song lyrics are associated with characters, plot, action, emotions, determination, and strength.  Now I find the notes, the melody, the words wander through my mind no matter what I do, and I want to see the film again.<br /><br />Quentin Tarantino's use of non-sequential progression is perfect... it worked in \\"Pulp Fiction\\" and it works in \\"Kill Bill.\\"  His films now fall into my classic \\"Viki's Chick Flicks\\" category.  The action and violence show me a side of humanity that I hope to never see up close and personal, but I understand it better.<br /><br />The history of Lucy Liu's character O-Ren Ishii is revealed through Tarantino's surprising use of animation, and it succeeds.  She is the only character whose background is revealed.  I was startled to see this animated sequence.  However, the gross violence and other information that reveal what twisted this assassin are strong as it creates verisimilitude for the complex killer, and makes the film formidable.  Though none of the other assassins have their background revealed, it is reasonable to assume that they also have been through such experiences to drive them into their careers.<br /><br />Tarantino ends this flick with a far more emotional connection than I've seen in his previous works.  I found it fascinating that QT used aspects of the classic spaghetti western, the amazing sword frenzy shown through back lighting similar to scenes in \\"Flash Dance,\\" and other surrealistic filming techniques.<br /><br />I found a few discrepancies in the films, but this is still five stars for a \\"Viki's Chick Flick.\\"<br /><br />Victoria Tarranish Dance,\\" and other surrealistic filming techniques.    I found a few discrepancies in the films, but this is still five stars for a \\"Viki's Chick Flick.\\"     Victoria Tarrani
B000268QB2|5.0|This is such a beautiful album. Everytime I listen to it, I feel as if I've just woken to a whole new day... uplifting music!
B00005JNEI|4.0|Firstly, I am not from the US.  It seems to have become a hobby of Americans to wear their politics rather vocally on their sleeves. Looking up info about his film, if you're any kind of regular net-surfer, you will likely have seen verbal volleys directed back and forth between democratic supporters and republican supporters.  What ends up happening is the equivalent of an elementary school name-calling contest rather than any discussion of the film as is.  Yes, there are parts of this movie presented out of context.  One example:  When the Taliban visit Texas in this film, they were there by invitation from the Clinton administration, even though Bush is Texas governor.  However, what works in this film is seeing a result of one presidential administration's decisions (and indecisions in one almost tragically comical scene) and its effects on people in two countries.  The interspersal of Lila Lipscomb's patriotism to outrage to utter sadness are the most moving parts of this film.  Seeing the effects of the war on those who were on the front lines and discovering what is never mentioned on US newscasts is a powerful series of images.  The interviews with shell-shocked, amputee soldiers in rehab are frightening to behold, knowing that there are what is nearing 10,000 of these men returning to the USA, and to what kind of reception?  Seeing Moore on the streets of DC telling members of congress to sign their adult children up for military service is hilarious to watch, especially seeing the reactions of the congressmen.   <br /> <br />For me, all of these changes in mood, from disbelief, to horror, to unbounded laughter are what make this a 4 star film.  Taking it in context of just a theater goer, and not a potential voter, make me agree with why this film won the Palm d'Or at the Cannes Festival.  There are powerful messages here, despite personal politics and should be seen by anyone who is a citizen of this planet, not just the US.
B00005RIXP|4.0|With the possible exception of the Carvaradossi, this is an exceptional cast and an exceptional Tosca overall.  John Shaw's Scarpia is lasciviously rich-voiced, his mobile expressive face tiptoe-ing near campy at times but staying on the right side of the line.  Terrific.  Ms. Marton uses her splendid emotion-telegraphing vocal resources to wonderful effect.  Mario (Lamberto Furlan) is vocally not in these leagues with a smallish voice, sometimes sharpish edge and effortful singing, but he does not spoil the proceedings.  The production is a good standard Tosca, no surprises, but who needs them for this masterpiece?<br /><br />Lots of fun here (I say fun, because this melodrama is so juicy and done with such Puccinian genius it makes me smile continuously when it is done well as this is.)<br /><br />I bought this for Eva Marton, but happily there is much much more here that is memorable.  My all-time favorite Scarpia is Ruggerio Raimondi in the \\"live\\" Tosca with Domingo and Malfitano, but John Shaw made me watch his Scarpia with equal enjoyment.  Different, less deeply oily and satanic, but terrific.
B00005JMAH|5.0|Don't pay attention to all the overgrown HP fanatic children who are too old to be devoted to a series of books that aren't targeted towards their age group. <br /> <br />The Harry Potter books aren't my kind of reading, I read to learn, be challenged, be entertained and look smart so girls come on to me (that last part's a joke for those who can't sense sarcasm in print).  So since I don't have my own imagination invested in the books I'm able to accept the director's vision of how the film should look. <br /> <br />Bottomline, it's a beautiful film with more character development than the previous two had combined.  Harry, Hermione and Ron have all grown to be quality actors who know their characters well and seem to become even more believeable with each addition to the franchise.  The look of the film is darker, the set design is more ambitious than the clausterphobic prequels, Harry Potter's world is blown up and for once we actually get to see him suffer some real psychological anguish. <br /> <br />Can't wait for the next chapter, I only hope in the future Terry Gilliam decides to forget about the franchising and make what would probably be the best film in the series, that's just wishful thinking of course.
B00005JNEI|4.0|I saw Michael Moore's Fahrenheit 9/11 and I thought it was a pretty good movie.  Did he take things out of context?  Maybe.  Did he edit his movie so that it looked to be saying one thing?  Sure.  But did he lie?  No.  Tha facts were accurate, and that is really what the sad thing is. <br /> <br />This movie did what the purpose was.  To get people talking.  To get people thinking.  Of course, it is controversial.  But it was suppose to be!!   <br /> <br />Hopefully more people can see this movie.  It was well made and deserving of all the acclaim that is has gotten.  Would I call it a GREAT movie?  No.  But it was one that had me see a different side of Government.   <br /> <br />
0804106304|2.0|I'm probably the only person in the world that feels this way, but I was not impressed with this book.  Despite the stories being interrelated, they felt disjoined and random.  There was no central plot that I could find to make the book a success in my mind.
B0002VKZL6|4.0|I have always enjoyed Mark Knopfler's mix of ingenious music and history based story songs.  This album probably leans too strongly to the narrative side for most listeners' tastes but I thoroughly enjoy repeated listenings and the insight which comes from getting to know the characters which populate his songs.  \\"5:15 a.m.\\" is my current favorite.  It combines a melancholy sound with a compelling story.  \\"Boom, Like That\\", \\"Song for Sonny Liston\\" and \\"Postcards from Paraguay\\" are tracks I also enjoy.  I am sure I will come to appreciate many of the other tracks as I listen over time but I must say that 4 or 5 of them are destined to be victims of the \\"next track\\" button more often than not.  That's okay with me.  Any time I can find a CD with a half-dozen intriguing songs, I'm satisfied. The first editorial review here at Amazon calls this Knopfler's \\"most rocking\\" since Dire Straits.  Way off on that assessment.  Even Ragpicker's dream has more to get your toe tapping.  That said, I have never been disappointed by anything Mark Knopfler released, but then even \\"Notting Hillbillies\\"  suits my taste.
B0002Y4TZG|5.0|When my neighbor came back from a London Christmas vacation in December of '79, I eagerly anticipated a box full of the latest punk rawk from the scene.  I was presented with just London Calling.  \\"The rest is dead bones rattling in a coffin.  THIS album is the one that will never be forgotten.\\" <br /> <br />My neighbor was right. <br /> <br />The rerelease is worthy of investment, not just for the interesting DVD that comes along with it (Westway to the World is  the essential movie on the Clash), nor for the marginally interesting \\"vanilla tapes\\" cd (very low-fi rehearsals for many of the songs that would become LC).  The rerelease of London Calling is worthy of the investment because of the remastering.  The full range of instruments used comes out of the background and take their proper place in the mix. <br /> <br />If you were into punk back in the day, you'll remember what this album meant to us.  If you haven't listened to it in a while, get this and be amazed at what we missed on vinyl back then.  If you've never heard the Clash, this is THE place to start.  Not a bad song on the bugger.
0393035158|5.0|[I posted this review once before, but it seems even more appropriate now.] <br />It is a measure of a good book that it generates so much controversy. I suppose it is also the measure of a good book that its detractors are generally imbeciles. To read the negative reviews of The End of Faith is to see its thesis confirmed, over and over again. You have the relgious nuts who can't deal with Harris' argument at all; you have the athiest nuts who can't deal with his very reasonable endorsement of spiritual experience; and then you just have the people who can't read, who raise challenges which Harris deals with very effectively in his book. If there is fault to find with The End of Faith, it is probably that Harris has given his readers too much credit. There is too little hand-holding and too much truth.
B00003CXCT|2.0|OK, so Lucas decided to dub in Hayden Christensen in Episode VI as Vader's \\"ghost\\" (wearing the world's worst fake beard). Lucas wants to make his \\"vision\\" conform. Fine, then how about going back to Episodes IV - VI and making Vader about three inches shorter so he more accurately resembles the comparatively tiny Christensen?
B00000099Y|1.0|Tool is a band that I am NOT new to and that said, I have never thought much of them. However, I am new to the notion that they represent some kind of evolution in music or their music being \\"mind and body altering\\". Who comes up with this crap? Being familiar with dark industrial music, I was very skeptical on borrowing a friends copy of this album. Then upon listening to it, I was actually ROOTING for them! Rooting for them to impress me with something or anything. I also did what some here have suggested and listened to the album several times to let the so-called \\"cumulative effect wash me over\\". So heeding that advice, I took Enema on some long road trips and...nothing..., much.     This is a band that only exists in moments. They make no attempts to establish moods which are worth exploring. They just drop it and move on to something else, as if there is a short attention span issue with the band members. This is really weird considering how mindnumbingly long many of these songs are (or seem to be-the ones that are 6mins or less). And I have no problem with long tunes that take awhile to establish their mood, and letting the listener groove on that. The problem is Tool doesn't do this, and if they do, they inevitably settle on what amounts to nothing more than some lame standard issue riffing (ie- \\"eulogy\\").  The one instance where they DO achieve and establish a groove, they only succeed in annoyingly beating it into the ground(ie- \\"46 and 2\\").     For what its worth, however, the album does have its moments. \\"Jimmy\\" sports a nifty, double bass drum flourish, near the end, which is pretty cool. And before it settles into its juvenile subject matter (so much so, I couldn't believe it!!)whiny wailing, \\"hooker with a (...)\\" builds with a cool Page Hamilton style arrangement.     Kids, listen to Godflesh. Get a lesson in what crushing, monolithic music is. It stomps a muddy army boot into what this is.
B00005JNEI|5.0|This film highlights the many flaws and horrible mistakes of all the Bush people. Thanks Mike!
0767827902|5.0|The silent voices of the golden masters of the american literature (Dos Passos , Sinclair Lewis , Nathaniel Hwathorne and William Faulkner) seem to emerge as dark and invisible ghosts in this poignant and supreme jewel film .<br /><br />The dazzling direction of Bodganovich and his golden touch as atmosphere creator is simply admirable and breathtaking.<br /><br />A golden issue in the american cinema .
0784010501|5.0|Ok, I have to be honest...I love this movie. It is beautifully shot and directed. The colors and the black and white are beautifully balanced. It is totally fun to watch. Even if you dont like the woman, the end product is very enjoyable. You have to remember, at this particular time in pop culture, the early 90's, Madonna did indeed rule. She had really come into her own as an icon and a great star. The artiface of the 80's was something I really enjoyed as a teen. But as I became an adult, it was always interesting to watch her. Ok, so maybe she really wasnt the best actress. But at that time she was the one star that was able to turn all that plastic into something really worth paying attention to. And this film showed her at her finest. Even if you didnt like her, you couldnt help but pay attention to her. Watching this movie now makes me yearn for those days. She really was the last \\"great star\\". We dont have stars like that anymore. Even Spears cant obtain that grandure. That white hot heat of celebrity. She really had it then more so then any other famous person on the planet. Of course, it has faded. Madonna now seems like King Kong. So watching this film now takes you back to a time when stars were still really \\"STARS\\". She really has become the last \\"Elvis, Beatles, Monroe, Dean, Taylor\\". And we do need that. Try to think of a star that has had that much attention in the last ten years. Julia? Gwyneth? Not one. She really is the last great star, and this film shows her at her peak. No one seems to give her that. It is at once fascinating and irritating. You want to know more, yet you feel you've seen too much. She has never been so honest and so vacuous on film before or since.  It is a documentary of a modern star at her peak. It's a glimpse of the American dream. It's a peak at a life very few of us will ever see... Now, how many of those do you see every day? This is a great rock film. It is sublime. It sets the bar for every female entertainer after her. This film is Madonna at her peak, her best, her pinnacle. It is \\"the\\" Madonna film. I couldnt suggest it more...
B0002ZYE1Y|5.0|Ok, so I have been a nightwish fan for some time now, and I currently own all of their albums. This one mixes both heavy(more then there other albums) with the beauty of tarja's singing. Like others have said, if you have not heard nightwish before, and are a new listener, don't get this album first. I would suggest going with Wishmaster or even Angels Fall First. Back on subject, I enjoy pretty much every song on this album, with the exception of Romanticide. Some songs that stand out are, Dark Chest of Wonders, Nemo, Planet Hell, and Ghost Love Score. I do not know where they were going with Wish I Had An Angel(the whole techno part was a little confusing), but seeing them live makes them even that much better.If you are a fan of Nightwish, I would suggest you pick up this album, and if possible, see them live, cause they are so much better live. Oh yes, my one disappointment. I am disappointed taht the US release was under Road Runner Records, because I dont think they fit in with the whole Nu Metal scene at all. But its ok, because we got the album here, and that is all that matters. Definate Solid 5 for me, along with all of there other cds :D
6304806418|2.0|It's not a \\"bad\\" movie. But... it does have it's problems. It's like a really great classic car that you \\"thought\\" had all the kinks worked out. I think Madonna actually did a fine job considering the fact that she had to play someone so young and then so sick. Ok, both might have been \\"stretches\\". But... she pulls it off, of course, it's the role of a lifetime; which is always interesting to see. And her voice sounds fantastic. She brought a \\"pop\\" sensibility to the part. She made it modern. Whatever with Lupone. We saw that on Broadway already honey... And Antonio, his performance is great. You can tell he is just so happy to be in this production. Pryce, however, I just dont get. Whatever with that casting... Can't win em all. It looks great, but then the motor starts to give out. Plus, I think this would have been a great opportunity for some real acting to take place. There is NO talking. EVERYTHING is done in song. It ruins the movie. BAD MOVE!!! BAD! BAD! BAD! There are so many fantastic emotional moments that... Im sorry, are just destroyed with singing. The production is so huge, the talent so plentifull, locations so amazing, costumes so fine and beautifull... it's a shame. Why did this have to become a music video? And not a chance for Madonna and the rest of the cast to do some real acting?  This could have been a great epic. Coulda, woulda shoulda...
B00004XONN|1.0|If you like radiohead your stupid. Lol. You are probably some really dumb boso college student who trys to act rebbellious and just listens to radiohead for the hell of it. Dont get this... this is their worst album which is just sad. Radiohead stinks!
B000002GVO|4.0|One of those special albums where the album tracks are equally as good, if not better, than the lifted singles. This classic album is considered the Eagles best. While that is quite true, reviewers should also check out the preceding album \\"One of those nights\\" which is on equal par. Listening to Hotel California nearly 30 years on, the album still holds up extremely well. I may be the only person who never really liked the title track, but you cannot argue that it is a well-crafted song. However, to me, the real gems lie in the excellent album tracks. Forgot the quite dull \\"New Kid in town\\" which suffered from radio overkill (I  fast-forward this track), go straight to \\"Wasted Time\\". This particular track to me is the album's highlight. Simply beautiful, and gives me goosebumps every time. Don Henley on vocals makes this song so special. Other highlights include the stunning \\"Pretty Maids all in a row\\" with its wonderful fade-in. One of Joe Walsh's very best songs, alongside \\"Life's been good\\". The album finishes on a fine note with the epic \\"The last resort\\". This track has many layers, and is acclaimed for this structure. Add Don Henley's great voice, and you have one classic song. <br /> <br />Despite the shortfalls, \\"Hotel California\\" remains one of the must-own albums of the 70's ... in fact, all-time. <br />
B0000TB050|5.0|There is a moment in this film that never fails to give me chills: The segue between\\"All I want is you\\"to \\"Where the Streets Have No Name\\"in which Bono holds the last note of\\"All I want...\\" in such a way that you feel as if he pouring out his soul at that moment.....and then in a great catharsis the band delivers a stunning performance of \\"Where......\\"It is for me the best moment I have seen in a concert! I strongly recommend this dvd..the entire concert is filled with the best rock you will ever hear(I am 51...I have heard my share of\\"the rock and roll\\")!
6305428042|5.0|This is a great classical film that should be a standard view during October.  The movie is a horror / comedy.  As such kids can get frightened but the good guys win in the end and they with humourous results.  This film has some classic one liners.  I'm not going to spoil the fun but you should definitely pick up this film. <br /> <br />Enjoy: <br /> <br />David
B00005JNEI|3.0|Moore's film, while funny and intertaining, should not be called a DOCUMENTARY. I am sorry to break it to everyone, but this film was so slanted it was teetering on fiction. Facts, soundbites and footage were arranged with dramatic flair to wage war on Moore's sworn enemy--George W Bush and our government's policies. It's great we live in a country that someone can make millions bashing the government that is actually fighting for that very RIGHT. I applaud Michael Moore for his guts and creativity but I believe <br />he has irresponsibly taken advantage of the public's Hollywood-induced gullibility; in an effort to weaken this country's already questionable solidarity. With this movie's fiscal success, Michael Moore can REALLY afford to hate this country. Unfortunately the rest of us can not.
B00005JNEI|5.0|I found myself crying almost immediately after the film began.  As it rehashed the Gore-Bush debacle of the 2000 election, I felt tears running down my face.  I hadn't realized how deeply affected I was by that whole mess.  The death and destruction wrought by that one Supreme Court decision is a bit overwhelming.  After viewing the entire film and finding myself crying on more than one occasion, I have to say that every single American should see this film.  The movie opened my eyes.  Excellent film.
B0002OERI0|2.0|Green day fall flat on their faces with American Idiot and prove that they're nothing more than a one trick pony (Dookie). Billy Joe trying to deliver anti-imperialist songs is like Adam Sandler doing Shakespeare. Green day fans will have nothing to complain about but for non-fans, don't beleive the hype.
B00004BZ0N|5.0|The Clash never really were a punk band, they just exploded on the punk scene with their awesome first album. It took their under-rated second album before they found their true voice on this, one of the most complete albums ever, a collage of everything that made the heart of late 1970s London beat.  <br /> <br />The Clash were easily the most stylish and compulsive live band around at the time, and this album just about does them justice. This is as good as it gets.
B00005JMX6|4.0|THE GIRL NEXT DOOR, Luke Greenfield's sexy yet sweet teen angst flick, owes a lot to both the RISKY BUSINESS premise (HS Senior, his goal a prestigious college, has his life turned 'upside-down' by world-wise 'Pro'), and the internal structure of John Hughes' 80's teen 'classics' (geeky hero, and his two geekier friends, gain acceptance and prestige through his relationship with a 'dream girl').<br /><br />Close your eyes, and you could easily picture the young Anthony Michael Hall or John Cusack filling Emile Hirsch's role, with Rebecca De Mornay or Kelly Preston replacing Elisha Cuthbert as his ex-porn star girlfriend. THE GIRL NEXT DOOR, however, actually works quite well on it's own merits, thanks to Greenfield's 'tongue-in-cheek' approach to the naughtiness, and a flawless supporting cast, particularly Timothy Olyphant as a likable but ultimately ruthless porn producer, and Timothy Bottoms and Donna Bullock, as Hirsch's clueless but blindly supportive parents.<br /><br />Emile Hirsch shows a propensity towards 'soulfully earnest' expressions, but does provide one of the film's funniest scenes, as, while high on Ecstasy, he attempts to navigate through a crowd awaiting his speech on 'high moral fiber'. While some critics tended to brush off Elisha Cuthbert's performance as just another skin-baring 'boy toy' variation, she actually conveys the vulnerability and pain of her character's past quite effectively, balancing it with sly humor and a LOT of 'sex appeal', done within the restraints of her \\"No Nudity\\" contract clause...Sorry, guys, while you'll see a LOT of her skin, you AREN'T going to see Elisha 'bare all'...<br /><br />The film is a very funny, breezy lark, and while it never achieves the heights of insanity of RISKY BUSINESS, it certainly stands as one of the better 'teen' comedies of the past few years!
B0002VK66U|5.0|Thanks to Wounded Bird Records for finally putting this album out on cd.This an excellent melodic hard rock album from 1985. Joe released this solo cd between his stints as lead singer of Rainbow and Yngwie Malmstein. The hit single from the fall of 1985,ENDLESSLY is an excellent power ballad. Turner had a great backing band on this album featuring Bobby Messano on guitars and bass,Chuck Burgi on drums,and Al Greenwood of Foreigner fame on keyboards.Greenwood also co wrote most of the songs with Turner. This cd was produced by the famous record producer Roy Thomas Baker who has produced Queen,The Cars,Journey,Ron Wood,and many more.
0465043550|3.0|Its a somewhat peripheral matter from the point of view of Mandelbrot/Hudson's over-all argument, but one that annoys me: they join the campaign against the FASB's perfectly sensible reform, and give only the most spurious of reasons for that. <br /> <br />During the dotcom boom, many of the most speculative of companies used stock options as a key form of compensation.  One of the cool things about this, from their point of view, was that they didn't have to treat the options as an expense on their books, so that as far as real or prospective investors were concerned, they were buying that much labor for nothing.  <br /> <br />The FASB, sensibly, wants to crack down on this. An economy of monopoly money isn't good, as we should have learned since 2000.  <br /> <br />But the CEO of Intel, predictably, doesn't want to go along, and complains that the best anyone can do with the expensing of options is to come up with a fizzy approximate \\"kind of right\\" figure, so they shouldn't have to come up with any figure. The authors quote that statement, and seem to endorse it.  <br /> <br />It is nonsense.  The effective figure Mr. Barrett and others are using now is ... zero.  Yes, Black-Scholes or any other proposed method will be imperfect but zero is demonstrably wrong.  If the worth of an options grant was zero, it wouldn't be useful in hiring or retaining anybody. People don't work for zero.  <br /> <br />One doesn't need to wear the Mandelbrot set on one's tee shirt to see that the FASB has common sense on its side on this one.  <br /> <br />Otherwise, though, there is much of value in this mixed-bag of a book, and I'm giving it three stars.
B0002858YS|3.0|The Strokes pioneered it, and recently Franz Ferdinand & others are taking a stab at it; retro, garage rock with staticy vocals. The Killers are actually pretty good at it, and their album Hot Fuss is very good. While they aren't the Strokes, they have proven to be able to create a catchy single that gathers a great deal of interest in the record, in this case it is \\"Somebody told Me\\". Elsewhere on the album they pull off the formula approx. 75% of the time, especially on highlights like \\"Jenny was a Friend of Mine\\" & \\"Smile Like you Mean It\\". My personal favorite track was \\"Change Your Mind\\". While they won't be contenders for album of the year this year, there is a good chance they may be battling it out in the future.
B0002F6BRE|5.0|This movie was one of the best Christmas movies I have seen in a long time.  I would rate it right up there with Jim Carrey's Grinch.  Will Ferrell was the perfect choice for the Elf and of course Bob Newhart is a classic.
B000000W6F|5.0|Gish is one of those rare, amazing debuts from a band. One of a few landmark grunge albums to be released in 1991, this one has the least coverage. Released a month before Nirvana's Nevermind, this is the last grunge album to be released when grunge was still an underground phenomenon. And what a great disc to end the period with.<br />Musically, this is where the roots of everything SP would cover lie. From hard rocking &quot;Siva&quot;, to dreamy acoustic guitars (the underated &quot;Crush&quot;). And the melodic mid-tempo numbers &quot;Snail&quot;. Though all the songs are of very good quality, these three are the standouts, along with (of course) &quot;Rhinoceros&quot;. Also good is the psychedelic &quot;Window Paine&quot; and the nice ender &quot;Daydream&quot; sung by D'Arcy.<br />Lyrically, Corgan is taking his babysteps here. Though some of Corgan's catchiest lyrics are found on here. Please don't tell me that after listening to Rhinoceros, you haven't found yourself singing &quot;and she knows, she knows, she knows.&quot; to yourself! <br />This album is not Smashing Pumpkins' best, but it is an amazing debut without a doubt. This is for sure one of the best grunge albums of the time. It might take some time to get into this album, but once you get hooked on one song, without a doubt you'll get hooked by the rest.
B0002WYS6S|5.0|I ordered the new DT weeks ago and spend the last few days basically waiting by the mail box. It arrived yesterday and then everything went on hold so I could watch the concert in it's entirety. And was it worth the wait? You bet. It's all I expected and then some. All the band members are in super form and there is simple not another band in the world that contains such a wealth of musical talent. Guitar, drums, keys and bass are all just jawdroppingly amazing and James never sung better. In the past he sometimes struggled with the higher notes and tended to scream rather than sing. No such problems here. If loud or with feeling, he is spot on. Song selection is superb. Some people might miss the odd track, but considering how many great songs they have, the concert should be 8 hours long to cover only the greatest of them all. Highlights? Everything from minute 1 to minute 172 and I am overwhelmed with the inclusion of my favorite DT song \\"trial of tears\\".  <br />Visually they've done a world class job. Lighting is not over the top, the band always clear to see and the mix is the best I've ever seen on a concert DVD with the cameras always picking up the soloists without ignoring the others. Sound is also great apart from that glitch in \\"new millenium\\". Some may complain about the crowd noise being too loud as they did with \\"Rush in Rio\\", but believe me, it is just perfect.  <br />Enough said. No go and get your copy, if you havn't already done it. This is a must have for everyone who likes to see and hear music played to perfection.
B000002AVF|5.0|This is a WONDERFUL album.  One of the best EVER made in recording history.  Mariah shows us her many talents here, from her powerful, many octave voice, to her songwriting talents.  Also, her producing abilities.  Mariah is the ULTIMATE entertainer.  Younger artist such as Britney Spears, Mandy Moore, among others dream they could reach her level; they should NEVER be compared to her.  Here's a breakdown of each song:<br /><br />FANTASY-5/5- Awesome song all around.  The beat, the lyrics, the voice.  No wonder it was #1.<br /><br />UNDERNEATH THE STARS-5/5-This is a great song.  I believe that if it would have been a single, it would have been a smash.  If you are lucky, you can find this song as a maxi-single.  Though never officially released as a single.<br /><br />ONE SWEET DAY-5/5-This is a WONDERFUL song for anyone who has lost a loved one.  I love the vocals.  Such a powerful meaning.  Boyz ll Men are the perfect addition to join MC.  What else can I say...#1 hit for MC.<br /><br />OPEN ARMS-5/5-So much better than the original.  Journey's edition was awful; MC turned a bad song vocally, into a brilliant song.  She will blow you away with her octaves here.  Such a beautiful song.<br /><br />ALWAYS BE MY BABY-5/5-I love this song.  JD helps here.  The two of them are great together.  This is a great song after you have broken up with someone.  No wonder it went to #1.<br /><br />I AM FREE-4/5- A good song, not one of my favorites.  Good lyrics as normal.<br /><br />WHEN I SAW YOU-5/5-This is my favorite song on here.  I love the lyrics.  This should have been a single.  This song is amazing.<br /><br />LONG AGO-5/5- I love the beat to this song.  This is a great song, shows MC's R&B talents.  Much different than the other songs.<br /><br />MELT AWAY-5/5- This is my 2nd favorite song.  I love the music and the lyrics.  MC's mega-voice is on key on every note.  Many people can relate to this song.<br /><br />FOREVER-4/5-I like this song.  Not a favorite.  MC's voice is great and lyrically and musically it is great.  It never was a single, but it did become an air-play hit, so why didn't Columbia release this as a single?<br /><br />DAYDREAM INTERLUDE-5/5- This makes you wanna jump up and dance.  Great music.<br /><br />LOOKING IN-5/5- Awesome song.  Great lyrics.  This is a personal song for MC and it is a good song.<br /><br />OVERALL, this is a MUST HAVE for any one who appreciates music.  If you are a true MC fan, you have this album already.  Back when it was released in October 1995, it broke records.  \\"Fantasy\\" debuted at #1 on the Billboard Hot 100 Singles chart, and stayed there for 8 weeks.  Two weeks later, the album debuted at #1 on the Billboard Album Charts, a feat never accomplish by a female singer before.  The second single was \\"One Sweet Day\\", this was a record-breaking single.  It debuted at #1 on the Hot 100 Singles Chart and stayed there for 16 weeks.  The single itself has sold over 2.3 million copies since its release.  \\"Always Be My Baby\\" the third single, was also #1 on the Hot 100 Singles Chart for 2 weeks.  The album itself has sold over 20 millions copies worldwide.  This is such a GREAT album, you must add this to your collection.  YOU WILL LOVE IT!!!!it is great.

B0002S94OS|5.0|This maybe a somewhat biased oppinion since Lamb Of God is my favorite band but if you like metal and havent heard of LOG your missing out on some hot (...). I completely agree with the others when they say the sound is crystal clear, New American gospel was kinda tuff to tell which guitarists were playin what, ATPB was alot more clear but Ashes of the Wake is crystal clear. Each album is truly different one after the other and the lyrics, wow. I HIGHLY recommend Ashes of the Wake and NAG and ATPB u will NOT be disappointed if ur a metal head.
B000002JNN|5.0|AC/DC can open an album better than any band in history. Think of the opening tracks on \\"Back in Black\\", \\"For Those About to Rock\\" and \\"Highway to Hell\\". The first song on each of those disks prepares the listener for what is coming and really sets the mood for the album. \\"The Razors Edge\\" opening \\"Thunderstruck\\" is no exception. The slow build with Brian Johnson's growling vocals lets you know you are in for another fun ride with AC/DC. The music as a whole on \\"The Razors Edge\\" is really just your typical AC/DC bluesy, corner bar rock that the band has the patent on. And that is a good thing. Throughout the years AC/DC has remained constant with their music. Through disco, new age, hair-metal, grunge,rap & nu-metal AC/DC has stuck to what they do best, simple guitar rock. And \\"Razors Edge\\" features some of their best songs \\"For the Money\\", \\"Mistress for Christmas\\", \\"Are You Ready\\" and the title track are pure AC/DC. If you are a fan of the band then you should own this disk, if not.......hell, pick it up anyway. There is no better away to drive away the blues of a long day at work, or a fight with the wife than by cranking a little AC/DC.
B00005JNEI|5.0|This is an extraordinary, powerful, and well thought out movie.  It is harsh on the Bush administration and their failures.  But more importantly... it is ALL documented.  You will hear a ton of BAD things about this movie from the extremely political people out there.  Facts are hard to dispute, so a spin campaign is in full force.  Michael Moore anticipated this and had complete documentation of his sources available for your own research.  Go to [...] / and check the sources to verify the accuracy of this movie before you listen to any of the negative propaganda against it.  So I emplore you, DO NOT BELIEVE EVERYTHING YOU HEAR... check it out for yourself and be intelligently informed.  This movie is a MASTERPIECE!!!
0142000663|2.0|This book is incredibly boring. This review is coming from a teens point-of-view. It is based in the 1930's during the Great Depression. The story flips from the Joads-a family that is moving from Oklahoma in search of work in California-to little social commentary chapters that discuss the whole situation in general. I found this to be sort of like a modern day bible for it has the Joads made up of 12 people like the 12 deciples who are being pushed out of their homes like the jews. There is a character who plays the Jesus Christ role, another who symbolizes Judas, and an unborn baby who represents Moses. Don't get me wrong this book definately makes you think, but i found my self getting annoyed with this family because of their ignorance. I don't want to reveal to much in case you want to read it but personally i advise you to give spark notes a visit. This book is also very slow so if you have a short attention span then i suggest not reading it. If you enjoy Steinbeck novels then go for it, otherwise, just buy the cliff notes. It's not worth the time.
B00003CX5P|5.0|This movie was marvelous. Anybody who thinks otherwise are losers. These movies are for Star Wars fans, so i kinda understand why a non-fan would dislike it. But in my opinion I belive when years pass people will appreciate this movie a bit more. The movie was colorful, beautifully shot and a dream for Star Wars fans. This movie is a masterpiece from beginning to the end. Oh yeah and I loved Jar Jar.
B000002KHY|4.0|James Taylor released his debut album SWEET BABY JAMES in 1970. Nearly six years later,he put out his first compilation,this album. Here are his best from the Warner Brothers era. This album would be his last on the label. The title track from his debut album is cool. HOW SWEET IT IS TO BE LOVED BY YOU is awesome. That song,originally recorded by The Miracles,was later covered by Michael McDonald for his MOTOWN album. YOU'VE GOT A FRIEND is a cover of the Carole King recording which she wrote(on her 1971 smash debut TAPESTRY which JT participated on). FIRE AND RAIN,another 1970 hit,is cool. I love MEXICO. That song would be covered by Jimmy Buffett. DON'T LET ME BE LONELY TONIGHT was later covered by Eric Clapton with The Impressions. All the other songs are cool. This album could have used MOCKINGBIRD which he recorded with his now-ex-wife Carly Simon.
B00005JNEI|5.0|Threre are so many Bush supporters in America who are so brainwashed by the media.  Furthermore there are many reviewers here who are Bush supporters, giving low rating on this documentary.  These people really need to have open minds and understand the reality!  Here are PURE facts that nobody in the entire planet cannot deny:  <br /> <br />  <br />Starting in 1975 when Osama Bin Laden's older brother Saleem financed the young George Bush in his very first business with his very own oil company, Arbusto Energy Inc. Which the young Bush promptly drained of all it's cash and drove straight into the ground while extracting delirious profits for himself, to the present day where he exhibits the same pattern of sneaking in, then looting and driving the thing straight into the ground. <br /> <br />Under Mr. Bush, U.S.A. National Deficit is at its worst in our U.S. President History of 521 BILLION DOLLARS and climbing (CBS News). <br /> <br />Mr. Bush has polluted our country more than any other presidents in U.S. History (Includes air, water, land, energy, toxic waste). <br /> <br />\\"We need an energy bill that encourages consumption.\\"-President Bush, Sept. 23, 2002, Trenton, New Jersey, speech <br />  <br /> \\"First, we would not accept a treaty that would not have been ratified, nor a treaty that I thought made sense for the country.\\"-President Bush on the Kyoto Climate Change Treaty, Washington Post, April 24, 2001  <br /> <br />I praise Michael Moore for his bravery, honesty, and dedication to make this documentary to show what Mr. Bush has done for our country.  Mr. Bush uses our country as his money making playground. <br /> <br />87 billion dollars.  I can't fathom that much money to spend for another country.  Not ours. <br />  <br />
B0001I561E|5.0|When Aladdin came out in theatres in 1992, I was quite skeptical to say the least about seeing it in the theatres.  After all, I was 19 years old and thought I was much too old to be seen in a theatre with a bunch of kids.  I had not even yet seen Beauty and the Beast.  After seeing Aladdin, I was totally re-won over.  The story, music, characters, everything about it was so wonderful. <br /> <br />The DVD is that and so much more.  The picture is so clear and brilliant, it is almost like seeing it for the first time.  The extras are spectacular.  The videos (most of them anyway) are great.  It was cool to see the original video from 1992 for A Whole New World.  Mr. Aiken (always a pleasure to watch) once again delivers a powerful redering of the deleted \\"Proud of Your Boy.\\"  I guess the sweet newlyweds were fine for the new video of WNW...but totally unnecessary.  At least we did not get the obligatory teeny bopper stars of Disney Channel shows ruining a song...YUCK!! <br /> <br />Proud of Your Boy is a beautiful song that truely must have been gut-wrenching to cut from the film.  However, as the creators stated, it would have taken the plot in a completely different direction.  I only hope that an audio recording will be available soon with Clay singing it. <br /> <br />Overall, a must have for any fan of the remarkable Platinum Edition Disney masterpieces for the kid in all of us.
B000127LW2|5.0|I love Star Trek Voyager and I just ordered Season One on DVD, I was so excited when I heard that they were going to be releasing all the Seasons on DVD and I am eventually going to own all Seven Seasons, but it will probable take me awhile because of how expensive each season is I think they should lower the price to about $50.00 each but even if they don't I am still going to try to get them all because I love Voyager so much.

B000003BZ4|4.0|I got Gov't Mule's first cd on the recommendation of a friend, without ever hearing anything they've done.  This trio defies classification, I wouldn't necessarily call what they play the blues.  I could almost swear I hear licks by Clapton, Hendrix, slide by Joe Walsh, old Lynyrd Skynyrd, even some Al Stewart or Justin Hayward acoustic, and of course echoes of Duane and Dickie -- no surprise that the Allman Bros picked Warren to play guitar for them -- but it's all one virtuoso of a guy.  I didn't have to look at the liner notes to hear the harp-player from Blues Traveler (Mule).  Some pretty raw stuff here -- I've been the title character of Temporary Saint and it was almost agonizing to listen to.  But this is what good music is supposed to do, like good art: move you to experience pain or pleasure.  I'm going to proceed onward and check out their next albums, and work my way up to the present day.  Note:  I'm up to Deja Voodoo now, which is awesome.......
B00007FOMP|5.0|hi - i didn't want to confuse the meaning of my title message, but Chris of the \\" i don't see what is so good about this recording\\" is a an out and out wanker (read jerk-off) : Chris, my poor uninformed fool, this preceded many of the works you chatter about, like Stevie Wonder's Innervision. sure, each song would not stand up on its own, which is also true of Abbey Road and Dark Side Of The Moon (two other insignificant pieces of period work); however, they still managed to pull togather an amazing sense (dare i say) of a work complete. go back to whatever you were listening to before the drugs wore off, buddy, and enjoy yourself. this piece of work remains what it has been since 1971, an amazing piece of musical storytelling of the period : find me a better voice and social commentary, and i will rescind my criticisms. until then, good luck.

0312330529|5.0|One of the best works of fiction I have read in years. The first paragraph serves as an exquisitly written appetizer that whets the desire to feast on the remaining 900+ pages of the novel.  Shantaram is less a story about discrete events (though they are fascinating!) than one about how our journey through life can and should shape our understanding of personal responsibility, love and interconnectedness with others.  Roberts' prose, while unadorned, is sound enough to lead his readers convincingly and enthusiastically through the streets of Bombay and into the lives of many of its most colorful characters.  Although occasionally unable to contain his penchant for self-congratulatory sermonizing, Roberts' ability to express the depth of relationships is astonishing and evokes a powerful emotional response.  This is an old fashioned novel in the best sense of the term.  It called me back to my first reading of \\"Moby Dick\\" and \\"The Grapes of Wrath.\\"  Bravo, Gregory David Roberts!!!
B00005JNEI|5.0|Thank you Michael Moore, may God continue to send forth his messengers of truth and justice for all the world to see.
B00006JJ51|3.0|As a classic hip-hop album, \\"Straight Outta Compton\\" leaves more than a little to be desired.  The musical attack and lyrical stance of the first three tracks is pretty stunning, and, fantasy or not, \\"F*ck tha Police\\" is for the ages.  At the same time, however, when Ice Cube invokes Charles Manson as a measure of how bad he is twice in the course of that initial opening burst you start to think something's up.  Since these guys weren't really killing anybody, it's fair to assume they started bragging about doing so (as well as throwing the last 'ho out of bed after she gets Ice Cube off on the chilling \\"I Ain't tha 1\\") because they saw that it got them attention.  The violence and sexism in and of itself isn't really the problem - the issue is that, except for on \\"F--k tha Police,\\" they don't have jack to say about it.  This became even more apparent after Ice Cube left the group, and while his stance towards woman, (...), Asians etc. was pretty much inexcusable, the trenchant social commentary he brought to the table made his music compelling all the same.  After the first few tracks on \\"Straight Outta Compton,\\" Ice Cube pretty much drops out of sight, and even if he does provide lyrics for Eazy and Dre's cuts over the rest of the album they don't retain the same interest.  For further evidence of the group's calculated badass stance, note that the album seems to be divided into \\"Dirty\\" and \\"Clean\\" sides - the last half of the record has almost no profanity, while I count something like 86 f-words on \\"F--k tha Police\\" alone.  Furthermore, the clean tracks, aside from maybe \\"Express Yourself\\", are pretty dang dull.  While I can't deny the impact this group had, there are better, smarter, rappers in the world of gangsta (e.g. Ice-T, who actually has real moral sense and the brains to prove that's not antithetical to his subject matter), and beyond those first three songs, the aesthetic worth of \\"Straight Outta Compton\\" is pretty much nil.      After this album, of course, Ice Cube left and N.W.A went off the deep end, until by \\"Efil4zaggin\\" their \\"hard\\" stance was so over-the-top it practically amounted to an invitation to self-genocide.  Meanwhile, malt liquor spokesman Ice Cube became a movie producer, and hip-hop went on to better things. Personally, I'd suggest that if you want real ghetto poetry you ought to check out Ghostface Killah, who understands that actually having a soul isn't such a bad thing.
B00005JNEI|5.0|Fahrenheit 9/11 is without doubt one of the most powerful and moving films I've ever seen.  It is a film with an uncomprising vision - an unshakable determination to try to cut through all of the lies that the Bush administration has told to the American people and get at the truth behind the \\"war on terror\\" and the invasion and occupation of Iraq.  Though the film does have contain much of Mr. Moore's wit and humor (him driving around in an ice cream truck reading the Patriot Act to baffled Washingtonians is my personal favorite) at heart it is a deeply serious film, which calls on all Americans to think about just why this war is being fought, and what it is costing the Iraqi and American people. This is a film full of warmth, compassion, and an uncomprising respect for the human rights and human dignity of ALL people.  I cannot recommend this film highly enough, to ALL Americans, of all political affiliations.
B00005JNEI|5.0|Forget your political affiliation, be objective, and watch this film. The truth can only be ignored for so long. Mr. Moore presents a series of facts that demand our outrage. I would also highly recommend viewing the special features section- there is much to see. This is one of the most important films ever made. I can only hope everyone will give it a chance.
B000021XS0|5.0|Metropolis like many of DreamTheaters works is a Cd jammed with amazing sounds. This album without a shadow of a doubt is my favorite that is of course next to the Awake album an equally awesome peace of work.  As a raging Dream Theater fan I am of the belief that they always out do their self with every album.   <br /> <br /> <br />The sound Dream Theater produces is very unique. The sounds produced in the two songs 1928 overture and Dance of Eternity are the main reason I love to listen to them. They both start quite similar but go in to totally different directions.  I'm also a big fan of solos and that's something you get a lot of in Dream Theater work, especially in these two songs.  These are the songs were the band really shines.  I'm not saying James Labrie is a bad singer,  you simply get to see and hear the \\"bands\\" musical expertise in the instrumental songs, which I find to be the most attracting part of this amazing band. <br /> <br /> <br />Dream Theaters Metropolis CD is very theme oriented. To me it tells the story of a girl \\"Victoria\\" and her betrayal in a relationship gone bad. <br /> <br />The main reason I am drawn to listen to Dream Theater is the fact that they play solos. I love bands that make good music have good stories to tell and back it all up with solo. The band is remarkably talented to the amazing voice of James Labrie, the talented hands of keyboardist Jordan Rudess, the awesome bass lines of John Myung, the insane riffs of guitar player John Petrucci,  and last but not least the mind-boggling drummer from hell Mike Portnoy. <br /> <br />Dream Theater is definitely a band worth checking out, especially if this band has the time to write and compose a thirty minute song. \\"A Change of Seasons.   .If you love music you'll love these guys. <br /> <br />The closest sound to Dream Theater I can think of and many might disagree would probably have to be Living Color.  All their CD's are tremendous but if I had to recommend an alternative tometropolis it would definitely be Awake. <br />.
B0002OERI0|5.0|Wooow, I used to be a Green Day fan in my teens, when the single came out I thought \\"Well, another Green Day album, the same as ever\\". But I was wrong!Fool of me! This is the best album of the year, have no doubts about it and American idiot is probably the worst song of the album (although its good too).  <br />This band has evolved like any other band has evolved before (2 9 minute songs in a Green Day album?Whats going on here???)Yes, thats right, this album rocks! And I am not a Punk or Pop fan nowadays, although my music tastes have changed from my teens up to now I believe this album is great! Get it now!!
B0000027RL|5.0|First off, Ignore ANY negative reviews saying they've had no good albums/they're phony.  Where do you get the idea that they're phony?  I really don't get it at all...they made music for the sake of music, and they still do.  The members had been around for years before Pearl Jam formed, and they definitely have the ability to prove it.  Yeah, Nirvana made it possible for them to be heard, but honestly, who cares?  They'd be good either way, popular or not.  They were never really huge on being mainstream, thats why they stopped making videos.  If ANYONE is overrated, its Nirvana.  Secondly, every album after Ten proved that they were legends in the making.  Its hands down good old, kick ass rock and roll.  Those saying they were phonies, or that they have no other good albums, prove it.  Oh yeah, you can't.
1594200106|5.0|The Shadow of the Wind sweeps you away from the very first page. The characters are three dimensional and the plot riveting. To put this book down for even a little while, creates a distraction that makes functioning impossible. You can't stop thinking about it. This is a storyteller's story; weaving in and around itself to create an unforgettable experience. It is so complete, following all of the chraters to their ultimate release. I am already looking for another book by Carlos Ruiz Zafon.
B000060O58|5.0|This is priceless music-making.  One can really feel that Richter is performing and conducting from his own heart and love for Bach, and all the while the orchestra is inspired to sing and to dance with him.  The horns are laughing, the violins singing, and the listener is invited to experience flashes of happiness and joy with the chattering harpsichord.    When celestial music meets the summit of man's creative and loving spark, we lucky amateurs are left with this kind of immortal recording: glorious!
B00005JNEI|4.0|Farhenheit 9/11 is a glimpse into the last 4 years of the bush administration. It mocks President Bush for every bad move made along the way. Although alot of the anti-bush theories in the film are seemingly a little \\"far fetched\\" the film manages to be very funny and entertaining. It may be a one-sided documentary but its an interesting, sobering, laughable, and entertaining one at that.
B0002WYS6S|5.0|I think that the concert came out looking and sounding amazing.  James LaBrie sounds great on this one and even Mike Portnoy impressed me to a point singing-wise. The songs all sound great just as I hoped and \\"Instrumedley\\" is completely jaw dropping. The fact that they took many of their awesome instrumental sections from at least 7 songs and combined them all into one song was a great idea and it came out sounding so good and entertaining. My one little complaint is Jordan Rudess's keyboard leads in the Instrumedley sound a little too quiet, especially the ragtime piano solo in the second Dance of Eternity section but that may just be me because I love that part.  <br />       Also, the variety on this DVD is great. They took songs from all 8 of their studio albums as well as 2 Liquid Tension Experiment songs and they're all in one concert!!  Nice touch.  The extra features are entertaining, although I do miss the band commentary. Anyways enough with me rambling, amazing DVD!!!  Buy it now!
B0000666DW|5.0|Prog. Thrashmetal band Mastodon has released a masterpiece! Insane drumming, heavy guitars, crushing bass lines, and killer vocals. As soon as it starts Mastodon takes you and doesn't release you till then end, and by then you feel as though you've been slammed against a wall. The sure force and power of this band can't be summed up by words, you really have to experience the power and intensity of this band. This is a truly amazing work of art. Metal has another beast of brutality and that band is the incredible Mastodon.
B000069HJL|5.0|This album is fantastic. It is a great live album, it is a real \\"very best\\" compilation and it is really a sound improvement to the original. <br /> <br />I only had expected (I don't know they are cut from the original concert) some songs like \\"Give a Little Bit\\" or \\"Goodbye Stranger\\" or something from their two first albums, which are somewhat unknown. <br /> <br />I think that Rick Davies' contact with the public in the very first songs might have had more presence all along the recording. Sure he spoke a little more Anglofrench! It's funny to discover that the only songs which have a \\"presentation\\" are from the \\"Breakfast in America\\" album: \\"The Logical Song\\", \\"Breakfast in America\\" and \\"Take the Long Way Home\\". But still my favourites are \\"From Now On\\" and \\"Bloody Well Right\\". <br /> <br />Still is one of the best live albums I've ever heard. The performance of \\"Fool's Ouverture\\" should have been incredible. <br /> <br />Supertramp is a group to be remembered in the story of music. It is difficult to consider them as a \\"rock band\\" but they show some elements of what pop music would become in early 80's. And this recording is a must-have in your collection.
B00008S2VG|4.0|This isn't the most coherent review you'll read but I'll give it a try...  Before this album's release I saw the cover artwork online - and thought `yeah great` because it seemed to take its cue from the anti-war vibe that was in the air (for some of us), the marches and demonstrations. Again Madonna seemed to have caught the wave perfectly. I then bought the album. Well, I didn't like it at all. I found it's tone depressing, it's lyrics simplistic. After 6 months I still didn't like it. Reading many of the previous reviews it seems that it was at this point that interest in this album ended for many people. But now it's 2 years later and I've changed my mind. Why?  Firstly, it's definitely not the album the record company would have wanted, an album filled with breezy melodies and loud choruses. This album is definitely not pop music whose primary focus is melody. (Elton John for one has stated that `Die Another Day` is terrible because 'It had no melody') Madonna and those involved in making this music would have known that it would not appeal to the masses, that it might bomb. Yet Madonna released it anyway. In this light the album art now seems entirely relevant. It says `F@&% it.   On this record Madonna and her producers went for sound and vocals elements that are less melodic, flatter than we are used to. There is a deliberate repetition of notes in many of the vocal lines (Check out 'Nobody Knows Me'), but given time these prove no less compelling. The lyrics are also not as empty as the first appear. The track `Hollywood` for instance in which  each vocal section in the song seems to represent a different character like a musical version of Robert Altman's film `Short Cuts`. (Behind the vocals the music sounds like rattlesnakes) The song `Intervention` seems to be about rescuing someone from addiction - hence its link with the Chill Peppers` song `Under the Bridge`.   Lyrics are also a lot more abstract than I first thought, the cliches relate to each otherlike paint splattered on a modern canvas rather than conventionally. Another example of art over melody is the chorus of the opening song `American Life` which to my ears sounds woozy and processed.  A more celebratory version of this chorus can be heard on the `Oakenfold Downtempo Remix` (on the CD Single). Yet this more celebratory chorus which sounds `better` to the ear has been rejected for the album and indeed it would make less thematic sense.   For me there is a lot of art and intelligence on this album - whether that makes for satisfying listening is up to you
0316666343|4.0|The Lovely Bones is the story of a fourteen-year-old girl, Susie Salmon (\\"like the fish\\") who is invited by her neighbor Mr. Harvey into a makeshift shelter underneath a cornfield and is brutally raped and murdered. This is one of the best books that I have ever read. You get to see what life is like after death, as Susie tells the story from heaven where she sits and watches her family and friends grow older and try to get over her death.  <br /> As well as her family and friends you see Susie dealing with her own death and the fact that she will never get to live out her dreams or tell anybody that she loves them. However, towards the end of the book Susie gets a second chance when she inhabits a friend's body for a short period of time.I would highly recommend this book to anybody who likes mysteries that also have a heart behind them. <br />
1592400876|5.0|I, like the author of this wonderful book, have become somewhat obssessive - dare I say, extreme? - about punctuation everywhere I go; my wife says I have become compulsive. Read this book and join me.
B00005JNEI|5.0|Moore has made a good movie.  Is he in your face?  Yes.  Does he care?  No.  Sounds like someone called Bush.  Anyway, I enjoyed the movie and knew he would slant toward his viewpoint. That is ok.  At least he didn't lead us into a war with his slant of the facts.
B000002V0Q|5.0|After listening to 'Rust In Peace' I thought this could'nt get any better but no:-This album is amazing!It is so well produced,provides all metallers with the raw feel they need and takes creativity to really the next level and beyond.Also Daves vocals-Instaed of tollerating them and focus on the music,you really look forward to hearing them on each song.Freidman and Menza still at their productive best,this album offers unlimited listening intrique and pleasure.The strutcure of each song is so well produced,you can distinguish so distictly each track from another.This is a true Megadeth album finished product!It's got everything:-Excitement,Technique,Speed,Agression,unbelivable entertainment and even Humour!Buy it or you will be missing out on.Well-Arguably the best ever from Megadeth!
B00005JNEI|5.0|All I can say about this movie is Buy this one and watch it with  <br />everyone you know.  <br /> <br />The Country you save may be your own, and we need to get Mr.Bush and his buddys out of office.......and maybe even send them to  <br />Jail ......
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I didn't have much interest in this TV show but bought it anyway because it is from the god-like Joss Whedon.  I had recently become a huge convert to the Buffy-verse, but was dubious about the premise of a \\"space western.\\"  Silly me!  Once I'd watched and rewatched all my Buffy and Angel DVDs, I just had to have more Joss and turned in desperation to Firefly.  I was hooked less than halfway into the pilot movie and had to fight the urge to call in sick the next day so I could watch the whole series back-to-back.  I was so distressed when I got to the last episode, \\"Objects in Space\\", that I made myself go back and rewatch all the other episodes first so that I could savor the experience.  Imagine my delight when I got online and discovered that Joss and crew have already shot a feature film and that it will be out this spring!  Firefly lives! <br /> <br />Now, about this premise.  The western thing took awhile to buy into, but stick with it and before long galloping horses and the abundant use of \\"ain't\\" get less jarring as all the pieces fall into place.  It all works for two reasons - the ensemble cast is amazing and the cinematography is breathtaking.  It is so evident that each and every member of the cast and crew was having the time of their lives working on this show because each element is so meticulously perfect.  I don't have the vocabularly to convey how very, very good the cast is.  This show wouldn't have worked without Nathan Fillion.  Dare I say it?  He almost makes me forget Captain Piccard.  Charisma, angst, comedy, passion - not to mention the good looks.  This boy has it all.  Gina Torres is a goddess, and Summer Gua gives a beautifully nuanced performance.  Adam Baldwin is masterful, and it's a delight to see Ron Glass again.  <br /> <br />All the episodes work, but expect a wide range of genres.  There's horror (\\"Bushwacked\\"), comedy (\\"Our Mrs. Reynolds\\"), classic sci fi (\\"Ariel\\"), even a study of existentialism (\\"Objects in Space\\" - and thankyou to Joss for explainging that in the commentary).  The only episode I wasn't crazy about was \\"The Train Job\\" which isn't surprising since it was the network's misguided pilot do-over.  <br /> <br />This DVD set is loaded with extra features.  Half of the episodes have commentary.  Joss himself chimes in on three, and several members of the cast participate as well.  It is so, so refreshing that the stars of the show participate both in the commentaries and the \\"making of\\" featurettes.  I only have one teeny complaint.  More a piece of advice than a complaint, really.  The title and individual episode menus don't indicate which episodes have commentary; you have to click on the \\"language selection\\" option to find the commentary. <br /> <br />Words fail me.  I can't thank Joss Whedon enough for this masterpiece, and I am eternally grateful that he was so dedicated to the show that despite all obstacle he's made it into a feature film.  This is how much I love this show - I'm seriously considering buying a plane ticket from Armenia where I work to the States for the premiere of the film.  And I'm not even a sci fi geek!  Well, maybe a little.  I'd try to come up with more superlatives, but I must go order copies for all my family and friends.  This is an obsession that must be shared... <br />
068987474X|5.0|Yes, the messages in this book are not new.  However, to see these words expressed by \\"just a guy\\" and \\"just a gal\\", instead of Dr. Somebody brings a refreshing approach to relationship education.  I say take the opportunity to read up and pass the valuable info along to loved ones.      No more excuses! Lessen the time it takes to guess what's going on, over-anaylze a situation, or get stuck in self-doubt.
B000000OQF|5.0|guns n' roses were the last good band...and this is their best cd.
0440234743|3.0|Definitely not my favorite Grisham book, but it is still an enjoyable read.  The colorful details of the family members combined with the adventure of Brazil provided an intriguing novel.  The ending however was somewhat troubling for me.  There seemed to be no solid resolution that came from this twisted tale of woe.  I almost wanted a sequel so that I would know what happened to the rest of the characters.
B00008ADPF|4.0|'The Long Road' is a great 4th album release by this soft rock Canadian group. Nickelback will be around for a long time to come with plenty more songs and album releases to come. The magical chemistry that is lost on many bands can be found with this band. My all time favourite song from Nickelback is 'Someday', a deep heart-felt beat with beautiful lyrics and a memorising video-clip that goes along with it.<br /><br />For any fans of Nickelback, you won't be disappointed at all.
B000002KHH|5.0|Even though, \\"Iron Man\\" has been very overrated and over played this album would still be one of the best without it even on there! <br /> <br />The best songs would be War Pigs, Fairies Wear Boots, and Hand of Doon. The best of those three being the classic Anti War-Epic \\"War Pigs\\". I could easily go on and on about how much I love the song War Pigs, but I'll limit it a little bit. <br /> <br />It is such a great song. Ozzy's vocals are at his top-notch best here, there is no doubt in my mind of that. All of the guitar is also greatly timed by Tony Iommi. And some fantastic bass playing by Geezer. <br /> <br />Overall the album is an obvious Metal classic, but buy it for War Pigs alone. TRUST ME!
0553260111|5.0|I read this book a couple months after seeing the movie becasue I needed something to do. I am glad that I chose this book. I had never read anything by Ludlum before, but I plan to read many more of his books.    Reading this book was an awesome experience. You can actually feel the all the emotions that Bourne (or Webb) goes through. The Treadstone situation is an orginal and awesome idea. So is everything else in this book. All the characters and situations with Marie, Treadstone, Medusa, and Carlos are gretaly written. Everything is this book was made almost believable.    The actions scenes were incredible also. The confrontation in the treadstone house, the first fight on the boat, the graveyard with Conklin, and when Jason escapes the car and saves Marie, all are fun and exciting. This book is very easy to get into, and reading this will cause you to lose track of time. You just won't want to put this book down until you are through.    This book is fast-paced, easy to make sense of, and easy to read. If you were disappointed by the movie or not, or if you just want to dive deeper in the Bourne world, this book will take you there.
B00005JNEI|5.0|There must be a reason why Fahrenheit 9/11 is ranked #1 on Amazon and I can mention a few right here: <br /> <br />1. The movie pulls no punches.  It delivers a serious message  with verifiable facts in a way that moves people to tears and laughter, seconds apart from each other. <br /> <br />2. The movie is controversial.  It tells the story of how our current President and his administration have ties to oil interests in the Middle East, an old hatred of Saddam (\\"tried to kill my Daddy\\"), and a heretofore unmatched ability to make the wrong decisions based on preconceived and premeditated agendas without considering the costs in human lives or human dollars. <br /> <br />3. Tears. This movie could reverse a drought with the amount of tears it has evoked so far.  The power of anyone watching this movie to be moved to tears (and you will, trust me) is a powerful statement of it's importance and relevance right now.  We've all seen the destruction in New York City but we haven't ever understood some of the reasons it was allowed to happen, or why we find ourselves in a war in the wrong country, with no connections WHATSOEVER to the terrorists that brought 9/11 into our lives. <br /> <br />Just get this movie!  Like I needed to say that...
B00005NWM3|5.0|This is the best of the best of Nickelback with great songs created with the essence of messages behind each song. Almost each song has an internal message and a heart felt plea of modern ailments that is affecting our societies today such as drug and alcohol abuse, domestic voilence, cheating etc. All these songs cover these issues and more. Each song is sung with emotion and feeling by Chad and followed up by the rest of the band.<br /><br />This is Nickelback at their superb best. Other great songs to listen too are Too Bad (a father and son relationship that goes sour), Money Brought (where fame leads to corruption) and Hangnail (a breakup between a couple - from a male's perspective)
B000063DFN|5.0|There is barely any doubt in my mind that Iron Maiden is the greatest band ever. And this, most likely is and as the majority would agree their best work. <br /> <br />Aces High: The absolute perfect song to start off this amazing album with. It starts with the awesome firey intro riff, that goes into the spectacular fast riff, that has become famous around here, as I listen to that riff over and over again every time I listen to this song. bThe rest of the song is great also. I love the chrous, and the outro rocks too. <br /> <br />2 Minutes to Midnight: Dare I say overrated? I would have to say it is, as most of the Maiden singles clearly are. This is one of their best singles and is still a great song. Love the lyrics and the catchy chorus too. Probably my favorite single ever released by Iron Maiden. <br /> <br />Losfer Words: This is underrated in my opinion. GREAT instrumental track here. The song isn't necessarilly that heavy or that fast, but the pace is great and it is full of classic, great Riffs. <br /> <br />Flash of the Blade:I really enjoy this song every time I listen to it. It isn't the best here, but it isn't the worst either, and it always injects some extra adrenaline into me every time a pop it into my CD player. <br /> <br />The Duelists: Out of the first 6 tracks on the whole CD, this would defnitely be my favorite. I even like it more then Aces High, which is really saying something. Great great solo and guitar work. Especially in the 3 and a Half minute instrumental in the middle of this amazing work of art. <br /> <br />Back in the Village: Another underrated song, in my opinion. Love the main riff/intro riff. Amazingly fast and energetic. Great song all around. Plus, it has a cool ending that leads into the title track <br /> <br />Powerslave: WHOA! This and the next song \\"Rime of the Ancient Mariner\\" are my favorite two on the whole album. I have come a long way with this song. At first, I thought it was extremely overrated and was reallynothing compared to most of the songs on Powerslave, but it grew on me a little more and more every time I decided to listen to it. And then one day I was listening to it and then said to myself \\"Wow, what was I thinking? This song ROCKS!\\" The guitars are amazing, and Dickinson is top notch and this song also. <br /> <br />Rime of the Ancient Mariner: The 13 minute Epic Masterpiece that Maiden chose to end this classic album off with. Like I said this and \\"Powerslave\\" are my two favorite songs on here, like many others also. And that just shows you really how great these songs are. Not much can be said for this song that already has been said it. You really just have to hear it to believe it. <br /> <br />
B000001FAU|5.0|this is where power rock started, way to go what a team blackmore and DIO!  the only thing better than this line up was DIO's sabbath days!
B00005JNEI|5.0|Republican or democrat, liberal or conservative, rich or poor, left or right, who cares, just watch this.  It would be nice if people just threw away their biases and affiliations and just for once, opened up their minds.  In an age of unprecendent media viewership and domination of the world, it's hard to tell what to accept and what not to accept.  However, one always knows whether something is right or wrong.  A live clip of an explosive attack against a post of American troops, mutilated corpses, dead babies...those are nothing that special effects could ever touch. These things could never be staged.   <br /> <br />I don't care what your beliefs are, but if you just walked away from this movie, shrugging it off with whatever premanufactured dismissals of a work of this nature and magnitude, you are beyond ignorant.  A forceful generalization, yes indeed.  If you refuse to watch this film for any other reason than it's extremely graphic and rather disturbing nature, you need to open up your eyes to the real world.   <br /> <br />Michael Moore is obviously biased, but who isn't?  I will not say that I completely agree with his beliefs, having read all of his works and watched Bowling for Columbine.  However, in Fahrentheit 9/11, Moore barely interjects his opinions like has in his previous works.  He does something that very fiew journalists, news channels, politicians, and Americans have remotely done--let the evidence do the talking.   <br /> <br />I give this movie 5 stars as a concerned individual growing up in this world.  I am not even old enough to vote, and I have no political affilations.  I am giving it 5 stars because it realistically depicts the realities of this world.  Let me place an emphasis on reality.  Fahrentheit 9/11, though clearly biased and with certain discrepancies, shows you what numbers, campaign ads, newspapers, news stations, and politicians cannot--reality.
B000063CPL|4.0|I really like this live album by the greatest band of all time. It isn't up to par with \\"Live after Death\\", which was the greatest live album ever. My complaints would be too much material from Brave New World, and the lack of songs from such classic albums such as Powerslave, Somewhere in Time, etc. <br /> <br />Other then that, this is greatness all around. <br /> <br />My favorite two are The Clansman and Sign of the Croos, which were actually great when Blaze did them, but friggin awesome with Bruce on the vocals! Great, amazing renditions of the classic tracks.

0804106304|5.0|Amy Tan's novel of many voices has become required reading in high school and college contemporary literature courses - and for good reason.  Its intimate look at Chinese immigrants and their children opens up a wealth of questions about cultural acclimation in a country dominated by another race.  Set in San Francisco and China, the novel begins with Jing-Mei (\\"June\\"), who has been asked by her father to take her recently deceased mother's place in the Joy Luck Club, ostensibly a mah jong gathering of her mother's closest friends, but also an investment club, symbolizing the merging of the two cultures.  June agrees, although she doesn't feel she makes an adequate substitute for a woman who seemed so unlike her.  When her \\"aunties\\" urge June to tell her sisters, women she has never met and who were left at the side of a road in China, about her mother's life, they are troubled when she confesses that she did not know her mother except as a mother.  She sees that they fear that their own daughters might not know about them, and so she  impulsively promises to find her mother's long lost children and tell them about their mother.  In this way, the novel sets up its structure of interrelated stories. Although the stories of June and her mother Suyuan frame the others, those of An-Mei, Rose, Lindo, Waverly, Ying-ying, and Lena are no less important.<br /><br />These women and their daughters form a complicated quilt of what it means to be a Chinese-American, whether born in China or in the United States, and they highlight the difficulties of bridging two cultures.  The choices each woman makes are always difficult and often heart-breaking.  Students might want to explore the difference in attitude between the Chinese women and their American daughters.  Other topics for discussion include comparing and contrasting the relationships; the meaning of \\"Chinese blood\\" in the context of what unfolds; whether this is a true novel or a collection of stories; the ways in which the title refers not only to the actual Joy Luck Club but to the book in general; and the use of voice to convey characterization.<br /><br />This accessible, well-written first novel is not Amy Tan's most accomplished (see The Kitchen God's Wife and The Bonesetter's Daughter), but it is her most widely read.  Highly recommended for a general readership.ch the title refers not only to the actual Joy Luck Club but to the book in general; and the use of voice to convey characterization. <br /> <br />This accessible, well-written first novel is not Amy Tan's most accomplished (see The Kitchen God's Wife and The Bonesetter's Daughter), but it is her most widely read.

B000002G26|2.0|<br />The title of this CD \\"So Far So Good\\" is right on the point, this is as good as it gets for Bryan Adams. Loosely translated this means grab some lighter fluid and a match and put this disk out of its misery. <br />     Don't get me wrong, I ABSOLUTELY LOVE Bryan Adams! But for some reason this greatest hits collection makes me wonder why I stood in the pouring rain for 18 hours just to ensure I was in the front row for his \\"No one like my music anyway, its all about the money for me\\" tour. I was a teenage freak for everything Adams did and would have shoveled his sidewalk with my tongue if it meant getting the chance to meet him! <br /> Now I find myself in my 30's wandering aimlessly through record stores trying in vain to find an artist, ANY ARTIST, that can create such moving, heartfelt music. And just as I was about to give up and buy yet another copy of Mother Love Bone's Stardog Champion to ease my mind I found this So Far So Good CD. I had no choice but to pick it up, I can't believe my friend Tim (who is just as big of a Adams nut as me!!) didn't tell me it was out there waiting to be enjoyed. <br /> Talk about anti-climactic, I feel worse than I did after wasting an entire weekend at Alpine Valley watching Phish perform Kenny Rodgers covers. (I guess I just don't get the artistic form of playing around the music) I will give this CD a 2 star rating because \\"Please forgive me\\" is on it and it still makes me weak in the knees. But I would have given it a much higher rating if Adams would have dug deeper into his background and included some great songs from Rock N Roll like \\"Shallow\\" and \\"So Alive\\". If he wanted really wanted this CD to sell he would have included \\"This House Is Not For Sale\\" or \\"City Rain, City Streets\\" from the Love is Hell album. (The City Rain song is the evil twin of Prince's Purple Rain, but I wont get into what Prince does for me, I don't think they would print it :-) <br />
B0002ZYE1Y|4.0|Firstly, to clarify, Nightwish sound nothing like Evanescence. So if you hate Evanescence, then let me assure you that Nightwish is a million times better.  As to this album, it is a good album, but when compared to their other albums, I think it is not the best. I much prefer the Wishmaster and Oceanborn era. Once sounds, if I had to compare, most like Century Child. However, unlike CC, it has much more orchestra and choirs, and, I think, not enough of Tarja singing. I also wish the guitars were showcased more, even if that would mean less orchestra.  But all in all, it is still a good album. Worth buying. I give it 4 out of 5 stars.
068987474X|5.0|There is humor mixed in with the telling of the simple truth about the way men operate.  Greg Beherendt has a lot of compassion for all of us in telling us, \\"Don't waste the pretty.\\"  I learned a long time ago that men know what men are up to, just as women know women.  The book on women would take volumes.  This book is one thin volume.  Men are not that complicated.  Greg says, \\"Don't waste the pretty.\\"  He made it very clear that if a man is 'into you' he will move heaven and earth to be with you.  On the other hand, men would rather be run over by a train, get their legs cut off and lose their right eye (my words) rather than just tell you, \\"I'm just not that into you.\\"  You find out in this book that it is just that simple.  There is no figuring it out.  Greg goes over every excuse you have ever heard.  There is no turn unstoned.  Read this book.  Laugh at the humor.  Learn.   And don't waste the pretty!
1558216847|5.0|.<br /><br />********************************************<br /><br />I'm 90% through reading THE LONG WALK by Slavomir Rawicz.  My sister-in-law Pricilla, passed this book on to me, and I'm grateful.  It's the best book I've read this year, and hard to put down.<br /><br />This story tells a scary society that is not free.  Something to think about.<br /><br />**********************************************<br /><br />Slavomir Rawicz was a Polish Cavalry Officer in 1941 when Germany and Russia steamrolled over Poland. Guilty of nothing, Rawicz details how he was brain washed, tortured, beaten, drugged by the Russians, and finally sentenced to 25 years of hard labor in Siberia.  I was stunned by the brutality of the Russians, and the Nazi-like world they created.  The fatality rate due to the hardships encountered, I found, horrifying.<br /><br />Rawicz is young, 25, and toughed by the thousand mile winter march from the Trans-Siberian Railroad to the labor camp, and by the people dying around him.  He survives, builds his strength, and later escapes with a group of men who dared to walk 3000 miles at 20 miles a day.  The whole journey from Poland to Siberia including the 1000 mile winter march, and the 3000 mile walk from Siberia to India are compelling example, of grit, spirit, determination, and will-power.<br /><br />I'm compelled to search for still more information on these dark days.  This book shows a narrow slice, albeit in great detail, of the atrocities committed by the USSR in its formative years. This is a period of history that needs much wider dissemination, and discussion.<br /><br />Rawicz is still alive; living in England.  God bless him.<br /><br />Conrad Senior
B00005R2M3|4.0|Some people may be familiar with Shakira from her Spanish albums, which include \\"Donde Estan Los Landros\\" and \\"Pies Descalzos\\". Shakira was one of the first Latin stars to cross over to the English market, with the major exception of Selena. Shakira's English debut was released in 2001, a year which had many wonderful artists that unfortunately became one-hit wonders. Also, by that time, most pop singers had already established their roles (Britney at that point was starting to grow up, whereas Pink took on a more pop-rock approach) so it was a difficult year for any newcomer. Shakira once said that she would not feel comfortable singing any one else's music, which is probably why Shakira herself, with occasional help from Gloria Estefan, wrote every song on the album. Shakira's vocal style takes some getting used to but her debut is stellar nevertheless, especially considering that she hardly spoke English when it was released. <br /> <br />The album starts off with the catchy single \\"Objection (Tango)\\". In this song, Shakira describes how her man is paying more attention to another woman than he is to her. There are a couple of points in the song that do not make sense (\\"I love you for free and I'm not your mother\\") and except for one misused word (Shakira says \\"silicon\\", which is something used in computer chips, instead of \\"silicone\\"), the song sounds wonderful. \\"Underneath Your Clothes\\" comes next and while the song sounds odd at first, it soon proves to be a romantic, sweet ballad that suits Shakira impeccably. The lyrics are sappy but beautiful. (\\"Because of you, I forgot the smart ways to lie, because of you, I'm running out of reasons to cry\\"). After this song comes \\"Wherever, Whenever\\", an extremely Latin-sounding song that showcases Shakira's ability to make catchy, upbeat songs. The song doesn't necessarily say a lot, but it is fun to listen to anyway. <br /> <br />\\"Rules\\" follows and basically describes the rules Shakira outlines for her man. (\\"Use youreyes only to look at me\\"). While this is not one of the better songs on the album, it is still enjoyable enough and definitely does not demand to be skipped as soon as it comes on. \\"The One\\" is lyrically one of weaker songs and it carries on much in the same vein as \\"Underneath Your Clothes\\" though it is not nearly as strong. The song is by no means horrible. In fact, it's great however \\"Underneath Your Clothes\\" is better. After this one comes a personal favourite entitled \\"Ready For the Good Times\\". This song is probably the strongest lyrically though it borders on repetitive in many places. It's a very upbeat, almost disco-ish song that suits Shakira surprisingly well.  <br /> <br />Another personal favourite, \\"Fool\\", is up next. This song is about being in love with someone who's hurting you and knowing that you're a \\"fool\\" for staying with him. (\\"But I can't help it if I'm just a fool, always having my heart set on you\\"). After this comes \\"Te Dejo Madrid\\" which means (note that I do not know a word of Spanish) either \\"I'm Leaving Madrid\\" or \\"I'm Leaving For Madrid\\". Even though I do not understand this song at all, I do know that Shakira sounds even better in Spanish then she does in English (which is obvious, as Spanish is her native language). Another personal favourite, \\"Poem To A Horse\\", is up next. The title actually means that Shakira feels that spending time with her man is as pointless as reading poetry to a horse. Lyrically, this song is a little confusing but still great and Shakira sounds spiteful and angry which adds a lot to the effect of the song.  <br /> <br />Three out of the final four songs are in Spanish, a nice finishing touch for Shakira's fans who enjoyed her Spanish albums as well as for the English-speaking fans. While we may not understand the songs very well, it is always good to hear a singer use their native language because they generally sing with more passion. \\"Que Me Quedes Tu\\" is up first and is actually quite long considering how short the lyrics are (as evidenced by how they are written up in the liner notes). Nonetheless, Shakira sounds particularly good. After that comes the English song of the group, \\"Eyes Like Yours\\", which was translated into English by Gloria Estefan. The song has a kind of middle-eastern vibe though the lyrics are not the strongest. This can be forgiven however seeing as this is a translation. This is not one of the stronger tracks on the album but it is still enjoyable enough. Lastly, there are Spanish versions of \\"Objection\\" and \\"Wherever, Whenever\\". These too are a little friendlier to the English-speaking fans since we at least have a vague idea of what Shakira's singing. Personally, I like the Spanish version of \\"Objection\\" (the last song on the album) better but both of them make a great finish to the album. <br /> <br />Overall Mark: 4/5 <br /> <br />Overall, a few things have to be taken into account when listening to Shakira's English debut. First and foremost, it is important to remember that Shakira could barely speak English when this album was released. Her English songs do not sound like they were sung phonetically so that is a pretty big accomplishment. Secondly, Shakira was making her debut when most other big names in pop music were on at least their second album, thus making it hard to compare any of them to Shakira. Of all the pop stars, J Lo is probably closest in style to Shakira but there is no doubt which of the two is better. Finally, Shakira wrote both the lyrics and music to every single song on the album, an incredible feat considering the language barrier. Unfortunately, this means that the lyrics are not the strongest and even confusing in places, thus taking away from the overall quality of the album. Nevertheless, Shakira' debut is definitely worth a listen. <br />
B00005JNEI|5.0|I was against 'Bush's War' from the beginning.  Like Michael Moore, I was criticized as unpatriotic and unsupportive of the troops (even though I served in the US Army from 1978-1984).  I had seen much of the information presented in the film previously, though from separate sources such as books and newspaper articles.  What Moore has done with 'Fahrenheit 9/11' is bring all the various facts concerning the Bush administration's misadventures all together in one controversial film.<br /><br />No one should kid themselves-Michael Moore is a partisan ,and is firmly against what George Bush and his cronies represent. He fully expected - and welcomed - the firestorm of criticism his film generated. The irony is that as time goes by, more and more of what is presented in 'Fahrenheit' is being confirmed by former members of the Bush administration, arms inspectors in the Iraq invasion aftermath, and even by Bush and Cheney themselves!  Even powerful members of Bush's own Republican Party are now condemning the mess that the Iraq 'liberation' has become.<br /><br />I was enraged by what I saw in this movie.  How could so many Americans be so blind (and a large proportion of the population STILL refuses to see the truth)?  How could our media function as a cheerleading section for what was happening?  If nothing else, this film is a call to all Americans to vote to change the direction our country is now headed (or at minimum, at least express SOME kind of opinion by going to the ballot box).<br /><br />If you haven't yet done so, see this film.  Formulate your opinion not just on what you see from it, but look at other sources.  Then VOTE your conscience either way, but please vote!<br /><br />The thousands who have died and shed blood defending your right to do so cry out against complacency, especially in the year 2004!
B0002KQNL8|1.0|I should have listened to Harry from Ain't It Cool News. He warned fans that the music was differant on the DVD. But I thought he meant the songs. Losing the rights to songs, and putting different songs in their place for home video is nothing new. But it is the entire score that is different. And the new score is mind numbingly horrible. It completely ruins the movie. There is also a voice over narration at the beggining of the film that I don't remember being there in the theatrical or VHS version. And even more strange, is that when you switch over to the French language track, it is still the original score. This makes no sense at all. Warner Bros. really messed up with this one. I hope they re release it with the proper score. In the meantime, since I know Circuit City won't refund mt money, I'm going to see if Warner Bros. will.
B00005JMJ4|5.0|A great film in the study of subtle acting and quiet atmospheres. A+.
B00004TRD8|4.0|This movie is said to be one of the best sequels in Scream 2 - which is in fact itself a sequel. And indeed it is a great sequel, with the only slight annoyance being Edward Furlong and his ever changing voice! (He is clearly much younger in the desert, for instance, than in other scenes. His voice began to break and had to be pitched to one level in post-production.) With Linda Hamilton looking about as unfeminine as Madonna is now, and Arnie as the good guy this time round (Arnie said during the making of this film that he would never play another evil character again, but he later played the villain Mr. Freeze in Batman & Robin), this is truly a great sequel. Although I do prefer Nick Stahl as John Connor in T3, than Edward Furlong.<br /><br />There seems to be a lot of twin stuff in this movie, as Linda's sister, Leslie came in to be a double in scenes involving two &#34;Sarah Connors&#34; (i.e., when the T1000 was imitating her), and in a scene where Sarah removes the Terminator's CPU, and threatens to destroy it, her sister is basically in the mirror! And also identical twins Don Stanton and Dan Stanton played the hospital security guard and the T1000.<br /><br />If you were a fan of Michael Biehn in the first movie, he makes a reappearance in this, in Sarah's dream sequence, and warns her that THEIR son is in danger. She has to save him, etc. They kiss and then she wakes up. This is the only scene that Michael Biehn was in, and appeared in some promotional trailers. Cameron cut the scene because he thought that audiences who had not seen the first movie would be confused by the appearance of Kyle. But it is included on the cut shown on the DVD.<br /><br />Many scenes included on the DVD for you enjoyment and not in the theatrical release include:<br /><br />--&#62; A hospital scene was cut that took place directly after the pre-med students peer into Sarah's room. The doctor reminds the orderlies to make sure she gets her medication. The cut scene was of the staff coming in to give her the pills. They smack her in the gut with their batons and force the pills down her throat, then kick her while she's on the floor doubled over in pain. (This scene had to be re-shot several times because actor Ken Gibbel wouldn't hit Linda Hamilton properly with his nightstick. The scene was very physically demanding and Hamilton was furious with Gibbel because he repeatedly botched it. She got her revenge in a later scene where she beats Gibbel with a broken off broom handle - the blows are for real.)<br />--&#62; After the T-1000 kills John's foster parents, he ventures outside to get the dog to shut-up. He reaches down and snatches the collar off the dog, thus killing the dog. On the collar is stamped the dog's name &#34;Max&#34;. The T-1000 realizes he has been duped by John (actually the T-800 imitating John's voice) by calling the dog &#34;Wolfie.&#34;<br />--&#62; After killing the dog, the T-1000 goes to John's room to try to find any clues as to where John might be. He stalks around the room waving his arms and &#34;feeling&#34; things on the shelves, on the walls, etc. He eventually stops in front of a poster, realizes there is something behind it, rips it down and finds a box of mementos (pictures, and the like). This must be where the T-1000 figures out about the desert compound that Sarah, John, and the T-800 head to after the hospital. James Cameron decided to cut it because it made the T-1000 look too much like it had x-ray vision.<br />--&#62; At the abandoned gas station, a scene involved Sarah and John talking with the T-800 about learning. He tells them that his CPU was switched to read-only before being sent out. Cyberdyne doesn't want them to learn too much while on their own. John asks can it be switched and he says yes. You then see the T-800's face in a &#34;mirror&#34; talking Sarah through the procedure. A puppet was used for the foreground Sarah to work on and Linda's twin sister Leslie was in the mirror mimicking Linda's hand movements. After the CPU is removed, the T-800 shuts-down and Sarah places it on a table. She picks up a hammer and tries to smash it to render him inoperative. John stops her and says they need him. He starts to show authority for the first time and says to Sarah, &#34;How am I supposed to be a world leader if my own mother won't listen to me?&#34;<br />--&#62; A scene in a Skynet-free future, with Sarah Connor as an older woman giving a monologue about how John became a senator.<br /><br />Given Arnie's $15 million salary and his total of 700 words of dialog, that translates to $21,429 per word. &#34;Hasta la vista, baby&#34; cost $85,716.<br /><br />This is a great sequel, and well worth getting, although if you find Edward Furlong an annoying little brat like I did, then watch T3 and have your faith in movies reaffirmed.removed, the T-800 shuts-down and Sarah places it on a table.

B00005JNEI|5.0|I'm sure you folks have heard time and time again about this documentary.  I just want to encourage you to watch Fahrenheit 9/11, regardless of party affiliation.  I find it best to watch this movie with an open mind, free of any preconcieved ideals or beliefs.  Just go into this documentary with a clear and open mind.  Michael Moore will show you the facts, and let you decide for yourself. <br /> <br />My only issue with this documentary is how short it seemed.  Even though the running time is 122 minutes, I felt Mr. Moore could have gone into more detail in several areas.  However, I guess he had to leave some parts of the documentary on the cutting room floor. <br /> <br />All in all, this a great documentary that should be seen by everyone at least once.  Do yourself a favor and go see Fahrenheit 9/11 soon, you owe it to yourself to see all points of view when it comes to this election.
B00003CXCT|5.0|The \\"STAR WARS\\" films are great and the digital transfer (remasterd by THX, for the ULTIMATE viewing experience and 5.1 Dolby Surround EX) is BETTER THAN EVER. The classic score by John Williams is great. Mark Hamill, Harrison Ford (\\"Indiana Jones\\" trilogy, \\"The Fugitive,\\" etc.) and Carrie Fisher's  performances as Luke Skywalker, Han Solo and Princess Leia have become legendary. Of course, the most fascinating and intriguing character in the series is the villain, Darth Vader. I don't know how Lucas did it (getting James Earl Jones' voice to coincide exactly with Vader's movements, because HE wasn't the one in the suit; David Prowse, now 66 years old and struggling with arthritis and a dodgy hip, was the man behind the mask), but James Earl Jones did an AWESOME job providing the voice of Darth Vader. EXCELLENT choice, sir.<br /><br />\\"STAR WARS Episode IV: A New Hope\\" featured the legendary Sir Alec Guiness as Obi-Wan Kenobi and is the introduction to this trilogy, with refrences to the previous film.<br /><br />\\"STAR WARS Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back\\" is the darkest entry in the saga (so far, wait for the final prequel, which will tell how Anakin [a cute Jake Lloyd in \\"Episode I\\" and a terrific Hayden Christensen in \\"Episode II\\"] becomes Darth Vader, voiced by James Earl Jones). The scene where Han Solo (Harrison Ford) dies in \\"Episode V\\" is very sad and poignant.<br /><br />\\"STAR WARS Episode VI: Return Of The Jedi\\" is the exciting conclusion to this epic saga. Excellent climactic duel between Vader and Luke. Harrison Ford (Han Solo), Peter Mayhew (Chewbacca), Anthony Daniels (C-3PO) and Kenny Baker (R2-D2) provide comic relief in all three films.<br /><br />Now just a few of the questions die-hard \\"STAR WARS\\" fans are burning to have answered.<br /><br />\\"What did Darth Vader mean when he said to Obi-Wan in their climactic duel in \\"Episode IV\\": \\"You should not have come back\\"? What did Yoda mean when he said in \\"Episode V\\": \\"If you take the easy way, as Vader did\\"? Why did Anakin look like he had cancer when his face was revealed at the end of \\"Episode VI\\"? HOW WAS Anakin Skywalker \\"Seduced by the Dark Side of the Force,\\" thus becoming Darth Vader, probably the most iconic screen villain of all time?<br /><br />These questions (and more) will be answered in the final chapter \\"STAR WARS Episode III: Revenge Of The Sith\\", coming May 19, 2005.<br /><br />I can't wait for \\"STAR WARS EPISODE III: Revenge Of The Sith.\\" Good thing Lucas included a preview of \\"Episode III\\" (eight minutes, to be exact) on the fourth disc (sorry, you die-hards, no scenes of \\"Episode III\\" included). Makes me EAGER for it to show in theaters NOW, but Lucas is a master of making exciting movies, so we'll just have to wait for May 19, 2005, when \\"STAR WARS Episode III: Revenge Of The Sith\\" opens in theaters nationwide to see how Anakin is seduced by the Dark Side of the Force, how he assumes control of the Empire, establishing it as the most feared in the galaxy, how he exterminates the Jedi knights and of course, how he became the most feared and fascinating villain of all time, aided by the excellent voice of James Earl Jones, Darth Vader. Expect a PG-13 rating on this one, if not PG. All of the films in the trilogy are rated PG for sci-fi action-violence.he had cancer when his face was revealed at the end of \\"Episode VI\\"?

B00005JMUA|3.0|Kill Bill, Vol. 2 is a good film, but it's not great and this is probably due to the producers forcing Tarantino to split Kill Bill up into two films instead of his originally envisioned one and I have to say that this was an incredible mistake. <br /> <br />The visuals are dazzling, and instead of the predominantly samurai with western influences, we find ourselves walking through more of a western influenced by the way of the samurai. <br /> <br />A primary issue I find here is the dialogue. There is a constant need to go back to the original, or looking through backstory, and as I watch I feel like saying, \\"we know this already, let's get to the meat of the film.\\" When the film actually gets going, it's incredibly entertaining but on a number of occasions everything just seems to stop, and it can't be blamed on the out-of-sequence filming that Tarantino is known for. In Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction there is a flow even with the irregular sequence.  <br /> <br />In Kill Bill vol. 2, we actually feel out of sequence and the flow stops at times.  <br /> <br />For me, it just simply feels like the two films should have been allowed to be released as one. Tarantino's editing of the second volume looks rushed, perhaps from his extreme displeasure of having to split up what he felt was his masterpiece. I think if the two were combined, Kill Bill could very well have been that. Instead, I just find myself watching the first one and never truly reaching for the sequel.  <br /> <br />In my opinion, the above-average but not perfect Volume 2 is flawed but should not be attributed to Tarantino. This is a prime example of what happens when Executive Producers think they can make films better than Directors.  <br /> <br />You're still on my good list, Q.

B0000B1OFL|4.0|I'll just out and say this: The Italian Job is a fun movie. Originally I felt shafted, being a fan of the Sutherlands, but I do have to say that Wahlberg and Theron make this an extraordinary film.  <br /> <br />The action scenes are incredibly unpredictable and well-thought out without catering to the lowest common denominator (i.e., random explosions, millions of bullets and the like). Edward Norton does a terrific job playing the slimy double-crosser and with Jason Statham, Mos Def and Seth Green backing up our two main protagonists this is probably one of the few ensemble casts without any real weaknesses.  <br /> <br />Mark Wahlberg has had me hooked since \\"Three Kings,\\" and \\"The Italian Job\\" only adds to his growing resume. Charlize Theron is incredible as always and she manages to take a role that could have easily become a cliche and make it completely unique.  <br /> <br />I've never seen this director before, but with the planning and camerawork that went into the film, you can bet that I'll be looking for him again in future films. This is one of those movies that you can always count on if you feel like popping a DVD in the player. This belongs on everyone's list.
B000002546|5.0|I've read the reviews here, and one thing becomes apparent as I do... amongst those who truly love this album you will notice that everybody seems to cherish different songs on it.  That to me is the hallmark of a classic recording.  I myself have been listening to this album since 1976, and I've never tired of it.  Each time it reveals something new to me.  There is so much I could say, but don't have the words.  In the end, for me my favorite (if I had to pick one) would be Diamond Dust, although I love every song on this album, and it will always be one of my all time favorites.  Give it a try, because it will change you for the better.
B00005JN2X|5.0|Let me get this out for you impatient folks. <br /> <br />Watch this movie now. Right now. Do not go to your girlfriend's house, do not go to the bank. Go now, break in if you don't have cash, hijack the damn theatre if you absolutely have to. <br /> <br />There is no descriptive phrase in any appropriate language to totally convey the intensity of this film. Over recent films, (Most notably Bourne Supremacy and The Manchurian Candidate), I complained about inappropriate use of \\"documentary\\"-style shots (i.e., Handicam, Steadycam, etc.). Perhaps not inappropriate, but it was done to the point of making your eyes hurt. That's not particularly enjoyable. <br /> <br />The reason why I complained is that they could be much, much better. How I know this is because of Michael Mann, director of Manhunter, The Insider, Heat, Ali and of the most classic of Miami Vice episodes. He is considered one of the best innovative filmmakers of all time in terms of cinematography, if not the best.  <br /> <br />However, if there was any doubt that he was number one, Collateral has officially obliterated any argument anyone might have about his skills.  <br /> <br />If anyone has seen the cancelled Robbery Homicide TV show (starring Tom Sizemore), they'll recognize the style and atmosphere of Collateral immediately. If you have been not paying attention to anything said about this movie, the basic premise is simple: Jamie Foxx is a cab driver who picks up Tom Cruise as a fare, only Cruise is a hit man who has five people to kill by the end of the day, and needs the driver to get him around Los Angeles.  <br /> <br />If you've been to Los Angeles, you will quickly recognize that the feel of the locations used in this film are definitely the City of Angels. It's not closed in and utterly urban as New York is, or as nightclub-touristy as Miami. This is SoCal, the wide open sprawl where anyone can meet anyone, but no one really does.  <br /> <br />To say Tom Cruise is excellent would be onpar with saying Russel Crowe's Maximus was an above average performance. I have not seen a more real character in my life. This is the performance that everyone hopes they can muster up one day but never do. You are frightened, intrigued, and ultimately riveted by every solitary second that Cruise is on screen. There is an undercurrent of emotions running through him and you can feel it, yet there is no change in his breathing, facial features or speech. The only way possible to explain it is that he has an aura about him that is rarely captured on film, and whether that's credit to Mann or Cruise or both is totally up to debate.  <br /> <br />Jamie Foxx is likewise excellent. He is a real human being, he is trying his hardest to stay alive, but Foxx does not portray him over the top. He is understated, freezing up like anyone else would do instinctively, and we all are putting ourselves in his shoes. There is a vulnerability throughout the film just by Foxx's eyes that you are entranced by and can't help but hope that he'll make it out of here. This is the film that will launch Foxx's dramatic career.  <br /> <br />The secondary cast does not have much of a role, but what we do see is superb. Mark Ruffalo is a narc officer and we are always hoping that eventually he will catch up. He is also a driven, but understated character and his few scenes do shine, in that underworld grit sort of way. Peter Berg is his supervising officer, and having always liked Berg, he reminds me why I keep track of his career. <br /> <br />It's been about half an hour after watching this film, and my heart is still pumping. If you thought Black Hawk Down was an intense movie, you have no idea what you are in for with Collateral. This makes Black Hawk Down seem like nothing short of a very loud and fast moving film in comparison, and Black Hawk Down is on my favorite DVD lists.  <br /> <br />I wish there was more I could say, but to be perfectly honest, I'm simply speechless and I am reminded why I never watch Michael Mann any later than the film's opening night in the theatres.
B0002VKZL6|5.0|Mark Knopfler is one of my favorite artists, a great guitarist, under-rated songwriter, and versatile.  This may be his most under-stated, easy listening album yet.  It really grows on you.  All the tracks are pleasing, several with searing lyrics.  Shangri-La, the track, is a great romantic tune to put on with the sun going and your honey next to you with wine and cheese.  A definite buy.
B00023B1LC|4.0|I was both excited and skeptical upon learning of the cast and crew for this film. Matt Damon would have been one of my top choices for Jason Bourne, but I never would have considered Doug Liman to direct this - a new up-and-coming director, so you could forgive me on that end.  <br /> <br />The Bourne Identity is incredibly solid. The visuals give us a very Cold War sense of the world and we see it through Jason's eyes - confusing, dangerous and at a number of times saddening. Damon does incredibly well using subtlety to understate his dual identities clashing with each other - his nature versus his training. However, Damon does not overact this and we are not hit over the head as many spy flicks have done in recent years (can you even call James Bond a spy flick anymore?).  <br /> <br />The plot is fast-paced, and while you can say there are holes in it, we find ourselves not processing what just happened and trying to see what's going to happen next. The SteadyCam is utilized in a number of scenes very well and I catch shades of Michael Mann in Liman's camerawork. The documentary-esque realism is very much alive in this film and I have to say that Liman is an excellent director. I am very excited to see what he's got going next.
B00008PX8P|5.0|Reviewer: dlusher from London United Kingdom   <br />This is simply an amazing release - it is everything DVD was tailored to do and the subject matter is important if you are interested at all in rock music. The sound is superb and the films are awesome. If you want to know why this band was so important and influential, and why they ruled the rock world, then buy this DVD, play it, gape and listen. I'll admit to being a Zeppelin fan (since the early 1970s), but it is to my great regret that I never saw them live. I've seen Plant & Page. I've actually met both gentlemen and they are fascinating people, but this DVD has filled an important gap in my life. Thank you Jimmy Page and others for doing such a marvellous job. I can't describe the music here - I could not do it justice. Just buy the release, listen and learn (particularly our younger readers who may have heard about this band in passing!). It's amazing that four people can make this music - what a voice, what guitar work, what musicianship, and my God - what a drummer! This IS the most important music release on DVD since the Beatles Anthology. Perhaps more so as most of the film has never been seen before. Simply stunning!  <br />
B0001NBMBC|5.0|First of all, to those spastic morons who think the song 'Circle' is by any chance 'pop', you should know that it's an 'acoustic' song. It's suppose to sound slow, it's a solo and played with an acoustic guitar and it's still rock. Learn something about music before you come to review it. And to those who this this album or any of the songs suck, why don't you go listen to your Dido album instead. If you had visited the slipknot website, you might have seen the slogan 'Forget everything you know' or something like that. This indicates Slipknot has something totally new and it's still kick-ass good. <br />Personally, I wasn't a hardcore Slipknot maggot. The new stuff really dragged me into their music and I love it all. <br /> <br />Whether or not you are into metal, I would strongly recommend this album. All of the songs in this album deserve a rating of 8 to 10 out of a scale of 10. I'd rate them as following: <br /> <br />1. Prelude 3.0 - 10/10  An excellent start to the album. Brilliant vocal and guitar. The slow drum really makes a good combination with the pace of the song. <br /> <br />2. The Blister Exists - 10/10  -  One of the best songs in the album. Brilliant vocal again, melodic, excellent drumming. and not to mention, James (the guitarist) is as always, magnificent. <br /> <br />3. Three Nil - 10/10  - Fairly paced, heavy, melodic, brilliant! This song will make ur head bang by itself! <br /> <br />4. Duality - 10/10  - Best song in the album in my opinion. Excellent guitar play by Mick and James, totally mind-blowing riffs! Clear and awesome vocal by corey, good drumming. This song is one of my most favourite metal songs. <br /> <br />5. Opium of people - 9/10 - Another heavy song, good drumming and guitar combination, fast paced. ACE! <br /> <br />6. Circle  - 10/10  - When I first listened to this song, I couldn't believe it was Slipknot. It was totally unexpected! Not only it was surprisingly good, corey taylor has again proved his talents and vocalskills if you have listened to 'Bother' which is a soundtrack of the film Spider-man. One of the best acoustic i have listened to. Brilliant lyrics. I love it! <br /> <br />7. Welcome - 10/10 - Excellent mosh pitt song. i can't help but headbang my brains out to it. .. well not exactly brains lol. But i must say this song is the heaviest of all in the album. It just gets better! <br /> <br />8. Vermillion - 10/10 - This is my second most favourite in the album. This vocal is brilliant. Good combi of drumming and guitar.  <br /> <br />9. Pulse of the Maggots  - 10/10  -  I'd say this song is a renewed version of old-school slipknot songs. Joey was awesome in the drums. Brilliant vocal again by corey. totally ace song. the credit goes to the entire slipknot crew. <br /> <br />10. Before I forget - 9/10  - Another heavy song, slightly less rhythmic, but noisy as it can get. Good vocal. <br /> <br />11. Vermillion part 2. - 10/10  - This is the acoustic version of Vermillion. Totally fantastic. I couldn't believe my ears or my maggot little brain if it was really slipknot when I first heard it. Corey taylor is talented man and he has really shut the critics up. <br /> <br />12. The Nameless - 9/10  - Superb song, heavy. Slow chorus, emotional. Slipknot sounds really different. There is a brilliant contrast between the old loathful slipknot and the new emotional Slipknot. Brilliant! <br /> <br />13. The virus of life - 8/10 -  Slow, unclear vocal, but totally new stuff. You'll still love this song. It's rythmic, yet metallic. I love it. <br /> <br />14. Danger- keep away  - 10/10  -  This song is f**king brilliant. An excellent ending track. The lyrics and vocal are emotional. It's even better than Iowa. <br /> <br />As a conclusion I have only one thing to say,  BUY THIS ALBUM! Don't be such a tight-a$$ about money because this album, the music, all of it is worth more. The more you listen to it the more you'll like it. And PLEASE, read the lyrics. They are awesome! <br /> <br />Enjoy maggots! \m/
0393035158|5.0|Sam Harris - thank you!  Finally I'm hearing - in words more eloquent and convincing than any I've been able to muster - exactly what I've been trying to explain for years to friends and family, that belief in God just doesn't make sense!  I've asked many believers and non-believers, among them some of the most admired, intelligent people I've known, to tell me WHY they believe in God.  In so many words, what I hear is \\"because\\".  Sounds like something Mom would say when you asked too many questions.  \\"Because I said so.\\"   <br /> <br />For me, the evidence all around us has always pointed clearly AWAY from any omnipotent, loving God so readily accepted by those following the Christian faith.  Call me simple, but would this \\"loving\\" God sacrifice his own son?  Would he - in all his omnipotence, allow the death of innocent people while murderes run free?  This is the part of the Christian argument that loses me first - I can't even get to the rest since this is such a key tenet of their belief.  Where's the logic, the common sense?    <br /> <br />Oh, and the whole bargaining thing makes me cringe - you can \\"everlasting life\\" in heaven if you just \\"believe\\".  How is it that Charles Manson can have a change of heart and become a believer with a front row seat in heaven, when I, having killed nothing larger than a fly, be sent away to burn for eternity because I don't?  Again, it just doesn't make sense but these seem to be the rules. <br /> <br />Well, as I began, my words are not the ones to listen to. Read this book if you have any interest at all in understanding why people \\"believe\\" and particularly, why they don't.
0800177975|5.0|WHAT IS HOLLYWOOD'S PROBLEM, ANYWAY? THIS IS THE GREATEST FILM EVER MADE. Okay, maybe I don't honestly believe that. Maybe \\"The Cable Guy\\" is a little bit better. Okay, maybe it's a toss-up. I can't decide. Oh, hell, never mind!    I guess what I'm getting at is I am damn sick and tired of listening to people rag this movie. I'm so sick of it, in fact, that I will outright lie through my teeth to people who dislike it and tell them that it is my favorite film, even though it really isn't. It isn't my favorite films of Arnold's by a long shot, but I still rank it in the top-ten. It isn't even one tenth as bad as they say it is. There were avid Schwarzenegger fans who actually came to loathe Arnold after he made this movie. Why, I ask? WHY? I DEMAND TO KNOW! Is it the acting? Is it the script? Is it the story and the premise? Special effects, car-chases, what? Okay, the acting is corny. I give you that. The story is far-fetched and the action is over-the-top. I give you that, too. But guess what, you stupid sh*ts? IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE THAT WAY! This film was intended as a social commentary. It is satire. It was intended to make fun of movies by example. It points out the most inherent flaw in all of cinema. Fantasy! That's right! It exposes the film industry for what it is. That is, a circus, a mad house, a rabid dog, a wild beast, a monolithic volcano of glamour, pretense, vanity, and and... AND just... shrill-shrieking-FRAUDS.     Okay, that's it then. I just answered my own question. The reason Hollywood holds such disdain for this film is simply because it does not like being the subject of such debates as morality and ethics. It's not like it is any big secret, though, that Hollywood is full of phonies, Satanists, (...)and demon worshipers. The world knew that years ago. It doesn't seem to hurt the grosses, though, does it? People keep seeing the movies. They keep watching television. They keep tuning into that political media circus that is the Oscars. Holly weird is clearly doing okay. So, why did this film scare them so? Don't ask me.     All I can tell you is that Arnold Schwarzeneger had to have a lot of balls to be in a movie like this. Especially when he was still a relative new comer to the acting profession and to America. But hey, it's just an action movie, and it's got a good plot.  Still, there seems to be no end to the contempt that film makers and critics have for Arnold. That isn't what pisses me off the most, though. What pisses me off the most is that the movie-going public could be so gullible and stupid as to accept whatever Hollywood tells them about a certain flick. Not critics, mind you. Nobody pays attention to critics anymore. Especially the stupid rich ones with their big thick books and their big thick mustaches. No, I'm talking about the entertainment industry, at large. Usually if every actor, every director, every producer, and every talk show personality gangs up on a certain individual, or a certain film and shouts at the top of their collective lungs \\"THIS PERSON'S WORK IS TERRIBLE. DO NOT WATCH THIS MOVIE,\\" everyone believes them. What these people should be yelling is \\"WE ARE FEARFUL. WE ARE JELOUS. WE WANT TO SEE THIS PERSON FAIL\\"  That's all entertainment is about. It's about one artist stabbing another in the back. It's not about teamwork anymore. Usually if enough people in the profession denounce a certain person's work, the rest of the world will think \\"Well, gee! Everybody in Hollywood thinks this movie sucks. It must be true. Well, I'm not going to waste my money\\"    That is why this film bombed. Not because of its quality or lack thereof, but because of quantity. That is, quantity of people in the business who SAID it wasn't any good. And the so called fans just like the toadying bunch of impressionable troglodytes and knuckle-draggers that they are, fell for it. They stayed away from the film in masses. And what do you think happened? Well, the film flopped of course. It is ArnoldScwarzenegger's most daring attempt at artistic genius and nobody went to see the ****ing thing. Well, let me tell you something. I DID SEE THE FILM, AND I LIKED IT! AND I'M NOT ALONE! But I'm sick of being made to feel like a doofus any time I defend this flick. I am tired of people laughing at me when I tell them that I am an Arnold Schwarzenegger fan, or a Jim Carrey fan, or a Norm Macdonald fan, or a Stephen King fan. I'm sick of it, and I won't stand for it. If anybody here needs to feel ashamed it is YOU POEPLE! I don't care what anybody says. So, you can all kiss my a$$ and go to hell. I love this movie, and I'll KILL ANYBODY WHO TRIES TO CHANGE MY MIND.     That being said, buy this DVD. It's certainly cheap enough (unfortunately for Arnold).
B00003CXA4|4.0|Although one person's view, this movie highlights Mohandas K. Gandhi's life and shows what struggles both India and Pakistan went through before their independences and how Gandhi was one man whose drive made it all happen. Stellar performances by both Ben Kingsley as well as Roshan Seth (who shows a remarkable resemblance to) and takes on the role of Jawaharlal Nehru. On the long side (at three hours+), but still definitely worth watching and adding to your collection.
B0002234LS|4.0|Perhaps Johnny Depp doesn't get enough credit as he really should with these kinds of roles (Ex. Blow and From Hell).  Johnny Depp is one of the greatest actors next to Tom Hanks and John Travolta, and this movie did not really get any real reviews except for the fact that it was from the interesting mind of Stephen King.  Johnny Depp is a schizophrenic who is traumatized after finding his wife with another man after she told him that she would never be with anyone else but him.  Johnny Depp (Morton Rainy) wrote a short story called \\"Secret Window\\" and it was about a guy named Todd Downey who had a wife that was obsessed with a garden she found through a hidden window behind a dresser in their new cabin.  He decides that he was going to kill her and bury her in the garden that she loved more than him.  Mort Rainy starts making up these characters in the movie, like John Shooter who, throughout the movie, accuses Mort of stealing his story.  In the end, Shooter and his inner-self get the best of him and he loses his mind as it was really him who commits these disturbing acts throughout the movie.  Depp ends up killing his wife (Shooter wants him to rewrite the ending he wrecked) and bury's her in the corn garden that he has in the back of his cabin.  Overall, I would give this movie 3 stars if I rated it in the box office.  It was a fresh start after Pirates Of The Carribean to see him with a layed back role as a depressed writer.  Johnny Depp is good to see in a role like this
B00005JNEI|5.0|Fahrenheit 9/11 is a perfect picture of the war in Iraq's effect on soldiers and their families, Iraqi civilians, U.S. society's perceptions, perceptions of the U.S., on and on.  Some people debate editing but it can't be more clear when a soldier denounces the war publicly and another soldier's mother reads a letter written by her son before he was killed stating his distaste for the reason they were in Iraq.  I went to see Michael speak in Florida and commend his perseverance to inform everyone of the truth and encourage them to vote in the upcoming November election.  You must see this movie no matter your political affiliation, at least in order for you to have both sides of the story.  Be informed!!  Hats off to you, Michael.
B00008J4P5|5.0|It is not the best album I've ever listened to, but, still, it is a fantastic album. Especially nowadays, when real rock is disappearing, and bands are simply commercial, the White Stripes should have their place in history, as the one band that brought rock'n roll back to life. And the amazing thing is that they make some incredible sound with only one electric guitar and drums most of the time! Meg plays just basic drums, but Jack does magic with that electric guitar. From remarkable riffs to slide and very original solos. And about the vocals, Jack White is not a great singer, but he has a style of his own, and some different kind of emotion in the way he speaks the words. They even have a version of a Burt Bacharach song! Isn't that something? And in this album, they go from hard rock, through romantic songs, to old western rythm. For saving good rock, they should be in the top rock bands' list, and Jack should be named th greatest musical genius of this generation.
B00005JNEI|1.0|What a joke. This documentary is full of lies and half truthes. Form the fake headlines that Michelle Moore used to the incorrect facts about ties between the Bin Laden family and the Bush family. This movie has one purpose-make people dislike Bush. I can't believe that a movie is going to help determine the outcome of a Presidential election. Michelle Moore will say anything to get people to dislike President Bush. Michelle Moore harasses people in all of his documentaries. Everyone is upset at the Swift Boat veterans for running the ads trying to discredit John Kerry. This piece of junk movie had the same purpose towards President Bush. I wish Americans would listen to the facts instead of listening to people like Michelle Moore, P. Diddy, Whoopi Goldberg, adn Dave Matthews. Watch this movie if you want, but don't belive anything you hear or see.............
B0002OERI0|3.0|Actually picked up this album based on strong word of mouth and some good reviews in the press, but overall am pretty disappointed. <br /> <br />I've always thought the whole \\"concept album\\" thing kind of dumb - and it doesn't work here either.  Actually, I can relate to the other reviewer's comments about \\"Billy (sic) Joe trying to deliver anti-imperialist songs is like Adam Sandler trying to do Shakespeare.\\"  Had a similar reaction myself.  Green Day trying to be \\"artsy,\\" intellectual, or profound comes off as rather silly.  Green Day should stick to what they do best: high octane Power-Pop and leave the concept albums to Pink Floyd. <br /> <br />To be sure, there's some good songs here, like \\"She's a Rebel.\\"  But this is simply an above-average release from one of contemporary Pop music's above-average bands. <br /> <br />Suppose I'll be attacked now for \\"being a Republican!\\" (which I'm not), because I'm not gushing over American Idiot.  But, I guess it gets the kiddies upset when you start knocking their precious Green Day...but seriously, its a diverse country people - not everyone might love Green Day or this album.  Deal with it. <br /> <br />So, in review, 3 Stars - not great - not terrible.
B00005JMJG|5.0|I loved the way this movie just washed over me and left me thinking about things -- life, love, Jim Carey -- in a slightly different, more complicated way. Not only does it peel back the skin of life to reveal a new view of human mating processes, but it's awfully pretty to look at: even if you're not in a thinking mood, the movie's easy on the eyes, dancing before you like the world's most luscious screensaver.
B00005QCVY|5.0|A brilliant movie - if this does not affect you emotionally, you may need help; like the reviewer below: \\"John Hancock vhspreowner\\" whose review (\\"it's a stupid movie\\") I couldn't believe, until I flipped through his other 20 pages of reviews and the guy hates EVERYTHING!! Haha ignore that sad person and purchase a beautiful movie which hits on the meaning and joy of life as much as anything I've seen or read. Jimmy Stewart is brilliant, and I love Donna Reed - the scene where they are on the phone together is incredibly moving (all the scenes are!!). In this new century where we seem to have lost touch with our hearts, you may need this to find your place again. I first caught this by accident on the TV back in the early 80's - I had never heard of it before - and I've watched it every year since. I also had the pleasure of seeing this on the big screen in Dec. 2002 and it was so great to share the movie with an audience, to hear everyone laugh together and to be part of the same experience, and also to notice little details like the glass skull Potter has on his desk - he is totally evil! But George Bailey would forgive even him in the end.  <br />It saddens me tho to realize that in a way our country has become Pottersville - Bedford Falls is gone, it seems. Oh well. That's why I watch the movie every winter - and I keep the kleenex nearby but only cuz it's cold out.
B00006690G|5.0|It does'nt matter what anyone thinks about eminem's music. He is a genious, and he will do anything to piss off the people that piss him off! This is his best album ever. Can't wait till the next is released.
B00005JNEI|4.0|As a polemic this is first rate stuff.  Moore has shaped a wonderful propaganda piece on Bush and the fallout of 9/11.  Of course, the movie doesn't bear up well under scrutiny, but that's not the point.  What Michael Moore has done is sound the alarm, and it is up to viewers to look closer at their commander in chief, and determine for themselves if he is \\"The Right Man.\\"<br /><br />Moore hits all the nerves in this movies, from those dumfounded minutes when Bush sat fixed in the elementary classroom to very poignant moments with a mother of one of the fallen soldiers in Iraq.  Moore makes his case for the Saudi connection: the unsavory ties with the bin Laden family, the charming Prince Banda who seems to have Bush's inner ear, and the seeming cover up of the Royal Family's role in all this.  He also goes after the Congressmen, in particular the Democrats, who voted for the war resolution, against what appeared to be their own better judgement.<br /><br />This movie will strike a chord with all those who have questioned the motivation of the Bush White House, and no doubt infuriate those who stand resolutely behind their Commander-in-Chief.  Moore is the modern day master of agit-prop.
0380789019|5.0|I never like to read storybooks..never read more than 10 decent storybooks in my whole life. The patience of reading thru a book few hundred pages thick just didn't apply to me. <br /> <br />However, things changed recently, when  my colleague introduced me to Neil Gaiman's 'Neverwhere'. Deciding to give reading a shot, I picked up the book - and couldn't put it down. Every page is griping - the words, the plot, the setting, the characters..everything. The idea of London Below is so surreal and unbelievably captivating. The scenes just played out in my head as I read..its almost like experiencing the journey myself. <br /> <br />Overall, an impactful and unbelievable story which will bring u joy, excitement, tears and endless nights of reading.
B00005JMH2|5.0|Do not see this film if you are a cynic and only want to see things \\"blowed up real good.\\"  Because it is always romantic and often sentimental in a sophisticated way.  Gere is excellent and has much verisimilitude in his portral of a man looking for something more in life.  I was worried that J.Lo's part would be underwritten, but not so.  Her three dance scenes are cool and erotic.
B00002MZ4W|5.0|LORD, I LOVE FIONA APPLE <br />SHE'S GREAT @ WHAT DOES <br />SHE REMINDS ME OF ALICIA <br />KEYS, SHE JUST HAS MORE <br />EMOTIONAL AND HER <br />SONGS HOLD SUBSTANCES <br />TO THEM.I GOT THIS  <br />ALBUM IN JULY, AND I'VE <br />BEEN PLAYING IT SINCE <br />GO SUPPORT FIONA APPLE!!!!!!!!!!!
B00005JNEI|4.0|First let me present myself, I spent 20 years in USMC and have my share of stories.  I was spit on by Americans while I was in uniform and have never trusted my government since Vietnam. <br /> <br />Moore presents truth and fiction in this movie, more truth then fiction though.  I cannot believe that the American public thinks it is unpatriotic to critize the Iraqi war and its conduct but this is the same people who see no wrong in how Bush and his administration have disobeyed their oaths of office, to whit:  I swear to protect the Constitution of the United States.  When you lock up Americans without due process you are violating their rights under the Constitution but Bush and his cronies dont give a damn as long as they get their money & power.  Then along comes Moore who attacks Bush and his conduct of the war.  I truly think that Moore was soft in his attack and had he really driven the point home could have awaken up some of the silent patriots who are scared to open their mouths against the government.  Speaking out is not unpatriotic, in fact it is patriotic to keep our government obeying the law.  To all of you out there who have no guts, you deserve the government you are not willing to fight for, that is how Germany went down the drain in the 30's.
B000099T2L|1.0|I LOVED THE ALBUM WHEN I FIRST GOT IT <br />NOW I HATE IT, THEY PLAYED HER OUT <br />ON THE RADIO, THE ONLY MEMORIABLE SONG <br />TO ME IS YES.SORRY,BEYONCE MAYBE NEXT TIME.
B00005JMUA|5.0|While I still marvel at the bloody, violent, chop-socky approach Tarantino took in Vol.1, the sprawling, sun-blessed, easily paced and beautifully acted Vol.2 is the perfect followup. No, the body count isn't as high in this second half, no the squirting geysers of blood aren't present this time around and yes, the dialouge (A Tarantino hallmark)is a dominant factor this time around, and that's the whole point! The story and the emotional payoff are what matters most, and they are handled brilliantly. The flashbance sequence; THE CRUEL TUTELAGE OF PAI MEI, is some of the most virtuostic filmmaking ever committed to celluoid and is worth the price of admission alone. The final showdown in the hotel room between the Bride and another assassin is classic Quentin and reminded of the dark tension and mood of his earlier films. Vol.2 is a work of stunning maturity and a major leap forward for the most gifted director of this generation.
B0001UL7RY|4.0|NICE FOLLOW-UP, I PLAY IT MORE THAN I PLAYED THE FIRST ALBUM <br />I LIKE ALL THE MATERIAL ON THIS ALBUM, GO SUPPORT AVRIL IF YOU DONT ALREADY HAVE IT.
B00005JNEI|4.0|All footage in the film was a condensed version   of what we all saw in the media over the last   few years but never paid attention.    I wish Moore would have investigated flight 93   which may have been shot down over Penn. by manned   or unmanned USAF before heading to the White House,  (...)     -Then Bush turns \\"lets's roll\\" propoganda   from what somebody \\"said\\" on a puney cell   phone to some wife as he \\"attacked the terrorists-   when U.S. was vulnerable. [...]   Moore didn't touch on the subject at all.    It looks as if amazon is even on the move   with the patriot act as one can not have an   alias when reviewing books. Makes it easier   for the feds to get a psych profile: what books   people browse, etc, etc.  (...)    -in order to understand how Bush's belief system   blended with U.S. megolomania could bring the   end of the world within 10 yrs.    The Bush admin is becoming like the   Watchtower Organization, refusing to acknowledge they were   wrong in the past,and becoming totalist.    In order to protect the freedoms that the terrorists are trying to destroy, we must limit them.
B000002BE9|4.0|THE ALBUM IS GOOD <br />IT'S JUST A LITTLE <br />TO POPPY, I LOVE <br />HER SECOND ALBUM <br />TOUGH.THIS ALBUM <br />IS GOOD IT JUST  <br />HASNT GROWN ON <br />ME YET, LIKE THE  <br />SECOND ALBUM <br />I WONT WRITE THE  <br />FIRST ALBUM OFF, <br />JUST YET.I'LL GIVE IT <br />ANOTHER CHANCE.
B0002OERI0|5.0|On this album, GreenDay proves again they can do whatever they want the can play whatever they want and sing whatever they want. The situation of the united states, has made us think of what the goverment wants, people need to listen; music communicates, GreenDay has proved they can do that. Their songs are more than silly jokes and stuff about their lifes (not that I'm saying i don't like em, all their albums are awesome). The songs on the album are just excellent, there's no song you want to skip, you want to listen to all the album from song 1 to 13. Billie, Tre and Mike, you're great musicians/song writters I hope we can still have more GreenDay for many years.
B0001UL7RY|5.0|Sorry. I can't write these stupid amazon titles!   <br />Well I'm a pretty big fan of Avril. Almost everybody in my school(girls, that is. I'm a girl) enjoys her music. I liked this CD, as it is more of a mix of rock, punk, and pop. I really like hardcore rock(Led Zeppelin for example), but gimme a break, I'm a girl. I need some refreshment from 'YYYYYYYYYYYYYYYEEEEEEAAAAAAAHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!'   male screams in my ear. Although Avril says she's like this big punk girl, in reality her CDs are just made up of fun upbeat catchy tunes. Not like I have a problem with that!  First is 'Take me Away'. Pretty good song, though the lyrics are basically the same as dozens of her other songs, all about boys who hurt her emotionally. Next comes 'Together'.  It's alright, definitely not my favorite. Next, 'Don't Tell Me'. It sends a very good message to teen girls, though I'm not gonna sit here explaining it. this is long enough already without telling you the lyrics of one song. <br />Next, 'He Wasn't'. This is a perfect example of how Avril is not a punk rocker. It's a upbeat song that makes me wanna get up and dance. I'm serious. But I love it anyway! #5- How Does it Feel- A wonderful heartfelt song. I just like lying on my bed and listening  to the wonderful vocals and lyrics. very un-punk though! 6 is My happy ending. I've heard this SO many times on VH1's Top 20 music video countdown. Very catchy and fast-paced, though you can only listen to it so many times. 7 is Nobody's Home. This is possibly one of the most pessimistic songs i've ever heard. 'she wants to go home, but nobody's home. its where she lies, broken inside. no place to go to dry her eyes, broken inside'  Very good vocals though! 8 is Forgotten. More  'Boys stink. I cannot get a successful relationship so I'm running away.' 9 is Who Knows. I love this. It's very nice and is the only song on this CD that sends an extremely positive message. 'I think there's something more life's worth living for. Who knows whatcould happen, do what you do just keep on laughing, tomorrow's a brand new day' This is the most hypocritical non-punk  totally pop song I've ever heard, but it's so cool! I dance to this one, I must admit it. 10 is Fall to Pieces. What a sweet song! love triumphs over all. 11 is Freak Out. I don't really like the music or the lyrics, except for this one part- 'You don't always have to do everything right, stand up for yourself and put up a fight' 12, Slipped Away, is obviously the most from-the-heart song. It was dedicated to her grandpa who passed away a while ago. The lyrics clearly express her her love and grief for her grandpa. As I have not had a loved person die yet and would not know what it feels like, a good friend of mine's little brother passed away when she was in 1st grade and he a toddler. she loved this song, and I imagine cried over it. Well there you go. In conclusion(ha im writing a report for school!), this has proved that avril is NOT a hard-rocker as she says she is, but I still liked this new catchy tune to her songs. Finally it seems she isn't simply just doing what the record company tells her to do.
0060254920|5.0|While going about My nightly activities, I came upon this delightful hard-cover book and it brought forth an evocation: I remember reading this book in 5th grade when I found it in the school library during a break from My Safety Committee duties - the cover really drew Me in - and though the story was intended for previous gradation, I enjoyed it for its charming simplicity and the adventure of Max, who likes to dress up like a white wolf who used his imagination to fashion his own little total environment in his room, and effectively turns it into a dark jungle for himself, and thus embarks upon a journey that will bring him into the darkest recesses of his imagination, as he visits an island \\"where the wild things are\\", which are various projections of himself in the lycanthropic state - veritable Satanimal-like forest demons resembling some of the classic features from demonological arcana - werebeasts all {note the humanoid feet and general mannerisms}, who in the beginning, try to scare him, but he ends up becoming their king, and they show him homage as King of all Wild Things, ruling with sceptor and crown. So they romp together under the full moon, hang from trees, and parade through the glades in a joyous fanfare, until little Max gets a bit bored and longs for something good to eat, and sets off back to his room across the sea again \\"for over a year\\", finding his hot supper waiting for him.<br /><br />It can be seen now that this was but a dream, as he took a famished nap, after having earlier run about the house chasing the family dog and constructing his room to specification with utmost imagination, fading into a nap sometime in the process. I suppose mom could not allow him to starve, so after sending him to his room to ruminate over a comment he made about eating her up, he awakens from his nap and is welcomed back to the table.
B00005JNEI|5.0|This is the finest piece of work within the past century.  Not only factual and informative, this film highlights some of the basic issues within our society: deception, greed, etc.  If only our culture could get past the Republican mindset and work toward a more caring, compassionate approach to all...
B000255LNE|5.0|I picked up the CD the day it came out.  Being a big fan for many years now, I figured I had to have a copy! <br />The first track, \\"Tearin' and Breakin' \\"  was a welcome change so to speak for Phil....the song starts off with vocal harmonies that literally blow you away....It is then accented with soft piano and a beautiful horn solo.  Truly a great song....one I already love. <br /> <br />The album has quite a few of the \\"no brainers\\" : Against All Odds, Groovy Kind Of Love, One More Night, just to name a few. But, then there are the surprises: Can't Turn Back the Years, I've Forgotten Everything, Least You Can Do, and many more.  The fact that some lesser \\"known\\" songs are in the CD makes it that much more gratifying for me as alot of these \\"surprises\\" are some of my personal favorites I thought nobody else liked since they didn't go \\"mainstream\\". <br /> <br />If you like Phils voice and the way he writes/sings...this is a MUST have.....It has songs for all occasions....weddings/breakups/SEX! <br /> <br />Thx for reading, <br />Jeff
B00005JNEI|5.0|Doesn't matter what you think of Michael Moore. He is annoyed by politicians, and really cares about America.I'm not going to rehash the developments, which are smartly and coherently presented. This film has heart, humor, and sincerity. Do NOT judge this film until you've seen it. Whether you agree with it or not, it's certainly eye-opening. Keep your mind open. I'm very impressed. Every American should see this film. However, it's presumptuous of Mr. Moore to withdraw from the Documentary category for consideration for Best Picture. Dumb move.
B00008PX8P|5.0|I mean, why even bother posting reviews for this? We all (and when I say \\"we all\\", I mean \\"we who have a clue\\") know it's one of the most satisfying musical purchases since...well, EVER. Everyone's got their own favorite segments (mine is the Earls Court footage...never get tired of the \\"In My Time Of Dying\\" and \\"Trampled Underfoot\\" one-two punch), but regardless, you can toss the remote control aside & watch it all the way through. The audio is mindblowing...if you didn't know any better, you'd have thought alot of it was recorded last WEEK, never mind 25+ years ago. Visually, it varies (of course, b/c the performances were pulled from various concerts & eras), but painstaking efforts were made to deliver a very impressive cleaned-up finished product. So chalk up another 5-star review from another proud owner. And if you don't already own this, what's the holdup??
B000002HJA|5.0|I love this $#%@ record, the best that Kyuss probably did.
B0002KQNJU|5.0|I first saw this film in its truncated version redubbed with the inclusion of a short animated cartoon.  It wasn't until years later I saw Polanski's original cut, which took me many years to realize how superior it was.  The problem was I had gotten used to the dubbed voices and the additional sound effects added by MGM supervising editor Margaret Booth.  This annoying reworking was blamed for many years on Martin Ransohoff, who according to DVD Savant, was on good terms with Polanski.  Yet, after getting used to the original version, I cannot go back to the Booth version, which now just seems overdone.  People have criticized this film as being slow and not funny or not scary, but I beg to differ.  The humor ranges from burlesque to dark, and the overall effect of the film is more like a horror fairy tale than a really scary tour-de-force like Polanski's early Repulsion.  What sticks with me the most about this film, however, is the wonderful atmosphere.  The whole opening sequence in the Inn recalls Dracula, Horror of Dracula, Brides of Dracula, Vampyr and Nosferatu.  In fact, it appears Polanski based the Professor Abronsius character on the doctor from Carl Dreyer's Vampyr, and Polanski's Alfred character on the young Hutter from F. W. Murnau's Nosferatu.  Polanski even wears the same style hat. Christopher Komeda's score perfectly suits the mood, creepy and slightly over the top.  And finally, Sharon Tate looked absolutely stunning.  My only complaint about the DVD (which looks good and IS the Polanski version) is why such a skimpy collection of extras?  I'm sure there are many critics who would have loved to add a commentary to this film.
B00004D3C1|5.0|A bunch of classics songs like King of the road, hell on wheels and weird beard. Fu manchu remains the last real good hard rock band around.
6305428042|5.0|I have yet to get this on DVD, but have had it on VHS for years.  I have watched it so much it is wearing out.  This is a great movie for anyone who loves Halloween at any age.  Personally, I don't care for singing in movies, but this movie is an exception as the only song in it is great!  It doesn't seem like Halloween around here until I see this movie two or three times.  Forget the bad reviews... this movie is great!
B00005JNEI|1.0|Hard to believe so many fell for it!!  One has to lament the fact that Michael Moore, by shamelessly wrapping himself in the mantle of liberal ideology, will always enjoy the support of people who share his views no matter how mediocre his output is. This ridiculous movie is popular in France...need I say more?
B00005JNEI|5.0|Michael Moore has built a very convincing case against the President.   After seeing this film I am offended that the Media (the \\"watchdogs of society\\") are lying to us.   They won't show us the truth.   I am a changed person now. Now I know that I need to get my news from more quality sources instead of the cheap news they show every night. <br /> <br />How can any Bush supporter watch this movie & feel confident over the cozy relationship between the Bush family and the Saudi Royals?   <br /> <br />Moore's research is thorough.  If it wasn't, I would be embarrassed for him.  Instead I am proud.
B00005JMUA|4.0|It would be close to impossible to top \\"Vol. 1\\" in the gore / action department, and fortunately Q didn't try.  In Vol. 2 we get much more character development and the violence is less physical than psychological (e.g., discussing with your daughter in childlike language how you shot her mother in the head).  All in all, two great movies well worth full price.<br /><br />My only complaint is the classic \\"Don't mess around with your victim when you have her down; kill her immediately like anyone with an ounce of common sense would\\" complaint that is common to the genre.  But then again, maybe this wasn't clich&eacute;d writing by Q, but rather deliberate homage.  With Q, who can tell the difference?
B0002OERI0|5.0|I am 36 years old, and have been a music freak since age 10. I have experienced many great new releases (X)(Beastie Boys) (Pretenders)(Dead Kennedys), etc..this is the best thing I've heard in 10 years. I have much respect for these guys and the message they're putting across. It is not that it is so original, because a true music fan will recognize lots of similarities to other types of songs (it took a lot for me to get past one of the choruses in Jesus of Suburbia, because it was all way too close to Brian Adams' Summer of '69 which I can't stand that guy..there's even a little Motley Crue reminicent vocal line in that same part, which probably was influenced by T-Rex, and so on..so whatever)..but you know what, it works, and they DID it. Also, the drummer is amazing, just so solid and right on through the entire cd. I never buy any new cd's, always go to my local used shop..but out of respect for the band, after hearing this at a friend's house, I purchased it new. I have no regrets. It is a fine piece of work all the way through. Excellent job!
B00005JNEI|5.0|This movie opens our eyes and sharpens our ears. It's hard to imagine that our own elected president is dishonest and puts interests of a few above those of millions here and in Iraq. I have my great respect for Michael Moore who dares to speak up and reveals all the interesting (but seldom discussed or deliberately suppressed) issues surrounding 9/11 and the Iraqi war. I don't find the movie overly biased at all. It presents the issues in a plain factual manner. Everyone should watch this movie, analyze the facts and make his/her own conclusions.
B0000027RL|1.0|this is the worst piece of crap ever.  i HATE pearl jam. they are complete poseurs off of nirvana and soundgarden. they are so bad i cant even explain. the guitars sound like a baby crying, and eddie vedder's voice sounds like....well it sounds like a baby cry as well. if you want REAL grunge, check out stone temple pilots, nirvana, soundgarden, alice in chains, and default. DOWN WITH PEARL HAM!
B00027JYLC|5.0|This is a marvelous movie, but it has had a hard time really gaining true respect because it did what so few films really did - removed the safety net from viewers.  In every horror film, the movie goers had that \\"net\\" of saying to themselves, no matter how horrific the film was, \\"this is only make-believe\\".  One loses that in the provoking film by Tod Browning (who directed Lugosi in the original Dracula).  This is really uncharted territory, (though Nightmare Alley with Tyron Power, 1947 walked into this realm very effectively), the lives of the Circus Freaks.  By today's standard it's still having a hard time gaining respect in the politically correct consciousness where we would blanche at calling any human a freak.<br /><br />Still, Browning's tale is haunting, mermerizing.  It's a story of love, betrayal and the ultimate retribution acted out by the circus freaks themselves in an eye for an eye justice.  Evil trapeze artist, Olga Baclanova deliberately sets out to seduce and marry a midget in the circus sideshow, with a wicked eye on getting his money.  However, the perfectly gorgeous Olga has crossed the line with the tightly knit community of the very human and compassionate - just different - sideshow artists.  These people use their \\"differences\\" to make a living in the world.  They endure the harsh treatment and laughter at their expense, but they have a very supportive code amongst themselves.  And for Olga to see the little man as an easy target and cause his death, it is beyond the pale to them.  The sideshow people are a family, a clan, and when you do something to one of them, you do it to all of them.<br /><br />Browning set out with a very provocative premise - frankly, I am still amazed after all these years the film was made - because Browning did not go for the more \\"acceptable\\" sideshow denizens, he went for the most famous of the era.  It was a move that very nearly cost him his career.  And that is where the viewer loses the safety net.  This is real people displaying their sad and strange peculiarities.  This film is disturbing on so many levels, holds up a mirror to the audiences faces, and possibly makes them face their own emotions with which we are not too comfortable.  In Great Britain the film was banned for over 30 years.<br /><br />The film is still potent, still brilliant, still holding up mirrors making us examine very uncomfortable prejudices and emotions.  It's a masterpiece, everything Browning set out to make it realized.  It's just moving, visionary, just often not an easy experience.is real people displaying their sad and strange peculiarities.

B00005JNEI|5.0|Most important movie ever made?   <br />Don't laugh, its possible! <br />Any claims that this movie exadurates or misrepresents truth are not at all surprising, as we Americans have become so used to being fed propaganda  from the right. <br />Reclaim American democracy on Nov.2, and let history start recording truth about the Bush Dynasty and its near successes in redesigning our country into a corporation that they own.
B00005JNEI|4.0|Fahrinheit 9/11 did not just keep my attention the whole way threw. It did the unthinkable it showed information on the president that i thought myself would have completely exploited him at all costs. But i admire Micheal Moore for not just dilivering a greatly entertaining film but also showing us what we need to see and here. There are many people, who are against Micheal Moore and in some ways i have been and still am. But the irony is that people will make up there minds of this film before they even seeing it. I know because i did the same. But after seeing the film i know that Micheal Moore has made a movie that is not entirely untrue, though he takes some trueths and twists them in key areas so that they stay true in fact, but the people and media get the wrong idea. But the accually  gist of it is that about 90% of this film is accually facts and untwisted facts. The movie dos have some problems though sometimes the music will overshadow the over all sounds and fell of the events takeing place at the time in the movie and though you really want to pay attention to the film. You cant because this problem becomes too anoiying. Though i only found this to be a problem for about the first 20 minutes of the film. <br />The movie is also verry violent in some seens and shows some verry raw and gritty images of the fight in ireaq, after seeing these seens of creul and violent nature (which also adds in some at times unnessessary language) there really is no reason to heed the film R rating like some of the media is trying to do. The conent alone should grant this and R rating. In the end Micheal Moore has made an acceptionally good movie, that will be the hype of conversations, leading up to the upcoming ellection.
B000062YAZ|3.0|I am a 'first-timer' listening to Slayer, they're really good at the guitar and drums, and i like the composition of their songs, but I am a christian, and i don't really appreciate the whole death/satan thing with a penticle on the front of the CD. But aside from that, the Slayer CD's 'South Of Heaven' and 'Reign In Blood' are really good, and i think i'll pick up some tabs on some of their songs and try to play it. It's awesome, but I do not recommend it because I don't like their lyrics. Their Songs are completely awesome..(and i know i'm gonna get crucified for saying this...but) their Lyrics SUCK! I like Alt Rock, Hard Rock, And Heavy Metal, including Soulfly and Slipknot...and they're good too, I have 857 CD's and I have a wide variety of music, so I know what I'm talking about when i am giving a review. To make this review more 'friendly' to those people who just got offended by what i said above: <br /> <br />This CD is great, it has awesome guitar riffs and drum segments, the solo's are not at all bad, they are great too, the heavyness of the music is tolerable by people who listen to the real heavy stuff all of the time, otherwise it will get boring and sound the same after the 4th track. All of their songs talk about death and satan and if you haven't noticed already, there IS a pentigram on the front of the CD for any wiccans and satanists reading this. The Music is great, but the lyrics suffer tremendously, I recommend this CD the non-christians, or christians that don't give a F _ ck. I rate this CD 3 stars for so-so. The best review that i can give you is download a few tracks from KaZaA Lite and decide for yourself whether it is worth getting.
B0002IU988|4.0|The new singer recruited for Tremonti and his former Creed mates, is former Mayfield Four vocalist Myles Kennedy. I know your first question, \\"Does he sound like Scott Stapp?\\" - well, ...yes. Kennedy is probably a more technically trained singer though, exhibiting tremendous strength, passion and tone here. Being a fan of Stapp and his extraordinary high palette vocal tone, I had my doubts about a replacement. Myles Kennedy has since eradicated any doubts that I may have had. This is a real professional. A pure voice. This record isn't really about who sings the songs, though.<br /><br />  Tremonti's writing style is one that places you on top of the highest mountain. There is great build up to most of these songs. Each melody is written with accompanying lyrics that simply soar. Creed was sometimes called a \\"spiritual\\" or even religious band. The reason for that assumption was not simply inspired by the usually positive lyrics. The ascending melodies, along with soulful and passionate performances, were simply inspirational in the way that they were delivered to the listener. The Alter Bridge material is no different. These songs, primarily written by Tremonti, have the same \\"triumphant\\" vibe to them. They make you feel stronger when you sing along to them. They reach inside of you and move you, heart and soul. Even a bad singer could put these well crafted tunes over. With a singer like Myles Kennedy at the helm, things get magical.<br /><br />  Tremonti has a real talent for writing complete songs; songs that are not only \\"catchy\\" and instrumentally powerful, but songs that are lyrically strong also. When the lyrics of \\"You're a part of me, And it's your song that sets me free, I sing it while I feel I can't hold on, I sing tonight, 'Cause it comforts me\\" from \\"In Loving Memory\\" are sung, you feel like you have just received a piece of Tremonti's soul. The lyrics are really nothing too amazing; but in the context of the sensitive melody, and the gentle vocal tone - they become deep and genuine. In \\"Burn It Down\\", which is probably the strongest song vocally, the lyrics \\"Hard to tell my nights now from my days, The curtains hide my feelings, Don't feel I have any right to pray, And will they find me someday\\" are delivered with a strength rarely found in the current crop of rock songs.<br /><br />  Dare I say, Mark Tremonti's guitar style is much like that of guitar legends such as Brian May, or Boston's Tom Scholz. Each of them has a very distinct sound and tone. When you hear each of them play, you know immediately who it is. Tremonti's sound takes on a personality all its own also. No matter what band Mark Tremonti plays in, his guitar sound is going to shine through and become the core of the songs' melodies. On songs like \\"Open Your Eyes\\", \\"Shed My Skin\\", and \\"Down To My Last\\" the sound and structure is immediately recognizable. They sound like Creed songs, when in fact they are all mere examples of Mark Tremonti's talent with both the pen and the pick. Listen to Myles Kennedy cry out these lyrics from the chorus of \\"Broken Wings\\", possibly the record's strongest track, and try not to get chills: \\"On broken wings I'm falling, And it won't be long, The skin on me is burning, By the fires of the sun, On skinned knees I'm bleeding, And it won't be long, I've got to find that meaning, I'll search for so long\\". These songs are all finely textured and serious songwriting achievements. You can count on a variety of tempos here also. We have the mellow to heavy formula (\\"Burn It Down\\"), we have the straight forward power ballad (\\"In Loving Memory\\"), and we have the hard hitting metal grind (\\"Watch Your Words\\"). This record has it all.<br /><br />  So, you ask, is this a perfect 10? No, it isn't. I must tell you though, it is very close. The title track, and \\"Watch Your Words\\" are songs that I might skip over occasionally; not because they aren't great songs, but they just don't always yearn to be heard like the rest of this record. Make no mistake though, this is a great one.<br /><br />OVERALL RATING:  8<br /><br />For more Dr. Music reviews, visit [...]of this record.

B000002KKS|5.0|Released in 1980, after the departure of legendary frontman Ozzy Osbourne, \\"Heaven And Hell\\" was a release that thrilled and shocked an entire legion of Sabbath fans throughout the world. With Ronnie James Dio bringing his masterful lyrics, along with his iron-clad pipes into the mix, Black Sabbath reached areas that they had never ventured to on previous recordings. Keeping the ominous feel of Sabbath past, they incorporated some lyrical diversity and, arguably, a stronger voice to sing them. Dio is literally the \\"The Mouse That Roared\\". With a stature of just over five feet, and a voice that can slay dragons, he is pure elfin magic here.<br /><br />  Black Sabbath was at a crossroads similar to that of AC/DC when they lost their great lead singer, Bon Scott, to an alcohol overdose in 1979. AC/DC hired Brian Johnson to replace Scott, and to the astonishment of millions of fans, they cut a little record called \\"Back In Black\\". Black Sabbath hired Dio and gave us this gem. This is Sabbath's \\"Back In Black\\". When you saw an influential and enigmatic frontman like Ozzy Osbourne leave the fold, you truly wondered if the band could survive such a devastating blow. While Sabbath was creating an entire genre of dark metal music practically single handed, Osbourne was the man at the front of that movement. Oceans of fans throughout the world proceeded to peg the band as dead the minute Ozzy decided to leave the band, but little did they realize.......they had buried the mighty Sabbath very much alive.<br /><br />  For years, Ronnie James Dio had been acknowledged as one of the most powerful voices in rock 'n' roll. Droves of rabid fans were set to eat Mr. Dio alive. \\"We are loyal to Ozzy and no one else\\", was the feeling of many a Sabbath fan. Well, it was, ...until they heard these songs.<br /><br />  \\"Heaven And Hell\\" is a record that stays true to the Sabbath form. Dark and brooding overtones, mixed with extraordinary guitar pieces being supplied by guitarist Tony Iommi. The rhythm section of drummer Bill Ward and bassist Geezer Butler remains intact, and a constant force throughout the record also. It is with the addition of Dio that we get the added extras, though. This album's back alleys are littered with lyrical passages that make your head spin; and they all get swept away by Dio's resonating vocals. His delivery of this brilliant self-penned prose is right on the mark. When we hear the tender tones of \\"Children Of The Sea\\" turn to a vicious attack, or when we hear the thunderous rhythm of the title track, we realize that these songs become complete when we hear the lyrics.<br /><br />  The intensity of the opening track, \\"Neon Knights\\", was an instant message to millions of doubtful fans, that Black Sabbath was going to remain a visceral, vibrant, and influential force in the heavy metal genre. Sabbath defied the odds here, and delivered one of the best records of their illustrious career. Die hard Ozzy/Sabbath fans, like myself, often declare this record as one of Sabbath's best - and that is an amazing thing.<br /><br />For more Dr. Music reviews, visit [...]Tony Iommi.

B0002VKZL6|3.0|Shangri-La is perhaps the SLOWEST Mark Knopfler album since leaving Dire Straits. Please bear in mind that I'm a HUGE MK fan. I'd pay money to see him clean chalkboards. He wouldn't even have to play guitar. Perhaps that is what he had in mind when sleeping his way through the tracks on this CD? MK has forgotten that he is an extraordinary Lead Guitarist and that is why we've been fans for so long. On Shangri-La, he does little more than MK noodlings--the kind of thing that could be heard in the slower sections of any other MK CD. While I generally applaud Mark's fascination with American Roots music, he seems to have forgotten that he owns an amplifier and a herd of effects pedals. A prior editorial review listed prominantly here describes this as MK's most rocking album since leaving Dire Straits. It scares me how close to death the reviewer must have been to perceive that this album rocks. It does not. There is no powerful guitar as found on Sailing to Philadelphia. There is no drama as found on Screen Playing. There is only noodling, that dare I say it, I could probably play with a few hours of practice.    Now that we've established that there is no rock here. Let's look at it in its proper place: Adult Easy Listening. This is a mellow CD, suitable for a quiet dinner with the spouse or long-time girlfriend. It is the perfect album to put on as you are trying to unwind from a busy day and don't mind if you pass out in the middle of track 7 and wake up with a puddle of drool on the liner notes. But make sure you have Sailing to Philadelphia in the changer behind this one or you might not wake up in time to go to work in the morning. \\"What it Is\\" rocks harder than any 6 songs on this CD combined.    All in all, if you are looking for a Slow Motion Mark Knopfler, this is your disc. It will grow on you after 4 or 5 listenings, but if you are longing for even a small taste of the Mark Knopfler you fell in love with in Dire Straits, perhaps you are better off spendingyour money elsewhere.
B00003CX5P|5.0|This movie get's better and better every time I watch it. The first time I saw it in theather's I was a bit confused and was not sure if I liked it or not. Then I went the next week and that time I got it. Since Darth Vader is my favorite character of the star wars saga, I love to see his story of when he was young. Plus this movie made me become a big fan of Obi won kanobi. Thank god for George Lucas
B0000AQS0F|4.0|The mind boggles at the thought processes of Fox Network Executives.  The opening two hours of this series is a fantastic, intriguing. compelling launch in to the world of the crew of Serenity.  The second episode is a rather lack-lustre, pedestrian, formulaic and unintriguing follow up episode to the arresting opening two hours.  And the bozos at Fox decided to open the series with this second episode rather than the dedicated introductory telemovie.  No wonder viewers who sampled the show on opening night were not hooked.  After I viewed the opening telemovie I was a convert.  After the second episode I felt totally indifferent, but due to having seen the opening telemovie was intent on persevering on to the better later episodes.  If I had seen only that second episode as an introduction, there is no way I'd have bothered to sample the show again.  Also, without the set-up of the telemovie, the second episode as an opener must have been very confusing to viewers.  How did these lame brains who made this decision get their jobs?.  This decision must have broken Joss Weedon's heart.  A man of his creative skill at the whim and caprice of such know nothing fools.  Hollywood is truly a strange place.
B0002O7XW2|4.0|Christine is something of a curious anomaly in John Carpenter's career. It isn't as beloved by his fans as, say, Escape from New York and it isn't as crappy as Memoirs of an Invisible Man. It is, however, one of the better Stephen King adaptations-which isn't saying much when you consider how many lousy ones there are out there. A previous, bare bones DVD was released awhile ago. Now, a new special edition with Carpenter's participation is out.<br /><br />A treat for Carpenter fans is the audio commentary by the director and the film's star, Keith Gordon. It's great to hear two directors talk about their craft. . It's a trip down memory lane for both men who joke and remember all sorts of good anecdotes in this relaxed and entertaining track.<br /><br />There are 20 deleted scenes, most of which are not very long in length and, in most cases, were rightly cut. They flesh out the characters a bit more and show the demise of minor characters.<br /><br />\\"Christine: Fast and Furious\\" examines the themes and story of the movie with new interviews with Carpenter, Gordon, John Stockwell and Alexandra Paul.<br /><br />\\"Christine: Finish Line\\" examines the use of music in the movie. Also included in this featurette is how the cast and crew view the film now that twenty years has passed.<br /><br />\\"Christine: Ignition\\" features the film's screenwriter, Bill Phillips, talking about how he adapted King's novel. He and Carpenter talk about the changes that they made from King's novel to make it more cinematic.<br /><br />Christine is good film, not a great one, but definitely one of the better King adaptations because it was made by a director with a distinctive style and vision. In many respects it is not a conventional horror film. There is very little gore or traditional scares. It's more of a mood or an unsettling feeling. Fans of Carpenter will enjoy this DVD for Carpenter's excellent commentary track. This new special edition is a definite improvement over the older one and well worth picking up.e older one and well worth picking up.
B00005JNEI|5.0|An appalling look at our system, the system we trust to be run in the up most professional manner.  Watching this movie changed everything for me, and I felt privileged to have been shown the flaws in our government.  Bush is an idiot.  I cant help it, I tried to keep an open mind, I knew that Michael Moore would portray him in the worst way possible.  Still however, I found myself stunned by the things I was seeing, I couldn't believe my eyes or ears. 90% of the movie's stunning information is given by the actual people in question, so you don't have to second guess the film, there's no room for questioning.  Michael lays everything down right there in your lap and lets you feel the way you would naturally feel without trying to manipulate the viewer into thinking his way.  That's what people need to understand about this film. This is not a film for democrats, blacks, poor people or any one particular audience.  It is for the American people and America needs to wake up...stop saying things like \\"im not supporting that pig while he puts my great country down\\"  Michael is not putting our country down in this film...our president does the job quite well enough. If you are one of these people--you are mislead--plain and simple.  I urge you to open your mind for a minute and see what is really going on, and stop letting your political preference stop you.  Most of the people that need to see this movie unfortunately will never see it and will end up voting for that moron again and let America keep washing down the drain. When you are finished watching the movie, you can watch some of the special features which are also GREAT! Especially the one with Bush after meeting with the 9/11 Commission he LIES like a dog you can read it on his face.  That needed to be in the movie in my opinion!  And Condoleeza Rice's testimony is a good laugh too.  The administration is so incompetent you wont believe it.  One thing is for sure, don't miss this opportunity because you will NEVER see anything like this on TV. And another thing I don't know ANYONE republican or democrat who has watched this film and can honestly say that they think Bush is the one for the job and we are going in the right direction.  Hey maybe Kerry isn't the one either but what do we have to lose look at the situation as it stands 4 years later. Check out this film and you will agree I guarantee it. I have never seen a movie that charged me up emotionally the way this did, you cant afford not to \\"experience\\" F9/11. Peace and love to all my fellow Americans.
B0000C9ZLD|5.0|No joke, The Strokes are the real thing, and ROOM ON FIRE is subtle, magical music.  Themes and motifs cycle throughout their songs and throughout the entire CD to make this not only one of the best CDs of last year but also of this year.  I know on first hearing it may not seem as good as their debut, but like all great music, it must be heard again and again, and appreciation for little things will come.  I know some will scoff at my comparison to the Beatles.  Obviously, The Strokes don't have the breadth and range of music yet, and may never, in fact probably may never, but if you're honest and don't jump on the band wagon with all their jealous detractors and will trust your own ears, you will hear beautiful Beatlesque melodies as complex as they are simple, and you will hear the smartest, most sardonic lyrics around, since the Beatles.
B00003CX5P|5.0|What more can I say exept this was a classic film. A masterpiece in so many ways I still don't fully comprehend how marvelous this film is. I loved it.
B00008S2VG|4.0|Panned by critics, 'American Life' was the wrong album at the wrong time.  Over the years Madonna's message and heartfelt lyrics have been overshadowed by her image.  The AL video, and war images overtook what is a pretty great album.  American Life is another example of some great lyrical content which was overlooked by the general public.  Ok, so it was a stretch for her to rap about driving her mini cooper while feeling super dooper, but I digress.  Listen to \\"Nothing Fails\\", \\"Xstatic Process\\", or \\"Mother and Father\\".  Deep, meaniningful, and thoughtful. Then there is the dancy \\"Nobody Knows Me\\" which has a great beat.  Overall, not her best work, but still original Madonna.  CHECK IT OUT....
B00005JNEI|5.0|For all the controversy surrounding this film, the point is almost missed with a lot of people.  Had the mainstream, corporate media had done their jobs, this documentary would not have to be made.  The myth of the liberal media is constantly perpetrated by the right wing to goad them into being more lax on the conservative views and tougher on liberal views to prove that the media is \\"fair and balanced.\\"  Had the media been liberal, there seriously would have been a tougher fight and challenge to the Bush administration in the days following the 2000 elections.  The lies of the Bush campaign would have been more fodder than Gore's exaggerations regarding Love Story, Love canal, and the Internet.  The most enlightening thing about this film is that I never knew that no Senator sided with members of the black caucus in the U.S. House to formally protest the 2000 elections in Florida (the disenfranchisement of the African American vote).  Why didn't Senator Feingold, the conscience of the Senate, come to their aid?  Is the U.S. Senate that cliquey that they can just tell members of Congress to sit down and shut up if no Senator signed their protest petition?  This was all new to me, because no where in our \\"liberal media\\" was that story ever mentioned.  Since I don't have cable, I can't see CSPAN to know what's going on in the bowels of our government.  For that reason alone, I'm grateful to Moore for bringing it to our attention. <br /> <br />My favorite scene in this film is the use of Bush's \\"Top Gun\\" type flight to the USS Abraham Lincoln to pronounce \\"Mission Accomplished\\" in Iraq, just a month and a half after the war began, and when just around 100 military members lost their lives.  It was a footage that Republicans hoped to use at their Convention but backfired because of the mess Iraq has become.  What made this footage even more brilliant was Moore's selection of the song from \\"Greatest American Hero\\" (\\"Believe it or not\\") to illustrate his point (I especially loved the line, \\"it should have been somebody else\\"--a not to subtle nod that the presidency does indeed belong to someone else). <br /> <br />Some criticisms have focused on \\"potshots\\", the private scenes of Bush goofing for the camera before announcing that the war is on, Wolfowitz licking his comb to wet down his hair, Condi getting her face powdered, and Ashcroft singing horribly a song he wrote.  Yes, they are potshots, but the administration has brought it on themselves with their not too hidden disdain of the American people.  If people would read the history books, they'll see that this sort of ridiculing of the people in power isn't new.  During the reign of Louis XVI and Marie Antoinette, the people burned in effigy members of the government, put on adult rated puppet shows showing members of the Royal family in a negative light, and worse.  The relations between the people in power and the people who are governed rests on a mutual respect, and when an administration has shown its contempt for American values again and again, ridicule is sometimes the only way to get back at them.  Besides all that, I don't recall hearing much protest against some of the things conservatives joked about regarding Clinton and his administration.  That's the beauty of living in a free society...our leaders are not above ridicule if they invite it upon themselves. <br /> <br />This film is a tad bit long and could have been cut some, especially the parts about the lone policeman patrolling Oregon's long border.  That's all interesting stuff that could have been a side feature mini-documentary on the DVD rather than be a part of the actual film.  I felt that it slowed the film down and sidetracked it just a little from the main focus of the film, which is the war in Iraq. <br /> <br />What surprised me most about this film was how funny it was.  There haven't been much to laugh about since the 2000 elections and 9/11, but Moore brilliantly manages to find the humor in these strange times, mostly at the expense of the people hired to govern us, but also in the deceptive manner in which Marine recruiters go about looking for recruits.  I loved how the Marine asked someone his name and address to cross him off their list, while writing it down instead to send a brochure later.  I'm surprised that the Marines would allow themselves to be portrayed making false promises of wealth and fame to college bound teenagers.  That's one part of the documentary I'd like to see documentation on, because its simply too good to be true that Moore caught the Marines being deceptive like that on camera. <br /> <br />This film ends on such a devastating blow to the Administration, using the words of Britney Spears and George W. Bush concerning trust and not getting fooled again.  I loved that Moore read some passages from Orwell's \\"1984\\", the most relevant novel of the times about how the government can switch enemies in the middle of a war and its citizens don't blink an eye, and how war is used more to control the populace at home than to bring about a serious victory in another country.  Yes, when it all boils down to it, why should we send our young and less economically affluent to die in overseas wars for rich men who avoided war when they had their chance to serve?  When are we going to wake up to the truth that we are the ones who will ultimately pay the cost in blood so that a few can get rich and gain evermore power.  This film is the wake up call of our generation.  Will we heed that call before too many more lives are ruined?
B000002HJD|4.0|Like others I also give this fours stars instead of five.  And I do so as a penalty to the remaining doors, Bruce Botnick (engineer), and most of all world class sycophant - Danny Sugarman.  This is Morrison's last recorded piece of significance (there also was a drunk session in Paris with a couple of street musicians.)  Sugarman has turned a fortunate position as groupie / sycophant in the doors L.A office answering fan mail into a career of self-promotion, mining a dead man's hard work, and worse ...  If you've ever met Sugarman you'll get the idea.  Morrison did not write this stuff as a doors project.  And, as the late doors producer Paul Rothchild stated, it was never meant to be an opportunity for Sugarman's group to increase their product line.  Saddest of all, the original recordings of Morrison have been torn into a million pieces and reassembled in whatever order best fit the noises the rest of the band could make years after Morrison's death.   I understand it must be hard for the Robbie, John and Ray not to reach back and have another moment with the lost friend, but this is really over the line of good taste.  And that is unusual for these three guys - particularly Robbie and John.  If you are a doors fan then you'll surely enjoy this work - just don't play it on the 405 on your way to work.  Like much of the doors work, this requires some work from the listener.  Their music isn't a soundtack for plodding from work to purchase.  Instead, go to the desert, listen, and wait for the sun but be careful about picking up hitchhikers.  Finally, could we have a break from the jealousy of wannabe artists (Rob O'Connor) who are stuck in jobs they hate like journalism, copy writing for web sites, or as music critics who can't seem to separate Morrison's work from the life he lived?  They seem to know little or nothing about Morrison other than what they've read in their competitor's publications.  And their qualifications for making meaning from the Art of others is a mystery never explained or demonstrated.  It's bad enough for them that Morrison had an I.Q. of 160 plus, was classically attractive in the extreme, had a Master's from UCLA, often knew more about Literature than his university professors, had a distinctive voice perfectly suited to his work, and worst of all, had all the girls looking for him (Jim) that the wannabe artists (like Amazon's Rob O'Connor) wished were looking for them (show us the green Rob!)  It must really crush these guys that Morrison could stumble in to a house drunk, sit on the toilet, listen to Robbie, John and Ray on a rough Jam of L.A. Woman and then, on the spot with no notes or notebooks, simply start creating and singing the lyrics onto the recording tape.  Then have another bottle and do it again from scratch with Riders on the Storm.  That Morrison's first cut at the lyrics was exactly what was published / used must make these wannabes want to reach for their own bottle.  Time generally separates the great works from the lesser stuff.   It seems generally agreed that the doors impact on bands since is very significant.  And despite the media's infatuation with promoting the Beatles and the Stones, the truth seems to be that each successive generation is voting for the doors.
B000001FO4|5.0|IS A CD I NEVER GET TIRED OF LISTENING TO !! IT STANDS THE TEST OF TIME AND TOM KEIFER HAS AN AMAZING VOICE..THIS IS , BY FAR, THEIR BEST !!
B00026YO36|4.0|I haven't really given Mark Lanegan much of a thought since the Screaming Trees \\"Dust.\\"  It seems that I should have.  Bubblegum is a fine album evoking both 60's acid rock (as the Screaming Trees often did) and more out there artists like Tom Waits.  The fact that Lanegan measures favorably with Waits instead of as a second rate copy speaks is very impressive.  This is a very diverse album with some great rock songs in Hit the City and Driving Death Valley Blues, lots of late night atmospherics, and a wonderful duet with PJ Harvey on Come To Me.<br /><br />Bubblegum is worth your attention.
0780623703|4.0|the basic story is that peter parker from spider man goes into his tv into a black and white world called pleasureville.errrr pleasentville.regardless,its a old tv sitcom from the 50s.everything he does has a drastic effect on thier world.for instance,he showed up late to work and the diner guy stood and scrubbed the same spot on the bar until he got there since it was a break in their routine.then his prissy,stuck up sister shows and acts like a ho.this introduces another foriegn element into this world.with each new element,a new color would appear in the movie.the people in town started freaking out about  this.its really neat.the guy who played spider man is the main  character.his sister is just another horny teenager.chicks like her are like a stop sign.theres a new one at every corner.its a one of a kind movie like wizard of oz meets back to the future.his sister is kinda cute though.the message is all about the social transformations between the 50s and 60s.the special effects are pretty cool.i doubt there will be a sequel since theres no way it could ever approach the genius of the first one.
B0002KQNJU|5.0|The Greatest spoof on Vampire movies ever! Two goofball vampire hunters roam Transylvania in search of Vapires. They finally come upon the gothic castle of Count Von Krolock to rescue the beautiful girl, Sarah. <br />             The cast is great, Jack Macgowran as the goofy Professor Abronsius, Roman Polanski as his loyal assistant Alfred, and Ferdy Mayne as Count Von Krolock. The scenery is beautiful with the snow, Macgowran and Polanski are so great together as Professor and student that they are just like Laurel And Hardy. <br />             The only extra here is a promo film starring the Great British Actor Max Wall as a Dimwitted Professor telling the audience how to destroy vampires. It runs about 10 minutes and the professor is pestered by a bat and a Dracula like vampire in a coffin.  <br />             This is a film for the ages, everyone should see this who wants to laugh!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B0002OERI0|5.0|This is the best CD I've purchased in a VERY long time. I was impressed by the variety of sound and of course, the disguised prez bashing (KERRY EDWARDS 04)...however subtle. I love all the tracks on the CD..each has a unique sound and message! I'd HIGHLY recommend this CD to anyone!
B00005JMAH|5.0|Before I saw Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, I hadn't read any of the books, I had seen the first two movies and thought they were okay.  With the Prisoner of Azkaban, the director created such a \\"real\\" world, that the first two movies didn't.  The third movie was more like Lord of the Rings and Star Wars in the way it created its own reality.  <br /> <br />I have now read all the books twice and am a huge Harry Potter fan because this movie drew me in.
B00009V7T2|5.0|cedric and omar have clearly defined themselves as the musical geniuses behind ATDI.  There has never been anything similar to this music.  Mars Volta throws away all the elements that you once knew about commercial music and present a marvelous masterpiece of a concept album.  If you have ever heard a track from Mars Volta and are enticed, research the story behind the album and you will respect the creativity of these artists far more.  This band is at least 10 years ahead of their time.  You will either become obsessed with the album or just flat out not understand and that is okay, this music is not for most.
B00005JMJG|5.0|i had no intention of buying this dvd when i went for aladdin, and fahrenheit 9/11. after reading all these great reviews from dvd folks like myself, i was drawn to it, got it watched it asap after i got home. and was whoa just whats going on here?! i was confused but somewhat moved. today i popped it in my system, and aahh now i see where the whole thing was coming from right from the start!  mr. kaufman you are genius, sir!  no less brilliant, however, are jim carrey and kate winslet in the lead roles and truly the best of their careers to date! the superlative supporting cast, ms. dunst, mr. ruffalo, mr. wood, and tom wilkinson all played their parts so realistically, today i was glued to the screen. it is a masterpiece so beautifully constructed  it's rather hard to explain. in short, i love this film-it owns me now, so thanks dear fellow dvd people here-i am grateful.
B00005JMJG|5.0|This movie was certainly a thrillride of a surprise. Jim Carrey and Kate Winslet both took on roles completely different from what they usually do, and it turned out to be something fantastic. It's funny, it's truthful, it's heartfelt, and did I forget the thrillride part? The best thing about this movie is that you can watch it like a million times and not get bored with it. I'm a huge fan of movies that make you think about things, and this is definitly one of those.
B00005JNEI|5.0|This film simply raises a standard on film as communication elevated beyond mere entertainment. Whether or not you take to Moore's style or ethos - this film is comprised of segments of real people and real events. The facts do check out better than what passes for most corporate owned News. Any english speaking citizen of the world that hasn't seen the footage should see it, and for better or for worse this is where you will see footage that that American media outlets have let slide by. The networks and print syndicates are not doing it - someone should be. Even if there's a doofy disagreeable narrator with a chip on his shoulder leading the charge, WATCH THIS FILM. Even if you're a freakshow Foxwatcher or professional wrestling fan, watch this film - YOU WILL have a different opinion after it than you did before you saw it.
0671027387|4.0|In the year of the presidential election campaign NASA makes a shattering discovery: a meteorite is found in the Arctic ice that contains information that can tip the scales of the race for the presidency towards the current president. Zach Herney has been under heavy siege by his opponent, Senator Sedgewick Sexton, for the recent failures and over expenditures of NASA. The president hires a team of civilian scientists to confirm the find and also asks the daughter of Sexton, Rachel Sexton who is an analyst for a state security agency, to confirm the authenticity of the meteorite. When they ultimately find a flaw, things start to unravel fast: someone definitely wants does not want their finding to become public knowledge and is prepared to kill them to prevent this from happening. What follows is a race across the globe between three ingenious people and a heavily armed team of killers. In the meantime a number of political games are being played in Washington that leave the reader guessing at who is the bad guy behind all this.<br /><br />Even though the story is less credible than the Da Vinci Code by the same author, it is still an enjoyable read. The story takes a while to get properly started but once all the characters are in place, events follow each other up at breakneck speed. Nice book to read during a holiday on the beach or a long winter weekend next to the fire.
B0000025D0|5.0|This album was released in 1978, 3 yrs after his breakthrough Born to Run, a more approachable collection of songs by Bruce Springsteen. DET is a darker album, containing some of his most passionate vocals, and gut-wrenching songs. The one irony I always found with Bruce Springsteen was the fact that his voice was so expressive, yet he sold out stadiums and sold millions of albums. He still has his anthemic punch on mostof the songs on this album, like \\"Badlands,\\" \\"Adam Raised a Cain,\\" \\"Candy's Room,\\" and \\"Prove it All Night,\\" yet it sounds more menacing than the exhilerating feeling of \\"Born to Run\\" or \\"Thunder Road,\\" however \\"Candy's Room,\\" a sotry opf a love encounter with a prostitute, is very exciting and it builds up momentum. Yet there are a few bleak moments on this album, particularly one of his most underrated songs \\"Streets of Fire.\\" His vocals at the end are almost unmatched by anyone, in terms of emotion, resonance and inner pain (surprising, since Springsteen is such a mainstream figure). Overall, this album is emotionally intense and one of his best.
B0000047CX|5.0|To this date, this remains the GOLD STANDARD for all bossa nova records.  It was the highpoint.  For once, it had Stan Getz, Joao Gilberto and Antonio Carlos Jobim - all the major forces of bossa nova on one record - I don't believe that ever happened again. <br /> <br />The playing is superb and you can hear and feel the chemistry and enjoyment of the group.  The songs are timeless and sound fresh 40 yrs later......noone could play the sax like Stan Getz. <br /> <br /> <br />The sound is amazing.  Verve did a heck of a job remastering an already great 30 inch per second (15 inch was common).. <br /> <br />I can only repeat, if u ever get only ONE bossa nova album, this is it.
1401301010|1.0|This is a story of Anthony K's life, which I'm sure was dictated by him, but the other guy listed above actually WROTE the book. So when you talk about how it flowed, the eloquence, blah blah blah..... you are talking about that other guy. Anthony Kiedis did not WRITE the book. <br /> <br />Kiedis was on the Howard Stern show this morning and didn't even recognize certain passages as they were read aloud from the book. So I don't think he had too much to do with it!
0345410025|4.0|I have been using these techniques for about a month and I have noticed a significant improvement in my ability to remember things that I normally would have not, particularly telephone numbers. It is certainly a quick read, though I could have sumed up the basic points of the book on one or two pages. I highly recommend this book as a starter to anyone interested in improving their memory.
B000089CJI|3.0|Such Great Heights is what hooked me into Postal Service since i am a big fan of the music that seems reflected here at times.. New Order, Erasure, Electronic, Pet Shop Boys.. its a beautiful electro pop single. <br /> <br />The problem is, its not a bad album, except for me, Mr Gibbards vocals get on my nerves after a song or two.. they are just too, hmm, sensitive suburban white boy from madison wisconsin or something. <br /> <br />Is it daring for an indie band to pick up electronic music, yes it is.. i give them props. Is it particularly daring music in itself.. not really in the electronic music world. certainly not as revolutionary as Joy Divisions change to New Order, or as interesting as Everything But The Girls transformation from lounge pop to house and drum n bass. It goes down a slightly Bjorkish road of DSP/Glitch Pop, but nothing horribly daring as say a Matmos, Plaid or Pole.
B0000057C5|5.0|... but would everyone SHUT UP ALREADY about the whole \\"Du hast\\" hate/have thing? Thank you!  <br /> <br />I don't have much to add to what has already been said, just that \\"Bestrafe Mich\\" is probably my favourite song on the album, as I just can't get enough of the riffs on it. And the lyrics are great. Till, I'd punish you any day of the week! <br /> <br />And to those people complaining that Rammstein sing mainly in German: you can all shut up, too. Billions of people around the world listen to music in English without understanding a word of it but do you hear them whining?  <br /> <br />As for the reviewer (who claimed to speak German) who translated \\"Antlitz\\" as \\"sundial\\" ... well. Words fail me. <br /> <br />I prefer \\"Herzeleid\\" and \\"Mutter\\" (and \\"Reise Reise\\" is pretty good too\\") but this is still an amazing album. I hope they tour again soon - last two times they visited these shores coincided exactly with my end-of-year university exams. It's a conspiracy, I tell you! They're the one band left who I *must* see before I die/they split up ...
B000002H33|4.0|Master of Puppets was a great album but some of the tracks like Disposable Heroes and Leper Messiah were boring. At least it is better than St Anger!
6302814359|4.0|Return of the Living Dead 2: This was a childhood favorite of mine (I lived off of horror movies).  As far as the realism scale, it's not quite as believable as the black and white of things in Night of the Living Dead.  It's more campy and comic book-ish, but that's not a bad thing necessarily.<br /><br />The &#34;tar zombie&#34; as fans affectionately call him is one of the most memorable and creepy zombies ever to grace (ooze?) across the screen.<br /><br />(Edit: this opinion is based on the 2004 DVD release-- there has since been newer releases that may not be reflected on this review in regards to audio and visual quality.) The picture quality is very well done, I swear I see all the grossness of the tar zombie in all it's glory as I've never seen before.  Yes, the soundtrack is changed, and yes, I did notice it even though it's been about 3 years since I last saw the movie.<br /><br />I have to admit, the new soundtrack utterly blows.  There's some pounding intense synthesizer music during the tar zombie scene, and the movie quickly edits to Jessie running away in the graveyard.  The music doesn't have any flow from one pace to the other in this time; it goes from this suspenseful music to slow and eerie like the music was cut in midbeat.  It's like getting about 3/4 the way through the Jaws theme and in the middle of the note it goes to the Halloween music theme.  There were at least 3 instances that I saw where either the dialogue was not in sync with the actors mouths or the actors mouths were moving and nothing was heard at all.  Good movie, BAD new audio track.  Seriously, we need the old one back.<br /><br />Ultimately, it doesn't ruin the movie but it's a big dent on the side of car.
B0002Y69NG|3.0|I dont know....seems cool....but the sad thing is i have almost all the stuff in here! Do the dvd shells have a new look finally? or is everything the same except the other 'extra' dvd's? I am a pretty big matrix fan, or i was..... im still waiting to find out if i will be able to play the matrix online game....which you have to pay MONTHLY for.....but im still a pretty big matrxi fan but i dont know if this set will include anything that will be majorly different, besides the audio commentaries. i know, no director comments, what did you expect? like Tolkien, the WB's hate allegory, so they dont want to tell you the meanings, although Tokien has a FAAAAAR better story, and now,the all time best movies ever. but the ending of the third got me ticked off and kinda confused about everything...i mean ...should i be happy or sad or what??? In lotr's, the ending is the ending, but here, it seems like theres gonna be MORE movies, but of course, thats absurd...they gotta make a game!!!? well, i used to be a big fan, now its just silly. but ill find out more about this set when i read reviews about it when it comes out. and thats what im sticking to for now. all in all, the movies are pretty good, and defiently not bad. i know alot of the meanings behind things, namely from spending hours on the matrix online boards, discussing them. and ill tell ya, you find out alot of stuff about the movies and their meanings on there, lol. anyway, im not gonna get this set unless other reviewers and/or other matrix fans like me say that its good and thats its better the the theatrical released dvd's.
B0002S94OS|5.0|I was really impressed with As the Palaces Burn when it first came out, but this album is superior in just about every way. The production is a lot thicker and their songwriting has really progressed. Every song on this album is memorable and distinct - not like the previous two albums where the songs kind of tended to run together. The singer is really at his best on this one - he uses the low voice primarily, accenting certain parts with that piercing scream. The cadence and phrasing are just about perfect, the lyrics full of spite and subtle sarcasm. The guitars have gotten more diverse in their use of complex bridges and non-power chords, and they've almost shaken that Slayer-riff syndrome that tended to water down their originality on As the Palaces Burn. As usual there are plenty of tight double bass/picking patterns, but the thing I really like about the drums on this album is the way they bring them to the forefront on certain parts, like the tradeoff at the end of \\"One Gun.\\" The 808 here and there is a nice touch as well. If you like complex death/thrash/hardcore full of hammering grooves and intricate patterns, don't hesitate to get this album. It's easily one of the best releases of the year.
B0002OERI0|5.0|Being a very loyal fan of theirs since 1,039 and loving every piece of work that spans 9 records (Compilations, etc) I was blown away by this album. Ever since hearing the band was gonna record 30 songs for this album, I was psyched. Hearing American Idiot's lead single made me jump for joy expecting a full out assaul from Green Day.<br />What I got was beyond anything I was expecting. Every aspect of the album is phenominal: recording, packaging, lyrics, music... It honestly has it all. It made people I know who lost interest in the band renew their faith as well as newcomers alike. The possibility of making this a movie/play delights me even more.<br />Billie Joe's lyrics are golden as always. Tre and Mike have never been more inspring at what they do as well. You'll be mesmerized from start to finish with this piece. I garantee it.<br />Stand out tracks:<br />Holiday &amp; Boulevard of Broken Dreams: The seguay works so well and the songs are so magnificent, I doubt anybody doesn't adore these two tracks.<br />Jesus of Suburbia: The stronger rock opera of the two (Homecoming). I personally think ever band must have a song written like this. It truly shows you what they can do as artists.<br />Letterbomb: I didn't see how great this song was at first, but in the end grew to love it. Lyrically, it's fantastic but the bridge/chorus/outro are what keep me coming back to this over and over.<br />Whatsherface: The closing to this album really makes you want to hit the repeat button and start all over.<br />Don't take anything away from the other songs since they all have the power to stand alone as great pieces of work.<br />Green Day are just going to get bigger and better until they retire, which I doubt is anytime soon.
B0002VKZL6|4.0|I'm no Mark Knopfler fan, no Dire Straits fan.  I heard Knopfler on NPR, liked what I heard, and decided to try this album.  Is it a break through work? No, it's fairly conventional; however, it's very nice provided it's what you want.  At first, it can be difficult to differentiate the tracks.  Save for \\"Postcards from Paraguay\\" and \\"Boom, like that\\", the tracks are mellow to say the least.  By the third go around, the songs do establish their own musical and lyrical identity. Not being well acquainted with much of Knopfler's work, I was pleasantly surprised with the quality of the lyrics.  If you like the humor and delivery of Stan Ridgeway, this album will sound familiar (Knopfler should tour with Ridgeway and treat us to a duet on \\"Mexican Radio\\"). As a guitarist, I'm well acquainted with Knopfler's skill with the guitar.  This album does not showcase that in the conventional way.  Those who expect lengthy solos and fast, fluid riffs will be disappointed.  On this album, Knopfler's playing is understated, but full of very tasty and satisfying musical phrases, (try \\"Sucker Row\\").  He writes songs, not vehicles for showing off his virtuosity, which should no longer be in question.  For those who can find more pleasure in the right five notes than in the wrong 20,this album will be a treat.  <br />This is not an album for all occasions. Do not play it when driving tired through Nevada at 2:00 a.m.  However, it's the right album for any fan of thoughtful music and substance.
B0002OERI0|5.0|This album has given me faith in music again.   <br /> <br />I seriously can't stop listening to this release, searching for the lyrics, obsessing about the meanings of the songs/movements, and thinking about what it must have been like to hear Tommy or Quadrophenia for the first time. <br /> <br />I guess the closest thing i have to reference is my discovery of &#34;the Wall&#34; in 1979 when i was 11.  I feel like a kid again.... <br /> <br />A most ambitious release - i wish most bands would put this much effort into thier CDs. <br /> <br />Billy, Tre and Mike ----&#62; Thanks.
B00005JNEI|5.0|Republican or democrat, liberal or conservative, rich or poor, left or right, who cares, just watch this.  It would be nice if people just threw away their biases and affiliations and just for once, opened up their minds.  In an age of unprecendent media viewership and domination of the world, it's hard to tell what to accept and what not to accept.  However, one always knows whether something is right or wrong.  A live clip of an explosive attack against a post of American troops, mutilated corpses, dead babies...those are nothing that special effects could ever touch. These things could never be staged.   <br /> <br />I don't care what your beliefs are, but if you just walked away from this movie, shrugging it off with whatever premanufactured dismissals of a work of this nature and magnitude, you are beyond ignorant.  A forceful generalization, yes indeed.  If you refuse to watch this film for any other reason than it's extremely graphic and rather disturbing nature, you need to open up your eyes to the real world.   <br /> <br />Michael Moore is obviously biased, but who isn't?  I will not say that I completely agree with his beliefs, having read all of his works and watched Bowling for Columbine.  However, in Fahrentheit 9/11, Moore barely interjects his opinions like has in his previous works.  He does something that very fiew journalists, news channels, politicians, and Americans have remotely done--let the evidence do the talking.   <br /> <br />I give this movie 5 stars as a concerned individual growing up in this world.  I am not even old enough to vote, and I have no political affilations.  I am giving it 5 stars because it realistically depicts the realities of this world.  Let me place an emphasis on reality.  Fahrentheit 9/11, though clearly biased and with certain discrepancies, shows you what numbers, campaign ads, newspapers, news stations, and politicians cannot--reality.
B0002Z9HT8|4.0|IT'S ABOUT TIME THAT THIS IS FINALLY BEING RELEASED ON DVD--<br /><br />I HAVE NOT SEEN THIS LIVE SHOW SINCE THE DAY IT ACTUALLY AIRED. I HOWEVER AM VERY DISAPPOINTED TO HEAR THAT SEVERAL PERFORMANCES HAVE BEEN CUT... ALTHOUGH THEY CUT NO U2-- ALLELUIA! I CANNOT WAIT TO SEE BONO IN ALL HIS GLORY AGAIN, TO SEE ONE OF FREDDIE MERCURY'S LAST GREAT PERFORMANCES AGAIN, AND MUCH MORE. THANK YOU BOB GELDOF FOR FINALLY RELEASING THIS GREAT SHOW. (: I AM ONE VERY HAPPY ADULT WHO GREW UP IN THE 80'S. THANK YOU, THANK YOU, THANK YOU...
B000002UA5|4.0|I have always said and known that Pink Floyd was actually Pink Floyd after Barret left and Waters was still playing. Well, Ummagumma is the starting point. This album is very experimental, it appears that the band is just getting ready before making something big, like every member is testing his skills. There are songs made by each member, and each one of them is concentrating on what they can do, and you feel the essence of, for example, Gilmour when listening to The Narrow Way, you can hear that they have focused on those songs like showing themselves, putting themselves in those tracks. The album is for Pink Floyd fans, 'cause if you like this one, you must be a fan. The songs may sound crazy and may seem that they make no sense, but if the band made them, they thought about it seriously. That's the Young Pink Floyd you can hear, you will find no bond between Ummagumma and, for example Animals or The Wall. The Live album includes a perfect version of Careful With That Axe, Eugene, that's the best one of all I've heard. So I do not reccomend Ummagumma to Pink Floyd newbies for they can just not understand it and abandon Pink Floyd forever, never listening to their other masterpieces.
B00005JNEI|1.0|This movie destroyed every shred of liberalism in my body, and I am honest when I say that I was pretty much a left-winger when I went in.  To call this movie a \\"documentary\\" is to defecate on every worthy documentary ever made.  Half of the movie is a collection of clips in which George W. Bush speaks like a total idiot, and I agree that he is not a very good public speaker...at all.  But, that doesn't make a movie.  Anyone can watch him do that by watching television. <br /> <br />It is not entertaining to watch an overweight man with a greasy baseball cap get into an ice cream truck and read the Patriot Act into a loudspeaker while passing by several people, most of which are probably wondering what the heck he's doing.  The same goes for his little \\"stunt\\" with the Marine where the honorable Mr. Moore walks up to several Congressmen and asks them to send their sons to Iraq \\"to help out over there.\\"  Apparently, this man has not heard of the concept of \\"choice.\\"   <br /> <br />What really infuriates me is what happens in the last 45 minutes of the film.  Mr. Moore shamelessly exploits the unbearable grief Lila Lipscomb (a grieving mother who lost a son in Iraq) has to deal with.  He videotapes her while she relates the horrible moment when the phone call came in, and even follows her to 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, where she vents her cries and screams at the White House.  Everyone who has a heart has been sympathizing with everyone who has ever lost a child.  After viewing this part of the movie, I lost every ounce of respect I had for Mr. Moore. <br /> <br />I read right through the Anti-American Michael Moore, and it is very clear that he is trying to get the whole country angry with the current President; he is also trying to get right-wingers to agree with him through the use of shock-value and by distorting the facts.  Congratulations, Mr. Moore!  You've not only failed with me, but you've accomplished the opposite of what you set out to do! <br /> <br />The paragraph above was the end of my review, and here comes the recommendation part.  I'm not going to say that I wouldn't recommend it, because this is the kind of movie that viewers will either love or hate.  If you are very liberal (not slightly, because that's where I was) and can't stand Dubya, I highly recommend Fahrenheit 9/11 (I know this is throwing off the whole attitude my review started with, but I'm being fair).  If you are conservative in any way, though, stay as far away from it as possible.
B00005JNEI|5.0|While the right wing will simply write off this film as left wing propaganda, one cannot deny the images of the horror of the Iraqi war. In the patriotic zeal of the war coverage, Americans were only shown images of victory and good overcomes evil. Michael Moore shows the personal devastation on both sides. From Lila Lipscomb, a proud military mom, who lost her son in the war to the streets of Iraq where shell shocked parents carry their mortally wounded children in search of medical care. In light of the current information that Iraq was not responsible for 9/11, had no WMDs and was at least a decade away from reconstituting a formidable weapons program makes this even more tragic. The fact that our current administration still contends it would have done \\"exactly the same thing\\" underscores the need to vote these guys out of the White House on November 2. The fact is if we don't learn from our mistakes, we are doomed to repeat them. An even sadder truth is the people who make these mistakes aren't the ones that pay for them. We do.
0465011020|5.0|This story gives us an inside view of the horrors of prison life, and life on the \\"outside,\\" in the DPRK (North Korea).  In spite of a slightly unpolished translation, the writing is clearly understandable, and I found the story entrancing.  It is not at all like wading through scholarly journals to get the same information, as one less-than-enthusiastic reviewer has written.  I have studied North Korea for over ten years, and would recommend this book as a good introduction to the brutality of the regime. <br /> <br />There are two oddities. The title refers to the author's boyhood fish collection, and I am not sure why that title was chosen.  The cover has a picture of a large assemblage of weeping and tearful children, all in unform.  It looks like a mass mourning organized upon the death of Kim Il-Sung, but nowhere is there a credit or a reference to this picture, so a reader without previous knowledge might be puzzled by it.
0679731725|5.0|May I venture to say, and I hope I am not being presumptuous here, that Mr Kazuo Ishiguro has achieved a remarkable feat here in his portrayal of an upper class English servant between the two wars.  In spite of his birth language and comparative youth, he was born after WWII, Mr Ishiguro has captured the quiet dignity and tone of a butler whose life task is to provide exemplary service to his betters, anticipating their every whim and supporting their efforts to uphold the honour required of a gentleman. <br /> <br />Whilst his grasp of the English language is undoubtedly attributable to the young age at which Mr Ishiguro moved to Great Britain, his research skills and deep understanding of the human psyche shine as he describes the personal and physical journey of his protagonist, Mr Stevens junior, butler to the late, and in some circles, less than lamented Lord Darlington. <br /> <br />Mr Stevens is a man of the highest ideals, counting as paramount his devotion to his duty to further his employer's aims and his maintenance of his own professional `dignity'.  Sadly, it might be said, that this comes at some considerable cost as Mr Stevens represses all personal feelings, including his love for the passionate Miss Kenton and deep affection and respect for his own father, in favour of fulfilling his professional duties.  In fact, it could be said, if one could be excused for using the parlance of the inhabitants of the Antipodes, that Mr Stevens would not recognize an emotion if it bit him on the, eh, nether regions. <br /> <br />The bleakness of the ending is palliated by Mr Steven's decision to enjoy the remains of his day.  He has hit upon a key for achieving this and resolves to \\"look at this whole matter of bantering more enthusiastically ... particularly if it is the case that in bantering lies the key to human warmth.\\"  With his customary application Mr Sevens resolves to acquire the ability as it is \\"hardly an unreasonable duty for an employer to expect aprofessional to perform.\\" (p245, First Vintage International Edition, September 1990) <br /> <br />The beauty of this novel lies in the language; one finds one's self starting to adopt a faint echo of it in one's speech and writing, to the surprise of close family and acquaintances.  Mr Ishiguro's mastery is shown in the effortless  shifts from present to past; in the tone of  Mr Steven's language; and by allowing the reader to understand Mr Stevens long before he is able to even approach understanding either himself or the significance of the events happening around him. <br /> <br />This novel is highly recommended to the discerning reader. <br />  <br />
B00028HBKM|5.0|If you are a delicate, nervous person who hates blood and raw flesh, well man this is not a movie for you. But if you have some beliefs or have ever read about the last hours of Jesus, this could be a good approach to what really happened. And sure, a braveheart could only make this movie with hands in his own pockets, not to fulfill Hollywood patterns. Great movie!

B00005QZ7U|3.0|Friends of mine had been telling me for two years to watch this movie, more because I love Baz Luhrmann's cinematographic genius than anything else. Sappy love movies are not my thing. I have to admit that I didn't hate it as much as I thought I was going to, but I could have lived without Ewan McGregor being such a whiny sap and while we're being honest, Nicole Kidman should, like most of the rest of us, limit her singing to the car and the shower. She doesn't have a bad voice, just not one I would go out of my way to hear. There were three good things about this movie. 1. John Leguizamo, who has yet to suck in anything I've seen him in, including Summer of Sam, 2. Jim Broadbent, who is absolutely BRILLIANT and 3. Jacek Koman's rendition of The Police hit 'Roxanne' in a mass tango. Tangos done right are spectacular and this one is by far the best I've seen on film. Overall, it's a fine movie if that's what you're into. It wasn't a waste of my time, just not really my kind of movie.
B000063DI9|5.0|Seventh Son Of A Seventh Son, a concept-album is one of my favourite Maiden albums of all-time. Compared to earlier Maiden albums, this album sounds more progressive. The album mainly sounds progressive because the band uses guitar and bass synths. I still think that Seventh Son Of A Seventh Son is one of the best-produced Maiden albums. Especially the guitars have a fuller sound compared to later albums. The fuller guitars and the use of synths and keyboards make the album more bombastic than other Maiden albums.<br /><br />The album starts out with \\"Moonchild\\". The song begins with an acoustic intro, with some soft vocal lines. After that the song really begins. \\"Moonchild\\" is a rather fast song and you immediately notice the use a synths. \\"Infinite Dreams\\" is one of the more interesting songs. It starts out slow, but halfway the tempo will be shifted up a few gears. The vibe of the song totally changes from moody to aggressive. \\"Infinite Dreams\\" is definitely one of the best songs on the album. \\"Can I Play With Madness\\" is a good, short and catchy song, but it still is the least interesting song on the album. \\"The Evil That Men Do\\" is also a catchy song, but much better than \\"Can I Play With Madness\\". The song starts with a superb melodic lead and the whole song remains melodic. Iron Maiden still plays the song live.<br /><br />One of the most underrated songs from Iron Maiden has got to be the title track. The song almost lasts ten minutes, starts very slow and bombastic. The middle part mostly consists of atmospheric keys and the song ends with a spectacular guitar duel. Especially the guitar harmony at the end of the song is brilliant. \\"The Prophecy\\" starts with an impressive guitar-sound. It is one of the biggest guitars-sounds Maiden has ever recorded. On this song vocalist Bruce Dickinson uses some interesting raw vocals besides his normal vocals. It sounds like he is singing a duet with himself. The song ends with a cool acoustic guitar outro. \\"The Clairvoyant\\" has got an excellent bass-intro. During the intro the guitars come in with a harmony and then the song is on its way. Great song. \\"Only The Good Die Young\\" is one of the least known Maiden songs, but it is still a great song to end the album. The song has some cool atmospheric key layers. The song ends just as the album started, with acoustic guitars and soft vocals.<br /><br />Seventh Son of A Seventh Son still is one of the best Metal albums ever.an excellent bass-intro. During the intro the guitars come in with a harmony and then the song is on its way. Great song. \\"Only The Good Die Young\\" is one of the least known Maiden songs, but it is still a great song to end the album. The song has some cool atmospheric key layers. The song ends just as the album started, with acoustic guitars and soft vocals.       Seventh Son of A Seventh Son still is one of the best Metal albums ever.
B00000JHAU|5.0|Belle and Sebastian aren't very ambitious.  They aren't that creative.  They don't have really all that much to say.  They are just cool.  If you listen to them you can be pretty cool too.  Not too cool but just enough.      No, but seriously, all the songs are enjoyable and a couple are really sweet and touching, The Fox in the Snow.  Probably not a 5 star album but the best one from these guys and probably deserves to be heard.
B0000630BT|5.0|Painkiller is one of the best albums Judas Priest has ever released. When I look back at the entire Priest catalogue, Painkiller is their best album since Stained Class from 1978. Although Judas Priest released some excellent albums in the 80's, I misted the more complex and epic songs of the 70's. Painkiller offers some more lengthy and complex material. When the title track starts the album, you immediately hear that the album sounds heavier and faster than previous albums. Scott Travis replaced Dave Holland on the drums for the first time and you immediately notice that Travis style is more aggressive. Also the rest of the music is more intense. Fortunately Halford still uses clean vocals besides the high screams. I personally prefer his clean vocals over his high screams. The guitar solo's on the album are really cool. (Just listen to the solo on the title track and the intro solo on \\"Metal Meltdown\\".) The solo's are lengthy and very recognizable after listening to the album a couple of times. The album is very diverse, from fast to slow songs and everything in between. Therefore every song is very recognizable. The vocals are also very divers. Just listen to the creepy vocals halfway through the song \\"Night Crawler\\". On the album Priest uses some keyboard sounds. They give the songs more texture. To conclude: Painkiller is a perfect blend between the aggression of Thrash Metal and the melody of Heavy Metal. Although the album was released in 1990, it still sounds fresh and exciting.
B0000025DT|5.0|Ok, if you're like me, you had this growing up and either have the 8-track (omg) or perhaps the cassette tape.  Now it's time to step up and get the CD.  This particular album is probably the single best to own if you are not a devout ELO follower.  They have gone through 3 or 4 really big sound changes throughout the years and if you want to get an accurate depiction of the various modes this album has most of them.  Their earlier albums had a very chamber-esque sound to them whereas their peak late 70's albums had a very electric, rythmic sound to them.  As time went on they became a bit more mainstream and vocal but managed to still give it that ELO flair we all admire.  I agree with a reviewer that said \\"Tightrope\\" has to be the best track on the album.  One thing I have noticed throughout my ELO enjoyment is that their songs and albums are tied to more great memories of my life than any other artist I can think of.  That is what makes this album paramount in any audiophile's collection.  It has such range from track to track that it's sure to please any fan regardless of which period they admire most.  This is a solid buy and should come with a money-back guarantee because you would never have to cash in on it!! <br />
B00003CXCT|5.0|The picture and sound are great for SW and ESB, but the dialogue in ROTJ is too quiet.  I was not bothered by changes in SW and ESB.  The only changes that bothered me were in ROTJ: 1. the stupid band at Jabba's palace 2. no ewok celebration song 3. replacing the original Anakin with another actor.<br /><br />Hopefully an original version will come out someday.  I did not hate these versions and don't understand why poeple are giving them one star.  If you judge it for what it is and don't compare it to the originals, its still great.
B00005JMAH|4.0|I am so happy that they made this movie. although Alfsano Curano made the movie totaly unlike the book. still, you have to admit it was still a pretty good movie. And the trailer is pretty cool!See ya later duude!
6305428387|5.0|I have always loved this movie.  It is one to make you laugh.  The characters are all very funny, especially Doug E. Doug's character, Sanka Coffey.  It is inspirational as well.  They had something they wanted to do, and they gave it their all, even when people were laughing at them and telling them they were stupid for trying.  It also always gives me a sense of pride when they all finish the race in the end.  Also, it is fun simply because it is full of Jamaican accents.  No matter how many times I see it, I will still feel the same.  I know this because I have already seen this many, many times.
B00003CXAA|5.0|Best three movies in one series of all time. Enough has been said.
B00008DDRX|5.0|This movie is absolutely fantastic. There's no better racing movie than this, because the story is simple, unlike other racing movies e.g Driven. The formula for success for a racing movie should be :- Less plot, more racing. Le Mans has certainly achieved it.
B000023VR6|5.0|I have recently purchased this item from a store. This is one of the best rap collections I have ever heard. I think that this collection is so good because the producers took the time to make it right. If you listen to music, rap, rock, or even country, please get this amazing album.
B00005QZ7U|5.0|Oh wow! I just saw this movie and am in a state of shock. What a fun movie! I never wanted it to end. I will also study the symbolism on my own. <br />
0312330529|4.0|Shantaram is certainly an impressive work; if even 10% of the novel is drawn directly from the author's experiences, Roberts must be counted as an exceptionally gifted everyman. Drug smuggler, counterfeiter, gang member, guerilla, neurosurgeon, and rock star (OK, I made the last two up), Roberts weaves an incredibly compelling tale of life and love set against the tapestry of life amid the slums of Bombay. <br /> <br />I think my one reservation about the book, apart from some repetitiveness in his descriptions, was Roberts' claim that he reached an epiphany. Within the last pages, he stabs several rival gang members and leaves the others to be carved up by a fellow gang member, is up to his neck (still) in the Bombay mafia living well off of the proceeds of his crimes, and is about to travel to Sri Lanka on (yet another) guerilla-style action as part of someone else's crusade. After almost 1000 pages of meditation on the issues of truth, integrity, compassion, and love, this is revelation? Sounds more like business as usual than a man seeking change. <br /> <br />Nevertheless, this is an epic book, with not a wizard, dwarf, or hobbit in sight. I've heard this is the first book of a trilogy; if so, I await the other volumes eagerly.
B0000251WC|5.0|As live albums go there are few better than this, by any band. Live after Death is undoubtedly the best live maiden album. The whole album is dramatic and intense. The album opens with Churchills famous war speech and launches into a brilliant rendition of Aces High. Ripping live solos and bass lines make many of these maiden songs far superior to the studio versions -songs such as Hallowed be thy name - a live classic and even the flight of icarus - a song i wasnt hugely keen on wen i heard it on piece of mind, sound passionate and intense on this album.<br />One gripe with this album is Bruce Dickinsons versions of Di'annos songs - and also a slightly disapointing version of the trooper. other than that a true masterpiece
B00003CXCT|3.0|At the end of the day it's still Starwars, and if your a big fan you'll still enjoy watching the movies. Even with all the changes    <br /> <br />Hansolo still shoots second, but this time a bit sooner. Dont understand this! Why bother changing it again? either change it back to him shooting first or leave it alone.   <br /> <br />The new improved Jabba in EpIV looks much better than the first attempt in the 1997 special editions. <br /> <br />Some lightsabers have been cleaned up to look slimmer as they appear in Ep I & II, but lukes lightsaber in Ep IV when aboard the Millennium falcon still has a thick chunky white blade where it should be thin and blue. <br /> <br />The new improved Hologram of the Emperor in Empire Strikes Back looks pretty cool.   <br /> <br />As for the ending.....Well fair enough if Lucas wanted to change Anakins appearance to Hayden Krsitian....BUT, If he changed Anakin to a younger Kristian Hayden, shouldn't he have changed  Obi Wan to a younger Ewan Mcgregor...instead of Alec Guiness still being there.  It doesn't make sense... One Jedi comes back looking old and battered but the other comes back looking young & fresh. <br /> <br />Why change stuff that does'nt need changing, but then leave crap effects like the explosions of the first death star in Ep IV, which looks like Christmas decorations being smashed with a cricket bat....ok maybe not that crap.  But if they're making changes they could have changed that part of the movie, along with the Alderan explosion in Ep IV   <br /> <br />Boba fett doesnt sound as nasty anymore with Temuera Morrisons voice dubbed over, Don't get me wrong Temuera Morrison is tough looking especially in \\"Once were warriors as Jake Heke\\" and as Jango Fett in Ep II, but he doesn't sound that tough in Ep V as the voice of Bobba Fett.  The original Boba fett voice sounded more menacing <br /> <br />Anyway the changes have been made, and there is nothing we can do about that.  As for the Extras....Not bad, but there isn't much.  Most fans would like to watch the makings off, the out takes, the deleted scenes etc.  The box set has none off that.  However what is included, is pretty good.  The History of starwars is very interesting, along with the preview of episode III.  DVD menus etc have been done very well, with some cool backgrounds and short movie clips in between.     <br /> <br />Hopefully we can look forward to more extras when Ep 3 is released and they have a new box set for the first 3 episodes....or a few years after that when they release a 6 DVD box set...or a few more years after that when they release a special edition version of episode I, II & III....or a few years after that when they release the Originals as a 6 set DVD....or a few years after that when they release a 12 set DVD with the originals and the special editions.....or a few years after that when George Lucas finally snuffs it, and they release another box set in his memory, with a picture of him on the back glowing like a Jedi who has joined to the force.....Question is will the Box display a recent picture of him as he looks now.....or one where he looks a bit younger and actually knows what hes doing. <br /> <br />Overall, not bad, but it could have been Great!!  Like most fans I have been a bit disappointed, with the changes, but as I said earlier its still Starwars, and its still cool!!    <br />
B0002XVQNU|5.0|Seems like there's another superhero movie coming out every weekend.  What I like about Daredevil was that it was different, it wasn't afraid to show a superhero in a new light and that, for me, was worth the price of admission.  I thought the look of the movie was exceptional, dark, and full of atmosphere.  I think there were some story points missing, which I am assuming will be answered with this Director's Cut.  Still, a very impressive movie.
B0002KQNJU|4.0|Hardtimes have hit the vampire community. Count Krolock (Ferdy Mayne) has had to resort to kidnapping to feed his flock. When traveling vampire hunter Professor Abronsius (the delightfully silly Jack MacGowran who also was in \\"The Exorcist\\" and \\"Doctor Zhivago\\") and his inept assistant Alfred (Polanski) stumble upon the village near Krolock's castle, they're forced into action to save the innkeeper's daughter Sarah (Sharon Tate). Since Alfred is smitten with the girl he braves the vampire's lair with the good doctor in tow. The good news...the know where the girl has been taken. The bad news...theres a lot of vampires between them and the girl.<br /><br />A delightful satire of Hammer horror films, \\"The Fearless Vampire Killers\\" becomes a comedy of errors from the very first moment. While it's funny, it also has some genuinely chilling moments mixed in with the comedy. Filled with wonderful performances from a very funny script by Polanski Gerard Brach(\\"Jean de Florette\\", \\"The Name of the Rose\\", \\"Tess\\")the wonderful cinematography of Douglas Slocombe (\\"Raiders of the Lost Ark\\")and artful direction of Polanski will keep you entertained.<br /><br />The print looks pretty good overall although there clearly has been some fading of the original negative and a color shift as well. Warner didn't use any digital filters to eliminate the analog defects of the original negative/print used here. There not a huge problem but evident. The mono soundtrack doesn't have quite the presence it should although it doesn't sound bad by any means. It just sounds....tinny. Perhaps a bit more compression would have beefed up the sound a bit for modern systems. It's not all that big a deal. The animated menu is delightful incorporating the original poster art.<br /><br />I first saw \\"The Fearless Vampire Killers\\" on a late night broadcast by CBS (the very same place I also got my first...taste..of \\"Dracula Has Risen from the Grave\\" and other Hammer horrors). I don't recall any animated opening titles for the film when I first saw it (perhaps that was the British release)so including them would have been a nice extra. Although it would probably be too much to ask Polanski to do a commentary track (given Sharon Tate's brutal murder by the Manson clan almost three years later), there are members of the cast still around who could have done a commentary track. The short vintage featurette provides an interesting glimpse into the making of the movie. There's no booklet included.<br /><br />All in all, I'm happy that the film is finally available on DVD after all these years. It was delightful then and still is after all these years. If you'd like to watch a very funny horror movie with a bit of slapstick added to the mix, I'd suggest fearlessly taking a bite out of this classic film.any animated opening titles for the film when I first saw it (perhaps that was the British release)so including them would have been a nice extra.

0790729628|4.0|A totally under-rated sci-fi work. Although the plot is a bit  <br />stodgy the underlying genre and scenery are exceptional. <br />The film, to be appreciated, must be viewed several times, each viewing focusing on different aspects of the production: <br />stage sets and neon,the Nexus 6 Androids and their place in human development or degradation,light and dark -    spectacular chiariscuro, dialogue, characters, music.
B0000AXE8I|1.0|Okay the first thing you need to know about the Matrix trilogy is that the first one was awesome, the second and third were not. That said let's find out why it was such pure drivel. <br /> <br />First, they took the prediction factor to an all-time high. Neo's in love, he has a choice between saving the world and the girl he loves. [Sounding like Spider-man on the bridge with the car and mary jane anyone] What does he do. Goes after the girl, because he can save the world after that. Other factors were predictable as well. We're driving down a freeway, Morpheus has a big sword facing an SUV, what's he going to do? Trinity is on a bike with no gun, how will she survive? Um. Pretty basic archetypical answers. Good guys have to win. They only die supporting their cause directly. <br /> <br />Second, the graphics in the first movie looked more realistic, more plausible even when we knew we were in the matrix. But in the second we go the way of Lucas. Over the top. Color intensity gone awry and it's a drab set up. A battle with a thousand Agent Smith's and not even a scratch or plausible looking scene when it was all digital. Even Gollum looked better back in the Fellowship. <br /> <br />Third, the cheesy \\"plot twist\\" that is the extensialistic approach. The first movie was all about acknowledging the fact that you have a choice. The Second is all about do you have one at all really? With Neo being forced to choose in a situation that already has a predetermined answer we will find out at the end of Revolutions. There was no significant development in the way of expanding and addressing another aspect of the philosophical reasons behind the plot.  <br /> <br />Fourth, the Hollywood influence felt in the movie. By hollywood influence I mean, the shoddy graphics, the staple dance scene, the intimate sex scene, and other worthless scenes not relevant to the esential idea of extensialism. There used to be a message in the first movie. The second one lost it. <br /> <br />Fifth, there was nothing unpredictable in the movie. [This was so bad that I had to mention it again.] Jada ditches boyfriend to lead a ship to support Lawerence's cause. Who doesn't see them getting back together to some extent in the end? Or the uh oh they have this big plan that must be pulled off exactly to prevent the building from blowing up, something won't go wrong will it?  <br /> <br />In the end, the movie entertains you on the lowest plain of existence, but it's not worthy of the Matrix precedent that the first movie established. If you think about it, only rent the movie. It'll save you a lot of money in the long run, because you won't watch it more than a once, unless you like pointless and predictable action flicks.
B000002HJD|1.0|Jim Morrison is a legend, he is not a poet.  This is the reason they took drugs in the 60s - how else do you make this crap sound good.
B0002IQHY8|5.0|Since shedding the \\"Project\\" suffix in the late 1980s (and thereby marking a parting of the ways between himself and longtime Project partner Eric Woolfson), Alan Parsons has released a number of albums under his own name-with mixed results. While Parsons' work throughout the 90s wasn't necessarily *bad*, it did lack a certain presence, a certain energy; A Valid Path seems to have succeeded where recent efforts had plateaued.<br /><br />A lot has to do with Parsons' new sound: In recent years, Alan's work has mostly stuck to the adult contemporary road-something like Fleetwood Mac meets a more amiable Pink Floyd. A Valid Path sets itself quite apart-but it shouldn't come as a surprise that his first truly unabashed electronica album should work so well. After all, he'd been using a variety of programming/sequencing techniques since the 1970s, and 1999's The Time Machine featured two predominantly electronic tracks, \\"The Time Machine\\" and \\"Far Ago and Long Away\\" (both of which were, arguably, the most interesting tracks on the album). In this sense, A Valid Path is a much-needed progression.<br /><br />As other reviewers have mentioned, this is not your typical AP album, so fans of his Project-era style need not apply. A Valid Path is heavy on the sampling and driving beats, but features a variety of more traditional APP sounds as well-particularly David Gilmour's guitar solo on \\"Return to Tunguska\\" and the retro drumbeat on \\"Tijuaniac.\\" There are two tracks which pass as remixes: \\"Mammagamma '04\\" and \\"A Recurring Dream Within a Dream,\\" both of which feature a hip sound that works quite well.<br /><br />A Valid Path is an excellent album, and comes off as the handiwork of an artist expanding into new musical directions rather than a rock veteran trying to massage life into an ailing music career.
0140277447|5.0|Just one thing to say. It may look like \\"It is obvious after reading the one star reviews from many Japanese citizens, that a significant group of Japanese have not fully accepted their countries guilt.\\" as one of the reviewers here pointed out. However, I, as a Japanese American presently living in Japan (a bit complicated!), would dare say those Japanese revisionists are just in a minority group ordinary people neglect or feel weird. They look distinct from the eyes outside Japan because they always yapping their heads off like a crazy pup, however, in my observations on those people for more than two decades, it is just like they are bathing in a deep community pond of frustration and complex, masterbating together. Actually, the newly published history textbook written from their point of view in late 1990's has never been chosen by any local School Boards all over Japan except for 2 out of countless. They are, I would say, Japanese KKK. They are history as hopefully KKK is in the US.
0671027387|3.0|Granted, the US may sorta challenge it, but Canadian readers will have to suspend disbelief in a major way to get through some of the glaring oversights, inaccuracies and omissions in this book since Ellesmere Island is generally accepted as a part of a sovereign Canada - this small fact completely discredits the entire premise of this book. Still, by fictionalizing the location in my own mind to some &quot;other place&quot;, I actually quite enjoyed the story. Still, geographical mistakes are disappointing from an author who is pretty insistent about how factual his background is.
B00005A46T|1.0|Lets get one thing straight; Slipknot. Is. Not. Heavy. Music. They simply aren't. They may think of themselves as heavy, but they're wrong. Screaming and playing loudly, does not make you heavy. Got that straight? Now on to the review. <br /> <br />Slipknot's guitarists sound like rusty nails going through a wood chipper, and their DJ has absolutely no variety. The drummer is actually okay. He has some potential. <br /> <br />The fact that it takes 9 people , to make music this bad, is emberrassing. Why do you need so many percussionists? And, a sampler? Couldn't the DJ just do that?
B000002BE9|5.0|I only recently rediscovered Fiona Apple. I'm ashamed to admit I almost forgot about her. This album is truly a gem. I can listen to it from begining to end and never skip a track. I love the elements of blues and jazz and the lyrics are so honest and poetic. Also, her voice is very versatile and powerful. \\"Never Is A Promise\\" is what made me obsessed with this album. That song is hauntingly beautiful. Fiona is amazingly talented and a true artist. I recommend this album to anyone who wants to hear what I would say is one of the best albums of the past 10 years.
B0002OERI0|5.0|I have been a Green Day fan since the beginning.  This is one of their best.  They have completely out done themselves with this one.  I love the fact that it's a rock opera of sorts.  Listening to the songs in order tells a fasinating story.  I've been waiting for this cd for ages.  This is amazing, even for the non-Green Day fans out there, you need to get this one.
B0002OERI0|5.0|Out of no where, out of oblivion, Green Day have become my new obsession and \\"American Idiot\\" my definite favourite album of 2004. It's as simple as that. I knew who the band were but couldn't name one of their albums a couple of months ago. Then I heard the new album's first single, and I was bowled over. I bought the album two weeks after it came out and was at No.1 in the US and UK, and what I discovered was a total revelation. I'm a fan of rock music from bands such as Oasis, Radiohead, Red Hot Chili Peppers and Nirvana, but Green Day are seriously up there amongst the best with this new album.<br /><br />It is obvious that a lot of time and effort has been put into this album - it's flawless. I was particularly intrigued by the two 9-minute songs on the album, because it portrayed a confident approach to the music - that a band of this status could pull something off without falling flat on their faces. People have criticised this album for attacking George Bush and his decisions in a post-September 11th world where terrorism is a daily crisis. However, references towards this are made subtly and work extremely well - they have the facts and public opinion to back up their statements, and they are saying that they do love America as a nation, but not what it has become over the past three years.<br /><br />American Idiot opens with the lead single, \\"American Idiot.\\" This is a heavy and upbeat rock song that will no doubt become an anthem over the next year or so. It really does deserve it, because it's a fantastic song to capture people's attention. The video is great too - Billie Joe looks so hot...the only man I've ever found sexy in mascara! Up next is \\"Jesus Of Suburbia,\\" the first of the two 9-minute masterpieces. This is the best of the two and is made up of five smaller songs, the first being \\"Jesus Of Suburbia,\\" followed by \\"City Of The Damned\\" which is a brilliant mid-tempo rocker, followed by the upbeat \\"I Don't Care\\" which is even heavier. The song then slows down for the awesome \\"Dearly Beloved,\\" which is SO catchy! This in then followed by \\"Tales Of Another Broken Home,\\" which is the final 'song' on this epic, and it's just as good as what has gone before it. \\"Holiday\\" is the third track and has a brilliant beat, disturbingly 'happy' lyrics sung in an obvious ironic tone and a wicked rap that totally rips Bush apart. \\"Boulevard Of Broken Dreams\\" is probably the best song on the whole album, because it has a real anthemic feel to it of open spaces and a grand perspective not matched by anything else on the album.<br /><br />\\"Are We The Waiting\\" was one of my favourites to begin with, but I don't like it as much now - it has a real opera-rock feel to it, and reminds me of a Queen song. \\"St. Jimmy\\" is an up-tempo number with some great riffs, whilst \\"Give Me Novacaine\\" is a brilliant mid-tempo song with a very harmonised chorus. The song has an almost Caribbean flair to it, which is a nice change. This is followed by the brilliant \\"She's A Rebel,\\" another one of my favourites on the album. The song's lyrics are also interesting because they relate to the album cover, \\"She's the symbol of resistance, and she's holding on my heart like a hand grenade.\\" The song is hardly two minutes long before the next song plays it. It's called \\"Extraordinary Girl,\\" and is one of my favourites on the whole album. Not many people like this song from reviews that I have read, but I like it because it dares to be experimental and the results are rather pleasing. The Oriental-theme works very well, and the chorus is very memorable, especially the lyrics, \\"She gets so sick of crying.\\"<br /><br />\\"Letterbomb\\" is not one of my favourites, but this is such an amazing album that overall it's still good. \\"Wake Me Up When September Ends\\" is another one of my favourites on the album here, and I think it's highly unlikely that this song was made TRACK 11 by coincidence! The song itself is a very mid-tempo and heartfelt song with a slow guitar that works brilliantly.

The song itself is fairly upbeat and works well to close this masterpiece epic.<br /><br />OVERALL GRADE: 10/10<br /><br />I would definitely say that this is my favourite album of 2004, because it's fresh and new and exciting for me, and most importantly, it has a theme. It has a real message that Green Day weren't afraid to express, because they knew the music was good enough to shine through and that people would see the album's genius. I would definitely recommend this album to anyone interested in Green Day, because this is sure to be a big starting point for many newcomers.

B000084T18|5.0|This cd is crazy. It is one of my top five in my very seclusive cd list.  I understand where some people are coming from with the whole mainstream rap thing but 50 isn't mainstream. Only a few songs are but you have to be to make money so it's alright. But I know straight fire when I hear it and that is what this cd is.  just like nearly everyone owns the chronic everyone needs to own this album.  By the way the other cd's on my list are All eyez on me-Tupac,Black Star,Enter the 36 chambers-Wu Tang,and Marshall Mathers Lp-Eminem
6301868684|5.0|Over the summer I purchased and read Hubert Selby Jr.'s \\"Last Exit to Brooklyn\\". It was the first book I had read for pleasure since high school. I also only bought it because the film Requiem for a Dream was astonishing, and because it wasnt at that particular bookstore. Anywho, I read LETB in about a week, which is super fast for me, and was intrigued enough to go out and watch the film.    I had never heard of Uli Edel but was curious to see how well the book was illustrated through film. From the opening shot of the three military men walking through the dark streets to the Greeks to the factory to the strike office, things seemed to have been pulled straight from the book. If you have read the book you know how it can be sometimes quite difficult to read Selby's writing style, considering there are pages upon pages of text in all caps and run-on sentences up the wazoo, so a visual illustration really did a good job of bringing some confusing parts of the book to life.    Jennifer Jason Leigh gave a good performance as the infamous Tralala, Jerry Orbach was always refreshing to watch, but I think I liked the portrayal of Harry Black the best (I think it was Stephen Lang). As in the book, his \\"chapter\\", along with Tralala's, were the longest, and the two characters were also the most intertwined in the other stories, so they also got a majority of the screen time in the film. Oh, and Burt Young was well cast, too. He seems to thrive on the grumpy-caring-jerk-semi womanizer type character quite well.     I know others who have read the book or seen the movie have been put off by its unflattering portrait of the Brooklyn working class 60 years ago. Im only 22, and not the biggest history buff, so because of my little knowledge of the time I really cant form an opinion of how well it interprets the people and the places, or if much of it was dramatized, or if the stories told just represented a handful of the population in Brooklyn. But regradless, I enjoyed the less than perfect lifestyle and the struggles and sacrifices our characters endured to achieve their goals. I live near an upper middle class area, so lots of people take things for granted, and I think thats why Im drawn to these types of books and films.     But anyway, I liked this film; and I liked the book, too. Its not one of those films (or books) that you can watch or read everyday because the content strikes like a hammer and stays with you long after, kind of like Requiem, but I feel I am a better person for experiencing \\"Last Exit to Brooklyn\\".
B000003S0D|1.0|Okay, I am not sure how I came to possess this cd, but while cleaning up in the basement I found it and popped it in. I'm sorry, maybe King Crimson is an acquired taste, but I found \\"Lizard\\" to be hardly listenable. I mean the first three songs sound as if you have a recording of a band of insane asylum inmates who have no clue what \\"melody\\" means, and if they happen to stumble across something resembling coherant music, a jarring keyboard riff will disrupt the song. At times it sounds as if each member of the band is playing a different song that does not gel together. And to top it off you have the lead singer who sounds...well he sound just like some middle aged guy singing in the shower, he has no range, outside of \\"whisper\\" and \\"monotone boredom\\". Jon Anderson from Yes makes a cameo here, a brief one that only confirms my belief that Jon Anderson sang on every record that came out in 1970. I like Captain Beefheart, I like Gentle Giant, so I am not a stranger to off the wall music, but this wasn't off the wall....it's just awful. Maybe I am missing something, but I can't imagine anyone sober or sane listening to this thing!!
B00005JNEI|5.0|Although I was aware in some measure of what I experienced when viewing this DVD on the day I received it from amazon.com, yet it all came into focus.  At the end of the full contents of the dvd, including features, etc., I sat back and in my mind I let it all sink in.  I must have spent an hour just digesting all that I viewed.  The opening, showing a close up of Bush, sitting there in front of the children, with his usual photo op, staged and choreographed as has been the practice of this presidency, worked in reverse and actually showed the naked truth for a change. Here was the seven minute void, showing an presidential aid whispering in his ear that the country had been attacked. The close up showing Bush's expression and demeanor,the eye movement and freeze, captured by the video was startling, the picking up of a book and the vacant stare, all that was missing was a, \\"dunce cap.\\" Without someone pulling his strings and feeding him hidden written notes.  Here was the birth of a self proclaimed, SUPER SUPER COMMANDER-IN CHIEF.\\" This video clip when viewed world wide will definitely not leave a positive impression to all the terrorists lurking in the shadows.  The aforementioned was in my opinion a highlight of this dvd.  Of course all the other video clips and speeches were also of great significance. <br /> <br />The vido clip which described  the joint appearance of Bush and Cheney re:9/11 so called investigation by a committee held behind closed doors, not under oath, was described by Bush as he appeared before reporters, \\"as a friendly conversation,\\" or words to that effect, was extremely revealing.  A reporter asked if appearing jointly with Cheney was a way to keep their stories straight, Bush as is his wont, fixed a sickly grin and uttered something ridiculous. <br /> <br />This documentary was excellent and I would personally rate it in excess of *****.   <br /> <br />Finally, this documentary has been critized by many of the younger generation who withadoring eyes, wave banners depicting, \\"we love Bush,\\" and, \\"four more years,\\" which to me equals, \\"four more arrears.\\"  If there were a draft, and there was a strong chance that these banner wavers would follow their Commander-in-Chief and share the agony of what is going on in Iraq, I truly believe the displays would take on another meaning. <br /> <br />I mean to share this dvd with a few friends of different ages, just to see and learn their reaction. <br /> <br />My profound thanks to, \\"Michael Moore,\\" who made this possible. <br /> <br />Robert Lyons, Reno, Nevada <br />
B00006LPER|5.0|The French have a way of creating films full of people you would never want to know, should not want to know, and if you saw them would fail to see what lies below the surface.  In other words, they explore parts of the human condition that Hollywood wouldn't touch.  Huppert brilliantly realizes the portrayal of an emotionally twisted woman:  maniacally focused on her art, from a bizarre household she cannot escape, and unable to form loving relationships.  SHe is at times sad, cruel, and sexually experimental.  However, as a reflection of her loneliness and pain, there is nothing whatsoever titillating about her sexuality.<br /><br />The ride is rough and it isn't for everyone.  This is excellent psycho-drama, destined to be a classic that will never achieve a wide audience.  Recommended with caution.
B000002UDB|5.0|1967 was a heavy year for rock & roll. The Doors, Pink Floyd, Jimi Hendrix, the Moody Blues, the Velvet Underground, Cream, Jefferson Airplane... all catapulted to the forefront of music and culture. No description of the Summer of Love is complete without the Beatles - Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band was one of the greatest milestones in the history of popular music. However, the Fab Four didn't stop there, releasing multiple landmark singles and making a musical TV movie, among other things. If not as celebrated as Sgt. Pepper, these latter efforts were equally impressive - the music anyway, which resulted in Magical Mystery Tour (1967).    This version of Magical Mystery Tour, the one accepted as official for CD release in 1987, was originally one of the Beatles' American label Capitol's notorious \\"jig-saw\\" albums - British LPs cut up and spliced together with non-album hits to generate more sales. In this case they took the English EP soundtrack to the failed TV movie Magical Mystery Tour and appended contemporary singles. This may be the only time Capitol got it right. For if MMT's \\"score\\" contained some real gems, it also had its share of lesser numbers. Pairing them with the Beatles' revolutionary '67 singles may do little to bring out the \\"filler's\\" admitted charms, but it certainly makes for a much better album. In fact, despite its patchwork history, Magical Mystery Tour is one of the Beatles' finest hours.    The complexity and psychedelia of Sgt. Pepper and Revolver remain wholly intact, perhaps even reach their zenith, here, and both halves of Lennon-McCartney perform in full force. Paul chips in his increasingly sophisticated classical rock: who hasn't heard the melancholic Fool on the Hill, or perhaps the ultimate fusion of art and pop, Penny Lane? Meanwhile John makes the most of psychedelic drugs to weave the surrealistic mazes of Strawberry Fields Forever and I Am the Walrus. Not to mention All You Need Is Love, which, performed live on the very first worldwide satellite broadcast, may well be the 1960s' definitive anthem. As mentioned before, there are a few \\"duds\\" - e.g. the trippy instrumental Flying - but it's the Beatles, who even at their worst (which this is not) are listenable after all. And last but certainly not least, George Martin just continues to prove he's the greatest producer ever to walk the earth.    It's not as groundbreaking, thematic, or widely hailed as Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band. But to my ears Magical Mystery Tour may in fact be the better album, if not from a historical standpoint than from one of sheer quality. It's most definitely tied to its time, but what a time it was...
B00003CXCT|1.0|The new changes in images, but what i really mind is the music! the music has been changed in son many classic scenes...0h man, It really disturbes me... Various scenes have lost their original feeling, what a shame.
0156027321|4.0|What a great story! I highly recommend this imaginative and creative journey through a young man's struggle to survive. This book will challenge one's imagination and educate one's mind. Personally, it was a thought provoking and highly emotional novel. I finished this novel months ago, yet my mind still wanders back to the horrifying yet inspirational events that Pi experiences. It is a story about life and the instinctive desire to live. \\"Life of Pi\\" is a compelling story about believing in the impossible. I think this book should be incorporated into the school systems across the world.
B00005JNEI|5.0|This is one great film, I recomend it to anyone who wants to hear the truth about this so called President of ours.  Vote Bush for EX-President in 2004!!!!!
B0002OERI0|5.0|I knew that there was something deeper about this entire album than my first time listen would indicate - the lyrics didn't quite add up to what you would think they were saying.  Finally, on the fifth listen, I finally got it - this is a subliminal message, Shakespeare style, sharpened to expertise.  The lyrics now fit perfectly like a complete and intricate jigsaw puzzle, and the picture is of a devious \\"say anything\\" political party trying to regain control, and using deception and hysteria through the liberal media, and without shame or apology, to create undue tension and jerk us around like the American idiots they think we are.   <br /> <br />The first song, \\"American Idiot\\", gives a complete preview: \\"Can you hear the sound of hysteria?  Welcome to a new kind of tension. Everything isn't meant to be okay. One nation controlled by the media\\".  <br /> <br />Next, \\"Jesus of Suburbia\\" further criticizes the liberal \\"holy message\\" with \\"This hurricane of f**king lies, I lost my faith to this, This town that don't exist, I don't feel any shame, I won't apologize\\".   <br /> <br />Then the Dem Party and their hopeful leader are labeled \\"St. Jimmy\\": \\"Jimmy's comin' down across the alleyway, He's insubordinate. Coming at you on the count.\\"  <br /> <br />And those that blindly follow this misleading message are lectured in \\"Letterbomb\\": \\"Where have all the bastards gone? Collecting unemployment checks You're f**king only along for the ride\\" And everything is tied up expertly with \\"You're not the Jesus of Suburbia, The St. Jimmy's opinion of Your father's raise and your mother's love, That's made the idiot America\\"  <br /> <br />Finally, Greenday predicts the wisdom and revolt of the \\"American Idiot\\", and the November defeat of the Dems with `The Death Of St. Jimmy\\": \\"Do you think what you need is a crutch, In the crowd of pain. St. Jimmy comes without any shame, He says we're f**ked up? Jimmy died today, He blew out his brains into the bay, And nobody cares\\".   <br /><br />And for those who lean so far left towards anarchy, \\"Are We Waiting\\" digs into this immature ideology with the sarcastic: \\"how about coming off that cloud. Put in perspective. Our sectionalist anarchy could overcome the factions\\".   <br /> <br />I believe I know why Greenday felt it necessary to spread this message in such a subconscious way - Most of their fans are ideological lightweights in liberal political thought, who are still developing into mature and thoughtful adults, and this is a gentle way of guiding them along the path of clear responsible thinking without lecturing, confrontation, and without the possibility of alienation by the followers and having the message rejected.  As Mark Antony expertly altered mass opinion in favor of his friend with his \\"I come to bury Caesar, not to praise him\\" speech, Greenday does the same with American idiot, Shakespeare style. <br />
B000002HPT|5.0|I truly believe Dream Theater is one of the most talented and under-rated bands I've ever heard.  Every album of theirs is a work of art.  However I'll join the rest of the reviews here by saying that this album is not your typical DT album and is truly an attempt at a more mainstream audience.  However, it's not a bad record at all.  Most of the songs fall around 6 minutes long, which is fairly short for DT (there are a couple of 12-13 minute epics). But what makes this more mainstream is the lack of long guitar/keyboard/drum solos that make Dream Theater who they are.  Instead, the album seems to focus on melody. <br /> <br />The result of this is an almost 80's rock metal sound throughout most of the record.  Some songs sound like old Metallica, others like Def Leppard...but behind it all, you can still easily recognize Dream Theater.   <br /> <br />For me, the best tracks on here are \\"New Millennium\\", \\"You Not Me\\", \\"Hollow Years\\", the sappy but brilliant \\"Take Away My Pain\\" and the grand finale, \\"Trial of Tears\\" which is simply beautiful.  This should not be anyone's introduction to Dream Theater, but it's definitely a gorgeous album worth listening to over and over. <br /> <br />On a side note, I bought this album for \\"Hollow Years\\" after I heard the track on DT's Live at Budokan DVD.  If you've never seen them live, I'd recommend getting this DVD as well.  You've never seen such raw talent until you watch this!
B000002KOJ|4.0|Joni Mitchell starts to show her musical genius in her second album. It includes one of her best songs, \\"Both Sides Now\\". There is a lot here for everyone to enjoy including, \\"The Gallery\\" and \\"The Song About the Midway\\". Her albums continue to get better, as they should, but this really is a classic album with a great album cover by Joni.
B00009Y2K9|5.0|Lagrimas Negras is one of the greatest albums of all time, you can not imagine how great this combination of a Cuban piano player (Bebo Valdez R.I.P) with a Spanish flamenco singer (Diego Cigala)sounds until you hear it. <br />I love jazz music and its actually my favorite style of music, but this innovation of music its just great, and the lyrics of the songs are beautiful too. <br />I saw the Lagrimas Negras Concert in the Auditorio Nacional of Mxico, and i can tell you that it was the best performance i've ever seen in my life, in fact i cried with the \\"Vete de mi\\" song, i hope that Diego Cigala continues the history of this great music with Bebo's son \\"Chucho\\" Valdez, bacause finally someone is making something different and beautiful.
B00005K3O4|4.0|It plays like a typical late 50's sci-fi film.  Teenage couple explores strange falling star.  Old man gets to it first, and becomes the first victim of the alien terror.  Teenagers try to make the authorities believe them.  Eventually, the police come around, but of course, not until after much damage has already been done.     The alien spacecraft resembles a gigantic circus tent. Which is fitting since the aliens are Killer Klowns.  These Klowns go on a hunt through a quiet little town, killing people as they find them and preserving their bodies in giant cotton candy cocoons.  They use balloon animals, popcorn shooters, and even shadow puppets as weapons of death. The special effects and art design are actually quite good for such a low budget film.  And the Klowns have to be one of cheesy science fiction's greatest creations:  big, ugly, and grotesque, with wide grinning mouths, sharp teeth, and devilish eyes.     Now it is true that the acting is mediocre, but I felt it actually enhanced the enjoyment of the film. This film deserves the cult following over it has earned.
B00005JMJ4|2.0|\\"So you mean to tell me you don't like this movie Ray?\\" <br /> <br />\\"It's boring as hell.\\" <br /> <br />\\"YOU?  Ray? Thought this movie was boring?\\" <br /> <br />Yes, it's funny, people know my love for indie films, watching my share of unknown, but truly profound movies.  Yes I surprise them when I say this movie is utter garbage.   <br /> <br />Maybe I had a hard time identifying with the characters.  Charlotte should claim the award for the most angnst-ridden, boring, pretentious girl ever created in a movie.  For the love of god, do something exciting.  Bob Harris, interesting, yet I found his potential to be hindered by this strange \\"relationship\\" he develops with Charlotte. <br /> <br />Sofia Coppola struggles to find empathy from a very apathetic couple (as well as the audience that's bored to tears watching this garbage).  Here's a good idea to make this movie \\"indie\\", add a few elements that other movies do and pawn it off as something new, creative, and anti-Hollywood. <br /> <br />I stole this section from Sofia Coppola herself.  It was hilighted on book called, \\"Indie movies for dummies who are children of famous directors who have connections\\": <br /> <br />-include obscure music  <br />-non-conventional ending <br />-take a comedic actor and make him more \\"serious\\" <br />-lots and lots of angst (you can never forget to add a dose of this in an \\"indie\\" film.  You'll lose cred immediately) <br />-silence, slow pace, and complete bordem <br /> <br />Then end it inconclusively, yeah, make the audience wonder.  You'll get the intellectual types debating about the underlying symbolic meaning of it all.  For the love of god shut the hell up!   <br /> <br />WOW, what a sack of crap.  I'm lucky to have traded this garbage in for 8 bucks.  Never will I buy a movie without renting first again. <br /> <br />Do yourself a favor and watch a Jim Jarmusch film or two, Coen brothers, Terry Zwigoff, etc. etc. <br /> <br />There are some many better movies out there unknown to the public, yet one receives some critical claim and next thing you know a bunch of poseurs think they've discovered e=MC*squared <br /> <br />P.S. extra star added for the nice cinematography and atmosphere
B00005JNEI|5.0|Should be required viewing for every American. Infuriating. Funny. Entertaining. Heartbreaking. One can agree or disagree with Moore, but this is a powerful film. A little overlong, perhaps, but a must see documentary. Thank God, for Michael Moore!
B000002C1W|4.0|I have been a Pink FLoyd fan for over 20 years and still can't understand why Floyd fans can't respect this album.  <br />Finally after 20 years, Pink Floyd continues on without Roger Waters at the helm. Since the addition of Gilmour I believe Pink Floyd became complete. Syd was good, but not great. Gilmour completed this band. Obviously Waters must have been afraid of Gilmours greatness and pretty much took over all the lyric writing after the Dark Side era, eventually taking over on The Wall. Don't get me wrong, I love Waters and all he contributed. But I find him selfish as well and should have let the band contribute more in the late 70's. <br />Floyd fan knock Gilmours efforts to move on and continue with the great Pink Floyd image and awesome concerts. AMLOR showed me an excellant push forward from the stubborn Waters who just wanted to take full control and use Gilmours excellence in his guitar greatness, pretty much taking all the credit. <br />Learning To Fly is very moving and Floydish. One Slip, On The Turning Away, and Sorrow complete this excellent effort Gilmour, Wright, and  Mason bring to its fans. <br />I only wish Waters would have considered getting over his past problems and became a band with his fellow members and moved on. They easily had 10 more years of greatness. But he didn't, and the 3 remaining members moved on and showed us they could put on one hell of a show. And they did!
B00005JNEI|4.0|I would first like to say Thank you Mr. Moore. I thank you for never ever backing down when we were all supposed to be \\"rallying behind our commander in chief\\". Whether it was release \\"Stupid White Men\\", or this movie, you are a brave man. Plus, your movie raked in over $100 Million! Let's see \\"Michael Moore Hates America\\" outdo that.  <br />As far as the movie itself. Truthfully, I knew a lot of the stuff that was presented in this movie. Not all of it; the stuff I didn't know was more shocking then what I did. The footage of the senate floor was very appaling. I couldn't believe that not one senator came forward. Where were you Russ Feingold? The Iraq footage was equally shocking. Wait, no, a little more shocking. These last four years have been hard on us all. Are we prepared, physically, financially, and emotionally for Four More Years? <br />This is not Moore's best movie. I still say that Roger and Me is the best movie he has made to date. Dude, Where's My Country? is also not Moore's best, although the title was hysterical. I have to say that Downsize This! is Moore's best book. Regardless, keep fighting the good fight, Mr. Moore.
B000000YG5|5.0|If you're a veteran you have this album, if you're just getting into jazz you NEED it. It's just an amazing album of improvisation and fun. It features some great musicians matched only (in my opinion) by the John Coltrane quartet and Miles Davis quintet. Rollins does amazing and crazy, yet controlled solos (which separates him from 'Trane, as Trane was just a loose cannon). Max Roach is also truly amazing on this album, getting solos in 2 or 3 of the songs. <br /> <br />The album opens with a light and happy caribbean tune, St. Thomas, that quickly turns into a swing tune after a great mid-song solo by Roach. Following this is You Don't Know what Love Is, a slower, more traditional jazz classic. It's probably my least favorite song on the album, not because its bad but just because the rest of the songs really seem to shine more. Strode Rode is an amazing swing piece featuring a great solo by Tommy Flannagan. Moritat (Mac the Knife) is another jazz essential as well. Blue 7 is purely a solo song not unlike something you would hear off of Kind of Blue. I havent really gone into extreme detail as when I listen to this cd, it really all flows together for me. I love it. It's a great cd to listen carefully to or to just put on and forget about. If you want jazz, you will want this cd.
B000002KHF|5.0|I'll always remember having this played by my mum in our kitchen as I was growing up. Even before I bought my first cd (hell,  even before cds were around!) I remember this album being played and loving \\"Into The Mystic\\" and \\"Moondance\\"... I suppose I didn't pay attention to much of the other songs. Recently, as I began to listen to Van, firstly buying Astral Weeks, then this, then Into the Music etc, I was made aware that this album is a very complete classic. About a year ago, the band I was in did \\"And It Stoned Me\\" as a cover, and while I didn't know the arrangements, I found myself knowing the words and changes. That this amazing song opens the album is a very bold statement from Morrison, for to live up to that premise the album would need to be of at least that quality of that song. Is it? Absolutely.  <br /> <br />In between the three true classics of this album (\\"And It Stoned Me\\", \\"Moondance\\" and \\"Into the Mystic\\"), songs such as \\"Crazy Love\\" (another one that EVERYONE knows, but maybe don't know who sang it), \\"Caravan\\" (which I first heard the Band perform with Van on \\"The Last Waltz\\"), \\"Brand New Day\\" etc. cement the status of this album as a true classic. In truth, the second half of the album doesn't live up to the opening 5 songs, but that is a minor quibble made more obsolete given the standard of that opening quintet.  <br /> <br />I would argue that the lead into the chorus of \\"... Mystic\\" is one of the most fluid, impressive vocal performances ever committed to tape, and the rest of the album doesn't lag too far behind. While albums like Astral Weeks provide epic songs with superb vocals, I know that (while to me, Astral is his best) his voice on that album can grate for some people. This is possibly his most accessible work in these terms at least. <br /> <br />In my opinion, Morrison created better albums, (\\"Astral Weeks\\", \\"Into The Music\\", possibly even \\"Veedon Fleece\\"), but the universal appeal and respect fo this album has always been there more so than with any of his other works. <br /> <br />A classic, plain and simple.
B000002KMY|5.0|...you won't buy this album, because Ozzy isn't on it, it isn't \\"Paranoid\\", \\"War Pigs\\", and \\"Iron Man\\", and that means it's not a Black Sabbath album, right?  Nonsense! <br /> <br />This was their second (and last) studio album with Ronnie James Dio (until 1992's excellent but ill-fated \\"Dehumanizer\\") and by this time Dio really was starting to establish himself as the man who had revitalised Sabbath.  Unfortunately, when you have two people as strong-willed as Ronnie James Dio and Tony Iommi, well, it just can't last, as \\"Dehumanizer\\" proved. <br /> <br />Is it as good as \\"Heaven and Hell\\" (my all-time favourite album, period)?  Mostly, yes, though it is different.  It's darker, heavier and, ironically, more like old Black Sabbath than \\"Heaven and Hell\\" was. <br /> <br />The most notable difference is on the drum throne: out goes Bill Ward with his substance abuse and emotional problems (his parents had both passed away within months of each other - enough to drive almost anyone over the edge, poor guy).  In comes Vinnie Appice (brother of Carmine, of course, but in my opinion a far, far better drummer though much less famous - I certainly couldn't have seen Vinnie play on Rod Stewart's DISCO \\"Do Ya Think I'm Sexy?\\").  It wasn't a total \\"throw him in and hope he floats\\" situation, though.  Vinnie had replaced Bill halfway through the North American leg of the \\"Heaven and Hell\\" tour and was slotting in very well with the band.  His drumming here is above reproach - pounding, complex and imaginative.  He's just as good live as I know from personal experience at Sabbath and Dio shows.  Why he doesn't get a writing credit is beyond me as the songs would not be the same without him. <br /> <br />Tony Iommi has said that the entire band were suffering from drug problems during the recording, including Sabbath's finest producer, Martin Birch.  If so, they hid it well, because the material is generally cohesive and powerful.  I've already mentioned Appice's prowess.  Dio is on top form vocally, Iommi provides crushing riffs and fluid solos and Geezer Butler is upfront in a way that he hadn't been since the early recordings. <br /> <br />\\"Turn Up The Night\\" - First cousin to \\"Neon Knights\\".  A fast trademark RJD rocker that wouldn't have been out of place on \\"Holy Diver.\\" <br /> <br />\\"Voodoo\\" - A little slower, more classic-Sabbath.  Vinnie powers the song along nicely.  Shows up on \\"Live Evil\\" with some additional music and lyrics. <br /> <br />\\"The Sign Of The Southern Cross\\" - A true EPIC and one of Sabbath's finest moments.  Begins with gentle acoustic guitar and then absolutely crushes the listener.  Dio's lyrical imagery is appropriately terrifying and Vinnie is at his best drumming-wise.  Just enough keyboard blurbs from Geoff Nicholls to provide colour in the background. <br /> <br />\\"E5150\\" - Early cassette pressings had this titled as \\"EV150\\", incidentally.  Apparently it translates from ancient Latin as \\"evil\\" and was Geezer's idea (no kidding, his bass really smacks one in the face here).  It's a suitably creepy instrumental but the album's low point. <br /> <br />\\"The Mob Rules\\" - Another high-energy metal classic.  This was originally written for the animated movie \\"Heavy Metal\\" (if you've seen the movie, you'll get the lyrical imagery more) and is a re-recorded version.  I prefer the version on the filmtrack slightly because it's a bit more raw. <br /> <br />\\"Country Girl\\" - Very, very good musically but weaker lyrically.  As some have said, it's a bit like some of RJD's Elf-era lyrics.  He says he often writes whilst watching sports.  I wonder if he was watching the University of Alabama play as he was writing this (\\"don't sail away on the Crimson Tide\\")! <br /> <br />\\"Slipping Away\\" - The band really gell on this one.  Excellent song and some classic call-and-response soloing from Tony and Geezer in the middle section.  Guitarists and bassists, listen and learn from the masters. <br /> <br />\\"Falling Off The Edge OfThe World\\" - A little like \\"The Sign Of The Southern Cross\\" but faster.  Dio conveys the images of insanity every bit as well as Ozzy, and with a far better voice. <br /> <br />\\"Over And Over\\" - Some slow blues to close out the album.  Dio sounds quite mournful here but the highlight is Iommi speeding away during the outro. <br /> <br />This album was, of course, sadly, the end of the Dio era.  I remember hearing on MTV in 1983 that Dio and Appice had left and was shocked.  I also mused at that time that Sabbath might get Ian Gillan, which is exactly what happened! <br /> <br />A very fine album.  Not as successful commercially as \\"Heaven and Hell\\", and not as successful as Ozzy was with his solo career at this time...but, then again, these were real musicians who weren't decapitating bats and doves to draw attention to themselves...
B00008S2VG|2.0|No wonder she needs to lip synch in her shows. As it is Madonna cannot sing a note. She never will. It would take a miracle and maybe channeling the great Billie Holiday, in order to make this stinky album sound passable. Madonna's a hasbeen. Get over it- move on to the real talents out there. I'm giving it 2 stars, just because Madonna has the guts to put out another record and punish the public.
0790729628|1.0|Movies like minority report, i, robot, the fifth element(stupid), and other futuristic films owe alot to this becuase of the hover cars and huge cities that have basically no visible ground, but this movie is the worst of the all.  Ridley Scott can make a hell of a movie (alien, gladiator...) but he should stick with the epics and thankfully he seems to be going in that direction because he is making 3 more historical epics that i know of (kingdom of heaven, hannibal, not lector, the conqueror dude, and gladiator 2, also he is planning on a movie called metropoli which i think stars russel crowe and is also a hist epic) and alien was a great sci fi horror film, but this sci fi so called action movie (even though it has no real or half decent action in it at all) sucks terrbily.  It is boring, weird, the is no fathomable plot, no drama or likeable character esspecially that nexus 6 guy (what the hell was he doin in a ridley scott film, hes a worse actor the steven seagal almost), no action, pointless nudity, an the supposed unhappy ending in this directors cut is basically happy, they are together at the end whats so unhappy, its pointless because there is an attempt at a love story (which suck anyway) but this is just ridiculous.  The whole movie feels incomplete and really should have never been \\"completed\\" or even made in the first place.  1 out of a 10 for the visuals (which arent that great) and inspiring other much better films.
B0001ZMWQO|5.0|The moment I heard a sample of Franz Ferdinand's, a four-piece Scottish band, music on iTunes, I couldn't wait to actually buy their album. Yes, I had to get the physical CD instead of the AAC encoded files from iTunes, which are great, but being the tactile animal I am, I had to have this CD :-P<br /><br />I have been listening to it nonstop ever since. Talk about addictive tunes and smart lyrics! Franz Ferdinand is to 2004 what Evanescence was to 2003 and what The Smiths were to the 80's: a unique, fresh, hip and very addictive sound. FF, however, has more of bassline and scratchy guitars sound that I just love! Here is my take on the songs:<br /><br />Jacqueline: Acoustic intro followed by sheer rock coolness.<br /><br />Tell her Tonight: One of the most addicitive songs on this album. Period!<br /><br />Take me Out: One of the reasons this album is superb. Just listen to it!<br /><br />The Dark of the Matinee: Very addictive! I sing it all the time in the shower!<br /><br />Auf Acshe: For disco lovers, you will love this song. It's so not-tired-70's-disco sound. One of my favorite songs on this album.<br /><br />Cheating on You: I am A D D I C T E D to this song. The guitar magic has gotton me under a spell.<br /><br />This Fire: Fire for your feet. We're getting down!<br /><br />Darts of Pleasure: My absolute favorite song on this album! Period!<br /><br />Michael: Ummm, who's gay in Franz Ferdinand? It's a catchy song with very interesting lyrics!<br /><br />Come on Home: Blondie anyone?<br /><br />40': I just love this song!<br /><br />I give FF A for producing a classic like this. Ohh, you cannot miss their EPs as well, especially:<br /><br />Words so Leisured: A short, acoustic version of Darts of Pleasure. So worth having!<br /><br />Take Me Out (Morgan Geist Re-Version): Talk about nonstop dancing!
B0002VKZL6|4.0|The first time I heard \\"Shangri-La\\" I was disappointed. After the second listen I thought: groovy. Now I've heard it 6 or 7 times and I like it, a lot. The the entire CD is extremely slick. A few songs are all time great Straits/Knopfler songs, in my book. <br /> <br />There is guitar; there are no Knopfler-solos. A pity; the only reason this CD didn't get 5 stars. Genre? Folk-Rock. If you are a Knopfler fan then buy this CD! You won't be disappointed, after a second listen.
B0002VEWA6|4.0|Perhaps the most pertinent thing to note about \\"Shrek\\" is that it's not a kid's film.  That may be \\"old news,\\" so to speak, but some are still not aware of that; I wasn't.  I rented this to watch with my 6-year-old daughter, and the film opens with a lovely little fairy tale about a princess and a charming prince who find true love.  Shrek then crushes the storybook and says with bitterness, \\"Well, THAT will never happen.\\" <br /> <br />My 6-year-old gave me a look as if I had killed Santa Claus.  Fortunately she got past that and enjoyed the film, but its humor is occasionally mature enough that I wished I'd chosen a different film. <br /> <br />\\"Shrek\\" is for older children and for us grownups.  It has the occasional mild profanity and sly sexual reference that make it less desirable for tots.  However, having said all that, yeah, it's a hoot. <br /> <br />Shrek (voice of Michael Myers) is a big green ogre with the temperament that goes along with the job description.  He's always been left alone because everyone is scared of him, and that's just fine with him, as we see from the opening scenes of exposition.  The film really picks up, however, when he gets unwillingly hooked up with an overbearing little donkey (voice of Eddie Murphy) who latches onto the large smelly title character like a leech, forcing Shrek to deal with someone other than himself, if only minimally. <br /> <br />Through a series of fairy tale turns, Shrek finds himself on a quest to release a beautiful princess from a dragon, where she (voice of Cameron Diaz) has been trapped by a horrifying dragon.  It's not giving much away to say that the story otherwise seldom resembles the tales inferred by those Rapunzel/Snow White/Sleeping Beauty trappings, but there is a familiar yet uniquely handled moral to this story that warms one's heart in spite of itself. <br /> <br />\\"Shrek\\" walks the tightrope very nicely between being a grown-up take on fairy tales and still providing a solidly positive message.  I'd watch it again sometime....just not with a 6-year-old.
B00023B1LM|5.0|First off-- this is a great movie, even though it differs from the novel in many ways.  How could it not though?  Not to spoil too much-- but since the Jason Bourne of the novel was an un-official Vietnam Vet and things like cellphones and the internet werent around-- the plot needed a little reworking.  Though I will admit that a showdown with Carlos would have been nice.. <br /> <br />As for someone's misguided review about \\"comedy\\"-- The character didnt jump out of the window to be funny.  It was a way to imply the extent of the \\"behavioral software\\" that had been programmed into the assassins.  Since his arm and leg were broken, and he had no weopons he refused to allow himself to be interogatted--by jumping out the window, he takes away information, and draws the attention of the police making Jason flee in hopes that the job can be finished by someon else. <br /> <br />--while not exactly the course I might have chosen...its not odd storytelling, bad comedy, or a misplaced concience... <br /> <br />Anyway-- It is a fun movie to watch, it tries to be smart, but doesnt beat you over the head with it, and the action that takes place is mostly economical, without too much gratuitous gunplay or explosions. <br /> <br />Hope they make a third movie... and perhaps even more-- I was sad when I read the final novel-- maybe the movies will last longer?
6300214370|4.0|...you can have a copy of this film that defined a generation.  Well, okay, maybe not quite DEFINED, but Kevin Bacon's \\"Footloose\\" was and is a pop culture milestone of sorts, and even launched a wave of similar films of varying merit.  \\"Footloose\\" is earnest, yet fun. <br /> <br />The story involves a big city kid who has to move to a smallish town in Oklahoma/Texas/wherever, a town that's so far removed from his big city ways that it views him with suspicion.  Yep, things used to be that way, and still are in some places.  Bacon plays the new kid quite well for someone well out of his teens (ain't that show biz), and the character is drawn as one who's not a bad guy but just misunderstood.  Kinda James Dean Lite. <br /> <br />The plot tension involves rock'n'roll and dancing.  Both are very much frowned upon in this town on the buckle of the Bible Belt.  These days many may wonder why that was the case, and indeed it was back in the early 1980s and previous.  Parents feared several things about dancing to rock'n'roll, such as the fact that drinking and dope often accompanies such events (see RAVE) and the suspicion that healthy young people will often be sexually excited by seeing each other shake their booties, leading to unplanned babies and all of the attendant problems thereto. <br /> <br />Understandable parental concerns, of course.  But Ren, the new kid, eventually wins over the town because he's a good guy and he turns the kids his way, causing a somewhat good-natured rebellion that still has its tense moments.  John Lithgow is excellent here as the old-fashioned preacher with a personal ax to grind regarding this subject, and after the necessary confrontations have moved the story along, we have a nice happy ending with a Hollywood musical feel to it. <br /> <br />OK, so the film is far better than my description of it.  And it certainly is dated in some ways, but that's part of why this film is noteworthy.  In the early '80s it was just becoming acceptable for a movie to present youth culture as a stylish snapshot of itself.  Prior to this, such films were mostly renegade productions or judgemental/cautionary tales of said youth culture.  \\"Footloose\\" was in the first wave of films that celebrated the culture of youth in a positive way, and while the clothes, hairstyles, and music now look and sound like relics from a Museum Of Past Coolness, it deserves a place in history for that. <br /> <br />It was also one of the first films to produce a soundtrack album designed as a marketing tie-in, with multiple hit songs by various popular artists created especially for the project, including Kenny Loggins's title track, Deneice Williams's \\"Let's Hear it For the Boy,\\" Bonnie Tyler's \\"Holding Out For a Hero,\\" and \\"Almost Paradise,\\" a vapid rock ballad sung by the lead vocalists from Heart and Loverboy, as well as a few other cuts that had already been popular. <br /> <br />Beyond that, it's a feel-good film that pulls all the typical Hollywood Movie Strings and pushes all your buttons like a good manipulative Major Motion Picture should.  It works.  Naw, it's no major work of art, but a pop culture phenomenon that won't be forgotten anytime soon.
0780622553|3.0|There are already several hundred reviews posted - so I won't waste your time going over the plot. If you like film noir, \\"art house\\" films, moody, evocative, bone chilling, science fiction ala' Fritz Lang \\"Metropolis\\", \\"Blade Runner\\" or \\"The Crow\\", then you will enjoy this film. It is a good film, but has many flaws. Rufus Sewell is a highly gifted actor, classically trained British stage star - he does a credible American accent, and gives a strong performance, but the thinly written dialogue doesn't really give him much to work with. In other films, I've seen Rufus Sewell perform, he usually turns out flawless, heartfelt performances. Sewell does the very best he can with a part that does not really give him much dialogue, which is to his credit as an actor....most of his scenes are \\"emotion\\" reaction shots - without much dialogue. Although the last scene where he experiences an epiphany at Shell Beach is heartrendering and he \\"delivers the goods\\". This is not a character driven film, nor is it a plot driven film, there isn't much narrative development since it is primarily driven by special effects, visuals, cinematography - and in that element, it is an outstanding artistic accomplishment. Jennifer Connelly is under used, but there are a few scenes where she does a glorious, slinky, erotically charged \\"slow burn\\" as a nightclub torch singer that set the film on fire. I don't know if her musical scenes were lip-synched or not....but it was staged in a credible manner, whether or not she actually sang, she still was able to pull it off credibly. Problem is, she doesn't have much else to do in the rest of the film except look woe-ful, she is a foil to her husband and her part is thinly written as a long-suffering, devoted wife. Computer generated special effects overwhelm the viewer. The film is overwrought with excessive special effects, far too much emphasis on creepy monsters. However, it is spooky as all-get-out. William Hurt is masterful and gives a powerful performance. Kiefer Sutherland, an actor I genuinely respect, unfortunately is utterly miscast. Sutherland gives an overwrought, hammy, affected stilted performance. His line readings are choppy. It was painful to watch such a good actor give such a wretched performance. I wouldn't advise anyone under 15 see this film, it is quite violent but without much blood/gore mostly finger nail chomping really scary, there is no sex - except a pretty tame nude scene of ultra-sexy Rufus Sewell at the beginning of the film, but that is in very good taste - not a \\"full frontal\\" nude, just a tasteful shot from his side - and the obligatory \\"butt shot\\". I give this film a<br /><br />B minus - a flawed film, but still there are many fine moments. Visually stunning with phenomenal set design, cinematography, a technical achievement - but thinly written dialogue doesn't give talented cast much to do.performance.

B0002IU988|5.0|I give this record a 9.5/10. <br /> <br />I actually couldnt believe that there could be something even better than Creed itself in music.  I am a Myles Kennedy convert. <br /> <br />The CD is definately the best I've heard in the last year or so.  Their music is so confident and creative.  Scott Phillips and Mark Tremonti are two amazing musicians.  No song can make you feel better than listening to title track \\"One Day Remains.\\" <br /> <br />One interesting point i noticed: listen to all of Tremonti's guitar solos and pay close attention to the final two bars of the lead riff.  The melody changes heavily.  Its something ive never heard before and you have to hear it to understand.  One excellent example is on \\"Open your eyes.\\"  Another can be seen in \\"Down to my Last.\\" <br /> <br />I also appreciate that they kept parts of Creed alive.  Such as the interesting intro melodies by Tremonti.  Nothing sounds more like creed than the intro to \\"In Loving Memory.\\" <br /> <br />Thanks for reading my review, hope it helps you in deciding whether to buy the CD; I do suggest it.
B0001ZXM54|5.0|I own both this 2 cd collection and the \\"Chrome, Smoke & BBQ\\" 4 cd box.  If you are a casual ZZ Top fan or want to add a ZZ Top album to your collection, this 2 cd set is the way to go.  The sound is suberb and track selection excellent. \\"Rancho Texicano\\" flat out smokes any previous ZZ Top \\"greatest/best of\\" package of 2 cds or less.  Plus, I praise  the \\"Gods\\" of boogie for not including ZZ Top's worst song ever, \\"Heaven, Hell Or Houston\\", here. If you are more than a casual ZZ Top fan,  bordering on or crossing into die-hard territory (like me) skip this set and drop the extra cash on the box set.  The Moving Sidewalks tracks are a must. And, even though disc four of the box is a little weaker than the previous three, it is still essential ZZ Top.  Finally, if you have the extra cash around, buy both! <br />\\"Rancho Texicano\\" is much more user friendly for the car.
B0002OERI0|5.0|One of the few CDs that can be listened to the entire way through and feel content with all of the songs.  It's not necessarily a long opera like some reviews have stated... but definitely there is a theme to it.  I've listened to Green Day from their first successful CD Dookie until now... and it just shows how much they've matured as musicians, as much as how their audience have grown up with them along the way.  This is a MUST BUY for any punk, rock, long trip driving, someone wanting a voice in the world, etc etc... heck buy a few for your family this X-mas!!!
1591840562|5.0|To say that I really enjoyed reading his book is an understatement. Guy's personality emerges in between the lines as a people person, highly energized, positive and radiating with warmth, all of which I had an opportunity to confirm when we met at the beginning of his lecture held on September 30 at the Global Entrepreneurship Center, Florida International University. <br /> <br />Guy's writing style is a fresh breeze in the sea of books about the subject of entrepreneurship. To begin with, he brings a new meaning to the phrase: reading a book \\"cover to cover\\". The inner -side of the dust jacket feature all the entries to a competition Guy created for the design of his book cover, the art of marketing by itself! <br /> <br />The book is organized into eleven chapters which are grouped in a logical sequence of events: Causation, Articulation, Activation, Proliferation and Obligations. However, Kawasaki goes beyond the trivial route of conventional entrepreneurial wisdom; He discusses the importance of being a \\"Mench\\", Yiddish for a trusted man, in the overall entrepreneurial equation.  <br /> <br />Of special interest to me were three components that were interwoven into the text throughout the book: every chapter begins with the GIST, some kind of a birds view of the subject in the chapter, and ends up with both, a list of FAQ and a short exercise that enables the reader to get instant feedback on the message was understood. It also contains a well documented list of references some of which are already included in my library. Kawasaki ends up the book with a comprehensive and easy to follow index.   <br /> <br />Kawasaki's suggestions are simple to follow; for example, he suggests you send yourself an e-mail and review how it comes across. Another suggestion is the 10-20-30 rules, which refers to presentations before venture capitalists: 10 Power Point slides, 20 minutes and 30 font size. Kawasaki also provides a \\"virtual visit\\" into the VC's world  by providing key clues from his own experience on an array of subjects ranging from how to make a presentation powerful and convincing and how to interpretate the VC's response, to a list of questions and answers that any entrepreneur should keep in mind when dealing with VC firms. <br /> <br />I found it interesting that although the overall focus is on Kawasaki's experience with the high tech industry, many of his ideas and solutions can be easily implemented in other industries, such as the not for profit, for example.  <br /> <br />After I read the book I felt I would welcome a sequel; something along the lines of the \\"Art of the Finish Line\\", or even a more focused book on the  subject of the character traits that are likely to be found in a successful entrepreneur beyond the monetary reward and what it takes to develop them. <br /> <br />If my recommendation was for people to read the book, having met the author, I would strongly encourage organizations to invite him as a guest speaker. He is a talented speaker who knows how to instill passion and excitement in his audiences throughout his presentation by taking them on the entrepreneurial rollercoaster through the eyes of his many years of hard work and experience.  <br /> <br />Doron Zilbershtein <br />
B000268QB2|5.0|I had the opportunity a couple of weeks ago to see the band Keane in concert, and actually got autographs and pictures with the band members afterwards.  But enough about the concert, I want to talk about the music.  Keane's debut album, \\"Hopes and Fears,\\" is one of the most prolific albums of the year.  It is unfortunate, however, that pop fluff like Britney and Hilary dominates the radio, when true talent such as Keane is overlooked. <br /> <br />But I really want to talk about the music.  This whole album signifies the losses that can occur in any type of relationship, whether it be for the good or the bad.  Yes, the album does showcase some uplifting tunes, but for the most part, the album leaves you in a state of longing to start back at the beginning. <br /> <br />Of course, the first single, \\"Somewhere Only We Know,\\" reminds me a lot of the material Wings put out in the 70s (and of course, Tom Chaplin's voice is very reminiscent of Paul McCartney's).  But as the album progresses, you soon come to realize the hurt that can be possible from any type of relationship.  Listen to the seventh track, \\"She Has No Time,\\" and you will be swept away into a drowning sea of loneliness from a woman who no longer has the time to commit to love. <br /> <br />\\"Everybody's Changing\\" is another one of my favorite tracks.  It showcases the mighty talented Tim Rice-Oxley on piano as the track leads you through a person watching as others change while they're staying put.  Richard Hughes is a master at bringing in the right drums for each track, especially on the drum driven \\"Untitled 1.\\" <br /> <br />I recommend this album to anyone who appreciates artists who still write their own music and can perform without the need of a guitarist.  When listening to this album, I was extremely impressed with each track not having a guitar lead, and it keeps me captivated each time I listen to the album. <br /> <br />I only hope this album will be acknowledged by the Grammys in 2005.  I already know Keane is a huge success internationally; Keane can be a huge success in the U.S. as well.  Check this album out, and I'm sure you'll be very pleased!
0060090383|5.0|This book and all of Marian Keyes books are wonderful light reading, I see myself or those I know in her characters, her Irish sense of humour and down to earth style make her books a wonderful read. Can't wait for the next!
0743424425|5.0|The book was about a man and his family that moved from the northeast part of the country to a small town in Colorado. The man and his family needed money, so Jack the father interviewed at a hotel to watch it for the long winter. Jack and his family were doing fine for a while but Jack started to go crazy being trapped in there for so long. He started drinking again and hurting his family. His son Danny was always saying redrum over and over again. One day he lost it and went after his son and wife. They bothed escaped and Jack died from freezing to death outside when he didnt find them. I would recommend it to anybody that likes thrilling books.
0385659806|4.0|This is a very unusual novel mostly because of the narrator's autism. Simple to read, the novel has an interesting rhythm to it as the reader becomes more familiar with Christopher's disability. While I initially thought it would become repetitive, the story takes some turns to make it a consistently enjoyable reading experience.<br />Christopher begins to write the book to solve the mystery of the murder of Wellington, a neighbor's dog, like his hero Sherlock Holmes. Along the way, we learn about his family situation, his view of the world, his idiosyncrasies, and his school life. He's not exactly an unreliable narrator, but the author does an excellent job of imagining the problems involved when the storyteller has autism and the story is consistent with this perspective.<br />While not a perfect book, I would recommend this highly, especially to people who want a fresh and different reading experience. It's not at all preachy, and it deals with a little understood disability with honesty; this reader came away from the book with a new understanding of the difficulties of dealing with autism. It is well worth your time to pick this one up

B00003CXCT|4.0|I won't go on a long rant about how what i like or dislike the \\"special edition of the first film.  How can you have Greedo shoot first ?  My only dissapointment is that the edition did not include either 2 sided discs ( one for each cut original and special) or some way to have the old ones.  I am lucky that I do have them on laserdisc so I can keep my originals for the moivies.  The BONUS DISC is great lots of trailers and a pretty good documentary.  worth the price overall
0060925000|5.0|The book was un-put-down-able if ever there was such an adjective.It took me totally to a different world where I felt like I was Lata and going through all of her emotions.

B00007L4MJ|5.0|This is a silent film, with music and blurbs of dialoge interspersed throughout the movie.  It is the most perfect movie I have ever seen.  I just bought the remastered authorized dvd and watched it, I was mesmerizeded.  The acting, done by actors who are probably long dead by now are perfection incarnate.  So much to say with their faces and gestures who needs words.  It is so sad that today's movies with all the computer generated explosions, designer clothes, over-rated, overpaid \\"actors\\" who are only famous because their parents were big stars and have little to no \\"talent\\" (and aren't even good looking), even with all the technology available in Hollywood they could not produce a film as perfect as Metropolis. I'm so glad I bought this dvd.
0780622553|5.0|A film drenched in atmosphere, a unique story, wonderful villains, great sets and solid acting: a superb film.<br /><br />Imagine waking up in a bathrub not knowing who you are, why there's a dead woman in the adjacent room, or why mysterious people are chasing you.  Such is the dilemma faced by the protagonist in the opening of Dark City.  However, this plot thread is only the beginning of Dark City.  Aliens with the power to control everything and everyone, a mysterious scientist who talks in gasps, a solemn detective who begins to realize he doesn't know what's going on, a seemingly-schizophreniac detective who knows exactly what's going on, a beautiful woman caught in the middle of everything, the never-ending darkness, and the realization that perhaps what seems real is anything but.<br /><br />A beautiful film, brought down only by a rediculously out-of-place action sequence.  8.5/10
0743455967|5.0|Many authors, when asked about their career, are haughty and condescending. They act like it's a gift that no one else could posess, and we the readers are the stupid, pitiful little beings that couldn't possibly begin to comprehend their books, much less write one. Not so with King. No, he doesn't promise a free ride to becoming an author. His book, he will gladly tell you, is not your one-stop solution to all your writing problems. But it IS a start, and an encouraging one at that. The first half of this book is almost totally about his career as a writer, and no less fascinating than any of his other stories, even though this one is nonfiction. He is straightforward and honest, and gives the reader a closer connection to him. The second part of On Writing deals with the title-it's literally \\"on writing\\". Don't be looking for a dry textbook explanation, though. Still incorporating his own experiances and delightful tidbits about the process he has gone through in writing some of his books, such as Carrie, The Stand, and his wonderful Dark Tower series, King goes over all the factors that make up a good story, and what to avoid. I read this book in two days, and in saying that, I'm not saying \\"easy read\\", but \\"wonderful read\\". King had me constantly enthralled, constantly attentive to what he was saying. This is a useful and instructive book, but more than that, this is an inspiring book. It is hopeful and welcoming to new readers, and full of a passion for writing itself. Stephen King doesn't once promise an easy road full of fame and riches to a beginning writer...but he promises it'll be a heck of a trip, and there isn't a thing in the world that could ever compare. Cheers to Stephen King, and a resounding, simple \\"Thanks\\" for all you have written, and all you have shared...and most of all, for how much passion and inspiration you bring into your books and give to your readers. This relatively new Constant Reader has loved the trip so far, and is looking forwardto more of it.
B00006LLNU|4.0|People take Sigur Ros very seriously, maybe beacause of the whole \\"these songs don't really have names\\" thing and the \\"we made up our own language thing\\" but they don't seem to lofty or serious when you really think about it.  This music is somewhat predictable even though it is often beautiful.  The tempos are lumbering and the instrumentation is thick and somewhat unconventional.  It is moody, or just very emotional, but not a terribly eventful or arresting listen.  This band doesn't really need to give the songs names because they can barely be called songs; the two halves of the album kind of run together a little. <br /> <br />The only thing to say here is this stuff isn't complicated, just elegantly presented and very nice to listen to as you are doing something else or if you are just in a very chilled mood.  Basically either you like it or you don't, so just listen to the samples and you will probably have the idea.
B00005JMJG|4.0|This movie is definitely something new; it was produced by Focus Features, which tends to focus on films that are very anti-Hollywood in the sense that they are definitely not for everyone.  This film, along with Lost in Translation (another Focus movie), appeal to certain people, while others may not understand the content or simply find it boring.  This film also requires the viewer to think, which is a trait that many big studio films severely lack lately.<br /><br />The story centers around Joel Barish (Jim Carrey), a quiet introvert who, while constantly making negative observations toward the world, never does anything to better his situation in life.  That is until one day, for no reason at all, he skips out on work and goes to the beach, despite the fact that it's February.  While there, he meets Clementine (Kate Winslet), who is Joel's polar opposite.  She's a free spirit with a bit of a drinking problem, and she and Joel fall in love.  After a messy relationship, Clem decides to have her memories of Joel erased.  Joel finds about this, and, out of a combination of depression and suppressed rage, he decides to have her erased from his memories.  He goes to this clinic run by a Dr. Howard Mierzwiak (Tom Wilkinson) and his unprofessional staff.  While his staffers Stan (Mark Ruffalo), Patrick (Elijah Wood), and Mary (Kirsten Dunst) get drunk, stoned, and naked while working on Joel, he subconsciously decides that he no longer wants to erase her after he is forced to remember all the good memories he made with Clementine.  He then proceeds to \\"hide\\" his mental Clem in other memories where she doesn't belong, which creates some pretty funny results.<br /><br />For such a difficult concept, writer Charlie Kauffman did a very good job keeping things from getting too confusing.  Not only that, but he was also able to create a great twist to the whole thing.<br /><br />As I said earlier, this movie is not for everyone.  I did like it, but it was bizzare and a little trippy in some places.  This will make a very good rental, especially if you are unsure as to whether or not you will like it.e places.  This will make a very good rental, especially if you are unsure as to whether or not you will like it.
B000002H97|5.0|There is no better hard rock band than Metallica. That issue isn't even up for question. They are amazing musicians who have stood the test of time and will never back down. Getting that out of the way, THE BLACK ALBUM as it is fondly called is specatacular. Although it has a few more slower tracks than fans are used to, it still has the in your face thrash metal that Metallica fans love.       Everybody knows who Kirk Hammet is, and if you don't, you don't know rock music. He is one of the greatest guitarists ever and is a brilliant musician. His bandmate James Hetfield is also amzing. Besides being a great guitar player, he is and excellent frontman. He has a low growling voice that can have it's softer moments too. Lars Ulrich, the drummer and the founder of the band is also a revolutionary rock musician. His drum solos are that of legend. And to think, he was almost going to be a pro-tennis player instead of a drummer for the best band ever.      Introductions done with, let's get to the CD. It starts out with the ever popular ENTER SANDMAN. This is one of Metallica's most famouse songs thanks to the ever present MTV. Besides it's overplay, it is a fantastic song. Next is SAD BUT TRUE, a track that really shows Lars' true abilities. There is nothing &amp;quot;sad&amp;quot; about this song. HOLIER THAN THOUGH comes next with a true Metallica spirit behind it along with good lyrics(like in every song). My favorite track comes next, THE UNFORGIVEN. It is the first of the slow ballads, but it still has it's kick-ass moment, such as Kirk's amazing solo. Following THE UNFORGIVEN, are three hard-hitting metal songs that all have self-explanatory titles. WHEREVER I MAY ROAM, DONT TREAD ON ME, and THROUGH THE NEVER. Another slow song comes next, that is and instant classic. NOTHING ELSE MATTERS. With great lyrics, guitar parts, and vocals, this song has nowhere better to go. All the other songs are great, but you've probably stopped reading this by now, and I'm tired oftyping.       All in all, this is a great CD that I recomend for every rock fan out there, no matter what genre you like, you'll like this.
B00008H2LE|4.0|These guys are my second fav band! I love their music! If you like to here rock music and Chester screaming, buy this cd! I think you'll enjoy it! I know I did. My fav song from this cd is Breaking the Habit. Listen to it! It's really good. The cd actually belongs to my brother.
B0000029GA|5.0|Nas has gotten scattered since Illmatic, but Illmatic is a tight little album.  It is one of the most succinct and well balanced portraits of 90s New York hip hop, as opposed to the worthy but less focused works of Mobb Deep, BIG, etc.  I am not trying to insult those other artists, but say that this album's importance lies in its ability to say its piece (over excellent but basic production and with just the right amount of guest artists) and shut up.  Nas is young here but he sounds world weary, if almost poetic in his almost nihlistic view of life and where it is going.  He is a rapper with a lot to say and a determination to say it; among mainstream veterans he is way up there, maybe a little less of a sellout than Jay Z, maybe not. <br /> <br />But Illmatic is neither spectacular, incredibly unique, nor earth shattering.  There is nothing said here that isn't said elsewhere, so placing this album at the top of \\"best rap albums of all time\\" lists can be excessive.  This work is near the top of a bloated and overrated genre that steals attention from people who preach something besides bleak materialism and capitulation to the hood machinery that keeps eating all america's black people, even though Nas has moved from here since it was released.
0440241413|5.0|I am a \\"shopaholic\\" and at first, Becky reminded me of myself when I was first given the opportunity to have a credit card...and it spiraled from there! This book is so cute and fun and the fact that I related to it so well, made it even more fun to read. I have the next two Shopaholics and can't wait to get started!  <br />I'd definitely recommend this book.
B000000OQF|5.0|&amp;quot;Appetite for Destruction&amp;quot; is a CD in a league of it's own. It surpasses &amp;quot;Led Zeppelin IV&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Back in Black&amp;quot; by far. It is the best CD's ever by one of the best bands ever. Guns N' Roses came into the spectrum at the height of hair metal band faz. Such as Def Leppard, Poison, and Motley Crue were all the rage. Not that these bands don't rock, it's just that GN'R does so much better at it than them. This CD is the third best selling rock CD in the nation (behind the 2 earlier mentioned), and it is hard to see why it isn't numero uno. It definitely is in my book.      First off, there is Saul Hudson (Slash) on lead guitar. The best guitarist of all time. He has his own distinct style and has the speed to keep up with Eddie Van Halen and Toni Iommi. Although he has had his problems with drugs (he was clinically dead for over 30 seconds), what Rock-star hasn't. Next there is the amazing frontman Axl Rose (Bill Baily). That is simply all you have to say about Axl. Amazing. Although he doesn't have the best voice in the buisness, he makes up for it in stage presence and attitude. He has to be one of the best frontmen of all time. While the other members of the band aren't as prominent as Axl and Slash, they still deserve to be mentioned. Izzy Stradlin (Jeffrey Isabel) on rythym guitar. Steven Adler on Drums. And Michael &amp;quot;Duff&amp;quot; Mckaegen.      These songs were instant classics. Who can resist that opening to &amp;quot;Welcome to the Jungle.&amp;quot; Or the emotion behind &amp;quot;Sweet Child of Mine,&amp;quot; (plus the best guitar solos ever). This debut CD for the band was all about their lives, the good and the bad. Such tracks as &amp;quot;Mr. Brownstone,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;Paradise City,&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Rocket Queen,&amp;quot; have obvious drug and partying references behind them, and rock just much as they should.      This is the CD that spawned millions of fan-clubs and websites allabout the band. It is one of the essential rock CD's to have and of course I recomend it.
B0002KVUKM|4.0|One of the things that I thought was amazing about the early reviews were they seemed to miss the fact that this is was a PARODY, a take off of cheesy monster movies from the 50's. Like Frankenstein vs the Wolfman, or Zombies Ate My Neighbors.  <br /> <br />The movie is about Van Helsing. A man who is being employed by a secret service like organization to hunt down supernatural menaces. In his first encounter he is hunting down the evil Mr Hyde, and to try to get Dr Jeckyl back alive. The order is a mixture of priests and monks of seemingly every faith on the planet, all banding together to save humanity from dark forces.  <br /> <br />He is paired with an inventor and a monk named Carl(David Wenham, Faramir in LOTR). Though he can swear and womanize since, he is not a monk yet. They are sent on a mission to Eastern Europe, which not only suffers from Werewolves but Vampires. He brings a host of odd high tech weapons to fight the supernatural with. They are in the steam punk genre; automatic crossbows, crank powered saws, etc....  <br /> <br />It turns out that there is more than they expected. Count Vladislaus Dracula is working on animating his children, thousands and thousands of them, who lie dormant. He uses lightening, but for some reason the energy given to them is never quite right, and they die soon after. There is also some tie between him and Dracula, one that goes far back that he doesn't remember.  <br /> <br />This movie was so ridiculous it bordered on genius. The plot makes little sense, the acting is over the top and at times purposefully bad, and the plot devices are shamelessly obvious. In other words, it is the movie you watch with beer and lots of junk food.  <br /> <br />Hopefully there will be a sequel
B00005JNEI|5.0|The movie is wonderfull and show us that Bush is a liar and that he is using his power for his own interests. <br />Please, american people, vote for John Kerry and not for Bush!
B000002LFZ|3.0|Fleetwood Mac \\"Greatest Hits\\" is a collection of 16 songs from the group's peak period.    I would define the \\"peak period\\" as the five studio albums that the band did once Lindsey Buckingham and Stevie Nicks were brought into the band.    The addition of Buckingham and Nicks completed the forming of what was the core lineup for the band.(Lindsey Buckingham, Stevie Nicks, Christine McVie, John McVie, and Mick Fleetwood)  and completed Fleetwood Mac's transformation from a blues/rock band to a pop band.  The five albums: \\"Fleetwood Mac\\" (1975), \\"Rumours\\" (1977), \\"Tusk\\" (1979), \\"Mirage\\" (1982), and \\"Tango in the Night\\" (1987).    In a lot of ways, this was a culmination of the work done by these four members.  Following the release of \\"Tango in the Night\\", Lindsey Buckingham - who was a major creative force in Fleetwood Mac would depart the band.   Fleetwood Mac decided to replace Buckingham with 2 new members - vocalist Billy Burnette and guitarist Rick Vito.   So while this may be a culmination of what the core members would do, it also would be an introduction to the next era of Fleetwood Mac as the new lineup contributes two songs.   In addition to these two songs, there are 14 songs from the 5 albums made by the core members. <br /> <br />At the time \\"Greatest Hits\\" was released, Fleetwood Mac had a lot of momentum going.   Following the release of 1982's \\"Mirage\\" (which still failed to recapture a lot of the magic that 1977's \\"Rumours\\" had), Fleetwood Mac went on hiatus for 5 years until \\"Tango in the Night\\" was released.  Once \\"Tango\\" was released, the band had a lot of momentum going - easily the most since \\"Rumours\\".   Despite Buckingham's departure, the band continued the momentum from \\"Tango\\" as they went on a World Tour.  Thus it seemed the perfect time for a greatest hits collection to be released - and the perfect stage to introduce the new members. <br /> <br />As mentioned above, \\"Greatest Hits\\" includes 14 old songs and 2 new songs.   The collection does a decent job at distributing the songs: \\"Fleetwood Mac\\" has three songs (\\"Rhiannon\\", \\"Say You Love Me\\",\\"Over My Head\\"); \\"Rumours\\" is represented by the 4 big hits (\\"Don't Stop\\", \\"Go Your Own Way\\", \\"You Make Loving Fun\\", \\"Dreams\\"); Tusk has 2 songs (\\"Tusk\\" and an extended version of \\"Sara\\");  \\"Mirage\\" has two songs (\\"Hold Me\\" and \\"Gypsy\\"); and \\"Tango in the Night\\" has three songs (\\"Everywhere\\", \\"Little Lies\\", \\"Big Love\\").   The one thing to note is that at the time -this was a pretty good way to get all of Fleetwood Mac's \\"hits\\" on one CD.  Like many greatest hit collections, they don't often stand the test of time.  This collection is dated.   All of the songs on this collection (including the 2 'new' tracks) are represented on a newer 2 CD collection called \\"The Very Best of Fleetwood Mac\\" (the only exception is that \\"Big Love\\" is done live).   In addition, 13 of the 14 old songs found on this album are represented in the original or alternate versions on the \\"The Chain\\" boxed set. <br /> <br />The new songs aren't bad - they aren't the best songs I've heard Fleetwood Mac do, but they still aren't bad.   One thing that disappoints me is that Fleetwood Mac got very conservative with having two songs sung by Christine McVie (\\"As Long as You Follow\\") and Stevie Nicks (\\"No Questions Asked\\").   It would have been nice to introduce Billy Burnette's vocals to the fan base  I heard Burnette sing on the \\"Tango\\" Tour and while he isn't Lindsey Buckingham, he still has a lot to offer.   \\"As Long as You Follow\\" is a very average soft song - it fit perfectly in 80s radio.   New Mac member Rick Vito does a nice job on guitar.  I wouldn't buy this CD just to get this song.   I think the better of the two songs is \\"No Questions Asked\\".   Billy Burnette's background vocals are more prominent in this song. This song is a much more uptempo song - also very much cut in the mold for 80s radio.   I was surprised that this song didn't get a lot of airplay in the U.S.  <br /> <br />Asfor the 14 old songs, one thing that I am not happy with is the ordering.   I find that the best \\"Greatest Hits\\" collections are ones that arrange the songs in chronological order.  This allows me to see how the band progresses over time.   \\"Greatest Hits\\" shuffles the order up quite a bit.  There doesn't even seem to be any logic to how the songs were arranged.   \\"Big Love\\" and \\"Over My Head\\" are the last two old songs before the finale - \\"No Questions Asked\\".   This isn't the way to wrap up a greatest hits collection.     <br /> <br />Of course you can make the argument that there are better Fleetwood Mac songs that weren't necessarily \\"hits\\" that are excluded from this collection.   Most notably missing are tunes such as \\"Gold Dust Woman\\", \\"Seven Wonders\\", \\"Landslide\\", and \\"Love in Store\\" (all four are included on \\"The Very Best of Fleetwood Mac set\\").  Then again - you still get 16 songs and back in 1988 that was a good number of songs to get on any single disc collection. <br /> <br />The liner notes do not include any lyrics for these songs - even the new songs do not have the lyrics included.   I'm also disappointed that they don't list what album each of the songs is from.  There are also no songwriting credits, but the production credits are listed.   There is a nice from Stephen Davis that looks at the band on the eve of a concert from the \\"Tango\\" tour - but also provides some insight into each of the band members.  While this collection has good music, but it still is pretty dated and you are better off with \\"The Very Best of Fleetwood Mac\\".  However, you still may want to get this if you can get this CD at a good price.
B0000DD7LB|4.0|Okay...yes,Britney's voice is limited to a very certain extent. What she is making is \\"party\\" music should I say. She doesn't blow like Alicia Keys,but she's staying within the boundaries of her voice. Me,personally I thought the album was great. She's no worse than some of the other so called female singers out there now(ex:Ciara,Ashanti,Janet,etc.). These women are also limited in voice,BUT they make good \\"ENTERTAINERS\\".<br /><br />Yeah,she's half naked,but if you were to turn to BET you'd see more half naked women than a Girls Gone Wild movie. She's no worse than what's already out there. There were about 2 or 3 songs that I didn't like,other than that,I think it's a great album. As for her personal life.....that's her d@$n business. I don't really care to hear for it. So far I give all her albums 4 stars.
B0000009RT|5.0|I was in the Seminary in Richmond,Va. I was 15 and the priest who taught Latin and Spanish was a crazy man very impressed with this album. My formative mind was deftly and definitely warped by this album...I was never the same. I believe I can sing most of the songs from this album although it's been 25 years since I've heard any of it.  I can't describe this album musically or historically. I can say that it is funny and extremely well done and the quality is something that was so visual...well since it was my first album, I sort of expected all music to be this way or at least all rock and roll. It took a while to figure out that it was the genius of Frank that made this album so special. <br />I think there is more than sarcasm in his critic of the musical and social times, you can find out what that other is for yourself if you can...By the way, Frank, I told everyone I ran into that Mr. GreenJeans was your dad, even though I didn't believe it. Love, WPB.
B0000524CY|5.0|I have seen this movie the first time it came out at the theatres.  I stood in line outside in the freezing cold for one hour wondering what all the hype was about.  My brother and three other friends finally get into the theatre.  The movie starts.  The first squence is in Iraq and I'm still thinking so what.  Then we are transported to Georgetown.  Ellen Burstyn hears a noise in the attic and now I'm thinking the movie is getting interesting.  The first time William Friedkin shows us the one second clip of the demon I knew this was no ordinary movie.  When I left the theatre on that cold winter night I was not the same for a very long time.  When I went to bed I would check under the bed and sleep with the blanket over my head.  This movie effected me like no other movie has to this day.  William Friedkin is a genius.  This movie should have won more Oscars then it did (2 awards for sound and screenplay) but at that time the institution didn't give major awards to horror.  It does now ie. Silence of the Lambs, another great movie.  I can't believe I bought this dvd after 30 yrs.  I have watched this movie a dozen times and always find something new that I overlooked.  One of my favourite squence is the one in Iraq, if you get a chance listen to the director's comments on the people he encounters in this country.  Another scene that I overlooked was when Burstyn walks home alone and we get to hear that unforgettable music with the nuns' garments flowing in the wind.  That is film making at it's best.  The movies doesn't scare me as before but I still get a kick from it and yes I still jump when I hear that phone ring (watch the movie and you'll see what I mean).
B00030590I|4.0|*Hero* beautifully-filmed movie turned out to be one of the finer cinematic experiences I've subjected myself to in the last year. This is a state-sanctioned tale manages to more-or-less successfully fuse mythic history with post-modern storytelling in a manner that is occasionally jarring, but generally effective.<br /><br />The plot itself is archetypal in its streamlined straightforwardness: a tyrant warlord has long feared three assassins, but one nameless hero from a little-known province has bested them one after another. By way of rewarding the industrious official and satisfying his own curiosity, the emperor invites the champion to court to tell his tale. The champion's stories comprise the bulk of the movie -- leaving the court visit to serve primarily as a loose frame for the majority of the narrative.<br /><br />And here's where it gets tricky.<br /><br />The hero episodically relates the circumstances of his three victories; and then the emperor -- having listened politely throughout the exposition -- decides that the hero is lying, and that he must be in cahoots with the assassins. Then the warlord proceeds to offer his own speculative version of the three victories. And THEN the hero counters the charge ... offering yet a THIRD version of the three victories which may or may not be the \\"real\\" way things went down. When I accused Hero of being a bit post-modern in its storytelling, this is what I meant: the device of the unreliable narrator is exploited to the fullest.<br /><br />The third and final description of events comes across as the one most likely to be true. For one thing, the hero's final words on the subject are never challenged by the warlord king ... and for another, all the symbolism points our subconscious Magic Eight Balls towards \\"Yes.\\" The actors are finally wearing white, implying that this version is the pure one; and there is a brief out-of-frame tie-in with the court events as we understand them.<br /><br />All in all, I give the movie an A+ for style and a B for story. It wasn't perfect, and I have no doubt that the cultural disconnect between me and China stands in the way of potential deeper appreciation on my part, and that's fine. I got what I wanted from this movie, and I am comfortable recommending it to others.ry.

B000000OQ5|5.0|Yes, I was a hair metal 13-yr-old headbanger when this baby came out.  But only this album makes me proud of that fact.  While my friends were busy watching Ricky Rachman (or however you spell that idiot's name) helplessly hoping to regain their souls, I was busy losing my hearing on the only album that really mattered.  If I have any Ratt or Cinderella or Dokken left in my collection, it's only there for comfort and reminiscence.  This CD on the other hand finds it's way into a player at least once every couple of months.  Like anything of quality, it's stood the test of time.  It sounds as relevant today as it did back then.  Maybe even more so, considering their lack of popularity when this was first released. <br /> <br />The Great Radio Controversy may have brought Tesla the limelight.  It may even have more depth and breadth than this.  But nothing has the prowess, consistency, and, well, the guts that this album displays.  Great, down to earth lyrics, blistering guitar work X2, awesome use of modern musical technology, and an uncanny confidence and muscle about it that only Mick Jagger or Jimmy Page should be able to flex.  How can this possibly be the sound of a band's first album? It's simply insane. <br /> <br />For those of you who only know the \\"Love Song\\" or \\"Signs\\" Tesla, slap some Depends on before you listen to this album. If memory serves, this release hangs in history somewhere between '1984' and 'Appetite for Destruction'.  It's the perfect spot for it.  If any comparison's can be attached to Mechanical Resonance, it would be a mix between those two albums. But take that and make it harder, slicker and somehow more raw.  This is an essential album for any rocker.  It's joining me on my way to work tomorrow, and the way home I'm sure.  That's its only flaw: if I pop it in my CD player, I may not listen to anything else for a week or more.  But the absence of diversity is more than worth it. <br />
0201485672|5.0|Great book with very clear writing style, no fluff. Excellent structure and examples. This is classic.
B00005221M|4.0|I love movies with  beautiful scenery and this movie is one of my favourites.  Add a good story, good acting and a great soundtrack and you got my kind of movie.  All I ask of a movie is to give me that escape to the place and time that I'm not familiar with and this one does the job.  Wes Studi who plays Magua is a pleasure to watch.  He should have if not won best supporting actor for that year.  I would like to give this movie a four and half star rating but wasn't able to on the review page.  Thank God Hollywood still makes movies like this and not the crap that we sometimes waste our time watching.
B0002VKZL6|5.0|When I read the first review here, the one that says this album is MK's most rocking effort since Dire Straits, I was quite put off, since I am a fan of his quiet work. Nevertheless I bought the album. I'm a fan of most of his work, so I thought \\"hey, it can't be THAT bad!\\". I got the MK bug when I first heard \\"Brothers In Arms\\" years and years ago. That song got me hooked on Dire Straits, and I started listening to his solo releases as well. From \\"Ragpicker's Dream,\\" through \\"Sailing To Philadelphia,\\" to this last album, I find myself enjoying nine out of ten songs of his. It seems to me that some people expect all MK's solo albums to have a sound akin to that of Dire Straits. I think it's great that an artist evolves and writes songs that he enjoys singing, which it is clear to me that Knopfler does on \\"Shangri-La.\\" This he also did on \\"Sailing To Philadelphia,\\" the title song of which, in my opinion, is one of the best songs ever, with regard to both melody and lyrics. The first time I listened through the new album and heard \\"5:15am,\\" \\"The Trawlerman's song,\\" \\"Boom, like that,\\" and \\"Our Shangri-La,\\" I immediately recognised the distinctive Knopfler-esque story-telling way of writing and singing. While I do miss some of the fantastic guitar solos of his earlier albums, the interesting lyrics, instantly familiar way of singing and the sweet, mellow quality of the songs more than make up for it. Any Knopfler fan that doesn't wear \\"Dire Straits-goggles,\\" and that liked \\"Sailing To Philadelphia\\" should thoroughly enjoy the quiet, smooth musical trip to a relaxing, faraway corner of the soul that is \\"Shangri-La.\\"
B0002VKZL6|3.0|There is an elegance and strong sense of place in most of these songs and this is what Mr. Knopfler has been shooting for, it seems, since that latter days of Dire Straits.  The stark, minimal arrangements and occasional interjection of that patented guitar sound elevate some of the songs, but it more than occasionally is turgid and unrelentingly pedestrian in execution.<br /><br />I don't agree that it qualifies necessarily as music for the sophisticated listener.  This is a cop out and too high brow for me.  It takes work to generate some passion into a song and this is what Mr. Knopfler seems to be missing, at least in the musical arrangement of the song.  Not only is he adamant about NOT supplying any fiery licks into his songs anymore, but, I think, several of the songs would actually tell a better story if more up-tempo and richer.
B000002UAU|5.0|Amazon considers this to be one of its essential recordings for music fans because it IS fantastic! This album is a must for Beatles' fans as well as fans of 60's rock.<br /><br />To begin with, the CD cover draws you in--what an awesome collection of faces and characters! Colorful and regal, The Beatles stand out in front of the crowd and you just know the music on the album will be superior--and it is! As people have noted time and again, this album has several classic songs that should be ranked among the best rock songs ever. The CD starts out strong with \\"Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band\\" and goes straight into the emotional \\"With a Little Help From My Friends.\\" Then there's infamous \\"Lucy In The Sky With Diamonds,\\" about tripping on drugs--an experience many people can relate to as well. \\"When I'm Sixty-Four\\" is probably my personal favorite on the CD; but it was a tough choice between that song and \\"With A Little Help From My Friends.\\"<br /><br />The song \\"She's Leaving Home\\" is very beautiful and it has great insight into teen angst still common today. Truly, all the songs on the CD are great, including \\"Getting Better\\" and \\"Lovely Rita.\\"<br /><br />The CD ends with first the reprise of \\"Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band\\" and then the incredibly strong hit \\"A Day In The Life.\\" If you're not familiar with this music and you like classic rock then the CD is a must if only for the last song.<br /><br />The CD comes with extensive liner notes--a huge plus! You get all the lyrics to the songs as well as photos of the band. There is a complete listing of who's who on the CD cover, and dates and recording locations of the songs. The notes include mention of the \\"15 kilocycle tone, put there--especially to annoy your dog,\\" and the concluding \\"few seconds of...Beatle chatter.\\" Listen for it!<br /><br />All in all, the set of songs on this CD reflects incredible talent, thought and hard work by The Beatles.

0140177396|4.0|The novel \\" Of Mice And Men \\", written by John Steinbeck, is about two young men, their character traits could not be more different, who work as farmhands in California for earning enough money to realize their common dream of an own farm.  George is a small and intelligent guy, instead of Lennie, who is very strong but stupid and mentaly retarded.  George feels responsible for Lennie and cares for him, because of a promise he gave Lennie&#180;s aunt. That&#180;s not an easy thing for George, because Lennie in his childish behaviour sometimes gets in rage and then he is unpredictable.  But although George could live a better and easier life whithout Lennie, he stands by his side and protects him.But on the farms they get in trouble from time to time, so they never stay very long on one place.In the end Lennie&#180;s uncontrollability even jeopardize their dream.But I don&#180;t want to tell too much, read it yourself !  I liked the novel very much, because it shows that even two very different people can be close to each other, for example connected through a common dream.  The end of John Steinbeck&#180;s story was very sad and unexpected and I would like to read a continuation, because I want to know how it will go on and if George will realize his dream...It was a very interesting book!
B00009V7P8|5.0|I stumbled across Damien Rice accidentally....I had to fulfill a membership obligation with a popular mail order CD club, and decided that the ablum looked, well, interesting. Really that's the best I was hoping for.  <br /> <br />Well....I must have done something great in a past life...being gifted with Damien Rice's talent, genius and insight is as good an argument for the presence of something Divine that I've heard in a long time.
B0002O06N0|5.0|If you've never heard of The Black Keys, and you like rock n roll, count you're lucky stars: you've now discovered the best band of the current millenium. Please disregard any comparison to any other band (especially if they have \\"White\\" or \\"Stripes\\" in the name -- The Keys are different in that they have a great drummer, they are not pretty-boy pansies, they rock, and they have testosterone, as other reviews have said.) <br /> <br />These guys simply rock, with that touch of blues and Hendrix other bands aspire to, but the are so much more genuine. Their debut, The Big Comeup, was great; Thickfreakness (Time Magazine's #3 album of 2003, not bad for a band no one has heard of) was a phenomonal follow up; now Rubber Factory is THE best rock album of 2004. A natural evolution from their prior offerrings, Rubber Factory is a bit more polished, and an amazingly solid album all the way through, yet still raw and primal. Call them blues, call them rock, call them retro, call them whatever you want. Whatever you call them, call them damned good.
B00005JMXX|5.0|When I saw the previews for this film, it became, for me, the most eagerly anticipated movie release of the summer.  I couldn't wait to see it.  The storyline seemed intriguing, the special effects looked spectacular, and just thinking about the film gave me goosebumps.<br /><br />And when it was all said and done, the first thought that entered my mind upon exiting the theater was, \\"I cannot WAIT to get my hands on the DVD!\\"<br /><br />For some reason, people have been giving this movie a hard time.  The acting wasn't up to par, the special effects were blah, and all the film accomplished was to churn out \\"environmentalist BS\\" propaganda.<br /><br />Oookaaayyy.  I'm not sure which movie you were watching.<br /><br />I loved this movie.  Loved it, loved it, loved it.  And, like I said earlier, I have been waiting for the DVD release for months.<br /><br />When I pluck down my hard-earned cash to take in a feature, I really don't give a darn about deep, moving storylines; nor do the special effects rate high on my scale; and don't even get me started on that so-called \\"environmentalist BS\\" mumbo-jumbo hogwash.  Whatever.<br /><br />I go to movies to be entertained, plain and simple.  And \\"The Day After Tomorrow\\" was, for me, one exhilarating roller-coaster of a ride.<br /><br />Lookings for thrills and chills?  You CANNOT go wrong with this movie.  But if you're afraid of being taken over by all that \\"environmentalist BS\\" this movie is supposedly spewing, perhaps you'd be better off taking in another Care Bears feature.<br /><br />I love those darling huggables.  And no one has ever accused them of global warming.
B00000J9HE|5.0|To say in one word...PERFECTION!!! <br /> <br />Karajan has a grasp of structure and tone few others ever come close to in this music. <br /> <br />I also love Davis with Boston for different reasons.. <br /> <br />Finland is a cold frozen arctic country and this music reflects it...there is one whole piece Tapiola which evokes this country wonderfully....  <br /> <br />You have to go to Finland to understand this vision of music, but if you can't get there Karajan has an understanding of the desolate north... <br /> <br />I live in Canada so comply that this interpretation has that feeling of the North!!! <br /> <br />For serious collectors indeed!!!
0060005424|5.0|I know I am in the minority, but I thought this one was better than Sabriel. I immediately fell in love with the Disreputable Dog and Mogget is in top form with his sarcastic grumpy self. Also, I thought that Lireal was a better developed character. We get to see her grow from an insecure little girl to a woman with fierce determination and courage.<br /><br />I will dispense with the customary summary of the book since that has been done repeatedly already. I will only add a warning: If you start this book, make sure you have the next one handy because it doesn't end neatly. In fact, the ending was more or a less a cliff hanger.
B0001Z52RU|2.0|great acting,great plot,wonderful special effects. but highly disturbing content and an even more disturbing directors cut ending on the dvd. not for the weak of heart.seeing it once was enough for me. i found it to be a very raw and harsh film.
B00000CQJZ|1.0|AVOID  AVOID  AVOID AVOID  AVOID  AVOID AVOID  AVOID  AVOID  <br /> <br />I watched about half an hour of this nasty transfer last night, it was awful: sound quality is atrocious, the print is lousy.  Which I supposed lives up to its billing, \\"...the best print we could find.\\"   <br /> <br />AVOID  AVOID  AVOID AVOID  AVOID  AVOID AVOID  AVOID  AVOID  <br /> <br />Of course the Criterion Collection version has to be great -- avoid the LaserLight!  The only reason I can think of to buy this turkey is the TRULY WEIRD intro by that renowned Hitchcock expert Tony Curtis.  Even that is just sad.
0792839749|5.0|Heralded as a family favorite upon its release, \\"Chitty Chitty Bang Bang\\" delivers the appropriate subliminal musical tone that draws and cements the images of Icarus into the minds of children. This film could very well prevent Guajardian visions in the budding minds of children, who will no doubt grow up with shocking and pessimistic myths and legends in various comparative literature classes. <br /> <br />This film takes the myth of the flight of Icarus, but demolishes the bummer quotient. Dick Van Dyke, in control of the industrial age wings-of-wax, instead rides toward the sun without fear of CCBB's tires melting; and even if they do, the joke is on the sun, because you don't need wheels to fly! And when the family floating in the car sings about how much they love their artisan miracle, the flawed Icarus tale finally has the merry ending that the masses have, for centuries, cried out for!
B0001I561E|5.0|just want to say this is a great dvd!!!! and my fav disney movie of all time..
B0000024W3|4.0|This is the \\"oops\\" Dylan album, but, that being said, it's still a very good album. This strange mix of blues, folk-rock, and, yes, even some pop, will confuse even the normal Dylan fan's palate. It contains a very strange live version of \\"Like a Rolling Stone,\\" which isn't so great, and there are a few other weak songs, but the good songs greatly outweigh the bad. Alberta #1, Alberta #2, Early Mornin' Rain, She Belongs to Me (Live version) are arguably the best, but the cover of Simon and Garfunkle's \\"The Boxer\\" isn't exactly bad, and \\"The Mighty Quinn (Quinn the Eskimo)\\" is a fun song. <br /> <br />\\"Self Portrait\\" isn't nearly his best ablum, but its certainly worth a listen. And besides, 22 songs for $11, not a bad deal. Buy it, you'll be pleasantly surprised.
B000006Y6X|5.0|I bought this CD having read 'A Music Fans' review not expecting to find any additional tracks and when I found the first five singles (A & B sides) I was delighted.  As far as I can tell some of these tracks are not available anywhere else on CD.  Tracks like The Horse, Dance Stance (the original version of Burn It Down) and Soul Finger really added to the whole concept of this album.  Kevin Rowland has never sounded angrier.
0385512104|4.0|This was a good book. I don't think I'm willing to go \\"great\\" on this one, but good. It was fast-paced, interesting, and engaging, although I have to agree with whoever here said that it lacked \\"wow\\" factor. Perhaps that was the point - these are days in the life of a very real, if not a very typical, boy, and there's a certain charm in that.  <br /> <br />I don't think that this is a book that you \\"get\\" or \\"don't get\\", as has been suggested. Quite the contrary, I think this book opens the door for us to think about the main character in a new, more human way - not as an \\"autistic\\" who we should hold at a distance and feel sorry for, but as a real person whom we can feel all the usual emotions - frustration and annoyance included - for. These are, after all, the emotions we feel free to use with so-called \\"normal\\" acquaintances, and in this book we come to see the main character as a real person with real (different, but real) views.
B0000013G9|5.0|The only word that could describe this album is, \\"masterpiece.\\" TLC's return from their original colorful, baggy, and prepubescent style, showed the world what beautiful, strong, sassy women they always were, just a little more obvious. 16 tracks with no fillers and all quality gives this album the feel of '90s Soul & R&B. Respected producers, Dallas Austin (\\"Creep,\\" and \\"Case of the Fake People\\"), Jermaine Dupri (\\"Kick Your Game\\"), Organized Noize (\\"Waterfalls\\"), and Babyface (\\"Red Light Special,\\" \\"Diggin' On You,\\" and \\"Let's Do It Again\\"), lend their hand at making this one of TLC's most memorable albums to date. As a bonus, TLC's remake of \\"If I Was Your Girlfriend\\" tramples Prince's 1985 original. And the album also features guest appearances from Puff Daddy, Busta Rhymes, Phife (of A Tribe Called Quest), as well as OutKast's Dre (Andre 3000) on the conclusion track,  \\"Sumthin' Wicked This Way Comes,\\" which is my personal favorite. We can call this, without any doubt, the greatest album of the decade.
B00024BHTC|2.0|I usually don't write reviews; I'm more of a review reader. But this CD has really bugged the hell outta me. If you've listened to the previous albums of Nightwish (Wishmaster, Century Child, Oceanborn, etc.), their newest one sounds like CRAP. Their strong powerful guitars in many of their songs back then have now been diminished or drowned out by annoying synth effects. Also, the male vocals in this new album are REALLY REALLY ANNOYING. He sounds like a weasel that's just been skewered. If you go listen to \\"Century Child\\", the male vocals sound in there sound so much nicer and enjoyable. Another thing, WHY THE HECK did they add these Rammstien-esk beats in the second track? It does not sound nice at all; it takes the whole purpose of symphonic metal and chucks it a crowd of posers who give five stars to this piece of crap and call it a \\"masterpiece\\". So don't go buy this album; go buy some Lacuna Coil, Edenbridge, previous Nightwish albums, or if you can't help it, some mainstream Evanescence. The only reason I give this album two stars is because the female vocal still retained her unique sound.
B00005JMJG|1.0|I had high hopes for ESSM but it was really a letdown.  The movie starts out with some promise but once it gets into the memory erase part it gets really long and convoluted.  There are some disturbing images that reminded me of \\"The Wall\\" and the main character's attempts to keep his psycho girlfriend from fading from his memory seem mind-numbingly endless.  This movie shares the same fault as \\"Being John Malkovich\\", it is a good concept that just gets beaten to death.  I think the idea of memory erasure has real promise as a cinematic plotline but it fails completely here.  While I could identify somewhat with Jim Carey's pathetic-yet-humorous downtrodden lead character, I found his girlfriend to be laboriously quirky.  During this movie, I found myself rooting for their partnership to dissolve while the plot is, of course, for their reunification.  On a lighter note, it was not as bad as \\"Lost in Translation\\".  Unless you want to waste several hours of your life wondering what ESSM is actually about, and waiting for it to get better, skip this one altogether.
B0002ZDVEU|5.0|This movie is much better than the first.  Matt Damon is just incredable.
B00005JMJ4|1.0|Lost in Translation is quite possibly the worst movie I have ever seen.  It is two hours or so (I must admit that I couldn't make it all the way through) of absolutely, positively nothing happening.  My wife did manage to sit through Lost in Translation just to see if it would pick up and it doesn't at all.  There is no character development, no drama, no suspense, and no anything that would make anyone watch this movie other than Murray on the cover of the box.  It should be criminal to bilk unsuspecting movie watchers out of their time and money like this.  If you decide that you have two hours of your life that you will never want back to waste on this movie, don't say I didn't warn you.
B00004UBBG|5.0|\\"The Hoople\\" was unabashed, throw the kitchen sink in for good measure excess.  It was, however, majestic excess.  Ian Hunter turned this into an all out production experience, and indulged himself to the fullest.  Fortunately for Mott fans, Ian's indulgence was magnificent in scope...and it worked! \\"Marionette\\"'s instrumental breaks can still send a shiver up my spine; \\"The Golden Age of Rock'n'Roll\\" is both great and sad, while \\"Roll Away the Stone\\" is the perfect, pre-added track send off from Mott the Hoople's great, final gasp.
B00000K3G8|5.0|Great music, great scenes, great dancing! What more could one ask for? Nothing I tell you! <br /> <br />Great for putting on in the background while hanging with friends, although sometimes it can distract and derail the conversation!
B00009W0U4|5.0|First of all...don't ever let your kids watch this movie. And if they do, well...that's their problem.     Unlike Memento (which I totally loved), Irreversible doesn't have two stories going on and then meet around the middle of the movie. It looks like scenes were filmed in order, but put in an inverse way. That results with credits as the beginning :) Also, that provides you a feeling you don't meet that often in movies nowadays: you always see the consequences before their causes. So you always know later why that thing you just saw happened. Brilliant.    Concerning the raw side of the movie. Well since lots of reviewers almost told you all the story of Irreversible (you're wise guys (ironic)), you surely know about those long violent scenes. I won't tell everything like some others made. I'll just tell you that, when you usually see that something reaaaally sick and bad and violent is gonna happen in a movie, most of time you see like a scary face and a shadow on the wall, or just a short short clip of the act...and then the camera stops. Well here, no shadow, no clip. The camera doesn't stop when it usually does. That says all.    About the actors. I never really liked Monica Belucci. But, in Irreversible, she handles her character like no other ever could. I really think she rocks now. For Vincent Perez, same thing. I always liked him, but wow...on every point, on every aspect (and that's the same for his male peer in the movie..can't remember his name) he's (they're) perfect! Great actors who give an outstanding performance...and actually said \\"oui\\" to play in this...I'd say...experimental movie...which surprised me (but in the best possible way).    Frenchies aren't good for comic movies...but Irreversible shows they rock at movies that traumatize people. You gotta give to Ceasar what is Ceasar's.      P.S. If you think that getting the end of the movie first will give you the whole punch of that story, you're so totally wrong. There's even a bigger punch at the beginning of the movie (which you see last).
B0002Z0EYA|4.0|Ok, not an accurate portrayal of the Illiad, of course....but still fun to watch.  And I liked the nihilism, too.  Really, though, this is probably the best Trojan War adaptation I've seen.  Alot of people are saying that Helen of Troy is much better.  Well, I'd have to disagree...Helen of Troy looks exactly like what it was meant to be: a TV drama.    Anyway....Eric Bana is unbelievable in this.  Far better performance than Pitt's.  Unfortunately, I think that his presence in this movie was undermined due to the 'apparent' disappointment of the 'Hulk'.  But with Pitt....well....I like the guy....but I'm going to have to call \\"bad casting\\" on this one.  Here's why.  When I see Bad Pitt running around swinging a sword in a dress.....I don't see Achilles....I see Brad Pitt with a sword.  And whereas a Greek warrior would look kinda cool swinging a sword around, Brad Pitt just looks silly.  This is what happens when a celebrity gets shoved in our face too much....he becomes unbelievable in movie roles.  People like Brad Pitt and Tom Cruise will never fully 'transform' into their roles because we'll always see them as the celebrity.    By the way...Brian Cox looks just like the real Agememnon.  Don't believe me?  Try searching for an ancient Greek artifact engraved with Agememnon's face (it might have been a death mask).  It looks just like Brian Cox.  I can't help but think that when the casting directors were searching for possible actors, they took one look at a picture of this gold plate and said, \\"What the....this looks just like Brian Cox!\\"
B0001RVTXO|4.0|This is, of course, 23 of the best songs ever recorded.  But why would anyone want to buy it?  If you're a Pixies fan, then you should already own all these songs.  If you're just getting into them, buy Doolittle and pretty soon you'll want to own all the other albums anyway.
B00005JMXX|5.0|There's a bloated, drug addicted, ultra-conservative radio show host that never refers to environmentalists as enviromentalists.... he instead refers to them as 'enviromentalist wackos'.  You know, It amazes me how there are actually STILL people in this country that don't believe that there are any environmental risks at stake.  That everything is just perfectly fine and there's no pollution and the oil will flow for eternity.  The planet is ours, right?  Without us the planet wouldn't exist, RIGHT?  We can do whatever we want, RIGHT? <br /> <br />In this movie, The Day After Tomorrow, an ice age is triggered by global warming.  Although I don't think that global warming (by our hands) will ever cause such an event, I DO believe that ice ages occur extrememly quickly can desimate entire regions in a matter of a few days.  I believe it's happened in the distant paast and it will happen in the future.  But I think it's cyclical and is due to the planet's obliquity and it's relation to precession.  But in regards to the movie, I think the message is clear and thought-provoking.  Although there's not much between the scenes of destruction and the struggle to survive, I still think the message it sends alone deserves a excellent rating.
B00003CXCT|3.0|Picked up the box set last weekend. I was an avid Star Wars fan and I gotta say, my jaw hit the ground when I watched \\"Return of the Jedi.\\" When they changed the music scene in Jabba's Palace to this really bad, made for Saturday morning cartoony replacement scene. It was like it was an exercise on \\"how can we make cool CGIs???\\" When they put in Christian Hayden or whatever his name is, to replace the original actor in the \\"ghost scene\\" and when they changed the scenes at the end during the celebration. It was really obvious. Plus the music was horrible. <br /> <br />I will say however, that the movies do look better after been cleaned up. Some of the things were hokey though. When Greedo shot first-pause it right before and play it in VERY slow motion. You see Han's head flick to his right to avoid the shot-it almost looked like an amateur did some kind of horrible photoshop animation with a cut and paste of his head! <br /> <br />Luckily, I do have the VHS versions. If I ever want to watch the last 3 episodes again, I'd watch the first 2 on DVD and the last one on VHS. <br /> <br />The saving grace was Empire Strikes Back, which could pass off as a fairly modern made movie. Luckily, of the 3, that was my favorite one.
B00005JMUA|5.0|After seeing this in the theater, I left convinced that the Kill Bill saga (both 1 & 2 together) is Tarentino's best wotk.  Seeing Vol.2 on DVD just reinforced that opinion.  From the very opening with the haunting piano....it seemed like it was destined to more than the action-fest of the first installment.  We're treated to the full story of how the 'wedding massacre' went down proving that the event was far more brutal and traitorous than any of us could of imagined.   <br /> <br />The biggest questions of all left from vol.1 (why and why, to certain issues) are all wrapped up nicely here.  Bill, is sadistic and insane, of course; but he might not be the cold-blooded psycho we expect him to be. <br /> <br />By the way....the shot of the Bride and Pai Mei doing the animal forms in synch with each other in front of the red backdrop has to be the single coolest thing I've ever seen in a movie.
B00005JMEW|3.0|Thats what this picture is, a modern female Rambo, who kills hundreds of guys only witn a knife. Why the didn't use a fire weapon?
B00005JMEW|5.0|1.  If you're a serious movie fan then you've probably spent some time hanging out with friends talking about waht you'd do if you made a movie.  Alot of people, myself included, talk about putting in icons from movies that we saw when we were younger but don't get alot of work anymore.  You'd suspect that alot of filmmakers have converstions like this before they break into Hollywood....but for some reason they never follow up on those ideas.  They've apparently forgotten what it's like to be a movie geek.  Not Q.T.  In Pulp Fiction he got Travolta.  In Jackie Brown it was Pam Grier.  And here in Kill Bill he got Carradine.  All 70s icons. You just know that Tarentino was sitting around at one point with some friends talking about how he'd get Carradine in his movie no matter how old he was.  Q.T. keeps it real. <br /> <br />2.  Game of Death costume.  Again, as with No.1 it's the ultimate geek fantasy to pay homage to some of your favorite films in your own film.  The biker suit that the Bride wears during the House of Blue Leaves fight is a replica of Bruce Lee's suit in the movie, Game of Death. <br /> <br />3.  Hatori Honzo.  Sonny Chiba played a character named Hatori Honzo in a Japanese TV series called Shadow Riders.  The thing with this show, however, is that each season contained the same characters but a completely different story that had no relation to the previous one.  Q.T. decided to carry on the legacy of Hatori Honzo in his own movie by getting none other than Sonny Chiba himself to play Honzo.  A true testament to Tarentino's dedication to classic filmmaking. <br /> <br />4.  Gordon Liu.  What can I say.  If you've ever seen Shaolin Master Killer....then you were no doubt freaking out at the presence of Gordon Liu in BOTH Kill Bill volumes. <br /> <br />5.  The Fights!  Yeah we all know how incredible and intense the House of Blue Leaves fight is.  My favorite shot being the silhouetted fighting in front of the blue backdrop similar to scenes in Samurai Fiction.  But how about the brutal and realistic fight between the Bride and Vernetta Green?  Since when have you seen two women fight in a movie and end up ACTUALLY SWEATING AND BLEEDING afterwards?  Awesome. <br /> <br />Of course, there are many more reasons to love this movie....these are simple reminders as to why everyone should own this film.
B00029LNHS|5.0|It has been far to long since I bought a cd that could entertain me on almost each song. \\"Where is the love\\" has been overplayed though the idea is rich in theory. A s for every other song...standing ovation. I am hooked to this CD. The beats make me want to dance, the lyrics have emotion and thought ... this is a cd to ease the pain of this emo filled world...
B00004XMS0|3.0|........I never really liked any of these movies.  Even the Tim Burton 'masterpieces'.  In my opinion, the franchise started off kinda weak, then got progressively worse.  Of course, the Burton films are like Citizen Cain compared to the Schumacher efforts.   <br /> <br />I give the first movie 3 stars for one scene and one scene only.  The scene wear Batman and Vicki Vale are driving back to the cave.  You can feel the uneasiness from Vicki as she nervously looks upon the stoic Batman.  Later, in the cave, Batman reveals the Joker's method for poisoning the masses.  This scene actually showed Batman as a detective which seemed to be lacking throughout most of the movie.  This is an aspect of his personality that both filmmakers unfortuantely neglected.  That's about it. The rest of the movie wasn't terrible but it just  didn't really do anything for me.  I can see, though, how so many people enjoy the Burton films.  Anyone who liked the Schumacher films, of course, should be downright ashamed of themselves. <br /> <br />With all that said.  I AM looking forward to this new Batman origin story, Batman Begins.  Why?  Well, Christopher Nolan is involved and if you've seen any of his three films you already know he's incapable of making a bad movie.  And by the look of the teaser trailer....this is going to have a very, very serious tone to it.
0553213105|3.0|I recently read Pride and Prejudice, by Jane Austen, for a project in my AP English Class. I enjoyed the novel, and thought it fairly funny. The novel begins with Mrs. Bennet, who is earnestly searching husbands for her two eldest daughters, Jane and Elizabeth. The arrival of Charles Bingley, a wealthy bachelor, is an exciting prospect. She thus proceeds to set her daughter Jane up with him, and in the course of events, her other daughter, Elizabeth, falls in love with Mr. Bingley's friend, Fitzwilliam Darcy. The novel seems to lack; however, a more serious plot. The main themes are love, public status, and class, all of which seem to me rather less important in the scheme of things. All throughout the novel, the reader's main motivation to finish the novel is the unveiling of the fate of Elizabeth and Darcy. While the characters are very interesting and well structured, I feel the novel lacks a serious plot line. I believe the novel to be more of a gossip based story rather than a classic. I would not recommend this novel to others.
0393035158|1.0|there is no purely rational justification for the precious value of human life.  in other words, it is impossible to justify moral agency using reason alone, we are reduced to scientific organisms.  sam harris needs a basic college education in philosophy.  then again, he is likely to make a killing on the sheer idiocy of this publicity stunt. cheers!
0393035158|5.0|In our current society it is the height of impropriety to question a person's beliefs which stem from their religious faith. Faith is the bedrock upon which religion is built. Yet The Oxford Dictionary defines faith as: \\"firm belief in something for which there is no proof.\\" For a belief to be rational, it must be supported by proof - or at least a reasoned argument. It follows that those religious laws which seek their justification in faith alone (rather than the law's impact) actually provide no rational basis for why such laws should be enforced.  <br /> <br />But consider, isn't it better to enact laws and form beliefs based upon external justification rather than blind faith? <br /> <br />A case in point: contrast the following religious laws: \\"Thou shall not kill\\" and \\"Don't eat pork.\\" One can find a number of external justifications for not killing people that are not based on faith. For instance: 1) a society in which killing is unchecked would be an impossible place to live, 2) it is ethically, morally, and pragmatically better to treat others they way you would like to be treated, 3) life is precious and should not be wasted, etc. No appeal to faith is necessary to justify \\"thou shall not kill.\\" <br /> <br />\\"Don't eat pork\\" is a little different. Perhaps justification can be found for the prohibition by showing the health hazards of eating pork, but the law is usually justified on the grounds of faith. A holy book has proscribed the conduct, so to engage in the behavior is breaking the rules. No external justification is needed since one accepts the wisdom of the holy book on faith.  <br /> <br />But unfortunately the problems of faith aren't restricted to who eats a ham sandwich and who sticks with the tuna salad. Those who act only on faith without regard to the consequences of their actions are responsible for the crusades, the pogroms, and 9/11. They burn books without reading them and gang rape woman in northern Pakistan. All with the same unquestioned and reliance on faith.  <br /> <br />One reviewer, below, writes \\"Belief in God, not just religion, can make this world a better place.\\" The problem is that Al Qaeda operatives also believe in God... they just think He wants them to fight a holy war rather than to \\"turn the other cheek.\\" Like Christians and their Bible, Al Qaeda can point to passages in the Quraan which support their beliefs. Since God usually doesn't come down to give press conferences to clarify what He actually said, there is no way to convince someone that their faith is wrong and yours is right.  <br /> <br />Faith may be appropriate when it comes to your own relationship with the world, but when you use it as a justification to regulate others, faith is subject to too much abuse. <br />The only effective way to make laws, run governments, or protect societies is to build on a foundation of rational justification.  <br /> <br />This book is an important step in creating a dialogue in this largely-ignored, yet hugely critical force behind today's global politics. <br />
B00024BHTC|5.0|Nightwish for this CD got there hand on a realy live orchestra. Why people don't get that this what they are using is beyoned me. This orchestra was used by  Howard Shore while recording the music for the \\"Lord Of The Rings\\" -trilogy...!!! <br /> <br />That's right people it's the same orchestra who here playing all the music for the \\"Lord Of The Rings\\" movies. Must band metal or non-metal would love to get there hands on that kind of orchestra. <br /> <br />Know a long with that the Guiters have taken front and center more then on there last CD's. On top of that Marco Hietala shows why he is so good at not only bass buy singing. Yes people the same Marco Hietala that is the lead singer for Tarot. In fact on the song Romanticide it sounds like they went and got the band Tarot for that song. It is very more heavy then any other Nightwish song.  <br /> <br />Tarja is even better. Emppu is great. Jukka is just as good as he has always been. And Tuomas is still one of the best song witers.  <br />Give Nightwish the best orchestra around and you get a great CD.
0441009425|4.0|This is a very engrossing novel that is full of interesting, if at times implausible, plot twists.  The witty dialogue is also fun.  Near the end, however, things become progressively more implausible and that mars an otherwise great read.  Alastair Reynolds also has the annoying habit of having characters divulge information to other characters without explaining it to the reader.  A typical example might be something like:  Then XX recounted what she had learned in the Shroud, and YY understood why ZZ had to be stopped at all costs.  At this point, Reynolds then moves onto another character/plot line without recounting XX's narrative.  This happens 3-4 times in the book.  Annoying.  Oh well, nothing's perfect.  Bottom line:  I read it, couldn't put it down, and plan to read the next one!
B00005JNEI|1.0|Once again, Michael Moore has used his video editing skills in an  attempt get his anti-American sentiment to the public.  As a proud Veteran, I am insulted by this \\"documentary\\" and would hope any true American would see through his lies and propganda.
B00005JNEI|5.0|Usually I go to see movies for their entertainment value, and occasionally I will also see something that's genuinely inspiring or even moving, but often just to be able to laugh, admire great art and acting and a good engaging story are enough for me. <br /> <br />This movie is something completely different, as it's not trying just to entertain (though it does) or just be artful (though it is), but to tell the truth to the American people that they have been blinded from by the people in power who work solely for their own greed and ulterior motives, without any consideration to the American public they're supposed to serve, or to the world at large.  We're at one of the biggest crossroads not just in American politics, but in human history, and Moore presents that argument very clearly and understandably about how we've been duped and what we must do come November 2nd.  The stakes are higher than they've ever been, and Mr. Moore shows us that abudnantly.   <br /> <br />Why the most important movie ever made?  Simply because if this movie helps accomplish it's goal of getting Bush ousted from the White House, it will be a victory not just for America, but for the whole world, and Mr. Moore is to be applauded for his willingness to speak out and for his great courage under fire.  I don't think it would even be out of the question for him to win a Nobel Peace Prize for the brave work he's doing to help turn our country and planet around.  People around the world detest what this President is doing, and they pray like many of us Americans that we will see the light and vote appropriately before it's too late and we get four more years of this madman running the country.  Worst case scenario, that Bush again gets to set about destroying the world for four more years, at least Mr. Moore will have opened the eyes of millions and millions of people worldwide, and the seeds of peace and truth will have been planted to come to fruition at a slightly later time.  In addition to wholeheartedly recommending this movie, I also highly suggest paying regular visits to michaelmoore.com (especially the MUST READ section) to get more truth coming out every day that the media, influenced too much by the right wing agenda likes to keep hidden.  Bravo Mr. Moore - you have our full support, appreciation and love for all you've done and continue to do.
B00005JNEI|5.0|Sadly, even in light of how the Iraq situation seems to get worse and worse each day, there are still many people who say, \\"Oh, I won't see that Michael Moore film... I hear it's really biased.\\"  I wish these folks would smack themselves on the head and realize that administration officials have been feeding everyone THEIR side of the story for three-plus years, so what's WRONG with hearing an opposing view for a lousy TWO HOURS?  I'm not saying you need to agree with every single point Mr. Moore makes here, but what's so crazy about viewing the darned thing once before giving it a blanket dismissal?<br /><br />Just be warned, viewers may find precious little to refute in \\"Fahrenheit 9/11\\", as Mr. Moore makes so many of his points by simply letting the president speak for himself, via the ample newsclips that were assembled for the film.  One of my favorites is the quote in the subject line, which Mr. Bush delivered to a roomful of fat-cat campaign contributors during a lavish fundraising dinner.  Actually, the entire quote is even more revealing: \\"Ah, the haves and have-mores... some people call you the elite... I call you my base.\\"  And not only does the quote confirm Mr. Moore's assertions about who the president is truly \\"for\\", but it also raises (yet again!) questions about the leader of the free world's mental agility, in that he actually allowed those comments to be videotaped!<br /><br />But, hey, if you still need another reason to watch this movie, it's also very, very funny in places.  And, of all forms of humor, political humor is always particularly fun, isn't it?  Also, the humor gives one occasional breaks from the serious, heart-rending, and tragic moments in the film, which I have to be honest and say are also here in abundance.<br /><br />That's it for now.  See the movie.  Vote.  Let's see what happens.
B0000047GA|2.0|I have *NOT* listened to this album in full. I am, however, completely turned off by the fidelity of all the samples I have just listened to. There's NO excuse for an album sounding that bad in '69. Ghad, there was Zeppelin, Hendrix, Clapton, Miles - who recorded this thing?<br /><br />All musicians on this CD are superlative examples of their mastery of their instruments, but the above reviewers in general are correct. Holdsworth MADE Lifetime along with Tony William's kick-ass drumming, and most probably insisted - perfectionist that he was, and still is - that it *sounded* like something other than a bootleg.<br /><br />Personally, I'd regard this as something a collector should have - it's for a devotee, not for someone trying to access the genre for the first time because the fidelity is just darn terrible - and one of the above reviewers is so correct. It's like Dylan looking for his \\"Girl From The North Country\\", or \\"Knocking on Heaven's Door\\". At least they let Tony Williams in so he wouldn't sing any more!<br /><br />All gags aside, a dissapointing effort. Overpriced, but one to have if you are a collector. You have to strain to hear the seed of what was to become Holdsworth's version of Lifetime, which I have not forgotten for 30 plus years. A quantum difference in fidelity, and quality of music. I'd rather buy Tony William's Lifetime Collection if I had to make the choice. I'd be tempted to pick this one up on peer to peer if I was desperate... Very UNimpressed.
0060090383|5.0|Serious and funny in equal measure, this book is a perfect read for every woman.  Rachel, as some other reviewers have complained, is indeed a very shallow person whose life is way off track, but this (in case the aforementioned reviewers have somehow missed it) is the story of her RECOVERY.  And what a story!   <br /> <br />Rachel, for those of you who haven't read the plot summaries, is a drug addict living crazy in the big city, and she's finally been convinced to go to rehab...but she's not convinced she's got a problem.  Instead, she sees rehab as a way to meet celebrities and figure out a way to get back her boyfriend, who dumped her when he couldn't handle her drug problem anymore.  She scoffs at the weaknesses of the other addicts, refusing to admit her own, and bitches constantly about her terrifying therapist, awful roommate, and total lack of celebrity sightings.   <br /> <br />While we're laughing (or shaking our heads) at how snippy and silly and immature Rachel can be, somehow Ms. Keyes gets us inside her head and we begin to understand her, just as Rachel begins to understand herself.  Then the healing begins, and boy is the journey painful.  With great sensitivity and without overanalyzing, Ms. Keyes gives us an unflinching look at addiction, adulthood, love, sex, confronting the self, and healing it.  A gifted writer by whom I have not read a bad book, Marian Keyes has outdone herself with RACHEL'S HOLIDAY. <br /> <br />One complaint (not M.K.'s fault): the cover.  Where do they keep coming up with these stupid covers full of people way too skinny to be serious, let alone real?  For all its humor, this is ultimately a serious story of personal redemption, and for that the cover is completely wrong.
B0002IQNAG|5.0|Ive been waiting for something like this forever.  Dawn of the Dead is one of the best movies ever made.  The extras with this box set are exhaustive.  First there are the three versions of the movie.  The theatrical unrated release, A longer Directors Cut release(Even though George prefers the Theatrical release), and a European version by Dario Argento(The only one in this set I had not previously watched).  And the fourth DVD has two documentary's on the movie, and a tour of the mall with Ken Foree.  Plus some guys home movies of the shooting.  Every DVD has commentary.  The Theatrical has George and Chris Romero along with Tom Savini.  The Uncut has Richard Rubinstein and Perry Martin.  And the European has all the actors doing the commentary (My favorite).  This is the only boxset of Dawn of the Dead you will ever have to buy.  It is complete!  Also comes with a cool comic book.
B00005JKGO|5.0|Although many argue about the meaning of his films, few will debate Fellini's impact on cinema and popular culture. I find it amusing how many people try to find a moral message in his films and characters. The brilliance of his films is that characters  are presented without sympathy or scorn. They simply exist like fleeting emotions. Sure, you'll love, envy and hate Marcello's character all at the same time. That's a lot like real life. Feminists always hate Fellini's portrayal of women as sex objects. Get a critical life! The same director who gave us La Dolce Vita and 8 1/2 turned around and made a brilliant film about a middle aged woman's point of view in \\"Juliette of the Spirits\\".<br /><br />Returning to la Dolce Vita, Fellini seems as obsessed as we are with the celebrity lifestyle and glitz of the famous. This film is oddly prescient in predicting that mania for the rich and famous. I'll go out on a limb here and say that fans of Reality TV Shows will find La Dolce Vita oddly familiar. Let's not forget the strange photographer who hangs around Marcello named \\"Paparazzo\\". This cinematic leech is precisely where the term \\"Paparazzi\\" comes from... Fellini foresaw that bizarre pop culture vulture would be increasingly a participant in celebrity lives (and deaths) as well as a chronicler.<br /><br />In spite of all this, Fellini's films are fun. He seems to have the unique ability to breezily make biting social commentary, while at the same time showing us all the decadent fun we want. Perhaps the final word is that Life is Sweet, no matter how screwed up it is. Like this film, the best thing is to just jump in and experience it.

B00005V9IL|4.0|The abyss is a very tense, mysterious can't wait to find out what this is-story, though I don't find the end as watertight as the rest of this movie lifts the level of the watchers' expectations to. I expected a lot more from the ending of this movie. Therefore, do not watch the extended version of the Abyss, unless you are a HUGE fan, it's toooo looooooong, and really boring.
B000002OG5|1.0|Before anyone sends me hate mail for giving this only one star, let me just say that I'd give five stars to the film score for THE GODFATHER (not to mention PARTS II and III) just as soon as I'd give five stars for STAR WARS or THE SOUND OF MUSIC. <br /> <br />The bad rating is not for the film score but for this CD, which (as of my typing this) is the only available soundtrack of THE GODFATHER.  I used to own this CD, but I sold it, because the sound is horrible and it only contains less than half of the music from the film.  One would think that in this age of digitally remastered soundtracks with expanded tracks, etc., there would be one for one of the greatest films of all time.  In fact, here is only a very small list of film soundtracks which have been remastered and re-released with the majority (if not all) of the music from their respective films: <br /> <br />STAR WARS / JAWS / THE SOUND OF MUSIC / 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY / RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK <br /> <br />My advice to the many people who love this film score so much (as I do) is simply to be patient and hope that there will soon be a quality soundtrack release, one which does not insult the ears or the intelligence of the listeners.
B0000524CY|4.0|For starters, the extended version of this film is no improvement on the original version of \\"The Exorcist\\" nor does it hurt it.  The additions are just redundant.  So much could have gone wrong (see subsequent sequels or rather, don't)and this film could have been exploitation crap.  Fortunately, under the able direction of William Friedkin from a script by the book's author William Peter Blatty it is not.  Forget the more sensational aspects of the film(the head-turning, the projectile vomiting, the over-the-top obsenity)where this film scares most is on a psycholological level.  The film takes pains to explain the psychological and theological aspects of satanic possession.  The mood of the film is enhanced by great cinematography, particularly it's chilly, damp Georgetown setting.  No film that I can recall has utilized sound to elicit chills like this one does.  There is a superb cast here led by Ellen Burstyn as the distraught mother, Chris MacNeil.  Central to the film is Jason Miller's performance as Father Damien Karras, a church psychologist who is experiencing doubt in his chosen calling.  It is this character that adds heft to most of the film.  Max Von Sydow is effectively authorative as Father Merrin, the priest who had encountered satanic possession before and was almost killed by the experience.  It's difficult to gauge the contribution of Linda Blair because of her age I believe doubles were utilized for the more intense sequences her character, Regan, was in.  For instance, actress Mercedes McCambridge contributed the voice of Regan in the latter stages of possession.
0140195076|5.0|This is one of the finest introductions to Vedic Astrology you'll find anywhere.  The information is as authentic as it gets, coming straight from the oral tradition of India where the authors studied for years.

B00000K19E|5.0|Judging from the volume of reviews for \\"The Matrix\\" at this web-site I surmise that there's not much new that can be really said about it, other than it's a great film and a landmark in sci-fi.  Recently I was watching the recent DVD issue of George Lucas' first feature film, THX-1138.  The basic plots of these films seem to mirror one another: futuristic society where the human populace is controlled by malevolent machines.  The difference between the two films is that \\"The Matrix\\" has a more fleshed out plot and better production values.  It's not the only comparison I can make between the Wachowskis film and a George Lucas film.  When \\"The Matrix\\" was released in the spring of 1999 it practically made irrelevant the upcoming release of Lucas' \\"Phantom Menace\\".
B000000HZT|5.0|Genesis keyboardist Tony Banks began his solo career with 1979's \\"A Curious Feeling.\\" This is an outstanding solo debut for Banks, and, of all his solo albums, \\"A Curious Feeling\\" is the most progressive-sounding, the one that sounds the most like vintage Genesis. Not only is Tony's songwriting and keyboard-playing here superb (as always), but he also proves himself on this album to be a fine guitarist and bass player. With some extra help from Genesis' touring drummer Chester Thompson and singer Kim Beacon, Tony delivers such stunning tracks as the instrumentals \\"From The Undertow,\\" \\"Forever Morning,\\" and the truly gorgeous \\"Waters Of Lethe,\\" as well as great melodic songs like \\"Lucky Me\\" (which *could* have been a hit single), and the title tune. There's also brilliant progressive tracks like the powerful \\"Somebody Else's Dream,\\" and, what is arguably the album's centerpiece, \\"You,\\" which starts off as a beautiful love song before seguing into a charging, classic Genesis-style instrumental break. Brilliant music, and brilliant performances all around by Banks, Thompson and singer Kim Beacon, whose powerful voice fits Tony's dramatic rock perfectly. \\"A Curious Feeling\\" is a terrific solo debut for Tony Banks.
0790729628|5.0|Not to dismiss the director's cut of \\"Blade Runner\\", but I have a soft spot for the version I saw in the theatre during the Summer of '82 with it's studio imposed narration and happy ending.  When I saw this film then I was just blown away.  Bear in mind, though, that it was released in the summer of \\"E.T.\\" when the audiences were more inclined toward feel-good alien movies and not somber futuristic sci-fi.  The reviews at the time said it was more style than substance, and the box office was lukewarm.  The fortunes of \\"Blade Runner\\" were revived with the emerging home video market(Another classic futuristic film was released that summer, \\"The Road Warrior\\").  Why is this film a classic in either version?  The sets and special effects in this film are just mind-blowing.  It imagines Los Angeles in the year 2020 where hi-tech mingles with decay, where the cultural influences are hybrid Anglo-Mexican-Japanese, and there has been an ecological change in weather patterns where sunny California now more closely resembles Seattle.  The plot involves a group of replicants(androids) with a built-in limited lifespan who escape slave labor in the off-world colonies who return to Earth to find their creator to increase their life expectancy.  Since replicants are outlawed on Earth it is the job of blade runners(bounty hunters) to exterminate them, Deckard (Harrison Ford) being most prominent among blade runners.  Ford gives an appropriately world weary performance as Deckard, something akin to a detective from a Chandler or Hammet novel.  Rutger Hauer as Roy Batty, the leader of the replicants, gives a multi-leveled performance where we are simultaneous sympathetic to his plight but repulsed by the apparent barbarity of his actions in carrying out his goal.  Sean Young is beautiful and mysterious as Rachel, like a femme fatale from a 40's noir film.  A young Darryl Hannah is also quite good as Pris, one of the replicants.  I'd also like to note the presence of Joe Turkel who plays Tyrell, head of the corporation who created the replicants.  Turkel was a veteran of Stanley Kubrick films, specifically \\"Paths of Glory\\" and \\"The Shining\\".  \\"Blade Runner\\" is a great film in either it's original version and the director's cut.  My only question is what is the meaning of the unicorn dream?

B00004STDN|5.0|Although this movie did not have as many inside jokes (\\"I had fifty bucks bet on those ***holes\\") and as much character development (\\"she's heard me tell her a million times 'I love you' but she's never heard me say 'I'm sorry.'  Would you tell her that for me Al?  Tell her John says he's sorry\\") as Die Hard, Lithgow is, dare I say it, as good as Rickman, and the action sequences are more varied, more plentiful and more realistic.  The endings to both satisfy and the overall coherence of the plot in both is excellent.  Buy both \\"Cliffhanger\\" and \\"Die Hard\\" for your action collections.
B00005JNEI|5.0|If you have not seen this movie because you may have different political views than Michael Moore, that is no excuse.  His movie takes what we are all too afraid to say, and slams it into our faces.  I believe that everyone should see this movie.  You may not agree with everything that is in it, but it will truly open some eyes.  There are things you think you know, but you do not know for sure until you have watched this powerful movie.  It will make you laugh, cry, and most of all, spit in anger.  I recommend this movie to everyone that thought something wasn't right with our government over the past 4 years, and to those of you who saw nothing wrong.
B00005JNEI|5.0|I hear too many people say that they do not want to see this film because they claim its unpatriotic.

Why can't they see that? <br /> <br />If this is you, then  yourself a favor. Think of all the people are making serious sacrifices in Iraq. Can't you spend 2 or 3 hours of your life to perhaps humor me? At least at that point you can honestly say to yourself that your open to discussion. <br /> <br />Now, with that said, I've been a Moore fan for many years, but i'm putting that aside when I say: THIS IS SIMPLY A FANTASTIC FILM - PERIOD.  In my view, this is not a political film. This is a presentation of facts that you will not see on T.V.  Mr. Moore has become a skillful artist and deserves credit as one of the best film-makers of our generation.    <br /> <br />Congratulations Mike, and THANKS!!!

B00005JNBQ|5.0|The summer movie season is gone and with it came the usual onslaught of action flicks, big-budget thrillers and even a few hilarious comedies. Matt Damon, Will Smith, Tom Cruise, Tobey Maguire and Will Ferrell all had big hits. However, in the midst of all the robots, amnesiac hit men, mustachioed newscasters and web slinging, a different kind of leading man set quite a unique landmark: Filmdom has a new reigning nerd, and his name is Napoleon Dynamite.<br /><br />Newcomer Jon Heder stars as the protagonist in the title role of director Jared Hess' debut film about a tall, moon boot-wearing geek with thick glasses and a curly red hairdo trying to make it through his high school days in rural Idaho. He lives with his older brother Kip (Aaron Ruell), an equally clueless loser who spends his days chatting with babes on the Internet, and their grandmother, a four-wheeler enthusiast played by Sandy Martin.<br /><br />After an accident in the sand dunes leaves granny with a broken coccyx, Napoleon and Kip's uncle Rico (Jon Gries) becomes their temporary caretaker. Uncle Rico assumes this responsibility the only way he knows how: by showing the boys boring videos of himself throwing footballs past the camera (his team almost won State in 1982) and recruiting Kip to help him sell plastic kitchenware and breast enlargement pills door-to-door.<br /><br />In between receiving nonstop ridicule and alienation from his classmates, Napoleon spends most of his spare time touting his nunchaku skills, drawing flatulent fantasy creatures, feeding his pet llama Tina scraps of ham, sloppily chugging cranberry juice, testing out a time machine Kip bought online (complete with power crystals) and learning \\"flippin' sweet moves\\" from an ancient hip-hop dance tape he finds at a thrift store.<br /><br />Rest assured, \\"Napoleon Dynamite\\" does have a plot, minimal as it may be. He befriends Mexican transfer student Pedro (Efren Ramirez) and manages his campaign to run for class president against the token popular girl Summer (played by Hillary Duff's sister, Haylie). There's even a love interest for Napoleon named Deb (Tina Majorino), a quirky girl who wears a ponytail on the side of her head and specializes in Glamour Shots photography and making cheap vinyl key chains.<br /><br />You'll be too busy, however, watching Heder steal every single scene he's in while at the same time, destroying all the clich&eacute;s of how characters like him are supposed to act. After all, any movie nerd can have a pocket protector and fawn over Gillian Anderson, but how many have ever stuffed tater tots in their pocket or tied fishing line to an action figure and dragged it from a moving school bus? Add to that Heder's throaty, deadpan delivery of lines like \\"Are you drinking 1 percent milk because you think you're fat?\\" and what you end up with is a new cinematic hero for the Star Trek-quoting, comic book-collecting masses.<br /><br />Hess' directorial style and dialogue have drawn comparisons to both Wes Anderson's \\"Rushmore\\" and Todd Solondz's \\"Welcome to the Dollhouse.\\" But his film has indie cred coming from almost every angle and just enough slapstick (including a hilarious cameo by Diedrich Bader as the instructor of his own brand of martial arts, Rex Kwon Do) to distance itself as an extremely original and entertaining movie.<br /><br />If you want to see this hidden gem of a movie (and I highly recommend you do) you'd better hurry because it's likely to be knocked out of theaters soon by the slew of upcoming blockbusters that, most likely, won't contain any tater tots or llamas.o run for class president against the token popular girl Summer (played by Hillary Duff's sister, Haylie).

B00005BCPC|4.0|This movie has mystery, intrigue, and sensuality. It is Austenesque in the way so many other so-called Jane Austen movies are - that is, somewhat true to the story but made with a movie maker's interpretive eye. I liked the spunky main character, I liked the rich lighting and use of color, and I found the pace of the story moved along very nicely. Some complain it isn't true to the book - so what? How many movies loosely based on classics really are? Further, who says they always should be? The only question that matters is: Were you entertained? I certainly was.
B000002UAX|5.0|By God this album came at me and left me speechless. This album shows the Beatles about to explode. John crafted his genious, and Paul crafted a bunch of fluffy pink pillow stuff alone. Which is just fine with me. I like John a lot more then Paul basicaly because John had imagination and struck me as suicidal.  <br />   The Beatles were a concept group in some departments. This was not one of them. It wasn't revolution (pardon the pun) but it cam very close.  <br />   The album didnt have to many trippy songs...it was more rock.  <br />  Johns songs as always were best. Revolution1 was in my opinion the best of the bunch. Glass onions was one hell of an inside joke about Paul being dead. Revolution9 was freaky, and Happiness was a nice suicide song. The rest were average and comparable to Paul songs. <br />  Pauls songs were okay. Helter Skelter was awesome, a Paul rarity. Why dont we do it in the road was another good paul.  Olbla di obla da is happy paul fluff, Everything else isnt worth mention. <br />  George was filler uppers but good ones.  <br />  The album needed a smash no 1 single (besides that acursed \\"While my Guitar Gently Weeps) which I think means Hey Jude(by,dare i say it,Paul) and Revolution and Hey Bulldog should have been included since they werent on another album and the album didnt have but one no 1 out of the many songs. The cover could have been more original(its blank for snots sake) <br />    <br />
0780625129|5.0|This was very good and I enjoyed it a lot. I have a deep respect and admiration for Edward Norton. I think he is a fantastic actor.  I like when directors disturb me.  Evoking any reaction is better than being bland, even if it does give me nightmares. :-p
B000002UAR|5.0|If you are searching for something not very trippy(Sgt Pepper) and not something pointless(Meet the Beatles...Help!...Please Please ME) but right in the middle then your search is finished..,a perfect combination of drugs depression and(dare I say it) sex...I think the Revovler is ooodles better then Sgt Pepper(supposadly there greatest).
B000006NPY|5.0|In June 1998, the Smashing Pumpkins released their incredible album, \\"Adore\\", which opened up a new pathway for their music.  This was exactly one month before they played a free concert for a lucky 125,000 fans in Minneapolis!<br /><br />Coming down off of the opus of their career, \\"Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness\\", the Smashing Pumpkins wanted to re-direct their musical energy.  Previously, they were knee-deep in the grunge hoopla, focusing on driving, gritty guitars and screaming vocals.  On \\"Adore\\", they evolved into a more melodic down tempo which was not as well-received as their former albums.  The guitar buzzing was still around on tracks like \\"Ava Adore\\", but much of the album had a very heavy piano thread and at times, an electronica background, to which fans were generally not as receptive.  If you have never heard this album or if you would just like to see if your opinions match the ones below, (on a scale of 1 to 10), then read on!<br /><br />\\"Adore\\" is one of those excellently gloomy records that you can listen to while watching the rain out your window, or while you're going through something rough in your life, or to just simply appreciate the beauty in the lyrics and musical accompaniment that Billy Corgan and co. expertly craft together, which ultimately feels like you are reading through a chest of letters that Corgan left behind for a former love.  Corgan has stated that he wanted this album to be an enigma, not a Pumpkins record, not an acoustic record and not an electronica record, something indescribable.  This is a concept to be appreciated and one that you can feel that in every track on this heart-breaking record.<br /><br />Track 1: To Sheila--(9)--Starting with the opening track, you know you are not listening to a typical Smashing Pumpkins record.  Corgan's voice is crisp, clear and melodic and doesn't have the normal razor-sharp edge to it.  You can understand the lyrics clearly and really feel within you the emotions being conveyed here.  The instrumental accompaniment is light and soft as well.<br /><br />Track 2: Ava Adore--(10)--one of the singles from this album, this is a strong track.  Here, the Pumpkins pick up the tempo a bit as Corgan wails about his obsession and desire for his love.  She is everything in his world, from the beauty to the murder, and he will do everything he can to keep them together and keep her perfect for him.<br /><br />Track 3: Perfect--(9)--the companion and follow-up to their classic \\"1979\\", Corgan is telling a former love that things can be perfect this time around if they can just give it another go.  This was released as a follow-up single, but did not do as well as \\"Ava Adore\\", which ultimately lead to the back-burner positioning of this album.<br /><br />Track 4: Daphne Descends--(8)--a good track with a great beat, Corgan is calling a girl out on her love for someone who will never return it.  She loves him for herself, he will never love her back, or at least, not in the same way that she loves him.<br /><br />Track 5: Once Upon a Time--(7)--a song from Corgan to his mother, he's trying to tell her that he's not doing as well with his life as he had hoped, but he will lie to her so she remains proud of him.  He misses her and wants to let her know, without directly letting her know, that he's miserable at times without her.<br /><br />Track 6: Tear--(7)--Corgan is coping with the death of a loved one.  He blames heaven for taking them away and is bitter that she can now laugh with the light while he licks his wounds in the darkness.<br /><br />Track 7: Crestfallen--(10)--This song is stunningly beautiful.  Corgan has someone in his past that he needs to re-connect with now.  They have left him but he knows they can't fully be gone because of all the memories they built together in all of the time they spent together.  He feels he doesn't deserve love and sympathy but he would love another chance with this person to prove that notion wrong.<br /><br/>Track 8: Appels + Oranjes--(6)--what if everything as you knew it ceased to exist in the way you knew it to be so?  What if you weren't the person you thought you were?  Would you choose to be something new?<br /><br />Track 9: Pug--(8)--a deeply sensual song, Corgan wants to go home with someone and spend a warm night with them, wrapped up in them, whispering sweet secrets or draining the desire from him, just being with him and being warm and desired.<br /><br />Track 10: The Tale of Dusty and Pistol Pete--(7)--a gritty, rough tale of a love gone wrong between Dusty and Pistol Pete.<br /><br />Track 11: Annie-Dog--(8)--in a battle with amphetamines, Corgan asks if it's so bad to let her take him under, into peace, knowing all that he does about the evil she can do?<br /><br />Track 12: Shame--(8)--you know you shouldn't let them get to you, you know you shouldn't question yourself, but despite all that, you're still going to feel ashamed.<br /><br />Track 13: Behold!  The Night Mare--(8)--Corgan has been trying so hard to make her happy, but he can't go on digging roses from her grave.  He knows the inevitable, that this is going to end, and he is trying to accept that all of his efforts have gone wasted.<br /><br />Track 14: For Martha--(8)--it's time for her to go, to cross over to the other side, and he will see her there.  He tells her not to cry or say goodbye because he'll be okay.  We are all in mourning for our true home since the day we are born, so he has accepted that she needs to return \\"home\\".<br /><br />Track 15: Blank Page--(9)--Corgan is coping with a lost love in this heartbreaking song.  He is miserable, he can't sleep, and he's tired of his friends offering their sympathies on the phone.  He even tortures himself further by going to look for her at the five and dime store.  He tells her to plant some trees to shade her from him and to let her children play beneath, which is quite possibly one of the saddest lines on the album.<br /><br />Track 16: 17--(6)--17 seconds of piano music, a pleasant and quiet end to such an emotionally outpouring album.exist in the way you knew it to be so?  What if you weren't the person you thought you were?  Would you choose to be something new?    Track 9: Pug--(8)--a deeply sensual song, Corgan wants to go home with someone and spend a warm night with them, wrapped up in them, whispering sweet secrets or draining the desire from him, just being with him and being warm and desired.

Track 11: Annie-Dog--(8)--in a battle with amphetamines, Corgan asks if it's so bad to let her take him under, into peace, knowing all that he does about the evil she can do?

B000002UDB|5.0|The album has been compared to a lot of hit singles. So what? Out of all the Beatles competion at the time (the Rolling Stones were about it...maybe the Kinks or the early Who) how many could boast that they wrote almost an ENTIRE album full of NO ONE singles and stuck it onto a smash hit album. Besides the album came first so that means that the HITS CAME OFF OF THE ALBUM WHICH MEANS THAT IT WASNT A &#34;GREATEST HITs SINGLES&#34; ALBUM. The album is VERY trippy and very sorrowfully overlooked and dismissed without a thought given. The songs create haunting images for anyone with an imagination and for those without one I guess thats what acid trips are all about &#60;(^_^)&#62;. Lennons and Harrisons ability to paint such lavish mental paintings filled with color and brilliance is samazing. Paul in the mean time demonstrates his use of creating fun melodies that help improve the mood before John slams down &#34;I am the Walrus&#34; and Harrisons(?) Flying. Not the best but an equal to Sgt Pepper
6303286542|5.0|Definitely one of the best videos to come out of promotion for the band. If it's a greatest hit, it's on this video. Highly recommended! Videos include, (not in order):<br /><br />From PERMANENT VACATION:<br /><br />Dude Looks Like A Lady Angel Rag Doll<br /><br />From PUMP: Love in an Elevator Janie's Got a Gun What it Takes The Other Side<br /><br />From GET A GRIP: Eat the Rich Living on the Edge Cryin' Amazing Crazy<br /><br />From BIG ONES:<br /><br />Walk on Water Blind Man Deuces Are Wild<br /><br />If many of these happen to be your favorite Aerosmith tunes, then this is the video for you. It's awesome. Sit back, relax and look. :-D
B000002UB3|4.0|The A side was good to average. Come Together, Because, Octopus's Garden and I Want You are great. The End is average...the rest is crap. No decent tune...half-assed lyrics, and no inspripation. The songs(minus the afore mentioned) arent finished by anyones standards. Hell \\"Her Magesty\\" is twenty seconds lond and is basicaly Paul talking fast. The album is in desperate need of completion. <br />
B000067J1H|5.0|I'm a 22 year old woman and I must admit that I did not want to watch this movie at all when I first saw it two years ago. My boyfriend kept saying, \\"come on, it's awesome, it's awesome\\"...so I gave in and watched it and I knew it was gonna be good when I saw those little film splices of Brad, (although, of course, I didn't know what they were), in the beginning. I knew the psychological aspects would be hard-hitting. When the credits were rolling, my jaw was still open. The underlying themes are incredible and so true, (which have to be credited to their creator, Palahniuk, who is also amazing). I read the book after I saw the movie and I definitely enjoyed the book a lot. However, I must say that \\"Invisible Monsters\\" was definitely my favorite Pahlahniuk book so far. Damn good book. But this movie was incredible. I avoided it 'cause I thought it was a typical violent guy movie, but I think I am a better person for seeing that movie. One element that always remains in my head is the point Palahniuk was trying to prove about surrounding yourself with possessions, convincing yourself that you're happy. Man....the storyline is head-shaking, it's so good. Also, I've said it before: Edward Norton is a fantastic actor. He was perfect for that role.
B000002UAU|5.0|Sgt Pepper has been reguarded as the perfect album...it's not, but it's very very very close. I think that as far as Beatles albums are conserned it is second only to Revovler or mayber the White Album. The album has an overall trippy feal to it that I like yet it never comes off as forced. With nice little Easter eggs planted in it (like the dog whistle that isn't audible to human ears)along with truly original music it is one of the few albums to get my 5 star approval.
B0001Z52RU|5.0|I thought the movie was brilliant and extremely disturbing but in a gets-in-your-brain-and-haunts-you-forever-in-a-good-way kinda way...:-p I prefer the ending that was shown in theaters, even though I'm a sap. The other two endings on the DVD were either just too damn sad/disturbing or too happy and didn't fit the story. I prefer the theatrical ending to the director's cut.
B00005JL78|4.0|This movie was great until the end. I won't give anything away. But the movie could have had a very ironic ending, but they chose to take it further and end the movie on what most seem to consider a sour note. If they had ended the movie the way you would expect it to, it would be great. However, the package and presentation is great. The bonus disc more than makes up for the ending in my opinion.
6301763041|4.0|I have so many great memories involving this movie. I saw it on Showtime when I was like, 6, and my mom was like, \\"now you're gonna want me to tape that for you, huh?\\" and I was like, \\"hellz yea!\\" when I saw him in that white/black jacket singing at the Jukebox Jamboree and any scene he's in in \\"Please Mr. Jailer\\". Mmm mmm...17 years later I still get chills watching that scene because of how freakin' fine he is. This is truly my favorite Johnny Depp movie, even if the acting is so-so and nobody's singing their own songs. ;-D
B00005JMUA|4.0|i think that Kill Bill vol 2 is better than volume 1 because it has more story and less gore than the first.  it's less gory making it more appealing to more movie watchers who are willing to shell out the cash to watch it. i like it better than the first one and think it is a great movie when you put 1 and 2 together or even watch them as seperate movies. This is one of Tarantino's better movies.
B00005JMEW|5.0|I actually preferred Volume One because there was a lot more action in it. My favorite scene was when she fights the Crazy 88's, which is weird for me, because I don't usually like fight scenes. Plus the music in Volume 1 was far superior with the Tomoyasu Hotel and Nancy Sinatra and all that. The second one was pretty damn good, though, (although I still can't watch the beginning when she gets shot...eek...too real for me). The fight with Elle definitely kicked some serious arse and when she meets B.B. is heart-wrenching, but there was a lot of Quentin's trademark dialogue in it, which, IMO, was a little overdone, i.e. the wedding rehearsal. It all depends on which you prefer, I guess. But both movies were excellent and I can't wait for the DVD of extras to come out.
B00005JKES|3.0|This rating is not actually prorated as I haven't watched anything beyond Episode 1.  THat's because Episode 1 is not the Premiere, nor is the premiere included in this set, which is the reason for my disappointment, and why I haven't continued watching.  It is apparent that, from the beginning of the series, the premiere is at the crux of the series from whence all events flow.  I had to order the 'pilot' episode from Amazon.COM (not Amazon.CA) as I guess it's not available in my country (we only have 5 miles of paved road, y'know!).  So, if you are considering buying this series, remember this caveat, and be sure to pick up the Premiere as well, or the experience will not be complete.
B0000520Q2|4.0|This movie was actually in our screenwriters' class text book...that whole Aristotle approach to movie-making...it was used as a good example that followed the structure as it was supposed to. I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. And one of the ladies I work with knows one of the actresses in the shower scene. LOL But seriously, I really enjoyed the humor and the music in this movie and I think the plotline was good, too.
B000002J09|5.0|To my everlasting shame, the first Led Zeppelin album I bought was the Early Days.  Although I had heard very little of their music the time before (just Stairway to Heaven), it's a great \\"warm-up\\" to the albums if you are just starting to listen.  I now have four albums, excluding the Early Days.  But 63% of the songs on the Untitled album are actually on the Early Days.  But that wasn't enough, I needed the album.  Being able to listen from beginning to end is an amazing 43 minutes.   <br /> <br />Im one of their fans who love their acoustic/folk repetoire.  And Im proud to say that Stairway to Heaven is not my most favorite song on the album.  In fact, its the song I least listen to.  Its been way over played in my 21 years.  But that doesn't mean I hate it; I think its the epitomy of their decade of dominance.  Every song on this album is 10/10.  The Battle of Evermore and When the Levee Breaks are both tied as my favorite.  The introduction by Bonham on the drums in the Levee gets me everytime.  It's literally thunder.   <br /> <br />I'm also a big mythology-Tolkein fan, so any songs with some affiliation to them is great as well.  This album (and I) definetly dominates on the Early Days; however, there are alot of other songs from the other albums that should have been added.  To conclude, I wouldn't not recommend Early Days; but listening to the albums is a better way to go.  Led Zeppelin is an \\"album band.\\"

B0001CCXZW|5.0|This is a brilliant show.  I love the interaction between the characters.  I give it a 10 on a scale of 1-9.
0060989157|5.0|What a long strange heroin binge this book has been. Thats what I thought after reading this decadent look at one of the trashiest rock bands in history. They almost reach the excesses of Norwegian black metal bands, with the drunk driving of Vince Neil resulting in the death of one and the paralysis of two others, the  the (possible) rape and exploitation of young women around the world by this brand of hooligans, and the crazy drug use arrests, orgies and just all around sleazy behavior. I for one could not put the book down as it told their story from each of their points of view, and it only took me two nights to read. I almost wanted more. It was a sick morbid entertainment, but an entertainment nevertheless. These guys are seriously screwed up but you do get a very human impression of them from reading this book. I would definitely recommend this book for people who are interested in the seedy side of rock and roll.
0140143505|3.0|Yes, this book is mostly charming, but somehow I was left with the feeling that by publishing those letters, the author was cashing in while patting herself in the back : &quot;Look how witty and generous I am/was...&quot;<br />This is also a VERY slim book, with, obviously, many letters missing from the actual correspondance (we get answers to unseen requests and questions). <br />So, overall, I was left with the feeling that I was not getting my money's worth, with the Paperback - 128 pages Reissue edition (September 27, 1990) at 14.00$.
B000003S0D|3.0|This is a very, very strange album - heavily avant-jazz-influenced and utterly impenetrable at turns, but never boring, and great in many places. Of course, Peter Sinfield's lyrics are laughably terrible, and add to the complete pomposity that infects the proceedings (mostly Fripp's). For that matter, Robert Fripp is in remarkably subdued form here on electric guitar, and much of his work is relegated to acoustic guitar and mellotron (which there is a lot of). Many times, he just strums along and lets the session players jam - for this is what it amounts to; many of the players here were associates of Keith Tippet, and the master pianist himself is featured quite heavily on this album on piano and electric piano. The \\"band\\", as such, pretty much quit right after the album, the musicians being Gordon Haskell on vocals and bass, Andy McCulloch on drums, and Mel Collins on saxes and flutes. Haskell and McCulloch dumped Fripp after this album, which serves him right, because both did very well on this album. McCulloch, who later drummed for Greenslade, incorporates elements of many styles within his drumming (to me, at least, it sounds like he gets a little funky on a bit of \\"Cirkus\\", besides all the obvious jazz influence), and Haskell sings very well and plays very melodic, picked bass, quite McCartney-influenced. \\"Cirkus\\" starts proceedings off well, with a ridiculously menacing Mellotron riff, and becomes a classic and totally pretentious epic, with hilariously stupid lyrics from Sinfield - I love the moment in the song when everything cuts out and the Mellotrons create such a wacky fake-string sound, before it all builds up again, with another wacky psuedo-classical guitar solo. \\"Indoor Games\\" isn't all that good, but \\"Happy Family\\" is just about the craziest song that the early incarnation ever pulled out of its' catalog, with wild electric piano runs from Tippet, jazzy rhythm and occasionally atonal lead guitar from Fripp (which sounds quite like Tippet's electric piano), heavily tremoloed Mellotron also from Fripp, saddened flute from Collins, honking trombone from Nick Evans, multifaceted drumming from McCulloch, and fantastic bass from Haskell. The most commented-upon feature of the song, aside from it's craziness, is Haskell's distorted vocals, fed through a VCS3 synthesizer, which was operated by Sinfield. If you listen to the vocal, you'll hear Sinfield switching through different effects. The first verse features this weird-as-hell echo/tremolo effect that makes Gordon sound like he's singing through a fish tank; the second verse features distortion that makes him sound like an android; the third verse features a weird phased harmonizer effect, and the fourth verse is without effects. The hush of \\"Lady of the Dancing Water\\" contains Haskell's best vocal performance with Crimson, and the \\"Lizard\\" suite is actually where the album truly goes off the rails; after the first section with Jon Anderson's vocals (I wonder how many takes it took for him to sing the lyrics with a straight face - oh, wait; this is Anderson we're talking about, so maybe he thought they needed some zipping up with talk about Siberian khatrus), it turns into an atonal noisefest without much in the way of inspiration. So it is seriously flawed, but rewarding in many ways.
B00005B36H|5.0|Tool's previous albums, namely Undertow and AEnima, were important milestones in progressive metal (if it can be said that Tool fits within a genre), and were certainly important for their time.  Thanks to Undertow, countless bands that attempted to copy Tool's sound sprung up and flooded the airwaves with similar-sounding, trite music.  AEnima was the logical - albeit unprecedented - next step, and few, if any, bands have been able to imitate its sound.  Henceforth, although its influence will be felt for many years to come, it's unlikely that any band will be able to come close to the near-perfection present on Lateralus. <br /> <br />This record is nothing less than a masterpiece.  All tracks are highlights; rating each one individually would be a waste of time.  However, as a fan who has seen Tool (Adam Jones, guitar; Danny Carey, drums; Justin Chancellor, bass; Maynard James Keenan, vocals) replicate these songs live, I can say that the true standouts on this record are \\"The Grudge\\" and the closing 3-part trilogy.  \\"The Grudge\\", as an opening statement, is about as powerful as you could hope for - intense meter shifts, pounding articulation, and overall groove separate it from the pack.  It should be noted that on this song, as on all others, Tool displays an adept touch at manipulating dynamic contrast.  AEnima featured the loud-soft shadings that Nirvana brought to the fore, but Lateralus takes it several steps further.  Dynamics range from pianissimo to triple forte on this record, hitting all stops in between.  These dynamics are most noticeable on \\"The Grudge\\". <br /> <br />From there we get more incredible tracks, including the interesting bass/guitar interplay of \\"Eon Blue Apocalypse\\", and the dirge-like, incredibly dynamically varied (again) pulse of \\"The Patient\\".  Maynard delivers positive and interesting performances, both lyrically and musically, throughout, and this track is no different.  He uses the metaphor of recovering from illness/addiction quite adeptly and somehow the message is supported by the band's playing (a characteristic inherent in all great records).  After \\"The Patient\\", the weird sounds of \\"Mantra\\" segue into \\"Schism\\", which most everyone has probably heard by now, so I won't detail it too much.  It definitely is more radio-friendly than the other songs, but that doesn't diminish its impact. <br /> <br />The first suite, \\"Parabol\\"/\\"Parabola\\", kicks off with a low-in-the-mix guitar figure, echoed by Maynard's soothing, preacher-like mentality.  It builds from there into an epic rock song with more traditional loud-soft dynamics.  This song was also a single and video, so many of you have probably heard it already.  \\"Ticks and Leeches\\" is a conventional (by Tool standards), chops-driven performance with an expansive breakdown in the middle.  It includes pounding drums, loud riffing by guitar and bass, and lots of screaming from Maynard.  The lyrics are probably symbolic, but you can always take visceral comfort in the instrumental attack of Tool's more-than-capable rhythm section. <br /> <br />A stadium-ready guitar riff opens \\"Lateralus\\", the title track on the album, and is joined around a minute later by the fade-in of Carey and Chancellor, who again concoct a furious groove.  This song employs a unique mathematical twist:  The number 987 (a term of the Fibonacci Sequence) is also a motif for the pre-verse:  its time signature cycles through 9/8, 8/8, and 7/8 before repeating.  The \\"spiraling\\" nature of the Fibonacci Sequence, when graphed, was likely an inspiration for the lyrics, which include lines like \\"Spiral out/Keep going\\".  A true epic, this song was the closer on the Lateralus tour, but here is only one highlight among an album full of them. <br /> <br />After \\"Lateralus\\" the real fun starts.  \\"Disposition\\", \\"Reflection\\", and \\"Triad\\" form a connected, 3-part suite that, yes, was performed live on the Lateralus tour.  I will condone from going into an extreme explanation of the trilogy's many parts; rather, I suggest you explore it for yourself (and try to figure out if that really is a violin in \\"Reflection\\").  In this trilogy, beautiful melodies abound, and while the playing of the band is superb, every component of the sound is perfectly balanced, adding even more sonic weight to this 23-minute epic.  Instruments such as tabla, acoustic guitar, violin(?), and sequencer are prominently featured, and lend the piece an ethereal vibe unlike any other.  Needless to say, check it out for yourself.  After the glorious trilogy, \\"Faaip de Oiad\\", which is an excerpt from an Art Bell broadcast set to machinery, closes the set.  It's very strange, but seems right, considering this is a Tool album. <br /> <br />There's not much more I could say about Lateralus that isn't regurgitation of already overdone jubilation over the record.  But it really IS that good.  And like all truly great albums, it only gets better with repeated listenings.  If Tool can top this album, they will be the metal gods of today - if they can't, this album will still serve as their magnum opus of epic proportions, a true artistic statement of unadulerated bliss.  Only time will tell.  And you, dear reader, should run out and experience all of this as soon as possible.
B0002WYS6S|5.0|This new DT DVD is great because it is much better than the Metropolis Pt.2 one.  It is sharper, the set list has more variety, James Labrie sounds 50 times better, the sound quality is ridiculous, there is behind the scenes footage with an interview with each band member, an \\"Instrumedley\\" that is a new song consisting of a section of each of DT's past intrumental pieces, and much more.  The only minor complaint I have of the DVD is that they don't perform \\"Honor Thy Father.\\"  Although it's definitely not one of my favorite songs, the opening drum fill and guitar riff are awesome, otherwise this concert DVD has no flaws.  I would highly recommend this to any DT fan, especially because I think the band plays better live than in a recording studio.
B0002DB50E|5.0|This is one of those films you absorb rather than follow. Don't try. This is a frightening Acid Trip through bizarro reality with cool and gruesome special effects and an atmposphere that's imposing and engrossing. It's everything THX1138 couldn't be. Smart, cool, thought provoking.<br /><br />Then I saw the criterion version. Great transfer, solid extras, commentary, but no surround sound? No DTS or Dolby 5.1? Why? The eerie feel if this film could be so much enhanced in a dark room, late at night with 5 speakers and a low rumbling bass speaker. But, alas, not here.<br /><br />Why clean up the film if your not going to re-mix the sound? I don't and won't ever understand, especially when you can easily include an original mix for the autur.
B0002S94OS|5.0|to be honest, i didn't like Ashes when it came out... it took about four spins before i was won over.  for me the standout tracks are: Laid To Rest, Hourglass, The Faded Line, Blood Of The Scribe, One Gun, and Break You.  I've seen these guys twice, once on the Gospel tour w/ Scissorfight, Unearth and Shadows Fall and again on the Headbangers Ball Tour last November.  if LOG comes to your town do yourself a favor and get out to see em.

B000002H2H|5.0|Ride the Lightning is truly an amazing effort by James Hetfield, Lars Ulrich, Cliff Burton, Dave Mustaine and the new Kirk Hammett. Mustaine may have left during the Kill 'em All era but that doesn't mean his influence left too, in songs which he made like the title track and 'The Call of Ktulu' he proves that he is 100x better a guitarist than Kirk (although Kirk is amazing too) and Kirk just ended up making more melodic and musically better solos while Dave had the more talented ones. Did I mention Kirk makes his first original solos here? Yeah he does, they sure sound great too even if Daves were better talent-wise. James Hetfields lyrics have matured too, in Kill 'em All he just sang the whole \\"we're a band\\" thing which was annoying as hell, although sometimes he sang about novels but in Ride the Lightning he sings about death, destruction and war (like in the review title). Cliff was always the greatest bassist and on this album, while not as talented as he is on MOP he shines through the instrumental and on the many songs he is credited on. Lars' drumming has also gotten more complex and varied, while on Kill 'em All they were being pounded on like hell. Overall this album is a huge step in maturity than on Kill. <br />   The songs on this album are much better too, especially the structure. Each song has its own signature intro and the best is on 'For Whom the Bell Tolls' which is my personal favorite. Other gold tracks include the title track, 'Fade to Black', 'Fight Fire with Fire', 'The Call of Ktulu' and 'Creeping Death'. Fade to Black is also the bands first ballad, which also makes this album worth more than it already is (which is a lot). It talks about suicide in a first person perspective, it shows just how much of a poet James Hetfield is. <br />I'll rate the songs in order now: <br />Best-For Whom the Bell Tolls A++++++ <br />2nd Best-Ride the Lightning A+ <br />3rd Best-Fade to Black A+ <br />middle-The Call of Ktulu A <br />middle II-Fight Fire with Fire A- <br />3rd Worst-Creeping Death A- <br />2nd Worst-Trapped Under Ice B <br />Worst-Escape D+ <br /> <br />Okay, all in all this is a great album and while not as awesome or melodic as Master of Puppets it should still find a home in any metalheads collection...hell this will belong in even a punk fans collection since I had that when I used to be a Ramones fanatic. Well, just buy it!
0553573403|4.0|Most of the reviews here for this book have nothing but great things to say about the plot. I don't disagree. It's unique, imaginative, well thought out, surprising, and best of all, very entertaining. Martin is a very talented writer. That said, I have a few qualms with this novel. There is a very large amount of characters involved in the story and it takes the author several hundred pages to introduce them all. This 'introduction period' at times can get to feeling a lot like a medievil soap opera due to all of the scene switching  between characters. When all is said and done though, the various interweaving stories come together quite nicely- quite a reward for the reader.<br /><br />My other issue with this book is the overwhelming sexual content. I don't have a problem with characters in a book having sexual relationships with eachother. But it seemed to me that of the author's descriptions of sex acts were present not only to develop the story but to be titilating to the reader.<br /><br />So, if you don't mind reading vivid descriptions of sex acts between grown men and thirteen year old girls (not an exageration) and you want to read a truly original and entertaining fantasy novel, pick this one up.
B000002H33|5.0|Yeah thats right! I dont care if it only sold 500,000 copies unlike the second best album of the eighties 'Back in Black' or #3 'Appetite for Destruction', and those albums sold 19 million and 10 million records. This album will truly blow any metalhead away, its chock full of classic metal songs and extreme solos. Plus this is also the final album with Master Burton and on this album he proves he IS the master of bassists with his solo on the instrumental 'Orion'. This is definately one of the best albums of all time and easily the best Metallica record. <br />  The band has not changed much since 'Ride the Lightning' (which is the 4th greatest album of the 80's) but their songs have become a bit more complex and aimed toward an angry edge where as in Lightning it was aimed toward a joyous grandeur with classics like the title track, 'For Whom the Bell Tolls', 'Fade to Black' and 'The Call of Ktulu'. This is not an exact replica of Lighning, in fact many fans will find this quite different. For example: Instead of talking about death ('Ride the Lighning') and fighting ('For whom the Bell Tolls') they talk about mastery ('Master of Puppets') and have speed metal songs too ('Battery'). With this album, Metallica proved that they could easily go gold without any singles and/or videos and while still being thrash.  <br />  Right, now I'll rate the songs: <br />1. Battery: This song is very similsr to RTL's 'Fight Fire with Fire' and has an acoustic intro followed by sudden slam of eardrum pounding metal with a very fast chorus and speedy verses with two very dynamic solos. This album truly starts off on a great note with this song. 10/10 <br />2. Master of Puppets: Probably the best song on the album and unlike RTL's title track this song has an interlude after the second chorus which makes the song much more interesting with two of the best solos on the album, Kirk really takes what he learned from Dave Mustaine and puts it to great use. Any true metalhead would buy this album just for this song. 100/10 <br />3. The Thing that Should not be: Topping off at 6 minutes and 36 seconds this song combines the Kill 'em All Metallica with the RTL kind making a great song with one of Kirks fastest solos ever. 10/10 <br />4. Welcome Home (Sanitarium): I call this one #2 because thats exactly what it is, the second best song on this album. I thought 'Fade to Black' was awesome and then I heard this, it made that ballad sound like ass (Fade is still an awesome ballad). The most haunting of riffs showers this song with majesty and complexity with some of the best bass playing I've ever heard from Master Burton. This ballad can only be matched by 'One' from ...And Justice for All. 20/10 <br />5. Disposeable Heroes: While side A of Puppets was above perfect side B demonstrates what RTL did, which is above average, but nothing compared to the beginning. This song is back to the heaviness but is nothing like the title track or 'Battery', but I still love it. This song comes in at 8 minutes and 14 seconds which is a big reason why it isn't that good...its just too damn long!! However the guitar solo more than makes up for this flaw and James' lyrics are complex and meaningful. 7/10 <br />6. Leper Messiah: I look at this song as filler, its better than 'Escape' from RTL but it still is not that good...at all, its fair/average but nothing too great. 6/10 <br />7. Orion: YES!! We've made to the song where Cliff Burton fianlly proves that he can kick any bass players ass! This song is nothing like 'The Call of Ktulu' from RTL and I'm sick of people saying that \\"this is better\\" because it isn't, you really cant compare the two. This song is more complex than previous instrumentals and while not as good as Ktulu its still amasterpiece and makes up for Leper Messiah. This is NOT the best instrumental of all time, 'To Live is to Die' from ...And Justice for All is but this will still keep you banging your head all the way through. 12/10 <br />8. Damage Inc.: This album ends in a bang with this song, its truly a masterpiece. Hell this is the reason why I bought the album in the first place, its only just over five minutes but it still has fast verses, a heavy chorus and above all the greatest bass intro ever by Master Burton, this rocks! <br />  All right then. Now you can see that of the eight songs roughly seven of them are good and none of them are bad (Leper Messiah is okay) so seriously, are you going to keep reading like 20 million other reviews before you buy this or are you just going to buy it!? Just buy it! You wont be disappointed. Oh yeah and I also recommend these other Metallica albums: <br />1. Kill Em' All-9/10 <br />2. Ride the Lightning-11/10 <br />3. Master of Puppets-12/10 (RIP Cliff Burton) <br />4. ...And Justice for All-9/10 (Production sucks) <br />5. Metallica/Black Album-8/10 (Too simple) <br />The following CDs are crappy and should be avoided at all costs: <br />1. Load-4/10 (not Metallica, alternative) <br />2. Reload-2/10 (definately not Metallica, too repetative) <br />3. St. Anger-0/10 (Ahhh! The downfall of a great band! NOOOOO!!)
0345350499|1.0|I am a pagan feminist, and glad to have been raised in the New Age movement by my mother, who counts this as one of her all-time favorites. Not to mention that I've always been fascinated with Celtic mythology and the Arthurian tales, to the point of taking courses in college about them. Should this book, then, not have been right up my alley? Alas, no. BOTH times I have tried to read it, I have ground to a halt because of the dark sickness it makes me feel.  <br /> <br />I tried to read it the first time when I was eighteen, as I was taking a Middle English Romance Epics class at FSU. I loved reading about the Arthurian stories in all their different forms over the centuries, and I thought one with a modern, feminist twist would be ideal. I'd known about Mists for years, had heard my mom and her friends describe it as though it were the definitive strong-spiritual-female story. Instead what I found was a story about women who treated one another and themselves like crap, and whom the author never stopped putting through horrific, hopeless ordeals. I know the story, I know it contains betrayals and tragedy. Most good stories do, because life does. But the relish with which they, and the emotional and physical agony they cause, are described...yuck. I was shocked, upset, almost physically ill by the time I gave up 3/4 way through. And this coming from someone who spent her teen years repeatedly reading, among other things, long Stephen King and Anne Rice novels.  <br /> <br />I tried reading it again this year, at 25, thinking that I may have been too young to see whatever value it obviously has to so many women. Thinking also, that I may have been just going through an emotionally sensitive phase back then, when graphic depictions of agony, cruel disloyalty, and morbid psychological issues might have creeped me out overmuch. I didn't even get halfway through this time. Honestly, I have no idea why anyone finds this inspiring or feminist, it seems the exact oppositeto me. None of the characters are likeable at all, and the women are \\"strong\\" only if \\"strong\\" means \\"manipulative, cruel and hardheaded\\" to you. The honor, courage, and compassion that not only define \\"strength\\" to me, but that have made the Arthurian legends so powerful to so many people over the ages, are utterly absent here. There is a light that's just missing, and what's left is a feeling of claustrophobic brutality, both between the characters, and in the author's treatment of the story. My perception that there is something horribly wrong with this book was confirmed. I put it down and resolved never to pick it up again. <br /> <br />Don't get me wrong, I can see the appeal. A Goddess-loving version of a timeless classic is a wonderful idea that I wish were more common! Sadly, it seems that that political and spiritual novelty is all this book really has going for it. Frankly, it has none of the love and loyalty that to me are the backbone of both great old epics and the new spiritual movements. Feminist women, Goddess-loving women, and New Age women are probably going to continue to like this book because of its concept, which can be truly revelatory and life-changing if it's your first exposure to it. But there are better modern retellings of the Arthurian story, as well as better modern Goddess-oriented epics--stories with more hope and inspiration than this. Enjoy this if it appeals to you, but remember, it's not the best--only the first. <br /> <br />In short, you'll probably either love this novel or be immensely turned off by it.  Check it out of the library. If you find the first couple of chapters enthralling, you should buy it, because you'll probably be one of those who do love it and are changed by it. If you begin to read it and feel a sense that dark, gloomy clouds are gathering inside you, and that you're reading a barbaric, hopeless soap opera, just stop and put the book away, because that darkness ain't gonna let up. You'll probably know ifyou're meant to read this or not, and more power to you either way. <br /> <br />BTW, if you strongly need historical or archaological/anthropological accuracy, stay the hell away from this. It's a fantasy, folks. Come on.  :)
B000063UR2|5.0|As long as unicorns roam the earth evil can never harm the pure of heart, and that is why the prince of Darkness has sent his most foulest goblins out into the very daylight he seeks to destroy forever to cut off the horns of the last two remaining. But when Jack (the forest boy, played by a very young Tom Cruise) takes Lily (a royal princess, played by the beautiful Mia Sara) to see them, she does the forbidden and touches these ancient creatures. Lily soon discovers it was she who unintentionally lured the unicorns into the goblin's trap; enabling them to shoot the poison stinger into one of the \\"beasts\\", as they call them, with a clear view. She vows to make things right again as the land becomes shrouded in a blanket of snow and tries to protect the last unicorn standing but is too frail to defend even herself. She then is captured, along with the unicorn, and taken back to the great tree where the wicked come to sacrifice. There the prince of Darkness yearns for a companion and tries to make Lily one of them by tempting her with jewels and power while Jack and his new friends Gump, a jealous sprite and some other nymphs, device a plan to save Lily, the unicorn, and the world before it's covered in eternal shadow.<br /><br />Legend wasn't too well received in theaters and was not a favorite among most critics but it has quickly become a cult classic with fantasy lovers like me. Considering the low budget director Ridley Scott was given in order to make this film in the mid-80s, I thought they did a wonderful job in bringing William Hjortsberg's dark fairytale to life, which was written specifically for the screen. I also felt the entire cast put on remarkable performances - especially Tim Curry who went through hell (pun intended) to look as devilish as he does here...<br /><br />Within this two-disc set is two versions of the film. One is the director's cut, as it was intended to be seen, and the other is the U.S. theatrical version, which I personally prefer, as do many others apparently. There are many extended scenes in the director's cut that were taken out of the U.S. release to trim down the overall running time but I felt the U.S. version simply flowed better. It also features a more dramatic score by Jerry Goldsmith instead of the more emotional score by Tangerine Dream and doesn't include the closing credits song \\"Is Your Love Strong Enough?\\" by Brian Ferry, ending the movie on a more magical note. But still, it was nice to see both versions and to compare the two. There's also a lot of bonus materials in the limited edition of Legend that many fans will be very grateful for.ers apparently.

B00005JNBQ|5.0|I've seen this movie three times and my kids have seen it 5 times each. We all love it because it is very funny and sweet. Jon Heder is perfect as Napoleon and his friends and family are priceless. Even the high school queen bees and jocks aren't all that mean. Everyone is just human and most of them will remind you at least a little of someone you went to high school with. Endlessly quotable and a lot of fun!
B00005JNEU|5.0|Ever since Peter Bogdanovich, in THE LAST PICTURE SHOW, provided a comic view of a small town's total involvement in the fortunes of a high school football team (remember the verbal abuse the locals heaped on Jeff Bridges and Timothy Bottoms when they lost the 'big game'?), Hollywood has attempted, with varying degrees of success, to make the 'definitive' small town/football film.<br /><br />Director Peter Berg has finally done it, with FRIDAY NIGHT LIGHTS!<br /><br />Based on H. G. Bissinger's best-selling tale of the 1988 season of  the Odessa (Texas) 'Permian Panthers', the film unflinchingly paints a vivid canvas of a school and community obsessed with winning, as football provides the only release from poverty and desperation. While the concept is reminiscent of Tom Cruise's earlier ALL THE RIGHT MOVES, Berg doesn't glamorize the hero or tie things up, neatly, at the climax; in real life, while victories are savored, they are, at best, a temporary 'high'...while defeats can drive rational people into irrational frenzies. The Panthers' fortunes are such a crutch to Odessa's emotional well-being, that each game becomes a narcotic 'fix' for the entire community...a situation potentially dangerous for the players, and their coaches.<br /><br />While Billy Bob Thornton has received the bulk of media attention, as the stern but fair head coach (with glowing reviews for BAD SANTA, and THE ALAMO, Thornton is having a career-defining year!), the film is really an ensemble work, with stand-out performances by Lucas Black, Derek Luke, Garrett Hedlund, and, surprisingly, singer Tim McGraw (as Hedlund's 'reliving past glories' father). The entire cast is exceptional, avoiding the easy pitfalls of simply playing stereotypes.<br /><br />At times brutal and gritty, at times nearly surrealistic, FRIDAY NIGHT LIGHTS refuses to fall into the clich&eacute;s that marred VARSITY BLUES and THE PROGRAM, eschewing the artsy but smug self-righteousness of Oliver Stone's ANY GIVEN SUNDAY, as well.<br /><br />This may well be the finest football film ever made...as well as one of the most honest portrayals of life in a small town.<br /><br />I will be surprised if it doesn't make most critics' 'Ten Best' lists, at year's end, and is a major Oscar contender.<br /><br />Peter Berg has gotten the formula right!UNDAY, as well. <br />  <br />This may well be the finest football film ever made...as well as one of the most honest portrayals of life in a small town. <br />  <br />I will be surprised if it doesn't make most critics' 'Ten Best' lists, at year's end, and is a major Oscar contender. <br />  <br />Peter Berg has gotten the formula right!     <br />
B000060P79|3.0|AWESOME CD! whether u like punk, pop, rock, wutever you hav to luv this cd.

Well, if u took the time 2 read this whole review, thanx and buy the cd if u haven't already <br />
B000002U94|4.0|This album is one of about ten that shaped my early adult life.  I was an 18-year-old student when it was released. and it still burns in my soul, nearly a quarter of a century on.  I can almost track the fate of my first great love through the songs.  \\"You'll Accompany Me\\", \\"We've Got Tonight\\", \\"Night Moves\\", and, of  course, \\"Fire Down Below\\". The only track missing from that particular allusion is \\"The Famous Final Scene\\".  <br /> <br />Like other reviewers, I think this album is crying out for a remaster than restores its original running time in full, and presents the full glory of Chuck Berry's \\"Let It Rock\\", even if it means switching to a 2-disc format.  Look what they did with Lynyrd Skynyrd's \\"One More From The Road\\", last year?!  The whole thing remastered onto two CDs, using the original 2-inch tapes as the source. <br /> <br />Come on, guys!  What's stopping ya?!
630542845X|5.0|Powder is an in depth film that shows just how cruel people can be to people that are different from themselves. It takes place in a small town in Texas where Powder was locked in his grandparents basement for most of his life. They die when hes a teen (he's 16 i think?) and he is picked up by the local sheriff and brought to a school for him to learn. The shock is that he is pure white and bald so immediately he stands out and since hes not really had any interactions with people except in the books he read, he is a total outcast. He befriends a girl that doesn't think hes too different until he gets just a little too close to electricity. What happens next is phenominal. This is definately a movie that will touch your heart in one way or another. All you guys out there, if you want a date movie this is one to check out since it mixes all the elements to be a \\"chick flick\\", but no it isn't one. Its just a touching story that will leave you wondering how society treats people that are different and that in a way, we know it'll never change but we at least know it does happen.
B00005JNEI|5.0|This movie is a blessing.  I don't see how the opinions in this movie can be seen as lies, unless you're relentlessly trying to defend George W. <br /> <br />I'm sick of all the Michael Moore bashing.  'Rallying around the president' opinion...Bush is using it for all its worth.  I'm happy to see a film to tell it like it is. <br /> <br />A scene where Bush is telling people to watch terrorists, then continues on with his game of golf is pathetic.   <br /> <br />Again, I'm happy that we have a film that isn't afraid to give the facts:  about the homeland security, the fact that this war is not crucial - like Bush wants us to think, throwing the threat of terrorism in our face.  This is an important film, I don't think that all the right-wing people should talk bad about. <br /> <br />You should see this film, if you haven't already.
B00008MZ0N|5.0|This is a movie that I love watching every once in a while. What can I say, who doesn't like to speed and drag race (oops did I say that outloud?). Anyways this movie is about a cop who must infiltrate a illegal street racing circuit and find out who is fencing stolen goods. Not too hard of a task till he falls for the sister of his number one suspect. He becomes more involved with his new gang then his job asks for and pretty soon, he has to decide which is more priority. A definate must see movie. The only problem I had was the fact that you watch these guys street race and they show the speedometer and it shows them going from 45-60 MPH. In NY here we go from 65mph and up (when cops arn't around of course) and this is in anything from sports cars to rustbuckets. These guys are suppose to have high performance $100,000 engines and stuff, they should of showed them going a little faster than that. Anywyas check this movie out if you havn't already.
0671027344|4.0|My daughter (16) read this book before I did and said she really liked it and I caught her laughing aloud while reading it (as I did too).  I loved the way the author writes as Charlie, as it is how my own muddled confused thoughts zip through my head even now, not to mention as a freshman in high school.  I love the  line, \\"It's like looking at all the students and wondering who's had their heart broken that day, and how they are able to cope with having three quizzes and a book report on top of that.\\"  Have you ever looked at people and thought about that? Even as an adult much less a young person just starting to \\"participate\\".  I highly recommend this book to both mature teenagers (do those two words go together?)and semi-mature adults who still wrestle with the same experiences.<br /><br />**The quality of the current paperback binding is not good, the pages come out very easily** but please don't let this stop you from reading it.
B00004Z4WR|5.0|This is the movie before Fast and the Furious where we first saw all these sweet cars. You can tell most of the reviewers have seen Fast and Furious so they are comparing this movie to that which it is not. It does have its stupid humor to it but what action movie doesn't once in a while? Everyone already explained the plot so i'm not going to put you through that, what i will say is that it is definately one to check out. Not as good as Fast and the Furious since that movie wrecked any greatness we could expect from this movie (sorry but yes, it makes gone in 60 seconds sub par). Get a copy for your collection and if you find it cheap enough, you'll feel good that you didn't spend that much :)
B000001FA4|4.0|The success of 1983's WAR had given U2 a very definite image in the minds of fans and critics - that of a fiery, politically charged and decidedly song-oriented band that compensated for its relative lack of musical sophistication with catchy hooks and instantly memorable melodies. So it came as more than a bit of a surprise to many people that the follow-up album, THE UNFORGETTABLE FIRE, was - and twenty years later remains - far and away U2's most impressionistic work, a dense and moody exploration of texture and atmosphere over riffery and songcraft with lots of mumbled, cut-and-paste lyrics which tend to augment rather than clarify the fogginess of their surrounding instrumental landscapes. Although the roots of nearly everything U2 would go on to do over the next two decades can be heard in some form somewhere on this album, THE UNFORGETTABLE FIRE is still a unique and at times downright perplexing entry in the group's catalogue.     Replacing founding producer Steve Lillywhite (who'd had no small hand in making them stars) with the big-signature team of Brian Eno and Daniel Lanois, the members of U2 make it clear right from the credits that they're after something new here. With two of the ten tracks eulogizing Martin Luther King, Jr., and others sporting titles such as \\"Fourth of July\\" and \\"Elvis Presley and America,\\" it's also obvious Bono and Company want to make a point of their growing interest in life across the Atlantic - although their music, at this stage, still has a decidedly European accent.     Having opened three consecutive albums with big, bombastic, arena-ready anthems, U2 here displays its newly broadened sonic pallette right off the bat with \\"A Sort of Homecoming,\\" a surging yet very nuanced power ballad of war and renewal with all the ambient stops pulled out as only Eno and Lanois can pull them, and only Larry Mullen's metronomic drumming to keep things from floating away altogether. Abstract it may be, but it's also quite effective, and leaves no question that this is a new U2 we're dealing with here. \\"Pride (In the Name of Love),\\" the album's only hit single, brings back the old, riff-driven U2, with a chiming, digitally delayed guitar track by the Edge that would define the band's sound for years to come. An homage to the slain Reverend King (who's also celebrated in the album's dreamy, drumless closer, \\"MLK\\"), the song actually sounds quite upbeat amidst the slow gloom around it. \\"Wire\\" is a lyrical mishmosh redeemed by a driving instrumental track which sounds like updated WAR material. The title track is almost certainly the strongest thing here, a painfully beautiful song of loss and resignation (about what, however, isn't quite clear) with sweeping synthesizers coloring one of Bono's most emotive performances. The singer is also outstanding on \\"Bad,\\" the lengthy elegy which highlights THE UNFORGETTABLE FIRE's second half, though once again the digital delay takes a fair amount of the spotlight as well.     The rest of the album consists of rather dark and hazy soundscapes which are only periodically tuneful in a conventional sense, and so only as strong or as weak as their various components - at times inspired and effecting, at others meandering and faceless. If one considers U2 a band worth listening to for its nuances alone (I do), there are enough good moments to make the trip worthwhile; if not, THE UNFORGETTABLE FIRE probably doesn't qualify as an essential purchase, especially since most of its best moments are included on the BEST OF 1980-1990 anthology. What is unquestionable, however, is that this album was a huge step forward for U2, one the band would build on to create some of the most important music of its era over the next few years.
B0000AMJED|5.0|Its hard to say if this one is better than the original as there are differences between the two. First off the first had people you could really care about because it had the tension and acceptance for Brian and the drama of the gang finding out he was a cop. This one on the other hand is so fast paced that you can't tell what people are really thinking and what their reaction is going to be (Well it is Miami you know). This movie shows more about the cars and really, how tricked out they could be, expecially with great neons lights added to them (nice computer graphics there with the racing sequences as well). Pretty much the plot is Brian is on the run from helping a fugitive back in Fast and the Furious. He gets muscled by the FBI to either take down a drug lord by being one of his drivers. He tells the FBI that he wants to bring another driver with him and to have his record cleaned as well (which would of looked good with Vin being there). Lots of speed, sarcasm diaglog and great cars with the girls that go with them, this movie is meant to be a high impact fast paced movie. The only problem that I had was that Mia (Brians love interest from the first movie) was nowhere in this movie which almost made no sense since you had the impression that they were still good together when the first movie ended. If you like fast paced action or cars in general, a great movie to check out. If you don't like them... well see it anyways.
B00005JNEI|4.0|Yes, Michael Moore has an agenda. However, every documentary does. Believe it or not folks, but a documentary does not just show reality, it also interprets it. The point of a documentary is for those who see it to start making their own judgments. If you don't agree with Michael Moore's interpretation of the why's of the Iraq war, what is the right interpretation? Can you use the facts or find more facts to come up with a different interpretation? I would call that highly unlikely, but I would like to see the interpretation. This documentary set out to answer the question \\"Why is the US in Iraq?\\" I can tell you I have asked that question a lot and I found no good reason. Michael Moore has done the same thing, just to a larger audience. While you might disagree with his assessment that it was strictly for money, it is hard to support a different view after seeing this movie. You would be hard pressed to find any evidence linking Iraq and Al-Qaeda. Why? Because it doesn't exist. No matter how much Bush railed for a link, even he had to admit it wasn't there.<br /><br />How can you refute the 7 minutes of inactivity of Mr. Bush in the Florida classroom on 9/11? How can you refute the fact that planes were loaded up with Bin Laden relatives on 9/13? How can you call the \\"coalition of the willing\\" a coalition if it includes countries that send no troops? These are the facts folks. Michael Moore interpreted them to slam the Bush administration.

Arendt's argument was that the banal evil demonstrated by Eichmann can wreck far more havoc than any diabolical motives.
B000002H33|5.0|And damnit man Metallica did win with their epic 1986 studio album, Master of Puppets. Seeing as how I am not that good of a paragraph summarizer, I'm going to give a thorough song-by-song review of this product:    Track Listing:    1.Battery: Absolutely brilliant acoustic guitar intro, the rest of the song is pure greatness like the rest of early Metallica but the acoustic opening is the most brilliant standout on this song. Therefore I'm giving it 2 ratings:  Overall: 12/10  Acoustic guitar:38/15 (15 means well rehearsed acoustic)    2.Master of Puppets: One of Metallica's greatest over 8-minute epics. Metallica shows here that they are more than just thrashers, they are speed metal geniuses thru and thru. Not just one of the greatest Metallica songs, but also a landmark for speed metal and thrash metal alike. Showed the world that Metallica is the premier speed metal band.  Overall:ABSOLUTELY BRILLIANT!    3.The Thing That Should Not Be: Some of the greatest bass guitaring ever! Cliff Burton shines on this track like Les Claypool never could. Also has some wicked guitar solos by Kirk Hammett, bloody brilliant.  Overall:BLOODY BRILLIANT!    4.Sanitarium (Welcome Home): The masterpiece that Fade to Black only dreamt of being. Perhaps one of the greatest metal ballads in existence. The guitar solo by Hammett in the middle is brilliance as usual.  Overall:50/10    5.Disposable Heroes: Makes Trapped Under Ice and Creeping Death seem like Elementary school. The instruments and vocals are more evolved than ever and the 8-min+ never gets old. In fact it makes you wish this song was 16 minutes long!  Overall:Evolution to the 10th power.    6.Leper Messiah: The least impressive song on this album but still great. The lowest a song on here could get is 10/10.    7.Orion (instrumental): In my opinion the greatest instrumental done by Metallica. Cliff Burton shows off his Jimi Hendrix like bass playing ability. All of Metallica's earliest instrumentals have Cliff Burton's excellent bass playing and this one is no exception. The rest of the band also does a stellar job with drums(Lars Ulrich), guitars(Kirk Hammett), and rhythm guitars(James Heitfeld).  Overall:Infinity/10    8.Damage,Inc.: One of Metallica's really heavy tracks. The beginning is soft but then leads to full own metal guitar explosion. Great even after they butchered the famous :\\"f#ck it all with f#cking no regrets\\" line in St. Anger.  Overall: 25/10 (Even St. Anger can't butcher this song)    Also recommended:    Metal Works '73-'93 -Judas Priest  Peace Sells...but Who's Buying(I am!) -Megadeth  Reign in Blood -Slayer  Randy Rhoads Tribute -Ozzy Live!  Ride the Lightning -Metallica  Ac/Dc Live  Different Stages Live -Rush  The Missing Link -Rage (German metal band)    P.S.: myxokse, the product is Master of Puppets, not Rust in Pieces. If you are going to write a review on Rust in Pieces write it for that product, not for this product. It's called Master of Puppets by Metallica and unless you are going to write a review for Master of Puppets, then get out of here. Megadeth has some big props for them, but this is a review for a Metallica album, so at least 50% of your review should be for Master of Puppets. Oh and Stone Cold, this is more than just better than St. Anger, its way better than St. Anger! I appreciate your reminder for people not to listen to that Anger garbage though.
B00009UW0N|5.0|\\"Halloween\\" completely took the industry by surprise. This low-budget thriller made more money in relation to its cost than just about any other horror movie of its time. It's simple premise paved the way for hundreds of imitators (including the string of sequels produced only one of which Carpenter had anything to do with--\\"Halloween II was co-scripted by Carpenter with partner Debra Hill)but none of them had quite the style of this chiller.<br /><br />Michael Myers murders his sister on Halloween in 1963 as our story begins. Committed to a mental hosptial, Myers escapes on Halloween in 1978 returning to the town where he grew up. He effectively acts out the murder that started it all by picking on a bunch of hopeless helpless teens. Although Myers' doctor Sam Loomis(the always superb Donald Pleasance. A bit of trivia is that the character isnamed in tribute to one of the characters from \\"Psycho\\")had tried his best to cure Myers, he was unsucessful. When Loomis discovers that Myers escaped, he knows exactly where he's going and what he's going to do. Loomis heads to Haddenfield the town where Myers grew up in hopes of stopping the boy/man from killing again.<br /><br />Myers fixates on Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis, daughter of the late, great Janet Leight from \\"Psycho\\" and Tony Curtis)an innocent babysitter. Myers begins stalking her and her friends on the Halloween.<br /><br />Although there are some plot contrivances that make \\"Halloween\\" less than believable, once the action starts you're willing to overlook many of these. Films such as \\"Scream\\" have taken the ideas that started out here as fairly new to films and turned these cliches inside out. More importantly, Carpenter's taunt direction, musical score and the performances of Pleasance and Curtis make \\"Halloween\\" more than just a low-budget exploitation film. This film literally helped make Carpenter's career as a director, Curtis and Debra Hill's as a producer/writer.<br /><br />This beautifully rendered remaster looks terrific. Although this doesn't include the extended sequences shot for the TV airing of the movie (which were shot quite a bit after the movie had become a box office success) integrated into the film, that's all for the better. The new sequences that were shot were fine but ultimately hurt the pacing of this slick thriller. The impassive mask Myers wears creates a sense of terror (it's a mask of William Shatner. Who better than the \\"Captain\\" of the Enterprise to become a serial killer?). There are numerous inside jokes scattered throughout the film; Leigh Brackett the name of the sheriff in the movie was a science fiction writer and screenwriter (she co-wrote \\"Rio Bravo\\" and \\"The Empire Strikes Back\\"). There are also references to other Howard Hawks and Hitchcock movies throughout the film<br /><br />The extras include a great commentary track featuring Carpenter, Curtis and producer Hill. The nearly 90 minute documentary \\"Halloween: A Cut Above the Rest\\" provides a great peak at the cast and crew twenty-five years after the movie premiered. \\"On Location-25 Years Later\\" is a decent featurette where actress P.J. Soles (\\"Carrie\\" and this movie of course) and Hill go back to the house that was used for Myers' home in the movie. We also get what would be considered hokey TV spots now (but weren't then), radio ads, poster and still gallery and talent biographies. The only thing missing is the extra footage for the TV premiere. Although I wouldn't want it integrated back into the version I saw in theaters in 1978, I wouldn't mind having them in a TV version of the movie as it was presented in the previous special limited edition boxed set.<br /><br />Highly recommended although those raised on the parody films of the genre will probably not appreciate the impact Carpenter's first box-office success (he had made \\"Dark Star\\" and the great \\"Assault on Precint 13\\" prior to \\"Halloween\\" and had sold a script which eventually was butchered and turned into \\"TheEyes of Laura Mars\\"), it's still a creepy thriller after all these years.ned into \\"The Eyes of Laura Mars\\"), it's still a creepy thriller after all these years.  <br /> <br />
B0000DD7LC|1.0|This album SUCKS! This is one of those \\"MTV\\" albums that turns disposable every 2 to 3 weeks. She is famous only because of her pretty looks. If it was an overweight woman singing this, you would not have ever heard of this album. Alicia keys has no frikkin talent!    Highlight: You just realised your RNB sucks. Its a good thing.
B00003CXCT|4.0|[rating: 5 stars for these true classics of American film, minus one for padding their re-release with extra footage that bogs down the pace] <br /> <br />When I saw the first series of Star Wars movies as a child, I was transported by the stark, Manichean outlines of George Lucas's mythology.  I bought plastic action figures and light-sabers, braved noxious glue fumes to piece together model X-wings and Millennium Falcons.  I was hooked! <br /> <br />Now that the newer, more technology-driven prequels have arrived, there is a tendency to criticize the themes of these films as trite--a guileless, desperate, outnumbered good, faced with an implacable and unfathomable evil.  And indeed, there was a moment some 20 years after _Star Wars_ appeared when its lessons seemed quaintly simplistic to me, either because I'd grown up, or because America had:  grown far beyond childish dualism to a sophisticated appreciation of the complexities and subtleties of a world best described in shades of gray.  <br /> <br />And then 9/11 engulfed us, and suddenly things were simple again.  Much like Luke, we seemed locked in a struggle against Evil itself.  A terrible storm was at hand, a day of reckoning.  And today I worry for my country, not because the simple moral lessons of Star Wars are so relevant once more, but because we seem so bent on ignoring them.  To our leaders, perhaps, Osama bin Laden is the archetypal Vader figure, menacing the courageous Rebels that comprise our Western world...but what was it Vader said to ensnare Luke in _Empire_? \\"Luke...release your anger!  Only your hatred can destroy me!\\"   <br /> <br />The Imperial enemy was indeed an evil worthy of eradication, but the obvious path--that of unchecked vengeance and destruction--led only to ruin and damnation, the Dark Side of the Force.  Now, in our own response to 9/11, we seem determined to hurl ourselves headlong into the same fundamental trap. Ruled by pain, fear, willful self-deception, and reflexive rageat an enemy whom we insist on glibly misreading, we've electively invaded a country that had *nothing* to do with 9/11, inflamed the entire Muslim world against us, and adopted a bunker mentality toward our own proud tradition of civil liberty that seems likely to destroy more of it than it preserves.  To the 3,000 murdered on that fateful day we have now added a thousand brave soldiers, over 10,000 Iraqi lives, $200 BILLION tax dollars, and priceless international credibility, all to give Osama bin Laden exactly what he wants: a riven, joyless world, set ablaze with enduring hatred.  Listen closely, and you can almost hear the Emperor gloating at the spectacles of Guantanamo, Abu Ghraib, and Fallujah.  A Jedi craves not these things, but fights out of necessity, with eyes open. <br /> <br />I think both Obi-Wan and Yoda would've agreed with the war philosopher Sun Tzu, who said, \\"If you know the enemy and know yourself, you need not fear the results of a hundred battles.\\"  Our leaders have done the nation a great disservice in failing to do either.  But unlike Star Wars, our final episode is not yet written.  Whatever happens in Iraq, whether or not we kill bin Laden and a hundred like him, there is still time to step back from the brink and remember who we are, still time to avoid the most grievous loss of all: that of our own ideals, freedom, honor, and humanity.  As FDR famously reminded us, we need not be governed by fear even in the darkest of times.  The first step toward positive change need not be perfect, but it must come soon.  November 2 is approaching.  <br /> <br />You know what to do.
B0001AP12G|5.0|I writing this review 'cause It's one of the best he put this year. That's why he's one my favorite rappers to date. I always admire Kanye 'cause he has a kindred spirit in him about what he is, what he does, and how he provide it. That's why he names his album THE COLLEGE DROPOUT because he wasn't learning properly or not learning fast enough. That to me doesn't mean I don't have to dropout of school early, y'know. Just to let me know that I had to learn more proper than that. The fact is that you had to work hard on what you do and how you want to achieve it. Simple. Whatever you got stuff on your mind you have to face (asides music), you had to take it real seriously. <br />When I'm done w/ school, I know I'll be ready to face a music career or not. Anyway, I wanna tell ya'll I didn't buy the explicit version, y'know. I only bought the edited version just in case it'll be easy to listen without the cussing in it. Sometimes it hard to pick up the right one you like best.  <br /> <br />When I first started hearing him on the radio and all that, I had in my mind, I was like, \\"Whoa! I need to find out who this artist is. 'cuz He have a new spirit in him.\\" That's why I went in and bought his album to see how he looks like and/or sounds like. I remember reading him on the SOURCE magazine one time to see where he begin his career.  <br /> <br />Anyway long period, My most favorite picks off the album (asides \\"Through the Wire\\") are: Slow Jamz, We Don't Care, All Falls Down, Spaceship, Jesus Walks (My inspiration), Never Let Me Down, Breathe In Breathe Out, Get 'Em High, Family Business, and Last Call <br /> <br />The interludes are ok so I don't have to put 'em down. <br /> <br />I believe that he's gonna do alright on my list 'cause I hear he has another album coming out next year entitled \\"Late Registraton\\". Hope that'll be a good one. <br /> <br />As you know, this album has a lot of ol' school songs you can remember back in the day. From Marvin Gaye's \\"Distant Lover\\", Chaka Kahn's \\"Through the Fire\\", Luther Vandross \\"A House Is Not a Home\\", you name it. Cause it has the same style on Twista's album KAMIKAZE (Which ya'll gon' check out I hear he's good) But learn what I just said from the album and keep your eyes open and always put God first in your life 'cause he waiting him. <br /> <br />'Member this. Kanye once said on the song \\"Jesus Walks\\", (You can rap about anything except for Jesus/That means guns, sex, lies, videotapes/ but if I talk about God my record won't get played. Huh?!) <br /> <br />

B0001LJC2K|5.0|My friend lent me a burnt copy of this cd back in April of 2004. I listened to it all the way through and thought \\"Ok.. Not bad\\" but after listening ot it again, I feel deeply DEEPLY In love with the band and their songs. You have to let some of them grow on you, but once you do, you can't get enough of them. I have heard the album at least one hundred times since April and I consider myself a newly obsessed Muse fan member. Since Absolution, I have acquired Showbiz, their first album, Hulaballo, an album of theirs released in the UK (including Live tracks) and Origin of Symmetry. I love all their songs. People ocmpare them to radiohead, but it is unfair. They are ridiculously talented. So buy this cd. Right now. I promise you you will not regret it; I have yet to meet a person who does not like Muse.

B00007LTIC|5.0|Going For The One, the 8th studio album by Yes, was released after a three-year wait since the excellent Relayer (1974).  In those three years, every band member that appears on this album released solo material (even Alan White!).  This might explain the fact that three of the five song here are credited to one person, whereas earlier compositions were group efforts.  This album signaled a return to the more concise style of songwriting of the first four albums.  As Rick Wakeman said: \\"Yes were writing songs again.\\".  Still, there's a 15-minute epic, so this is still familiar ground to fans of \\"Gates of Delirium\\" and the like. <br /> <br />1) Going For The One (10/10).  This song will always divide fans into two camps.  The vocals are a little high-pitched and the music a little twee, but it's exactly this adventurous spirit that makes Yes Yes.  Steve Howe's slide guitar solo is absolutely orgasmic and Chris Squire's backing vocals are GENIUS!  Get the fantastic \\"Yesyears\\" DVD to see studio footage of this master at work with the backing vox. <br />2) Turn of the Century (10/10)  A religious experience to say the least!  No drums intruding on the hallowed melody.  The instrumental section led by Wakeman's classical piano and Howe's wailing guitar is a taste of what's to come... <br />3) Parallels (10/10) A Chris Squire-penned chugging rocker featuring the best use of church organ ever.  Alan White has some opportunity to show off towards the end as well. <br />4) Wondrous Stories (9/10).  Jon Anderson's hippy strum-along and surprise hit single.  Altogether well-executed and memorable.  Also features the tacky keyboard sound Wakeman would employ on Tormato the following year. <br />5) Awaken (10/10).  Possibly the greatest Yes piece ever.  Starts off with a gorgeous piano flourish and Jon Anderson's dulcet tones.  Then comes the awesome, tricky time-signature and chanting.  Features an ethereal harp and organ section. <br /> <br />This is the greatest Yes album ofthe 70's.  They would reach another peak in 1984 with 90125 (if you don't think \\"Leave It\\" is genius...), but this album represent everything great about Yes. <br /> <br />Like this? Try these: <br />1) Yes - Tormato (but listen to it first) <br />2) Genesis - Wind & Wuthering (epic, odd time-signatures and a minor hit) <br /> <br /> <br />
0525457585|5.0|Dear Michael Ende, <br /> <br />Since I was a child, the video's made of your classic book had always been the building block of every dream and fantasy I had. I remember sitting home at the age of Six in front of my TV, captured by The Neverending Story. Now, as a teenager, I have read the actual book, and I fully appreciate the movie for its gifts to me as a child, but in all truthfulness, the book itself it's simply a piece of art, which in no way can ever be captured in film; to me it is a gateway to one's own imagination, and you just provide the storyline for the reader. <br /> <br />When I read your book for the first time, I did not set it down once. I read the full 445 pages from start to end hanging on every last word. There are so many aspects of life which I find utterly boring, and most of the time I find most books quite plain. But to me, your \\"creation\\" or \\"masterpiece\\" which I consider quite amazing, seems to literally be a book written from the dreams of children, stories we had not heart of yet in nursery rhymes, or old folk tales long forgotten. I felt as if I were in every scene in the story, living the adventure as if it were my own.  Your main character's Bastian and Atreyu seemed to make up the person I was. Bastian being a shy, timid boy, and Atreyu being a strong, confident worrier. I felt a connection with both of the characters, which helped me relate to your book much more and the choices the characters made during their adventures. <br /> <br /> As a child, I did not have many friends. No siblings, and no neighbors to play with; watching your movies and reading your book was a way for me to get to have my own adventures as a child. I did not have imaginary friends, but I did imagine myself quite often as if I were in your stories, how the people would talk to me, different things I would do. For example, I would love to get to sit down and talk to some of the characters, asking them about their lives, and where they had been. <br /> <br/>There were many times in the story you started to trail off into side stories, but ended them by saying \\"But that is another story and will be told another time\\". You only wrote one book, so was that you way of giving the reader his or her own power of imagination to think of what the story could possibly be? Or were you planning on writing a sequel to the story, and never got the time? <br /> <br />Out of curiosity of your life, I read your biography. Wondering perhaps, were you an only child, whose dreams and fantasies later ended up on the pages of The Neverending Story? Because it is not everyday that the ordinary person creates such an abstract story as the one you wrote. Come to find, you were an only child growing up in Germany during the Holocaust, with parents who did not get along. At times I feel as if I dislike my own family life, but to think of yours and how you must have dealt with things makes me appreciate the love my family has. I can imagine you sitting at home, playing with your toys thinking of adventures inside your head, which you're ultimately never forgot. The Neverending Story must have been a long growing story within your mind, which had accumulated bits and parts through your life. As a child, you were said to have many pets, which you're later had play main parts in your book. Also, you were said to be fascinated with the Dr.Doolittle books; was that the inspiration you had to create your story and characters? It quite surprised me to realize that many of the scenes and characters within your book have a deeper connection than just fantasy to you. One of the main characters, Bastian, was actually portrayed from a childhood friend of yours who died? Was the fact that you loved horseback riding was possibly a key to why Atreyu was a skilled horseback rider? There are many questions I have had in my mind about your story since I was a child. They are endless in my mind, but the one that never ends (no pun intended) is how one person cancreate such a vivid story within their own mind, and somehow put in into words powerful enough for others to see what you saw. <br /> <br /> Even today at the age of Sixteen, I wish with my full heart that if even in a dream, somehow, I could experience the adventure your created. To ride on the back of Falkor, to sit with the children in Silver City, or to lie at night and count the stars in the forest of Perlin. All this may seem very childish and young, but to me the story is still as real as it was when I was six years old. I am still captivated by every detail of your story, and there are still many aspects of it, which I have yet to understand fully.  <br /> I have heard of you being called a philosopher in the past. Much like how Einstein or Franklin were men deeply compassionate with science and society, you were in a sense the \\"philosopher\\" of the imagination and mind. Some may just view you as a children's book author, but I believe only the unimaginative would say that. It is very hard for me to see how anyone could possibly not agree with the fact that The Neverending Story is a literary masterpiece. It seems to engulf the whole view of childhood fantasy in one, and can bring out the child in anyone who sits down to read it. <br /> <br /> Looking back, when I was younger you story kept me company when I did not have friends to spend my time with. I was consumed with the plot, the storyline, the characters, and every detail you put into it. Ten years later, although I am it seems a different person, it keeps the same connection with me as it did ten years ago. I am still captivated by the beauty and imagery in every page you wrote. The most magnificent part of your book was in Chapter XIII when you described Perlin, The Night Forest. \\"Soon the velvety darkness all around Bastian and Moon Child, over and under them on every side, was filled with rapidly growing luminous plants. A globe of radiant colors, a new luminous world hovered in the Nowhere, and grew and grew. And its innermost center Bastian and Moon Child sat hand in hand, looking around them with their eyes of wonder.\\" This small piece of work only shows a tiny example of your gift.  Passages like these fill my mind with colors and images so vivid even I forget where I am, and at times I even feel like I have \\"fallen\\" into the book, and am experiencing it all first hand. <br /> <br /> You may never comprehend the extent of that of The Neverending Story. I wish it were a book every child was made to read. I personally have lost count at how many times I have read your book. That doesn't seem surprising to me though, for my copy of the book is literally falling apart. Yet, on a rainy day at home, instead of reaching for my brand new hard cover books, I always pick up my warn, tattered copy of The Neverending Story, because no matter how many times I read it, it always seem to have more stories and new adventures every time I do. So in a sense, to me, and hopefully others, your book is in fact, The Neverending Story. <br /> <br />Sincerely and with Much Love, <br /> <br />Cassie  <br /> <br />e-mail: geminifemmeqt@aol.com

EVEN THE HALLOWEEN SERIES WAS MORE SCAREY!  <br />AND TO SAY THIS MOVIE WAS GORY AND SADISTIC. YEAH IT WAS CREEPY BUT ONLY FOR A SECOND. THE PARENTS THAT WENT ON THAT STRANGE KILLING SPREE I MEAN REALLY. HUGE JOKE! I'M SOO MAD I STAYED UP WATCHING THIS.. LET ALONE PAID MONEY FOR IT. DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME REALLY.  WISH I DIDN'T. AND I'M A HUGE HORROR MOVIE FAN.. I EVEN THINK FRIDAY THE 13TH JASON X WAS A BETTER MOVIE HAHA... I REALLY MEAN THAT!
068987474X|5.0|Hey all ... this is a wake-up call to millions of women, like me, who have made excuse after excuse after excuse after (well, you get the idea) for why it is that guys who showed real interest in us were actually not that interested after all.  I have read \\"The Rules\\", I have read \\"Forget About The Rules\\" (or whatever it's called), I have read \\"Why Men Love Bitches\\" (and I personally think they don't, 'cos nobody likes bitches, that's why they're called bitches), and this book is the first one I read that actually sounded HONEST, not like the authors were trying to put me on, but giving me the kind of helpful \\"wake up and smell the coffee, you go on girl and don't waste 'yer time with someone who ain't worth your Jimmy Choos/Birkenstocks/jewelry clad bare feet\\" talk I appreciate.  Not only that, but it's funny, truly funny in spots.  I like true and funny together.  If you do too, splurge for this book.  I read it in one night and felt so dang empowered I actually went and moved all of the furniture in my bedroom (including a fully stocked bookshelf and a bureau full of clothes) around the next day, because honey buns, am I waiting on Mssr. Parfait to do it?  Uh-huh.  We don't need to be Paris Hilton or even Tina Fey (and there is a legitimate argument to be made that Ms. Fey is far more attractive than the smirking, peroxided, twig-like semblance of humanity that is the aforementioned heiress whose fifteen minutes of fame were up something like six months ago) to recognize and attract good guys.  Or, as interesting and more importantly, to throw back the ones who are going to treat us anything less than decently.  Sure, if you put flypaper out there there'll be flies, but this book actually persuaded me that a butterfly might also happen by, and when he does, I can get much, much better at recognizing the butterfly (who isn't just a pretty moth but the real thing -- a guy who has metamorphosed from just a guy to a good, real man). It really isn't that difficult, once you boil it down.  Wahoo for that!  Wahoo for getting to the point!  Oh, and one more thing -- I think Madonna pretty much summed this one up with her \\"Respect Yourself\\" years ago.  Madonna -- a subject for another lil' essay entirely, as she rewrote the book for modern gals on how to be you and sexy if-ya-wanna-be and nobody's fool.  There, that's my story and I'm sticking to it.  To quote Greg, \\"don't waste the pretty.\\"  Dang skippy.ce you boil it down.  Wahoo for that!  Wahoo for getting to the point!  Oh, and one more thing -- I think Madonna pretty much summed this one up with her \\"Respect Yourself\\" years ago.

B00005JMUA|5.0|I'm not going to give any spoilers here, so I'll keep this nice and vauge - but around the last twenty minutes of Kill Bill, Volume Two I realized that QT had made his version of a chick flick.<br /><br />On the most obvious level, of course, this is a very violent and visceral film. It's full of the same mix of innovative brutality and crazy humor that marks QT's standout scenes. Look past that, though, and you'll see that motivation behind all the events in the film is uniquely female. The story and character came from a collaboration with Uma Thurman, and we don't know who came up with what. No matter, though - this movie will repulse you, scare you, make you laugh, might make you cry, and will make you like and understand both the hero (Thurman as the Bride) and the villian (an amazingly charming David Carradine as Bill.)<br /><br />This is why, I think, that Tarantino's films resonate so much - they work on a number of diffent levels, and that gives them a richness and depth that isn't obvious at first viewing. Pulp Fiction is really about the consequences of not following God. Kill Bill is about the difference between men and women.
6305075492|2.0|Before beginning to write this review I read a couple of the previous reviews, and one person said something that summed up my thoughts quite well. You Tim Burton fans will see stuff here that was obviously a large influence on him. Specifically, the sets. You can imagine movie-goers of that era feeling as if they were seeing an alternate world as they watched this movie.<br /><br />I think my thoughts on this movie will differ from those of most of the reviewers, though. I think the sets and the look of the characters are the most interesting things about this movie. Is it actually from 1921, though? On the VHS I have, it says \\"released in 1919\\" right on the box. Beyond that, the camerawork and production values seem to be quite a bit less than the those of many other films from the early '20s.<br /><br />This movie has its moments, but if you really want to see a movie from the early '20s that is psychotic and strange even by many of today's standards, try Haxan, from 1922. For those of you who think Dr. Caligari or the flying monkeys scene from Wizard of Oz are creepy or scary, you will be utterly horrified by Haxan. Haxan is a movie that couldn't have been made by American studios until probably the late '60s... and lots of people still would have been outraged even then, I'm sure.<br /><br />Haxan has better cinematography and production values, and every aspect of it is more twisted and evil than anything in Caligari. Plus the acting is alot better. Caligari is worthy as an historical artifact and for its influence, but Haxan is better in every single way. There are things in Caligari that are laughably bad or just boring. Haxan is a twisted masterpiece of evil and perversion, and worthy of many more viewings.<br /><br />Having said this, if you are really into Dr. Caligari, Mark Dresser (incredible bassist, improvisor, composer) released a music cd of the same name. His The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari is available on this website in the music section.<br />  <br />
0767817486|5.0|Jeff Shannon's review is nonsense. He accuses \\"Midnight Express\\" of being manipulative. What does he think film making is? Films--and art in general--are nothing more than manipulation in order to achieve a desired effect, whether to scare us, make us cry, or make us laugh. It's all about manipulation. I read Billy Hayes original book accounting his true life experiences in Turkey; overall, the film holds true to the autobiography, although it shies away from Hayes's own self-professed positive homosexual experiences while in prison. I suppose audiences in 1978 wouldn't be able to handle that. In the film, Hayes is shown as rejecting any kind of homosexual advance, although he does so kindly. Regardless, the film is powerful and has visually stunning cinematography, something that is lacking in today's films. This is one of those films you show friends who have never seen it or heard of it. Almost all will come away awestruck. It is a remarkable film achievement. It's one of the top films of the 1970s--and in the decade of \\"The Deer Hunter,\\" \\"Jaws,\\" \\"Star Wars,\\" \\"The Exorcist,\\" and \\"The Godfather,\\" just to name a few, that's saying a lot!
B000002GGU|5.0|I have all of Brayn Adams albums (apart from his first two) and I can safely say that this one is definately his rockiest, catchiest and his best one. Every song is basically a hit. This album is the best one to get if you're starting a BA collection. <br />The songs: <br /> <br />1. One night love affair - This is a fairly catchy song. It isn't hard and rock, but it's fun to sing, but it gets boring after a while. 9/10 <br />2. She's only happy when she's dancing - This is really fun and catchy. It's faster than \\"One night...\\" and it's definately better. 9/10 <br />3. Run to you - One of his bigger hits from the album. The guitar playing is very dark. Again, it's catchy but not as hard and after  loads of listens it gets kinda boring. 9/10 <br />4. Heaven - The only slow song on the album, but it's one of my favourites. Good piano, with cool lead guitar in the background and a sweet solo. Slow, but catchy. 10/10 <br />5. Somebody - This is another favourite. You can really feel the 80s sond in it. 10/10 <br />6. Summer of 69 - By far the best song on the album. Everyone in my family loves and why shouldn't they? Really catchy and just completely fun. The lyrics are easy to remember. 10+/10 <br />7. Kids wanna rock - The hardest song on the album. Really enjoyable to listen to. A real air guitar song. 10/10 <br />8. It's only love - This is my least favourite on the album, but that's only because Tina Turner sings the most of it. It's a catchy song, but I'd prefer Bryan to sing the most of it, but he does good guitar in it. 8/10 <br />9. Long gone - Good opening riff. This is kinda hard too. Sounds brilliant load. But, not the best track. 8.5/10 <br />10. Ain't goanna cry - The most underrated song on the album. I love this track, but most people I know hate it. It's hard again, but it's really fun. Great riffs, lots of shouting. A great way to end the album. 10/10 <br /> <br />If you love other 80s people like Bon Jovi, Springsteen, and... all those other rokers then get this. You will love it!
B0002S94OS|4.0|i'd say this album is definitely worth the money you'll pay for it (unless you buy it at hot topic which probably charge $20).  i would give it 5 stars but i only have one problem with it:  they didn't really progress much from as the palaces burn.  although i really loved atpb, i was hoping for something more different.  and it doesn't quite have that raw feel to it any more.  however, this is a good album.  style or not, this is a great album.  the timing and stops and everything sounds absolutely WONDERFUL.  its amazing.  standout tracks are:  laid to rest, now you've got something to die for, the faded line, omerta, break you, ashes of the wake, remorse is for the dead.  all the others are good, though.  except for track 9.  that is the only song i actually don't like.  but it is definitely worth your money.  get it.
B000002LGW|4.0|I avoided this cd for years despite being a big DM fan, not seeing the merit in live albums. It wasn't till I heard the live tracks on the SOFD singles and had some extra cash to blow that I realized this album could be good and picked it up. It was well worth it. <br /> <br />I think one of the most notable things about DM's live recordings is hearing the way the songs are rearanged live. For most bands, live albums are not really new material. For DM, it's almost like buying a cd of remixes. There are small changes and varations in the songs all over the place. In Behind the Wheel, the crowd's clapping becomes a part of the percussion line. Stranglove's drums pound much harder than any studio mixes, and the keyboard sounds used are distinctly different. The live versions of Never Let Me Down again and Stripped combine the aspects of both the album mixes and the various remixes (Aggro, Split-mix, and Highland mix)into one long \\"ultimate\\" mix of each song. <br /> <br />I think the live cut that stands out the most in this respect is People are People. There is a new intro that seems to go on for 1 or 2 minutes before the main body of the song starts, updating the 1983 song with the kind of emphasis on guitar and synthesized vocal chorus which DM had used on their later album Music for the Masses. It's so good I find myself almost enjoying the intro more than the actual song itself. <br /> <br />Vocally, DM's live performances tend to be unique as well. Dave Gahan interprets the songs a bit, deciding to sustain certain words longer. Sometimes Dave will shorten a line and Martin Gore's voice will emerge more prominently from the background. Most notably, absent from any studio recordings, Alan Wilder's voice is added to the mix on certain songs. For example,in Question of Lust and Things You Said, obviously Martin can't sing 2 lines at once, so Alan sings lines like \\"do you know what I mean?\\" and \\"I never tried to hide them\\" instead. In songs like Black Celebration and Everything Counts, Dave, Martin, and Alan all sing simultanouesly, creating harmonies not present in the studio mixes. <br /> <br />Besides all this, I think the track list on the whole is a better compilation of DM's best songs from this period than what you get on albums like the Singles 86-98 or Catching up with Depeche Mode. Primarily, this album has some of the best songs not released as singles, whereas other compilations focus exclusively on singles. I think most would agree that many singles from DM's very early albums are worth sacrificing for album tracks of DM's later work, and that's what they did in 101. My only complaint would be that there's not 1 song from Broken Frame on 101, and atleast just having \\"See You\\" would have been nice. <br /> <br />101 is worth a purchase if you allready have all the DM albums. Besides being a good mix of tracks from throughtout the years, it  provides an updated, slightly remixed sound to all the songs, and the band's live vocals are sometimes superior to their studio recordings. The audience reaction also adds a lot to some songs; having the audience of 75,000 people continue singing Everything Counts alone for almost a minute after DM stoped playing is an impressive and classic moment.
B00004ZDVQ|5.0|in late 1981,the brilliant stevie wonder released the sparkling,crystal,shinning,hard driving explosive lovesong of his career:'THAT GIRL'/this lovejam just blew me away the first time that i heard it as a 17 year old back in the late fall of 1981.i immediately bought the single because it is so powerful.stevie is essentially a oneman band in this killer jam.he played the drums,harmonica,fender rhodes,piano,synthesizers and of course his amazing legendary voice.the classic 1981 THAT GIRL track a cut that describes wonder's hot desire 4 a woman that every man wants because her love is so full of rapture and sensuality.in the song,wonder wonder desires her intensely with passionate lyrics:that girl thinks that she's so fine/that soon she'll have my mind/that girl thinks that she's so smart/that soon she'll have my heart/she thinks in no time flat/she'll be free and clear to start/with her emotional rescue of love that you'll leave torn apart....midway thru this jam, wonder desires her even more:before i tell her that i love her/that i want her/that my mind,soul and body needs her/in that i want to that i need to doall that i have to be in her love.....i've been hurting for a long time/and you've been playing for a long time/you know it's true/you've been holding for a long time/and you've been running for a long time/it's time to do for what we have to do....that girl,that girl.....stevie's incredible sparkling harmonica solo and hard driving drum beat enhances the song into a legendary legacy that is of stevie wonder.<br /><br />after hearing 'that girl' as the lead off 1981 single from the forthcoming album entitled 'stevie wonder's original musiquarium I' i couldn't wait 2 hear the next new songs from this greatest hits retrospective that focuses on phase two of his remarkable career from 1972-1982 when wonder took control of artistic freedom of his career in 1971 after the release of his criminally ignored 1971 classic album entitled 'where i'm coming from' which was wonder's first true artistic statement concept album that motown could not deal with because of it's strong social and political content.my sweet mother bought me 'stevie wonder's original musiquarium I' album in the summer of 1982 4 me while i was still in my teens.i was happy that the album was a greatest hits of his 2nd 'new era' phase of his career.just months after this double album was released,stevie was on tour with other r&b legends at the budweiser superfest in the summer of 1982 when i saw him live in concert.i also bought a rare poster print of stevie at this concert of which stevie had his thumbprint and also,he had handwritten his first real name 'stevland' right next to his thumbprint on this 1982 poster print.<br /><br />'stevie wonder's original musiquaruim I'is a classic double album of material from his seventies to early eighties glory,a snapshot of sparkling highlights from 1972-1980 from the albums 'music of my mind'/'talking book'/'innervisions'/'fulfillingness'first finale'/'songs in the key of life'/'stevie wonder's journey through the secret life of plants'/'hotter than july' which was then glossed over with 4 new songs:'front line'(1982)/'ribbon in the sky'(1982)/'that girl'(1981)/'do i do'(1982)....wonder craftedly chose his selections with patience and care and gave us we as fans something extra including the 4 new songs of soon 2 be wonder classics.when i listened 2 this album,it was legend on how wonder had each new song on the original album/lp/vinyl release as the last cut on the original double vinyl album.the way stevie compiled the album is genius which still makes it a true concept album.and it is also genius on how wonder stringed this classic compilation together of which the songs flow together and how they blend into one another non-stop,because there is no silence between the tracks-they flow into one another perfectly.<br /><br />side one of the original double album release has wonder's hard cutting edge message songssuch as 'superstition'/'you haven't done nothing'/'living for the city' and the then new all out hardrock funk classic 'front line' in which wonder delivers an angry vocal about seeing himself as a young blackman who joins the united states army back in 1964 who fights 4 america,comes home after the war parading his purple heart amongst his black brothers back in the 'hood as they inform him 2 quit bragging 'bout the war that he'd been in and in the process,he finds no justice at home as a blackman in america after the vietnam atrocity as wonder details harshly:they had me standing on the front line,they had me standing on the front line/but now i stand at the back of the line when it comes to gettin'ahead...they gave me a uniform and a tiny salty pill/to stop the big urge i might have for the wrong kind of thrill/they put a gun in my hand and said,''shoot until he's dead!''/brought up in church taught no man should take another's life/but then put in a jungle where life has no price...back in the world the paper reads today another war is in the brewing/but what about the lives of yesterday/and the many happy families that have been ruined/i walk the neighborhood parading my purple heart/with a fear of agent orange that no one will stop!!!....<br /><br />the song is wonder's harsh indictment of america's hypocrisy of having the blackman fight in a useless senseless war of either being killed or disabled and then the blackman has 2 endure another fight 2 get justice at home in america when returning from vietnam.'front line'is another one of those classic wonder songs that is ignored.i rank it near the top as one of wonder's greatest funkrock blasting achievements.stevie's killer synthesizer solo on 'front line' rivals any killer guitarist's solo on record.stevie's killer synthesizer solo on 'front line' is simply put one of the baddest killer solo synthesizer attacks in music.i always turn the volume up on this 'front line' funk cut when wonder blasts his synthesizer solo at the song's hardfunkrock conclusion.<br /><br />romance is the theme of side two from the original lp release,which features a sample of wonder's classic seventies lovesongs such as 'superwoman(where were you when i needed you)'/'send one your love'/'you are the sunshine of my life'and the then new loveballad 'ribbon in the sky'/'ribbon in the sky'the beautiful loveballad which features wonder's beautiful jazz piano playing and classic vocals with an opening hypnotic love chorus that sets the tone of romantic love:oh so long for this night i prayed/that a star would guide you my way/to share with me this special day/where a ribbon's in the sky for our love...and then there's that beautiful video that accompanies the song,which begins in a quiet peaceful setting inside of a house with calm winds blowing the curtains as sunlight frames the mood with wonder cool breezing at the piano.other images of the video shows wonder on a cruise ship letting fly a ribbon from his hand 2 a pretty ebony ballerina lady who is doing beautiful graceful ballerina dance moves amongst a backdrop of beautiful dark moving clouds and sparkling sunlight as she dances with grace,beauty and elegance as she is the ribbon of stevie's heart in the video.<br /><br />side three from the original album vinyl release has three uptempo numbers from wonder's seventies period such as 'higher ground'/'sir duke'/'boogie on reggae woman'and one of his early eighties uptempo numbers 'master

0920668372|1.0|I've read many of the other reviews and I am shocked at the positive comments.  The first time I read this to my son it creeped me out.  The idea of the mother sneaking into her grown son's house at night...through a window!  The illustration of the car with the ladder on top driving over in the middle of the night.  If she hadn't crawled around the floor, or maybe if she sang the song to her grown son while she was just over visiting, or maybe if she just stroked his hair rather than picking him up bodily.  I'm all for unconditional love...but yikes.  This is going into the trash.
B0000CDL93|5.0|Its undeniably a conspiracy, face it our governement doesnt work, and has Costner states in this movie maybe we should change it.  This film says it all, and even though it is quite long it keeps you interested all the way through and never gets boring.  This is bursting with facts and shocking truths, and is more suspensful then any thriller out there.  The performances are also notably good, and even though Costner is an avergae actor at best, he impressed me with this, and actually had me tearing at the end, because he spoke the truth.  Its powerful, well crafted, very well directed, well acted, all around great film making.  Its not for the weak of heart because you see JFK get shot in the head numerous times and see very clearly what actually happened.  JFK was a good president and if he wasnt assassinated would have done many more great things for america, like stop the vietnam war (My father is a vietnam veteran, and he deserves better then what that idiot Bush is doin for him right now).  This is Stones best film so far, but i think Alexander is probably gonna be better since he has been working on it for years, and Stone is a great director.  I highly recommend seeing this film and Fareinghit 9/11 (sorry if i spelled it wrong) if you have a brain and truly want to understand how screwed up our government is.  10 out of a 10.
B000022TSW|5.0|If you are a dessicated prude, afraid to laugh at anything remotely naughty because you think Jesus will stop loving you if you do... don't watch this movie.  Also, please kill yourself so we don't have to read your imbecillic movie reviews. <br /> <br />Ahem. <br /> <br />For the rest of you, \\"South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut\\" is a bigger, crazier and more profane version of the TV show.  OK, maybe not as demented as the one where Cartman gets his revenge on somebody by MAKING THE GUY'S PARENTS INTO CHILI.  But still insane by any normal movie plot standards.  It is also very funny, one of the handfull of comedic movies in the past 10 years that was genuinely funny and original.
B0002OERI0|5.0|(...) I personally have to say that Green Day are evolving.    Admit it, many of the old bands from the 80's and 90's are just getting older, and their music is just maturing.  Red Hot Chili Peppers have a less punk to it, same with Incubus.  With that said:    DON'T EVER COMPARE GREEN DAY TO BRITTANY SPEARS OR HILLARY DUFF, its just wrong!  The CD has content and meaning within it.  It is all connected, which makes it have an \\"Abbey Road\\" feel to it.  The idea that \\"Jesus of Surburbia\\" has parts connected in it, makes the music worth listening to.    I do hear a little Avril, a little Good Charlotte, but guess what??   Avril and Charlotte would never be on the music scene if it wasn't for Green Day.  For some that say that Green Day are just copycats, they aren't.  We should all respect their viewpoints, and love music.    My personal favorites are \\"Boulevard of Broken Dreams\\".  It contains a weird guitar opener, which makes you want to listen for more.  \\"Wake Me Up when September Ends\\" provides a Sept 11th feel to it, plus it contains such a softer but heavy sound to it.      Overall, the music is softer, but the CD was organized and constructed quite well.  Meaning and true content adds my 5 stars to the band.  Rock on Green Day, and keep up with what you are doing!
0312319517|2.0|AVENGER is a let-down compared to other Forsyth works. The cast of characters is large, and many of them are obviously there simply to advance the plot. Yet Forsyth gives paragraphs and sometimes pages of background information on these characters. The effect is like enduring the phony pleasantries of a salesman who is chatting you up before the pitch. Secondly, the success of the hero depends on the \\"bad guys\\" making a series of stupid mistakes, to the point that it becomes difficult to suspend disbelief. Thirdly, even as far as action adventures go, this one is lacking because the hero has almost no downturns or setbacks against which he must struggle. Even an episode of \\"Scooby Doo\\" has more plot twists. Finally, Forsyth frequently employs a prissy sort of writing style, using euphemisms and phrases in quotation marks when a direct statement would be more approriate.  The overall effect is smarmy, outdated and predictable, like a Roger Moore-era James Bond flick.
B000066NW0|5.0|Avril Lavigne is a born rebel with a unique sense of personality and style. Her album, Let Go, is basically pop.  <br /> <br />1.) \\"Losing Grip\\"=8/10~This song is a dark and catchy opener. I once heard that this is Avril's favorite track on the C.D., and I can see why.  <br /> <br />2.) \\"Complicated\\"=9/10~When I first heard of Avril Lavigne, this was the song that was playing.  <br /> <br />3.) \\"Sk8er Boi\\"=11/10~This is the best track on the entire record.  <br /> <br />4.) \\"I'm With You\\"=9/10~It has a nice storyline to it.  <br /> <br />5.) \\"Mobile\\"=8/10~To me, this song seems to be one of the fillers, but I like it anyway.  <br /> <br />6.) \\"Unwanted\\"=10/10~This is quite an edgy song about a relationship gone wrong. I love it!  <br /> <br />7.) \\"Tomorrow\\"=10/10~It is nice to see Avril sensitive every once in awhile.  <br /> <br />8.) \\"Anything But Ordinary\\"=10/10~That you are, Avril; that you are...:)  <br /> <br />9.) \\"Things I'll Never Say\\"=10/10~This is a nice and cute, lil' love-song from the antagonized \\"sk8er-gurl\\": Priceless.  <br /> <br />10.) \\"My World\\"=9/10~A nice visual of an average life in the small-town of Napanee, Ontario. I especially like the part when she says that she got fired by \\"fried-chicken ass.\\" (Tee-hee!)  <br /> <br />11.) \\"Nobody's Fool\\"=9/10~Avril is an AWESOME rapper, and I think she should do it more often.  <br /> <br />12.) \\"Too Much To Ask\\"=8/10~Avril sounds kinda' \\"country-ish\\" in this song.  <br /> <br />13.) \\"Naked\\"=10/10~This is a nice way to end the album...One of my favorite songs...  <br /> <br />All in all, this CD is FANTASTIC!!! And trust me, it is definitely worth your money. <br /> <br />
B00005JKGZ|5.0|This is indeed a merry little movie! Judy Garland, Margaret O' Brien, Leon Ames, Mary Astor and Tom Drake. What else do you want? Meet Me In St. Lois was actually really famous for it's score and wonderful songs such as: Meet Me In ST. Lois, The Boy Next Door, The Trolley Song, Have yourself a Merry Little Christmas... This movies plot is based around the Smith's family moving to New York. No one wants to except for the somewhat selfish dad (Leon Ames. Oh, such glorious days where people DERESSED to go to the wonderful World's Fair
B00005JNEI|5.0|I thought Michael Moore did an excellent job with this documentary. He shows you the facts right there on paper and video....there's no faking what is shown here...it is the truth! How disgraceful that our president could mislead and manipulate the American people the way he did. And how everything Bush Sr. and Bush Jr. have done is all for their greed of money and Iraqi oil, not to mention the billions of dollars in business deals the Bush's have with Saudi investors in America. Oh and lets not forget the longterm business relationship between the Bush's and the BinLaden families (which is why the BinLaden families were the only people allowed to fly out of the US only two days after Sept.11th) Bush has to protect his investors...the hell with questioning the families about Osama and his whereabouts...their money is more important to Bush. Whether you're a Democrat or Republican this documentary is a must to see. And by the way when Bush and Cheney testified at the 9/11 hearings they would only do so if they weren't put under oath...gee you think they told the whole truth and nothing but the truth! Hah! Hah!
B0000A98ZP|5.0|This movie has so many great quotes, they'd be impossible to list them all, and isn't that always the mark of a classic? The Breakfast Club is a movie about high school, teen stereotypes and finding friendship in unexpected places. The movie has sex, drugs and a little bit of rock and roll, but it still comes out with a message at the end, expressed so aptly by its opening song \\"Don't you Forget About Me.\\"     The moves shows five teens on a day of Saturday detention. Claire, the rich, popular, prom queen \\"princess\\" played by Molly Ringwold, Andy, the also popular varsity wrestler \\"Jock\\"(Emilio Estevez), Allison (Ally Sheedy), the sullen, quiet, strange \\"basket case\\", Brian (Anthony Michael Hall), the quintessential nerdy \\"brain\\", and John Bender (Judd Nelson), a rowdy, rough edged, devil may care criminal. All of these diverse characters are put together in Saturday detention, and they see each other in terms ofthese stereotypes, just as the principal sees them. Their interactions reflect the reality of most high schools, the beauty queens certainly dont interact with the nerds and the loners, and no jock is going to be caught dating a \\"basket case\\", or is he?     However, when the teens are asked to write  1,000 word essay about who they are, the kids start to see these stereotypes for what they are. As the movie progresses, the teens discover that they have a lot more in common than they thought, and eventually overcome their differences, at least for a day and become frineds, but will the frinedship last on monday morning when the peer pressure comes in? it's left up to your imagination to figure out, but the Saturday we spend with the kids from Shermer, Illinois is one where we learn a lot about ourselves and see something we can all relate to, but don't often voice.      The movie is fantastic, but the DVD leaves much to be desired. There is no director's commentary, nor deleted scenes and special features. All you get are textual bios of the cast, and other unremarkable things. As a big fan of the movie, i was hoping to see at least commentary by john hughes and some deleted scenes. No such luck!
B00004Y6RO|5.0|Even though I got Iowa (2001, way heavier, so i was expecting a lot more) first, this cd ruled! it had a mix of every kinda metal in there. if you are contemplating whether or not to buy the normal cd, or the digipack, BUY THE DIGIPACK! it has 6 more songs and they are all unreleased. <br /> <br />All in All, buy this cd NOW!
B0001UL7RY|5.0|. Take Me Away &#62;&#62; 9/10 &#62;&#62; A rock song.  <br />2. Together &#62;&#62;10/10 &#62;&#62; One of the best songs on the album.  <br />3. Don't Tell Me &#62;&#62; 8/10 &#62;&#62; It's a good song if you don't have the CD. But when you compare it to the other songs it sounds a bit weak.  <br />4. He Wasn't &#62;&#62; 10/10 &#62;&#62; My favorite track.  <br />5. How Does It Feel? &#62;&#62; 9/10 &#62;&#62; A nice ballad.  <br />6. My Happy Ending &#62;&#62; 9/10 &#62;&#62; This is a really good song with an intersting chorus.  <br />7. Nobody's Home &#62;&#62; 9/10 &#62;&#62; Another slow-ish song.  <br />8. Forgotten &#62;&#62; 10/10 &#62;&#62; Best song on the album. The riffs in this song are...amazing, vocals too.  <br />9. Who Knows &#62;&#62; 9/10 &#62;&#62; It's a great song.  <br />10. Fall to Pieces &#62;&#62; 8/10 &#62;&#62; It's a great song, but something's missing.  <br />11. Freak Out &#62;&#62; 10/10 &#62;&#62; My second favorite song on the album, about being free, letting go, and standing up for yourself.  <br />12. Slipped Away &#62;&#62; 9/10 &#62;&#62; About the death of her grandfather, the best ballad on the album.  <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
B00006G8O1|4.0|I stopped watching Hollywood movies a good while back, with the occasional exception, and this, though not Hollywoodian, was refreshing. I'm not sure why it took me so long to view it. <br />The Giant bunny man seriously had me scared and speculating throughout the movie and the fact that I truly couldn't make an easy prediction about how the storyline would unfold made it a big plus for me. You can do your own analysis, think out your own theory and it will be good in a sense. It's not so complex that it completely blows you away and leaves you dumbfounded, but has enough for an evening of plot analysis amongst friends. <br />I'm also happy I had no idea who Jake Gyllenhaal was, as in general, any often asked actor or actress that isn't less than brilliant still fails to come across as the character they portray. (I still see the 'moviestar' no matter what) <br />The expression that seems carved in Donnie's face is something worth alone to watch the movie for in my humble opinion. <br />As most people around here seem to be Americans, may I drop in some European films for you to view and form an opinion on? Most are worth it, and in general not 'regular'. Alas, personal taste differs ne.

0312330529|4.0|Wow! What a story Mr. Roberts tells, based on his life as an escaped convict from max. security prison in Australia, posing as a doctor/healer in the slums of Mumbai, dealing drugs and then other illicit trades, fighting alongside the mujaheddin in Afghanistan in the 1980's, and joining the Mumbai mafia. Each step of the way, he has words of wisdom and redemption. However, he and his editor have overindulged his tendency to ramble a bit. This book was over 900 pp, but I still stayed up day and night reading it until I finished it. Bravo, Mr. Roberts!
0812550706|5.0|This book is probably one of my favorites ever.  It came highly recommanded from a friend.  If you love science fiction this is your book.  I am thirteen years old and loved it and my father read it and he loved it.  Also a great series though none as good as this one.  I am probably going to buy it for my birthday even though I have read it.  Five Stars!!!!!!!
B0002WYS6S|5.0|Un grandioso DVD del cual nos podemos dar cuenta que Dream Theater es una banda que lleva el virtuosismo al los extremos, este es uno de los mejores DVD que estn en mi coleccin, la produccin es excelente, el video y la calidad de sonido es una de las mejores en este tipo de msica, las ejecuciones de cada uno de los integrantes de la banda es majestuosa y es de mencionar que realmente Mr. Petrucci es uno de los mejores guitarristas del mundo sin ninguna duda, algo que llama mucho la atencin es que a este se le nota un gran cansancio.  <br /> <br />La seleccin de temas es perfecta, vale la pena decir que los momentos mas sublimes son en Beyond this Life donde creo que la cancin original dura alrededor de 6:30 pero aqu la hacen de 20 min. con un arreglo en el medio de la cancin excelente, donde podemos ver un mini duelo entre Portnoy y Rudess, luego una muy buena versin en guitarra elctrica de la balada Hollow Years, pero el momento cumbre es el Instrumedly, en el cual toman las secciones instrumentales de varias canciones de diferentes discos pero manteniendo de base The Dance of Eternity e incluyen adems 2 cortos de Liquid Tension Experiment, y mi favorita en este DVD a termino muy personal es Stream of Conciousness. <br /> <br />El Disco 2 incluye: 1) un video corto en el cual nos muestra las etapas y los diferentes discos de Dream Theater; 2) Drum Solo de Mike Portnoy (el cual no me gusto porque siento que no pasa de lo mismo.....Sorry Mike,), 3) Muestra del equipo de Petrucci y Rudess; 4) Documental acerca de la gira en Japn y  <br />5) Instrumedly en diferentes ngulos, en el cual podemos seleccionar entre el video original o solamente a Portnoy, o a Petrucci, o a Myung o a Rudess, el ngulo sobre este ultimo no es muy bueno porque la toma es desde la parte baja del escenario y solo se observa el y su teclado sin poder ver lo que toca. <br />Algo muy bueno es que la produccin del DVD decidi subtitularlo al Espaol y a 6 idiomas mas. <br /> <br />Ahora porque digo CASI PERFECTO (porque si fuera perfecto seria hasta mentira), el problema es que exactamente al minuto 1:00 en New Millennium el sistema 5.1 Surround se pierde, el speaker trasero derecho no se escucha mas y en el izquierdo se pierde la seal del teclado, concentrndose todo en los Speakers frontales y as continua hasta el final del concierto; despus de esta \\"pequea\\" inconveniencia Petrucci se escucha con un volumen mas bajo y da la sensacin que toda la banda a pasado a los Speakers izquierdos; en el 2.0 Stereo Sound no ocurre este problema. <br /> <br />Un DVD que a pesar de lo anterior continua con un buen sonido y una calidad de video fenomenal. TOTALMENTE RECOMENDADO.
0783114893|4.0|Watching Rutger Hauer in this made me think, \\"Europeans are scary!!\\"  It's a shame he didn't go on to make more cool movies.
B0002S94OS|3.0|i just got this cd today. it's good, but there's something about it that just isn't as good as palaces was. Randy doesnt sound like he's as passionate this time around, and the music could be a bit better. still good enough for 3 stars though
0876855575|5.0|This is Bukowski's masterpiece. It is vulgar, sad, funny, and compassionate. Not many writers can write a book like this. He does not exploit his terrible upbringing or less than \\"respectable\\" views on life (as he sometimes does in other books) but rather turns these facts into good literature. It's like punk rock on paper. The way he sees through the ridiculously fake nature of much of American life is truly inspirational. And his prose is, as usual, excellent.
B00030590I|5.0|I feel sorry for anyone who will be seeing this film for the first time on a DVD on low-end tv set as the screen will not do it justice: not in terms of the glorious cinematography, some great fight scenes and the evocative landscape.<br /><br />There are many reviews here that already talk about the plot of the film and so forth, so I mainly did this to give an opposing view on some points made by others, making it clear that I am a mere English speaker.<br /><br />One review says that the Miramax English sub-titles are terrible in general. I would hope that he/she is not comparing it to the meagre offering presented in the official Chinese release DVD, which I own. The Miramax sub-titles are an IMMENSE imrpovement as  they show a far firmer grasp on English idiom. The Chinese release sub-titles read like an ESL book: short, unimaginative and vague. The only time it shows any sort of superiority is near the end where \\"Our Land\\" turns out to be the more literal (and more accurate) \\"All Under Heaven\\"; and the closing sub-titles are much less cheesy and sentimental. However the Miramax sub-titles cannot be blamed for the fascist tones in the film: the plot and ending of the movie do that very well on their own. In addition, I saw no difference between the two version plot-wise: Miramax was indeed planning to change it, Tarantino protested, and it was left alone for the most part because Miramax stipulated that Tarantino's name had to be at the head of the credits, as you an see on the DVD cover. All this can be learnt at IMDB.<br /><br />Additionally to say that the movie did not do well in North America is hilariously misguided: it debuted at No.1 and stayed in that spot for two weeks. How many foreign, sub-titled \\"indie\\" films manage to do that?<br /><br />I plan to buy this DVD as well...the movie is that good. :) The characters are interesting, the story is riveting and the cinematography is gorgous (and I don't usually notice such things).
0735619670|5.0|This is the best book I have ever read on the theory and practice of programming. Now that I have moved from being a programmer to managing programmers I make it a point to buy a copy of this book for every programmer that works for me. I have seen pretty sloppy programmers make a 180 degree turn on the quality of the work I get from them.
B00005JMJG|3.0|I loved the subject matter of this movie; the creativity was stunning.  The acting was superb all around; a real demonstration of Jim Carrey's brilliance.  My only problem with it (which really detracted from the experience) was that the memory erasure scenes went on forever, and eventually got rather boring.  The part where \\"Joel\\" reverted to his childhood and was under the kitchen table was especially lengthy and laborious.  Also, I failed to see a lot of humor in this movie; disappointing since I had seen it billed as a comedy.  Still, it was an intellectually stimulating movie and worth watching.
B00005JLO2|2.0|Although watching a British regiment form a square and repel Sudanese marauders from all sides is reminicent of the brilliant and underrated Zulu (1964) and a thing to behold, one battle sequence cannot overcome two more hours of poor characterization and a rambling plot.<br /><br />Harry Faversham is a standard young British Officer, serving with his friends and engaged to the beautiful Ethne.  However, when the regiment receives word that it is to be sent to the Sudan to battle rebels, he abruptly resigns his commisson and is branded as a coward by his friends and fiance, who send him four white feathers as a sign of cowardice.<br /><br />Eventually Harry goes down to the Sudan to avenge these feathers or something, and the movie rapidly goes downhill.  Aside from the aforementioned battle scene, there's very little here.  Towards the end of the movie things get very reminiscent of Midnight Express, which isn't necceasrily a bad thing except for the fact that Turkish prison sequences seem rather out of place in a 19th Century War movie.<br /><br />Djimon Hounsou, who you may remember as Maximus's ally in Gladiator, has a role as a guardian angel for Harry.  No real reason is given as to why this guy goes out of his way to save Harry's life so many times, run through the desert for him, etc.  I suppose it goes back to that colonial veiwpoint that black people merely serve to fulfill the wishes and needs of their white subjugators.  Pathetic.  4/10
B0001NBMBC|4.0|Let's face it. Slipknot has changed. Both lyrically and melodically, the 'infamous nontet' has matured. For the better? That is something for you to decide. <br /> <br />Previously, what 'Knot handed us, the fans, was an unpolished crappy version of a song that could have been better. I loved that. However, for those of you who absolutely adored their previous work (talking about their self-titled, some parts of Iowa) should consider this album, but keep in mind that this is a completely different style. If you want stuff similar to that displayed in their self-titled, I suggest you look into bands such as Korn. For those of you willing to try anything, I suggest you pick up this album. <br /> <br />I think (and note that this is purely subjective) that the change is one for the better. The tracks are mopped up and clean cut... at least relatively. In some songs, such as 'The Blister Exists' and 'Pulse of the Maggots', their previous style is unmistakably present, whereas in some others, such as 'Circle' and 'Vermilion, Pt. 2', tracks are transposed to acoustic and played as a sort of ballad. Some songs, such as 'Duality' and 'Before I Forget', are somewhere in the middle, matching some of 'Iowa's tones. <br /> <br />If you liked 'Duality', you will lick up this album. The first single pretty much sums up the feel. If you're still not sure, listen to 'Pulse of the Maggots' and 'Circle'. Those will help you make the final decision. Even if you only like two of the three, I still suggest you try this album out.  <br /> <br />Slipknot's greatest accomplishment? Maybe. Whatever the case, they're headed in the right direction.
B00005JNEI|2.0|I came in to the movie with an open ear, but I was afraid this movie would be a mess and my fears came true.  Moore is a terrible documentarist.  This movie is erratic, incoherent, and sometimes just plain pointless.  The way Moore uses war images and people crying to \\"move\\" the audience is cringe-worthy.  I thought the one thing that would at least entertain me during this movie were the funny Bush screw-up scenes, but it actually ended up being the middle half of the film where Moore ties in the Bush family's relation to the Saudis.  This was eye-opening material and if Moore had decided to stick this subject for the entire movie and make it a true documentary it could have been something very important.  Instead we are stuck most of the time with Moore's annoying narration and images that tell us nothing new.
B0002TSZK6|1.0|I watched Fahrenheit 9/11 with an open mind.  However, I have to say that I have never seen a movie use or misuse video clips to swing opinion.  I have seen several of the clips from his movie in their entire form ane have to say that his view and slant on them are entirely left wing.  The sad part is he has totally misrepresented them and has misused his liberty to express his opinion by turning truths into lies.  Anyone who believes this movie obviously does not do their own research and only believes what they hear on tv.  I would hope that people would combat their own ignorance by reading and researching instead of having to wait until they lose their jobs or means of supporting themselves due to a horrible president.  Anyone who would believe that Fahrenheit 9/11 is a real documentary instead of Michael Moore's opinion is someone who is too lazy to do one's own research on the facts.  Just go look up the facts.  Don't rely on people like Moore who only wants you to believe what he belives.  That is how communists act.  This is America.  Exercise your right to do your own research of the facts.  In communist countries they are forced to believe lies and cannot do the research.  Don't let them control you by your own ignorance.  Exercise your right to make educated and sound decisions.
B000267JQK|3.0|This cd is a re-release of their 'Disclaimer' cd. Although I was impressed with all the extras on the cd itself and also the DVD that's included. There are several flat out amazing songs on this cd, but it's not at all what I anticipated. 'Gasoline' is a power driven track that sets off the cd beautifully. I wasn't impressed though by the second track. Some of the best songs on this cd are one's that would be played on the radio had they released them. Songs like 'Gasoline', 'Needles', 'Pride', 'Sympathetic', 'Fade Away', and 'Hang On' make this cd well worth the price though. I admit I bought this cd after hearing 'Broken' featuring Amy Lee. I loved the way Shaun fed off of Amy's beautiful vocals. This is a solid release despite some slip ups, I do recommend this cd to people who are into rock.
B00005JMAH|3.0|While the movie was entertaining it did not even come close to living up to my expectations.  One of the biggest disappointments for me was that they failed to keep some of the very elements of the book that explained the story line.  For instance they didn't explain the significance or the history of the Shrieking Shack.  Therefore you didn't really understand why it was there.  In addition they didn't explain why Harry's Patronus was the same animal that was connected to his father.  Very disappointing.
B00005JN7O|5.0|Sky Captain is a action-packed film that is truly one of the best films of it's kind. It's like Star Wars, Indiana Jones, and several other different movies(Batman, Superman, King Kong,Etc.) all rolled into one. Acting is very memorable(with Jude Law as Joe\\"Sky Captain\\" Sullivan, Gwyneth Paltrow as reporter Polly Perkins, Giovanni Ribinsi as Sky Captain's loyal ally Dex, and Angelina Jolie as Capt. Frankie Cook, a loyal friend of Sky Captain's). As for everything else(visual effects, direction, even story was pretty good) was very good. All in all, a terrific film that is truly worth seeing. I can't wait for a sequal!!!!!!!!!!!!
B00005JMEW|3.0|If you don't like Quentin Tarantino films you might as well just move on now.  This is a modern day movie with old school martial arts.  The action shots were well done.  You might get a little lost with the time warps but as I said if you don't like Tarantino Films just move on.
0783225849|5.0|Psycho is the ultimate horror movie. It allows viewers to use their imaginations. Our imaginations will make the killings a lot worse, than if Alfred Hitchcock were to show us what happened. With awesome camera angles that add to the horrific effect and draw us in, Psycho hits the top 100 list with a bang. If you liked the plot of obsession, sex, and violence in Hitchcock's second greatest film, I must recommend everyone see Hitchcock's GREATEST film of all time: VERTIGO. Jimmy Stewart Rocks!
B0002BK9J4|5.0|I don't know why this album did not make a bigger splash when it came out. Its fun and tight through and through with some of their best work. Track #7 \\"Take It as It Comes\\" alone is worth the price of the CD but all the tracks will have you hoping.  <br /> <br />While you are here pick up Acid Eaters (another gem that I waited to long to get also).
078322737X|5.0|I can't say enough about how truly classic and great this film is. Without a doubt deserving of its AFI 100 Greatest Films of all time list. And I think this film even surpases Lucas' most known films - \\"The Star Wars Trilogy\\". The basic theme of this film is -- \\"the end of eras\\".It was the end of peace im America, before the war in Vietnam broke out. It was before America's rock n roll suddenly became Englands rock and roll. It was the end of cruising, a very popular American mating ritual. The Nostalgia showcased in this film is quite thick. And although it is a comedy, it is also a drama and its the best kind of drama. It isn't in your face - you have to find it in the end. This film perfectly showcases the end of the GOlden days in AMerica. Its here in all its glory. Superb acting, directing, and the ammount of classic cars and classic rock n roll tunes from the 50's and 60's alone is worth 3 stars. 10 minutes into this film - you will be hooked. You will want to see it over and over again. It is truly an American classic from one of America's Greatest Filmakers!
B00005JMAH|5.0|As I read over the reviews, I noticed that a lot were from a young child's perspective. Well, I am 19 years old and asolutely loved this film. 'Philosoper's Stone' and 'Chamber of Secrets' were good films on their own, but the Chris Colombus took such great pains into making the movies exactly like the books so that even the completely unecessary information was in there. It made for an occasionally boring movie. <br /> <br />What Alfonso Cuaron did was cut all the extraneous scenes while still relaying the plot line of the story. Yes, I was disappointed by the lack of Quidditch and the amount of backstory they gave on Harry's parents but it was still a greatly entertaining movie. It was more action-packed and had a much more mature feel to it - I think that's where the bad reviews are coming from. <br /> <br />J.K. Rowling, the author of the series, had said many times that the books are going to get darker, scarier and more mature as the sudents get older. I think that Cuaron did a wonderful job realizing that and it showed in his movie. A lot of children may not enjoy this because it wasn't a play-by-play like 'Philosopher' and 'Chamber.' Teenagers and adults will be able to appreciate this film much more due to the way Cuaron directed it. <br /> <br />And remember, J.K. Rowling had to have approval on the final script and the omissions it made. She obviously approves of this film. She even said on her website that she loved it and it was her favorite of the films so far. And if it's good enough for the author - the creator - of the series, it's good enough for me.
0783225857|5.0|This movie shows the truth of life and the unfair things that can happen. Gregory Peck plays the #1 hero of all time, Atticus Finch, who is on a mission to do what is right whatever the costs may be. He faces many hindrances along the way, but takes them like a man and refuses to give up. By defending a black man, Tom Robinson, wrongly accused of rape, he does what no other attorney in Maycomb has the courage to do. Atticus' acts also have a deep effect on his children, Jem and Scout who remember his incrdible bravery forever. I love how this film shows that people don't have to succeed to be heroes. Good things can come from the effort, too.You are crazy if you do not at least like this film. It is an American classic that cannot be forgotten.
B000006NPY|5.0|Unlike most of my peers at the time when Smashing Pumpkins were all the rage, I did not care for their music at all, and felt their radio releases were way overplayed.  Hearing this album, however, actually made me want to listen.  While most of their other albums relied on heavier noise, Adore proves that subtlety can be more powerful and emotionally impacting, in a less is more kind of way.  I especially enjoy Blank Page, Crestfallen, and Ava Adore.  This album is their standout for being non-mainstream.  I hate listening to stuff that sounds like everything else out there, and this definitely has a unique, soul-baring sound.  The result-- an ear-opening experience ... but as it seems from a lot of others' negative feedback, apparently you have to have an open mind as well.
B000059H99|5.0|Every once in a while a movie comes along that can inspire and touch our hearts with inspiration that can last a lifetime. The movie Rocky is not only one of greatest and most memorable films ever made, it also leaves a mark on each viewer who has seen this masterpiece of a movie. I can't help but smile when I see Sylvester Stallone's training sequence because it means so much more than what meets the eye. It symbolizes a dream every single person has had at one time in their lives, the desire to achieve that dream no matter what anyone believes or says. It symbolizes that we can achieve that dream and the moment we do and it is our turn to dance around on the top of the steps because we made it, the feeling will be indescribable.
B000063COX|5.0|Iron Maiden's Self-Titled Debut album is, in my opinion, their most underrated. It is up their with \\"Powerslave\\" and \\"Seventh Son of a Seventh Son\\". It is the best album that they did with Paul Di'anno. <br /> <br />The Album starts off with the classic \\"Prowler\\", which like on most all of the Maiden albums is the absolute Perfect opening number. The solo in this blows my mind. It is just awesome. Not my favorite on the album, but it is still very very good. <br /> <br />Next up is \\"Sanctuary\\", and like the opener it is well paced with awesome riffs in between. I really love this song, just as much as I love Prowler. Paul does some of his best vocals in this song. <br /> <br />Then comes the slower paced yet riff heavy \\"Remember Tommorow\\". I love this song just as the last two, and it is extremely different from both of them. More of a slower paced song, where Di'Anno hits some great vocals and the riffs in between, are just mind boggling. <br /> <br />\\"Running Free\\", the fourth song on the Album is overrated, in my opinion. I like it, just not as much as the others. I usually skip it to get to the next track... <br /> <br />PHANTOM OF THE OPERA! What a Song! Without a doubt, this is the best song on the whole album.The Riffs are some of the best you will ever here, and fit in so perfectly with the song, that it is almost unbelievable. This is one of my Favorite Maiden tracks, along with some Live Classics, \\"Fear of The Dark\\", \\"Hallowed be thy Name\\", \\"Seventh Son of a Seveth Son\\", and MANY MANY other songs. It just goes to show how great Iron Maiden really is. <br /> <br />The next track is the first of four instrumentals that Iron Maiden has done in their careers, and in my opinion it's up there with Ghengis Khan. It's a nice track that you should never skip. It's really Great. <br /> <br />\\"Strange World\\" is up next. I was really shocked when I first heard this song, it was almost like it was done by a completely different band. It's a slow, almost blues typr song. It has Great Lyrics, it's similar to \\"Remember Tommorow\\", and the solos are some of the best I'vce heard from Dave Murray and Iron Maiden. This is one of my favorite tracks on the whole album! <br /> <br />\\"Charlotte the Harlot\\" is an AWESOME song, kinda fast paced at the start then it slows down, then ends fast. Great riffs, again. This and \\"22 Acacia Avenue\\"(from the classic, \\"Number of the Beast\\") are my favorite songs in the Charlotte Saga. Which is actually really saying something, as \\"Hooks in You\\"(From the album \\"No Prayer for the Dying\\") and \\"From here to Eternity\\"(From the album \\"Fear of the Dark\\") are really great songs! <br /> <br />The album ends with the bands anthem, \\"Iron Maiden\\". It is a somewhat simple song, yet it ius always fun to listen to and the chorus is very addictive.
B00006BTCA|4.0|After countless recommendations and dabbling in several of Interpol's songs, I decided to throw caution to the wind and pick up \\"Turn on the bright lights\\".  Now, let me be very clear about something before even starting to praise this album.  Not everyone will like this, in fact if you're not a fan of bands that ooze of Radiohead influences you're probably going to find this album not suiting.  There's nothing wrong with this, it's just one of those albums which appeals to some, and to others sounds like garbage. <br /> <br />With that being said I can be categorized in the group of people which really enjoyed \\"Turn on the bright lights\\".  Upon first listen it struck me as something unique, something that would appeal more and more with every listen, those assumptions were well rewarded.  Each time I played through the album I found something new, something interesting that I hadn't noticed previously.  Each track on the album is a seemingly small experience in itself, the ambient guitars, the dense rhythym section and the haunting/melancholy vocals seem to feed off eachother.  <br /> <br />It's not often that an album such as this one comes out, and it's well worth a listen for those of you who enjoy challenging if not  ocassionally confusing rock.
B000002KB8|5.0|This is Black Sabbath's classic debut album. I've loved it since first listen, and with out this and the first 4 Sabbath albums most bands wouldn't even be around today. Here's the lowdown on the songs: <br /> <br />Black Sabbath-What a classic song! It has such an awesome eerie feel to it, and it really gets the point of what this band is trying to get across. After the doom in this song, they hit you with a extremely heavy hard hitting riff that will be forever lodged into your head. <br /> <br />The Wizard-Ozzy is on the Harmonica in this song. The Harmonica actually fits in greatly with the music here. It makes for an all around great song. <br /> <br />WASP/Behind the Wall of Sleep/Basically/Nativity in Black-WASP/Behind the Wall of Sleep kicks off this sort of a jam session track and it's a great song. Nice Riffs by Iommi. I especially love the intro. Basically is a short little basss in between the songs. And then the classic N.I.B(Nativity in Black) kicks in, and it is a song that is the favorites of many Sabbath freaks like me. It is truly one of the highlight songs of Black Sabbath's career. The main riff is practically an infamous Heavy metal guitar lick. And the solos and other riffs are obvious classics also. <br /> <br />Wicked World- Great song here. I love the lyrics, great bass and guitar work like usual from Tony and Geezer. It gives you a nice little break in between the long tracks of the album. <br /> <br />Evil Woman- A Bit of Finger/Sleeping Village/Warning make up this track, that most Sabbath fans just call Evil Woman, as do I. This is a truly underrated masterpiece in my opinion. Sure, it may just be a semi-jam session, but what a great jam session it is! The riff at around the first minute sounds like a Zeppelin riff, and that is, of course, a great thing. All of the solos and guitar work through Evil Woman are just fantastic, and as a guitar player myself, I really just have to respect this song. <br /> <br />
0375422889|5.0|I wrote a review for the first Persepolis as well. I enjoyed the second greatly. This is a big statement, being that I was so impressed by the first that I had huge expectations of the 2nd, and could have easily been dissappointed. This book is honest in showing clashes between Eastern and Western cultures and an adolescent's reactions to these clashes.  Ms. Satrapi whets the appetite for understanding the different types of Iranians: the traditionalists, the religious, the modern people, those who've returned from expatriation.  She touches on the issue of women's role in Iran. As an Iranian, I can vouch for most of Marjane's accounts, as interactions like she's had are not so uncommon.  Many Iranians left the country at young ages after the revolution and during the war.  Many have seen what Marjane has and it's really the voice of a generation. You may understand your Iranian neighbors better if you read this book. I also know tons of other nationalities and cultures who have similar experiences with their expatriation. Marjane expresses many different aspects of the coming-of-age process in short, concise chapters which manage to keep their wit, charm and creative expression of the first book. Read and enjoy!
B0000013GT|5.0|Hey guys..here's the deal.  I've listened to every single supposedly great album out there including: <br /> <br />All Eyez On Me <br />Life After Death <br />Do you want more?!?! <br />Lep Zeppelin <br />Black Album <br />Every Beatles Album <br /> <br />and I have to say that this is, in my opinion, the best rap album ever.  What sets this apart from every album is that EVERY song is AWESOME.  I know this sounds cliche, but look back at my list of albums.  Every one of em had at least 4-5 songs where you just go \\"Meh, I'll skip it.\\"  NOT THIS ONE.  Every song is amazing!  It's a laid back album that you can just chill to on a weekend, or bump in your car... <br /> <br />All songs are awesome, but highlights are: <br />ATLiens (one of the best rap songs ever) <br />Babylon (pretty awesome lyrics, and chorus) <br />Wheelz of Steel (scratching sounds awesome) <br />Elevators (Sick rappin') <br /> <br />Highly recomended..buy this album, you won't regret it
B00005R24G|5.0|As an earlier reviewers has pointed out, Anchor Bay has released TWO different prints of Sleuth, so you'll want to be careful which release you purchase.  The older release had an unsatisfactory transfer that looked very bad.  That version was a flipper disc and was packaged with a WHITE cover, and Anchor Bay has wisely let it go out of print.  Avoid it!  (Unless you collect OOP DVDs....)    The newer release has a BLACK cover and boasts a much improved transfer.  (Just compare the vibrancy of the colors in the film to the muted colors in the unrestored trailers to see what I mean.)  In addition to putting the whole film on one side of the disc, Anchor Bay also included an extensive and fairly interesting interview with writer Anthony Shaffer.  This version is probably definitive -- and certainly the one to buy.    Apparently, however, Anchor Bay is going to let this release go out of print, too.  (It has disappeared from their online catalogue.)  So buy this quickly if you have any interest in it at all.  I can't imagine any other company giving this film a better overall treatment.
B0002VEW1K|4.0|I remember this album on vinyl from my past and am glad it is now on CD.  It didn't get much attention as there are no real AM hits on here, but very good, orignial songs.  This is by far my favorite album by Procol Harum and I recommend you give it a try, I think you will be pleasantly surprised.
B00005JMEW|4.0|kill bill vol.1 is better than i thought it would be. this film was way better than volume 2. tarantino did a vary good job on this movie. this is the most violent movie i have ever seen.
B00005JNEI|5.0|If anyone shall diss George W. Bush, this is the way to do it.  Michael Moore, one of the finest documentary filmmakers of today, produced, directed, and wrote \\"Fahrenheit 9/11\\", proving the truths of the last two years.  He takes his 2002 Oscar acceptance speech (Best Documentary Feature--\\"Bowling For Columbine\\"), which had some cheering fanaticly and some booing irately, into greater depths.  Few other filmmakers have dared to explore such subject matter.  This film has been highly praised by many critics and recommended by several celebrities including Madonna and Linda Ronstadt. <br /> <br />This blunt, fearless filmmaker explores how this country and the military has been deceived by Bush, especially with the War In Iraq.  The featured documents, interviews, and archive film scenes help prove his point wonderfully.  Beyond that, he argues his subject matter beautifully.  The film starts with how Bush managed to slide into presidency in 2000, then shows his \\"workmanship\\".  Once the Twin Towers footage from 9/11 is featured, it begins growing into emotion and anger.  Moore brilliantly keeps audiences interested in every scene through his witty remarks, his interviews, and his personal reactions to every scene.  Through everything, he expresses his true compassion for this country, the people, and those highly affected by Bush's deception. <br /> <br />This film features various celebrities: Britney Spears, Rick Martin, Ben Affleck, Stevie Wonder, and others.  The words of the politicians and the average US citizens also add to the personal film connection.  The various arguments prove various points that this country has.  This features how some have learned the true meaning of \\"anti-war\\". <br /> <br />\\"Fahrenheit 9/11\\" is a must-watch film for every citizen, especially before the upcoming election.  This proves the truths of what has happened.  Republican, democrat, independant, pro-war, or anti-war: many are sure to react emotionally to this subject matter.  This is sure to be a big wake-up call for many viewers.
068987474X|4.0|I think that if you are in a relationship and are buying this book, you already know that \\"he's just not that into you\\".  However, if you, like me, were not sure that you wanted to end the relationship with the person you know is \\"just not that into you\\", this book will help give you the courage to do so.  It did for me and it was a good feeling to finally let go of a relationship that was going nowhere.  I don't want to waste another minute of my precious time.  This book made me realize that I have a lot to offer and should not be handing myself on a silver platter to a man who just doesn't appreciate what he's got.  It is hard to face the truth sometimes, but if you will remind yourself that there is something better for you around the corner and stop wishing for something that is not going to happen, it can be done!
B0002OERI0|5.0|This is their best CD! I enjoy every single song. My personal favorites are Jesus of Suburbia, Holiday, Boulevard of Broken Dreams, and Give Me Novacaine. Their sound gets more unique with every new CD they come out with. This is a must buy. I'm not going to go on and on about particulars and specifics so in a nutshell, this is great!
B000002KLP|4.0|I was 14 when this album came out. There was a warning sticker on the album. I thought I was too young to buy the album so I bought it at 17. PRINCE's DIRTY MIND was raunchy but it makes MILLIE JACKSON look like AMY GRANT.<br /><br />I mean \\"Dirty Mind\\" and \\"Head\\" are actually the sexually explicit songs here. Maybe \\"Do It All Night\\" too. \\"Sister\\" talks about incent with, guess who. Wow, really dirty man, but I love that song though. \\"Dirty Mind\\" 'you just gotta let me lay ya down, in my daddy's car, it's YOU I really wanna drive' catchy. \\"When You We're Mine\\" a plea song covered also by CYNDI LAUPER and MITCH RYDER to name a few. \\"Do It All Night\\" is just a rock-funk feel good groove, I see no real dirtiness to it really. \\"Gotta Broken Heart Again\\" is something I can relate to, grown up a loner, the gunshot at the end of the song...well, I can relate PRINCE. \\"Uptown\\" and \\"PartyUp\\" from hangin' in the neighborhood to just forgetting about war and having some freakin' fun. \\"Head\\", see I like LISA COLEMAN and I like the funky sounds of \\"Head\\", but to me \\"Head\\" could have been more filthy, lyrically and LISA could have sounded more interested in givin' PRINCE...ah... \\"Sister\\", satire maybe, is a great song although of its rock n' roll outing (I was just starting to feel for R.N.R. at this time) but 'my sister never gave a g'damn'.<br /><br />None of these 8 songs disappoint. Sounds like he recorded it where THE TIME recorded their first album, in a non-reverbration attic. Nonetheless, it's an important album in rock n' roll and in PRINCE pop and rock uprising to the top.
B00005JNEI|5.0|This is a great movie.  Some of the material presented here you will not see on network TV and frankly it needs to be seen.  From Al Gore ending senate debate on the outright fraud in Florida, to GW Bush calling the rich his base.  This is an insightful film. <br /> <br />Moore uses his usual tongue and cheek methods which have already inflamed the rabid right wing but Moore has a good point to make about Bush and corrupt politics. <br /> <br />I highly recommend everyone see this film.
B000000WJZ|5.0|You'd have to be an idiot not to give it five stars.  Amazing album from an amazing band.  Nearly all the songs have guitar solos, or at least musical breaks.  Music ranges from loud and heavy to soft acoustic; and from fast to slow.  Many songs have been played on the radio, you'll realize it after you listen to them.  Anyone who's turned on the radio in the past 10 years knows the song \\"Today\\".  Buy the album, you won't be let down.  Smashing Pumpkins were one of the best bands ever, don't pass up this gem.
B00006L3LD|5.0|This album is amazing. A must have. This is one of the few cd's that I can listen to all the way through without pressing the skip button. If you're looking for a good chill album, this is it. Brandon's voice is absolutely beautiful and compliments the wonderful guitar and drum arrangements perfectly. Incubus is the real thing- truly gifted musicians all the way around and will definitely be around for a long time. GO BUY THIS ALBUM RIGHT NOW!!!
B00006GO9Q|5.0|This isn't the \\"first fusion album\\".  This wasn't Miles Davis's first recording with electric keyboards or, for that matter, the electric guitar.  He'd been experimenting with rock, soul and pop rhythms for over a year.  And yet In a Silent Way really is a first.  It's the first Davis album in a new, undefined style -- informed heavily by jazz, but already heading somewhere else. <br /> <br />It's also the last Tony Williams appearance on a Davis album.  Supposedly Williams, who was starting Lifetime with organist Larry Young and guitarist John McLaughlin, was angry and paranoid at the thought of Miles poaching his star guitarist.  So for most of the CD, he plays a very repetitive rhythm -- hi hat on the first half, snare on the second - except for one brief moment, which I'll get back to shortly. <br /> <br />McLaughlin isn't the firebrand of the Mahavishnu Orchestra or Jack Johnson; his playing is very circumspect and cautious, blending in very well with the triple-keyboard stew of Chick Corea, Herbie Hancock and Joe Zawinul.  Dave Holland grooves along with those funky basslines he's so good at producing.  It's a testament to these great musicians that they constantly manage to keep things interesting in a fairly repetitive setting and never get in each other's way.  Aside from a few collective improvisations by the rhythm section, the only soloists on this CD are Miles, Wayne Shorter (playing lovely, snaking lines on the soprano), and John McLaughlin. <br /> <br />The music, like many of the recordings Miles would make over the next six years, consists of lengthy medleys over funky vamps.  In each, the first five minutes are repeated via splicing at the end.  That kind of repetition would be irritating in other contexts, but here it's extremely effective.  \\"Shhh/Peaceful\\" is one of those pieces doesn't really go anywhere but offering a fun ride as it motors along; it can work as background, and yet teems with detail for the attentive listener.  \\"In a Silent Way\\", Miles's striking interpretation of Zawinul's tune, is one of the most striking pieces of music in jazz history; first John McLaughlin tentatively stating the theme, next Wayne coming in on soprano, and finally Miles stepping in.  Beautiful.  Then the lightly funky groove of \\"It's About That Time\\" comes in.  It slowly rises in intensity during John and Wayne's solo turns, setting up Miles for some of the best (and seemingly effortless) playing of his career.  He paces the notes perfectly, and then when Tony Williams finally cuts loose... well, if you've heard it, you know it's one of the most exhilirating things ever set to tape.  The repeat of the title track brings the album to a perfect close -- a return to motionless silence. <br /> <br />A lot of people associate Miles's electric music with lengthy, amelodic jams.  And while some of it really is like that, those wary of albums like Bitches Brew and Pangaea might still like the subtle, melodic beauty of In a Silent Way.  In fact, I think that this album contains the seeds to unlocking the mystery of those wonderful but difficult recordings.  Try it out -- I think you'll like it.
B0002OERI0|5.0|This highly anticipated album strikes the music scene bluntly and has caused a division in the Punk Rock world. I am not speaking of the glaring differential between the likes of Pop Punk aka Blink182 and the middle school Punk bands such as the Epitaph revolution, or the old school bands rising out of the gutters of New York with great respect and hope for a grand response to the ever dying motion of Hip-Hop and Rap music. We have experienced a new standard in the Punk rock genre. It has reached its artistic bandwidth far surpassing any previous attempt to make your music \\"mainstream.\\" Many fans will hate this album because of what it represents to the ever growing and experimentation of Green Day.  <br />I started with Green Day along with every 14 year old in the summer of 1994 with the release of their \\"Dookie\\" Album. The album itself bridged the gap between the gutter and the hills. Punk officially became mainstream and paved the way for every second rate act to arrive on the scene. Bands such as Blink182, Good Charlotte, Less than Jake, and many others hit the pop icon stage under the heels of Green Day. They were revolutionary then, again causing great division in the Punk genre. They showed the industry that Punk sells, and their records were being bought up faster than they could make them by the hard earning kids who support the majority of the industry. We hit the shows, we buy the t-shirts, and we violate the shelves for import singles and hard to find b-sides of these bands. Why? We simply engross ourselves into something better than everyday life.  <br />Now at 25, having lost sight of Green Day, I hear of a new album coming down the pike. I am enthralled by the first single \\"American Idiot\\" due to its political undertones and being a bigger fan of Bad Religion, let's just say that I am thrilled by the fact someone has the know-how and the audacity to criticize this failing government. I am a proud owner of both \\"Rock against Bush\\" compilation albums.\\"American Idiot\\" could not come at a better time. Once listening to the album, I was star struck. Welcome to the new age of Punk, where bands will only emulate this new strategy of music layering and artistic bravery. <br />The most important aspect to the new album is that it tries to do more than a typical band. Artistically, Green Day is paying tribute to the concept album days of rock where each song tied into another telling a horrific story of trials and challenges a person faces. After we tore down the wall, Green Day decided to do something worthwhile with their voice and fanfare, \\"let's take our fans on a musical journey through our minds and projections of the world around us.\\" We live in a troubled world and we have a national government that wants us to be afraid. We are all American idiots if we do not rise above that propaganda and look towards the future. This album functions as a warning to what is expected to come. If you own the album, be sure to have the lyrics in hand. Make a connection with the ever changing harmonies and daring word structures that weave in and out of each other. We have just experienced Punk rock perfection, paying tribute to the Rock geniuses of our past; Green Day represents the future of our beloved Punk Genre. Selling out is for sellouts. These artists simply push the bar ever increasing the path towards a solid following... <br />
068987474X|1.0|The only good part of this book is the title. Its pointless, stupid, greg acts like a no it all and i dont know who he is trying to fool trying to pass of as a straight man. He is so GAY! <br />Dont waste the $$$ on this book. Even for trash books its really bad.
0606004637|3.0|I decided to read this book based on positive reviews.  Within itself it was an OK read, much like hundreds of other books.  But in the end I found it unremarkable and a bit disappointing.  I was discouraged to see Clarke use parapsychological phenomena the way he did.  His usage didn't make me think \\"Hmm, maybe that could work\\" but instead I thought \\"Gee, that's pretty lame.\\"  There was really nothing thought-provoking in this book.
B0002234LS|5.0|Secret Window is the best film of this century and of all the other centuries before and after that. Johnny Depp was so f****ing hot, he is the only reason why i bl**dy well watch that c**p. Just look at him through the whole film and that will make the film the best! I loved watching him kill his wife with a shuvel, ths means he's single again! hahahaha (joke)
B000001EUR|5.0|Their best effort to date even better than Blackout, which I never thought could happen. This album starts off rockin with Bad boys running wild, (it just smokes), the classic Rock you like a hurricane,(a definite 1980's classic), My personal fave I'm leaving you,(Mindblowing song), the bombastic The same thrill, another classic Big city nights(How sweet),the groove of As soon as the good times roll, and the slow rocker that has been a mood maker for millions, Still loving you. I must admit I wore out my cassette twice over the years, this is soo damn good. On disc it is so much better, wow!! I always thought Mathias Jabs was one of the most underrated guitarists of the 80's, period! He had speed and finesse but he had some feeling that many others didn't. And who could forget Herman (the German) Rarebell, his playing was simple but this guy was really good. The solos on Bad boys, Hurricane, I'm leaving you and Big City nights are truly inspiring!!!An amazing record by an amazing band. A true metal classic that brings back many good memories. Take it from a 35 year old headbanger, buy this and rock on!!!!!
B00004W48E|5.0|Looky looky, im the first one to write a review on this cr*p, and ur not, u must all be blonde. Actually, its a rather nice piece of cr*p starring johnny depp, who i could eat with a spoon. I couldn't eat him with a knife because he would just slide off the edge of it, i couldn't eat him with a fork because he would just fall through the cracks, maybe if he's lucky, an arse crack. So a spanner wouldn't b ideal as it has a hole in the end of it and if he was on it he would try and make a secret window out of that hole. Some windows should never be opened, or arse cracks, especially johnny depp's which reaks and i know this because i live iun it. Im so good at writting these reviews, im owed a medal.
B0001I561E|5.0|O.k ,so i bought this DVD because of Clay aikens renditon of proud of your boy, it is a heartwarming song and i am thrilled to see him sing it and it is wonderfully written,wonderfully sung by Clay  as always ,it's worth to simply buy this DVD to just  hear this very special song sung by a very special singer. <br />Aladdin is a great story and one of my favourite disney movies but this special edition is wonderfully crystal clear, sounds are amazing  and colours just so vibrant and i am very happy i bought it. <br />the jessica simpson/nick lachay remake duet of whole new world does not match up to the original,the original video is there too and it is so nice to see peabo bryson and regina bell. <br /> <br />i felt so much of a kid again watching it.
0393035158|5.0|I simply don't believe anybody who gives this book one star has actually read it. Even if you disagree entirely, it's still thoughtful and insightful. To all the one-star reviewers: don't be so fearful. Try actually reading it before you condemn it! If your faith is real, then the book can't hurt you! Or is your faith so weak that it cannot even withstand one man's challenge? <br /> <br />I'd just like to add to the discussion one little point: some people object to the Church simply because it stands in the way of direct spiritual experience. If you've already settled in your own mind what God is all about, then how can God speak to you? This is what Buddhists mean by \\"If you meet the Buddha on the road, kill him.\\" It's a way of saying \\"Your spirituality shouldn't be a received idea. Don't take other peoples' word for it--listen with your own heart, find your own struggle, make up your own mind.\\"  <br /> <br />What I found most valuable about \\"The End of Faith\\" is that it gives cogent reasons for rejecting \\"moderate\\" religiosity. I've always been able to disagree with fundamentalism, extremism, and even to reject the entire philosophical underpinning of the church; but then what of the nice little old lady across the street who goes to Mass three times a week and bakes everybody cookies? What of the good-hearted friend who just cannot bear the death of a loved one without the idea of heaven? What of the ex-addict whose belief in Jesus is what propelled him into public service and keeps him off the junk? I've always gotten weak in my convictions when faced with some of the milder, more \\"social\\" forms of piety. Harris gives a very good account of why we ought not to conspire in those delusions. (The trick, of course, would be whether you could be honest about rejecting all faith while still being accepting and kind-hearted towards the faithful.) <br /> <br />In half a century as a committed reader, this is one of the best books I've ever read. Highly recommended, forthe faithful as well as the lapsarian.
B000002MG1|5.0|The dark fragility of \\"Automatic for the People\\" is like nothing else in REM's catalog. It is all of a piece, every song supporting the other, accenting the mood as it lifts and dips from one level to the next. The closing track, \\"Find the River\\", is as good a closing number as you will find anywhere, from anyone. REM may not be able to make another album as good as this one, but then I don't believe anyone else will either.
B000069HK2|4.0|The Used are a very great band that rip down barriers of music and seemingly bounce all over the different genres of Rock and Roll to deliver a powerhouse of a debut that is entertaining from start to finish.  <br /> <br />From the detailed heartbreaks of ''On My Own'' and ''Buried Myself Alive'' to the grand intensity of ''Maybe Memories,'' this album contains enough variety to impress even the most jaded of music fans.  <br /> <br />Lyrically the album is a rollercoaster of emotions. Bert is not afraid to let it all loose, and showcases this among the albums songs without sounding phony or pretensious.  <br /> <br />The album is a landmark in showcasing that a lot of new bands do have talent and will not be ignored for much longer.
B0001HAISG|2.0|I was looking forward to seeing this film, as I love the story of Peter Pan, but this version just didn't work for me.<br /><br />First of all, while staying true to Barrie's original story, the first 30 minutes almost appeared to be a remake of Spielberg's \\"Hook\\" than a novelization of the story. Even the music sounded similar to John Williams' 1991 score. I found myself immediately disliking the actor who portrayed Pan, and most especially, his horrible grin that he felt the need to show every 30 seconds. I wouldn't say he was a bad actor, but he definitely was guilty of overacting during MANY instances of this film, and he just wasn't a very likeable kid in general. The only actor who I disliked more is Ludivine Sagnier as Tinkerbell. I really wish they would have killed her off in the first few minutes because she became VERY annoying. She is a fairly odd-looking person, which I guess fairies are supposed to be, but if anyone on this film was guilty of overacting it's definitely her. All of her ridiculous facial expressions were just plain annoying rather than cute. I really hated seeing her onscreen, and I didn't buy her love for Pan like I did with Julia Roberts in \\"Hook.\\" She didn't seem to have any remorse about trying to have Wendy killed, so it was hard to like this character.<br /><br />The film also contains some ridiculous action sequences that came off looking absurd. At one point there are two children riding on the back of a dog, while lying on their backs. In another, a child is flipped through the air and looks like he's doing cartwheels in space or something. In the opening scene, Pan is trying to catch his shadow in Wendy's room, and breaks or knocks over half of the furniture in his attempt. 10 minutes later, and after the room is destroyed, we're shown that Wendy's brothers are in the same room asleep! I don't know if they were on drugs or what but there's no way they could have slept through that.<br /><br />Cinematography on this film is excellent however. The film makes an excellent audio and video transfer to disc. This is one of the most phenomenal visual representations I've seen of a movie on home video and the colors really stand out, especially during the flight to Neverland.<br /><br />The extras are where the DVD falls flat. No audio commentary, which I feel really would have been nice for such a fantastically visually represented film. Instead, there are about 25 very short video featurettes, averaging 1-2 minutes in length. While interesting, they're all just crammed in there, with no real organization. Some featurettes are organized under the \\"Captain Hook\\" or \\"Neverland Forest\\" section, but then have nothing really to do with these and are basically just a bunch of behind the scenes clips. I think they definitely should have spent some more time with this and organized 5 or 6 decent featurettes in a cohesive manner rather than throw a bunch of small clips on there to make it look like there were more extras.<br /><br />Overall, I wouldn't say this is a bad movie, and most likely it will be enjoyed by a younger audience. However, it failed to catch my attention as an adult, and it seems like this is something that could have been accomplished with a few small changes and different casting decisions. The original DVD release presents a beautiful transfer of the film, but if you really enjoyed this movie, I'd lobby for a better edition than the one they currently have out.an excellent audio and video transfer to disc.

B0002I831S|5.0|This was an awesome gift for my wife who is a big trekky from way back. Actually, It is I who remember the Captain & Spock during the original broadcasts. She was too young, but when she saw them for the first time (during repeats) thought they where new, and became hooked. This DVD collection really is cool! We play them on our Sony DVD player and enjoy the exploits of the orginal Star Trek team in action all over again. What a great gift. I know, because my wife reminds me all of the time how much she really enjoys it. The price is right too! Target sells this item for much more then Amazon. I say get it while you can. If your a true TOS fan, you will by all means love this product.  <br />  <br />
B0000DZEA1|5.0|While I would give a 5 rating to all of the Lord of the Rings soundtracks, if I could, I would give Return of the King a 10. This is, without a doubt, the best film soundtrack I have ever heard. Howard Shore has fulfilled my two main requirements for a good soundtrack; a) It reminds you of the film b) It can stand on it's own.<br /><br />Even after just a few listenings of it, and one viewing of the film, I can instantly recall scenes from the movie after hearing certain tracks. From the sweeping landscapes reminiscent of \\"Hope and Memory,\\" to the sense of urgency during \\"Ride of the Rohirim.\\" The second part of this CD is that, even having never seen the film, you could enjoy this soundtrack. Many soundtracks I enjoy because they have a title theme that is familiar or that was used a lot during the trailers and it reminds me of the movie. However, \\"Return of the King\\" is so powerful that almost all of the tracks could be performed independently of the film and I would enjoy them. I love the \\"pirates of the Caribbean\\" soundtrack, but I doubt I would like it as much if I hadn't seen the film. Shore's soundtrack also has two vocal pieces. \\"Into the West\\" by Annie Lennox took a few listens to get used to, but now it is one of my favorite tracks. \\"The Steward of Gondor\\" features a somewhat awkward vocal performance by Billy Boyd as Pippin, but it also grew on me.<br /><br />This score is so powerful I almost enjoy it more than the film. Even if you're not a fan of film soundtracks, I would encourage anyone who is a fan of the films to pick up the soundtracks for \\"The Two Towers,\\" and definitely this one.

038551123X|2.0|DDD is an interesting novel.  Our main character is not a police officer wrangling against prejudiced superiors and nasty street thugs to find the criminal--he's a criminal himself.  As a criminal, his Camus-like approach to life and relationships make this character hard to like and believe.  Lindsay clearly has a knack for comedy and sarcasm, and Dexter is a perfect voice to add color to an otherwise shallow plot. <br /> <br />The other characters are very flat and trite.  The plot doesn't really work, and there's a touch of made-for-TV twists in the story that make the reader a bit embarrassed that Lindsay didn't think this one through more thoroughly.  I won't be likely to read the next installment in the series.
B00003CXCT|5.0|The greatest sci fi trilogy ever told is finally here and is well worth the money. George Lucas takes you on the fantastic adventure in a galaxy far far away. Fans on this epic trilogy will not be dissapointed with this DVD. It is kind of too bad that Lucas added more special effects and scenes to make it better. There is no need to put the new special effects in it. The special effects of the 70's and 80's movies is what made the films so great. By adding those scenes he is taking all the magic away from the original film. They should release the originals on a new DVD. The special fetures are awsome and will not dissapoint. You get in depth looks at the makings of all 3 films and much more documentaries featuring the cast of these great films. If this collection was cool just image what it will be like when they release episodes 1,2,and 3 together.
1401301010|5.0|This book is probably the best rock memoir I've ever read.  Anthony Kiedis has been there and done it all and came back to tell the story.  As for the tempest on the Stern show, that was all shtick -- Ratso, Anthony's collaborator also co-wrote Howard's two huge books.  Anthony was being coy about the number of women that he slept with so Howard joked that he didn't read the book.  It's obvious that Ratso and Anthony spent a lot of time on this work, and it's amazing how detailed Anthony's memory is given all the illicit substances he's consumed.  What's great is you get a real sense of the origins and motivation behind some of the Chili Peppers most famous songs.  And Anthony is not at all shy to discuss his love life too!  But what's really moving to me is the last third of the book where he finally confronts his demons and comes to terms with his addiction.  By the end of the book, I just wanted to give Anthony a big hug and thank him for all the great music and lyrics he's created.  Buy this book, it rocks as hard as the Peppers do!
B000002ADT|5.0|Every once in a while, we the general public get it right. Ask a small child who is the best basketball player ever and he will tell you Micheal Jordan. Ask a Jazz lover that question about jazz albums and the answer will be Kind of Blue. Miles Davis could not have left our world without recording this masterpiece.  I have been listening to this album every Saturday morning for the past twelve years and every Saturday I am fascinated by \\"Blue in Green\\" and I`m almost brought to tears from the beauty of \\"Flamenco Sketches.\\" Miles Davis assembled this amazing group of musicians including John Coltrane and Bill Evans and formed in my opinion not only the best Jazz album, but the best album ever recorded in the history of music! Put me on an Island and give me kind of Blue and I`ll be just fine! Enjoy!
0393035158|4.0|I suppose it was just a matter of time before someone would make the case that the same forces that guide terrorism are those behind organized religion. Not the actual beliefs, mind you, but the uncompromising commitment in believing what they say, and this does not bode well for the rest of us. Author Sam Harris takes fundamentalists at their word, as he points out astutely that \\"The men who committed the atrocities of September 11 were ... men of faith -- perfect faith, as it turns out -- and this, it must finally be acknowledged, is a terrible thing to be.\\" Curiously, political observers have often discounted principles of faith, and fundamentalist Christians, much like Islam-inspired terrorist groups, are often viewed as the members of the disenfranchised. Harris views this as a life-threatening mistake, and frankly in our ongoing war against terrorism, no one could possibly disagree.<br /><br />Harris is careful to separate religion from the people who have faith, but he takes dead aim at Islamic militants, who see themselves engaged in a war against infidels, and at Christian fundamentalists, who want to impose their moral views on abortion and sexuality on others. That is not the groundbreaking part of the book. Rather, Harris espouses that faith itself is the source of all ill in the world and that we need to live in a world of scientific reason. A key part of his controversial argument is the condemnation of moderate religion, which Harris sees as feeding into the extreme beliefs that lead to mass destruction. He does not appear to condone suppressing religion, a key nuance that needs to be stressed to anyone alienated by the book's theme. Though somewhat oblique about it, Harris does support the belief that life has a spiritual dimension. However, he feels religion should be accessible to scientific study, and that will most certainly raise the ire of the religious right.<br /><br />I like Harris' daring in tackling this seemingly indefensible subject, but since he is not a theologian, the book is not without simplistic logic and incomplete study. For instance, he strongly argues that believers of every denomination constantly engage in civil wars that have produced the Inquisition and the anti-Semitism that resulted in the Holocaust. While true to a degree, one needs to understand the political climate that contributed to such atrocities to get a complete picture of how these abominations occurred. His views on Hindu and Buddhist meditation practices as the basis of ethical foundation are interesting, but ironically contrary to his arguments, there is little scientific evidence to back up his claims yet. What Harris is great at is developing hypotheses worthy of healthy discussion. If we could truly follow his line of logic, I have no doubt the world would be a better place. This is smart reading...expect to be challenged.but since he is not a theologian, the book is not without simplistic logic and incomplete study.

B00004TLN3|2.0|I watched this movie because I am a Jane Austen fan, however I found that this version did not do the novel justice.  The director took a great deal of \\"artistic license\\", of which none was for the best.  I found the acting only mediocre and as I wrote before, the \\"artistic license\\" taken was for the deprivation of the movie.  The scenery was, for the credit of the movie, beautiful.  However, while reading the novel, I viewed both the characters and the surroundings in a much different light.  Overall, I would not recommend this movie - I would however, with high regard recommend the book to you.
B0001LJC2K|5.0|I first heard Muse on a friend's mix  - and I thought I had found a lost Jeff Buckley tune! My friend didn't remember the name of the band, but I quickly found them out and bought Absolution. I've been addicted ever since. The Radiohead comparisons are fair, especially to The Bends - which is good news by me. But there' s lots of variety on the album too. Time Is Running Out, Butterflies & Hurricanes, Apocolyse Please - all very different, very cool songs. Definitely worth checking out. <br />
B00024I31C|3.0|Some nice melodies and guitar playing but I was expecting more based upon all the 4-5 star reviews.  On many if not most of the songs I can barely hear him singing.
B00005JN4F|4.0|Jimmy Fallon is a cop who is such a bad driver he loses his license. Queen Latifah is a cab driver with a souped up Taxi who is a great driver. When Fallon comandeers Latifah's cab to stop a bank robbery,  vehicular mayhem and fun break out! Add to the mix the fact the bank robbers are Brazillian Super Models and you have a surreal good time for all! <br />    Ignore the critics who have cut this movie to shreds. Its pure escapist fun that rates four stars. Enjoy!
068987474X|4.0|There is a chapter in The Rules II called \\"If he doesn't call, he's not that interested.  Period!\\"  Sound familiar?  Ellen Fein and Sherrie Schneider have been trying to get women to understand this since 1995.  If you've been afraid to read The Rules because you don't like the way it sounds, you \\"don't want to play games,\\" you think it's old-fashioned, or whatever other excuses you have, try it.  If you like this book, you will like The Rules.  However, if you need trendy lingo and hip sayings to believe that men who are really interested will pursue you, then please, read this book forty times.
0062502182|5.0|Just a poetically told simple fable for mystics about a boy who has a dream and goes off to the Pyramids in Egypt to seek treasure.  The usual truisms of spiritual evolution are presented - listening to the inner voice and when the student is ready the guide will appear.  Just a very short book as beautiful and easy to read as a fairy tale. <br /> <br />So how about the negative reviews?  Not that there are negative reviews, of course any book is as easy to dislike as to like, but the sheer hatred expressed by some reviewers, both for this book and for the type of people who would enjoy this book really blows me away.  Some people do not even grasp metaphor, for instance that the buried treasure is not actually material but only a symbol like buried treasure in any fairy tale.   <br /> <br />This book is not a spiritual guide - personally I believe no one can be \\"guided\\" into spirituality, it is something that must awaken from within or not at all - it is only what it professes to be on the cover \\"a fable about following your dream\\".  Don't take the whole thing so seriously. <br /> <br />
B0000256VK|5.0|I've listened to this album non stop for 20 years and will never grow tired of it. I know that it might be one of those time and place type albums, but even when I play this at work, my students ask who it is. This was Bryan Ferry and company in top form, never again to be duplicated. I can't say anything that hasn't been said about it. Pick it up and call it a night.
B00000JR29|4.0|I have enjoyed this album for many years and highly recommend it, It's best tracks appart from the main hit: \\"Everybody Wants to Rule the World\\", you also have a good moody somewhat pensive \\"The Working Hour\\", the uptempo love ballad \\"Head Over Heels\\", \\"Shout\\", another good track though somewhat of an acquired taste \\"I Believe\\". As I put in my review title I feel it's one of the essential TFF albums along with \\"The Hurting\\" and the pre-break up \\"Tears Roll Down\\" second album mentioned being a greatest hits anthology of pre break up TFF.
B0001BS4Q0|5.0|Colour the Small One, the follow up to Healing is difficult, is a refreshing change of pace. This album explores more of Sia's downtempo R & B side. The album has a more organic sound to it instead of the digital production on Healing. It's a album full of growing,pain,love,and optimism. If you enjoyed her work on Zero 7's When it falls, then this is one to pick up. It's worth the import price.
B0000C8AVE|5.0|This was Bob Dylan's first great album, among many.  Here is where he established himself as a great, original songwriter.  He was also an original as a singer, to say the least.  Most of the tracks here are Bob solo, accompanying himself on acoustic guitar and harmonica (\\"Corrina, Corrina\\" has a full band, and a couple of other songs have a second guitar).  The whole thing works beautifully, and the album has become a recognized folk classic.  Highly recommended.
B0001I561E|4.0|Aladdin would not have been what it is without the talented Robin Williams.  The songs ARE great and the story is good, but it still retains a bit of the Saturday-morning-cartoon feel, mainly because of the voice acting which is a bit overdone.  The other classics that preceded this one, like The Little Mermaid and Beauty and the Beast still seem a cut above.  Otherwise, this is a great movie with a good message to kids and adults alike.  Also, if you're someone who watches all of the special features on DVD's there are some good bonuses which give a real inside look into what it takes to make an animated film and some insights into what the movie could have been including an original plot line that included Aladdin's mother, a few deleted songs and a heartfelt reminder of the tragic loss of song-writer Howard Ashman, who, along with Alan Menken was basically responsible for the resurgence of the animated musical.  All in all, this is a great DVD if you are a fan of the film or of animated musicals in general.
B000002LHT|3.0|This album marked the return of Marky Ramone to the Ramones.  It also was Dee Dee Ramone's last album with the group.  And their last studio album for Sire Records.  The album is pretty good, overall.  It can't measure up to their earlier albums, but how could it?  There are good songs here, but only two true Ramones \\"classics\\" (\\"I Believe in Miracles\\" and \\"Pet Sematary\\").  Although the Christmas song is a near classic.  Ramones fans should enjoy this album.
B0001Z37HM|2.0|The supporting role from good 'ol Ah-nold is enough to watch Red Sonja, a film made after the equally lame Conan the Destroyer (that film and this are were both directed by Richard Fleischer), and the real kicker here folks: even though Red Sonja takes place in the world of pulp author Robert E. Howard, Arnold doesn't play the warrior king that made him famous.  If you can get past that, there actually are a few redeeming qualities, such as the casting of Brigitte Nielsen as Sonja, who physically is perfect for the role.  She faces off against an evil empress (Sandahl Bergman, from Conan the Barbarian) seeking revenge with help from good 'ol Ah-nold.  Even though this was made in 1985 and the excellent Conan the Barbarian was made in 1982, it's amazing how Conan has aged gracefully and this hasn't aged well at all.  Red Sonja was lame then, and it's still lame now, so if you've never seen it, you're not missing much, and are better off sticking with your Conan the Barbarian DVD.
B00000DG1R|5.0|Not only were the Fab Five awesome in the 80's, but what band could get together after their last album (21 years ago)and get together and record another kick-ass album and you know it will be good, because they are Duran Duran.  That is why they rule!!!So girls and guys (you know you like them too), get the hairspray, lipgloss and our John Taylor hats and lets scream like we were mushy 12-year olds.
B000274THQ|5.0|Finally, a film that satisfied a lifelong curiosity I've had for people my age who lived on the other side of the Iron Curtain.  Since elementary school, I always wondered what it was like for kids like me who were unfortunate to be born in the Soviet Union or East Germany, two of the harshest communist states.  This curiosity led to my checking out books on the topic and reading about it, and being called a \\"commie\\" by my fellow Americans, as if curiosity about someone our government tells us is \\"our enemy\\" makes me one of them! <br /> <br />I was thrilled when I read a movie like this had come out, showing life in the last days of East Germany and the euphoria of a new world opening up for people who pretty much lived in a prison all their lives.  Of course, the initial rush of euphoria in newfound freedom left a harsh wake up call as differences in work ethics, standards of living, and cultural references became more and more apparent after reunification of the two Germanys.  In personal terms, think of what it would be like if separated twins discovered each other late in life...one a Wall Street stockbroker, the other a trailer park living low wage slave.  A clash in more ways than one, right? <br /> <br />The performances of Daniel Bruhl as the idealistic son and of Katrin Sass as the mother who always believed in Marxism, both performances really stand out and are Oscar-worthy.  The lengths the son goes to, to prevent his mother from falling into another coma over the shock of the demise of East Germany provides much of the humor.  My favorite scene is when the mother, tired of being cooped up in the bedroom, decides to go for a walk outside and its like walking through Wonderland for her.  The look of complete bafflement on her face as she watches a statue of Lenin fly through the air, in a salutatory departure, is pure joy to watch.  Just her look alone perfectly conveys the confusion of a world being turned upside down. <br /> <br />This film addresses theissue of \\"Ostalgie\\" that has gripped some former East Germans in the late 1990s as they have found that the materialism of the West hasn't replaced a sense of community for them.  Under the iron fisted rule of Honecker, they might not have had much, but they suffered together and had a genuine sense of community...although any one of their neighbors could have turned them in to the state for any number of \\"violations.\\"  Watching this film, one can see the draw of culture on a person and the void left behind when the culture is stripped away or proven false.  Does longing for the familiar products of one's youth actually mean a desire to return to the way things were?  I don't think so...but culture is something we'll always carry with us.  It's who we are. <br /> <br />The brilliance of this film for me, is that we get to look at East Germans as people with no control over their form of government.  In America, we were taught that the Russians and Eastern Europeans were our \\"enemies\\" and a lot of people bought into it.  But in reality, they are people just like us.  People who believe their government over a foreign government they're not familiar with.  Are we any different?  I like that this film shows an idealistic young East German and his yearning for freedom, idolizing a Cosmonaut, and who loves his mother so much that he dares not tell her the truth about what happened to their country since she fell into and out of a coma.  This deception strains his relations with his sister, but provides much humorous situations before reaching a satisfying conclusion.  I have no complaints about this film.  It's flawless and brilliant.  The acting and humor are first rate and Oscar-worthy.  I would rate \\"Goodbye Lenin!\\" as the best film I've seen so far in 2004.
B0002OERI0|3.0|Dont get me wrong, Green day has been one of my favorites since Dookie in 94, however, like many self proclaimed punk rock bands they have fallen to the status of sellouts. You may ask yourself why the views and look of the band have taken a sudden drastic change in views: The make up, the patronization of 'American idiots' are all tending to the needs of the next generation teenagers who are so suddenly intrigued by politics because of the upcoming presidential race and the war in Iraq, and the new look of the \\"punk rebel\\"...as seen on AFI and several other bands. Im not saying this isnt a good album, it is, but dont judge green day on this if its your first time.
0316666343|4.0|This novel captured my attention for being on the best seller lists for months, and if I recall correctly, was the best selling novel of 2003.  That it sold extremely well must be a sign of the current zeitgeist for metaphysical topics in films and books, quite possibly a healing balm in the post 9/11 months. <br /> <br />I loved how this novel portrays life from the eyes of a teenage girl who was murdered by a serial killer, as she watches her family and friends cope with the grief and acceptance of her death.  There were some implausibles, though I had heard something before about marriages breaking up after the death of a child.  I don't understand that phenomenon, but this novel seems to follow that line of thinking.  There are some gruesome bits, mostly in showing the deceptive nature of the serial killer and what a cold blooded liar he is to the police and neighbors.  Susie Salmon's death isn't spared the gruesome horror, and I found myself a bit squeemish just reading those parts of the novel. <br /> <br />I was hoping that this novel would show more of what goes on in heaven.  We are given fleeting images, but nothing to captivate our imaginations (unlike, say, \\"What Dreams May Come\\" by Richard Matheson...the best novel about the afterlife I've ever read).  Instead, we see a girl obsessed or attached with earth, watching over everything.  The novel works towards a cheesy development in which Susie is miraculously given a chance to do what she wanted to do before dying, which was losing her virginity, apparently.  This scene in the novel reminded me of the film \\"Ghost\\" when Whoopi Goldberg allows Patrick Swayze's soul to enter her body for a little dance with Demi Moore.  A bit cheesy, but it didn't really detract from the novel for me.  The ending is what saved the novel for me, with its clever resolution regarding the serial killer.  That's what I give the fourth star for.  This novel would have gotten five stars from me if the writer had shown more of whathappens to Susie in heaven...something like a life review, meeting other souls she knew on earth, exploring options for what she'll do for the rest of eternity, that sort of thing.  Perhaps that's not what the writer had in mind, but this novel was a good, entertaining read with just enough horror to raise my adrenaline and enough sweet moments to smile about.

B000050IMH|1.0|it is very stupid and gross.they rip off other horror films and think theyre funny.theyre really not.nobody important is in it.the kids should not be exposed to the disgusting bull portrayed here.the money was probably really tight on this one.theres no point in going on about which one was better than the next because theyre all equaly worthless.maybe all the money the fooled america into paying for thier tickets paid for the next 2.theres a few sexy chicks around but theyre all dorks.i think everybody in this movie is obnoxious.the hype is wrong!this sucks!
068987474X|5.0|When you're a young, proactive, busy woman you don't want to wait for someone to get off their butt to call you for a date. Woman are efficient and practical. We'd prefer to get the ball rolling. Think about what we are doing. We are ignoring the fact that these guys aren't into us. We can't believe such a thing. In this way, the author is wrong. He says some woman have low self-esteem and that's why we let guys walk all over us. I think we have high self-esteem and that's why we refuse to believe certain men aren't into us. Nevertheless, I don't have to make the effort to go out with a guy. I don't have to do anymore work. If he likes me, he'll call. This is the most liberating book you will ever read.

B00005JM0B|4.0|The striking thing about this film is how it works on so many different levels. The action sequences are phenomenal and the suspense is genuine. We assumed that seeing for a third time a Terminator chasing its prey around Los Angeles like some sort of mechanical Jason Vorhees would be tedious and hold no new surprises. Delightfully, we couldn't have been more wrong if we were horny teenagers at summer camp sneaking off by ourselves to go swimming in Crystal Lake telling our friends, \\"we'll be right back.\\" The initial chase scene is so suspenseful we actually found ourselves holding our breath. <br /> <br />There are also some great concepts to ponder. The creators present us with ideas of fate, destiny and the inevitability of our own destruction in the tradition of mid-twentieth century speculative fiction. Ragnarok is unavoidable, no matter how hard a man, a society or a civilization tries to prevent it.  <br /> <br />If you are a fan of the original films, then T3 will not disappoint you. Viewers get to witness the exact nanosecond when the machines rise up against humanity. The proto-type T-1 robots look authentically like something designed by humans and demonstrate how much more technologically advanced the Terminators will become. The creative minds behind this element did their homework and should be praised for the effect created. This film is no mere exploitative sequel. It adds a rich dimension to the John Connor saga and ends in such a way as to make us eager to see additional installments. This is a spectacular feat for the third film in a trilogy. Are you paying attention Mssrs.

B00005NTP2|4.0|On this album, EUROPE are trying their best to imitate BON JOVI <br />and do succeed! <br /> <br />The best song is \\"I'll cry for you\\" , quite awesome. <br /> <br />More pop oriented than the other albums, Kee Marcello's guitar work is dismal on this unlike the previous album \\"Out of this world\\" <br /> <br /> <br />
6305807930|5.0|Inferno is another one of Argento's stabs at the supernatural.  It's kind of a semi-sequel to Suspiria.  Basically we got the three evil mothers that rule the world from their homes.  One's in Italy, one's in New York(of course) and one's in Germany.  A couple of characters stumble upon this fact through a rare book and look to figure it out.  But basically anyone who gets nosy or near that damn book is slaughtered.  That's the bare bones plot for the film, but it's not so much the plot that makes this so fun to watch, but the style, and we all know how good Argento is with style.  Alot of people claim this film makes no sense, but I don't see why they think that.  Hell, I just told you the plot.  I think people find it confusing coz of the bizarre characters and situations that arise(the hotdog vendor thing is one of the funniest things I've ever seen in a film.  I hope Dario wanted that to be funny).  But all these you can put down to witchy hocus pocus.  I'd strongly suggest watching this if you liked Suspiria.  It's gory, very colorful, bizarre and downright trippy.  And lets not forget that funky soundtrack by Keith Emerson(Da Da Do Dee Do Dee Do Dee Suspiriorum! Da Da Lachrymarum! Da Da Tenebrarum! Da Da Do Dee Do Dee Do Dee Do Dee Da Da Watch Your Step! Watch Your Step! Watch Your Step!).  Watch it if you know what's good for you
B000078DOI|5.0|Before \\"By the Way\\".  Before \\"Californication\\".  Even before \\"Blood, Sugar, Sex, Magik\\"; \\"Mother's Milk\\" was, and is, the definitive work of the Red Hot Chili Peppers.  Featuring the debut of guitarist John Frusciante, \\"Mother's Milk\\" finds the band at their funky best.  Anthony Kiedis' vitrolic vocals are amazingly intense and in your face, while Flea's bass work must be heard to be believed.  Opening track \\"Good Time Boys\\", the classic cover of Stevie Wonder's \\"Higher Ground\\", \\"Magic Johnson\\", \\"Knock Me Down\\", the amazing cover of the Jimi Hendrix classic \\"Fire\\", and \\"Sexy Mexican Maid\\" are all time classics that longtime fans of the Peppers know and love.  If you don't already own this album, now has never been a better time as it is now remastered (and sounding better than ever) and it includes a plethora of bonus live tracks.
B000000WHC|5.0|Wow... lights, camera, action... Talk about a screaming Les Paul induced set of tracks!  Solid musicianship, just plain over the top. If this release was a bar hog, it would still be a screamer... top shelf. I turned my grunge rock nephew on to it and he really found nirvana....
B0002IU988|5.0|I basically bought this CD because I've been starved for any new Creed music and I was curious to hear what Creed sounds like without Scott Stapp.  Honestly, I didn't think I would like it and began listening to the CD with a biased ear, knowing I would hate it because Scott was gone.  No one was more surprised than myself to find that it is a GREAT CD and NOT because it sounds like Creed.  \\"One Day Remains\\" is moving and rocking and Alter Bridge has its own sound and while some of the music occasionally reminds me of Creed, the combination of Myles Kennedy's powerful voice and Mark Tremonti's kick-butt guitar playing  will have Alter Bridge forging their own way in a very short time.  I will forever love and miss Creed and wish Scott Stapp every success as a solo artist, but Alter Bridge has a new fan!
B00005JMJG|4.0|Don't let the lofty and tongue-tasking title put you off with this movie.  The movie's strength lies in its originality and creativity, two elements much needs in film.  This movie has screenwriter Charlie Kaufman written all over it.  You will find the elements of \\"Being John Malkovich,\\" threaded throughout.  Especially in the area of the suspense of reality in order to tell an internal tale of human motivation and ultimately love.<br /><br />The title is a quote from Alexander Pope (or Pope, Alexander depending on how you look at it), \\"How happy is the blameless Vestal's lot! / The world forgetting, by the world forgot / Eternal sunshine of the spotless mind! / Each pray'r accepted, and each wish resign'd.\\"<br /><br />John Carrey and Kate Winslet turn in great performances as two polar opposites that find themselves destined to be together despite the difficulty of learning to live so closely with another person (a person you won't always agree with, be treated nice by, be nice to, etcetera, etcetera...but a person you love just the same).  They find themselves still drawn together despite selective amnesia.  The film takes a while to develop and the viewer finds himself waded around through Carrey's character's unconscious mind as he seeks to hold on to the one thing that matters to him in life...the love of a completely impulsive alcoholic (go figure).<br /><br />In the end you might find the non-linear approach to be off-putting, or the subject matter to be too much on the \\"deep\\" side, but you will find it boils down to a drama about how lives are intertwined in mutual attraction and love, despite all reason, despite all logic, sometimes despite self-preservation.  The heart trumps the mind once again in matters that last, in matters of life choices.  That's what I'm talking about.  That's what Kaufman is trying to say with \\"Eternal Sunshine.\\"  Proceed with caution, realizing this might not be a film for everyone.<br /><br />--MMW
B0000JD24W|4.0|this nam vet comes back to the world and is treated like crap.hes arrested for no real reason and beat by cops.he has a flashback and messes up the whole batch of them and goes off into the woods.what results from this is a cop massacre.he tries to get away but they wont stop.its one of the best action movies ever.it redefined the term action when it was released.sly stallone plays john rambo,in his best role ever!the kids will probably not sleep well after viewing this one.its the best of the trilogy.any action lover will love this one.the squeamish and the wussy probably wont.the emerging pattern is dead cops!there are some emotional parts where rambo gets upset about his time in nam.i dont think theres even any chicks in this movie.theres advantages to that,like not having to listen to them whine all time.rambo gave the performance of his career.i dont think theyll make anymore of these but one between part 1 and 2 where hes in prison would be cool and a prequel to the first one all about nam.all you need is a crazy-violent-musclehead-with black hair and that looks similar to stallone about the face.so do it already!
B0000256VK|1.0|I bought this after I fell in love with Country Life and read all these reviews raving about this piece of junk.  This album is so boring that I've been using to ween myself off Tylenol PM.  Skip this and head straight for the earlier stuff.

B00005JNEI|4.0|First, let me say I'm disappointed in those of you judging this movie without actually watching it first...my father being one of them. The topic of this film isn't fiction. We are a nation at war. September 11th was not a dream. As American citizens we must review ALL sides before drawing any conclusions. With Moore's film, we as the American public get to see a side of these travesties not covered by the media. (...) There was too much footage of September 11th and the present War in Iraq of the dying soldiers, wounded soldiers, Iraqi women and children, and families from both Iraq and America. If you laughed, that's disgusting because no matter how you feel about Bush, you have to give those people some respect. A good friend of mine is presently serving in Iraq. She's 27 and has 2 children. She also 3 siblings also in the military and 2 of which are also in Iraq. This is a REAL war for some of us and I encourage everyone to please keep an open mind when watching this film. I did subtract a star in my rating simply because I did feel that Michael Moore did unnecessarily bash Bush in a couple of moments by taking what he said out of context. I'm not even a Bush supporter and I will admit to that. I also think to some more easily influenced, it will give a false impression that Bush is somehow in favor of this war for profit or just trying to cover his own butt. I don't buy that at all. I really think HE believes he's doing the right thing for the better cause of the USA and for the rest of the world, but just because he thinks he's right, doesn't make him right.<br /><br />I think many people oppose this film because they are afraid of not necessarily the \\"truth\\" but because it WILL make you think. We're used to being told what we should think and when you watch this film, even if you still support Bush in the end, I know that for at least a moment, you WILL question what's going on in this country. It obviously impacted enough people to come on here and write a review. It obviously impacted enough corporate  giants and politicians to try and steer the public from seeing this film. At least open your minds and watch it.It obviously impacted enough corporate  giants and politicians to try and steer the public from seeing this film. At least open your minds and watch it.
B000002GBK|4.0|It was 1977 when I was first introduced to Rick Wakeman by a fellow roomate, himself a musician, and was able to appreciate the keyboard work that only Wakeman was demonstrating at that time.  Even today I can appreciate the innovative style that has become Rick Wakeman's signature.  Wakeman has that unique ability to tell a story using music, with the focus on keyboard and synthesizer and orchestral backgrounds, to project colourful visuals into the listener's mind.  This album stands as his best work, even above &quot;Journey to the Center of the Earth&quot;, which is still hugely entertaining.  The album is not perfect, as I am still a bit taken aback by Wakeman's vocals and thus the 4 star rating. That said, it is a classic that has stood the test of time.  It was a DVD that I had to have.
B00005KFUM|5.0|Get your hands on this album right away. the reason being, well if you've heard absolution and like it then there is no reason you should'nt own this, because it's a complete tie with how good absolution is. IF you don't own any muse or are curious about this album, it is a deffinate must have because it feels a little darker than absolution, and a little harder, yet very intellegent and classy. The lead singer ( who by the way plays both the guitar and the piano ) is such an incredible artist that even if you don't like rock than you should still hear him. Give this a try , and listen to it over and over . I don't know why you wouldn't but... yes,,,, Get it sooooon!!
B000002UAU|5.0|One of the great rock albums of all time. But........... <br />There is one thing I can't understand and I could have said this reviewing any of The Beatles work, Why Hasn't anything been done to upgrade the Beatles catalog? Dylan's work was released on SACD this year. The Stones likewise. It is hightime that the Beatles catalog got the treatment it so richly deserves.
B0001LJC2K|5.0|Like the title explains, this album is dear. Although i am currently out of the rock faze at the moment, i used to listen to this cd , and uhhh that was all i listened to. I never really took it out of my car's cd player for about 3 months. You may think that a little sad, but it's not. The reason it's not is because the lead singer has brilliant vocals, brilliant lyrics  that are intellegent. this cd also isn't just all the same type of songs. it feels like They go through different types of rock expanding their horrizons to entertain to any extent. If for some reason you don't own this album i suggest it to an extreme that you buy it. And please listen to it at least until you can nearly sing along with the tracks. And then try and tell me you don't have an extreme love for the british band Muse that so few americans know of!
B00005JNEI|5.0|Do we think we are above third world politics?  Well, see this movie and think otherwise.  See how we have allowed a rich, powerful family control the destiny of our country.  Let us examine ourselves - it can be difficult to look in the mirror and see what we see.
B00005JN4F|4.0|I went in to Taxi not expecting too much. I figured it would be one of those buddy/cop comedies that rehash everything that's been done in every other movie in the genre and all the good parts were in the commercial. But, Rush Hour 2 and Starsky And Hutch (both buddy cop comedies) were good, and I had low expectations for those too. So into the theatre I went. Boy was I wrong about Taxi.    Although my assumptions proved to be right for the first 15 minutes, the last hour and 25 minutes proved me wrong. Latifah (who I always enjoy) and Jimmy Fallon (who i've hardly heard of) had wonderful chemistry and sparked this fun ride of a movie. Also, with the beautiful bank robbers and the stunning Jennifer Esposito, and not to mention Christian Kane in a miniscule role, made this movie amazing. After the first 15 minutes of Falloon being an idiot ended, this was a pleasurable movie that had an amazing selection of both action and gut bursting comedy. If you want to have a wonderful time tonight, see this movie. You won't be dissapointed.
B00005JNEI|5.0|There are so many reasons why Fahrenheit 9/11 is a must-see movie, but #1 for me what how it convincingly and honestly demonstrated that Bush is not a good leader. If you agree, buy a couple DVDs from Amazon and send them to libraries in battleground states. More people need to watch this film.
B000066C6Z|5.0|Much of the humor in the Zucker/Abraham/Zucker movies is found in the background.  While you may be focused on what's going on up front, look at some of the things going on in the background.  One of my favorites in this one is in the pizzaria.  Val Kilmer and Lucy Gutteridge are having a serious confrontation while in the background, pizza eaters are having a hard time getting the pizza off because the cheese is sooo stringy!  It's prime example of the off the wall humor.<br /><br />While TOP SECRET is sluggish compared to the AIRPLANE and NAKED GUN series, it is nonetheless funny most of the time.  For those of us who remember the exploding Pinto crisis, the scene in which the Germans ping the Pinto is priceless.  Christopher Villiers as the Torch has a sly moment when masquerading as a cow, a bull sort of gooses him.  There's lot of sight gags and some really silly production numbers, but Kilmer and the gang, including an uncredited Omar Sharif, seem to be having fun.  It's fun to watch.
B0001ADAVK|1.0|Although this movie had lovely music and a beautiful (but unrealistic) view of the '50's, the creators got it all wrong. Katherine Watson comes to an all-womans college as if she stepped out of the future. She fights against the idealism of the '50's that woman should not further their education after getting married; that all woman want or need in life is a husband and kids. The whole basis of her beliefs was that it was \\"wrong\\", when in reality that was only the culture. How she behaved was as someone growing up in our time would, while this was still considered wrong in the time period of the 1950's.
B000069AUI|5.0|Oh my God I love Coldplay. The are one of the greatest band that has been out in a really long time.  They write really great music and every song that they write is great, not a bad one on the whole album!!!  There are some great songs on the album like \\"Clocks\\",\\"In My Place\\" and \\"Rush of Blood to the Head\\". They are like a new  version of U2 and there is a hell of alot to be said for that. Chris Martin has a cool voice, he is like the English version of Bono!!!=) I love these guys and I hope that they put a new alobum out soon!!!!=p
B00005JNEU|3.0|Based on the book of the same name, Friday Night Lights is an honorable addition to sports movies.  To say that the fans of Permian high school in Odessa, in west Texas, live for their team could be the understatement of the year.  It makes for a ton of pressure on 17 year old boys, but then, none of these \\"boys\\" look anywhere near 17, a standard Hollywood problem with teenage character movies.   <br /> <br />The movie runs around two hours; you don't notice the time, a very good indicator.  It has excellent cinematography, including some superb setting shots that wonderfully capture the vast emptiness of West Texas.  Billy Bob Thornton as the coach is as good as I've seen him and singer Tim McGraw as the bullying father of one player launches a second career.  The football action, particularly the close-up tackling, approaches NFL highlights for realism.   <br /> <br />On the other hand, there are problems besides the overaged \\"boys.\\"  Some of the story lines get pretty short shrift.  For example, I never did figure out just exactly what the weirdness was with the quarterback's mother, failing health? kind of wacko?, who knows? And Permian's opponents in the state championship are painted in such ridiculous villain colors that it virtually invites the audience to hiss.  <br /> <br />While not nearly as good as its thematic cousins Hoosiers and Remember the Titans, Friday Night Lights is still definitely worth one of your own Friday nights.
0553212621|3.0|\\"Lady Chatterley's Lover\\" is, I suppose, D.H. Lawrence's most famous novel, which is a shame because compared to his earlier masterpieces \\"Sons and Lovers,\\" \\"The Rainbow,\\" and \\"Women in Love\\" it's really not very good.  It achieved its fame as one of the most censored novels in history, and the legal battles for its completely unexpurgated publication continued for decades after Lawrence's death in 1930.  As far as I can tell, the censorship was caused not so much by the subject--the extramarital affairs of a woman trapped in a celibate marriage--but by the explicitly erotic scenes of sexual intercourse and especially the language, which were very daring for the time.   <br /> <br />Lawrence sets the stage portentously on the very first page by introducing Lady Connie Chatterley's husband, the baronet Sir Clifford, as having been wounded serving in World War I, paralyzed from the waist down and confined to a wheelchair for the rest of his life.  With this limiting premise, in what direction could the story go other than Connie's quest to fulfill her need for a sexual relationship?  She turns her romantic attention first to an unromantic Irish playwright named Michaelis and then to Clifford's gamekeeper, Oliver Mellors, who is separated from a jealous, neurotic wife, while Lawrence describes the sexual encounters with considerable poetic panache.  Lawrence labors nobly to make these characters interesting, but they never seem like more than cardboard cutouts of the fuller figures he so richly developed in his three major novels.  They are simple people with simple thoughts and desires; their conversations are dreadfully boring.   <br /> <br />It is surprising for a novel of such risque reputation to contain almost no surprises, but there are a few notable moments, most of which unfortunately serve to illustrate Clifford's impotence in more areas than just sexual.  His wheelchair is motorized, and when one day while on a walk the motor fails and Connie and Mellors have to struggle to push him up a hill, Clifford fumes at his helplessness, his mobility at the mercy of others.  This is a long, agonizing scene which seems intended to make the reader uncomfortable by cruelly emphasizing the disparity in power between the two men in Connie's life, the wealthy paraplegic and the poor but ambulatory stud.  Could Lawrence have been less subtle?  Did he feel, two thirds of the way into the novel, that his point had not yet been made clearly?  <br /> <br />The narrative also suffers from some carelessly bad prose characterized by awkwardly worded metaphors (\\"The fine flower of their intimacy was to her rather like an orchid, a bulb stuck parasitic on her tree of life, and producing, to her eyes, a rather shabby flower.\\") and extraneous misoneism about the urbanization of post-World War I England caused by increasing industrialization; but I could overlook these flaws if the story had given me something more than a prurient attempt to lament the disintegration of the significance of modern marriage.  What I got was a D.H. Lawrence who was not firing on all cylinders.  The man wrote some great novels, but \\"Lady Chatterley's Lover\\" is not one of them. <br />
B00006F7IM|4.0|I am a big fan of the Major League series, was somewhat disappointed in Major League II, and was very pleasantly surprised by Major League III.  <br /> <br />Here we get a first class baseball story of unlikely heroes, which holds up well with time and repeated viewings. The message is the importance of teamwork and the gelling of a team from some very quirky individuals.

068987474X|5.0|This book is so true but not in a demeaning kind of way. There's no fancy words or elaborate plans for a woman to follow, just the basic truth. It's hard to admit sometimes that guys are simple creatures, but it's true. Instead of sitting around and making excuses for all the losers I encounter on a daily basis, dating and otherwise, I have now set myself free!  <br />The reviews at the end of the chapters are hysterical and I kept finding myself laughing out loud. Face it ladies, we know what we deserve and how we should behave but sometimes we forget. This book will show you the way, and remind you of how exceptional you are. <br />This is my new bible...get the book, lose the deadweight!
B00007ELJX|4.0|You know, nine out of ten times that I show this movie to friends of mine, the reaction is usually pretty much the same: the dude who made that movie is nuts. Well, in all reality, Lynch didn't go nuts, Lynch just goes lynch on \\"Lost Highway\\", easily the most Lynchian of his works since his debut, the surreal \\"Eraserhead\\". <br />Gone are any forms of conventinal storytelling like there were in \\"Blue Velvet\\", \\"Wild At Heart\\" or \\"Twin Peaks: Fire Walk With Me\\", replaced by a surreal landscape where little makes sense and little is supposed to. The film is seperated into two parts: a much darker and intricate story about a jazz musician(Bull Pullman) who is being stalked by a crazy dude in white face(Robert Blake, showing signs of things to come as it were) and who kills his wife(Patricia Arquette). Or maybe he doesn't. I don't know. <br />Then the film shifts focuses(I wont say how because that's one of the crazy things about it) to a car mechanic(Balthazer Getty) who ends up having an affair with a mobster's girlfriend(once again, Patricia Arquette). <br />Now this all seems to be easy to follow and get, but this is just the set up for the movie, where Lynch takes his stab at film noir done by a crazy scientist. The movie seems to be perfectly understandable and normal at one point, but twists and turns so much that even after twenty times viewing, you are still lost. And that's the fun of a David Lynch movie. Everything is left up to your own interpretation of what's going on and what's happening, and not one person is wrong or right. Everyone can see \\"Lost Highway\\" differently. <br />The mood conjured by Lynch and his scorer Angelo Badalmenti is excellent, as it is in many Lynch films, and the modern music supplied by NIN honch(and laziest man in showbiz) Trent Reznor gives the film a modern twist(at least for the time it came out) without taking away from the decidely 40-ish tone that the movie conjures. <br />\\"Lost Highway\\" is a difficult film, and at times is way to dark and insular, even for a David Lynch epic. But its also interesting and myseterious and never treats the audience member like idiots. And that only should make it necessary viewing for film wathcers.
B0002IU988|5.0|For those who think this new CD is inferior to CREED and to current rock acts out there, you have absolutely no concept of what good music is. It is interesting that the harshest critics are those that seem to think Limp Biz is a good band. That being said, from a guitarists perspective this album blows me away. This is the best work Mark has ever done. The vocals are superb, particularly when compared to Scott Stapp, which admittedly isn't hard to accomplish. <br />The songs are technically proficient, with outstanding solos on most tracks. This CD isn't watered down like most Creed tracks were either. The Metallica influence really shows in the solo/song structures. While soft in spots, it truly is hard rock at it's best. I hate to be critical of such a masterpiece, but I would have liked a few more heavy tracks. 5 of the tracks are of the mid to ballad tempo. <br />Best Tracks- Watch Your Words, Open Your Eyes, One Day Remains <br />Worst Track - Shed My Skin
0070511136|5.0|Some sales theory books you can check out at the library to read for inspiration, other sales books are so good you buy them.  This is a book to buy and to take notes.  I had seen this book recommended several times throughout Amazon.  I finally read it after seeing it recommended by Industrial EGO's Shamus Brown [...] .  Usually sales books start with an inspiring success story that the author has experienced; I love the fact that Rackham begins his book with a failure (of sorts) when his firm Huthwaite's first big client discounted his sales analysis findings after trailing their sales reps in the field. It does take some careful concentration to read.  The exercises are helpful and the author tries to inject some humor to shed light on his theories (see Quincy's Rule).  I've just been promoted to strategic sales manager in the technical software field, selling a management platform.  Our item is not a high-dollar item compared to our competitor's, but it does qualify as a larger sale and the sales cycle is usually 90+ days.  I have been consciously trying to mimic the selling behaviors of our top sales reps.  If I'd read this book before I would have been more successful earlier in my sales career.  This along with \\"Selling to VITO\\" by Anthony Parinello and sales training at Industrial EGO Sales are great sales tools to use.
B00003CY5J|2.0|I had high expectations for this movie because first it had my favorite actor Deniro in it and secondly he was acting with Norton who is a good upcoming star. Well I got shutdown. Deniros acting was great but the story was just boring. People say Norton acted good as the mentally challenged person but come on now, I think it'd be pretty easy to play a mentally challenged person. I didnt even think Brando had that good of a part. There no action at all in this movie, none. The only reason I gave it 2 stars was because of the end, and Deniros acting.
B000001ELP|1.0|I think reviews that are hyping this album as a great and underappreciated gem are doing potential KISS fans a disservice. This was the first KISS album I ever bought, and it's a wonder it wasn't the last.  <br /> <br />The Elder is a concept album. Yes, a concept album from KISS. Never a band known for their deep philosophical musings, the guys sat down with Bob Ezrin and based an album around an idea for a movie from Gene about a race of immortals, and a \\"chosen one\\" who has to meet his destiny. Or something to that effect. It doesn't really matter what the concept is, as long as the music is okay, right?  <br /> <br />That's where this album fails miserably. This albums best songs are listenable and okay (The Oath, Dark Light, a World Without Heroes) but when it's bad, it's laughably bad. Songs like \\"Odyssey\\", \\"Mr.Blackwell\\", and the cheesy self-affirming \\"I\\", almost ruined KISS single-handedly. At times, it's so bad I wonder if they actually *tried* to make it sub-par.  <br /> <br />New fans should avoid this album until they are well acquainted with KISS' GREAT albums from the 70s, starting with stuff like \\"Dressed to Kill\\" and \\"Destroyer\\". The Elder is only for completists.
B000089RVX|5.0|My first exposure to Evanescence came about a year ago when a friend of mine played \\"Fallen\\" for me.  I knew immediately I had to have it, because while the music caught my attention, I knew there must be more to it I was missing.  Boy was I right. <br /> <br />Evanescence skyrocketed up my list of favourite bands, and right now they're second only to U2 - which I can't imagine will ever be toppled from #1. ^_^  Repeated listenings of this CD only increase my respect for Amy Lee, both as a lyricist and as a vocalist.  Her voice soars and plummets, rips through your soul and entrances your ears.  Her lyrics draw you into her world, while at the same time reaching you with their reality. <br /> <br />I purchased the edition of the CD with the band version of \\"My Immortal\\" at the end, and I'm extremely glad, because it's a treat.  I could never pick a favourite song from the album because there are so many tracks.  In fact my least favourite song is \\"Everybody's Fool\\" - but every time the CD comes to that one, I end up listening all the way through because it's still a good song.  Additionally, the music video for that song has recently added new layers of meaning to that song for me. <br /> <br />\\"Tourniquet\\" is almost overtly Christian in its lyrics while still feeling true to life, showing feelings of worthlessness and uncleanness.  \\"Bring Me to Life\\" speaks to the power of a deep relationship, and the words are perfectly chosen (\\"bid my blood to run/before I come undone\\" - does it get any better?).  \\"Taking Over Me\\" is a sorrowful song with sweet lyrics and hard-driven guitar, while mourning a lost closeness.  \\"Haunted\\" is a creepy, frightening song, but it has a dark appeal to it that makes me hit the repeat button on my CD player. <br /> <br />Obviously I'm a diehard fan, and I regret that I was unable to go to the Evanescence concert this summer. This is one band that I'll be preordering every new CD.
B0001Z52RU|5.0|I've seen this movie in a sneak preview, so I had no idea of what kind of film I was gonna see and, consequently, I had no expectations about it. Though, it turned out to be a good idea to watch the movie. A very exciting storyline along with not-superstar- blockbuster actors Amy Smart and Ashton Kutcher (which in my opinion were credible and fit well with the concept of the movie), made the film into a real blockbuster (probably one of the best films I've seen so far in my long \\"career\\" as a cinemagoer) .<br /><br />It is one of the few movies that really succeed in getting the audience to put itself into the position of the protagonists. An emotionally capturing movie that by far exceeded any expectations I might have had.<br /><br />A not Hollywood-like film, not with respect to the cast, story and most importantly ending (I refer to the Director's cut version, which was a little shocking at first, but certainly a convincing and well-thought end truly deserving the appearance on the DVD edition).
6301797906|5.0|I have absolutely no problem with the idea that the greatest ending in American literature comes on the final pages of John Steinbeck's novel \\"The Grapes of Wrath.\\"  The symbolism of the final image of Rosasharn and the starving man is as potent as anything every found in an American novel, whether you are talking white whales or green-tinted glasses and silver slippers.  But there is no way on earth that a Hollywood film made in 1940 was going to film that scene and Nunnally Johnson's adaptation of Steinbeck's novel, which had only been published in 1939 when the censors were in apolexy over Clark Gable saying the word \\"damn,\\" has to come up with a suitable but obviously inadequate substitute.<br /><br />While Johnson remains remarkably faithful to the novel for most of the film, it is helpful to remember that a year earlier he had written the screenplay for \\"Jesse James,\\" and there is clearly a sense in which the Tom Joad of this film is a \\"good\\" outlaw in a similar sense.  The difference is that instead of joining the Confederacy this Tom Joad becomes a union man.  Tom (Henry Fonda) has just gotten out of prison and hitches a ride home in time to find that his family is being forced off of the Oklahoma farm that they have been sharecropping.  So the entire Joad family, Pa (Russell Simpson), Ma (Jane Darwell), Grandpa (Charley Grapewin), Rosasharn (Dorris Bowdon), and the rest pile into the family truck, joined by Casy (John Carradine in by far his finest role), a defrocked preacher who has a new, more human gospel to preach.  The truck heads for California, the family hoping that this is the Promised Land it is claimed to be in the handbills blowing across the Oklahoma landscape.<br /><br />Tom was in prison for killing a man who had stabbed him in a barroom brawl and at the end of this film he will kill again when he reaches a breaking point in the treatment that the migrant workers are enduring at the hands of the thugs wearing badges.  In the difference between those two murders is the transformation of Tom Joad from a brawler in to a fighter and more specifically a fighter with a cause.  Along the way is a journey that is as much a descent into Hell as the one Virgil took Dante on in \\"The Inferno,\\" with the horror being that this is taking place in America and (for the original film goers), in the present as well.  The Joads struggle to stay alive and stay together, and it seems that they are not going to be able to afford pride or dignity.<br /><br />The flaw in the film, if you are inclined to see it that way, is that Joad becomes a Christ-figure (with Casy forced into the John the Baptist role).  But pay attention to Tom's memorable closing speech to Ma Joan:  \\"I'll be all around in the dark - I'll be everywhere. Wherever you can look - wherever there's a fight, so hungry people can eat, I'll be there. Wherever there's a cop beatin' up a guy, I'll be there. I'll be there in the way guys yell when they're mad. I'll be there in the way kids laugh when they're hungry and they know supper's ready, and when people are eatin' the stuff they raise and livin' in the houses they built - I'll be there, too.\\"  Yes, Tom Joad is out there fighting for the little guy, but the problem is that since Tom Joad is out there, we do not have to be.  We wish him well and certainly root for him as he walks out to meet his destiny, but like Ma Joad we are going to stay behind and leave it to our hero to go fight the good fight.  The film's final line, which belongs to Ma Joad, sounds like something we would expect from a Capracorn movie.<br /><br />Director John Ford directs this black & white film with the same sense of human spectacle set against the grandeur of the American landscape that he displayed in his westerns \\"Fort Apache\\" and \\"Rio Grande.\\"  Put this is the end of that grand Old West, where cattle barons and sodbusters have given way to giant, nameless companies who gobbled up the land even when the winds have turns it into a Dust Bowl.  The black & white cinematography by Gregg Toland provides a documentary like nature, recalling Dorothea Lange's famous 1936 photograph \\"Migrant Mother.\\"<br /><br />Ford and Darwell won Oscars, but Alfred Hitchock's \\"Rebecca\\" and Jimmy Stewart in \\"The Philadelphia Story\\" won for Best Picture and Best Actor respectively.  Yet today it is clearly \\"The Grapes of Wrath\\" and Henry Fonda's performance that are a quintessential part of our American film heritage (Did you know that until 1958 it was \\"The Grapes of Wrath\\" that was considered the greatest American film and not \\"Citizen Kane\\"?).  For a decidedly different but no less effective version of the story adapted by Frank Galati for the Steppenwolf Theater of Chicago check out the 1991 stage version with Gary Sinise as Tom Joad which ends as the novel does, with the mystical smile on the face of Rose of Sharon.nto a Dust Bowl.

B0000DZEA1|5.0|This soundtrack reflects the feelings of the movie, just like the previous 2 did. In the Fellowship of the Ring, the songs help give you a percpective on the characters, like with Concerning Hobbits it is a lighthearted and joyus song, like the hobbits themselves. With Lothlorien it shows the elves as ancient,wise, yet sorrowful. The Two Towers refletcs the changes the characters have gone through. They are more mature and can feel the burden of the task at hand. This cd, I thought, was overall the most melanncholy of the 3. The Return of The King,has all the elements of the first 2 cds. In my opinion, it's the best of them also. It echoes how the characters are coming together to fight, they are stronger and ready for anything that comes their way. It also reflects some of the characters personal obstacles & their personal hurts. Many people don't like Into the West. Some feel it's too contempory or the lyrics don't go well with the rest of the cd. I  think the lyrics perfectly fit with what characters went through in the 3 movies. The Fellowship that was formed and broken have now gone in their separate directions and are drained from the burden they carried for so long, but will meet again...sooner or later. This soundtrack is a perfect ending.
B0002OERI0|5.0|Ok i'm one of the fans who green day has helped me through thick and thin. I've been listening to them since '94, been to 3 of their concerts and even played with them.  If there's one band that's influenced me more i'd be surprised.  That being said, I must say that the first time i listened to the album all the way through, I didn't like it. Not at all.  Why? After WARNING, we've come to expect songs with more acoustic guitatr, songs that don't neccessarily relate to one another...essentially, that which we would expect at this point from BJ & CO. right? Instead, Green Day has created a rock opera akin to that of TOMMY (though I must say no rock opera beats TOMMY, sorry), and it's a really good move for them.  After giving the album a second chance i've grown to love each and every song and i think that anyone who is considering getting this album should definetely give it a shot.  Don't waste your time reading these stupid reviews us random people are putting on the internet...go make up your own mind! Who are we to tell you if it's good or not, huh?
B0000DD7LC|4.0|So I use to own this album but then I gave it away, after listening to it a few times and decided that because I didn't pay for it, it was not any money lost, Well now, I heard,<br /><br />Diary, loved it, heard you don't know my name, loved it, then I heard if I anit got you, loved it, now mind you I had this CD, but was like, not! Listening to this CD on the Radio made me change my mind seeing the videos made me say: I want my CD BACK!!!!
B000002TQB|5.0|This is an awesome album and I highly recommend buying it. Parklife is a great album to buy if you've never bought a Blur album before, because it has a very wide range of music on it. Almost all of the album is great music, but a few songs are really slow and boring.
B0002OERI0|1.0|Another bland, predictable \\"effort\\" by Green Day.  How can any of you say \\"American Idiot\\" brings anything new to the table that this band hasn't been overdoing for the last 10 years.  Honesty, their first record was pretty good, why now does American Idiot sell so many records.  It shows no improvment or difference in style, and shows absolutely no originality or talent.  Your all a bunch of idiots for buying American Idiot, but I guess thats the point.
B00005JMJG|5.0|The quiet introvert Joel Barish (Jim Carrey) wakes up one day feeling under the weather, yet he leaves for work as he does everyday.  At the train station waiting for the train Joel gets the impulsive feeling to call in sick and leave for an unknown destination.  The destination is Montauk, a place that seems familiar, yet unknown to Joel who wanders the beach where he sees a girl with blue hair and visits a porch of a beach house a the middle of February.  Disoriented Joel returns to the train station where he encounters the girl with blue hair, Clementine Kruczynski (Kate Winslet), who initiates a small conversation with Joel.  The conversation leads them closer to one another as they spend the remaining day and evening together.<br /><br />Eternal Sunshine of a Spotless Mind is a cerebral journey, pun intended, as the audience will be somewhat disoriented if attention is not kept on the screen.  Clementine and Joel seem to have a history together, and the company Lacuna Inc. ([...]) seems to be the parallel that connects the two.  Lacuna is a company that focuses on destruction of the brain, i.e., erasing memories.  It happens to be that both Clementine and Joel have done business with  Lacuna.<br /><br />The story between Clementine and Joel brings the audience an intricate tale where the past feebly attempts to hide in the darkest and narrowest corner of the mind.  It is a ingenious tale created by Charlie Kaufman, who is also known for Being John Malkovich and Adaptation, where he combines cognitive psychology and love.  This combination turns out to be a well directed, sublimely edited, brilliantly performed, and an exceptional script that together brings the audience a truly unique cinematic experience that will cause both bewilderment and astonishment in the audience.

B000024D4R|5.0|This is the most depressing and misanthropic album from one of rocks great misanthropes: Roger Waters.  This album marks the time when Rog decided that Pink Floyd were going to be the purveyors of his personal muse, and what a dark and cynical muse it is.  But unlike on later albums such as the Wall and the excreble Final Cut, Pink Floyd were still a band whose members all make essential musical contributions.<br /><br />Animals is a concept album that divides humanity in an Orwellian hierarchy of Dogs: the predator bussiness driven class, Pigs: the power hungry hypocritical political class, and Sheep: all the rest of us, ie the masses.  Two short acoustic ballads frame the cynical body of Animals like bookends and are essentially the same song with different lyrics.  Suprisingly they are love songs and offer the only (slightly) uplifting bits to what is Pink Floyds darkest album.  Perhaps Waters was trying to temper the bitterness of his social commentary by saying that love is possible even in the hellish world of Animals and the only thing that makes such a world bearable.<br /><br />Dogs is the longest composition and contains some excellent acoustic playing by Dave Gilmore.  I still get chills as the song begins by slowly fading up strummed acoustic guitar and Gillmore singing Waters' deeply critical lyrics.  There is some great lead guitar on Dogs.  I have to say the Gilmore says more with one note than most guitarists say with 20.  Fantastic dark and scary synth solo by Richard Wright also.  In fact on every song, such as the excellent blues inflected electric piano opening to Sheep, the players make deep and powerful contributions.  The songs may be primarily Waters' but the album is still Pink Floyds'.  Its interesting to note that each of the long songs, Dogs, Pigs (Three Different Ones), and Sheep all have similar musical structures.  Each song has a breakdown in the middle where animal noises pertaining to each song are played and the band stretches out musically.  Sheep for example has a breakdown complete with bleating sheep and a horrific and somewhat comical take on the 23rd Psalm.  Its from the sheeps perspective as someone who is being led to the slaughterhouse.<br /><br />Lyrically Dogs is perhaps the saddest song because although the lyrics are deeply critical of the predatory Dogs, ultimately they are victims of their chosen lifestyles.  They die isolated, alone and friendless. Pigs is a biting criticism of the hyprocritical political class who claim to know whats best for the people they govern or influence.  There is no sympathy whatsoever in Waters lyrics for those small minded people who would censor or bully.  Sheep could be interpreted as hopeful or even a cautionary tale. Ultimately the sheep get tired of being abused and rise up against their opressors: \\"Bleating and babbling we fell on his neck with a scream.\\"<br /><br />Perhaps the categorization of people into Dogs, Pigs, and Sheep is too simplistic, and the overall concept too ambitious, but combined with the music, Animals works by creating a powerfully moving emotional experience.  Albeit a black one.  The entire band is working together here, yes there were inter-band tensions but they work for the music, rather than against it.  Animals is Pink Floyd at their most meloncholy, emotionally charged and ironically, rocking because of the synthesis of Waters dark vision and anger with the bands intrumental prowess.  Its a savage social commentary born of Roger Waters anger at the Tory take over of the British government.  Animals is the last great group effort from Floyd and one of their strongest statements.p for example has a breakdown complete with bleating sheep and a horrific and somewhat comical take on the 23rd Psalm.

B00005JMXX|5.0|Please cut this movie slack.  Despite the critique of scientists, this movie is non-stop shock-and-awe.  Enjoy the acting by Quaid and Gyllenhal, the dramatic escapes, and the astonishing special effects.  It's exciting and fun.  Butter the popcorn, relax and enjoy.
B0001KZM3O|1.0|Lets get something straight from the beginning:  this is NOT a Pink Floyd album. The last true Pink Floyd album was Animals because by the time of the Wall in 1979 Roger Waters had taken over the band, kicked out keyboardist Richard Wright and wrote almost all of the music.  On the Final Cut the \\"band\\" had futher devolved from being a group to being Water's solo project with guest players.  Dave Gilmour made some contributions but only sang on one song and fought with Waters constantly. Rick Wright was kicked out of the band during the Wall sessions and so doesn't appear and Nick Mason made only minor contributions to this sad dried blob of parrot droppings. Mason rightly decided that it wasn't worth it to continue in this charade of a band.<br /><br />Pink Floyds time had run out long ago but the corpse kept twitching long enough to create this their worst album. The Final Cut is an exemplar of everything bad about concept albums and Roger Waters' pretentions in particular. The music is horrible overly theatrical self-confessional and indulgent gloop that is both tremendously grating and cloying. For the most part it consists of overwrought piano ballads with sound effects that sound NOTHING like Pink Floyd.  Not surprisingly since most of the Floyd isn't on it.  In fact much of this record sounds like gloomy show tunes! The lyrics are maudlin and overly theatrical and have a similar facile theme to the Wall, ie war, what is it good for?  Absolutely nothing.  Unfortunately TFC, like the Wall before it, is ALL about the lyrics and the slight storyline. There's not an ounce of bloody good music here. Overwrought, depressing, sentimentality combined with boring music is a crime for which there is no forgiveness. Especially when it was released under the name of what was one of the best and most far sighted bands of the sixties and 70s. This is the bird poop on top of the tombstone that was the Wall and is the worst, most tedious, and pretentious Pink Floyd album. If you are a Pink Floyd fan whose first album was the Wall you may like this turd, otherwise avoid it as you would a rabid cat.a Pink Floyd fan whose first album was the Wall you may like this turd, otherwise avoid it as you would a rabid cat.
B00005NI5Y|5.0|My favorite Dylan period was from Bringing It All Back Home to Blonde on Blonde. I remember the first time I checked into the possibility of listening to Bob's newer music. I clicked on a link at Amazon, and my first impression was that his voice was unbearable. Recently, after seeing the great reviews for this cd, I decided to take a chance and order it anyway. Am I ever glad I did. I really love the music. It's got what I would call a sort of '50s rock sound....but you can never really describe Bob Dylan's music, can you? I was also suprised to find that Dylan's new lower vocal range quickly grew on me - as soon as I put aside the expectation of hearing the Bob Dylan from the '60s. Being open minded is very important when it comes to music, and I'm glad I chose to give this one a chance.
0140143505|4.0|This is a charming and memorable read. It is also a paen to the disappearing art of letterwriting. The book is a selection of correspondence between Helene Hanff in New York and Frank Doel, a bookseller in London. The correspondence spans 20 years from Helene's first request for books in 1949 to Frank's death in 1969. The correspondence rapidly changes from the formal to that between kindred souls who love books and ultimately extends to Frank's coworkers and family. Unfortunately Helene never made it to London to visit the bookstore until after Frank's death. When I first visited Charing Cross Road, which was lined with bookstores, I thought I was in booklovers'heaven.

B00003CXCT|3.0|George doesn't get it. <br /> <br />But that's nothing new, we all could see that from the new prequels. You see, something happened to George somewhere between Empire and Jedi. He lost his artistic vision, and got...well, weird.  <br /> <br />Can somebody out there, anybody, please explain to me how shooting Greedo first makes Han Solo a \\"killer\\" as George says -thus requiring a scene where Greedo shoots first? Do any of you really agree that Han was a cold-blooded monster for that? I doubt it; I don't think anybody thinks that, I think everybody thought Solo was \\"cool\\" for defending himself. Somehow, inexplicably, Goerge doesn't agree. He has confused his own morality with that of a fictional space fantasy character. In short, George has lost it. <br /> <br />Are all these added scenes and revisions really necessary? I mean, they recently released the Indiana Jones series, without new scenes, and that was just fine.  (You know, if George had the power to re-make Raiders of the Lost Ark, I bet he'd have that sword-wielding dude throw a sword at Indy before Indy shoots him, so that people don't perceive Indy as a \\"killer.\\" And you KNOW George would do it. All of us can just thank Mr. Spielberg for stopping George's silly revisionist nonsense on that series...) <br /> <br />Advice to George: Listen to the commentary on Empire, listen to director Irwin Kershner. Listen to how he talks about character development, subtlety in a scene, emotion on film...listen to how he talks about creating humor without MAKING THE MOVIE SEEM COMIC. I love this guy. He's the reason Empire was the best film overall, and I wish he had directed all the Star Wars movies. <br />
6305252521|5.0|The Truman Show is one of the most memorable Jim Carey movies I have seen as a child. Truth be told, it kind of scared me to think that everyone was watching your every move. On some level, it's been a movie that has stayed in my mind for a long time. It can compel a person to think. <br /> <br />As for the humor, the jokes seem more cynical and mocking than they do funny. Every once in a while, there will be a simple comedic joke, but on the whole, the humor in this movie seems to be used as a tool in order to convey the inhumanity of what has been done to Truman. <br /> <br />At least, that's my take on it. <br /> <br />As for the plot, here it is: Truman is a character that was obtained as a baby by a man that wanted to use him to create the perfect show that's on twenty-four/seven. He grew up with a family whose entire existence was likely fake--an assumed role--and the only girl that tried to reveal the truth to him was taken away when they were teenagers. He is now about 30, with a wife and a job and a seemingly normal, perfect life. Yet around this time, Truman begins to reject the perfect image as more and more odd things begin to happen. He digs under the surface, where the people behind his life surely don't want him looking. Dramatic things begin to happen in an effort to throw Truman off, such as the return of his assumed-dead father. But nothing can keep the truth burried now that Truman's got a piece of it.
B00000IBRI|3.0|Simply put, this film is pretty messed up.  I don't know quite how seriously we are supposed to take all this, as the various plot elements and twists are just so bizarre and/or silly.  Part of me would like to believe that this is supposed to be a whole lot more light-hearted than Argento's other fare, but I don't really believe this is the case. (I certainly could be wrong, though)  So, in the end, I suspect this was just a severe misstep on Argento's part, but it's an entertaining misstep, at least.<br /><br />This film combines Giallo with supernatural elements, to odd effect.  The basic setup is that a 14 or so year old American girl,  Jennifer Corvino, is sent off to a fancy private girls-school in Switzerland, whereabouts a maniac killer is slaughtering young girls.  Also, Jennifer sleepwalks, and has a telepathic connection with insects.(!)  Naturally, she and Scottish entomoloigist, Dr. Somethingorother, who just happens to be in the area, determine that they must catch the killer, with the help of the insects.(!)  This may sound a bit more complicated than most of Argento's other fare, and it is, which leads to the main problem with the film- too much plot, not enough killing.  The acting is something of a mixed-bag, as it tends to be in Argento's films.  Donald Pleasance, as the entomologist, gives the best performance in the film.  He's likable, and quite restrained by his standards.  Sadly, he has a smaller part than I'd imagined.  A very young Jennifer Connelly (Dark City, A Beautiful Mind) plays the lead, and suffice to say she is a much better actress now than she was then.  She's not terrible, but pretty flat and bored much of the time. (It's interesting to note that she was 14 at the time, approximately the same age as the character she was playing. What a novel concept)  Daria Nicolodi, who generally gives some of the best performances in Argento's movies, is a bit off here.  Sometimes she's good, sometimes she overdoes it.  Most of the other roles in the film are pretty tiny, but the supporting actors are quite consistently bad.  Some of Jennifer's schoolmates are almost painful to watch, but they aren't around much.  The chimp who plays the wheelchair bound entomologist helper-chimp does a decent job too, and Argento wisely does not give him too much screen time, as all monkey are hideous and obnoxious. (Though he is less hideous and obnoxious than most)<br /><br />The plot is pretty off the wall, but that's not the real problem with the film.  The real concern is that the horror scenes just aren't any where near Argento's standards.  Most of them are staged in a not particularly interesting fashion, and lack any terribly interesting gore. (There is some gross out stuff, but most of it isn't in the death scenes. I'll get to that later)  Furthermore, the killer generally uses a very modern, metallic spear, which just isn't a very interesting weapon.  Still, it has it's moments.  The most effective death is towards the beginning, where a nameless girl is being chased by the killer, and stabbed in the back with the spear.(Spoilers)  She then crashes part way through a window and screams at a Jennifer, only to have the spear driven through the back of her head and out her mouth. Sadly, that's the only killing toward the beginning of the film which is particularly interesting. (The ending is better)<br /><br />Stylistically, this is a bit more restrained than most of Argento's other films from that era.  Still, it looks nice, with lots of beautiful forested scenery, and some cool architecture and a bit of ominous, stylized lighting in some scenes.  The camerawork and cinematography aren't terribly exciting however, other than a nice shot of the camera zooming through a house to find a maggot-covered severed hand.  The music is hit and miss.  As is typical of Argento's soundtracks, and soundtracks involving Goblin, the music itself is well written, although the production techniques tend to be a bit dated.  I particularly like one of the more prominent themes, until it breaks out into an inappropriate and overdone dancebeat. (I'm talking about the one with the solo opera singer)  Still, it's not as good as what you usually get in an Argento film.  They also use some heavy metal here, and it doesn't work very well. (Unlike in Opera, where I actually think it does)  The problem is that it isn't used at appropriate times:  It's ok to use it after the killing is already underway, but not during moments where you're trying to build tension.  That, and it uses a popular, well-known song (Flash of the Blade) which is a bit distracting in and of itself. (i.e. I think it better to use more obscure stuff, so that it doesn't call too much attention to itself)<br /><br />It may seem like I've done nothing but criticize this movie, but in the end it's quite fun and entertaining.  The plot is quite absurd, but more interesting than most of his other films, and it's got a very entertaining climax, with a bunch of deliriously weird twists.  They also kick up the gross out quotient towards the end, with a nasty pit of rotting corpses, a hideous mutant child, a hilariously dated decapitation, self-mutilation in order to escape a pair of handcuffs, and worst of all, some painfully drawn out vomiting.  And the final twist, while clearly telegraphed, is pretty amusing as well.<br /><br />In the end, this is a `good-bad' movie. (unlike the 5 other Argento films I've seen, which were good-good movies)  But that's better than most movie can manages, and this is certainly worth seeing if you're interested in the director's work in general..

B000001EGA|5.0|This isn't just my favourite Elton John album, it's my favourite album, of any genre, any artist.  The completeness of the album, the looking-back on the early career of writing-partners-and-friends, the imagery and sheer musical genius of the thing make for an amazing musical experience. I can't pick out one song and tell you it's the best, although \\"Writing\\", reflects for me the awe the two felt at the time as their unique talents blended.<br /><br /> This isn't just an Elton John album, it's completely an Elton John - Bernie Taupin creation.  The lyrics, written by Bernie, are written from Elton's point of view, and are some of the most moving, poetic words ever written.  This is a team effort, reflecting love of craft and the priceless bonds of friendship.  \\"Will the things we wrote today sound as good tomorrow?\\"  In spades, gentlemen.  In spades.
B000063COX|5.0|I'd forgotten just how good this album was.  When I was first planning on writing this review I figured I was gonna give it a 4, but listening to it again it's clear that it totally deserves a 5.  Not as good as some of the later IM albums, but still classic in its own right.<br /><br />Although the IM sound hasn't completely formed on this album, pretty much all their trademarks are here, to some degree or another.(apart from Dickinson, naturally)  It's a formative Iron Maiden, for sure, but still Iron Maiden.  A little bit punkish at times, but not as much so as many would have you believe. The songs tend to be simpler than lots of their later material, but this is fine for contrast, and they still show some progressive tendencies now and then.  Paul Di'Anno isn't as good of a singer as Dickinson, but he does a fine job here.  He's a bit more rough edged of course, but still does some fairly pleasant singing on some tracks.(And his voice is probably more appropriate for the material than Dickinson's would've been)  The leadwork shines, as always, despite the absence of Adrian Smith, and there are some very nice licks too.(though not as many as they would later)  And Harris is already one of the most energetic and interesting bassists you'll ever hear in a metal band.  The drumming is pretty straight forward, but it's pretty powerful and definitely gets the job done.  It's particularly good on Transylvania.<br /><br />Many people seem to consider Sanctuary to be an IM classic, but I think's it's the weakpoint of the album.  It's not really bad, but not very good either.  Just kinda medicore.  The rest is ranges from good to classic.  The opener, Prowler, is probably the second best track here.  Solid vocals, a great, repeating guitar lick, fantastic soloing, and just a nice middle break in general.  Completely classic.  Phantom of the Opera is the absolute best song of the Di'Anno era, and one of the best Maiden songs from any era.  The whole song is excellent, but the real strongpoint is the instrumental break, which is perhaps the finest one IM has ever written.  More excellent leads, and a very fine progression from each riff and melody to the next. The instrumental Transylvania is absolutely first rate as well, and is indicative of things to come.  Boundless energy and lots of great harmonies and leads.  The third best song here.  The title track is another classic.  A bit simplistic from a songwriting standpoint, but all the pieces fit, and the harmonized lick over the running bassline sounds just fantastic.  One of the very best parts of the album.  Remember Tomorrow and Strange World are the ballad-ish songs, and both are very good.  Remember Tomorrow is perhaps the archetypal 'true metal' power ballad, while Strange World very soft and atmospheric, and quite unlike anything else I've heard from Iron Maiden.  Both are excellent in their own way.  Running Free is a bit repetitious, but still very catchy and pretty groovy.  A solid song.  I wasn't a big fan of Charlotte the Harlot at first, but it's actually quite good.  The chorus is quite catchy, and the song as a whole takes some rather unexpected turns.  Not one of the best things here, but still good.<br /><br />Definitely an Iron Maiden classic, and a metal classic in general., but the real strongpoint is the instrumental break, which is perhaps the finest one IM has ever written.

B0002OERI0|3.0|This album is solid, but it's definatly not their best. Green Day's first 4 albums were golden, but they started going down hill with Nimrod. Green Day is one of my favorite bands. I've been listening to them for about 10 years now, but the newer stuff just isn't as good as the early stuff. I think most long time fans would agree.
B00005JNEI|4.0|True to Michael Moore's movies, he tends to present a biased and opinionated view of the facts - not that this is so much a bad thing, since the complex issues surrounding 9/11 have been spoon fed to us by biased sources.  For example, I do not believe Moore's presentation of Iraq to be a happy and healthy society before the U.S. bombed it.  Nor do I believe that we intentionally targeted civilians. <br /> <br />Kudos for not resorting to shocking images of the World Trade Center, images which are already burned in our minds.  The most terrifying footage of this film is the root menu of the DVD, before the movie starts - video of a confused President. <br /> <br />If only 25 percent of this movie is accurate, it is pretty scary.  If only 50 percent of this movie is factual, it is terrifying.  And, if there is any truth at all in this film, then everyone must see it.  Maybe Michael could be a little less preachy in his next film and present an unbiased look at the issues.  Give people more credit to think for themselves.  Then, more would take his films seriously.  You owe it to yourself to watch this film and decide for yourself, no matter who you voted for in the last election.
B0000A118M|5.0|...no, seriously. This entire CD is John Coltrane's praise to God. Read the liner notes. The good part is, you don't have to be religious to appreciate this album. It's simply a jazz masterpiece.  <br /> <br />The album begins with an unexpected gong and long, drawn out phrases from Coltrane. After the \\"welcome,\\" if you will, bassist Jimmy Garrison begins the 4-note theme of the album. Acknowledgement isn't your standard jazz-swing piece, it has an almost carribean beat, but it's really fun to listen to and Coltrane's saxophone playing is very melodic and beautiful (not quite the wall-of-sound rolling solos that he would become known for). On Resolution the standard swing rhythm returns which will seem more comfortable to some jazz listeners. Once again, Coltrane is very melodic, taking a break to let pianist McCoy Tyner have a (GREAT) solo, the first of two major ones on the album. McCoy is an extremely talented improvisational pianist. The second half of the album begins with Pursuance (my personal favorite) and an amazing solo by Elvin Jones, whose rolling and tumbling and general insanity never fails to entertain. Coltrane then enters briefly playing the song's chorus then letting McCoy solo again for a good part of the song. All I can say is AMAZING. John returns again to bring in his rolling soloing, and finally Jimmy Garrison gets an extended solo for the end of the song. The closing song is probably my least favorite, Psalm, as there really is no rhythm. It is a slow, mellow song, where John plays long, passionate fills as Elvin (using mallets) and McCoy add texture. It is a mellow but nice and positive end to the album. <br /> <br />The beauty of this album is its variety. There's a variety of rhythms and styles incorporated in here and it makes listening fun every time. Although if you are new to jazz I would recommend something a bit more mainstream such as Dave Brubeck's Time Out or (the obvious) Kind of Blue, you will need this album eventually, especially if you want to get into the vast collection of Coltrane music. Consider this one of the gateways to jazz and of course Coltrane.
B00003CWL6|5.0|I will keep this short and sweet. American Beauty is the most beautiful movie I have ever had the pleasure of watching. Alan Ball's ability to capture the humor that is part of the average suburban joe is truly extraordinary. I only hope this won't be the last \\"big screen\\" screenplay we see by him.
B000005RFQ|4.0|So said Ian Gillan upon perusing this album cover, a bad cross between \\"The Exorcist\\", \\"Rosemary's Baby\\", and \\"It's Alive\\". <br /> <br />Well, Ian, I did too.  I've heard that Tony Iommi allowed it because he found it hilarious. <br /> <br />Note: I haven't heard the remastered version.  My review of this is based on my original German-made CD. <br /> <br />When Ronnie James Dio left the band, I was crushed.  However, somehow, I predicted that they would get Ian Gillan.  To my surprise, I was right!!! <br /> <br />This is not their best album.  However, it is not worth the abuse (\\"Black Purple\\") that has been heaped on it over the years (mostly by people who won't accept anything past \\"Never Say Die\\" anyway). <br /> <br />I got this album during my senior year in high school (83-84).  I had high expectations, since Sabbath are my favourite HM band and I have very high regard for Ian Gillan.  Nobody shrieks like him!  Plus, Bill Ward was back (albeit temporarily). <br /> <br />When I played it, I was struck by two things.  First of all, I was surprised at how HEAVY it is - far heavier than the two previous studio albums.  Riffmaster Tony Iommi certainly doesn't disappoint!  I also noticed that, indeed, some of the songs (especially \\"Hot Line\\") could easily have come off a Deep Purple album or one of Gillan's solo albums (he was huge as a solo artist in Europe and Japan).  Indeed, there was some controversy as he had broken Gillan up due to nodes on his vocal chords and then he shows up in Black Sabbath! <br /> <br />This is perhaps Sabbath's most controversial album after \\"Seventh Star\\" (which isn't a Sabbath album, really).  Apparently Tony Iommi and Geezer Butler didn't want to call it a Sabbath album.  Also, oddly enough, Ozzy praised the album at the time, calling it \\"the best thing I've heard from Sabbath since the original band broke up\\" (could be due to the fact that he and Gillan come from the same era of groundbreaking British metal and he and Dio hate one another's guts). <br /> <br />Gillan hated the production.  He said \\"Geezer went a bit wally and it turned into a bass solo\\".  Personally, I love the bass-heavy production - perfect for Sabbath.  Tony Iommi has also slagged the album. <br /> <br />And the songs are really good, as Gillan has said, despite the way they were put together.  He left the instrumentalists and producer Robin Black to construct the backing tracks while he camped out in a tent and wrote the lyrics while drinking Scotch and then added his vocals. <br /> <br />\\"Trashed\\" - A fast one, apparently about Gillan's misadventures with driving mini race cars while intoxicated. <br /> <br />\\"Stonehenge\\" - Weird Geoff Nicholls keyboard blurbs.  Stonehenge would, however, play a major part in this chapter of the Sabbath saga. <br /> <br />\\"Disturbing The Priest\\" - GILLAN RIPS HIMSELF OFF!  If any of you have heard the title track of the Ian Gillan Band album \\"Scarabus\\", the vocal and melody line are identical!  It's got some good shrieking, though the pseudo-evil lyrics don't really fit Gillan, who is known more as an affable jokester. <br /> <br />\\"The Dark\\" - Tony Iommi playing flute through some really weird effects. <br /> <br />\\"Zero The Hero\\" - The album's finest moment, and one of Sabbath's finest moments.  Truly heavy riff (which Guns 'n Roses would later \\"appropriate\\" for \\"Paradise City\\") and, in my opinion, Tony Iommi's finest-ever guitar solo.  However, I haven't any idea what the lyrics are supposed to be about.  Geezer's bass effects really punch here. <br /> <br />\\"Digital Bitch\\" - More solo-Gillan meets Sabbath.  Lyrically atypical for Sabbath but a good song nonetheless. <br /> <br />\\"Born Again\\" - A truly creepy song.  I have fond memories of listening to this on an early-spring night in 1984 while driving in the fog with two of my buds in my old Plymouth Volare. <br /> <br />\\"Hot Line\\" - The most Deep Purple-ish song on the album.  The solo is even Blackmore-ish. <br /> <br />\\"Keep It Warm\\" - The album's weak moment.  The song itself isn't bad, but lyrically is beyond the pale for Sabbath, unless one were to compare it to \\"She's Gone\\" or \\"Sabbra Cadabra\\". <br /> <br />The Gillan era, of course, did not last beyond this tour.  Bill Ward slipped back into alcoholism and was replaced on tour by ex-ELO drummer Bev Bevan. <br /> <br />Gillan calls himself \\"the worst singer Sabbath ever had\\".  That's a bit harsh, but I do have a bootleg live tape from this tour and he did not fit in onstage at all.  On the old stuff he mostly flubbed the lyrics (\\"Heaven and Hell\\" was almost unintelligible) and Bevan was clearly uncomfortable with music this heavy.  However, they did close the gigs with an energetic rendition of \\"Smoke On The Water\\" (which apparently incensed Ritchie Blackmore). <br /> <br />This tour will always be associated with the oversized Stonehenge stage props, which of course went on to inspire a big part of the film \\"This Is Spinal Tap\\". <br /> <br />After this album and tour, Sabbath truly went on hiatus for several years.  Geezer left, Ward was back in hospital, Gillan rejoined Deep Purple and Tony Iommi was more noted for his relationship with Lita Ford than his musical output (rumours were also rife of a reunion of the original lineup after their appearance at Live Aid in 1985). <br /> <br />The album's not perfect, but it is good.  Give it a listen with an open mind and I don't think you'll be disappointed.
B000002BQK|4.0|I love this album. Though it's different from her earlier material, this album indicated that Mariah did feel stifled when she was married to Tommy Mottola, because he didn't want her to release this record. But when \\"Honey\\" was released and went to #1, he had no choice. This has some of the best ballads Mariah has ever written. For openers: \\"Fourth of July\\" is sweet and beautiful. That's my favorite track on this album. Mariah called this the \\"sister song\\" to \\"Underneath the Stars\\". I also love \\"Butterfly\\" and \\"My All\\". The only track that doesn't do much for me is \\"The Beautiful Ones\\" which was not written by Mariah, it was written by Prince. I also noticed on this album that Mariah started changing her singing style. She went from bombastic belting (which I think works better for her) to a more breathy sound. Though she pulls off both well, she started overdoing the breathy sound after this album came out and released later material. It was as if Mariah took the success of this album and started flying on HER terms.
B00005B36H|5.0|This is a fantastic CD. Whether you're a fan of metal or not, I'd urge you to get this record. Its progressive rock at its best. The opening track, \\"The Grudge\\" is worth the $13 dollars itself, never mind the rest of this amazing record. No rock fan should be without this!    Recommended - Five stars!
0312995423|1.0|What if reality was like a Dan Brown book: <br /> <br />...\\"Hey ma, what's for dinner?\\", the boy asked innocently. A second later, his jaws fell apart. He was looking at a food item that was first served in imperial Rome only on the second full moon of every year. His mind racing, he whirled around to face his mom. It was clear from her pale visage that she too, knew what was at stake. \\"Yes, Henry, the same vegetable that only grows in certain parts of the world, that the medieval artist Duracelli immortalized in his classic painting, you must have it.\\" As Henry stood there, immobilized with shock, a part of his mind was calmly processing everything he knew about what was in front of him, how the name of the plant came from the Greek god of ants, who had, in legend, used this vegetable as his crown. \\"Maa\\", Henry finally croaked, \\"you're going to make me eat broccoli?\\"...  <br /> <br />Dan Brown creates assassins who are disgraces to their professions. The mute in digital fortress, the \\"assassin\\" in Angels and Demons, the albino in Da Vinci Code, I wouldn't pay these people two cents to engage their services, if an assassin can't bump off harmless academics, then they really aren't good for much, are they? And as for his love stories, the less said about them the better, except that, maybe, an eigh-year old, whose only experience of true romance has been to pull on his love's pigtails, could craft a better story. Mr. Brown's characters and conversations border on the ridiculous, they're so bad they almost make you cringe with embarassment. <br /> <br />So, it'd be better for everyone involved if Mr. Brown just started a series of books called \\"Sensational facts I learned about X after researching into it for the past twenty months,\\" where X can be digital history, cryptography or whatever catches his imagination next.
6301955609|4.0|Chilean director Alejandro Jodorowski has been a prominent yet somewhat elusive figure in the realm of cult films.  His 1970 film \\"El Topo\\" became the first true hit of NYC grindhouse cinema yet over his film career spanning 40-some years he has only made a handful of feature films.  Jodorowski is now back in the spotlight as the long-awaited sequel to \\"El Topo\\" is in pre-production for a tentative release in 2005.  Having never seen one of his films I decided to try Santa Sangre (1989), apparently one of his more \\"accessible\\" films.<br /><br /> It was hard for me to figure out what exactly this movie was about but I will make an attempt at a plot summary anyways.  Concha is the leader of a strange cult named Santa Sangre.  On one fateful night she catches her womanizing husband sleeping with \\"The Tattoed lady\\" and confronts them, splashing a hot drink on the genitals area of her husband.  In a fit of rage, he slices off both of her arms and then shortly after commits suicide by slashing his own throat.  The armless Concha and her son then go on a revenge and killing spree, her son standing behind her and providing arms for her to commit the kills.<br /><br />Santa Sangre is utterly bizarre.  The story unfolds in unlinear fashion and character focus keeps shifting throughout the film.  I often grow impatient with films that have such muddled and unfocussed structure (even if deliberate) but here I simply didn't care because I was so transfixed with the on-screen beauty and the art of Jodorowski's visuals.  Dialogue is rather limited and even though it gets confusing you just want to sit back and soak in the beauty of what's on screen.  Filmed in Mexico City, Jodorowski exposes us to striking architecture and a never-ending Mardi-Gras of parades, cults, circus troupes and individuals wearing lavish costumes and face paint.  The sound and music throughout the film are nothing short of stunning.  If I were to try to describe this film in one sentence I would probably say that it's surrealism without the pretentiousness usually associated with such films.<br /><br />Although they appear sporadically, there are several scenes of bodily mutilation that will make even the most seasoned horror viewer gap in awe.  It's hard to tell what Jodorowski was attempting to convey with this film.  Perhaps exposing the worst in human debauchery?  Every character in this film is deeply flawed on a human level.  No doubt about it, Santa Sangre is a must for adventurous fans of international cinema.  It's too bad the rights to his films are tied up due to disagreements with his distributor, I would love to see this stuff on DVD.probably say that it's surrealism without the pretentiousness usually associated with such films.   <br /> <br />Although they appear sporadically, there are several scenes of bodily mutilation that will make even the most seasoned horror viewer gap in awe.

0553212419|4.0|I read that somewhere and in this book I came to the part where it's close, but he did indeed not say that. *chuckles* A really good book. I read of Sherlock Holmes, saw the ill conceived cartoon about him, but up until now I've never read him. A long book yes. (1059 pages worth) And I suggest the paperback. You'll find yourself questioning alot about Holmes when you start reading, one is does this guy have any faults. Oh yes he does.
B000002KHH|5.0|This was my first heavy metal album ever, I got it when I was 5 years old on a cassette tape thanks to my dad. And all these years later, it still is THE to-own heavy metal album. Tony Iommi's guitar playing is top of the line; he reigns supreme as the guitar god throughout all eras of Black Sabbath... But with Ozzy and Geezer and Bill Ward aboard for this album, the bands 2nd release Paranoid, you definitely will want to pick this up if you don't already own it.    1. War Pigs/Luke's Wall    Ahhh yes, the classic Black Sabbath song. A very good vocal line, Iommi puts in some very cool fills.    2. Paranoid    Everybody should know this short and sweet little track, and most metal fans know the solo by heart.     3. Planet Caravan    Probably the lowest point of the album, but I still like the song. It's a softer ballad-type song, without the distortion. Very relaxing.    4. Iron Man    Ahhh yes, probably the most notable song from the whole album. From the monster sounding intro to the heavy riff, this is where it's at. The only time this song is done any better is on Black Sabbath's Last Supper Tour's live album \\"REUNION\\" (which also contains the song Black Sabbath with possibly the best solo ever done by Mr. Iommi). Also, nice tempo change.    5. Electric Funeral    Very nice use of a wah pedal and very doomish lyrics.    6. Hand of Doom    Catchy bass intro (though not near as cool as the one for N.I.B)...    7. Rat Salad    Iommi shows off his chops; and they are excellent.    8. Fairies Wear Boots/Jack The Stripper    The intro to this is a great moment, and the song has some of the best soloing on the record. You just can't fake that Iommi feel. And the best thing is, the outro to this song is so amazing. You get a package deal on this album; from beginning to end!    Definitely worth the low price you'll pay for this album. About (...) is what you'll expect to pay - and I'd say it's worth every red cent!
B00005JNEI|5.0|See this movie! It reports everything that the republican media doesn't tell you! Don't listen to republican rebuttal! They're afraid of the truth! After you see this movie, you'll think differently of this president!  <br /> <br />The movie is based on facts, not lies. Every ounce of information is well documented and outlined and includes the source of information! You can't argue with that!
B000002KKS|5.0|Yes, you can argue that Paranoid was their best album... Or even Sabotage... But truthfully, Heaven and Hell was the greatest period of Sabbath. With vocalist Ronnie James Dio on board, Iommi was seemingly able to express his guitar skills in a greater manner than ever before. Everywhere you turn on the album, you either have Ronnie filling gaps with his great vocal melody; or Iommi tearing it up with sharp trills and fills. Let me break it down for you: <br /> <br />1. Neon Knights <br /> <br />Great way to open an album. Nice chugging sends you into the song, which has a very cool solo and an outro solo. Ronnie's vocal performance coupled with Iommi's masterful guitar skills make this song something to remember. <br /> <br />2. Children of the Sea <br /> <br />My favorite Black Sabbath song. The accoustic intro sends you head first into a brick wall of awesome riffs and another to-die-for solo by Iommi. <br /> <br />3. Lady Evil <br /> <br />Probably not everybody's favorite track, but Iommi lays down another great wah-aided track where he just fills the air with energy and an upbeat rhythm that still maintains the darkness. Really good. <br /> <br />4. Heaven and Hell <br /> <br />Ahhh yes, the epic song itself. Nothing can compare to the droning guitar or this songs slow to build but epic solo; and then right after the solo the tempo changes - and Iommi turns up a great outro solo and then an accoustically aidied outro to the song itself. Utterly breathtaking. <br /> <br />5. Wishing Well <br /> <br />Very fast paced song with a very odd-timing solo. But it fits together very well. <br /> <br />6. Die Young <br /> <br />Probably should've switched this track with Lady Evil in the track listing during the first mixing, but hey... This song is completely awesome too. The interlude is the key part of this song; besides the great intro solo. This song is full of fills and awesome vocal ability. <br /> <br />7. Walk Away <br /> <br />Odd lyrics, but a good song.  <br/> <br />8. Lonely Is The Word <br /> <br />Rather heavy song with an interesting riff... The solo in this song is amazing. Iommi goes with a light octave solo and then to a hard hitting, distorted, epitome-of-metal solo. <br /> <br />Don't miss this best Sabbath album of all time. Ronnie James Dio and Tony Iommi make this album what it is, as does Geezer. It's something you can't afford to miss! \m/
B00003CXCW|4.0|Got the nostalgia bug after seeing \\"Broadway: The Golden Age\\" and everyone recommended this one. Gloria Swanson is too scary for words! But, William Holden is a hottie and the movie is seriously brilliant. it was so dark, so deeply upsetting that you can almost TASTE it as you watch it. Not the \\"That's Entertainment\\" look at Old Hollywood, but much more disturbingly great!
068987474X|3.0|Even though I agree w/ the reviews of Jack Richardson & A \\"Reader\\" I'm still giving the book average & above marks because it really addresses \\"certain\\" type of women who continually date \\"certain\\" type of men AKA \\"bad boys\\" AKA \\"players\\"   Decent men who respect women at all times do indeed exist but it would be impossible for author Greg Behrendt to believe this because players & bad boys like himself either tend to stick ONLY with their own kind or are very solitary and wouldnt consider being buddies w/ a man who does the \\"right thing\\".  By the same token not all women fall for players. People of high confidence can spot a phony a mile away & dont allow themselves to be treated shabbily by ANYONE in ANYWAY.  For the rest of you ladies,decent men exist;they are called NICE GUYS. They are problably the ones you reject regularly while you serve yourselves to those bad boy players on a silver platter.  My book suggestions along side of this one are all three of author Judy Kriansky's books, \\"Women Who Love Too Much\\",Smart Women/Foolish Choices\\" and \\"HOW TO LOVE A NICE GUY\\".
B0001LJC2K|4.0|This CD has done a lot to restore my faith in buying 'mainstream' music.<br /><br />When I say mainstream I mean that I bought it because I heard a single on the radio (\\"Time Is Running Out\\") and, after much deliberation (and downloading another song), I decided to give Muse a shot. When I first put the CD in I mostly listened to the single and the other song I had downloaded (\\"Thoughts of a Dying Atheist\\"). The rest of the CD didn't catch me--at first.<br /><br />But I soon realized that this was an excellent, excellent CD. The musicianship Muse has is gorgeous; as a string musician I was thrilled to hear the orchestral parts - which add a certain depth to the music - and there is a bit of really nice piano work that is just not normally found on average radio-band CDs. All the tracks on here are lush and dramatic; they have an expansive, massive quality to them that is difficult to describe but certainly is original. Not to say that their lyrics are lacking either: I found the song \\"Butterflies and Hurricanes\\" to be particularly inspiring, and \\"Thoughts of Dying Atheist\\" is an interesting song as well.<br /><br />None of the other songs on this CD sound much like the main single, but it's a great hook to get people to listen to some well-crafted music.
1591840562|5.0|Guy has done the favor again! By sharing his pains and gains generously with the readers he has shown path for a Happy, Successful and Rich startup/entrepreneurship. <br /> <br />It is rare for a successful person like Guy to take time to write book/s about his experience, insight and foresight with honesty. It is one think to say I was right these 10 times and other to say I was wrong these hundred times. In order to win it is not just important to do what is right but also necessary to avoid blunders and learn from some one else's mistake. The Art of the Start covers GIST of almost everything a technology startup needs to know without making the book a lengthy 'unreadable' tome. From my own experience as a small scale entrepreneur I can tell that some of the counter intuitive stuff that Guy has covered is as important as pitching, raising funds, hiring talent etc. for the long term success of the organization and the entrepreneur. If you can, please read the last chapter, Chapter 11 - The art of being Mensch first.  <br />
B00005V3Z4|4.0|Having known next to nothing about this film, but constantly hearing mountains of praise being heaped upon this obscure \\"Midnight Madness\\" fare, I had the original intention of waiting for the DVD release of the \\"Director's Cut\\" (which, as of this writing, is in limited theatrical release here in the US but, curiously, is already out on the DVD market in the UK). But after more researching & reading of reviews (including some information stating that the scenes which got left on the cutting room floor were just as much the Director's idea as that of the studio execs), and taking into consideration the fact that Director Kelly was -VERY- happy with the finished result which became this original theatrical version along with his revelation that virtually every \\"new\\" scene which will be presented in the \\"Director's Cut\\" is what's avalable on this \\"original release\\" DVD in the \\"deleted scenes\\" section, I made the conscious decision to discontinue ALL plans to wait for the \\"Director's Cut\\" -- either in DVD format or in theatrical release which, as of this writing, has still not played at any Hawaii venues.<br /><br />And so just a couple of days ago, with my recently shipped \\"original theatrical release\\" version of the DVD, I watched this movie for the very first time -- and let me say I was NOT disappointed in the very least!!! This remarkable little film lives up to all of its ubiquitous hype! (B+ easily!)<br /><br />The biggest surprise of all? -- I *TOTALLY* agreed with the trimming away of those scenes which had been selected for deletion! -- All 20+ of them! I usually go into kneejerk hysterics whenever I review deleted scenes from other films and I wind up cursing film execs for putting directors under this kind of pressure to meet some totally arbitrary \\"time constraints\\" for a film's length, but amazingly I did not have that reaction this time around! Sure, there were a couple of little \\"bit pieces\\" I would have liked to have seen within the main body of the film, but even so they were still not really necessary.<br /><br />And so \\"Donnie Darko\\" becomes only the SECOND \\"Director's Cut\\" of a film's re-release I would not endorse (the other being the D-Cut of the original \\"ALIEN,\\" which was totally unnecessary and broke the continuity it established with its sequel). Does that mean I think the new release of \\"Donnie Darko\\" is not worth seeing? I'm not saying that at all. But keep this in mind: If you have not yet seen this movie in its \\"original release\\" version, you'll be seeing in the \\"Director's Cut\\" what is, essentially, a \\"different\\" movie altogether -- because the added scenes will actually steer the story in a radically different direction leading to whole new different interpretations. It'll still be an amazing film to watch, no question about that; but it will also, in my personal opinion, actually present a WEAKER, not nearly as intense, and a less esoteric story.<br /><br />So my suggestion is to purchase the \\"original release\\" version DVD and enjoy the movie for the story it presents in its final form, then \\"IMAGINE\\" the \\"Director's Cut\\" by reviewing the \\"deleted scenes\\" and accompanying commentaries.<br /><br />Enjoy!he film, but even so they were still not really necessary.  <br /> <br />And so \\"Donnie Darko\\" becomes only the SECOND \\"Director's Cut\\" of a film's re-release I would not endorse (the other being the D-Cut of the original \\"ALIEN,\\" which was totally unnecessary and broke the continuity it established with its sequel).

B000092Q4U|5.0|Lamb of God, 'As the Palaces Burn' is exactly what you get when you mix equal parts Pantera with equal parts Slayer with just a sprinkling of old-school Metallica. Stands to reason that if you're a fan of both Pantera and Slayer, you will love Lamb of God, as I do. <br /> <br />When I first listened to Lamb of God, I listened to the whole CD in one sitting and when I was done, I was completely  drained of all mental reserves. It reminds me of the first time I listened to Slayers 'Reign in Blood' and I just sat there listening to the thunder and rain, slack-jawed and asking myself if I had sold my soul to the Metal-Gods-That-Be for the truly mind-numbing experience that is 'Reign in Blood'(turns out I did). I sat slack-jawed after listening to Lamb of God thinking the same thing, to a lesser degree and thanking the Metal-Gods-That-Be for restoring my faith in metal - it's that good!  <br /> <br />This album is truly heavy from one end to the other and there is no annoying break in its brutality - just like 'Reign in Blood'. This is something of a nice change in these days of 'nu metal' where most everything sounds like a bad Deftones copy with its progression of slow, heavy, slow, heavy-heavy. 'As the Palaces Burn' is all heavy, throughout. A very, very nice change. <br /> <br />Since that day, AtPB is all that has been in my CD player and every new CD I get, I haven't even listened to - they'll have to wait I guess.
0848808126|5.0|If you have skipped Georgette Heyer because you find her hard reading, I beg you to read \\"Convenient Marriage\\".  This is a fun book in every sense of the word; a romp in Regency era (I'm sorry, I stand corrected, it's Georgian).  There is not alot of major plot twists or deep character analysis, but plenty of just plain fun that is really very, very funny.     There is the signature Heyer's extreme meticulousness of detail, down to the exact fashion of the year, and there is also her signature dialogue, and humor.  But what I loved most of all was the love story between Hory and Lord Rule.  It is hard to do seventeen and thirty-two - there is such a disparacy of age, seventeen is really SO young - and most authors who do have this age gap in their protaganists usually simply gloss over it.  In the \\"Convenient Marriage\\", the age gap is one of the underlying problems which keep husband and wife apart - in a \\"Convenient Marriage\\", and it is with great skill, tact and humor that Ms. Heyer brings them together, at last.  Everything is done exactly right - Hory (Horatia) acts within character, Lord Rule acts within character - at least the way I think it is realistic, I have never actually seen that kind of marriage up close.      Some reviewers didn't like Horry - give it a break!  She's only seventeen!  And very spirited for seventeen, too.    But the highlight of the book for me was definitely Lord Rule.  He did and said everything just so perfectly, he treats Horry - who is leading him for a merry dance, but is also young enough to be his daughter - exactly the way a hero should!  He deals with her gently, but deal with her he does.  Although it may seem at times that Horry is coming across the winner in their battle of wits, Lord Rule is always a few steps ahead of her, but, oh, so gently, so cleverly, does he outsmart her!  I could not have imagined their interactions any better, at all.  Simply, simply perfect.      For all those who complain about all those alphamales in other novels - here is your hero!  He is about as un-alpha-male as you can get, yet he does not sacrifice his masculinity in the least!  Just for the character of Lord Rule alone it is worth rating this book ten stars!    If you are a romance reader, and have not yet read Georgette Heyer, read this book, you will NOT regret it!
B000003TAR|5.0|Every song on here is great, from the hits like \\"Heart-shaped box\\" to the lesser known masterpieces like \\"Frances Farmer will have her revenge on seattle.\\" even the lesser ones like \\"Radio Friendly unit shifter\\" are great. Sure they mispell Kurt Cobain's name, but he gets too much damn attention anyway. The queiter side of nirvana is really revealed with songs like \\"Dumb\\" and \\"Pennyroyal Tea\\" the queit ones are some of the best, which was why Unplugged in NY was so succsesful. <br />Kurt cobain seems to get better at guitar again since in nevermind he was very bad.even the album cuts (\\"I hate myself and i want to die\\") and b-sides of the singles (\\"MV\\" and \\"Marigold\\" + more) are great.
B000009F3Z|5.0|Wow! This album just crushes! All the tracks completly rule but the album is worth buying for the song \\"punish my heaven\\" alone.  Stanne's vocals almost reach the engery level of Lunar strain(and that's a good thing). The emotion in Stannes vocals are just amazing, it sounds like he really means it's and almost like he experienced it himself.  This album has very varied songs and some become very brutal at times but always accessible and melodic.  The production is also very very good as you can hear every musician play. Very tight musicianship, superb dual guitar leads and solo's, technical high precision drumming, great basslines, and some really cool female vocals(only in a few tracks not overused but just right).  As people always tend to draw comparisons to In Flames I'll give it a try as well. I think In Flames put more emphasis om creating highly catchy melodies where as with Dark Tranquillity it's a little deeper buried and weaved in the songs, also the overall song structures are a bit more technical in the DT department and have a more gloomy and dark atmosphere. I don't think one is better than the other though, it's just a matter of personal preferrence or what mood you are in.      This cd is a must for every melodic death metal fan.
B0000035E7|5.0|chad channing in my humble opinion is one of the best drummers in the world. what i noticed about this album, was that despite the fact that this is earlier than the later albums, cobain seems to be able to play guitar better. it might have something to do with the drugs or with the stomach virus. this album, despite the fact that \\"about a girl\\" is the only song contained on the \\"best of\\" has many of nirvana's best songs on it, like Floyd the barber and Swap Meet. Many people will argue with me on those choices, but we can all agree (unless we're one of those anti-nirvana pop geeks) that there is at least one good song on here. Bleach is nirvana's earliest album, and right up there with the latter nevermind and in utero.

B00005LMBK|5.0|i was raised to like heavy metal and other stuff like that, and i used to watch those video shows in the morning, seeing all these guys talk about how great they are with a beat machine behind them. Then i saw these guys, possibly one of about 3 rappers who don't go on about their \\"greatness\\". this earns them 2 of the 5 stars i gave them, 1 is earnt by the fact that despite there is only one person behind the band (i think) he gives credit to more than him. half a star is earnt by the cool cover art and production and the rest is just the fact that it's actually good music.
B0002OERI0|4.0|I'm not going to try to argue how this is a punk record, because it's not.  I know what punk is, I grew up listening to bands like Minor Threat, Black Flag, Circle Jerks, etc., and I can still appreciate a good record when I hear it.  I've always been a fan of greenday, and I think this cd is their 2nd best after Dookie.  I like how they are bringing political awareness to the mainstream,  maybe this will get the kids thinking?  It's not perfect,  but it is definately worth buying.   <br /> <br />Standout tracks: American Idiot, Jesus of Suburbia, Holiday, Boulevard of Broken Dreams, St. Jimmy, Give me Novacaine, Letterbomb, Wake me up when september ends.
B0002TKFGI|3.0|This release may well be the best CD release of Munch's recording of Saint-Saens' Organ Symphony, but for me the question is: Is it as good or better than the original RCA \\"Living Stereo\\" LP issue?  The answer here is a resounding no. <br /> <br />I have listened carefully to this disc and the \\"Shaded Dog\\" RCA original on and off now for several days.  In all respects: tonal clarity, nuance of color, 3-dimenional image, overall presence, I found the LP (a \\"1S\\" pressing) to be far superior. <br /> <br />I'm not really happy to report this.  I am hoping that the SACD  format will offer a way to reproduce the impact of Living Stereo and other great audiophile analog recordings for the mass of listeners in our digital age.   <br /> <br />The performance of course is a killer. <br /> <br />(The Escales and La Mer sound curiously flat on my SACD copy.  They must be the victim of some technical problem.) <br /> <br />Mark Hite
B00005JN7O|4.0|I enjoyed this moive so much that I had to go back and see it a second time. Overall, I thought the scenery and visual effects were the prize in this movie, but the story was interesting as well. Sure, there were a couple of indiscrepencies where the details of the plot were left out (ie what was the mini elephant for?)and the Polly character was annoying, but the progression of the movie had a good pace to keep you interested. If you remember the \\"War of the Worlds\\" and \\"Land of the Lost\\", then you should enjoy this movie since it has the look, feel and even sound of movies like the oldies. I'll definitely buy this one on DVD when it comes out.
0060925000|5.0|This lengthy and fascinating novel is set in post-Independence India.  Lata is a young university student with a passion for Jane Austen and P.G. Wodehouse.  Her mother, who has succesfully married off her two older children, is anxious to find a 'suitable boy' for Lata. <br /> <br />Unfortunately, Lata has fallen for a most unsuitable boy, a fellow student. He is handsome, charming, intelligent - and a Muslim.  Lata is courted by two other young men, a handsome dilletante who writes poetry, and an ambitious shoemaker who wants to get on in the world. <br /> <br />This novel has several different sets of characters whose stories are interwoven and overlap, but it is Lata and her delightful family who made the most vivivd impression on me.  My favourite character is Lata's mother, warmhearted, eager and ambitious for her children, she is utterly charming. <br /> <br />This story is full of fascinating characters and gripping stories which unfold against a vividly realised Indian background. I don't normally enjoy reading very, very long novels, but I couldn't put this one down.
0140067477|1.0|My religion professor assigned this book as an introduction to Daoism, but I doubt that I ever would have read it in its entirety if I was reading it outside of a class.  I couldn't stand the author's polemic against aspects of modern society such as science and other things that improve our lives.  The author even criticizes books and the people who read them... which should have been my cue to throw this book in the trash. <br /> <br />I could make any literary or pop culture icon appear to represent an ideology if I put words in its mouth, like Hoff does for Pooh.

B000071JTQ|5.0|If you read my reviews, listmanias, and \\"So-you'd-like-to\\" guides, you'll know that I REALLY REALLY like this album! Yes sir, this is my favorite album ever! The singing alone is worth the money for the album! The female singer, Cristina Scabbia, is EXTREMELY hott!! She is also the world's best singer, EVER!!!!!!!! My favorite songs are....<br /><br />ALL OF THEM!!!!!!! Every song gets at least 1 15/10! It's THAT good! BTW, i'm so f***ing sick and tired of everyone comparing them to Evangays**t, er...Evanescence. Ev sucks ass!!! Comparing Amy Lee's voice to Cristina's is like comparing the sound of construction machines to an angel's voice! Oh, and Cristina MUST be angel! She SINGS like an angel, LOOKS like angel...she HAS to be an angel!!! Her voice is tooo good to be heard by us humans. I believe she will be mine someday.<br /><br />BTW, I evan MET them! I got my copy of Comalies and a poster signed. I also got to shake each members' hand! When I shook Cristina's hand, I thought \\"I'm NEVER washing this hand again!\\" How cool is that?!?!
B000002H6C|5.0|This is my favorite metallica album. For some perspective, the last Metallica album that I listened to all the way through was the eponymous \\"black\\" or \\"smell the glove\\" album, which I had eagerly anticipated, being an angst ridden early-90's style teen metalhead at the time. The black album, try as I might to like it, sounded just like motley crue's \\"dr. feelgood\\" with james hetfield on vocals.(they shared the same producer, Bob Rock) In other words, a complete rejection of what the band had been about in their early days, id est, that whole glam greasy poofy perm metal. This is all a long way of saying that a huge aesthetic change occured after \\"Justice\\" came out. To my mind, a change for the worse, though it garnered them a huge increase in popularity (although they were already very successful without MTV or any significant radio play)I refuse to criticise this band or call them \\"sell outs\\" (a label they've been branded with since about 1983) They changed, and (the lord bless them), they are still around- the Rush of the modern era. The music they produced from Kill 'em All until this album was the soundtrack of my adolescence. It saved my life, no joke, so I won't disparage any of the music that came after, it just isn't anything I care to listen to. This album and their  earlier stuff is more compressed, you can't hear the bass distincly, the low end throbs along- to my ear, it's better this way.  Look, if you are into a more clean and technically proficient style of metal, with Hetfield's best lyrics (he morphed into Toby Keith after this one) pick this album up and rock out. Apart from the ubiquitous \\"One,\\" none of these tracks got much exposure, but \\"shortest straw\\" and \\"eye of the beholder\\"  and the oceanic instrumental  \\"To live is to die\\" are all just f'ing gorgeous pieces. Give it a listen.
068987474X|5.0|or you could read a book like this, although, I doubt it will teach you anything, in the end, as authors like Herman Hesse, Michael Szymczyk and Chuck Palahunik teach us: love always dies, and books like this, only rationalize things which don't need to be rationalized. <br />Want to understand men?  Go out with the nice guys that girls always seem to reject for the ones that aren't so nice (and for all the boys, return the stares to big ol Bertha, sittin lonely and sad by herself at the bar, and then you'll be on your way to understanding women). <br />But, I guess people will always be people, no sense in changing things that can't be changed, and so people will need to read books like this in order to understand why life, and the people in their lives, are so confusing. <br />Go ahead and click that this review wasn't helpful, I know, I know...but I figured after reading this book to post a little review with my thoughts.  It gets 5 stars because it is well-written, and worth your time if you're not ready to surrender yourself to the uncertainty of life and people, and putting your own thought into why he's not into you.
B0000844I8|1.0|A military team travels through the mysterious Stargate to \\"the other side of the known universe,\\" where they encounter a proto-Egyptian slave society ruled over by powerful aliens.  Col. Jack O'Neal (Kurt Russell), Dr. Daniel Jackson (James Spader), and company foment rebellion and combat aliens in an increasingly senseless barrage of action movie and sci-fi cliches.    I remembered seeing this movie ten years ago in the theater and not liking it then.  In the meantime, however, it had been adapted as a very entertaining TV series and my memories of that initial viewing had faded, so I decided to give this director's cut, \\"ultimate edition\\" a chance.  Shouldn't have bothered.  The writing-directing-producing team of Roland Emmerich and Dean Devlin are a couple of big-budget hacks who have only once (with \\"Day After Tomorrow\\") managed to make a film that barely rises above the level of garbage.  \\"Stargate\\" is pointless, plotless, and devoid of a sense of wonder.  The TV series, however, manages to make good use of a decent concept./
B00005JNBQ|4.0|What a colorful and cockeyed title character this film weaves in Napolean Dynamite, with his overbite large glasses, frizzy red hair, tiffs with practically everyone in his school who bugs him, and a daily dose of temper tantrums.<br /><br />It's a Wes Andersen type character study with very little really of a story until about the halfway mark. Instead, we get slice-of-life moments as we watch Napoleon deal with new friendship, girls (especially shy but provocative Deb (Tina Majorino) who has eyes for our hero), bullies, martial arts and dance. Tossed in for good measure are other hilarious characters of his family.<br /><br />Eventually our lovable geek develops into his own and shines on his own terms with a brilliant climatic show stopper. Highly recommended, especially if you've liked films like Rushmore or Tennenbaums.
0440180295|5.0|This book is a must read. It is both a criticism of society and an every-changing story that is strangely sad, yet not, strangely funny, yet not. Its statement is loud and profound with symbolism spattered throughout. It is a combination of science fiction and war.
B00005JN0T|3.0|...is that it just doesn't have enough characters. With such a cut and dry theme -- machines taking over, etc etc -- it is imperative to maintain a modicum of realism.<br /><br />While the well-made film offers a delectable blend of CGI and some mild humour along with an unexpected twist, it fails miserably by providing only one hero (and his generic love interest from the lab) who single-handedly saves the day against hordes of robots that crawl out of the woodwork to supposedly take a city under their reins.<br /><br />Wouldn't a real city call for armies or some such well trained forces into action? The end result here is thus too ludicrous to be enjoyable as Will Smith squishes all the machinery to glory all on his own.<br /><br />Watchable rental if you're really into science fiction or a major Smith buff, otherwise a fairly immemorable summer flick.
B000092Q4U|1.0|This cd has absolutely no talented vocals to it what so ever. I wanted to like this cd but there is just no way I could. It is horrible.  Sure the riffs and drums are thrashing but howling vocals over the top of it makes it sound awful!  This was a complete waste of $15 go buy Slipknot's Subliminal Verses that is the album of the year.  Or even try the second best album which is Fear Factory's archetype.  These are what talented vocalists sound like!!
B00003CXAA|5.0|There is little doubt in mind that The Godfather Trilogy is the best series ever made for film.  It is an outstanding achievement, one which I often compare other films too.  How many times have I commented, \\"Well, its no Godfather, but it is a good movie\\" are many.  There are many reasons that these film deserve the 5 star rating.  I will give you some of them now. <br /> <br />The Godfather - there was nothing quite like the first time I saw the movie.  It was for an American Lit class.  One thing I have to say was that it was a phenomenal viewing experience.  Watching Marlon Brando act in this movie was simply a joy.  There were things that this movie did that I really appreciated.  It seemed to humanize gangsters and showed during typical everyday things.  I really liked seeing them eating Chinese take-out out of the box in came in.  Little touches about how one is drawn into the family; it becomes difficult to actually ever leave.  The emphasis on \\"business\\" and you realize that these men would kill their own family if they had to.  Shocking to see! <br /> <br />The Godfather Part II - In my opinion this is the best out of the trilogy.  That is not to say that this mocie is perfect.  There are sections of the movie that I find to be slow, such as the trip to Cuba, and emphasing so much on the revolution.  It was not necessarily a bad choice to do so, but needed to be cut down some.  It was nice to see how Don Corleone came to power. Rising from just a poor immigrant, to become the powerful man that he was.  Although, this film lacks a shocking, classic, memmorable scene that was found in the original (i.e. the horse head in the bed); it still was a stellar achievement in film making. <br /> <br />The Godfather Part III - When judged on its own this movie is a good movie.  But when one tries to compare it to other two films it pales in the comparison.  However, that being said it did contain probably my favorite line in the whole trilogy: \\"just when I think thatI'm out, they pull me back in\\".  What a fitting line really.  One can never leave the mafia.  They can never leave what made them who they are.  The obvious mistake in this movie was the casting of Sofia Copolla.  She was a poor choice, and at the end, I actually cheered when she was shot.  Not a moment too soon in my opinion. <br /> <br />Over all this a great viewing experience.  Plan a weekend, and watch all three films together.  It will be a weekend well spent.
B000000993|5.0|When you look at some of the greatest bands Tool has to be mentioned.  Even though I would agree that this is not the best Tool album it was the best at the time and therfore deserves at least a 4.  Tool is all about the music behind it and the vocals on top of that are awesome.  Kennan displays what true vocal talent sounds like.  Few bands have that kind of vocalist to back them up with pure hardcore energy!!
B00005JN7O|5.0|It is a shame that more people aren't seeing this movie. It is gorgeously filmed, capraesque, thoroughly inventive, imaginative homage to early 20th century sci-fi. You will leave the theatre with a smile on your face.
B000035P7X|5.0|Two things -- There are references to Dylan being 24 at the time.  He was actually 23. <br /> <br />Also, here's another vote for the release of \\"Eat The Document,\\" centering around Bob's 1966 concert tour.
B0002OERI0|4.0|the trax on this album aren't bad songs. it's just that the album tends to go on and on. i think if they cut it in half and just had the first half of songs on this record, then it could be considered a \\"good\\" release. and for all those pepole that said that Green Day hasn't changed over the years......how long have they been around? they haven't changed their music because their fans like them just the way they are.
B0002VKZL6|5.0|I was waiting for a new album of Mark Knopfler. I loved this album very much.
B00005JLWN|4.0|Equilibrium's \\"gun kata\\" totally reminded me of \\"The Matrix.\\"  Despite the few flaws I found, because I had no expectations of it, I think I was able to appreciate it more as a result. <br /> <br />The soundtrack was well scored though.
0765301598|2.0|why did i title this book in such a way? because it is written like a mass-produced romance novel. the plot is interesting although not as intricate as the original dune books or for that matter any decent sci-fi. let me restate: this book is written poorly. when you begin a chapter and understand its gist, think of the biggest cliche that comes to mind; that, my friend, is what will happen. brian herbert managed to mess up a great premise, a fascinating universe, and it makes it so much worse because this is part of the fabulous dune series. if you want specifics, well, i will give you some examples. first and foremost, the author cannot adapt to a futuristic theme. for example, in the previous book fo the series, the hero creates a quote-unquote computer virus to defeat the all-powerful ominus computer incarnation. i mean, come on, here we have a super-advanced machine that has totally defeated mankind and cybernetic mankind, and it is wrecked by a computer virus. oy vey. second, as i mentioned before, cliche writing. example: off the top of my head, a sentence similar to this: vor atreides knew he had to do it for humanity, and he thought of his long-lose lover, who he loved, with loving love in his heart, but he was a warrior, etc. third, this book insultingly tries to explain in all facets the dune universe when the original author himself left so much to the imagination. i guess the true test of the merits of this book is that i cannot read it while i'm drunk. i lose my patience, it's that boring. read the original dune series please.
B00005JMAH|4.0|In HP and the prisoner of azkaban,i think it was pretty good,but had sevaral flaws.one of the main problems was that they did not introduce cho chang or cedric diggory,who play important parts in book 4. they also cut several scenes,including the final quitich match.but the main screw up was harry getting the firebolt at the end of the movie.if you haven't read the third book,you may say:what the h#%@?yes,this movie had some \\"what the?'s\\"in it,but it was still an over-average movie, [but i did miss ron making certian staements and faces.]mainly becuase they did great on all of the characters.
B000127LW2|5.0|I enjoyed Voyager very much and think it is better than all the other Star Trek series after TOS.
B00005JKJA|5.0|Mulholland Drive is a beautiful work of art.  This movie encompasses some of darkest emotions that we, as human beings, feel everyday, even if they are not at the same level.  We all create fantasies to, essentially, escape from reality, and mulholland drive explores this natural tendancy.  Many viewers find this movie to be over-whelming, and rightfully so.  Mulholland drive is jam-packed with symbolism, and requires alot of analysis to understand the less obvious plot twists and turns.  However, even if you don't want to use your brain to enjoy a movie, Mulholland is a must see for anyone who is touched or moved by cinema.  This movie has images that will forever be londged in a viewer's brain.  Some may say, the movie is about nothing...but how can a movie about nothing spark such strong emotions, and lock itself in your head.  I guarantee most of you will be talking and thinking about this movie weeks after you have watched it.  Now how many movies have staying power like that?  If there are more...sign me up!
B00005K3O4|3.0|Killer Klowns is sort of a homage to paranoid sci-fi movies of the 1950's (or perhaps just accidentally so as it features similarly poor production values), but lacks the shlock charm of the Blob remake which came out in the same year.<br /><br />The plot is absolute nonsense. Killer Klowns from, you guessed it, Outer Space land in rural America in their big-top spaceship. Their motive: to snatch humans away for dipping in their poisonous cotton candy. Told you it was nonsense, but the movie knows this and doesn't waste any time with sincerity (a fatal flaw with far too many cheapo horror flicks).<br /><br />The Klowns, in a very weird way, are quite cute and I wasn't afraid of them. In fact, when they are not on the screen the movie gets rather boring. The main characters are total clich&eacute;s with no charm. It might have been a better movie had they actually cast real teenagers instead of unattractive middle-aged people pretending to be teenagers. The lead character kinda looks like a retarded Daniel O'Donnell too. The Klowns however, are very funny (ironic considering I hate them in real life).<br /><br />The Chiodo Brothers give us some nice matte paintings, great make-up effects, and just enough imagination to drag through the laborious 85 minute running time. But they have no idea how to direct and edit, the music will make your ears bleed, the acting is atrocious, the sets are ridiculously phoney, and the kills are mostly lame.<br /><br />As a stupid, but slick, no-brainer Killer Klowns works fine. As the Saturday Night's main event it's best to look elsewhere.<br /><br />The Blu-ray is in decent-looking 1.85:1 1080p with DTS HD-MA 2.0 sound. The movie was clearly shot on the cheapest film stock possible (I wouldn't be surprised if it was shot on 'short ends') so it ain't never gonna look amazing, but it is a significant upgrade from the DVD and probably the best the film will ever look. There are loads of extras for fans.
B00005JNEI|5.0|Buy, rent or borrow this movie but see it. <br />Michael Moore has shown that you can love America but show that he thinks it is going in the wrong direction. <br />Touching & moving....
B00004U2GH|5.0|The ultimate C&W album. Thanks to CD's this is the complete concert because on vinyl there wasn't enough space without going to 2 LP's. It contains the classics like I Walk The Line and Ring Of Fire plus finally the unbleeped version of A Boy Named Sue. I never realized that Shel Silverstein wrote that. I know him because he wrote Cover Of The Rolling Stone and I used to read his very humorous books to my son when he was little.
B00005JNEI|5.0|Awaken America! This movie pulls everyones head from the sand and forces us to look at how we've been sold some dirty oil~ <br />Don't vote til you see this!!
B00005JNEI|5.0|The only lies in this film are coming out of the mouths of the Bush Administration. How I wish that Michael Moore had not had to make this movie...but bless him for doing so.  Watch the movie. Then vote your conscience.
B000067J1H|5.0|First off, Fight Club is, I would think, an acquired taste.  There are many of us out there who enjoy a movie for entertainment's sake, and do not wish to use our over-used minds.  However, Fight Club is amazingly entertaining, and not only that it is a picture of what society could become.  In life we become so concerned with what we own and how much we make; we forget to live our lives.  Fight Club beautifully portrays a decaying society, and in the process throughly entertains the viewer.
B000002H97|5.0|There are some who say that this Metallica album (commonly called their \\"Black Album\\") is an abandonment of their former, less mainstream, albums. I tend to see it as an improvement, showing Metallica's ability to evolve and grow.  I tend to compare this album to Nirvana's Nevermind (if you don't own that one, buy it!) in the way that they are the albums that rocketed both bands to their respective fame.  Not to mention that a good many of the REALLY popular songs that everyone has heard are on the Black Album (Enter the Sandman, Wherever I May Roam).  The guitars are simply amazing in all the songs.  It is really an amazingly constructed album, every song is great.  From the powerful \\"Don't Tread on Me\\" to the slower guitar driven ballad (and my fav. song on the album) \\"Nothing Else Matters,\\" every song delivers.  I would definitely recommend this album to anyone considering entering the world of Metallica.  It is their best.
B00005JMU2|4.0|Yes, it's true. I loved this movie. It was cute and sweet and fluffy, exactly what I wanted to see. Frankly, I think that if the studio hadn't gotten scared off they might have actually promoted it for what it was -- a fairy tale that would have worked more for the innocent Princess Diaries crowd than the jaded adults who didn't Chase Liberty.  <br /> <br />I'm very sorry this movie never found its audience. A bunch of people missed out on the chance to see a great (and verrrrrry nice on the eyes) performance by Marc Blucas, a perfect President in Michael Keaton, and the innocent anti-Cinderella portrayed by Katie Holmes. I will happily await the DVD.
B00000099Y|5.0|Aenima contains some of the best percussion ever recorded.  Danny Carey has a mastery of syncopation that only Neil Peart could top (and probably only in his heyday...).  Maynard's lyrical intonation plucks at sentimental, only to bring devastation and give summation to his ire and angst. Bass underlines the dense angry subtext of the lyrics beautifully. As for sub-par guitar playing, I refer you to the minimalism of The Edge, if you are a U2 fan.  Not every song mandates some arpeggio laden musical (...).  The studio mastering of this collection truly captures the spirit of the band.<br /><br />The interludes reorient the listener to LISTENING, not just hearing.  At first they are offputting, I agree. Allowing yourself to absorb the layered context of noise and sound can bring on a 'nirvana' of sorts.  While not a believer in the occult or a follower of strict trancendentalism, I have also experienced the alternative sensation of loss of self through concentration, especially aural.<br /><br />My only ambivalence comes in the Band's alternative beliefs.  As the title of this review alludes, it in no way detracts from the intense quality of the album. I can enjoy the music and mood without ascribing to anything they may individually espouse.
B00002MZ4W|5.0|Fiona Apple, in an unfortunate situation, was signed to Sony records during a time in which female singer/songwriters were very popular. Her new album Extraordinary Machine, is shelved because her eclectic sound doesn't sit well with record execs. Another unfortunate situation, the negative publicity surrounding the fantstic album When the Pawn. After Tidal her popularity waned, due to her appearance at the MTV music awards (and famous speech), the long-winded album title, and refusal to comply to a 'popular image'. Apple is a fantastic songwriter. This album's songwriting won't appeal to the masses because most people don't know the meaning of the word \\"derring-do\\" or \\"desideratum\\" or (from the song To Your Love). But that doesn't mean they should write her off. Her songs are completely original in their unconventional composition and do not mirror the structure of your average 3 minute radio-ready pop song. Her music is refreshing and unique and though the media may have a poor (and ill-conceived) opinion of Fiona Apple, a line should be drawn between a musician as a person and a musician as, well, a musician. (People still buy Michael Jackson records, right? And no one cares that Axl Rose is an 80's metal bratchild) <br />This album seemed to get lost among the shuffle surrounding it and maybe no one actually popped it into their stereo and gave it a good, thorough listen. If this album is any indication of what's to (hopefully) come when Extraordinary Machine is released, and Sony Music gets over themselves, I'll pre-order a copy this instant. <br />
B00005V3Z4|5.0|This movie is amazing!!!  To me, great movies mirror great books, in that, they require numerous visits, and analysis.  Sure, I am a fan of the accesible, I mean who isn't?  But movies like Donnie Darko possess images, and thoughts that stick with a viewer.  In fact, I have watched this movie about 3 times, and only now am I appreciating the mind-blowing story and symbolism this movie has.  Donnie Darko is, essentially, about a young boy's journey into adulthood, and how he percieves the fake world around him.  The movie can not be catagorized, it is everything a movie should be....and more.  The acting is superb, the storyline is enthralling, and it gives my brain some exercise, and in a world where a button does everything for us... my brain needs it!
0440237688|4.0|The Giver takes place in a perfect society. In the community the invalid are killed. All the pleasures of life are gone love, color, the arts. But the lack of joy is a trade off for no hunger, anger, sickness and poverty.  <br /> At the time Jonas turned 12 he was selected to become the receiver of memory. The moment he found out about the downs of the community he was determined to do something.    <br />  I thought the Giver was very good. However if you want the ending to make sense you must read the second and third books.  <br />
B00005JNEU|5.0|\\"Friday Night Lights\\" is powerful and excellent! This movie is based on a true story about a high school football team in Odessa, Texas in 1988 that chronicles one important season in the lives of the players, their coach, and the rest of the people in the town. Billy Bob Thornton (who recently seen as Davy Crockett in \\"The Alamo\\" (2004) and also starred as Karl Childers in his directorial debut \\"Sling Blade\\" (1996) plays Coach Gary Gaines, the high school football team's coach. Derek Luke (who played Antwone Fisher in \\"Antwone Fisher\\" (2002) plays Jimmy \\"Boobie\\" Miles, the star player and tailback for the team. Jay Hernandez (who recently starred as Keith Perez in \\"Ladder 49\\" (2004) plays Brian Chavez, the fullback for the team. Lucas Black (who also starred with Billy Bob Thornton as Frank Wheatley in Thornton's directorial debut \\"Sling Blade\\" (1996), plays Mike Winchell, the team's quarterback. Garrett Hedlund (who recently starred in \\"Troy\\" (2004) as Don Billingsley, the team's linebacker. Lee Thompson Young as Chris Comer, the team's third string tailback. And in his film debut, Tim McGraw, as Charles Billingsley, Don's father and former high-school football player. The cast is excellent. Thornton gives an excellent performance as Gaines and it is one of the best performances of his career. Luke gives an mesmerizing performance as Boobie Miles, and it also is one of the best performances of his career, thus far. Black gives an powerful performance as Winchell, and it also is of the best performances of his career, thus far. Hedlund gives an superb performance as Don Billingsley, and it also is one of the best performances of his career, thus far. Hernandez gives an pitch-perfect performance as Chavez, and it also is one of the best performances of his career, thus far. Tim McGraw, making his film debut, as Charles Billingsley, gives an mind-blowing performance, and it also is one of the best performances of any actor this year, even if he is a country singer, it proves that he is an excellent actor. All of the actors give Oscar-worthy performances, especially, Thornton, McGraw, Luke, and Black. This is an excellent sports movie, that is one of the best sport movies of its kind and it is one of the year's best. The directing by Peter Burg (who also co-wrote the screenplay) is superb and excellent. This is his best movie he's directed, thus far. He also directed last year's hit \\"The Rundown\\" (2003), which starred The Rock. The screenplay by David Aaron Cohen (who also wrote the screenplay to \\"The Devil's Own\\" (1997) & Peter Burg, based on the book by H.G. Bissinger, who is, weirdly enough, Burg's 2nd cousin, is excellent. The music by Explosions In The Sky is excellent. The cinematography by Tobias A. Schliessler (who also did the cinematography to Berg's hit \\"The Rundown\\" (2003) is excellent. The film editing by Colby Parker Jr. & David Rosenbloom (who recently film edited \\"The Last Shot\\" (2004). He also film edited \\"The Recruit\\" (2003), \\"Hart's War\\" (2002), \\"Pay It Forward\\" (2000), \\"Frequency\\" (2000), \\"The Insider\\" (1999), \\"Deep Impact\\" (1998), \\"The Peacemaker\\" (1997) & \\"Primal Fear\\" (1996) is excellent. The casting by Janet Hirshenson & Jane Jenkins is excellent. The production design by Sharon Seymour (who production designed \\"Bad Santa\\" (2003) which also starred Billy Bob Thornton, is excellent. The costume design by Susan Matheson is excellent. The art direction by Peter Borck (who recently art directed \\"Breakin' All The Rules\\" (2004). He also art directed \\"Bad Santa\\" (2003) is excellent. The set decoration by Carla Curry (who recently set decorated \\"The Alamo\\" (2004). She also art decorated the upcoming \\"Walk The Line\\" (2005) & \\"The Wendell Baker Story\\" (2004) is excellent. The football stunts coordinated by Allan Graf is excellent. This is superb, excellent, riveting, touching, powerful, and mesmerizing. Go see it for yourself, if you want to.
1594200106|3.0|Most of the reviewers on this page say that the book \\"trapped\\" them from the very first page. I don't agree, but these Spanish readers have to furl to something easy to read and with no demand in concentration or analysis. I find Ruiz Zaf&oacute;n preciousist in his idiom, pedantic in his approach to his tortuous theme, and overextended in his length (more than 538 pages).<br /><br />Editorialists compare him to Borges as Ruiz Zaf&oacute;n intends to replicate the Argentinian author's idea of the labyrintic library. If Borges were alive I'm sure he wouldn't like this comparison. Where the Argentinian saves words with exquisite care and writes no more than the necessary in order that we savor each one of his scarce pages, the Spaniard writes pages and pages of rubbish as a possessed.<br /><br />True, his evocation of the Barcelona of the pre and post Civil War is remarkable, but this doesn't make this book the motive of such good critique as it has received.<br /><br />With so many really good and interesting books one wants to read and with such a short life ahead of us, why should we read authors like this. They say Ruiz Zaf&oacute;n lives in Los Angeles, California, and is preparing his next novel. God save us from that.<br /><br />You want to read a good thriller? Read Eric Ambler, the same Borges, Perec or LeCarr&eacute;.
B0000VCZK2|3.0|After seeing all of the Alien movies, I would have to say that it is not worth getting this pack consisting of all four Alien movies and the extra discs.  The first two Alien movies were the only good ones out of the bunch.  I'd be better to simply buy those two separatly.  The following is my list of elements in each of the movies and reasons why/why not to buy each one. <br />Content goes on a NONE, MILD, MODERATE, STRONG, and CONSTANT scale.  Rating goes on a 1 to 5 scale. <br />Alien: R <br />Blood--STRONG <br />Language--MODERATE <br />Nudity--NONE <br />Scary Images--STRONG <br />Comments--Good cast, great acting and directing, and good overall original storyline. Occasional swearing (use of \\"F\\" word), plenty of blood, and the alien itself may be scary to younger viewers. <br />My Rating: 4.5 <br /> <br />Aliens: R <br />Blood--STRONG <br />Language--STRONG <br />Nudity--NONE <br />Scary Images--STRONG <br />Comments--Definatly a good choice for actors, director, etc.  The visuals are not too much different than in \\"Alien\\" but are not bad.  There is still blood and language had been jacked up several notches (use of just about everything).  Still no nudity and aliens may scare younger viewers. <br />My Rating: 5 <br /> <br />Alien 3: R <br />Blood--STRONG <br />Language--CONSTANT! <br />Nudity--NONE <br />Scary Images--STRONG <br />Comments--Forgive me those of you who enjoyed this movie, but this one sucked!  The story was fairly weak, the acting was only so-so, and at this point, Ripley has changed way too much for my liking (nothing compared to Alien: Resurrection, however).  Language is existant throughout the ENTIRE film.  Every other word is the \\"F\\" word.  Totally unnecessary.  No nudity, same for blood, and scary images.  At this point, special effects on the computer were becoming more popular.  This was a mistake.  The alien was sometimes a puppet and sometimes not.  When it was done via computer graphics, it looked terrible. <br />My Rating: 1 <br /><br />Alien: Ressurection: R <br />Blood--STRONG <br />Language--STRONG <br />Nudity--MILD <br />Scary Images--STRONG <br />Comments--WORST ALIEN MOVIE EVER...  There is no excuse as to why this should have been this bad!  The blood and images are still the same, the language has taken a step back, but still fairly strong.  Of course, in 1997 the director had to go along with the ever-increasing trend and add unnecessary nudity.  That really pissed me off.  People these days can't go with making a decent movie.  Although it's not sex, Ripley becomes a little revealing during the beginning of the film.  The alien design is the only good thing in the movie.  Much scarier for little kids, but awesome looking.  However, the movie goes back to its poor-quality state when they introduce the \\"new alien\\" at the end of the movie. It simply defies all rules and such for the alien movies.  As for the characters, Ripley is no longer the Ellen Ripley that we worried about in \\"Alien\\" or cheered on in \\"Aliens\\".  I don't even know what to say.  She just isn't herself.  As for the rest of the cast, they were horrible picks and horrible characters in the first place. <br />My Rating: 0 <br /> <br />Overall, its not worth $80.  Just go out and buy Alien and Aliens alone.  You'll be much more satisfied.
B00005JNEI|4.0|Wow! What a film! Just saw it in Tokyo where tickets cost around 20 bucks, popcorn extra. All summer long, Michael Moore has been plugged as \\"the\\" spokesman for American culture. Take that with whatever salt or soy sauce you need. As a good ex-pat (not to be confused with ex-patriot) American, it was my duty to see this film.  <br />I was expecting a comedic romp through the book \\"Dude, Where's My Country?\\" but was thankful for its seriousness and to find it touched on the way you Americans are being terrorized by your own media through orange alerts, censorship and name-calling. I admit I am sheltered here where our TV is a bit more light and fluffy. But it's amazing how we're getting all the wounded Iraqi women, children and U.S. troop footage and you're not, and your press is supposed to be \\"free,\\" at least, freer than Japan's, anyway.  <br />It's not that these violent images are good, they are horrible and regrettable. But it's necessary for people to see both sides of a thing, and such footage of a real tragedy makes people think. After 2 hrs. of such concentrated stress, I was made aware just how much better off I am here away from American television. <br /> <br />This movie only gets 4 stars: Michael could've seen that 5th star should he have treated the Washington D.C. footage a bit differently. He may think he's coming across as a righteous crusader for the truth. Instead, him being brushed off by frustrated politicians or rounded up by security seems too staged, too sensational to be taken seriously. Yeah, Michael is a rebel on the fringe. So what! That's not important to the movie. This piece of work already had enough integrity going for it. He didn't need to stage confrontations to make it more controversial or provocative.  <br /> <br />I hope many more of my fellow Americans watch this movie, if only to get a sense of the way American war-time media is being censored and manipulated.
0380820846|5.0|It had been a while since I really read any books. I mostly wrote, so reading took a back seat. Then, one day at college I felt a little board and so I leafed through a box of romance books that I my parents had given to me to take with me. Not that I remembered taking them with me and somehow there they were. But I digress. So I picked up this book, Romancing Mr. Bridgerton and read what it was about. Then I sat back in my bed and started to read it. And immediately I fell in love, one with Penelope (cause she reminded me of myself) then I fell head over heels for Colin. As the day grew to an end I realized I finished the book. It is an amazing book in that it totally flips around the normal male female characters.  <br />Although Colin appears as the heroic in the beginning, we find him to be ridden with insecurities and such. Also, in all of the books that Julia writes that have her pre-marriage, she is described as a \\"wallflower\\" to be precise. But once Julia gets into both characters we see their other sides. Penelope, we find, is extemely complex for a wallflower. What with having her own momentous secret and her vast intelligence (gasp a woman in 1800 with a brain). And then Colin, although smooth, suave, and oh so sexy on the outside, is just as complex inside with his own secret.  <br />Regardless, it truly is a magnificent book if you have a vivid imagination and enjoy movies and books about jolly ol' England. And Julia is an amazing and talented writer that she can bring to life the sights and sounds and characters in her books into your imagination.
B00005JNEI|5.0|The reviews claiming this film is fabrication are right-wing Bush supporters who are sunk in their own reality. Of course they hate it and will say whatever they can to hush it. You can not dispute the FACTS. Moore did not invent this story, with a little research you can confirm them yourself. Michael Moore's offical website (...) has an extensive fact finder (see the War Room) which is a good place to start. Read the documents yourself.    Right-wingers got so mad they've made the movie Farenhype 911 which attacks Moore for being unpatriotic. The can spin spin spin, their so good at it, but they can never address and disprove the facts!

B0000TB03W|5.0|When I first seen this concert on NBC a few years back.  I enjoyed it.  It was my first time watching Shania LIVE, on television. From there on I was hooked to her music.  I just had the oppurtunity to see Shania live @ the Staples Center in July.  Watching her live was twice as much better and believe me, Shania did, ROCK THIS COUNTRY!  If you haven't had the oppurtunity to see her live.  Then this DVD is for you.  I have it and I enjoy everytime I get the chance to see it.  Shania you ROCK!
0671027344|1.0|O.K., I bought this book because of all the stellar reviews on this website; (...) This MTV offering is Dawson's Creek in book form ... cliched and exaggerated to the Nth degree. Chbosky goes down the list of cliched characters like it's his life's mission - we have the gay boy who isn't sure he's gay, the lesbian, the jock, the confused but supposedly \\"innocent\\" boy and so on. There's nothing here an average high school student in America can *TRULY* relate to, I'm sorry. (...) There are MUCH better lesser-known books out there that run circles around this slush ...(...) Sorry, Charlie, but I can't recommend The Perks of Being a Wallflower.
B0002VKZL6|5.0|I'm a fan of just about everything Knopfler has ever done, but that doesn't mean that I think all of his solo albums have been amazing.  I still think that Goldenheart is his best work, and I was somewhat let down by both \\"Sailing to Philadelphia\\" and \\"Ragpicker's Dream\\".  That said, both of those albums have grown on me over time, and Mark's vocals and guitar work is top notch.  With \\"Shangri-La\\", I really liked the album off the bat.  The first thing that I noticed is how terrific Mark's songwriting has become (it was always very good, but he's managed to improve).  I dare anyone to find one album on the top 40 with half the intelligence and depth of even a single MK song.  Coupled with superb rhythm and his usual flawless and soulful guitar hooks, \\"Shangri-La\\" is a wonderful listen.  At the risk of sounding elitist, this isn't a work for everyone; the song themes are rather esoteric (Sonny Liston; Ray Crock) as is MK's habit, and \\"Sultans of Swing\\"-style solos are nowhere to be found.  That said, this is one of the best, most mature albums I've bought in a long while.
B000002WU9|5.0|Classic album, anyone reviewing this as bad has no idea.  Knuckleheadz is a classic song, all flow well and the beat is pretty good.  Knowledge God is a pretty decent song, not one of the best but its still great.  The beat is pretty good, but yet again they all come out good here.  Criminology has a dope as beat, and they come out hard her, i love this song.  Rainy Dayz is another classic, the beat is off the hook.  Some nice samples in the chorus too.  Next is Guillotine (Swordz) which is DEFINITELY the best song here, its one of my all-time favorite songs ever, the beat is OFF THE HOOK.  Everyone comes out hard, Ghostface's verse is my favorite verse on the whole album.  He comes so hard.  Can It Be All So Simple (remix) is a remix or the original classic.  It's not that much different in beat and music wise, which means its still classic.  Ice Cream is another classic, along with Wu-Gambinos.  All members of Wu-Tang that are featured on this album support Raekwon well here.  All tracks are great, i just pointed out some of the best.  This is definitely classic album, rap fans must have this.
B00005JNEI|5.0|Fahrenheit 9/11 is the best documentary made this year.  I know many people will tell you to see it, but a few will say dont.  What exactly is wrong with this picture?  Perhaps its because the man who made the doc. is so hated among Bush supporters.  Many of the people who support Dubya just watch this movie to slam it.  If you agree with just watching a movie to hate it, dont bother reading my review.      MIchael Moore.  What comes to your mind when you hear the name.  Someone who hates America? Someone who hates Bush? That guy that wears the strange clothing?  Well when I hear the name, I think of the good documetaries he has made.  In this particular film, Moore decides to target Bush and the Iraq war.  He interviews mothers whose children have died in the war and congressmen who refuse to send their children to the war.  Do you see what I'm getting at?  Moore tries to show both sides in this movie.  If your unsure about the reall meaning about the war, watch this documetary(or is it a comedy/drama).     Was the bit about the monkeys true? Ha ha
B0002UXBD6|5.0|Ive listened to Green Day all my life, when I was about five my mother ,God bless her, bought me my first green day cd, Dookie. Thier crude humor and \\"potty\\" words made me laugh and their fast paced instrumentals sounded really cool, from then on i was a punk rock fanatic. Later in life i got into some more early stuff...the ramones and the sex pistols,and I sort of  abandoned Green Day,for they were not the \\"cool guys\\" of punk anymore, it wasnt til September 24th that I realized the crime i had commited. Although Green Days previous album was kind of ,lets face it, corny,american Idiot broght them back with a punch. <br /> <br />From start to finish, American Idiot is a punk rock opera that is merciless. From the title track American Idiot to St. Jimmy, all the way to  Whatsername, American Idiot is a hard hitting rush of adreniline. After hearing this album I re- inducted Green Day  into my CD collection, they ARE the \\"cool guys\\" of Punk Rock and they always will be. <br />
B000002GK1|5.0|i would like to argue that badmotorfinger is a better album than superunknown. most would disagree, but this album includes lesser known tracks that are not played on the radio. I've grown tired of hearing black hole sun, etc. I acknowledge the greatness of that song and that album, but for an eleven dollar cd with unique and flowing rhymn with poetically written lyrics, you can't argue against not adding this to your collection. i highly recommend looking into it.
B00005JNEI|5.0|Moore goes for the gut (no pun intended) with a somewhat simplistic view of an extremely complex web of intrigue. It's simplistic in part because to delve into the details you might first want a degree in 20th Century geopolitics. It's simplistic also because many of the details are, frankly, unbelievable. If you watch the film, you'll learn about \\"Bandar Bush,\\" the Saudi prince who is treated like a member of the Bush family. And I don't know about you, but I never heard of ANY bin Laden before 9/11, so isn't it a strange coincidence that the Bush family had business dealings with the bin Ladens? Moore doesn't dig much deeper than that; however, if you care to do some reading elsewhere, you'll find that the details are even more incriminating. Not incriminating in the sense that George W. Bush knew in advance about 9/11, or that he caused it in some way, or even that he let Saudis leave. It's incriminating in the sense that over the course of history, actions have consequences (mostly unintended). And if you examine the interrelationships among the players in the Bush administration, you see very clearly the web of ideology, mistakes, and power that inexorably led us to where we are today. The chickens have come home to roost. Is any individual responsible or evil? No. But in a sense, our country itself is not the TARGET of \\"evildoers.\\" It is in the crossfire. There's no way to explain all this in a movie review, so here's one factoid in the form of a question: Who's the highest ranking Afghan in the U.S. government? Zalmay Khalilzad. He works for Condi Rice on the National Security Council. He was one of the officials in the U.S. State Dept. who lobbied to arm the Muhajadeen with Stinger missiles against the Soviets. He was also a Unocal advisor in the 1990s working on risk analyses for an oil pipeline that was to traverse Turkmenistan, Afghanistan, and Pakistan. The Muhajadeen was the forerunner of the Taliban, and Khalilzad supported the Taliban as a stabilizingforce. Now don't get me wrong. I am not making any insinuations about evil intent or duplicity. I'm pointing out that this \\"web of intrigue\\" is very real. You can't dismiss it simply by calling Michael Moore a liar and that's that. We are now fighting the same people that individiuals in the Bush administration armed and supported. And we deposed a dictator who was our friend when it served our short-sighted interests. And the justification that you get from our leadership is that \\"they hate our freedom\\" and \\"they hate our way of life.\\" It's not that simple. They hate specific things that have been done, and you should be shocked that these same people leading our country are so deeply entrenched in the roots of the conflict. Michael Moore's film can only touch on this, but the fact is that the reality is more shocking than he even attempts to portray.

B00003CXCT|1.0|I am tired of all things related to Star Wars.  I bought the VHS Special Edition in 1997 and the changes that Lucas made were really disappointing.  From what I read in some of these reviews, Lucas has done it again and this version has even more unnecessary revisions.  All I want is the original movie remastered and restored to its original state.
0060977493|2.0|I don't usually read books which won the Booker Prize, but this came highly recommended by a friend. Well, I did read it to the end. You do, with this one, as the characters catch hold of you and you want to know what happens to them. Still, at the close of the book, you wonder if there were any point to the story. This book reminds me of movies such as \\"House of Flying Daggers\\" by Zhang Yimou - absolutely beautiful cinematography but you find yourself wondering \\"What's the plot? WHERE'S the plot?\\"  <br />Her language is poetic, and I especially appreciate the feeling of \\"coldness\\" she described. Still, not magical enough to warrant revisiting.
B00005JNJ7|5.0|High school and college guys (and those of us with a little high school lingering inside) are clearly the target market for this movie. This crowd will enjoy Team America just because it's so over-the-top funny, irreverent, gross and crude--at first blush apparently joining the endless parade of empty teen \\"comedies\\" trying to top each other in crudeness.  <br />But folks! Wait! This is crudity with a message! <br />And boy, what a message. <br />Buried underneath the explosions and expletives is a very intelligent summation of the Way the World Is. Yes, America isn't perfect (a hilarious opening scene in Paris deftly portrays this)--but is there something else to consider besides Our imperfection? Yes Michael Moore, there is another side to this equation, and Stone and Parker--bless 'em--give it to us, and it's messy but truly original, and yes, even brilliant. The sections of the film featuring North Korea's delusional dictator are perfect. <br />  <br />I left high school--and college--a long time ago, but I can imagine what it must be like to be a kid in today's frozen politically correct climate. No matter what you say, you're gonna' break someone's rules-and what's more, the rules aren't written down anywhere. I can also imagine what a release it must be to sit in a dark theater and finally be able to safely and completely let go of every possible politically correct sacred cow, and just laugh. Nearly every one of those smug, self-righteous, self-appointed arbiters of \\"What's Right\\" get whacked good in this movie. Man, that feels good. <br /> <br />In the end, Stone and Parker give \\"the rest of us\\" a voice. After having to endure the baffling silliness of watching half of America take Michael Moore's work of 911 fiction seriously; and the ludicrous claims of \\"a chill wind\\" from the likes of Tim Robbins, it's great fun (and even a little satisfying) to watch both Moore and Robbins \\"get theirs\\" in this movie. I loved this film. I'm not sure what kind of politicsthis move represents-perhaps some new hybrid. (I thought my political leanings were undefinable until Stephen Stanton on techcentralstation.com labeled misfits like me \\"South Park Republicans.\\") If you're a common sense, hard-working American proud of Us, even with all Our faults (and you're not easily offended), you may enjoy this movie too.  <br />In fact, I loved it so much, I'm gonna' go see it again. Take that, Michael Moore. <br />
B00002MZ2C|5.0|this album is the most unique and powerful album that i ve ever heard.the album kicks off with testify,which is a mighty song .the second one ,gurellia radio, is a melodious track ,with zack spitting out his words prodigiously.sporadic track born of a brakon man ;is another track that can revitalize even the dead and listless soul.sleep now in the fire is a preeminent song which is so real and the guitar part of morello in this song is awesome with nasty effects like that of a running dj.fire spitter zack's rapping style in mariais simply perfect.ashes in the fall is another track which should be adored coz zack's ebullient vocals in this song is inevitable.mellifluous track mic check is nicely generated in timing and more than a song it sounds like a mayhem.   all in all the album is greatly packed up with power and fury which can knock down so called system ,norm and values.now rage is no more with us .tom morello and other remaing freaks really made a bad move by colliding with chris cornell to form audioslave which is not at all worth listening.
B0002OERI0|3.0|Has Green Day really sold out? This is so commercial and so far from being Punk its not even funny. This album is a rock opera, yes a rock opera! You cant get more anti-punk then writing and recording a rock opera. I mean leave that up to Queen and The Who! There are like three punk songs, the title track 'American Idiot' 'Holiday' and 'St. Jimmy' everything else is popish and commercial, everything Green Day shouldnt be. dont get me wrong some of the other songs are good but they are far from great. This is honestly the worst Green Day album they ever made! While this is a good album its far from being a great Green Day record!
B00009Z574|4.0|On the album art and title - The title the band originally intended for this album was \\"Yes Tor\\".  Hipgnosis followed that concept in creating the inner sleeve and cover art, which was taken on Yes Tor in England.  <br /> <br />The story that has surfaced in band interviews over the years is that when Hipgnosis brought the original art for the band to review, Wakeman had been talking about how he thought the whole image of the band was too stuffy and polished and \\"needed the p*** taken out of it\\". So when he saw the predictably pretentious cover art of a drummer in a suit standing on a desolate tor, he pulled a slice of tomato out of the sandwich he was eating and threw it at the picture and jokingly said, \\"Now you can call the album Tormato.\\". Hipgnosis and most of the band thought it was a brilliant idea, and a proper tomato splat was permanently added to the cover. <br /> <br />The art is the clue about the band's intentions to make accessible, non-pretentious prog, an ambitious task for a band that was one of the gold standards of pretentious prog rock in the seventies. The motivation was there but the energy wasn't, and the music industry was being overrun with quick-buck artists who didn't want to put up with a band that needed weeks to come up with a completely new musical direction.  <br /> <br />Did the band succeed? Partially yes, and that's why many Yes fans despise the album. Like Topographic Oceans, there are a lot of good ideas on the album that haven't been worked through. (But unlike Oceans, the good ideas haven't been bled to death in 20-minute extended expositions.) Like Relayer, it defies your expectations of what a Yes album, and prog music itself, should be. Like Fragile, it's a whole-band effort, and not just Anderson calling the show. <br /> <br />You can hear a war between accessibility and invention going on in nearly every track. Case in point - \\"Arriving UFO\\". Think tomato-splat prog. Think \\"Campy-Buck-Rogers-T.V.-serial-music-striding-boldly-to-the-future meets pop\\". You may not go for it, but at least it's a new and unique item on the menu. And for those who can set the \\"Yes in majestic mode a la Awaken\\" expectations aside, they might find that it can be a fun, accessible track to listen to.   <br /> <br />\\"Circus of Heaven\\" - Anderson in full twee mode with a \\"Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds\\" lyric vibe in the first section, but the slow, dreamy feel of the second section sets it off nicely. More work on the transition between the two sections, polishing the sub-standard (even for Yes) vocal arrangements, dialing down the tweeness in the rest of the arrangements and it could have been a masterpiece. But the current form shows the possibilities.  <br /> <br />\\"On the Silent Wings of Freedom\\" - Clearly the track the band focused on because the more somber sound fits the classic Yes aesthetic. The most realized track on the album, and one of Yes's best. <br /> <br />\\"Don't Kill the Whale\\" - Wakeman's Prophet-5 solo trying to sound like a whale call going into a Gary Numan/New Wave vibe. Interesting idea, fits the idea of the song, but doesn't serve the song itself. A good producer would have nixed the overly-long outro and at least tried to get Wakeman off the Polymoog and on the Hammond. The song itself is solid single material and could have had major radioplay beyond FM. <br /> <br />\\"Release Release\\" - This is the only track on the album that largely falls short of the mark. It's the least realized track on the album, with a very clumsy handling of the outro and lead-in to Howe's guitar solo. Way too frenetic and half-hearted - only Alan White's drumming is up to the job. The crowd noises during Howe's solo was a recording of a crowd at a soccer match where Wakeman's team, the Brentwood Football Club, was playing. A good producer would have slowed the song down and not allowed it on the album in this form. Yes simply wasn't a stadium rocker band, and they should have realized that at the time.   <br /> <br />Wakeman was right in saying that the band was unproducable at the time they made this album, but that doesn't address either the many strengths or the shortcomings of this album. It wasn't that they didn't have a direction, it was that they were pursuing many directions that for the most part didn't meet up at the end.  <br /> <br />What makes this album worth listening to is that there are many groundbreaking ideas in it that, if they had been properly developed, would have resulted in a masterpiece that would have made Yes a force to reckon with in both prog and mainstream pop. Unfortunately, Asia, Genesis, and the Rabin-led Yes would later succeed in this with a far less musically ambitious approach.  <br />
B00005JNEI|4.0|Documentary filmmaker Michael Moore is a master showman. His documentaries have always done well at the boxoffice, but \\"Fahrenheit 9/11\\" proved to be a runaway hit. It will probably be a long, long time before any movie of this type again takes in so much money.  <br /> <br />Its success is also a tribute to his abilities as a filmmaker. Many argue that he doesn't play fair, that he's a left-wing nutcase. Others see him as a great essayist who readily admits his works are biased by nature. To me, the fact that he can stir great debate proves that he is ingenious.  <br /> <br />What makes \\"Fahrenheit 9//11\\" so controversial is that it takes direct aim at George W. Bush and his administration. It is perhaps the most savagely satirical documentary about a sitting President ever made.  <br /> <br />The opening of the movie makes fun of Bush, who, having learned of the 9/11/2001 terrorists attacks while he visiting a Florida school, sits for a full nine minutes reading a book about a goat to a group of kids. This is an example of the `unfair' Moore. Why should the President be any less stunned by the event than the rest of us? When unreal events occur, it takes awhile for us to adjust to the `new' reality.  <br /> <br />Where the movie really takes hold is later, when Bush and company decides to invade Iraq. People all over the world, including America, asked themselves what this had to do with the war on terror. Moore's point that the invasion was based on an agenda other than fighting terrorism is fascinating. [He zeroes in on the cozy relationship between the Bush family and the rulers of Saudi Arabia, home to 15 of the 9/11 hijackers.] His focus on the REAL sacrifice of our troops is fascinating. His juxtaposition of our government's assertion that the war is surgical, precise and humane versus the real suffering on the ground in Iraq is brilliant.    <br /> <br />In an era in which all media outlets are controlled by giant corporations, Moore's voice, irritating asit can sometimes be, is refreshing. [Case in point: The movie was to be released originally by feisty Disney subsidiary, Miramax Films. The head of Disney decided that the film was too controversial, reportedly because, at the time, Disney was vying for some tax incentives in the state of Florida, whose governor is Jeb Bush, brother of George W.]   <br />
B000002L9Y|3.0|Following 1982's release of \\"Mirage\\", the core members of Fleetwood Mac would take a hiatus.  This would be a hiatus that would about five years in which during this time many of the members would explore solo efforts.    One did not know what to expect when the band would reconvene for their fifth studio album with the current lineup.   The two follow-up albums that followed the mega-album \\"Rumours\\" had failed to recapture the magic of that album.   The first follow-up, \\"Tusk\\" was an experimental effort and didn't have the commercial success.  The second album, \\"Mirage\\" still had some experimentation, but still didn't have the emotion (or commercial success) of \\"Rumours\\".  While \\"Tango in the Night\\", still doesn't measure up to the emotions that surrounded \\"Rumours\\", it does provide a fresh perspective to the core members of the band.   It would also be the last studio album for the core members of Lindsey Buckingham, Stevie Nicks, Christine McVie, John McVie, and Mick Fleetwood as Buckingham would depart the band to pursue his own solo career. <br /> <br />While \\"Mirage\\" did have its moments and continued to show an experimental side to Fleetwood Mac (i.e. Retro style songs, a Country-Western feel), one problem it had was that outside songwriters were brought in collaborate with the core members.  For Mirage. although either Lindsey Buckingham, Stevie Nicks, or Christine McVie had a songwriting credit, many of the songs were co-written with outsiders.   While the use of outsiders may have contributed to some of the innovative experimentation, it did take away from the emotion.   On \\"Tango\\", the use of collaborating with the outside songwriters is a lot less.  Only three songs are collaborations:  \\"Seven Wonders\\" (Stevie Nicks with Sandy Stewart), \\"Little Lies\\" (Christine McVie with Eddy Quintela) and \\"Family Man\\" (Lindsey Buckingham with Richard Dashut).     Another point on \\"Mirage\\" was that Buckingham, Nicks, and McVie would do no songwriting between each other.The good news is on \\"Tango in the Night\\", there are collaborations with Christine McVie and Lindsey Buckingham (\\"Mystified\\", \\"Isn't It Midnight\\", and \\"You and I Part II\\").   Perhaps less of the use of outsiders is why \\"Tango in the Night\\" is a lot less experimental, but the good news is that the effort of \\"Tango in the Night\\" more fresh and a lot less forced than \\"Mirage\\". <br /> <br />On \\"Tango\\", I do think the Lindsey Buckingham tunes that feature Lindsey on lead vocals and have him as the primary songwriter are the weakest.  It might seem like I'm picking on Lindsey on this album, but I think Lindsey's strength is in his guitar work and background vocals - not his lead vocals or songwriting.   This is an album where Stevie Nicks really shines. <br /> <br />Here is a song by song review of this album: <br /> <br />\\"Big Love\\" is the opening track and a Lindsey Buckingham track in terms of songwriting and vocals.   I'm not a big fan of this track and think its very overrated for a Fleetwood Mac tune.  However, it was the first song released from \\"Tango\\" and helped solidfy Fleetwood Mac's comeback.  I also don't like the background vocals. <br /> <br />\\"Seven Wonders\\" is probably the strongest track of the album.  This is a Stevie Nicks track as she co-wrote the song and has lead vocals.    Stevie draws a parallel between the Seven Wonders of the World and a relationship.  Perhaps the person with the \\"intensity\\" she is referring to is Lindsey Buckingham?  Usually a Stevie tune has great Lindsey Buckingham background vocals and although they are on this track - it's Christine's background vocals that shine. <br /> <br />\\"Everywhere\\" is a Christine McVie track in terms of songwriting and vocals.  Good bass work by John McVie on this song.  This is another solid song - Stevie and Lindsey do a great job on background vocals. <br /> <br />\\"Caroline\\" is a Lindsey Buckingham track in terms of songwriting and vocal.  It's a weak track, but the intro does take you back to the \\"Tusk\\" days with some good Mick Fleetwood percussion. <br /> <br />\\"Tango in the Night\\" has a slight \\"Tango\\" music feel to it.   It's another Lindsey track.  It probably is the weakest song of the collection.  Other than the \\"Tango\\" feel, it doesn't do much for me.  <br /> <br />\\"Mystified\\" is a McVie/Buckingham track.  Christine handles the lion's share of the vocals.  Still not one of my favorite tracks - but it does have some nice harmonies. <br /> <br />\\"Little Lies\\" was probably one of the biggest hits off the album.  Great melody and beat to this song.  This is a complete effort by the band - from Christine's vocals and keyboards,  to Lindsey's guitar work, Stevie's background harmonies, John McVie's bass, and Mick Fleetwood's drumming. <br /> <br />\\"Family Man\\" is another Lindsey song and it doesn't impress. <br />   <br />\\"Welcome to the Room...Sara\\" is a Stevie Nicks track.  In this song, you hear the classic Lindsey Buckingham background vocals that Stevie almost always seems to be able to blend in.  Great lyrics as well. <br /> <br />\\"Isn't' it Midnight\\" is another underrated track. It's a Christine track and has a very 80s beat to it.  The song has a lot of intensity and some very good music to it. <br /> <br />\\"When I See You Again\\" is anothe Stevie Nicks track.  It has a slower beat to it.  Stevie has some powerful vocals to support the lyrics.  Once again Stevie blends Lindsey's vocals in beautifully. <br /> <br />\\"You and I Part II\\" is another solid track - in some ways takes you back to the sound from \\"Rumours\\".  This is a track where Lindsey does a good job on lead vocals. <br /> <br />The liner notes include all of the lyrics and songwriting credits.  The production credits are also listed.   Despite some of the shortcomings, I do think this is a pretty good effort by Fleetwood Mac and might be the second strongest of the five studio albums done by the core members from 1975 through 1987.   This is an album that should keep both the Fleetwood Mac fan happy as well as the fan looking to build a Fleetwood Mac collection.
B0000DD7LB|4.0|Wow!  Britney Spears has definitly shown a great deal of effort and maturity this time around.  In her past she has released albums sich as \\"...Baby One More Time\\", \\"Oops I Did It Again\\" and \\"Britney\\".  Personaly I think those albums were nonetheless good but to much \\"bubblegum\\".  This album on the other hand is very well-balanced with slow songs like \\"Everytime\\" and \\"Shadow\\", fast, upbeat songs like \\"Brave New Girl\\" and \\"Toxic\\" and some very sexual songs like \\"Breathe On Me\\" and \\"Touch Of My Hand\\".  Over all this album deserves 4 stars.

Unmerciful, Savage, Intellectual Ridicule of these self righteous liberal lunatics....The AUDIENCE LOVED every minute of IT to.  Many WHOOPS, CLAPPING, WHISTLING AND HOLLARING..during the Actor Roasting Scenes. Its about time somebody ridiculed those Hollywood EGO's.(Its all over the Internet that Sean Penn Apparently is NOT amused LOL and wrote Stone and Parker a letter about it telling them as much..see Drudge Report for copy of letter)They weren't the only ones that got savaged by Stone and Parker in this film.  There is something for everyone. There was laughter every two minutes I swear it throughout the whole film!  The music, the vicious satire of Bruckenheimer Films, The infamous Doll Sex Scene....Nonstop laughter. It goes on and on.  A comic masterpiece. I pray it does 300 million dollars at the box office it deserves it. I'm GOING AGAIN! DOWN WITH the Film Actors Guild. Team America..(blank) YEAH! ROFL
B00005JMJG|5.0|As you may already know, Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind is about two lovers who love each other despite the fact that they are rather mismatched. Clementine (played by Kate Winslet) decides she's unhappy in the relationship after yet another fight and goes to a company named Lacuna that specializes in erasing unwanted or unhappy memories from a person's mind. She wants to rid her memory of Joel. Joel (played by Jim Carrey) decides to do the same after he accidentally finds out his former girlfriend has had \\"the procedure.\\" Unfortunately Joel decides too late--during the procedure--that he doesn't want to forget Clementine. He tries to retain some of his memories of her. Joel dreams of running away with Clementine from the memory erasing process during his sleep. The ending of the film has an unexpected happy twist: The office assistant sends all the patients' files back to them from Lacuna with the possibility that patients can then choose to regain at least some of their memories. Joel and Clementine meet in Joel's apartment and there seems to be hope that they will learn from their mistakes and try their luck at love again.<br /><br />At first the plot can be a bit confusing since the film alternates between flashbacks and the present. Nevertheless, the scenes are actually very carefully thought out and planned--even if you know the plot beforehand you can truly appreciate the movie anyway. The acting is very convincing. Many people have commented that both Kate Winslet and Jim Carrey get to expand themselves in this film: Carrey plays a very shy guy who speaks little, while Winslet plays a loud mouthed free spirit. The cinematography is excellent and many of the character's emotions are so universal we can all relate to them: There is the longing to feel wanted by Joel throughout his life; and the freedom of acting on impulses in Clementine. Great performances are also turned in by Elijah Wood and Mark Ruffalo as two inept Lacuna employees who don't do a very good job of monitoring Joel during the procedure to erase Clementine from Joel's mind. Although there are some mildly funny moments I would call this film a drama more than a comedy.<br /><br />The DVD comes with great extras including deleted scenes, a conversation between Jim Carrey and the director Michel Gondry, a brief TV commercial for Lacuna as well as a music video.<br /><br />This is a great film for adults; it's not a family film since it does have sex and drug scenes as well as language content. I believe this film is going to be one of the better films of this year and I highly recommend the DVD.

B000001DYY|5.0|\\"Elemental\\" is quite more than that, as a matter of fact. Not only does it introduce the band to a new decade, after the eighties during which they harvested one hit after another. It is the first TFF album after Curt Smith and Roland Orzabal parted ways, leaving the latter to produce arguably one of the best albums of the band... makes you wonder how much did Smith actually contribute to their sound, but that is just speculation, or maybe not?<br /><br />As for the album specifically, though \\"Break it Down Again\\" is the track that made it famous, it's far from the best song. The opening track is fabulous. \\"Mr. Pessimist\\" and \\"Gas Giants\\" both remind of Talk Talk, which is to say a lot to me, considering they are one of my favorite acts. And \\"Brian Wilson Said\\" and the closing track leave you more than wanting more: they show the great musicianship and songwriting that will continue to make Roland Orzabal legendary.<br /><br />Simply put, this is an album not to leave on the table. It belongs in the shelves of any serious music collector. Get it so you can \\"get it\\".
B000002UDB|5.0|Along with Syd barrets classic 'piper at the gates of dawn' & the beatles own 'sgt pepper' this album is a kind of pinnacle for psychadelic rock. A stone cold masterpiece. Worth it just for the all time greatest psychadelic freak out 'i am the walrus' & john/pauls beautiful odes to a childhood in liverpool 'strawberry fields/penny lane'. Plus you get the shimmering title track the gorgeous 'fool on the hill'& the flat out wierd o rama of 'flying. Strings flutes & crazy melotrons! NO one came close to mastering psychadelic rock the way the beatles did here. Buy. listen. understand brit psychadelia.
B000002L99|4.0|On here you will find one of Eddie Van Halen's Greatest Guitar Solos on Dreams.   Alex Van Halen never has drummed better, save for the For Unlawful Carnal Knowledge Tour and Michael Anthony proudly weilds his mighty bass like an elephant gun.  Sammy brought this down. <br /> <br />Good Enough(4:05) Most DLR like track on CD, great drumming. <br />Why Can't This Be Love(3:47) This is very weak and like almost every Van Halen song with the word love in the title, it is bad. <br />Get Up(4:44) DLR type song like D.O.A. on VHII, amazing drumming. <br />Dreams(4:54) Too Sammy Hagar, but great guitar solo. <br />Summer Nights(5:06) DLR type song, but kind of weak. <br />Best of Both Worlds(4:49) Amazing song, everything is top notch even though Michael Anthony's bass line never changes. <br />Love Walks In(5:11) How does a song get much worse(other than a filler song by the Beatles)This is crap) <br />5150(5:44) Top 10 greatest drum performances by Alex Van Halen.  A bit too Sammy Hagar, but with the drumming on this, it is forgiveable. <br />Inside(5:01) Good, a song about Sammy's transition in to the band, hilarious, but nothing too noteworthy. <br /> <br />Very Good.
B00005JNEU|5.0|Based on a true story, Friday Night Lights is a great sports movie about small town football.  In Odessa, Texas, the Permian Panthers, the high school football team, reign supreme over the town.  Players are treated like celebrities, and every Friday night is like the Super Bowl for the citizens of Odessa.  Because this is the only team they have, Odessa places incredible pressure on the Panthers to win the State Football Championship.  Things are no different in the 1988 season as Coach Gary Gaines hopes to lead the Panthers to victory.  When the team's star running back goes down with a serious knee injury, it looks like their season is in trouble.  This movie, directed by Peter Berg, shows very accurately just how important the football team is to Odessa.  Incredible amounts of pressure are placed on Coach Gaines and his players to win.  A season that does not end in a State Championship is a failure.  Highly recommended sports movie. <br /> <br />  Billy Bob Thornton is excellent as Coach Gary Gaines, who must lead his Panthers to the State Championships or else.  This has been quite a year for Thornton who also gave great performances in The Alamo and Bad Santa.  The movie focuses on six players on the team who all give very good, believable performances; Lucas Black as quarterback Mike Winchell, who wants to get out of Odessa but at the same time must support his mother, Garret Hedlund as fullback Don Billingsley, who must live under the watchful eye of his alcoholic father, Derek Luke as tailback James \\"Boobie\\" Miles, the cocky, extremely gifted star of the team, Jay Hernandez as free safety Brian Chavez, the gifted student, Lee Jackson as the strong, silent defensive lineman Ivory Christian, and Lee Thompson Young as Chris Comer, the small third string running back.  Tim McGraw is almost unrecognizable in his excellent performance as Charles Billingsley, Don's alcoholic father.  The movie also stars Connie Britton, Grover Coulson, and Connie Cooper.  For agreat high school football movie with an excellent cast and a great story based on the 1988 season of the Odessa-Permian Panthers, check out Friday Night Lights!
B00003CXCT|4.0|Since I know that I'm getting this set as a Christmas gift this year, I chose to rent all three movies.  I did not watch ANY of the special features yet, so this review is on the movies themselves and nothing else.  In fact, my rental versions didn't even have any bonus discs in them.  (Thanks a lot Blockbuster!)   <br /> <br />Anyway, this box set looks and sounds great.  I noticed the video remastering immediately.  I think the last time I watched this trilogy all in one weekend was when I was about 10 years old watching them on Beta tapes that I had watched so many times they were probably about ready to snap.  The picture on these (again) remastered versions is very crisp and clear.  In fact, it sometimes almost completely eliminates any \\"dated\\" looking scenes.  And on that topic, movies just aren't made like this anymore.  A lot of the battle scenes between the rebel and imperial fleets look FAR more realistic than any of the CGI stuff we're being bombarded with these days.  The reason for this is that on the Star Wars trilogy, you're seeing a real ship.  It's just that in reality, it's a very very small model.   <br /> <br />The audio was impressive too, however episode IV is a little weak in this area in some spots.  I noticed a couple of scenes with syncing issues.  In some of the scenes that are heavy in dialogue, sometimes the sound quality of the dialogue changes suddenly to the old muddy sound of the original movie.  But all in all, these discs sounded great in my home theater.  The newly mastered audio combined with the ultra clean looking video made this a whole new experience.   <br /> <br />The only reason I give this set 4 stars is because I think in the audio area, episode IV has some issues as I described above.  I also think more should have been done with some of the larger scale explosions, for example the two Death Star explosions were a little on the ho hum side in the sound department.   <br /> <br />This set is SO worth having.  These threemovies are truly more convincing than the newer episodes and I believe this is soley due to the puppetry and model techniques.  The CGI additions seem to actually make the movies look cheaper and I don't think they were necessary, though improvements were made for this set on the extra Jabba scene in episode IV that were much needed.
B000002UB3|5.0|Abbey road remains arguably the beatles pinnacle and logically therefore the best release of 1969. Led zep were repetitive. The stones entry was laden with filler with a couple of killer tracks. And floyd did nothing noteworthy after 'piper'. This album is a masterpiece of trancendant music from start to finish. <br />Highly recommended!
B000002MUQ|1.0|This is trash, whoever let them record it, obviously did not listen to it.  This is trash, never buy it, ever, unless yours or someone you care deeply about's life is on the line.
B00005JNJ7|5.0|I have seen an advance showing of this movie, and if you are easily offended, you should not go. If you love Trey Parker and Matt Stone, this will not disappoint. I have never seen such politically incorrect, tasteless, crude, rude and disgusting behavior from puppets in my entire life, and I hope to do so again, and again, and again. I cannot give away a single \\"plot\\" point, you simply must see this movie yourself. I haven't laughed this hard at anything since \\"Harold and Kumar go to White Castle\\" came out. The best part of the movie, of course, are the \\"throwaway\\" songs throughout the movie, (especially whenever Team America launch their vehicles into action) listen carefully to the lyrics, even in this day and age, completely shocking. Keep up the good work, Trey and Matt. I still love what they do. And yes, I own \\"BASEketball\\" and paid full-price for it.
B00005JNEI|5.0|Well I have been wanting to see this film since it came out, but by the time I had time to go to the movie theater it was gone. But this week I was able to buy the DVD. Yes, I know I hadn't watched the movie yet, but somehow I knew it was going to be a keeper. I have know many friends who's realitives have served in Iraq and they say its a mess and they feel like \\"why was I there?\\" You also saw that in the movie. The film is one that will be in your mind for a long time. I think people who said Michael Moore is a liar and made this all up.....most of them didn't even see the movie, like a man who was on Bill Mahr who told him that the movie was a (...)and Michael Moore asked which part, and the man who was a republican said \\"I haven't seen it yet\\". SO before making up your mind before you read, listen and watch things actually do watch and read and listen. Decide for yourself after you see the movie how you think and feel about it. Don't make up your mind based what someone else thinks.
B000005DQR|5.0|you are one of the best djs i know and that track steam by a grain of salt it touched my soul and i like to rap so as soon as i heard it i had to spit somthin and if you read this on here i was wonderin if you could make the beats and i can do the rap se im a struggling artist and all i need is a dj and a chance so whatsup
B00004Y6O9|5.0|Behind Fair Warning and 1984 this is the next best VH album. <br />Eddie Van Halen is playing guitar faster than Jimi Hendrix dreamed of.  He puts Clapton, Beck, Page, Satriani, and every other guitarist to shame with Eruption, Ice Cream Man, Ain't Talkin' 'Bout Love, and Runnin' With the Devil.  Alex Van Halen's drumming is amazing, but not even near the top. <br />Runnin' With the Devil(3:36) Great song in every way <br />Eruption(1:42) Greatest Guitarist Ever <br />You Really Got Me(2:37) the Kinks song, Eddie and the boys do it much better. <br />Ain't Talkin' 'Bout Love(3:49) Amazing, the solo is probably where the solo from Sunday Bloody Sunday by U2 is from <br />I'm the One(3:46) Weak, but not as bad as some Hagar. <br />Jamie's Cryin'(3:30) Classic Riff, great drumming also. <br />Atomic Punk(3:01) Weak, but cool beginning, kinda stupid <br />Feel Your Love Tonight(3:42) Better, but still not great <br />Little Dreamer(3:22)Good beginning riff, but like Led Zeppelin after IV, all downhill from there. <br />Ice Cream Man(3:19) Awesome, hilarious, yet brilliant, only Van Halen and only on this album. <br />On Fire(3:00) Great song, DLR is going insane enough to be required by law to be chained to a wall in alcatraz. <br /> <br />Amazing album.
B0002I831S|4.0|Great to watch the whole episodes again - the special effects are dated by today's standards, but the stories still work.  I own about 3 'series' DVD sets now, and this is my favorite in terms of the content. <br /> <br />The DVD features require you to wait until the Paramount logo and various warnings - no skipping ahead with the Menu or chapter skip buttons on your remote.  I find this irritating in the same way Spock gets irritated when Kirk points out his humanity.  There's also an encoding problem on the title page for disk 6, where one of the episide titles (shown on the main viewscreen) reverts to blocky grey text due to bad MPEG encoding, apparently. <br /> <br />The DVD also provides for selecting chapters of a series, and allows you to enable on-screen commentary or not, but there really should be audio commentary and recollections from the original cast members at this point. <br /> <br />I was young when the original series was on - I think our family watched \\"Gomer Pyle USMC\\" or \\"Hondo\\" instead - but I remember seeing one episode during the original series run. <br /> <br />I was a fan who 'found' the series in syndication, and even made audio casette tapes of the syndicated reruns of the original series 30 years ago.  You could actually follow the storyline with just an audio recording, unlike Mission: Impossible, which was WAY too visual to understand what the team was doing. <br /> <br />I've only seen the DVD extras for Season One, and they're OK, but not spectacular...  I would have like to see more of a 'making of' short along with lines of the book \\"The Making of Star Trek\\". <br /> <br />On to the packaging - love the outer case, hate the sharp plastic edges on the inner case - worried about scratching a disk. Given the content, I'll probably have to look for an archival backup mechanism for this series.
B00006HBUB|2.0|Yeah, bleah.  The best way I can put to words my feelings about this movie is to say \\"bleah.\\" <br /> <br />It's sorta not ever funny or interesting.  It's sorta not ever watchable or entertaining.  It's just bleah. <br /> <br />I'm also not sure why the female costumes were so scant and revealing, it is supposed to be a kids' film. <br /> <br />Sticking with \\"bleah\\"
B000268QB2|5.0|I really am surprised at how mature this band is for its debut.  The cd is truly amazing.  A few songs are not as strong, but overall its great.  This band definitely looks like a future Travis.  And to be honest...thank GOD its not Coldplay.  I love Coldplay, but this cd is so much less commercialized and less poppy---which makes it all that much better.

B00003CXCT|3.0|I shall confine my points in this review to the scene with the ghostly Anakin, Yoda, and Obi Wan.  The subsitution of the Anakin we are to see in Episode 3 for the original aged, ghostly Anakin, was an unmitigated disaster. <br /> <br />What is so disturbing about the replacement is not merely that youth and beauty have triumphed over age and wisdom. As for beauty, the youthful Anakin's face shows a little too much fat; on an older person it would be more excusable! As for youth, Luke Skywalker surely would look up seeing a brother, not a father, and the father-son relationship has been critical to the epic trilogy. Presumably George Lucas made the decision to help unify the prequels with the originals. He may also have been thinking of redemption, of an eternal youth, like C.S. Lewis's Narnia characters in \\"The Last Battle.\\" But he was wrong to do this, quite apart from the visual and cognitive dissonance created by the juxtaposition of the still-aged Obi Won and Yoda with the youthful Anakin. <br /> <br />The new depiction denigrates Anakin's greatest moment of spiritual clarity: that moment when he said \\"no\\" forever to the Dark Side of the Force, and \\"yes\\" to the Good Side. That moment came on the Death Star when Anakin Skywalker-Darth Vader reached deep into his own soul and found that love for his son was more important than all the emperors and systems in the universe. Indeed, it was the culmination of an internal conflict that he felt all along, and that we witnessed, for example, on the moon of Endor when the man-machine was lost in thought among the trees. Anakin's love conquered his despair, and, as he himself admitted, saved him.  <br /> <br />I reacted strongly against the change on a personal level, too. Each of us, like Anakin, has made bad decisions, made turns toward the Dark Side, if you will. If we turn to the good side, everyday, whatever grace we may exhibit as a humans will always be lived out of the sum total of our life's experiences. In our own lives, we cannot undo the past. To turn back the clock, to be a young Anakin again, at the very point where his journey goes so wrong, is both paradox and fantasy, in the negative sense of the word. Furthermore, the entire six part series is about Anakin.  It makes no sense. Unlike many mistakes, this one is completely reversable--at least for the next release of the DVD's; I certainly hope that in the inevitable boxed set for all six episodes George Lucas will give us back the \\"original\\" ghostly Anakin.  I'd certainly be prepared to fork out my hard-earned money again to have this single mistake fixed. <br /> <br />Note that my \\"Real Name\\" badge should now read: \\"Seoul, South Korea.\\"
B0002NIAZW|4.0|I went into this movie with my expectations lowered so far down that its a mystery to me how they surfaced as high as they did once the credits started rolling.<br />Ive seen ID and Godzilla and was impressed by the magnitude not the depth of either.<br />In the end both of these films donot hold much water after the 1st initial viewing.<br />Yet not the worst popcorn flicks but not even in the same realm as movies like Indiana Jones or Star Wars.<br />So enter The Day After Tomorrow a crash and bang end of the world spectacle with all the bells and whistles these movies are known for.<br />An estranged father who also happens to be a climatoligist and his son are seperated from one another during the dawn of a new ice age dad tells kid stay put stay warm im coming to get you.<br />Meanwhile survivors on the east coast invade Mexico to be close to the sun much to the chagrin of its native residents.<br />Yes the whole damn movie is contrived of silly notions of global mad science b-movie fluff but the pacing is tight unlike the directors past works which meandered  on and on Day incorporates all the same elements without ever taking you out of the movie.<br />I also like the message:<br />No matter how bad you may think you have it its not the end of the world so why wait for something really devasting to happen to make ammends in your life.<br />As simplistic as the message may be take a look around at the decline of the human spirit in our society then look at yourself a little more closely.<br />As backwards as this may seem coming from Hollywood who spend billions on movies at least someone within the machine is trying to get a valid point across.<br />Spider-Man 2 as well had a simular message of its own and even UnderWorld.<br />Is this a new era of the popcorn flick?!<br />A self aware and socially respectable Hollywood?!<br />One of the first major landmark victims in Day was a GIANT tornado erasing the HollyWood sighn.<br />Clever satire from such a dumbed down \\"evil empire\\"<br />Maybe its just a fluke!!!!<br />Either way despite what a lot of people told me to do when I saw The Day After Tomorrow dont shut your brain off while watching it there are(albeit very few)some satrical moments that are pure gold.<br />Great Movie!!!just a fluke!!!!<BR>Either way despite what a lot of people told me to do when I saw The Day After Tomorrow dont shut your brain off while watching it there are(albeit very few)some satrical moments that are pure gold.<BR>Great Movie!!!
B0001Z52RU|4.0|If you like the off-the-wall movie, check this one out.  By off-the-wall, I mean anything from FIGHT CLUB or THE BEACH to DONNIE DARKO.<br /><br />Ashton Kutcher plays a young man who, after suffering childhood blackouts, discovers a way of stepping back into his past through self-hypnosis.  When he tries to help other kids and their traumas by changing his past, he wakes up in an altered present filled with radical, sometimes-horrible differences.<br /><br />Sounds complicated, but the movie's pretty easy to follow (just pay attention).<br /><br />The DVD comes with the Theatrical Version and the Director's Cut.  The endings are different but they both worked for me.<br /><br />Cool story.
B0002IQHZM|5.0|Donovan's new \\"Beat Cafe\\" sounds deceptively simple, perhaps simplistic, on first listening.  But as the repeated listenings unfolded, I arrived at an appreciation that this is a classic set.  The sparse band dynamics with veteran Jim Keltner on drums, Danny Thompson on bass, producer John Chelew handling keyboards and Donovan on guitars give the whole set an intimate feel.  Chelew's work with Richard Thompson and John Hiatt have allowed him the confidence to give Donovan and band the space to create an unique sound.  The current #1 song in my own personal top ten is \\"Poorman's Sunshine\\" that in over 30 listenings has grown in its charm.  Thompson's bass and Keltner's brushes create a scintillating setting for Donovan's bop vocals, \\"From outa the street & onto the stage, outa my head & onto the page.\\"  This is a stellar track equal with some of Donovan's best.  On the opener \\"Love Floats\\" the combo creates a seemingly casual track with Donovan at one point shouting out, \\"Let me come in,\\" as his guitar line starts throbbing braced against Thompson's wild bass line, \\"Love floats in space, that space between us.\\"  The title track with its finger snaps is addictively hip, \\"Poet in a beret as the sax he blow & the bongo-boy go man go.\\"  \\"Yin My Yang\\" snakes sexily while \\"Two Lovers\\" with its spoken vocal is intensely romantic, \\"When two lovers kiss lips, they kiss the two of them kissing lips.\\"  \\"The Question\\" rocks like some gem from \\"Open Road.\\"  \\"Lover O Lover\\" is another breezy gem in classic Donovan mode with medieval double entendre.  The traditional \\"The Cuckoo\\" is given a great throbbing reading.  Donovan takes Dylan Thomas' classic poem \\"Do Not Go Gentle\\" and gives it a great beatnik treatment that will have you stroking your goatee.  The set concludes with \\"Shambhala,\\" a dirge with Donovan's voice trembling with emotion.  \\"Beat Cafe\\" is a master set from one of our classic master musicians.  Best of the year quality!  Bravo!
B0000009SF|5.0|I have listened to and loved Frank's music for more than 35 years. Somehow this wonderful recording \\"fell through the cracks\\" for me and I've only just now heard it. I thought it to be a piece that was a real leap in the prowess and maturity  of Frank's art and production technique. I can't believe I missed this. If you consider yourself to be a fan of Frank Zappa's you must not let this one get away. It is essential to the conceptual continuity, and really fun to listen to.
B0001CCXY8|1.0|in all honesty..ya they can play all their instruments just fine but they are the biggest joke ive ever seen in my life.Cannible corpse, gorelord, and just about all grindcorecrap bands like this are rediculous. they must be pretty badas* with their retarded song titles, lyrics and cover art huh. these guys are parthetic and i bet they are all just putting on an act becuz they r ashamed of the fact that no one in the band can stand the sight of blood and they all secretly love watching oprah and soap opras.
0783225792|5.0|Although rarely considered as good a movie, Casino is a brilliant piece of filmaking that is as good in many ways as Scorsese's earlier Mafia film Goodfellas.<br /><br />Starring Robert DeNiro as a career gambler who is very good at what he does, Joe Pesci as a his volatile \\"muscle\\" friend, and Sharon Stone as a high priced call girl and DeNiro's eventual wife, Casino is a whirlwind of stories and situations, sometimes gruesome and sometimes hilarious.  DeNiro is given a Casino to run in order to keep a steady supply of funds going \\"back home\\" to the mob bosses in Kansas City.  However, DeNiro's desire to stay straight (he's so good at what he does he feels he doesn't need Mob protection) puts him at odds with childhood friend Pesci, who is attempting to rule Las Vegas.  Then everything begins to tumble...<br /><br />An unrelenting and brutal film, hampered only slightly by the addition of James Woods as a sleazy lowlife.  However, the acting is superlative all around (Stone was nominated for an oscar) and Scorsese's always solid direction make this a movie to see.  9.5/10
B0000DJZB9|5.0|I didn't know what Guns N' Roses was until my brother bought this DVD! We were playing a board game and we wanted some music so my brother suggested we listen to Guns N' Roses, but I didn't really wanna. I tried it anyways, and guess what, I'm a big fan now! Paradise City is the best, Welcome to the Jungle rules, and Sweet Child O' Mine Rocks! Buy the DVD! Trust me, you'll be amazed!
B000002B30|4.0|Like most CD's, Bruce Springsteen's Greatest Hits is heavily stacked towards the top, resulting in a spectacular 1-8 but a large dropoff.<br /><br />Here are the tracks to the CD:<br /><br />1. Born to Run<br /><br />2. Thunder Road<br /><br />3. Badlands<br /><br />4. The River<br /><br />5. Hungry Heart<br /><br />6. Atlantic City<br /><br />7. Dancing in the Dark<br /><br />8. Born in the U.S.A.<br /><br />9. My Hometown<br /><br />10. Glory Days<br /><br />11. Brilliant Disguise<br /><br />12. Human Touch<br /><br />13. Better Days<br /><br />14. Streets of Philadelphia<br /><br />15. Secret Garden<br /><br />16. Murder Incorporated<br /><br />17. Blood Brothers<br /><br />18. This Hard Land<br /><br />I would still reccomend buying the CD, and perhaps unlike me you really like Glory Days and Better Days and think I'm a fool for prefering Dancing in the Dark and Atlantic City, but even if you don't this still harnesses almost all of the best songs The Boss and the E Street band ever played and is worth a listen.  7.5/10
1591840562|4.0|\\"The Art of the Start\\" is simply awesome!   I must say that it is the only business related book I've read that kept me in stitches throughout the read.  Guy's references to \\"clueless people\\" and those that \\"suck the most\\" were simply hilarious. <br /> <br />If you have a solid business foundation and need a boost to take action and focus on what really matters to move your business forward, then \\"The Art of the Start\\" is for you. This book is all about execution. <br /> <br />Unlike most VCs that are looking for the \\"A\\" team, combined with technology with barriers to entry that will hold off the mighty Microsoft from entering your market, and enough market traction to deem you the de facto market leader, Guy's realistic view of the world of start-ups recognizes that this is not the norm. We need to recognize the gaps in our business plans and have a realistic approach to filling those gaps.  None of us are perfect!  In fact, if we all had the team, technology and traction that most VCs dream of, we wouldn't need them.  We'd seek alternative financing and maintain complete control over our companies. <br /> <br />I've recommended \\"The Art of the Start\\" to all my friends and business associates to help them take action. After all, plenty of folks have a solid academic foundation and understand the intricacies of business, but need help executing.  <br /> <br />Guy, thanks for the boost! <br />
B00008J2DQ|4.0|I've heard all the bs people have talked on this cd, so I wanted to decipher for myself if it was good or not. I picked it up and was shocked to say the least. You hear their songs being overplayed on the radio and music channels and expect the whole cd to sound exactly like the singles they release. That may be true for some radio friendly bands, but not Godsmack.<br /><br />The reason this cd isn't five stars is because you can begin to tell that some of the intros to the songs are almost exactly like some from their previous releases, which is kind of lazy on their part, but no love lost.<br /><br />Sully has just as much anger as he did on the first two releases, but he also intertwines actual singing into his hearty yells. The lyrics are good, but I would think only writing 'I hate you' songs would get old, but hey I'm just a listener.<br /><br />The music is just as good, if not better, as it has always been. They haven't gotten worse, nor have they gotten better, just stayed about the same.<br /><br />The best songs on this cd are 'Faceless', 'Changes', 'Releasing The Demons', 'Dead And Broken', and 'I Am'. Overall this cd is well worth the money.
B00003CXCT|1.0|I have to say, I hate this version of the trilogy.  I remember seeing the original version as a kid, and I loved it.  It was such an amazing experience.  There was really nothing like it at the time, and the story pulled me in to such an extent that I saw the movie(s) multiple times and loved them each and every time.  It was not only my experience of the movie, but that of my family and my friends as well.  It was a shared social experience to see the original version of the story.  So what that the special effects weren't perfect.  My imagination filled in details that weren't specifically shown on the screen.  And, as many times as I saw that story, like many kids, I want to see THAT version of the story.  I don't want to see George Lucas's \\"Oooo, I really wish I could have done this when I made this movie.  It would have been so much cooler if....\\"  I really hate George Lucas for mucking up a social icon.  I want to see the story that I experienced and loved as a kid, not the version that George Lucas felt compelled to tweak.<br /><br />I refuse to buy this version of the movie.  If George ever decides to put out the \\"original\\" NON-special edition version of this movie, I will buy it in a heartbeat.  Until then, I'll have to live with the really old and bad VHS copy that I bought as soon as the trilogy was released onto VHS originally.
B000089RVX|4.0|I bought this cd after I heard Bring Me To Life (how cliche), and was blown away from the first chords of Going Under. I knew that with those first chords of Going Under I was in for quite a listen. It didn't surprise me that they blew up after hearing the cd, simply put it's a must buy. The reason it only got four stars though is because after the novelty wears off it gets kind of old. Amy Lee's vocals are flawless, you can feel her pain in her lyrics. She's an amazing songstress to say the least. She deserves the fame she has, she really does earn it with this release. The music is great too, I really can't complain. When the music needs to be heavy, it's heavy. When it needs to be soft, it's soft. They compliment Amy's vocals perfectly.<br /><br />The stand out tracks on this disc are Going Under, Haunted, Imaginary, Taking Over Me, and My Last Whisper. Like I said though, this cd does get old over time, but I enjoy going back and hearing some extremely good music from time to time. It's by far worth every last penny.
B0000041WV|5.0|Istvan Kertsz' pioneering anthology of Dvorak's music from the 1960's has stood the test of time. This box of the 9 symphonies remains a clear first choice, even more when offered at bargain price. As with the set of symphonic poems and concert ouvertures, as well as the Requiem, Kertsz proves totally at home in the composer's sound-world and secures atmospheric playing from a London Symphony Orchestra on top form. Excellent sound quality throughout, often belying its age. Warmly recommended.
B00005MM67|4.0|First, I won't spend too much time reviewing this film, there are enough reviews on here, or elsewhere, that tell the story. This is a good movie, and while not great, arguably the best, or most accurate dramatic film on mountaineering (Touching the Void being a documentary). It's a good story, well acted, and there is some spectacular cinematography along with a great score.     As to the DVD, while I am very glad it exists in the first place, I was a bit disappointed.  The sound is good, though only stereo. The picture quality is good, but it's in 4:3 pan and scan, (not the original letterboxed widescreen it was shot in). And there are no real extras. That's too bad as there could have been a lot here. Perhaps missed most of all is an isloation of Chaz Jankel's excellent score, which was never made available on CD, and remains locked in a vault somewhere.     All in all, a good movie, but an average DVD.
0803726570|5.0|My 1 1/2 year old loves this book, as do I. The illustrations are wonderful and it has a great rhythm for reading aloud. The story is wonderful and I plan to order more books by this author/illustrator duo. I highly recommend!
B00003CXCT|1.0|I can't believe that after all of the wait, the version released have been changed AGAIN!  Why can't Lucas just let the movies speak for themselves and give the fans what we want - the ORIGINAL's!????!?!?!
B00005JMUA|4.0|Now really, Quentin, we all wanted to know at the end of Volume I what the flap was all about -- but you really mean to tell us all this blood and gore all over the floor was because the ole green-eyed monster reared its ugly head?  Bill got jealous when his Bride dumped him for another guy?  How mundane can you get?  Well, I guess it's as good a reason as any, but why did Bill have to take out the whole wedding party?  Talk about overkill...<br /><br />Okay, I have a problem with the underlying motives, but \\"Kill Bill 2\\" is as stylish as its predecessor, without all the carnage.  The cast is superb.  David Carradine makes a predictably revolting Bill, but the movie is stolen by Liu Cha Hui as the Bride's sadistic tutor Pai Mei; the sequence which shows the Bride's training under this spellbinding maniac is easily the best thing in the film.<br /><br />The other sequences showing the Bride getting revenge on Bill's assassination team are pretty good on their own; there is something deliciously satisfying about the Bride popping out Daryl Hannah's one good eye instead of killing her outright, leaving her blind for the rest of her life and probably wishing she had been killed instead.  But the final sequence, showing the Bride reunited with her offspring, somehow doesn't jibe with the rest of the movie; it's hard to reconcile the image the Bride as a doting mommy beside that of an obsessed killing machine.  But \\"Kill Bill\\" was never about substance; it's all about style, and on that basis it can stand on its own any day.  Like its predecessor, it doesn't measure up to \\"Pulp Fiction\\", Tarantino's masterpiece, but it's great fun in its own right.
B00001OH7U|5.0|The title track was the first song of the second set of many a show.  The white noise of Slick's guitar/train effect with the rhythm repeating over and over and over was hypnotic and gave you an idea of David's mind at the time.  I've read  that David drove the band very hard during this time, demanding take after take after take..he had a sound that he was shooting for and he hit it out of the park.  \\"Word on a Wing\\" is a modern hymn, all white light and beautiful..it breaks your heart.  There's spirit meeting the flesh here...some kind of existential crisis.
B000002UZ1|5.0|This is a seminal Beatles compilation and here's why:<br /><br />a) The cover photograph - This album shows how far the Beatles had come. Yes, they looked like hippies, but they also were at their peak musically and showed that they weren't afraid to change.<br /><br />b) Revolution - if you want the catchy fast upbeat version of Revolution, you gotta get it here.<br /><br />c) John Lennon: Lennon's tracks (though they're written as Lennon-McCartney) show a unique genius in full motion<br /><br />d) George Harrison: great tracks on CD 2<br /><br />Nearly 40 years on, this album is still in reissue and no wonder.  If 1962-1966 was the pop appetizer, 1967 - 1970 is the Beatles in full force. This amazing body of work was created in just 3 years! This is probably the best Beatles sampler.<br /><br />This collection is worth getting if you don't want to plod through the Beatles White Album and Let it Be (but it's not meant to replace Sgt Pepper's or Abbey Road).
0778320448|5.0|Lydia, a survivor of cancer, opens a knitting shop called A Good Yarn located on Blossom Street - a street seeing much change. Her father died recently and this is her way of trying to get on with her life in different ways.<br /><br />Her first class is scheduled and the project is a simple baby blanket. Three ladies sign up for the class: Jaqueline, Carol and Alix. Each woman learns to knit as well as share their lives with each other.<br /><br />This is a beautiful story. It is the first book by Debbie Macomber that I've read. The plot centering around a knitting shop sparked my interest because I am a knitter and cross stitcher. This story could easily be in a stitching shop as needlearts bring women together for support of all kinds.
0452282152|1.0|I'm an avid reader and can usually read a good novel in 2-3 evenings.  This, however, took over a week to plod through. I'm in a book club and this novel was chosen as our October novel. I came close to abandoning it about every 10 pages.  If it weren't for my club, I would have.  The novel lacks depth and is shallow in theme.  I was  extremely disappointed in the writing style, as I have heard from others that Chevalier is an exceptional writer.  Unfortunately, this novel does not reflect her talents.
0393035158|4.0|I believe it should not come to anybody's surprise that religious-inspired violence poses an increasingly alarming threat to the well-being, or even survival of humanity.  <br />Sam Harris is one of the few people who have the courage to step out and address the root of the problem (often ironically mistaken for the balm)- faith itself. <br />\\"The End of Faith\\" may be at times reductionist, but the core message remains coherent and dead on.
B00005K3LW|5.0|John McClane returns to kick serious butt, if he can get rid of his headache. Bruce Willis reprises his star role of John McClane in this third installment of the Die Hard series. Doing battle this time around with Simon Gruber, Hans Gruber's brother. Simon sets out to destory John McClane for throwing his little brother out of The Naktomi building in the first Die Hard. Setting up elebrate bombs all over New York, he almost succeeds in destroying the city. With the mix of humor and heavy action, John T. does a excellent job returning to the director's chair.
B000063COX|5.0|While Bruce Dickinson is THE voice of Iron Maiden, I think Paul DiAnno's contribution during the early Maiden years is too often overlooked. \\"Phantom of the Opera\\" and \\"Sanctuary\\" are the first great tunes that turned me on to Iron Maiden, and alerted me to just what an incredible group they are. <br /> <br />I won't go as far to say that I like DiAnnio over Dickinson... there is nobody in all of heavy metal that could reproduce that melodic war-cry of a voice he lets rip! But DiAnnio was unique, and left enough of an impression on this album that I think he deserves a bit more of a nod than he gets. <br /> <br />If you have only heard the highlight CDs of Iron Maiden like \\"Number of the Beast\\" and \\"Powerslave,\\" believe me, you are missing out. Those albums are excellent, true. This album is one of the finest beginnings of any band in the this genre of music.  <br /> <br />\\"Phantom of the Opera\\" is such a unique piece in the heavy metal tunes of that era. There are so many terrible metal lyrics from that era, which makes this great song stand out. The combo of common mental torment, silent film references, and the classic Maiden guitar licks make everyday domestic-despair sound like gothic horror. <br /> <br />One of those rare albums that is every bit as good as Iron Maiden's later efforts! Worth the time and dough!
B0002B15WE|5.0|This movie set the standard for action flicks. With a mix of action and comedy, Bruce Willis broke the box office with this story of high rise adventure. While out in L.A. visiting his wife, New York cop John McClane finds himself in the middle of a terriorist takeover. Armed with only his Berreta and wise-cracks (and the enemies' cigarettes), he sets out to free his wife and the other hostages from the terrorists. This is a great action movie for the guys.
B00007AJF8|5.0|I just had a few miscellaneous comments on this very unusual film. I'm usually easily entertained when it comes to movies, because I don't usually expect very much of them (at least the stuff that normally comes out of Hollywood as compared to various independent directors). It's rare that I really rave about a film, but I have to admit I was impressed with how original and unusual this film was. A lot of films are pretty predictable, but this one isn't, and the film had me wondering what kind of wacky and funny hijinx or scene would come up next. But they did just that for the next two hours. The film also playfully explores some pretty profound questions relating to identity, consciousness, the afterlife, and so on. And on top of that there's a kinky scene or two that are pretty over the top just by themselves.<br /><br />Given all the above, I would have to count this as one of the more intelligent, unusual, and funny movies to come out in recent memory. I was a little surprised it had even been produced and come out of Hollywood rather than by an independent director, but shortly after I'd seen the film I heard a brief interview on PBS with the scriptwriter and he said the same thing, that he was surprised when the script was picked up and the studio actually decided to make the film.<br /><br />Also, it's great to see Orson Bean is still working, and actually, I thought he looked pretty good for his age in the movie. I remember from the old days when he appeared on the Johnny Carson show and he called himself a \\"humorist\\" rather than a comedian. Well, I'm not sure really what the difference is between humor and comedy, but this movie certainly has them both in spades and it was very obvious he had a lot of fun making the movie too.<br /><br />I very rarely rent movies that I've seen in the theater and see them twice, but I plan on renting this one and watching it again soon, since I haven't seen it since it first came out five years ago. Overall, a very unusual, outrageous, and entertaining film that I suspect will become a cult classic.taining film that I suspect will become a cult classic.
B000002J29|5.0|I nearly wore the grooves off my vinyl copy of \\"Seconds Out\\" when I was a kid.<br /><br />This was my first Genesis album, and in some ways is still my favorite. Sure, it was recorded after Peter Gabriel left the group, but Phil Collins does a fine of handling the vocals.<br /><br />The energy is palpable as the crowd's enthusiasm drives the band to an impassioned performance of many of Genesis's masterpieces. Highly recommended.
B000059TEP|4.0|Hadn't seen this film for well over a decade until this afternoon. The story is quite engaging and Whoopi Goldberg really steals the show in (arguably) her last great role. Patrick Swayze is believable however Demi Moore is just awful. Can the girl do anything in this movie except cry? And that song, Unchained Melody...arghh! It makes me ears bleed!
B0000AQVCL|5.0|Jet is one of those weird, brilliant bands that doesn't sound from this era at all. Take a look at the \\"Get Born\\" cover, and then listen to the material contained within and you get the impression this was some over-looked gem from the 70's. There is never a moment that doesn't feel lifted from Led Zeppelin, The Doors, The Beatles, The Kinks, Iggy Pop or AC/DC, and that's what makes this album so much fun. Jet don't play rock n' roll to save the world, they play rock for the primal energy, raw atmosphere and like Aerosmith, for the way distorted amps bring out the true vibe of gettin' some. The songs feel like coded homages, consider \\"Are You Gonna Be My Girl?\\" There is no doubt that the main riff and bass line are lifted from Iggy Pop's \\"Lust For Life\\" but with new words, yet it's such a fun jam done with gusto and style that we don't care. In fact, it's refreshing to hear a band on the radio that plays hard rock in the classic style, especially in this modern age of cheap Top 40 clones. Like The White Stripes, Jet are here to rock and bow down to their heroes. \\"Roll Over DJ\\" has this same time of energy while \\"Cold Hard Bitch\\" is angry but with a sense of humor. But like all good bands, Jet has it's soft moments as well. \\"Look What You've Done\\" is a nice ballad that sounds totally Beatles-ripped, but it works becaust you can tell it's done with heart and the production is flawless. It's a good song and that's all there is to it. \\"Get Born\\" is a taste of pure, raw rock n' roll expertly done. It never feels lazy or toned down and keeps a classic sound flowing into the new century.
B000268QB2|5.0|I absolutely adore \\"Everybody's Changing\\"!<br /><br />Unfortuantely most people will never get to hear this song or discover what a remarkable band this truely is because radio will only play songs by Usher, Outkast, and the Simpsons sisters. What a shame.
B00018D44U|3.0|Norah Jones can still work magic with a song, breathing life into an old classic or a new tune. But you cannot make a silk purse out of a sow's ear, and most of the tracks on Norah's latest were penned by Norah with bassist Lee Alexander, and related characters. Frankly, the quality suffers. What Norah needed here was another dose of Jesse Harris, whose special contributions to her debut CD not only yielded her hit Don't Know Why, but rounded out a nice selection of standards and songs of other artists. Norah's heavy reliance on herself and bandmates to supply the songs for this outing has severely handicapped it.  <br /> <br />Oh, the songs are pleasant enough, but just that. There are few gems. The country music duet with Dolly Parton is just embarrassing, I think. I always skip that one. I don't mind Norah singing country music. Her cover of Why Can't He Be You on the Patsy Cline tribute CD was a shining jewel, but that was a much better song.  <br /> <br />Probably there was a conscious effort to tone down the \\"jazz\\" aspects of her work. That's neither  good or bad. However, Norah has an appealing piano style which is an essential complement to her singing, just like Mark Knopfler's guitar -- as if the voice and the instrument are playing a duet. She should use that and develop her improvisation. The production here is too stripped-down. The band as a whole should have more room to stretch its legs improvisationally.  <br /> <br />I do not understand the reason for choosing these mostly sedate, mostly average songs for the record. A bid for more publishing money by writing most of it with your boyfriend? I doubt it, but one wonders. I have no doubt that Norah and Lee can write some wonderful songs, but I doubt they can write enough of them to ever fill out an album, unless we wait for five or ten years between albums. Actually, Norah and Lee did write some great songs on the first album, but they wrote them alone, not in collaboration. Perhaps that is what worksbest. Given the number of great songs already written, and given that Norah is a natural prodigy in interpreting great material, she should move in that direction. The genre doesn't matter as much as the inherent quality of the material.  <br /> <br />All this advice is only a long way of saying I was let down. Also, the tactic of releasing a new version of the record with extra songs and a bonus DVD only a few months after the original release is very disappointing, especially to the millions of fans who already bought the stripped-down original. Just another grab for cash to compensate for the summer tour which sold fewer tickets than hoped for? I don't know. You be the judge. What I do know is that Norah Jones needs to crank up the volume and tempo a bit, and cherry-pick better songs to play.  <br /> <br />To the people who gave this five stars: You are too easily amused.

B00005Y6YB|5.0|I borrowed the 2-DVD set from a friend with the same picture on the front as the one shown here. The back of the case says the running time is approximately 6 hrs. Amazon shows the running time as 240 min.  <br /> <br />I went to the last chapter of each of the 4 episodes and fast-forwarded to the credits. The running time was between 1:25 min and 1:32 to the start of the credits and credit time is counted in movie length. <br /> <br />There are a couple of minutes under 6 hrs of running time not including the credits. <br /> <br />I have never seen Lonesome Dove but an 8hr mini-series, from back then, would have about 2hrs of commercials. Today there would be more. <br /> <br />In short, the whole mini-series is on the 2-DVD set.
B000067DNC|5.0|Although it's hard for a Stargate SG-1 fan like me to choose, I'd still have to say that season 2 is definitely the best season I've seen so far. With episodes that are funny, intriguing, and introducing a whole variety of new characters and races, this season is hard to beat.    If you're new to Stargate SG-1, I'd suggest getting season 1 first, as it'll clear up many of the plotlines for you. Nonetheless, I watched season 2 first, and only after that went on to season 1. Season 1 only explains details that might be go for you to know in season 2.     As extras go, nothing much can be said. A couple of short featurettes that leave you wanting more, but nothing fancy. But then again, there's plenty to enjoy with just the episodes.

B00005JNJ7|4.0|The White House, upon seeing only the previews for this film back in August, issued a statement saying it was wrong to release a film that mocked the current War on Terror. Catching this in a sneak preview, I can confirm that it does mock the United States' occasional arrogance regarding international policy.<br /><br />Of course, it also mocks Korea, the Kama Sutra, the Screen Actors Guild, the TV show \\"Thunderbirds,\\" Jerry Bruckheimer films and the sad state of the Broadway musical.<br /><br />Though not a great film - and not really trying to be, \\"Team America\\" is really, really, really, really, really, really funny.<br /><br />Because it's a parody, I'm not sure exactly how to highlight its key points except to give a list of jokes that I found funny, and I don't really feel like spoiling them for other viewers. Oh, OK, I'll list a couple. There's a great, instant-classic sex scene. A great drunken-puppet scene. A great puppet speech. A great puppet obscene confession. And there are four great songs, performed by puppets.<br /><br />For an action movie, \\"Team America\\" is actually pretty good, and the plot is easier to follow than a lot of the latest action movies.<br /><br />And the idea that an actor would be able to find his place on a covert military force is sorta inspired.
B0002234LS|3.0|the reason im giving this movie 3 stars is because it was good but not good enough.the ending was so perdictbal.you didint even hafe to think hard.you already new how it was going to end.and it did vary bad at the boxoffice.
1592400876|4.0|I thoroughly  enjoyed Ms Truss' book.  As the granddaughter of a professional proofreader, and an oft-published writer of trade articles (Nursing), I have a great appreciation for elegant grammar and the well-turned phrase.  However, since Ms Truss invites sticklers to unite, I feel empowered to point out a few errors.  <br />   <br />My own inner stickler is not as finely tuned to abusive apostrophe usage as that of Ms Truss.  Then again,  I was raised never to end a sentence with a preposition, even when avoidance of same requires some stilted wording.  As Winston Churchill so aptly put it, \\"That is the sort of nonsense up with which I will not put! \\"  Ms Truss  mentions that  quote, but not in relationship to the dangling preposition to which it had been directed.  As Ms Truss  ends a number of sentences with \\"with\\",   \\"in\\" and \\"about\\", I presume that this is a lesser crime in Britain than it is in the United States? <br /> <br />As to the 'it's/its' problem, I was taught to remember it in the following way.  Since one should never use contractions in a formal paper, \\"its\\" would never need an apostrophe because \\"it's\\" must be written out as \\"it is\\".  Ms Truss must not consider her work to be formal, since contractions abound.   <br /> <br />That said, her instructions for the use of  comma, semi-colon, colons and periods are presented in a fashion that is both amusing and memorable.   <br /> <br />This work was not quite the reference guide that I expected, but it was, none-the-less, a worthwhile read. <br /> <br />Sticklers of the world unit!  <br /> <br /> <br />
0743455967|3.0|Good: Fun and easy to read. King is honest and his writing is crisp. I enjoyed his reflections on his life and on the accident that almost killed him. The chapters about writing were interesting because of his comments on how ideas came into his head and how he fleshed them out.    Bad: I don't feel this book helped make me a better writer. King's advice falls into two categories: very specific (avoid adverbs, avoid the passive voice, use \\"said\\" for dialogue attribution) and very general (read a lot and write a lot). His advice on constructing plot and story boils down to \\"create interesting characters, put them in interesting situations, and let your imagination run wild\\". Not that that's bad, it's just not helpful.    I enjoyed the book, don't get me wrong. But you should buy it because you expect it to be interesting, not because you expect it to be instructive. I got much more out the book \\"Fiction Writing\\", by the Gotham Writer's Workshop (and no, I have no affiliation with them).
B00007GZQI|2.0|Certainly this was of a piece with the time it was made and so serves a historical purpose. Perhaps there were many of this sort and there are certainly aspects that point at things like the MP's and the Beatles' own movies -- heck this is Ringo after all. Peter is not the same as many of his other films and that might make for an interesting discussion. My hope was that it would be useful in a classroom situation but I am left searching for a contemporary redeeming value other than remembering how weird things could get, or can get. I can use \\"Being There\\" but not \\"The Magic Christian\\". Is it just my own lack of imagination?<br /><br />Certainly the message is not lost on anyone today but neither does anyone need to hear it. Pierre Bourdieu \\"Firing Back\\" may be ignored as easily. This message is lost to \\"Losing Ground\\".<br /><br />It at least completes my Peter Sellers collection.
B0002MPU1K|5.0|With his sophomore CD, at the age of 21, Peter Cincotti has put together a sparkling CD.  <br /> <br />He demontrates his impeccable piano skills in each song and most notably on the final track, Cherokee (instrumental).  <br /> <br />In most tracks, Peter's voice has a very honest, longing, and yet hopeful, feel to it. The best track is his rendition of You Don't Know Me. It would be unfair to compare Peter's vocal abilities to artist like, Michael Buble or Norah Jones. The way he crafts his songs, arranges his band, and chooses of songs sets him apart from other artist.  <br /> <br />A true musician who writes, sings, and plays his own music, all in a style of his own. A stellar CD!

B00005JNEI|1.0|Interesting film that tries to foster a certain emotion by hackick up facts, removing context and flat-out lying.    Anyone who takes this film seriously should at least see if it's accurate.     Coincidentally, I knew the facts before watching this film, so 90% of the time I was laughing and applauding Moore's ability to present fiction as fact.    Farenhype 911 is a new DVD that shows just some of the facts. But, alas, those who think through their cannabinoid receptors rather than through neurons will do nothing but cling to Moore's propaganda film as an actual factual documentary.
B00005JNJ7|5.0|I just saw the sneak preview of this film, and I, along with everyone else in the theater, did not stop laughing for more than 45 seconds at a time. From the brilliant songs (the one mocking 'Pearl Harbor' comes to mind), to the complete and utter absurdity of everything that was on screen, this will go down as a work of genius. God bless this film! AMERICA! F*CK YEAH!!
B0002WYS6S|5.0|From the very first song to the last credit on the bonus dvd...this is by far the best Dream Theater, if not the best live dvd to date.  It is easy to see why this is the best combination of musicians touring right now.  From the regular songs to the extended instrumentals it is a prog rockers dream.  If you have never heard them...buy this dvd or cd and you will be amazed.  If you remember them only from the 90's hit  \\"Pull Me Under\\"  you have missed alot of great music.
B0000C7PSW|5.0|I saw Rufus in concert and I was blown away. He is a truly fabulous performer and there is honestly not one bad song on this CD. Let me begin with \\"Oh What A World.\\" Mellow song that will have you swaying your head from side to side. The best song on this CD is \\"Vicious World.\\" Rufus really created a beautiful track when he laid this one down. Has a strong message but with an artisitic touch. I would really recommend this CD to anyone who has a mellow taste for music. I rarely give a CD this good of a review but \\"Want One\\" is worth it.
0060278250|5.0|i am WOWED by this book.  The character development, (previously established for a lot of the characters in &lt;u>Lirael&lt;/u> and &lt;u>Sabriel&lt;/u> was even furthered here.  Every character has a purpose and it is the tons of little quirks and twists in the plot which make it so great.  It's not all good and bad; black and white, which adds dimensions to the novel.  The characters' shortcomings make them so lifelike, but Nix excels first and foremost in the descriptions of the settings.  The gore crows will make you angry.  Nicholas's sickness will give you goosebumps, and some parts may simply freak you out.  What a thrilling read!

B0000AFONX|4.0|It's a great album, I love it. There are comparisons to Lacuna Coil, Nightwish, Linkin Park and The Gathering, among others and those comparisons are all more or less right, considering the tone or the status of the music. If you like those above, there's a big possibility that you like Evanescence and you'll like this album. I was a big Linkin Park fan, but always felt soomething was missing, when I heard Bring Me To Life, I knew I'd found it. When I'd listened to Ev for a while, I discovered the rest of the bands mentioned above and now love them too. So don't be freaked out about the storm raging over who's original and who's not, they're all lovely bands and simply compliment each other. <br /> <br />This is the version that includes Farther Away, and the worse version of it, there's a much better demo version out there. This album compared to other Ev works has the slight sense of being over-produced and some of the songs during first few times you hear them don't really stand out. All seem to have the same guitar riff, the same tone, the same chorus. There are \\"immediate\\" gems, as Bring Me To Life, with the duality of Paul McCoy's lyrics and the angst never found so sad and desperate in any of their other songs, Going Under that has to have time to grow on you, but is probably the best vocal work of Amy Lee with too many colors to count. My Immortal, even if it might be a bit overplayed now, is still haunting and beautiful and extremely unique among love songs. There's also Haunted, deep and dark, much more goth than the rest of the album, Imaginary with it's poetic lyrics, and Hello, the dangerously quiet and downplayed chiller of a song.  <br /> <br />So just listen to it, forget the hype. The only thing you should be sorry about buying this is that you didn't buy if earlier and have the chance to discover Evanescence on your own before it was \\"the next big thing\\".
0061015725|3.0|I bought the hardback of this because I was looking so forward to a new Crichton novel. I had read Airframe, Timeline, Jurassic Park, Andromeda Strain, and Sphere and I loved them all. Prey is a mediocre novel, that just doesn't hold up to Crichton's past works. The subject of nanotechnology sounded like it could be interesting, but I found myself fairly bored with it the whole time. Crichton didn't \\"sell\\" the story to me like he did with his past ideas. I didn't feel as if it was plausible at all, possibly because the concept of nanotechnology is so new that no one really knows much ab out it. Looking at all of the works he cited, it looks like he did a LOT of research into his subject. So why are there so many problems with the logic in it?<br /><br />It seems like Crichton has become somewhat formulaic in this book. The book clearly mimics many of the themes, plots, and cliffhangers from Jurassic Park, but lacks the overall threat of 60 foot tall T-Rex ready to rip your throat out. It's hard to develop suspense in a novel where the main threat is microscopic (although it was done in 'Strain effectively, so why not here?)<br /><br />If you're a fast reader and want something for the weekend, it's not a bad read, but I wouldn't suggest spending any time or money on Prey.
B000001EAQ|4.0|I first got this album, listened to it, got a headache halfway through, and put it away. Several months later, I decided to listen to it again, but from a musician's standpoint. U2's style, especially rhythm, had been drastically altered, from the usual rock, to a new \\"looped\\" electronic style. This album takes a while to appriciate, and now it is a personal \\"underappriciated\\" favorite. Don't jude the album immidietly, as I did, and call it junk after listening once to this experiment. Try to appriciate the completely new style discovered by U2, and listen to it until your head pounds, esp after \\"Mofo\\". I'm glad U2 had the nerve to produce the album, as it broke the \\"barrier\\" they had of seeming to play only one genre of music.
B000000IRD|5.0|Def Leppard was one of the greatest bands of the mid-80's. \\"Pyromania\\" is their definitive album, and probably their best. The anthems were hard enough to be cool, yet very singable, and they still beg to be cranked up. \\"Rock of Ages\\" and \\"Photograph\\" will never get old.  <br />I would however like to refute some of the previous comments in regards to the follow-up album \\"Hysteria\\". \\"Pyromania\\" gave them the success(money) to come back with \\"Hyteria\\", their most influential album. It crossed hard rock over to AOR, paving the way for Bon Jovi et al for the next 5 years until hip-hop started taking over. \\"Hysteria\\" is a great album as well, and was much more successful. I was 16 at the time, and we all played both these tapes so much the lettering would wear off them. That was until \\"Hysteria\\" unleashed a year long barrage of #1 tracks so even our fathers were listening to it! Then of course the thrill faded. Point is, buy them both, or go for \\"Vault\\" to get only the best tracks. But don't discount \\"Hysteria\\".
B0000TB01Y|5.0|In December 2003, I decided I would go and purchase the Broadway album of a show I had heard of called &#34;Wicked&#34;... it previewed in the summer of 2003 in San Francisco less than an hour away from me, and after listening to this CD, I'm still kicking myself for not seeing it's astounding premiere!    Since then, I have traveled from the West Coast to NYC to see the production (though I came 3 sad days after Kristin and Norbert Leo Butz departed from the roles they created as Glinda and Fiyero), and it was EVERYTHING I imagined it would be and SO MUCH MORE! Now, I'm traveling across the country once again this Christmas to see Idina Menzel before she leaves on january 9, 2005! I'm unbelievably excited!    On to this album: In the tradition of a few previous reviews, I am going to rate each song (my OPINION of each) on a scale of 1-10, 10 being the best. Here goes:    Quick Overview (for those unfamiliar with the show)- Following the stories of OZ's two famous witches, Glinda the Good (played perfectly by the lovely Kristin Chenoweth) and Elphaba, the mis-understood Green Girl who becomes the infamous Wicked Witch of the West (created by the flawless Idina Menzel!)... this show explores the relationship between these two enemies wh become friends who become enemies... and so on... ALL &#34;before Dorothy dropped in.&#34; Buy this album and go see the show! you will never regret it!    tracks:  1. No One Mourns the Wicked - 8/10 Beautiful opening music, introduces the talented ensemble and features Glinda's unforgettable entrance! Also sets up some important back-story for Elphaba's character (very sad, in a way, once you know the ending)    2. Dear Old Shiz - 3/10 Kind of a pointless song, sung by students at Shiz University as they arrive to school... Interest in this song is only increased once you've seen the show (Elphaba enters for the first time at it's start)    3. The Wizard and I - 10/10 Idina's first song where she displays her range and BELTING power!The ending note will give you chills for days afterwards!    4. What Is This Feeling? - 9/10 Hilarious song, with funny lyrics that sets up for Glinda and Elphaba's &#34;loathing&#34; for each other. Very good!    5. Something Bad - 5/10 Boring song, very short (about 1:40), though Idina sings a few beautiful lines    6. Dancing Through Life - 8/10 Longest song on the album, with the most characters involved. Introduction of Fiyero (Norbert, whose voice is SO sexy), Nessarose (Elphaba's sister, who becomes the Wicked Witch of the East played by Michelle Federer), and the Munchkin Boq (Christopher Fitzgerald). Very FUN song, upbeat and thoroughly enjoyable.    7. Popular - 9/10 Glinda's most prominent solo (though a few lines of dialogue between she and Elphaba are included). HILARIOUS lyrics, very clever and fun, and it shows off Kristin Chenoweth's fun, pop-py voice!    8. I'm Not That Girl - 9/10 Beautiful song, Idina's only slow and low ballad... Heart-breaking lyrics and wonderful melody, it's a song that shouldn't be over-looked!    9. One Short Day - 7/10 FUN chorus number, cute and pretty, but not incredibly memorable. Just a fun, toe-tapping introduction to the Emerald City.    10. A Sentimental Man - 4/10 Short song, not incredibly well sung by Joel Grey, but not a BAD number. It's an appropriate setup for the NEXT song...    11. DEFYING GRAVITY - 10/10!! (like most people agree) This is the BEST song on the album by FAR! the Act One Finale, it is intense and spectular, and the GREATEST SONG Idina has ever belted her heart out to... (and she's belted to A LOT!) This song will leave a lasting impression with it's beautiful lyrics, music, and melody, and it is UNFORGETTABLE! (especially LIVE on stage!)    12. Thank Goodness - 8/10 Act Two opener... could be cut into almost two different songs -&#62; the first being more of a chorus number, has interesting lyrics and is louder and more upbeat... the second being more of a solo for Glinda. Last section is incredible and heartbreaking, revealing a lot about the character!    13. Wonderful - 7/10 Not MY favorite number on the album, but it IS very good. Great lyrics and vocals by Joel Grey, though my favorite parts are Elphaba's occasional lines throughout and singing about 4:00 into the song (she's incredible)    14. I'm Not That Girl (reprise) - 7/10 Shortest song on the CD (about :50), very similar to the first one, now it's sung by Glinda... Kristin sings beautifully, but it's too short to leave an impression    15. As Long As You're Mine - 9/10 The ONLY actual LOVE duet on the album, it is incredible! heart-warming and beautiful, the vocals by Idina and Norbert blend perfectly! it's SO romantic    16. No Good Deed - 10/10 SOOOO intense and chilling, Idina gets ANOTHER well-deserved solo with a spectacular finish that leaves you reeling!    17. March of the Witch Hunters - 4/10 Eh. An alright number (that offers a few spoilers about the show), but other than to fill in some needed information, it's not too important. (Cool references to the Tin Man and Lion or included)    18. For Good - 10/10 Great finish for the shows two leading ladies... it is gaurenteed to rip you up inside and make you cry! The singing is wonderful once again and I consider it the REAL song finale for the show.    19. Finale - 6/10 An alright closing, and is actually MORE effective while watching the LIVE show, and it's a more somber mixture of the opening and the last song, FOR GOOD. Haunting and sad, it's a big finish!    ~ So that is MY account of each song on the album! the entire CD is wonderful, and the vocal talents featured are DEFINITELY worth the price of the CD, especially Idina and Kristin.     Also, GO SEE THE SHOW BEFORE IDINA LEAVES!!! You won't regret it! (also, the show features a few other short songs, like &#34;The Wizard and I (reprise)&#34; and a FANTASTIC song [cut from the CD] called &#34;The Wicked Witch of the East&#34; sung by Nessarose, Boq and Elphaba... it's fantastic!) Trust me... GO SEE IT!    Side note: This particular Cast Recording does NOT include a plot summary inside so as to avoid spoiling parts of the show. The songs will NOT ruin the show for you, but only add to your curiousity. If necessary, summaries of the show are available online, but I recommend leaving parts a mystery until you see it Live.
B0002NRRAG|4.0|It seems that the top 40 radio \\"louder sounds better\\" way of recording and broadcasting has been applied to this cd, through excessive compression in the mixing process.  All instrumentation and singing are the same volume, to the point of distortion in some vocals and the acoustic bass.  Fortunately, the songs and performance are first-rate, overshadowing the lack of any dynamic range. Musically, 5 stars. Sonically, 3 stars.
B00005JNEI|5.0|This documentary should be a must see in high school history classes! This shows us all the real \\"stuff\\" that goes on behind the political scene. We as American's have the right to know the truth about Bush and his cronies. What a joke...other countries must be showing this as a comedy show. If there is one documentary that you will view let it be this one.
B0002TKFGI|3.0|It isn't very likely that you've arrived here not knowing that this recording is one of the first of ten legendary RCA Living Stereo titles to be offered in the high-tech SACD format. As with the earlier reviewer below, I have my own personal list of favorites from the RCA catalog that I hope to see in the SACD format one day, but I hope that when that day comes, I will not be as disappointed with the sound on those as I am with this one.<br /><br />Super Audio CD (SACD) is touted as being a better medium than conventional CD, and this has been demonstrated to me time and again. Given the possibilities, it is important that the engineers who perform the transfers from the original master tapes to a digital format pay even more attention to their work than they have in the past. If they don't, they run the risk of providing consumers with a product that is, in fact, inferior to less capable mediums, and that is certainly the case here. The previously available CD has a less irritating sound to it, and is therefore more satisfying to hear.<br /><br />I bought four titles from the Living Stereo SACD series at the same time; this one provides the poorest sound. This hasn't always been the case: audiophiles value the sound of the original LP highly. Caveat Emptor to audiophiles.
B0000AXE8I|3.0|- but that's about it.<br /><br />The big chase scene is exciting, and must have filled two scrapyards with the cars they trashed. The numerous fight scenes are well choreographed and wired. The visual style takes what worked in the original Matrix and took it a step beyond.<br /><br />But somehow, it was too much and not enough. The action scenes were technically outstanding, but just seemed to go on and on. A little more resolution, a little sooner would have worked a lot better for me. The invading electro-squid were great animation, but somehow incidental - something in the background, not quite connected to the action. The visual style took what originality there was in the original Matrix, and drove it well past anything that made sense.<br /><br />Most of all (or least of all) was the inflection infection that flattened every spoken line in the movie. It was quite an achievement to take actors as good as Fishburne and Moss, and turn their voices in to the verbal equivalent of typewritten text. As near as I could tell, the directors couldn't get any variation into Keanu Reeves's voice, but they could get it out of everyone else's so they did.<br /><br />It's showy, it's got action, it's got good effects. It just doesn't have the spirit that leaves me caring whether the heroes succeed or fail.<br /><br />And it does have an obvious come-on to a sequel. I guess the worst part is knowing that I'll probably watch that, too.<br /><br />//wiredweird
B00029LNHS|5.0|I have been a kind of fan of the Black Eyed Peas for a long time since \\"joints and jams\\"... i still love that song to date. After that song they fell off dramatically... Then in comes Ms. fine thang FERGIE and they change the whole perspective on HIP-POP...  <br /> <br />I am safe to say that they quickly became one of my favourite groups with ELEPHUNK...  They actually got someone that can actually sing and the beats and songs are INGENIOUS!   <br /> <br />The by far best song on the album is \\"hey mama\\" i love this song (even if it is not the video/single version).  This is the best dance song of the year (next to 'toxic' by mrs. ferdaline).  It has the carribbean feel to it and the infectious chorus makes me beg for more of this song... <br /> <br />There is really not a song I dont like on this LP at all... \\"lets get retarded\\" BRILLIANT!!!!!   I dont know any artist in the world (except Eminem) that would do a song like that... Too bad the people in this world dont like the word RETARDED... so they had to say STARTED in the single version but is not as good as RETARDED... COME ON EVERYONE SAY RETARTED!!! Dont be shy, you know you want to say it... LOL... just kiddin around... <br /> <br /> <br />anyways... the whole CD is excellent and should be in everyones cd collection if you dont like them or not.... <br />
1592400876|5.0|This charming and witty book is like a breath of fresh air in a world polluted by misused apostrophes, commas, and the other incidentals to text.<br /><br />Woman, without her man, is nothing.<br />Woman: without her, man is nothing.<br /><br />These aren't useless distinctions argued by people without real lives. They create religious schisms, and are even said to start wars. The marks around the words shape the meanings of those words. When they are habitually mis-used or un-used, the language loses those meanings. Truss demonstrates that clearly using scores of specimens, some collected in the wild, some hand-raised for her demonstrative purposes.<br /><br />As she so eloquently notes, even experts disagree on correct usages. She also notes that experts differ in the particular abuses that offend them most, and I respectfully differ with her on one point. As bad as apostate apostrophes may be, abuses of the dot-dot-dot ellipsis grate most harshly on my nerves. It's not the occasional ineptitude that bothers me, it's the chronic disease of epellipsis that drives me towards violence. Seeing them attacking a page in swarms, like machine-gun marks on a war-zone wall, is more than a thinking person can bear. If you don't believe me, expose yourself (cautiously) to a book called \\"As the Future Catches You\\". If those ellipses don't replace excesses of exclamations as the most annoying punctuation in history, you'll at least see support for that belief.<br /><br />Truss presents her case with charm, wit, and elegance. She presents it with clarity and with case studies, but without taking herself too seriously. Treat yourself to this delightful little book, and you may never look at your own writing the same way again.<br /><br />//wiredweird
0887306667|4.0|I would recommend that you read this book. It will help you to develop a more thorough understanding of the guidelines related to marketing. It will intrigue you to find out more about certain marketing concepts. It helps to create an understanding of how to mold these concepts to be the most effective in your particular situation.  <br />This is a very easy book for anyone to follow. It is not time consuming to read. It is not a book that will leave you confused, it will leave you with a full understanding of what it takes to be successful in marketing.  <br />For anyone in the marketing industry this is a must read. They make some very good points in this book that could help you strategically to be successful only because you took the time to read this book. For example, they teach in college generally that it is a good option to pursue line extension strategies. However, this book disagrees. It is always best to obtain information from both sides of the issue in order to make a fully informed decision for your business to potentially be successful in its endeavor.  <br />They use many examples to help reinforce each particular law. They also build upon each law and refer back to previous sections, which helps retention. They are very good at providing several examples to illustrate certain laws.  <br />By the time you finish this book, the examples help to extend the understanding of the particular concept they are talking about. You will subconsciously refer back and analyze how this example meets each of the particular laws that are relevant. It will essentially be beneficial to anyone in business with an interest in marketing.  <br />Even if someone is not a marketing major, this book explains the guidelines in such a simplistic way, that the finance major could understand their theoretical basis behind these concepts.  <br />If you could only read one book about marketing, this would be the book from which you would receive the most benefit in terms of an outstanding marketing understanding.. This book was very straightforward and has intrigued me to also read their bestseller \\"Positioning.\\" However, positioning is just repeitious and covers the same topics as this book does.  <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />  <br />
B00000G3AZ|5.0|I absolutely LOVE this film. It is very faithfull to Jane Austen's book and Gwyneth Paltrow's accent is superb, you really can't tell! I believe that all of the actors did a sensational job of portraying their characters and really sold the story. I have watched this film many times over and it never gets old. I think that making these classic films helps to draw in younger viewers and get them interested in older and more sophisticated novels.
0452282152|5.0|This gifted author weaves a mesmerizing tale around  Dutch artist Johannes Vermeer's most famous painting, creating an incandescent and luminous work of her own. His painting is a simple, though enigmatic, portrait of a girl with a pearl earring, about which little is known. The author,  however, a born storyteller, creates a living, breathing story around it, using a singular, first person narrative. Told in spare,  elegant prose, the author leaps into literary renown with this book.<br /><br />The events in the book are viewed through the eyes of Griet, a  sixteen year old  Dutch girl, whose changed family circumstances force her into taking a position as a maid in the home of a renowned painter, the taciturn Johannes Vermeer. There, the painter resides with his tempestuous wife, Catharina, their brood of unruly children, his commanding and shrewd mother-in-law, Maria Thins, and their loyal housekeeper and cook, Tanneke. The author lovingly details seventeenth century life in the Dutch city of Delft. It is here that Griet's story unfolds.<br /><br />Sensitive and perceptive, Griet is attuned to the under currents in the Vermeer household and, at first, takes care not to draw attention to herself. Still, she, the daughter of a tile painter, is curious about Vermeer's artistry and is drawn to his work and his methods. Vermeer, sensing a kindred artistic spirit in Griet, draws her into his world of paint, color, light, and beauty, creating an intimacy of the spirit between the two.<br /><br />Still, Griet, a girl on the brink of becoming a woman, finds herself confused and breathlessly desiring more than she may have. Her longing for more than a communion of the spirit with Vermeer is palpable.  It is, therefore, not surprising that  the undercurrents in the Vermeer household should come bubbling to the surface and engulf Griet, much to her consternation.<br /><br />This is a stunning literary work that fully realizes the promise that the author showed in her debut novel, \\"The Virgin Blue\\". She is an author that understands the less is often more, and she makes every word count. Deliberate and spare, her prose is lyrical in its simplicity, weaving a tale that will keep the reader spellbound. This is historical fiction at its finest. Bravo!ovel, \\"The Virgin Blue\\". She is an author that understands the less is often more, and she makes every word count.

B00005MP58|5.0|This film only requires one word. BRILLIANT!! Then again I am a firm believer that all period films deserve 5 stars unless they are really quite poor. There could not have been a better actor picked for Darcy than Colin Firth. He truly did the part justice. Though before you see this film it is best that you read the book first because it fills in the parts that you may not understand or that the film has missed out, because let's face it 4 hours is quite long enough for a story. However I do like that it is broken down into the different parts because you can get a bit tired sitting there for that amount of time (thank God for the BBC turning it into a series). This film is definately a must see for period drama lovers.
6300268470|5.0|\\"Rio Bravo\\" is an exceptional western tale of men and women joining together to confront a crisis. The film features exceptional casting, with John Wayne, Dean Martin, and Walter Brennan giving amazong performances. The rest of the cast is great, minus Ricky Nelson, who was a better singer than an actor (a great scene in the film proves this point). The film also features great cinematography, beautiful locations and sets, and an amazing soundtrack by Dimitri Tiomkin. Once again, Howard Hawks (director of such classics as \\"Red River,\\" \\"Bringing Up Baby\\" and \\"The Big Sleep\\") creates an exciting and emotional tale with great characters and impressive storytelling. Fans of Wayne, Hawks, and westerns will not be disappointed. Grade: A+
B0000035E7|4.0|Nirvana were at their hardest and more metallic-sounding with their decent debut \\"Bleach.\\" The solos here are somwhat better than on the \\"Nevermind\\" album (which just played like how he sang on a song's chorus). The guitar sound is more distorted and buzzing (hence the metal-like sound). Kurt's singing here, to me, is a bit different from their later albums (minus \\"Incesticide\\"). And his lyrics are a bit under-developed and in some cases, repetitive. Dave Grohl is absent, so no fancy drumming here. And of course, the production is lousy (but don't let that bother you since this was recorded for a cheap price of a little over $600). <br /> <br />I only list the downsides so no one that hasn't heard this album would think this would be like the band's later albums. This album offers a few gems and very good songs. From the moment you hear \\"Blew,\\" you know your in for a special treat. A great opener. \\"Floyd the Barber\\" is one of the tracks with disturbing lyrics. \\"About a Girl\\" is one of Kurt's finest and beautifully written tracks. \\"School\\" hints at the \\"teenage-angst\\" tone that would prevail in the early '90s. \\"Love Buzz\\" is a cover (I never heard the original) but it's a good \\"love\\" song. \\"Paper Cuts\\" is a twisted track with some of the most creative lyrics. \\"Negative Creep\\" is Kurt's hardest moment on the album where he screams \\"I'm a negative creep!\\" over and over (then \\"Daddy's little girl ain't a girl no more\\"). \\"Scoff\\" is not fully developed and a bit repetitive. \\"Swap Meet\\" seems kinda like a love song, but I could be wrong. It's also a bit repetitive. \\"Mr. Moustache\\" is one of the weirdest tracks Kurt had ever written, but I like it for some reason. \\"Sifting\\" is the longest track here also with some twisted lyrics. \\"Big Cheese\\" is another weird track. Nothing too special though. \\"Downer\\" sounds like something on the \\"Incesticide\\" album and is more fast-paced than any of the songs here. <br /> <br />Some of the tracks on the last half of the album aren't nearly as good as the first half. Kurt's singing is at his most unique and artistic than what he does in his later albums. The band still needed to find what they would stand for and they needed to find their sound. But it gives us all a good view of how Nirvana were before \\"Nevermind\\" and how early \\"grunge\\" was. If you don't have this album and you're a fan of Nirvana, pick up this mofo. It's mediocre, but a mediocre Nirvana album is better than anything else.
B00005JNEI|5.0|\\"FAHRENHEIT 9/11\\" is unprecidented in the history of film and politics. The ripple effect it generated is nothing less than a full on cultural phenomenon. While there are arguably better documentaries worthy of winning the Golden Lion of Cannes, this film is in a class by itself simply for the sensation it has created around the world. Having grossed nearly a quarter of a billion dollars worldwide so far, indicates that the vox populi have cast their collective vote in support of this film and the story it tells. Praise it or pillory it, history will record that for it's time, like a \\"perfect storm\\" this was a \\"perfect documentary\\".
0553278223|4.0|In the 1940's a little-known writer penned a look at life, technology, and culture in the distant future of 2002. Bradbury has assembled a collection of generally unrelated vignettes that explore Earth more than Mars.  <br /> <br />Some are outrageously hilarious, such as the tale of the first explorers who are greeted with total indifference by housewives more concerned with baking and cleaning, and minor politicians immersed in righting old wrongs. Finally they are locked up with the other space travellers. <br /> <br />A key theme seems to be the lack of space planning. People randomly decide to emmigrate, or leave their homes under duress. Upon arrival on Mars, they have no idea how to build the society, beyond bringing some of their familiar Earth items, such as luggage shops and hot dog stands.  <br /> <br />The most interesting line followed by several vignettes is the ultimate journey for technology. Robots outlive their designers and computer programs continue to initiate automated devices to fry bacon and make martinis long after the home is deserted.  <br /> <br />Bradbury also deals with the response of the Martians to the invasion. Many are killed by disease as occurred in the colonies in the 17th century. Others fight back with telepathic weapons, conjuring up images of 1920's Ohio, complete with doting grandparents, lemonaide, and trolleys, to disarm the explorers. Less easily comprehended is that many continue to thrive in a parallel world where they are not visible to their rivals.  <br /> <br />This is a good read, everyone needs a chance to reflect on our human journey of exploration and implementation of technology. For those like me, who don't care for science fiction, there is not much of it here, despite the title.  <br />
B000060P79|1.0|I can't see how you could call this punk at all? Why does it sound like Simple Plan, New Found Glory, Yellowcard, Green Day, and Blink-182 all have the same annoying nasily voiced loser singing about some piece crap?  Addicted is one of the worst songs I have ever heard.  All these bands are sellouts, who appeal to the masses.  If you want something that doesnt suck check out Franz Ferdinand, Modest Mouse, Muse, Wilco, Interpol, and of coarse Radiohead.
0790729369|4.0|This film stands as a rare but welcome example of how an atrociously bad book can be turned into a surprisingly good movie. <br /> <br />It is worth noting that the theme of infidelity in this movie is really no worse than the vast majority of stuff churned out over the years by the Hollywood mill. Even classics like \\"Casablanca\\" hinted at scenes of infidelity, and modern day award winners like \\"American Beauty\\" approach this topic with an outright sneer. It seems to me that the unapologetic treatment of infidelity accorded in this movie is preferable to the cynical manipulations that pervade most Hollywood fare. I can't quite bring myself to frown upon a theme that is as old as humanity and is too often shrouded either in unctuous rectitude or blatant hypocrisy. This film earns the right to be judged on its own terms. <br /> <br />In that respect, this film works rather well. Somehow, Eastwood took one of the most overwrought, overripe tomes of purple prose ever written, and transformed it into a moving story of two soul-mates who find each other all too briefly and much too late. The wince-inducing prose of the book is completely replaced with nuanced and restrained performances that convince us through pauses, body language and inspired acting. <br /> <br />This film shows us not only that film is capable of transforming almost any story into something worthwhile, but that film is an altogether different medium than literature. What counts in literature is the play of words, and when those words reach flights of such bombast that we must reach for the vomit bags, the writing becomes its own parody. Film, however, is a play of images, and what would be bombastic in words is arresting in imagery. This is why the film works where the book does not. <br /> <br />This film is relentlessly sentimental and will not appeal to some viewers. If you count yourself unsentimental, then by all means avoid this movie. But if you like your pancakes with lots of syrup, then thismovie rises significantly above your average IHOP fare.
B000002UAR|5.0|So the beatles early albums are pointless?  Sgt. Pepper is supposedly their best?  People born after 1970 should not be allowed to publish opinions on The Beatles.  And get spell check, little girl.
0792838068|1.0|I've never before followed up an Amazon review with a postscript, but the more provocative comments being made on this site promoting this pretentious piece of twaddle simply demand a reply.    A lot has been said about this film being an exploration of suffering; total commitment; selfless love; redemption earned through unreserved devotion; two moths drawn to the flame, doomed to suffering or death, but finding solace--even nobility--in their unconditional love for each other.    Along with this is the oblique implication that anyone who can't feel empathy for two such tragic figures is either a brute, a cad or a cynic.    It is with this last charge that all self-respecting dissidents should take issue.    If \\"Leaving Las Vegas\\" were really about the aforementioned qualities, I wouldn't object to it with nearly the intensity that I feel. But this film is not about such qualities. Or rather, it hijacks such qualities to mask a viewpoint that is ultimately ignoble and hypocritical. In short, it is a con, replete with all the tricks and sleights of hand that Hollywood has used over the years to mislead and manipulate.    This film is about two Beautiful People play-acting at being a drunk and a prostitute. The man self-destructs not for any understandable or even discernable reason, but because it is demanded by the plot. The woman prostitutes herself not because her life has skidded to rock bottom, but because prostitution is an old dodge that Hollywood can always rely on to provoke prurience.    I defy the film's apologists to deny any of this.    If this film was really as high-minded and spiritual as its defenders claim, then it should assume this challenge: replace Nicholas Cage and Elizabeth Shue with two ugly actors. Make them fat and wrinkled with bad teeth and dirty unkempt hair. The drunk would possess none of his boyish charm, but would behave loutishly and incoherently while drunk, and continually beat the woman. The prostitute would be incapable of words longer than two syllables, and would be habitually spaced out on crack. Let's see if \\"unconditional love\\" and \\"total commitment\\" will rise above authentic real-life obstacles that truly test such starry-eyed notions. If the film garners the same reviews after such a dose of reality, then detractors like I will concede its high-mindedness and spirituality.    But this film is not high-minded. It is not spiritual. It RELIES on the physical attractiveness, the charisma and the absurdly erudite conduct of its two stars to hook us. We witness not the tragedy of two spent and broken souls, but the machinations of the Hollywood glam factory reinventing two of its most Beautiful People into make-believe losers. We are supposed to go along with this hypocritical charade and feel sorry for... whom? Who is it we feel sorry for? Is it for the real Bens and Seras of the world? Or is it for the dashing Nicholas Cage and the gorgeous Elizabeth Shue?    This film is more than simply bad. I resent it because it whitewashes despair. It trivializes tragedy. It turns suffering, grief and death from an agonizing spiritual journey into a soft-porn fairy-tale of perfect teeth, perfect looks and perfect tans. I resent it because it demands my empathy for unworthy reasons. And when it fails on its merits, it has the gall to try milking my tears with overt manipulation and some of the tawdriest tricks in the book (Sera's parting gift to Ben is the act of love on his deathbed--giving a whole new meaning to \\"Angel\\").    I won't claim that this movie won't appeal to its target audience. All of the breathless reviews on this site prove otherwise. But those who wonder why its detractors dislike it so much should consider that our rejection stems not from lack of perception or feeling, but rather, from an abundance of those very qualities.
0446677450|3.0|I took some time to re-read this book and understand the perpective he is offering. I always worked hard to generate alternative source of income and cut my taxes. <br />when I bought this book, I was under the impression that this book would help me understand market economy and decide the in striking a balance between high income-high risk ventures and low risk - low income ones. <br /> <br />Pros:  <br />If someone is buying this book, then he already is thinking about increasing his income. This book re-inforces the person's belief. <br /> <br />Cons: <br />This book does not talk about all the areas of making 'safe' money. Sometimes he has gone overboard in boasting his money making investments and kind of turn off for those who feel they dont have that kind of money or are not willing to risk so much. <br /> <br />Overall its a good book.
B000002NJS|5.0|Madonna mixes dance, rock and electronica together to get her most complicated album. This should have won album of the year. Madonna travels to previously unseen territories and again grows. She took a big chance and succeeded...big time.
B00005JMXX|3.0|This really is a fun movie to watch if you can dismiss all the global warming political statements and just enjoy it.  Global warming has always been a fantasy by kook fringe groups that not one reputable scientist agrees with.  Is'int man arogant enough without thinking we really can destroy the planet which has been around for millions and millions of years before man and will be here millions of years long after we are gone.  The Earth is not this fragile thing these people would like us to believe so have fun watching this movie because it is a good movie but thats all it is, a movie.
B000001FI7|5.0|I purchased this album a week ago and it is truly great. Every song is a winner. Very similar to Massive Attack but very distiguished. It sound way ahead of my our time (at least mine). This is trip hop at it's best.
B00005JNEI|4.0|First off I want to say how pathetic it is for the writer of Michael Moore is a Stupid, Fat White Man Who Hates the US as well as the writer of Moore is just another money making dirt ball for re-submitting his article , slightly shortened and by \\"different people\\" numerous times. This is a reveiw section , state your opinion ONCE and move on.  <br />On to the movie. This was a great movie, its only \\"downfall\\" is that it was based on an already great book. This is basicaly the film version of Dude Where's My Country?, which in itself isn't a bad thing , but I was a little disapointed in the fact that there was nothing new in the movie that wasn't already said in the book. The book was great, the movie is too.
B00004X01U|4.0|Madonna does it again. A truly simple but creative album. The hooks, melodies and beats are great. The only blemish on this album is track 6, Nobody's Perfect. It isn't a well written song and the electronic Cher like voice makes it sound even more annoying. But other than that, it is a great album.
B0002Y4TM4|5.0|I recently saw Marillion in concert. Since the album wasn't released yet I didn't recognize any of the songs. I loved every one. There are several radio friendly songs on Marbles \\"Don't Hurt Yourself\\" and \\"Angelina\\" should satisfy the mainstream listeners. Eventhough, this album has a more commercial sound than their previous releases, Marillions strong musicianship and song writing is very evident.
B00008S2VG|3.0|It was a good try, she tried to expand her horizons. But her voice sounded too electronic. She should have used her own vocals and not computerize it. And I believe that the beats were not rich or strong enough.I think American Life and Love Proffusion are great songs But the rest seem to be missing something.
B000002N25|5.0|I love the sound of guitar in this album, I dont know why he did not use gibson on more of his songs. Here are the songs that are absolute gem, The others are almost forgettable. <br /> <br />1. Darling Pretty - 8/10 <br />2. Night in summer long ago - 8/10 <br />3. I am the fool. - 7.5/10 <br />4. Rudiger - 7.5/10 <br />5. Nobodys got the gun. - 8.5/10 <br />6. Are we in trouble now - 8.5/10 <br />
B000002UDB|3.0|OK... This is really not a bad album at all, but it is a bit sub-par by Beatles standards... Still, if you are a fan of the Fab 4, you should have it... <br /> <br />First, I'll give you the Good: <br /> <br />1. Strawberry Fields, Penny Lane, I am the Walrus, Hello Goodbye, The Fool On The Hill, and All You Need Is Love, are masterpieces and classics.  <br /> <br />2. Magical Mystery Tour is a great Album opener, that introduces the album (or in this case, the crummy TV special)...  <br /> <br />3. The production is very \\"Pepperlike\\", much like the compressed sound Martin made famous on Pepper... If you like the \\"sound\\" of Pepper, you'll enjoy the production of MMT. <br /> <br />And Now the BAD!!!! <br /> <br />1. Flying, Bluejay Way, and Baby You're A Rich Man are worse than throwaways... They're just bad songs.... <br /> <br />2. Your Mother Should Know starts off well, has a great classical piano break, and then goes nowhere (except to continue to repeat the same verse the second time and a \\"fantasy\\" verse the 3rd time). It's a real shame since the 1st 1 minute of the song showed real potential. <br /> <br />I suppose my biggest problem with MMT is that it is simply not a steady album. Great Songs are Mixed with some of their worst. On top of that, Penny Lane and Strawberry Fields were the 1st 2 songs recorded for Pepper in late 1966 (Pepper started out to be a concept LP about the Beatles childhood) and were dropped from Pepper after Captial demaned a single. IMO, one of the Biggest mistakes the Beatles made was omitting these 2 tunes from Pepper. At any rate, they would sound much more \\"in place\\" on Pepper than among some of the weak tunes on MMT.... <br /> <br />Still, despite MMT's weaknesses, it's hard not to own an album which contains 6 absolute masterpieces. So if you dig the Beatles, this CD belongs in your collection.
B000023VR6|5.0|Out of all the other cds he has made this is the best even better than the chronic or aftermath. If you like any of DR. Dre's music you will love this cd.
B000001EG6|4.0|First, I consider this Elton's 1st real album.  <br /> <br />This one, and the next few that followed (Madman, Tumbleweed, Honky Chataeu,) are, IMHO, all masterpieces. <br /> <br />Of course, \\"Your Song\\" is a classic love song, and the one that everyone remembers from this album. But other classics like \\"Take Me To The Pilot\\", \\"Sixty Years On\\", \\"I Need You To Turn To\\", and especially, \\"The King Must Die (an absolute masterpiece based on Sir James Frazier's, the Golden Bow)\\" PLUS the CD bonus track, \\"Bad Size Of The Moon\\" make this CD a must have....... <br /> <br />For the youngsters out there: Elton John was a great songwriter, muscian, and performer before he decided to put on a duck suit and sing about Rockin' Crocodiles. If that's all you know about him, you owe it to yourself to buy this CD!
B000003TA4|5.0|At a point this album was lvoed, and still rules. but why are these numb skulls giving it 1 stars? If you dont like it dont review it simple as that. its a good album, and it seems like this and Korn's take a look in the mirror are easy targets for idiots to hate on. I dont give your stuff 1 star reviews, dont give mine. anyway to the album, i wont waste anymore time talking about this. nirvana are great, kurt cobain would have been todays biggest rock star or one of em if he was still around. The music is cool and so is nirvana and this is way better than whhats her name again? courtney love, yeah, i dont like her. Courney's music is awful  and i dont know why kurt would go with her. givemes shivers. But i love this cd, had it for more than 6 years or somethin i guess but buy it if you want somethin good cuz i enjoy heavy metal like Korn - korn is my favorite band by the way. i love the album take a look in the mirror, it rules, stop giving it one stars... nevermind i said i wouldent talk about that anymore - and nirvana type music, which you say is Grunge. So grunge rules! i even agree that theyre much better than alice in chains. Man in the box is a sweet song though, one of my favorite songs of all time, is man in the box. Why isnt it my favorite song? cuz all of Korn songs are my favorite songs! Nirvana rules. and so does grunge and heavy metal. so stop hattin.
B0002VKZL6|2.0|Sorry Mark, I'm a big fan of your guitar style, but this CD is <br />often boring, if not depressing. I can't understand the tone, <br />it was recorded in California, the land of sun and fun. I had <br />trouble getting through the bonus DVD: too serious and somber. <br />Great musicians, but no sparks in the playing. Where is the <br />joyous sound of \\"Walk of life \\" or \\"Cannibals\\" ? Gone, it seems. <br />Well, hope your next effort brings more joy. Until then, I will <br />stick to \\"Golden heart\\", still your best.
B00005JNEI|3.0|I first saw 9/11 in the theatre when it was released, and bought it when it came out on video.  I was very surprised to find that the section where Lila Lipscomb visited Washington and had words with a Bush supporter was not in the movie. <br /> <br />What gives? <br /> <br />Dissappointing.
0553565915|1.0|What goes against my conviction of her account is her ability to remember such precise and defined details years after it actually happened. How many of us can remember what we dreamed last week, or last night for that matter? And, how conscious are we of that experience - whether it were reality or a creation of the conditioned mind? Her interpretation was too detailed, but again, most importantly, too consciously focused to be dismised as an unconscious creation of the mind.<br /><br />I'm sure she meant well by painting a picture of the afterlife for people who have lost loved ones in the past. But credibility of remembrance of details after such a long time - and - with the conscious of the unconscious is just not believable in the reality of mind.<br /><br />Read this fictional account for entertainment, but don't believe everything you read; just like this post. Make up your own mind.<br /><br />In the end, it is really just a question of faith in her experience.
0689835604|5.0|First of all, I have NEVER reviewed a children's book, let alone a board book. However, I cannot let this one go unrecognized. My daughter received this from an aunt as a baby gift and I started reading it to her at 4 months. She loved the bright colors and would lay next to me transfixed as we looked at it over-and-over again. She is now 8 months old and LOVES IT EVEN MORE!!! It goes with us on EVERY road trip and let me tell you, when she gets tired of sitting in her car seat, all I have to do is show her the book and her fussy face turns into intant smiles and \\"babble\\" and kicking legs become motionless! I am NOT exaggerating. My daughter especially loves the \\"Where's baby's eyes\\" page and giggles every time I lift the flap. The book has also become a favorite chew toy now that she's beginning to sprout teeth. I'm ordering the authors other books today so that we have a complete set. From a structure standpoint, the pages are very sturdy and the flaps are very secure. I recommend it to any parent looking to spark their child's interest in books. It certainly beats plopping them down in front of the television to watch Baby Einstein videos (which, by the way, my daughter HATES), but I'll leave my dislike for these for another review.
B00014NE62|5.0|That first tense, riveting moment when one dares to be true to one's self. Where two young men, separated by social and economic class, risk peer status and individual reputations when the flesh's unforgiving and burning truth strips them indistinguishable from the raw primal animal of human desire, where human drama and vulnerability either entombs one to an eternal Hell on Earth or releases one so that one may finally stand fully erect and human.<br /><br />I think every gay man must see himself in one of these three gay characters. The struggle to extract one's self from the raging, roaring river of life's absolute indifference to the happiness and well-being of the individual, no matter what species, is the fate of every living, breathing human being. Being gay is just one more snag. Just another twist and turn of circumstances and conditions to challenge.<br /><br />Filmed in the tradition of English good taste and esthetics, one is easily mesmorized by the beauty of every scene, the young men and their families. You can't help but want to be a part of their lives. You can't help but want to bring our modern attitudes and perspective to their seemingly unnecessary maze of darkness and desperation.<br /><br />Hugh Grant, Rupert Graves and James Wilby each do a convincing and outstanding job. Three straight actors who perform with the strength and sensitivity necessary for a gay man to be convinced that they 'must' be really gay. For they reveal us so well.<br /><br />The last fifteen minutes of the movie are some of the most powerful scenes ever captured on film. The climax of the last two minutes doesn't leave anyone unaffected. I highly recommend this film.
B00003W8NM|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. After not watching it in the theatre I was kicking myself when my brother told me how great the movie was after it had finished its theatrical release (he mentioned there was a surprise but thankfully did not spoil it for me). A year later I noticed the DVD on special and when I saw it had an extra disk of special features as well as an audio commentary by the principal cast and director I knew I had to buy it. <br /> <br />I was not disappointed in the movie or the extra material. A must have if you don't mind a bit of violence in your viewing experience.

B00003CX96|4.0|This movie has always been highly underrated. The acting is very good.  The plot is corny but very entertaining.  The musical score fits the film perfectly. The cinematography is well done. The plot is resembles a \\"Davis Vs. Goliath\\" plot, but that just makes the film that much more entertaining. <br />
B00007ELEL|5.0|The Big Lebowski is one of the best dark comedies that God put on this green earth.  The cast is extraordinary and they deliver the lines perfectly.  The characters portrayed help keep the movie going.  The story tells the tale of a millionaire who is trying to get his wife back.  She was \\"kidnapped\\" for owing money all around town.  The nice thing about the plot is that it strictly focuses on  The Dude.  We never really find out about who kidnapped Bunny or why.   <br /> <br />   I recommend this movie to anyone who is need of a good laugh should definately check this movie out.
B000089RV6|5.0|i think i'm the biggest fan of this band ever, and i beleive that even as popular as they are, they don't get enough credit... buy this album and youll see why. every song is strong.  <br />Hells bells <br />back in black <br />you shook me all night long <br />shoot to thrill <br />rock and roll ain't noise pollution <br />have a drink on me <br />what do you do for money honey <br />shake a leg <br />given the dog a bone <br />from best to worst...... Brian Johnson gets all this crap , like hes got a crappy voice and all that .. Bon scott was better blaa blaa ... Bon was really good but so was Brian ... he takes a new approach which i think fits the music better. It's incredibly sad .. what happened to Bon , but without his death .. back in black would probably not be as good as it is... and infact probably wouldnt be called back in black as it is a song in tribute of his death.  <br /> <br /> <br />This is real music ... no rap or metalica or linkin park can ever some within a thousand miles of matching this. I didn't know what music untill i was intruiged by this hard rock and roll. It is deeper than you think, it's music from the devil himself.. which is from ACDC's words. From the cool, hard hells bells to the fun, fast shoot to thrill... they just get the music right.
0767810856|4.0|This is a nice love story, a little dumbed down, but with a great message, the money may be the root of all evil, and what is important is the human heart.  This is a message that is badly needed in a very materialistic world.  Nicholas Cage is one of our finest commercial actors.  He proves is versatility in this picture.   What ever happened to Bridget Fonda?? <br /> <br />JM
B00008WT5C|5.0|This is my third favorite album of ACDC, only behind back in black and razors edge. I love this album the most because of Whole lotta rosie. this song has me playing air guitar the whole song. This band is truly insane. The thing i love about them is their attitude. It's all fun and dirty in their minds and they wont take any crap from those who think their music is bad. ( who thinks acdc plays bad music.. honestly). I also love their song hell ain't a bad place to be. I heard some one on this review thing wrote that it was a weak filler song. NO WAY!!! It is easily one of their stongest deepest songs. Dog eat dog is also one of my favs. All the songs here are great. The only one i don't like is overdose ... and it's still pretty good. <br /> <br />I would definately recommend this album to those about to rock!!!!!
B0000AQS0F|5.0|There have been quality television shows cancelled before their time.... and then there is Firefly. Hands down the best show I have ever seen. Not only do you fall in love with the characters, good and bad, the show has phenomenal direction in Whedon and beautiful cinematography. Humor. Drama. Gorgeous camera work. And great themes. What more could anyone want? You will not be disappointed.
068987474X|5.0|I bought this book after watching Oprah one day and decided to get a copy for my best friend as well as myself.  When I read it (all in one night I add) I was thinking, \\"wow, these women are insane!\\"  Then I realized that I do the same things.  I've always been able to give great advice to other woman, but never to myself.  Now, all I have to do is pick up this book for advice.  I am keeping this book not only for myself but for my friends, my niece and daughters to come.  I recommend it for everyone.  PLEASE SHARE THIS BOOK WITH OTHERS!!
B000025AJM|5.0|Time and time again we are confronted with artists who put out a great debut album and never climb that high ever again. When it comes to talking about the paradigmatic example of such a phenomenon my choice would be King Crimson and their debut album \\"In the Court of the Crimson King.\\" Released in 1969 with its distinctive cover art, this was the album that set the standard for progressive/psychedelic rock for the next decade. Except for the title track the songs are ensemble efforts by guitarist Robert Fripp, drummer Michael Giles, bass player and lead vocalist Greg Lake, keyboard player Ian McDonald, and lyricist Peter Sinfield.<br /><br />The best track on the album is the first, \\"21st Century Schizoid Man,\\" with its big main riff and jazz-rock middle section (\\"Mirrors\\"). The music is somewhat distorted at times, but that does not stop the group's musical virtuosity from coming through. As you would expect from the title, the song paints a picture of dystopian future that embodies the worst tendencies of the late 1960s, and remains the standard by which other progressive rock epics are judged. In terms of political sensibilities nothing comes close. The song also stands out because the following track, \\"I Talk to the Wind,\\" is more folk-rock and constitutes a sort of cleansing of the palate before proceeding to the rest of the album (it is actually a song members of the group had played on earlier efforts).<br /><br />The title track is not the best King Crimson song, but it is probably their best known one (and the one song that was written just by McDonald and Sinfeld). The conceit is of a medieval court afflicted by a black queen, fire witch, and other equally dark images heading for total destruction. It is a daring finality, teetering on the brink of the sort of bombastic pomposity that often afflicted progressive rock (Emerson, Lake & Palmer's \\"Tarkus Suite,\\" with its synthesizer excess is the example that springs to mind). Musically on this album as a whole it is McDonald who makes the biggest mark on the album, playing mellotron and assorted other instruments like saxophones, although Fripp's guitar is also prominent. When I was growing up the singing voice I most wanted to have was Greg Lake's, and this is the album when he sounds the best. The result is that \\"In the Court of the Crimson King\\" is one of the albums that has to be considered when you are making a list of top albums from the Sixites or in the history of progressive rock music. It does not matter that King Crimson had a revolving door lineup and that it would take them years to come up with anything close to this classic album.a whole it is McDonald who makes the biggest mark on the album, playing mellotron and assorted other instruments like saxophones, although Fripp's guitar is also prominent.

B0001YRVN4|4.0|I fully understand the die hard Star Wars fans not enjoying the additional scenes, or even the digitally enhanced version released several years ago ('97 was it?).  As a purist, I must admit that altering some of the scenes was a bit much, especially the addition of another Anakin Skywalker in \\"Jedi,\\" but the films are left with the exact same storyline, and little has changed over the years (in terms of the film itself). <br /> <br />It was about time that Lucas released the original films on DVD, and because he has done so my children can now enjoy the films as much as I did when they were first released. <br /> <br />The additional disk provides an inside and insightful look into the people that are/were Star Wars.  To me, this disk was worth the cost of the entire set. <br /> <br />Have fun with this collection, and don't worry about the changes; just go with the flow. <br /> <br />The Force is still strong with this one...... <br /> <br />
B000059Z8J|5.0|As soon as I heard that Christopher Reeve died the first thing that came to my mind was my favorite scene in \\"Superman.\\"  This is when Clark Kent has spied Lois Lane dangling from a helicopter atop the \\"Daily Planet\\" building, discovers that there are no phone booths in which to change in the modern version of Metropolis, and as he runs across the street he opens his shirt and for the first time we see the big \\"S\\" that stands for truth, justice, and the American way.  The second thing I thought about was the director, whose name I forget, who was chastised by a friend for considering Reeve for a serious film since the actor had played Superman.  The director's rejoinder was to stop and consider how hard it is to play an American icon like Superman (if you want more evidence of that consider how hard it is has been to cast the role for the 2006 film \\"Superman Returns,\\" and that apparently they have settled on actor James Caviezel, who knows a lot about playing a character considered sacred by a lot of people).  Of course, the final thing I thought about with regard to Reeve was that he was never going to benefit from the tireless lobbying he did for spinal cord injury patients ever since he began the most famous quadriplegic on the face of the planet after that horrible equestrian accident in 1995.<br /><br />The tagline for the 1978 film \\"Superman\\" was that \\"You'll Believe a Man Can Fly!\\" but the impressive thing was that audience were willing to accept a relative unknown in the role of the Man of Steel.  Reeve did not even get top billing; in fact he was billed third behind Marlon Brando as Jor-El and Gene Hackman as Lex Luthor.  Yet the whole movie hinged on Reeve, not only as the heroic Superman but as the purposefully bumbling Clakr Kent.  Of course it was a put on and with Reeve it was clear, as it would become in the DC comics about \\"Superman\\" after this movie came out, that Superman was the real person and Clark Kent the faux identity (I also liked the idea that in addition to the glasses on/off variable Clark and Superman part their hair on opposite sides).<br /><br />Richard Donner filmed \\"Superman\\" and a lot of \\"Superman II\\" at the same time and at one point it was apparently supposed to be one giant movie (think \\"The Three Mustketeers\\" and \\"The Four Musketeers\\").  But there is decidedly a sense in which \\"Superman\\" is three different films.  The first, taking place on Krypton, is a solemn and almost sacred recreation of the events that led Jor-El to put the infant Kal-El into a spacecraft and send him to Earth to survive the death of Krytpon.  The second, set in Smallville, Kansas, is pure Americana as young Clark Kent (Jeff East) has to deal with the idea that he was literally put on Earth to do something more important than score touchdowns, a lesson imparted by Pa Kent (Glenn Ford, in a wonderful bit part that deserved at least serious Oscar nomination).<br /><br />However, most of the film takes place in Metropolis and has a decidedly comic tone that is different from the first two parts.  Clark Kent is a klutz, Perry White (Jackie Cooper) a blowhard, and Lois Lane (Margot Kidder) cannot spell.  Hackman's Lex Luthor has fun going over the top, playing out his grandiose plans to his dumb and dumber tag team, Miss Teschmacher (Valerie Perrine) and Otis (Ned Beatty).  No wonder Reeve's Superman comes out of this one looking so good; he is clearly taking what is going on in this movie far more seriously than anyone else.  The sequence in the film is when Superman follows up his rescue of Lois with a series of heroic deeds that go from saving Air Force One to rescuing a cat up a tree.  Certainly this Superman has more of a sense of humor than his predecessors, although clearly in an All-American sort of way.  The ending is big in a comic book sort of way, but all the larger than life stuff is grounded in the moment when Superman weeps over the body of Lois.<br /><br />Watch \\"Superman\\" and \\"Superman II\\" again some timeto remember how good Reeve was in the role.  But to honor his memory skip the third and fourth \\"Superman\\" movies.  If you want more of Reeve then go check out \\"Someone in Time\\" (another instance of where his acting ability overcomes the problems of believing you can \\"think\\" yourself back in time), \\"Deathtrap\\" and \\"The Remains of the Day.\\"  If you want more of the Superman mythos the first two seasons of \\"Smallville\\" are out on DVD, which connects nicely to the second act of this film, while if you catch repeats of \\"Lois and Clark: The New Adventures of Superman\\" you can see the stars finally get uncrossed for the love triangle that was made up of only two people.in some time to remember how good Reeve was in the role.

B00005JMH2|5.0|I wasn't quite sure what to expect from this movie, which is based on the original Shall We Dance in Japanese with English subtitles. I loved the original, and was concerned that this remake wouldn't compare well to it. Last night I managed to see a sneak-peek of the movie and it was WAY beyond my expectations! I loved it, really; it was funny in all the right places, warm and touching (but not too much so), beautiful, moving, and well worth seeing. I think couples should see it together, but it also makes a nice family film. I plan to see it again. And if you enjoy Shall We Dance, be sure to rent the original Japanese version. It's the same story, but there are subtle differences and it's one of my favorite foreign films. Enjoy!
B00005JNEI|4.0|In former days, that is to say \\"once upon a time,\\" the greatest coup in politics was to run an attack ad once and get all of the network news shows to run it over and over again for free.  This has been true from the infamous \\"Daisy\\" commercial that was run for Lyndon B. Johnson against Barry Goldwater in 1964 to the even more infamous \\"Willie Horton\\" ad that was used to attack Michael Dukakis on behalf of George Bush in 1988.  But that standard has changed now with Michael Moore's \\"Fahrenheit 9/11.\\"  As of the last box office report, this documentary has made $119,078,393 in the United States, which does not include the take from other nations or the number of DVDs and videotapes that have been bought.  In other words, Moore has not only created a 2-hour political attack ad against President George W. Bush, he is getting millions of people to PAY him to see it.  Then again, President Bush has an entire new network behind his candidacy with FOX News, so you can also argue that Moore is behind the times rather than ahead.<br /><br />I fully understand that this being a Michael Moore documentary indicting George W. Bush for the War in Iraq is enough for most people to make up their minds about it, but I still think everybody, regardless of ideological persuasion, should see it before they bury or praise \\"Fahrenheit 9/11.\\"  I also do not want to get into the maelstrom around the documentary and restrict this review to just what I saw when I watched it this morning.  Yes, it is a political diatribe and like any political statement during an election cycle (the battle lasts longer than a year) it is filled with distortions, omissions, lies, and every other sin associated with political rhetoric.  But we know that the judgment for such things is not whether they are \\"true\\" but whether they are \\"real\\" enough to make a difference.<br /><br />Ultimately I found \\"Fahrenheit 9/11\\" was a bit too disjointed in constructing the coherent argument it appears to be actually making in the end.  Just like is the case with most of the papers I get from my students, the true thesis comes near the end when Moore contends that we should never send our troops into harm's way without knowing they are fighting for the right reasons.  That particular point is implicit at best for a lot of the film and you have to retroactively go back and connect the dots.  The reasons why the war is wrong in the first part of the film are not the same reasons that are offered at the end.  I am sure Moore abstains from providing a linear argument as part of the creative impulse, but I think there was one to be advanced here that would better serve his purpose.<br /><br />Some of the most affecting parts of the documentary speak to things that transcend this specific war.  Pictures of dead and wounded children are always going to be upsetting (add the long distance shot of a beheading and the charred corpses of Americans being dragged through the streets in Iraq and the R rating is easily justified).  American soldiers are always going to be too young to go off to war and kill or be killed.  Politicians are never going to want it to be their children who go off to die in the wars they vote to authorize.  I thought Moore trying to get Congressmen to sign up their kids to go fight the war was the lamest part of the film, partially because you know it is not going to happen and also because the technique has been done to death on \\"60 Minutes\\" and all of its kindred news magazines.  Nor does the idea that young American troops get psyched up by playing obnoxious heavy metal songs offend me because I have long understood that soldiers will do what they have to do to get through a battle.<br /><br />In terms of what is happening in Iraq since the \\"Mission Accomplished\\" banner was put up on that aircraft carrier to be seen behind Bush when he declared victory, Moore decided slants everything towards what American troops are doing to outrage the ordinary Iraqi citizens who are supposed to be overjoyed by being freed.  However, I think Moore missed a potent line of argument by becoming fixated on the \\"Mission Accomplished\\" banner instead of Bush's invitation to the insurgents to \\"Bring it on,\\" which I think is clearly the most regrettable thing the President has said while in office.  All of this just underscores that the \\"war,\\" however you want to conceive it, is obviously much more complex than can dealt with even in a three-hour tour (a three-hour tour including all of the extras on the DVD, the best of which are the comments and jokes of the Arab-American comedians).<br /><br />His techniques are no different from what we are seeing in the relentless onslaught of paid political advertising.  The parody of the title credits for \\"Bonanza\\" redone for \\"Afghanistan\\" is good for a laugh and any politician or ordinary human being having make up put on them before appearing on camera is going to look like an idiot.  I was thinking that combining slow motion shots with ominous music and an equally ominous voice over would do to Jesus of Nazareth (\\"\\"Render unto God the things that are God's'?....another religious fanatic from the Middle East...\\").  The most persuasive person in the film for me and I suspect for many is Lila Lipscomb, the mother of a Flint, Michigan boy who dies in Iraq when a Blackhawk helicopter is downed.  A lifelong supporter of the American military, she changes her mind about Iraq, haunted by not only her son's death but also his last letter in which he lashed out at Bush and the war.  In the end it is impossible to tar her with the same brush that can be used to castigate Moore for his political polemic.<br /><br />In terms of being provocative there is no doubt Moore has clearly achieved his goal.  The question is whether he is actually persuading a significant number of people to adopt his view or whether he is simply preaching (and selling) to the choir.  Ironically, we will probably no more know the answer to that question than he ever will the real reasons for the decision to invade Iraq.ng freed.

B000001YOW|4.0|Imagine a collection of songs that's ethereal yet heavy, spacey yet gloomy. Can't imagine it? Well, those contradictions make up \\"Signify,\\"  the deliciously dark album by Porcupine Tree (also their first \\"band\\" album). The band dips into psychedelica, metal, ambience and heavy rock -- and the result is a brooding, magnificent album.<br /><br />\\"Bornlivedie\\" opens with a tinny phone message and a vague, eerie sound, before bursting into the metal-pop \\"Signify.\\" But no sooner have they shifted into that heavy groove than they switch over to the gloomy grandeur of \\"Sleep of No Dreams,\\" the epic sweeps of \\"Warning Phase One\\" and the poppier \\"Warning Phase Two.\\"<br /><br />The gloomy, beautiful sound continues in the eerie rockers \\"Idiot Prayer\\" and \\"Intermediate Jesus.\\" But the best song of all is the sweeping \\"Dark Matter,\\" an epic nine-minute song that starts off eerie and low-key, but blossoms into a beautiful electric guitar riff... and coming full circle to where it started, with a cheerful tinny recording about electroshock therapy. \\"All those childhood traumas... magically wiped away! Along with most of your personality...\\"<br /><br />\\"Signify\\" sounds a little like the soundtrack for an arty horror film -- very subtle and gloomy, but also majestic. It's a bit like the Smashing Pumpkins -- minus the poet-songwriting of Billy Corgan -- in that it mixes darker rock with a prettier, quieter sound.<br /><br />The album itself feels very complete and flows from one song to another -- the only song that seems out of place is the lightweight \\"Pagan.\\" It's a pretty song, but it doesn't flow. Steve Wilson's vocals are pretty good -- his smooth voice sounds emotionless in a few of the songs, but drips a sort of detached anguish in \\"Dark Matter.\\"<br /><br />And the instruments -- aside from the usual electric and acoustic guitars, bass and drums, there's a wealth of instruments adding to the eerie feel. Hammond organ, piano, chimes, keyboard and a banshee guitar. Sounds chaotic? It isn't -- the metallic riffs and dark synth are perfectly melded in with the eerie cries and tribal drums. The resulting music is smooth and almost sensuous.<br /><br />Porcupine Tree's first full band album \\"Signify\\" is a beautiful, haunting creation, and one that fans of good music may want to check out. It's atmospheric and haunting -- just see what it \\"signifies.\\"ounds chaotic? It isn't -- the metallic riffs and dark synth are perfectly melded in with the eerie cries and tribal drums.

0393035158|5.0|Man is not perfect; Religion is not perfect; only G-d is of Perfection.  Even G-d does not expect us to be perfect, only better and to contribute ways in this world to be better.  Mr. Harris has made that contribution with The End of Faith.  Whether one thoroughly agrees with his thesis or not, he has given reason for us to think about the world from an alternative perspective.  A Perspective he documents by historical and futuristic religious trauma.  He petitions us not to lead a life of faith that endorses harmful actions by either thought, word or deed to others.  Mr. Harris says he is not hopeful but this may change in his life.
B00028HBKM|5.0|I grew up Catholic, and the death of Christ was never so vivid and real to me as this one was. Having the story drummed into me at Sunday School Catechism classes, I knew what was happening and what was about to happen to Christ, so I could follow the storyline easily, even though the flick's entire dialog was not in my native English. The torture Jesus endured ripped me to the core of my being, like no previous film about Him ever could. I cannot grasp how the movie could be considered anti-Semitic. The Jews did not kill Christ. They merely condemned him for preaching God's word far differently than they did. The movie tore at my soul, heart, and my very core. What used to be a religious fairy tale in my youth became so VERY real on-screen.
B00005ASOI|1.0|Interesting how Dario Argento is referred to so often as the Italian \\"master of horror.\\"  This is one of the worst films I've ever seen.  Not scary.  Not interesting.  Horrible dialogue.  Barely discernible plot.  Only watch if you are curious to see how bad it really is.
B000002HRE|2.0|I DONT like this album (duh) and neither would any true Metallica fan. This is just continuing the downward spiral that Load started the previous year and its at least twice as bad. I mean at least Load had diversity in it, I actually kind of liked that album (see my Load review) but this one is just BORING! There are only three good songs here and they are Fuel, Devils Dance and The Unforgiven II and no, the Unfogiven II is not a butchering of a classic, its just the original made in an alternative way, that means that they are both totally different. Which leads me to another thing. After the Black Album Metallica changed to exactly what they were against in the eighties...alternative sellouts! That is what pisses me off the most, its okay to change, I know all bands do that sometime but they went to what they were against for Gods sake! It would be okay to become death or black metal but alternative? Even punk would be more sensible than that. Oh yeah, every other song besides the three that I've listed above are exact replicas of either three, they sound exactly the same and thats what makes this album worse than Load. This is NOT Metallica, its ALTERNICA! <br /> <br />....Well, at least this is better than the dreadful St. Anger.
B00005JNEU|5.0|Wow, what an amazing film. It captivates the viewer through the whole thing. You grip your seat in some scenes watching and hoping about what will happen next.  <br />It has some beautiful shots of Texas and the soundtrack is amazing. Explosions In The Sky might really make it big with their instrumental indie rock, the soundtrack fits the movie perfectly and I can't express how much better the movie looks with it.  <br /> <br />Awesome movie..defiently one of the best thats came out in a few years..movies have gone downhill defiently. <br />
B00008H2LB|4.0|I really liked this Cd, bbecause it sounded great. The lyrics were good, and the guitar playing was great. Linkin park in general is a great band, but this Cd, has some of their best music. One of my favorite songs, \\"breaking the habbit\\" i think is one of their best song.
0553573403|5.0|this book as well as the others in the series have destroyed every other book i have tryed to read. the quality is unmatched by any author i have read. i cant even try to explain how good this book and the others in the series are. WINTERFELL!!!!!!!!!
B0001Z52S4|5.0|I absolutely loved this movie.  I recently saw this movie last weekend, and I loved every minute spent watching it.  This movie was so interesting to me.  I loved how Ashton Kutcher could fix the past and change his future.  I think the reason I love this movie so much is because sometimes I myself do things that I wish I never did, and change them.  We all know that this is not possible, but it is so fun to think about once in a while.  All in all, it was a great movie, and Ashton Kutcher is gorgeous!
B00000AFFF|1.0|...because it sticks out in my memory as one of the most distinctly bad records I've ever purchased. I can only categorize my reaction to this album as \\"allergic.\\" After one listen I was ashamed of myself for buying this record and I could not get to the \\"Buy, Sell or Trade\\" shop to sell it back fast enough because it bothered me to even have it in my possession.  Bad poetry over slow, boring music.
B00001MXXH|5.0|Ferris Bueller is a great movie and everyone should own a copy. You get to go through a day of ditching school in Chicago and see all the wonderful things to do downtown. Everybody has at one time in their life, wished that they could ditch school and take a wild trip and never get caught. Well if you were never able to do this, then Ferris can help you.  <br />Ferris has a master plan of how to enjoy his day home sick. Being a great friend he can't forget to include his best friend and girlfriend in the day trip so they are along to join him. Throughout the day many things happen that normal people would end up getting cought. This movie is just over 90 minutes so everyone should take time and watch it. You may just find your new favorite movie!
B000007443|5.0|What a difference a drummer makes. I love Steps with Steve Gadd, but the change to Peter Erskine on this record is like going from a luxury car to a sportster. The crisp style of Erskine fits in really nice with the music.  <br /> <br />I don't want to repeat what everyone else has already said, so I'll just agree that all the players are in top form on this one.  <br /> <br />I certainly encourage listeners to hear the Steve Gadd incarnation of this group as well, or even better check out Three Quartets by Chick Corea.  <br />
B0002VEX7S|5.0|probably one of the most perfect interludes in my life was when I had borrowed my mother's Lexus... leather seats, perfect stereo and a moon roof. It was late at night and very dark... I had the cover back so you could see out the moon roof, I was driving down a small road outside of Denver, CO by myself. Loreena McKennitt's 'Book of Secrets' was the only sound I could hear as I drove through the dark and the snow. A single, perfect moment.
B0002EXH40|5.0|Okay... there arent any \\"holy wars\\", no \\"peace sells\\" but its still a great megadeth album. one of my favorite. after this album it took them 7 years to finally make a cd as good as this. this cd was the last to feature the Megadeth feel. cryptic and risk were just plain boring. world needs a hero was a good overall cd, but the system has failed is a totally different band. its more like hard rock with filler solos. anyways... this cd is great it has tons of great melodies and solos. this is probably the last great Deth album.
B0000DIXDR|3.0|When I watched this movie for the first time I thought it was just another ordinary movie.  Nothing really interested me; the dancing, the love story, and the couple problems did not stop me from leaving the television set to do something else.  It was not till the end of the movie till I started to enjoy it.  The dancing scene at the end was probably the best part.  The music and the dancing just made me want to get up and dance.  Overall it was an alright movie which had a great ending.
B00000IP4H|4.0|When a band changes, it gains and loses fans. So why do bands sell out? Why not become heavier...faster...(or even release an acoustic album).... include more solos... better interesting riffs?? Why must bands REMOVE solos, get annoying vocals, cut their hair, lose melody, and become mainstream? This is one of the only bands who actually evovled into something MTV would never play. Good job, you were true to metal
B000001FMX|5.0|Ok, heres a rub. I have the ORIGINAL VINYL tucked away very carefully. BOTH albums are in PERFECT condition....Pulled both out the other night, looked over the album jackets, yes I have those too, and cranked up the ole B&O turntable. My Polk Audio LSi-15s screamed out Bad Detective, as I was taken back to the summer of my youth......I loved these guys back then, and I still love them now. Ahead of thier time. Glad to hear the last surviving members, (2), played @ the Filmore the other night. From the press release they received a warm and well deserved welcome back.... <br /> <br />Buy it, just buy it....You youngsters out there, sick of all the crap out there? Take a tip from a Geezer, heres what it was really like back when the music wasnt dead & lipsynchers were laughed off stage......
6302969352|5.0|I must confess I had some misgivings in ordering this film due to its age and the lack of special effects in the 1950s cinema. I was wrong and I'm happy that I purchased this excellent movie which is a real masterpiece. Kurosawa has made an epic film with an endless array of virtues: great characters (where young Mifune gives an unforgettable resital as a renegade self-declared samurai), a moving story of the plight of the ordinary farmers in medieval Japan, sentimental scenes, a short but lovely look to the japanese landscape under every kind of weather, great costumes and marvelously realistic actors who are the real \\"ace\\" of the film, usually speaking only with their facial expressions. The Seven Samurai is more modern than its age shows and although lacking the abundant bloodletting of modern Hollywood is extremely powerful in its battle scenes and surprisingly revealing in the tactics of the period. The proximity of the movie to the World War II years, shows why the Allies were forced to fight such an extremely brutal war in order to subdue militaristic Japan. The old national virtues of discipline, arms proficiency, courage, calmness in adversity and self-sacrifice, all so vividly shown in the film, become terrible weapons when misused.
B00005ATQF|5.0|Platoon is probably the best war movie ever but this one comes pretty close.  The boot camp sequence in the beginning  with Lee Ermy as the sergeant is priceless.  The treatment and language used on the recruits is harsh and unbearable. You 're happy that it's not you going through this hell.  When we are transported to Vietnam you sense relief for the soldiers that appear to be under less pressure here then at boot camp.  There's even comedy relief that Kubrick allows in this midst of chaos.  I love the way Kubrick uses the sniper in this movie.  If you haven't seen the movie I won't give up the identity of the sniper but it was a nice surprise.  I agree that it doesn't depict the Vietnam war as well as some other movies but it doesn't try to be a documentary.  The purpose of a movie and with all of Kubrick's work is to entertain the audience.  If you want reality watch the news.  As with most of Kubrick's work this one was again overlooked at the acadmeny awards.
B0002EXFNI|4.0|The girl next door is a really cool movie that is really funny.  Its about a porn star that moves next door to this kid.  She is really hot.  The movie has a lot of hot girls in it too, not just the one porn star.  I mean the movie is bad ass from start to finish and i would definatly recomed it for the whole family.  But still worth the watch.
B00005ATQ9|5.0|I saw this movie on TV for the first time.  The small screen didn't give it justice.  I now own a large screen TV and watching this dvd was unblievable.  It was like fliping through a beautiful art book.  The cinematography will blow you away and the story of one who goes from rags to riches and back to rags is timeless.  Some may find the movie a bit too long (there is an intermission) but I was asking for more after it was over.  Stanley Kubrick seems to always have surrounded himself with some of the most talented people in cinema.  This is what you pay a good director to do.  This brilliant man has always been shortchanged by the academy with such masterpieces as Clockwork Orange, 2001: A Space Odyssey, Full Metal Jacket, Spartacus, Dr. Stangelove, Paths of Glory, The Shining and last by not least Barry Lyndon.  The academy has given major awards to some classic movies but should have given this genius his just deserts.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|While Firefly has some spectacular CGI renders, it doesn't get lost in special affects or techno-babble dialogue.  Instead, the technology is but one piece of the storyline's backdrop. <br /> <br />The concept is simple.  Earth was used up and with only two superpowers left, the USA and China, cultures merged on some level as humanity left for the stars.  Some planets were started with precious little funding after the terraforming was completed, so those planets tended towards being agrarian with a spartan use of technology.  Picture a good western with a high tech spacecraft landing behind the gunfighter, or a high tech communications device sitting in a corner opposite a wood burning stove. <br /> <br />Anyways, at some point in time, the wealthier, more industrialized planets decided it was time they were all united under one central government.  The more independent planets protested and fought back.  Despite an impressive fight, the \\"Browncoats\\" (from the poorer planets) lost.   <br /> <br />The series is set in a kind of \\"Post American Civil War frontier West\\" theme.  There's 19th century looking individuals with revolvers, M16s, shotguns, and once, a laser pistol. <br /> <br />The themes discussed and presented put any Star Trek to shame, as it focuses on the individual over the government.  For fans of Robert Heinlen and his themes of individual rights and freedom, Firefly is for you.  If you prefer the Big Bird of the Galaxy's droppings, consisting of a Socialism utopia, you probably won't like it. <br /> <br />If you're a Babylon 5 fan, you'll probably love the show.
B0002MB7R6|3.0|Just get some popcorn, a comfortable couch and watch it once or twice, then go back to the rental store! Interesting concept, a reality that can catch us sooner than later, but similar to other movies. Average
B0002S94OS|5.0|I got this the other day finally, and I have to say I am not disappointed in the least. The production has been given a much needed boost and everything is so much better for it, and the double bass doesnt sound like youre tapping your fingernails on a metal table anymore!  <br /> <br />lamb of god has been lumped into the metalcore movement, with atreyu and as I lay dying and killswitch engage, but they are one of the only five in that movement that really stand out (god forbid, unearth, poison the well, lamb of god, chimaira) to me, while unearth goes for empowering hardcore tinged metal with lots of awesome iron maiden-assed leads, poison the well tugs at your heart strings while beating you senseless, and god forbid and chimaira go for more or less absolute heaviness... these guys punish you with a precise attack of riff after riff untill you just think you wont be able to take it anymore, and then they give you even more, and make you love it, like you know you want to.  <br /> <br />The lyrics are even more spiteful and political this time around, and this is defenitely an appropriate soundtrack to the downfall of an opressive regime, and I dont mean the one in iraq.  <br /> <br />Also, another thing of note is that they have tryed a few new things... a little more thought out melody that doesnt sound so at the gates-ish and a new found love for some of the most dancable poison the well/ candiria sounding breakdowns ever to appear on a thrash album. and there is an instrunmental (the title track), with alex skolnic taking a break from jazz to jam with log and chris poland from megadeth!  <br /> <br /> <br />There arent really alot of complaints to be found on this disc, just awesome riffs (I havent had this many metal grimaces since burnt by the suns soundtrack to the personal revolution) this is one of the best metal releases in the last five years for me easy, twice as evil as atpb and with better production... this is just a great listen, what more has to be said?
B0002KVUKM|2.0|Put together Frankestein, Dracula and some strange aliens, and you finally get a light, forgettable movie. And don`t watch it in family if your kids are under 10, they can get scared of the fast, annoying action.
B00000DC10|5.0|man... this album is so damn invigorating, its like sticking your head out of a window into the coldest most refreshing breeze ever.  <br /> <br />Its really hard to believe this album came out in '98 but even more staggering are the ammount of people who have never heard it, but listen to the bands refused had influenced. <br /> <br />This is just pure fist raising danceable absolutely furious hardcore, but there are alot of surprisingly moving moments that arent bent on ripping your head off. When dennis sings \\" I got a bone to pick with capitalism, and a few to break!\\" (and his accent only further adds to the enjoyment factor for me...for some reason or other) you just have to scream along. This album is political yeah... but the politics are more from a personal standpoint, speaking of how things such as arrogant dictators, or corporate smothering, and droning thankless full time jobs affect ones life and desires.  <br /> <br />I couldnt say enough good things about this record, even the ugly parts make the whole thing so engaging... they are not the most mind bendingly technical musicians, but these kids could play, but alot of the really complex stuff is kind of subtle. the songwriting on this album is so unconventional and refreshing, and completely satisfying, which proves that you really dont have to care about what meshes well together, but emphasise on instinct.  <br /> <br />This is one of the rawest and most beautiful moving albums I've ever heard, and its damn catchy at parts too... just buy it. it will grow on you. It makes me want to sabotage a corrupt precinct or something. this is everything you love about rock music... just buy it or steal it or whatever, youd be missing out if you didnt.
B00004RFCM|4.0|I never watched this show while it was on the air and now that it is OnDemand, I have become a huge fan of it. Why do I think it's almost perfect and not perfect? Because Kim Catrall's role is way over the top to be taken seriously and her hyper-obessesion with non-stop sex is truly bizarre. Her use of the \\"C\\" word even in joking manner belies the reality that this was written by writers out of touch with what a woman truly feels about the usage of that word even in a joking fashion. <br /> <br />Other than that, the show is funny and enjoyable with the various relationships in which the women become involved. They are about as funny as what we saw in Seinfeld. I recommend the 6th season most of all because of the incredible storylines and the great wrap-up. <br /> <br />As for this comment by another fan, \\"Note: this is defintely not something that \\"Christian Coalition\\" types will admit to liking....!)\\", sorry but as a fan of both the C.C. and this show, I have to say you don't know as much as you think. ;)  <br />
076790592X|5.0|This book tells the story of a series of conversations between a suffering dying teacher and a very good student of his, who after many years comes to see him again. In their Tuesday visits the teacher Morrie Schwartz presents his wisdom of life, a wisdom based on goodness, giving and being positive toward life and toward others. The meaningfulness of the wisdom is underlined when the reader understands how Morrie suffering from an increasingly debilitating degenerative disorder continues to appreciate life to the last. The book is inspiring and highly recommended.
B00000F169|2.0|This movie is a great concept that was underfunded in the execution. The sets and special effects are cheap and I think that the editing could have been a bit tighter as some of the scenes go on too long (you don't need to experience monotony to get a sense of what the characters are going through).<br /><br />As mentioned by others it's a lengthened version of an original short film, and you get the feeling when watching it that the makers ran out of both ideas and money during this process. Probably worth watching but not owning.
0553212621|1.0|This book is famous for it's descriptive sex scenes. Everyone in Britain ran out to buy a copy after the 1960 trial that ruled the book was not obscene under the law and that Penguin had a right to publish the book in its entirety. But while it may have been sexually explicit for it's time, it's rather tame by 21st Century standards. And in any case, the sexual relations between Lady Chatterley and Mellors take up a proportionally small amount of the book. What everyone always seems to overlook is that this book is overall dreadfully boring. There are whole chapters devoted to completely asinine conversations that have no bearing on the story and make no sense. Such as Chapter 4, where several characters have a mind-numbingly dull conversation about Bolshevism. My advice, just skip these chapters. You'll finish the book a lot faster and you'll probably find it more entertaining. Still, I've never been a big fan of Lawrence and I think his books are all pretty dull and uninteresting. This is probably the most interesting of the lot (which isn't saying much), for the very reason that created all the controversy to begin with: a story of real humans having real experiences. Imagine that.
6305949972|4.0|This is one of the most charming, and versatile holiday movies I have ever seen.  Jack really does just want to do something new, and doesn't think about the consequences, which is something everybody has done at one time or another.  When he gets warned not to do it, he ignores Sally because he really wants to do it. <br />The love story is charming as well.  It's a mix of unrequited love, friendship, hero worship, and in the end it turns into real love.  The love story sub plot isnot the focus of the story.  The story is how Jack stole Christmas.  Not how Jack and Sally got together. <br />This movie is claymation.  It also has singing.  I find that it makes the movie charming, some don't find it that way.
B00005JNEI|1.0|The problem with this country is that thier is no respect for our leaders anymore. This movie already adds to the long list of things the terrorists (or bad people) have to use against us. The sad thing is that a lot of Americans will believe this garbage. I do not disagree with everything in this movie. I only disagree with its delivery and the Liberal (Half-truth) approach by Mr Moore. I am one of the ones who has been serving on the front lines and I have been serving for over 17 years so I know the truth first hand. Bottom line is if you want to waste your money and believe in an anti-American who speaks from a Liberal standpoint only, then this movie is for you......
B0002OERI0|5.0|Don't your political feelings get in the way of good music.  This is a very very good album with a great story.  The songs are fabulous with variety in tempos, rhythms, and melodies.  There are a variety of songs including everything from classic punk to soft ballads.  Not to mention really meaningful lyrics.  Who would have expected such a good album from a band with Monkeys flinging poop on the cover of their first album 10 years ago. <br />Green Day has matured, why cant you dorks who cant enjoy good music because you let american politics get in the way.
B00008EY65|4.0|This movie has exactly the feel of a comic book that most movies adapted from a comic book go for. In my opinion only Spider Man-2 has achieved this accomplishment. The setting feels like it belongs. We have dark alleys and subways contrasted with a luxurious and opulant headquarters. The film is very sharp and a delight to the eye.<br /><br />I will not explain the story simply because it has been explained 200 times already on here. What I will explain will be why I gave this film a 4 star rating instead of a 5. For its high budget this film could have had immaculate special effects which were sometimes clearly flawed. An example is when the Devil Dawg is fighting hellboy in the subway and with each hit the other goes flying about 50 meters horizontally. This looks extremely fake and cheesy, you are ready to see wires popping out of their costumes. Alas they dont but you know there there unlike other films where you subconsciously know they are there but forget them for the sake of the action scene.<br /><br />I hope im not appearing to be a film snob looking for perfection in every scene but this film was an action flick and with action flicks I look for awesome special effects. Just like i forgave the weak dialogue for the expense of the action. I would have overlooked this flaw in choreography if it happened only once but i saw quite a lot. Of course its not defining of the film because the film is still great and it is just something that i happened to observe.<br /><br />The film is beautifully shot with exceptional settings in particular the professors study which is another contrast between the cold research building and his warm inviting study.<br /><br />GO into this film expecting to spend two good hours experiencing a great action flick and nothing more, but what a great action flick it is.
B00007JMCX|1.0|Note:  I am a patient man.  I do not have to have non-stop action (or any action, for that matter) to enjoy a good movie. <br /> <br />I purchased this DVD after reading glowing reviews everywhere I turned.  That was a mistake.  I've tried to watch this thing at least three different times (allowing a good year between viewings in one instance).   <br /> <br />SHORT REVIEW:  It's boring;  I don't know how else to describe it.   <br /> <br />Same thing goes for Don't Look Now:  BORING.  If either of these films were edited better (i.e. about 30 minutes cut from each), then there might be something worth watching.
B0002DRDBE|5.0|When I rented Clerks for the first time i had zero expectations of it. The only reason I saw it was because I saw Jay and Silent Bob Strike back. Appearantely the latter is an entire inside joke dedicated solely to Smith fans. Feeling left out and wanting to belong to a clique i decided to rent this movie but like i said not expecting much. <br /> <br />If I was ever wrong about something in my life it would certainly be this. This was a completely different film than from anything i have ever seen. Who knew that with 25k you could make a great film like this. Sure the film is grungy and grainy black&white and most likely filmed with the cheapest film out there. That just goes to show you that no matter the film quality its whats beneath the film that counts. <br /> <br />Kevin Smith is a brilliant filmaker who used great dialogue to make up for the cheap look of the film. Sure the movie takes place nearly entirely inside of a convenience store but through the characters that we meet we feel that we are travelling outside the store meeting all sorts of weird an something along the lines of idiotic people. Of course we dont have to travel because all the weirdos come into the store and challange on a relentless basis Dante the store clerk and Randal the clerk of a video store next door who spends all his time inside the convenience store hanging with Dante. <br /> <br />The quality of the dialogue is similar to Tarantino in the way that characters dont really talk about anything in particular that is plot defining at the time but later we learn that it was all intricately placed. Sometimes hilarious, crude, annoying and above all else real. We believe the characters, this is dialogue that people use in everyday life. This is the way people behave in everyday life and it is so refreshing to see something like this on screen even though it for me it came 10 years late.  <br /> <br />People relate to this film, I certainly do. Im sure at one point or another we were young, working somewhere that we didnt want to be working and going nowhere fast while it seemed everyone else was going places. This is the true essense of the film, its abily to relate to a large audience out there. It sure has related to me in a big way. One of my favorite films ever and higly recommened.
B0002Y4TTC|5.0|Its taken long enough for Blind Guardian to release a DVD, but the wait has been well worth it!Its a definate must-own for any Blind Guardian fan. <br /> <br />There are a total of 24 songs (20 on the main disc, 4 on the bonus disc), 8 of which are from Imaginations From The Other Side (Born In A Mourning Hall is the absent party, my favorite from said album so its a strange omission for me).There are only 2 from their most recent album (a good thing for those sad folks who dropped off after that album), though one of the songs is the 14 minute epic And Then There Was Silence.Its played in its entirety (at least I think it is, I didnt have a stop watch handy though I didnt notice any missing parts).Since the synth isnt overpowering in the live setting, the song may sound better to folks who hated the studio version (of which I am not one). <br /> <br />The crowd is really loud and enthusiastic, singing along fiercly to the songs.During Valhalla, the crowd goes so far as to keep chanting the songs chorus after the song ends, making the band play along to the crowd's will.They even chant it again later on in the set.I think the band must had entered my mind and learned which of their songs are my favorites, cause many are on the setlist, including Somewhere Far Beyond and The Last Candle. <br /> <br />The only gripes I have (and they are really minor ones) is first with Hansi Kursch's stage presence.He doesnt move a whole lot and when he does its a bit robotic.Though considering he's belting out that voice of his (among my favorites and only second to Dio), I can let it slide and by the third song its completely a non-issue.The only other thing is that the camera is almost never on either the bassist or keyboardist.They may not be official members of the band, but it would have been nice to see them in action.  <br /> <br />Highly recommended to Blind Guardian fans.And it you're as much of a Blind Guardian freak as I am, then you wouldnt have had to read this cause you'd be watching it right now!

B00005QIPH|1.0|<br />people that would love this cd: A lil white girl who has no knowledge of what rock n' roll or musicianships are. <br /> <br />people that hate this cd: guitarists, drummers, and bass players. <br /> <br /> <br />the stroke is not rock music!!!!! so dont' put them under rock category. The tone of the rythm guitar is enough to make you wanna shoot somebody. the solos are made by an 8 year old playing guitar for the first week. the songs all have the same beat. it's ironic how these guys are rich, but the sound of the drums/guitars/keyboards are out of a midi player. the drums sounded like it came out of a circuit city casio keyboard. good lord!!! everything is just bad! <br /> <br />to all the teenie popper who know nothing about music, this is heaven for you! :) <br /> <br />to all those that appreciate talented musicians, skills, creativity, and SOUL, dont' buy this crap. i borrowed this cd from a friend due to the hype! <br /> <br /> <br />like i said, this is not rock.  <br /> <br />listen to JIMI HENDRIX, steve vai, joe satrianni, yngwie malmsteen, tony mcalpine, led zepplin, etc.
B00000JHAU|2.0|Belle and Sebastian are a sensitive, pale group given to fits of shivering and meloncholy.  That they are bright there is no doubt, but they don't apply themselves to their work.  They don't make eye contact, have trouble socializing and have few friends.  Perhaps there is trouble at home?  I'm afraid the other bands find them to be an easy target for bullying and often steal their lunch money.  Just the other day they had to be sent home after the Smiths tied them to a tree and refused to give them back their guitars.  We've noticed some troubling self-esteem issues:  the singer is so ashamed of his braces that he refuses to open his mouth wide enough to sing properly.  Perhaps someday they'll adjust and become productive citizens, although school is often indicative of how well a band will do in later life.  Oh well...
B000092ZYX|1.0|It's been six albums now and everybody knows Radiohead by heart over and over again. They've done the rock, they have tried the electronic stuff, Thom Yorke has given us his message. Don't you get tired of it? Don't you think he should move on? (Besides it must be so tiring for the other band members) <br />Hail To The Thief is just another one of these indulgent albums that are completely pointless.
B000002NHN|5.0|Compared to the earlier effort in \\"The Mask and the Mirror\\", \\"The Book of Secrets\\" definitely has an extra touch of maturity and deftness. My personal favourite is \\"Skellig\\", a quiet, introspective piece with a scope stretching from history to religion to philosophy to wandering to isolation simply too beautiful to be properly appreciated. \\"The Highway Man\\" has a lively beat and turbulent melody that perfectly matches the content, song with passion and high spirit, concluded by a lovely, tragic theme that restores all to calmness. With it LM has definitely achieved a breakthrough in setting narrative to music. The remaining pieces are also unique and beautiful in their own ways, each a rich tapestry of different instruments, themes and moods. A truly wonderful album.
B000002JNJ|4.0|I like this cd, it's very heavy, great musicianship but the power metal vocals used occasionally like track 7 irritate me alot, hence 1 star off. Good cd I would recommend it.
B0001M3MZ2|5.0|Not only is this package a good deal, but also the best package ever to be sold. The journey Clark has taken in these past two seasons has been a very exciting and susspensful one. In the first season Clark is adjusting to his abilites so he can blend in and seem normal, but normal is umcommon in Smallville. From Kryptonite rocks and Lex Luthor, Clark has his hands full. Of course, this interferes with Clark and Lana's relationship. The second season doesnt stop there. Clark begins to learn more about his origin. Not only does Clark have interest in the caves, but so does Lionel and Lex Luthor. Can the Kents keep Clark's secret or will he be exposed? To find out, watch the first two seasons and I garuntee you won't be disapointed
B000063DGC|5.0|It's true, it's damn true. Just like Jimi Hendrix, Randy Rhoads kicked the bucket early in his career. But unlike the guitar god known as Hendrix who died in peace (and believe me being intoxicated with drugs is real peaceful!), the devil couldn't be more crueler than taking away this guitar legend from us with an airplane crash. Randy was truly a legend, don't deny it, he was without a doubt one of the greatest. The only reason why he isn't given the credit he deserves is because he died after only two major albums: Blizzard of Ozz and Diary of a Madman. When I was expecting a live album from Ozzy with Randy material on it in 1982 and got Speak of the Devil with Brad Gilis, I was devastated. Brad Gilis is great, but he is not Randy Rhoads, I wanted to hear Randy live on an album because he would never be heard live again. Then 5 years later, hallelujah, Ozzy with the blessing of Randy's mother releases the Randy Rhoads Tribute, an absolutely brilliant live album that stands the test of time. This is one of the greatest live albums next to Jimi Hendrix: Band of Gypsies and Kiss: Alive! Randy Rhoads beats Eddie Van Halen when it comes to electric virtuousity and speed. Many people said he ripped of Eddie Van Halen, but that's what they have been saying about any metal guitarist that came anywhere from 1980-1988. If you listen to Eruption and you listen to Suicide Solution the difference is more obvious than ever: what Eddie did with a hard rock sound, Randy did with a pure heavy metal sound. Now they're both equally great, but I just wanted to clear up any confusion about where Randy got his guitar playing. A must buy for any rock'n'roll fan. <br /> <br />P.S.: Excuse my friend metalgod, he was a wee bit plastered when he wrote his review so if he sounds deluded or crazy, please excuse him.
