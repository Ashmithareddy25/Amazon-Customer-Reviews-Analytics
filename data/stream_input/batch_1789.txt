B008673ZAQ|4.0|Yes, characters & story similiar to fifty books.  But smarter & more realistic than the fifty immaturity, submission & repeative boring dialog.  This books keeps your interest. Has your emotions jumping from low to high. The young character of Eva & her rich boyfriend sure have a troubled time of it all. Yet they are more realistic & charming than the fifty characters. They changer & grow.<br />I'll keep reading the series. Do wish tho that I didn't have to read both books to get sense of who is who & still not totally clear why.<br />JDRobbs In Death series books are still my fans. Each book can stand alone. With a murder mystery to solve & great side characters. Eve Dallas & Roarke can be vulnerable too.  There are Hot scenes & they too change, evolve & grow.  I hope Eva & Gideon do the same.
B005CRQ4GU|3.0|The book was very good but quite like the other diary of a wimpy kid books overall it was outstanding
B009FXIICK|4.0|I LIKE THIS GAME AND WOULD RECOMMENDED TO OTHERS<br />IT KEEPS YOUR MIND WORKING AND THAT IS THE REASON I ENJOY IT
B009FZHYKU|4.0|I do not have  cable or satelite so this works perfect and its good quality and very easy.  Wish i had all shows on here
B005WTR4ZI|4.0|Enjoyed reading on the exponential march of technology / innovation / ways of working and how it is impacting our future working and living ideals.<br />Cheers<br />Pieter
B0063IH60K|4.0|This is the best app I have so far. The  graphics are wonderful and the ability to choose the type of game you want to play is so neat.  I am new to this game and it was so user friendly. The ability to choose the  type of deal is such a great idea. Good job. I will get a lot of joy showing my friends how to get this app.
B003QF8E4A|5.0|Great movie, through acting and screenplay.<br />Streaming quality was excellent.<br />I also like the new x-ray feature ( available with some movies ).
B0083P1QUM|5.0|Can't stop reading.  Riveting.  Keeping me very interested.  The best of her last few books! A must read.  I recoomend the book without hesitation.
B004EBT5CU|5.0|CD has most of her hits on it. I play it every day on my ride to work and it gets me energized for the day.Her voice is so soulful and she has a great range.Love it, love it....
B0071XO8RA|4.0|I love all Heinlein, Dune, Enders Game and the Foundation Trilogy. While Wool is not in that exalted sphere it kept me engaged which is more than I can say for a lot of sci fi I have been reading over the last 5-6 years, especially the inexpensive Kindle books.<br /><br />I'm not a literary critic, I just know what I like. I found myself skipping a bit over some of the descriptions but the story was  compelling. There is no character that dominates the story but most of them are given enough space to make them come to life.<br /><br />Recommended.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I love this game because it is so fun and challenging a so addicting it is hard to put it down.
B008DM4OTA|5.0|This is a very cute and well made kids app about an animal hospital. There are three levels with a Heli-pad on the roof. Cow pilot continues to bring you patients as you treat a variety of animal woes. In order to heal them you have a task.  Tasteful colorful and simple this game keeps my 6 yr old interested and smiling .  The only downside I could see is limited woes the game is repetitive. Very cute oh and don't forget to clean the rooms.<br />Kid tested Florida mom approved.
B0091XRL86|4.0|Cute animation plus a plethora of Britain's funniest actors doing voice work--Hugh Grant, Martin Freeman, BRIAN BLESSED. The plot is a bit episodic, but who cares? As they say, it's fun for the whole family.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|its very nice u can look at your histry so if u hit clear on accident you can look at your history and see what it was u were looking for i use it for homework help and its great!
B009WO7NQO|5.0|Possibly the most entertaining Angry Birds game yet. Once you get to the levels on Hoth, Princess Leia can often knock down a whole level by herself--no surprise there!
B0013FSL3E|5.0|My grandson requested this for Christmas.  He really liked themovie.  I received it in great condition and on time.He was so happy to get it.
B004SOR4H6|5.0|I love the bird, I did not know I could get to twitter this way but is was so easy. It is a quick way to see what is going on.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|This game is insanely fun. I don't normally get too excited over mobile games, but this game is hard to put down. It's a game you could play for the rest of your life.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|I have many many half brick studios games and jetpack joyride is one of the best! I am a huge fan of this company! JETPACK JOYRIDE IS THE BOMB!!!! I have this game on my kindle fire, iPod touch, my mom's phone and my dad's Motorola xoom. I absolutely LOVE LOVE LOVE this game!!!!!!!!!!!! BEST GAME EVER!!!!!!!!! Totally recommend this game to you.
B007Q0OV6Q|1.0|We get a Lego advent calendar every year for our son's birthday in November. This is the first year we got the Lego Stars wars edition. So far in 3 out of the 4 days the toy did not match the picture. I will probably let him open them all so he can make the toys instead of leaving them in the bags until they match.
B00A0R42L6|5.0|It was great for adults and children.  It was full of fun, adventure, and laughter.  The kids watched it all the way through without moving.
B008TRUDAS|5.0|I love this book, many things happen, and I could not put it down so I ended up reading it in one day ... and immediately bought Point of retreat, I can say I was quite attached to Will Cooper and Layken.
B00A6PD8RQ|5.0|It was sooooo excellent in showing the relationship between mother and daughter.  How as teens we want our way but choosing the wrong path can have consequences.  My grandchildren loved it.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|i don´t know what to say, just GO READ IT, IS BEAUTIFUL! I love Travis, i love every part of this book (some times i hate Travis but i love him back really fast) you can not miss this book, IS AWESOME!
1451695187|5.0|To have such an account from a very credible doctor, verifying what many believe to be, regarding those &#34;near death&#34; experiences is heart warming.  What I was taught as a child and have always believed the reasons I strive to live a good and moral life are not just theory or speculation.  This Doctors personal story certainly indicates that those scientist and doctors excuses for why people have these experiences are not just scientific theory but reality.
B008LY9AWG|4.0|Harry is at it again and gets it done!  Moving right along harry is always sensing what's happening!  Good read!
B003YL4L0W|5.0|this was just what i order and it came quickly. there were no issues with the timing or the product. just perfectly done.
B000002O1Q|5.0|always did like this soundtrack especially Dan Hartman&#34;s nifty track.I Wanted to replace my old vinyl (so much stuff so little space) and was happy to find this.
B006SMLAMQ|1.0|This app is lousy.  First off, there is no reason for it to be so large.  Next, I'd like to point out that I cannot even add a location.  Every time I go to the location screen and enter a city, there is no way to confirm it and add the location.  Maybe it will get better over time, but I doubt it.  The only positive thing about this asp is that it looks pretty good wick does nothing for you IF YOU CAN'T ADD A LOCATION!!!<br /><br />UNINSTALLED, I'll check it again in another 6 months.
B0076DCT2G|5.0|For those that love DeMille's John Corey character, this is sure to be the next winner in the series. It has all the elements of suspense, humor, intelligence, and wise-ass attitude DeMille fans thrive on.
B005LAII12|1.0|It was all I could do to keep from walking out on this movie. If you find an obnoxious, pot smoking and beer guzzling teddy bear who drops the \\"F\\" Bomb every 10 minutes funny, then you will love this movie. I did not.
B009KHBDUU|3.0|The production of this movie saves it to a degree. Who doesn't like a 70's throwback? I kept looking at the actress who played the witch and kept thinking &#34;I know her from something&#34;, and sure enough, she was Bond's love interest in Casino Royale. Ha! Overall Dark Shadows was entertaining enough. You will probably like it if you are a Johnny Depp and/or a Tim Burton fan.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|I really enjoyed this book, even re-read it right away since I couldn't get enough of this book. I really enjoy the story line and am anxiously awaiting the follow-up to this book, The Walking Diaster.
B00A6PD8RQ|5.0|One of the most creative ways to show mother / daughter bonding.<br />Pixar's execution of CG [especially physics] is becoming alarmingly more realistic.<br />Absolutely excellent!!
B004Q7CIFI|3.0|The premise is great.  The ideas are good but it seems to be a bit slow.  Decent read though.  Interesting treatment of the time travel issue
B004T5R2HQ|5.0|James bond would have loved this.<br />Started with free then bought license.<br />Great and simple. Also good for copying notes. Or moms recipes.
B004P4S4NM|5.0|This  is a great album. I don't buy many albums so that should tell you how much I like it.
B002W2U3H4|5.0|Special effects and music are very good.  Characters are so real looking.  We hope to watch this movie every year at Christmas time.
B001AT4Y84|5.0|T-3: Rise of the Machines  is excellant as are all the others in the futuristic Terminator series. Great stuff !
B007HACDLK|4.0|What an intriguing story. I have enjoyed every Vince Flynn book I've read. A real page turner. Keep 'em coming.
B008JH5HCW|5.0|A movie that is good because it doesn't try to be more than it is.  It's a full of plot holes, poor cgi, action-packed, wise-cracking, damsel in distress fight movie with Guy Pearce smart mouthin' and lookin' good.  Most of the characters are cardboard but a few of them are very well done.  Rent it, it's worth the money.
B009NQKPUW|3.0|The movie itself is okay. Typical scifi. One thing I didn't like about the disc is that it doesnt show full screen on the tv. I bought it to watch first 3d movie on my new tv and quite disappointed that there were black bars at top and bottom of picture.
B007HACDLK|5.0|Another great novel by Flynn, hard to put down, enjoy all of his stories, they are up to date and very current with what is happening in the world.
B007U4DIM6|5.0|this was a very good price on this movie, and my sister enjoyed it. thanks, you guys are so great!
0547884591|5.0|Tim Ferriss' new book, The Four-Hour Chef covers a lot of ground, yet has a central theme that we can all be informed by: Follow your bliss, question authority, model excellence, and multiple interests can be connected in a meta-theme. On the last point, he is an example of what Emilie Wapnick calls a multipotentialite, something I identify with wholeheartedly. Tim's books are valued tools as I transact my own Hero's Journey (kudos to Joseph Campbell).
B004I9CXHW|5.0|its a pricy piece for an accessory but for keeping the functions of the oem<br />head unit, this is simple and reliable. no read errors and it is easy to change<br />out with the stock iphone adapter.
B000N2HBSO|5.0|Goodwin has done a remarkable job of giving us a vivid picture of the Lincoln years, adding a lot of information new to me, and turning the book into a series of cliff hangers, even though we know what happened and keep wishing it wouldn't. Lincoln's lovely warm personality and his amazing political savvy and sense of timing come through, as does his deep pain at what his firm commitments to keeping the union together and freeing the slaves led to. No wonder he was beloved by those rivals, even as they sought the presidency for themselves.<br /><br />Read the book and see the movie. And then wonder why our politicians haven't learned more lessons from Honest Abe.
B009WO7NQO|4.0|This is great fun.  Not happy that it was not available as a free download for the Kindle Fire and had to pay $2.99.
B0076L9W9Q|5.0|I love this band when i first heard it l was like who is this? then l found out and i was like i love this band l have never heard of a band with a girl who sings like this this is just a badass band. LOVE THEM!!!!!!!!!!!1
B00138KISM|4.0|This album is great! It may no be Alice in his glory day, but he can still rock out. I original owned it back when it was first released. Because 'Trash' was getting a ton of airplay at the time. That song is still great, but there's a ballad or two that will blow you away!
B00A6PD9I4|3.0|I was surprised at how scary this movie could be for little kids. Even my cat got scared at all the growling and barking in the final fight scene. Overall it held my interest and had a couple funny parts, but I'm glad I didn't pay too much to watch it.
B0077EBWVI|1.0|Yes, I saw the original back when it came out in theaters (1984), this new version just doesn't cut it for me. The acting is very shallow with less emotion and very little conviction. Some movies can be re-made, sometimes even better than the original! But this one flopped in my opinion, footloose cannot be re-made.<br /><br />Me and my wife were just talking and it occurred to me how to better explain. The original footloose movie is the type of movie that sticks with for years, a classic. Hypothetically, if I had never seen the original, I may have given this movie two stars. This isn't the type of re-make to stick in your mind for decades. I hated leaving a nasty review and rarely review anything let alone movies. It's just my opinion.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|This book grabs you from the first page and takes you on a ride you won't forget!  The ingenuity and courage of this teenage boy is really amazing.  I don't usually re-read books.... this is one I will read again!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|It was very suspenseful and made you anticipate what would happen next. I would highly recommend this trilogy. Very unexpected ending
B00933JL0A|3.0|It's not the worst game, its not the best. It's what you sit down and play while you're on the go or really really bored. It's the kind of game that asks you to pay for extra features and hardly gives you anything to really work with. Unless you try the game and turn out to be an extreme fan of it, I wouldn't recommend shelling out the money it asks for more gameplay. In fact, I wouldn't recommend it to anyone unless they enjoy doing absolutely nothing in a game until their energy refills.
B007HACDLK|5.0|All of Vince Flynn's books are fun to read. This one is no exception. If you like CIA type cloak and dagger stories you'll enjoy it.
0525953728|5.0|Got it for my brother-in-law and he enjoyed it so much, he was passing it on for others to read.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|lots of fun. some games are a bit small in size, but overall great. music seems to keep you going
B000Q9ISSQ|5.0|This book is now among my top five favorites.  It's a must read if you're Australia bound and also just a great all-around read.  I laughed aloud and read passages to my partner.  Extremely informative and superbly entertaining.  Bryson is supremely inquisitive and informative.  I'll read more books by him.
B000I8G5C6|5.0|Will Smith and his co-star are so funny in this film.  It'll keep you laughing and at the same time it might remind you of time when you where trying to get someone's attention of the opposite sex.  It's not bad on the romantic side of things either.  Great movie.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|it is boss and I really like it.  I like Jake the mixst<br />I also like chhesse a a q
B006ZZAMWK|5.0|This cd made my little sister happy and the product is still in use of my little sister.<br />I would love to rate this on a scale from one to ten as a ten. Amazon.com you do such a wonderful job on your products
B006YTTVHO|4.0|im not done reading it but i ts kept my interest and ill finish and even try a feww of the suggestions
B0062NAX1U|5.0|Movie has a power message and willing to share the movie with anybody that hasn't seen it.  Recommend to anyone that going through a tough time
B008673ZAQ|3.0|The story was still interesting, and it satisfies a desire for romance/erotic novel.  If you are looking for something new though, it is not.  The author even uses some of the same adjectives that were already overused in FSOG (I don't ever want to read the word 'mercurial' again!)
1435122968|4.0|A fine addition to any Lovecraft fan's collection, this anthology contains most (if not all) of H.P. Lovecraft's published works of fiction. Each story is prefaced with a short paragraph detailing the inspiration and original publication date for that particular entry. While there are a few spelling errors, they do not detract much from the stories themselves. The cover is not leather-bound, but still high quality. If I had more Lovecraft fans as friends, I would definitely consider buying more copies of this and handing them out as gifts. Well worth the price.
B002NZTZ8S|5.0|I thought this was a very nice children's movie, very Christmasy and fun to see with the grandkids.  I saw it in 3-D years ago at Disneyland, and was happy to get the movie and so we could recreate that special feeling with the grandkids again, this time at home with our OWN hot cocoa!
B008OJ291W|3.0|I bought this CD because I loved this band in the 80's.  It is a really good collection except Jeff Lynne changed the mixes a little bit.  He didn't really change the mixes in a huge way it was much more subtle.  The problem is I am a musician and an audio engineer and I noticed really quick that they do not sound as they where heard on the original albums.  I don't want to say it is bad it was just different.  That being said, the price was right and I am satisfied with the purchase...
B0044XV3QY|5.0|this 3 disc version of this movie is awesome, theres aternate endings, tons of extended footage, enough to keep you very busy for a long time. if youve never seen Avatar, hurry up and buy.
B009GEEMLY|2.0|i rented the avengers HD and watched this on the amazon instant video thro my playstation 3 it had significant volume problems couldnt hear anything half the time cranked up the TV to 40 max volume still sounded like everyone was whispering until the end when the main fight started also watched it on my laptop and Galaxy S3 phone same results poor volume quality!
B000IJ79WU|3.0|spinning the earth to go backwards was a bad idea the first time.<br />if that could happen what prevents him from doing that everytime terrible things happen?<br />and why did he go back to beat up the thug if time was reversed?<br /><br />Cant wait for the Man of Steel next year!
B00AHSMDQY|5.0|The amazon video on demand version is Very Clear Crisp Quality Movie Tho Some part havto replay to hear the characters talk very adult movie meaning any kids or background noise atall you havto watch it from the beginning lol' Beware the Blu-Ray Copy is messed up audio problems are very noticeable! static & crackling whenever thers 2 sounds or voices talking at the same time the lip synce is messed up so mouth are making faces but sound come before or after defiantly not synced WEIRD!
B0084AXZK0|5.0|and I absolutely love this book. So many great characters. Lord Henry's facetious, yet true, philosophy is really the most interesting part of the story. It seems to be behind every event. I'm totally captivated and am eager to finish the book.
B0099G3I96|5.0|An excellent comeback CD from No Doubt.<br />A modern spin of their classic ska/reggae<br />sound. I highly recommend buying it.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|I can hardly wait to get series 3. This is on of the best shows and best way to watch. You will want to see series one and two now. A love story and mystery of a complicated family in a time long gone.
B001TCHDPS|5.0|What a great sound this man has, shame he didn't get lots of air time. Bought both albums on him.
B000FA5SMK|5.0|Can't wait to read the next book in the series! Love the characters and plot twists. A great book to enjoy on a cold winters night!
B009329ZF2|3.0|Ok story Plot, descent action, the aliens could have been better designed with their makeup, but the super advanced alien never gets old.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Works great don't even have to put my glasses on to use it because of the huge buttons and display.
B008CPZNL6|5.0|I really like looking at my twitter, facebook, and news feeds on this app. Best of all, this is a free way to have Instagram on your Kindle without buying one of those knock-off apps.
B002ZG99CC|5.0|Got this to replace one lost by my son since it belonged to someone else. Also ordered one for him in blue ray
B0076DELIG|5.0|Michael Connelly didn't disappoint with his latest Harry Bosch novel.  Even though Harry is sometimes clueless about raising a teenage daughter, the empathy he feels for the murdered victims seemed to leap off every page.  The politics of police work frustrates him, but he revels in connecting the dots that ultimately lead him to solving his cases.  Mr. Connelly's superb plotting, reminding me of fishing and letting the line out a little at a time until he's able to reel in the ultimate big catch, allows the reader to stand behind Harry and watch and understand his every move.  I'm also reminded of Lawrence Sanders' early novels about the Deadly Sins, as his police detective rolled up his sleeves and got to work.  My only regret is finishing it so quickly and now having to wait until his next release.  I highly recommend The Black Box.
B007HACDLK|5.0|I like the  story's development,it's relevance in relation to the  current world events,  it's pace and  the outcome.<br />Another  great read from Flynn.<br />I hope there will be more to come.
B008KL2ITW|5.0|This book took me completely by surprise. I wasn't really expecting much but once I started, I couldn't stop. I read it on my Kindle in 10 straight hours...I literally couldn't put it down. I love how Jamie McGuire didn't portray the 'picture perfect' relationship as the majority of reationships aren't. The characters were likeable and relateable, even bad-boy Travis. I actually had dreams about this book and couldn't stop thinking about it.<br />I'll admit, the end was a bit hasty and unexpected - it seemed as though the ending was just thrown in there for one last 'bang'. One or two parts were also far-fetched (SPOILER)...I thought the fire was a little OTT, but I found myself not really caring because the book was so interesting, and entriguing, so I over-looked that part,<br />Overall, I loved this book. It made me laugh out loud, gasp, cringe, wince, cry and scream 'NOOOOO!'....all in one book, and I will admit that only ONE other book has ever made me cry. I couldn't get enough of Abby and Travis' story and I relished every part of the book. I would seriously recommend this to anyone who likes romance stories, but with a twist. I defenitely do not agree that this book should be compared to 50 Shades of Grey. I think that is an insult to Jamie McGuire as this book seems much more refined ( I have not read 50SOG and never would) and there is defenitely no vulgarity.<br /><br />In four simple words: READ THIS BOOK NOW.<br />Trust me, you'll love it.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|This series is very well written and hard to put down.  The events in the second book were engaging and unexpected.
B0058VW36U|5.0|it is the best game ever i love it so much! it's just so much fun<br />i play it every day.
1421550644|4.0|This is almost perfect, the actual books are top quality the paper, binding and print is excellent. There is just one major problem, the sounds effects. All the dialog is in English but the sounds \\"Booms\\", \\"Klangs\\" and animals sounds are all in Japanese. Considering I bought the English version it would have been nice to get the full translation as in the past versions. It is like matching a movie in close caption when I read it.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|A great character study.  Human nature on display in difficult situation.  Not just a zombie apocalypse. 5 more words required,
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|I love this kind of love story, that it tears at your heart stringes.  They are perfect for eachother and can't wait for Walking Disaster to come out.  I love the fact that the book will be written in his point of view!
B0083GQVOC|4.0|This is a true horror film. Not the kind with a slasher who's picking of random people, or people on one street. This is the truly horrifying story of a parent who has given birth to a monster, but she can't get anyone to see him for what he is. If you're a parent and want to be seriously horrified, watch this flick. It'll scare the pants off of you.
B008SOS63S|5.0|Purchased a few days after his show in Rochester, NY. To my surprise and delight it is nearly the same show I saw! Joe is from Upstate New York so this was basically a &#34;home&#34; show for him.
B007THA4FI|4.0|After reading this book, I am convinced that J.K. Rowling is a great author and not only a great children's author. Her characters were extremely well developed with proper motivations and back stories. The story too was interesting, but the hero of the book, we'll we don't get to know him all that well and he was the most interesting of all. Everyone else in this tale (or almost everyone else) are people I couldn't stand. So, although it was very well written, the story just didn't speak to me because I couldn't stand the people I was reading about. If they had been terribly interesting and surprising, that would've worked for me, but they weren't they were just petty, sickening and disgusting. Very realistic and a good story, just not one I care to revisit.
B009DJB9HC|4.0|I purchased this because of Joe Bonamassa. I was a tad disappointed in the album initially. I&#34;m warming up to it though. Musically I'm really enjoying it but I find Glenn's vocals a bit much. Had they switched up some vocals with other band members and such I'd like it more but all in all it is a pretty solid outing.
B008FPOIT6|3.0|REally liked this book for the first 3/4. About a guy who works in a quirky bookstore on the night shift in San Francisco.<br />The characterizations were delightful and mystery is involved, but the last 1/4 is tiresome and a let down.
B007THA4FI|3.0|Seems like the graphic nature is gratuitous or just added with the assumption that that is what it takes for an adult book story formula. I thought there would be more creativity.
B00991TCOG|5.0|I'm buying two more copies for friends and family. This is the best album I've heard in the last year. Her mix of lovely violin solos with electronics works perfectly. It's like watching Irishmen dance a jig in a dubstep club. If you aren't sure, check out her videos.
B009S8PEHY|5.0|I'm so happy Rod Stewart put out a Christmas CD.  I love his voice and now I can enjoy listening to him sing Christmas songs all season long.
B005LAII08|5.0|Good movie.  Not as much as the hype surrounding it, but it's a good family movie with a good story line where characters who don't understand each other (mother and daughter) come to a better understanding of each other and a good relationship.
B002NZTZ8S|5.0|My 5 year old loves this movie.  It has become a tradition that we will continue for years to come.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love the minecraft game and i playdd on my friends kjndle and i liked it so when i bought it it wont install bc there was an error. any help?

B005JLN9ZI|5.0|I am very happy with this product, espically for the price. I would recommend it to anybody. Very good quality.
B004MC0FO8|4.0|I tested Shazam against Soundhound.  Both satisfy the desire to identify unknown popular music.  In a head-to-head test for one piece, Soundhound identified it, Shazam failed.  Neither identified a classical piece I have.
1419705849|5.0|I am very happy with this product, espically for the price. I would recommend it to anybody. Very good quality.
B001TMCFFQ|5.0|Book wasexcellent and I loved it.  The character of Zoya was terrific.  The story was excellent.  Make sure to read it.

B004ZGI1V0|5.0|Always enjoy watching Mr Neeson and this film offering was exciting and nail biting too with just the right amount of twists.
B0036EH3XE|1.0|Disappointed. Season 5 was awesome i was excited to pay $40 for season 6, then the final episode happened. it just seemed cheap to put in one final surprise twist that renders the entire series pointless.  I feel kinda bad i own all 6 seasons now. I feel even worse for recommending the series when it just has a crappy conclusion. It seemed like it was going somewhere good then suddenly everyone is dead and Hurley is god \\"the end\\". It seemed like a good idea that they had to be dead to realize the alternate reality, but ending it with it being a purgatory. I'm actually pretty shocked how 10 minutes could ruin 6 seasons for me. So the whole show is about how they struggled to survive and failed. how they got off the island and still failed.
B00005JNQS|5.0|Fast shipping, great product. The movie is great for kids of all ages. my wife and i both love the movie as much as our daughter. I recommend this movie to anyone with children.
B00006L7XQ|5.0|Not a fan but this was the last album he wrote before dying. Being a musician, I do not know how he could have competed this album with so much pain, in Jesus Christ alone I place my trust. Musicians are baby's. even a hang nail can ruin a session for everyone. You have two choices in this life, make the right one.
B007XKEY6Q|3.0|This game has a good concept  to except that it never ends. There is really no winner. Plus there are only a certain number of things to draw so after a while you  memerize all the drawings. I deleted this game after playing it for a week  or too.
B005KGPC4S|5.0|1. Amazon rocks. Always good service and speedy delivery.<br />2. Kevin Smith is a genius. :) I love all his movies and this is no different.<br />If you are looking for a film maker who is willing to go places that others find difficult, who has an amazing sense of human relationships, and an amazing point of view this is your guy.  You may have only seen Kevin as Silent Bob, but he is so much more than that and this will show you that.  Versatile, thought provoking, and honest.
B0039208QM|5.0|Batman Returns is an excellent sequel to the classic '89 film. There was a lot of controversy about the PG-13 rating and for it being to dark. It's arguably the darkest Batman to date and could've passed for an R rating. Cast was great including Micheal Keaton returning for his 2nd and last role as Batman and he was the best. Michelle Pfeiffer as Catwoman/Selina Kyle and Danny Devito as Penguin/Oswald Cobblepot which it is sort of an origin about both villains and Christopher Walken as Max Shrek (Mayor of Gotham City). Plot was great, Penguin runs for Mayor after making a deal with Max Shrek. Catwoman tries to get revenge on Max Shrek for him previously trying to kill her.<br />Having Tim Burton directing and producing it was a good decision like on the original. Acting was great, action scenes are great also. Even though it wasn't as good as the original '89, Batman Returns is still an excellent sequel and good if you're a fan of Tim Burton.

B0076DCT2G|5.0|DeMille still at his peak.  Very realistic, easy to read and full of twists and turns that keep you guessing right to the last chapter.  As an aside, the Yemen locations can be followed through much of the book with Google earth giving a nice supplement to the descriptions in the book.

B009FXIICK|3.0|I first got this game on my Nintendo DS a few years back. It was an incredible time sink. I saw it in the store and picked it up. While the game is good, and almost identical to the DS version, it is lacking in one gameplay mode that the DS had. (sorry, I don't remember the name of the mode. I'm old. Whatcha gonna do?) Unfortunately, it was my favorite mode to play.<br />But, this is still a good match 3 game. I give it 3 stars only because of the missing game mode. otherwise, it would be 4.
B000W15AQ6|5.0|Just purchased this CD though I have always been a fan of Eminem. Great CD that shows all of his best hits! Definitely worth the $3.99 I paid for the music.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Another awesome book following Bared to you by Sylvia Day!<br />I can not wait for the 3rd book....I wish I didnt have to wait until 2013!
B008602KQI|5.0|I wasn't super interested in watching this movie initially, but when I finally did I was glued to the screen. My older grandkids are obsessed with the story line and characters. This movie has the potential to become almost as much of a craze as the Harry Potter series.
B00846REIS|5.0|I loved this book!...Started reading again for the 2nd time. The enticment of Ava & Gideon is exhilerating! Looking forward to book #2!
0547884591|5.0|The hacks, tips and tricks in the first couple chapters are worth the price of the book.  I am about a third of the way through.  Tim is right on the mark with his insights on learning and human nature.  I am looking at food and cooking in a whole new way.

B00992CF6W|3.0|This was my son's first experience with Minecraft and there were no directions on how to play.  It would be beneficial to have some instructions.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Holy cow. HOLY. COW. What an amazing story. I stayed up entirely too late reading the night I downloaded this because I simply could not stop reading. Finally when I couldn't keep my eyelids open one more moment, I got to the beginning of book 5 and took a break. Came home from work the next day and immediately started reading again so I could finish up this amazing story.<br /><br />If you're not a sci-fi fan or a fan of dystopian tales, don't be put off by descriptions of the storyline. At the heart of it, WOOL is about hope. It's about the hope that people have deep inside, even when they feel all hope has gone. There are so many directions Hugh Howey can go with this story and these characters, and I can't wait to see what twists he comes up with next!
B007N5YIUS|5.0|Very cool game we love it and we will raccomented to my friends. Angry birds spase it is the best?
B0086700CM|5.0|Good adaptation of a great game, very fun and easy for anyone to pick up and play. The store only adds to the fun.
B005VPRETE|5.0|I guess you can say this is a great product based on the reaction of the girls.  Lego always makes good quality toys.

B0091MW50G|1.0|I just got this disc, and was preparing to enjoy \\"Va Pensiero\\". My Sony Player announced the disc as unplayable.<br />The description says region a-1 & b-2.  I have never heard of a 2 region disc, just one region or all region. I suspect this disc is only B-2 {European} and will not play on American players. Any way I am out 9.99, as the value of the disc does not make it cost effective to return, and a replacement will not likely work either. I guess it was a bargain just too good to be true.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|I like how he keeps you guessing. I felt like there was so much more involved then Quinn. A real good story, love John Grisham.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I cant tell you how much my husband and I love this show. We are on the edge of our seat with ever episode. Highly recommend it!
B007SGLZP8|3.0|When you have read A Time to Kill, Grisham's first book (which was recognized, I believe, after The Pelican Brief), many but not all of his later books pale in comparison.  Thus, the 3 star rating.  Written by almost any other thrill/mystery writer, it would have certainly rate a 4 or 4.5.<br />Ok, that's for comparison.  Really this is a well-crafted novel, with good character development, and a good story line.  It's not one of his novels that I would likely seek out to re-read, but I would certainly recommend it to Grisham followers.<br />If you are looking for one of his home runs, try A Painted House.  (I have this notion, totally unsubstantiated, that his best books do not start with \\"The\\" but rather \\"A.\\")  They seem to closer to the author's  heart and experience.
B007SGM084|2.0|Loved reading all the fifty shades of gray books.  They are great highly recommend all of them hope they come out with more soon!!
B0052UZIFA|5.0|I thought the video was A-dorable ...... but..... should I get it on my kindle fire??????<br />I'm just curios....... should I get it or not.... please tell me in ur reviews!!!!!
B004LOMB2Q|4.0|I wish this program worked with a Stylus with the Kindle fire (any of them)!  It's a nice app, however I want to use it in a meeting where I can write things and not type them.  The nice part of syncing the notes is great if you forget the device you were working on and your somewhere else needing the information.
B001EAWMFQ|5.0|WE KNOW WHERE QUENTIN GOT SOME OF HIS INSPERATION.  THIS DUDE IS SMOKIN .  I WOULD LIKE<br />TO SEE HIM AND HIS REAL LIFE BROTHER TANGLE. (HIS BROTHER PLAYS ICHI THE BLIND SAMURI)
B0050KEVO6|3.0|I like the game, not some of the combinations.  I mean why is it 'Woman = Man + milk' when compared to 'Man = beast + life'.  So, what we're telling people is that without man we wouldn't be here.  Well, isn't the same true of woman?  It also won't let you create women in certain roles like 'doctor' and 'scientist'.  What are we teaching our kids?  Woman/girls aren't good enough to be in these fields?
B001E45XT4|5.0|This headset has lasted me for a couple years now.  Great quality headset and at a great price.  God brand name.  Very comfortable.  I would buy again.
B002PEP4SC|3.0|This is, of course, a fictional book, written by a fictional author.  As such, it is a thinly veiled story based upon the characters in the television series &#34;Castle,&#34; but not REALLY about those characters.  As a result, it doesn't completely satisfy.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Couldn't put it down! From beginning to end this book series keeps you captivated. Now what book to read next
B00000ADG2|3.0|I received this cd on time and undamaged, However it seems as if some of the songs are missing. It is a very short cd. Would not recommend this product.
B00005JPKE|1.0|Brand new DVD freezes in at least a half dozen places.  Didn't cost much so it wasn't worth returning.  I'll look for a used replacement in a second-hand store.  I buy second-hand DVDs and sometimes find this problem but a new DVD should work properly.
B0080YGZ20|5.0|I used to sing soulful alternative and have super finicky taste in music.  She's like Portishead meets Amy Winehouse meets Billi Holiday meets Genesis ... It's insanity.  I dig for good music.  Struck Oil.  Come play the US, Kimbra, I will totally come to your show!
B006XF5BTG|5.0|This gives great insight and useful tips to age gracefully. The meals a simple enough for a non cook like me

0061120081|5.0|pleasantly surprised at the sturdy construction of this paperback.  I expected the usual 'soft' copy.  This is like the 'poor man's version' of a hard back!!
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I enjoyed this one more than the 1st in the series. Seems to break away from the 50 Shades trend a little bit more. Couldn't put this book down.
B007HACDLK|4.0|There are NO Flynn bad books! Really like the Rapp series but not happy that he's growing older....... I'm looking forward to many more.
B007LB5MF4|5.0|Stays true to George R R Martin and his vision a must reed for true fans of the books and show alike.
B008NW67E0|5.0|I 'steal' all music at first.  I like to listen to an album all the way through to see what songs from the artists are worth listening to.  I usually find one or two songs on an album that make the cut and then I purchase those and scrap the rest.<br /><br />The first time I heard this album I didn't think much of it because I wasn't paying too much attention to it, but the first time I really listened to this album I started to really like it.  The more I listened, the more I liked it.  Then I realized that I don't just like this album, I frickin' love it. All of it, every last song. I can put the album on and not once feel compelled to press skip.  I went ahead and gladly purchased two copies without having to feel like I was being robbed.<br /><br />I've listened to this band everyday for over a month now and I've yet to get tired of them. These guys are sincere, genuine, and talented.  The songs and lyrics are beautiful and every one is worth listening to.<br /><br />Buy the album, it will satisfy.<br /><br />P.S. Their version of The Boxer is better than Simon and Garfunkel's.
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|I bought this movie for me( im the mom ;)<br />My kidos love it too. Great movie for the whole family.
B006ZNRD06|1.0|Firstly, it is important to note that this is a trial version that only works for 7 days. The full version is $5, which would be fine if this app even worked a little bit. I wouldn't know since no matter how hard I tried, I couldn't get the app to recognize ANY of the 10 avi videos I had loaded on my SD card. It refused to even show them in my library on my Nabi 2 in Daddy mode. Don't waste your time with this one. Even the stock video player opened half the files.
B00127RAJY|5.0|Brand new DVD. Great workout session. For those of you who claim you dont have time to workout, only 30 min and you will feel like you were at the gym for hours. Great low price also! I bsolutely LOVE it!
B003P9VZ0W|5.0|Earlier this year, I bought these wall decorations for my nieces who turned three and they love them!  Right on time to transition from toddlerhood to girldom.  I saw both girls' rooms again recently with them up and they looked great.  One of them particularly liked that there were so many of the Disney princesses were included.
B009HSVHV2|5.0|I think this is one of the best albums. I've always liked Kiss. Their last few albums just don't compare to this one.

1419705849|5.0|The book arrived very quickly, which is very pleasing.  I cannot rate the book though because it is a gift.
B005EGXTHG|5.0|Excellent read.. Well written, keeps reader wanting to read to know what happens next.. Very weird story line, which makes it more intriguing...
B006LSZECO|5.0|While I cannot rate the content of this book, as I have not read it yet, it downloaded perfectly to my Kindle!
B007KOYEOC|5.0|The first 2 books were awesome and this is the icing on the cake... Wonder if the Author will continue and do more follow up, or from Christians point of view...
B0058YPL66|5.0|I never thought I could love any TV show more than, say, Babylon 5 - or Mork and Mindy - or Friends - or The Vampire Diaries (Delena forever!), but I was wrong. I flat out LOVE Once Upon a Time, and, of course, it all started with Robert Carlyle. Now I actually own all those DVDs, and I can watch them all day every day if I so choose. Life is good.

B007V65R54|5.0|The signal is strong in this book. The section on Bayesian formulas alone makes the book worth it. The wonderful in-depth explorations of different kinds of predictive industries was fascinating and entertaining at the same time. Fantastic book, and well worth a purchase by any one who (like me) blogs, writes research studies, tweets, etc. Be a forecaster, not a pontificator!
B007L3BMGA|5.0|Awesome book, well written.. Keeps reader hooked on every word.. So hard to put down..Can't wait to read the next one!!
B000H4TX9I|5.0|Even with only one season, this series easily bests most of the other multi-season shows. Why did they cancel it? I'll never know. Glad they did the movie though.
B006OAB3ME|5.0|Hearing Paul in his older years, singing the good old songs and yet still writing new songs with very sweet lyrics.  He's the man!
B0071XO8RA|4.0|This book is  very good sic-fi. Well written, unique plot, and lots and lots of surprises! So why not five stars<br /><br />you may ask? The twists are so dark it's like being pulled into a black hole of despair. Be warned.
B008WCP2PG|3.0|Half naked guys:check<br />Plot:there was one?<br />Yep, that's really all there is to this movie but I do own a copy for girls nights!
B000JQUKKU|5.0|This is a good lesson learned book and brings to mind in reading the importance of sharing with joy. All should learn from this book s message.
B0042VJ1PI|3.0|I read Heat Rises just before reading this one (Naked Heat), and I feel that this book is not nearly as good as Heat Rises. Heat Rises was a much more solid read.<br /><br />This book reminds me of the TV show (which I've never seen), with lots of little quips and dumb wordplay between the characters like you might need for shallow entertainment. Quite a bit of unbelievable action in it too.<br /><br />The whole book and plot seemed pretty flat to me. The characters were going through the scenes and speaking their lines, but lots of it seemed flat and lifeless.<br /><br />I would not recommend this book to anyone when there are better ones out there. Thank heavens I was able to get this one as a Kindle daily deal price.
B007TXN4TK|4.0|It wont teach youbto play the piano but it is a fun way to pass the time. i love this app, addictive

B00846REIS|5.0|I read this book after finishing the &#34;Shades&#34; books.  I'm afraid authors will have to really start using their imagination not to replicate the &#34;Shades&#34; book.  Sylvia did a pretty good job.  It's nice to see the female charter mature and worldly, not some 20ish virgin.  The follow up &#34;Reflections in You&#34; is good too
B0053O89RY|5.0|No doubt some of TV's best comedy writing and acting ever.  Sometimes watching more than one episode at a time makes me laugh so much I have to take a break!  The timing, the characters, and the almost-real life situations all come together and make this my all-time favorite comedy series.  Looking forward to the next season.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I could write a desertion if I had time, but I won't.  We have been talking about this book all year.  I truly loved the story.  Christian could be a little older, but still damn sexy.  I have seen a change in so many female friends after reading the books.  Women have a renewed sensual awareness of themselves. They are allowing themselves to dream and fantasize AND talk to other women about it.  After &#34;Greys&#34; I started reading other real &#34;BDSM&#34; work-wow..<br />I loved how E L James wrote the sex scenes.  She showed restraint and respect to the charters and readers.

B0094EDBM2|5.0|I have just finished listening to the remastered version of Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness all the way through with all the bonus material and all I can say is: WOW! As with Gish and Siamese Dream, the remastering of this one is well down. The sound recording is much clearer and the drum sound is much more defined. Like all remastering these days, there is much more emphasis on high end and mid range and in many ways, that changes the sound of a record the first you heard it and will always change it. For some, that's not always a good thing and many of them will go back to the original CD or vinyl. I have all SP stuff in both formats and will be getting all the remasters, but I will keep my originals in order to have something to reference the remasters to.<br /><br />Most people that listen to the new SP remasters tend to believe that the job was well done and I have to agree. With MCIS, I read one review where the remastering was kind of unnecessary. After listening, I know what that person is talking about because the volume levels are about the same, which was not the case with with Gish and Siamese Dream, the remasters being hotter for sure.  But, I found the sound is much clearer and defined. The only thing I do miss, and people that have heard the original will know what I am talking about, is the bassiness (I don't know if that's a proper word) of the original. Siamese Dream and MCIS are truly two of the most bassiest (again, not sure if it's a word) albums ever recorded. On songs like \\"Tales of a Scorched Earth\\" and \\"Jellybelly\\" are where this becomes really apparent and I kind of miss the muddy sound of the original release, especially on \\"Tales of a Scorched Earth.\\" However, the intro of \\"Love\\" has a slightly different flanging sound on the remaster which I thought sounded kind of cool. I always wondered were the DOOM explosion was and can hear it clearly on \\"Where Boys Fear to Tread.\\" For the most part in my opinion, any one will really enjoy the clearer sound of the remasters. And that's what remasters are based upon, other people's opinions. Some people really hate remastered recording and some people love them. I personally have not been disappointed with any of the Pumpkins's past remasters and MCIS is no exception.<br /><br />The reason most of us hardcore fans couldn't wait to get out hands on the reissues were the bonus material. No SP fan with be disappointed and will find it interesting how they created such as unique, complex and utterly beautiful record that will stand the test of time. I believe people will be listening to MCIS forever and it's fascinating to hear many of the songs in their stripped down and simple acoustic forms or all out jamming by the band. Those familiar with MCIS Demos will find that the reissues have been cleaned up and sound as if Billy recorded them with his Tascam 8 track cassette recorder yesterday in his bedroom. They are amazing and I love the bonus takes and mixes of many of the songs that are included. I always wondered where the they got the end of \\"Thru the Eyes of Ruby\\" and now I know.  Again, maybe some of the mixes were unnecessary and there are some track that do not need repeated listening, but I found them intriguing and any SP fan will find them an excellent addition to their collection. The only track that is missing from the bonus CD is \\"Infinite Sadness.\\" It should have been included in the bonus material.<br /><br />I have not listened to the vinyl reissue of this one yet as I live in another country and have only ordered it. I have have had a chance to listen to both the Gish and Siamese Dream remasters on vinyl and all I can say again is: WOW! In some ways, they sound better than the original. And this is from some one who own both (I own 2 copies of each on both labels if that makes sense) the Caroline and HUT versions of both records as well as a South Korea (the country I'm living in now by the way) issue of Gish. I also own 2 copy of the 90's HUT pressing of MCIS (one signed by the band believe it or not) The remasters sound excellent. And this is from someone that has the originals on both label (the HUT release for Gish is remastered fromt he Caroline release and the Siamese Dream on HUT is superior to the Caroline release) and thought there was no way to improve on them. Again, I do miss the bassy sound of the originals, but there is much more depth of sound. When I do get back to the States and have a chance to listen to the vinyl, I will submit a new review. As of now, I will have to go on my experience with the past remasters of the vinyl and all I can say is that they sounded great. As mentioned, I have 2 copies of MCIS and will listen to both back to back. The original vinyl issue sounded awesome and are 2 of the jewels of my vinyl collection. I hope that the remasters will sound just as good. If nothing else, at least I have another copy on hand, and a remastered copy at that. The original HUT release of MCIS was one of the most flawless pieces of vinyl pressed and I'm eager to compare the two.<br /><br />*Note: I've read a lot of reviews of the vinyl and have been hearing that most people are really unhappy with the sound quality of the remastered vinyl. Unfortunately with a lot of pressing plant these days, this is starting to become more and more common. I've purchased vinyl that was just horrid. It seems like it's just like hitting a baseball, some times you hit the ball right on the mark, sometimes you hit a foul ball, and sometimes you strike out. From what I've been reading, it's more of a foul ball. Some people are just glad to have the new remasters on vinyl for the first time, while others are so disappointed that they are willing to return the record even though it's finally their chance to own this record for the first time on vinyl. Fortunately enough, I have the original HUT pressings and I can tell you they sound awesome. My suggestion for people that what to return their new remastered copy of the vinyl is to attach a note telling them manufacturer why you are returning the vinyl and that the sound quality is horrible. Hopefully, this will insure that if there is a second string of presses for this record in the future, they will take a lot more care for the sound quality of the press. I am very happy with the sound quality of the remastered CDs and hope that I can hear the excellent job they did on the CD on pressed wax. I know they can because the pressing that came out in the 90s were excellent. Also, I have the copies of remastered Gish and Siamese Dream and they sound awesome (I just ordered Pisces Iscariot but haven't had a chance to listen to since, again for the same reason I haven't had a chance to listen to MCIS on vinyl, I currently live in another country). It's a shame that they don't take the same care they use to when pressing vinyl these days. They really need to raise the quality standard when pressing vinyl or people are going to get fooled into thinking that vinyl sounds like garbage and CDs sound better. Both have their advantages and I actually love CDs for their clarity and definitely prefer them over MP3s, but nothing beats fresh vinyl when pressed right. I still prefer that vinyl over CDs any day.

B0017I1FP8|1.0|Remember when Batman and Robin came out, and people noticed that the score was the same as the Batman Forever. The exact same, I mean movie and the Musical cues didn't match. Now while that's not the case here, it's still the same score, Batman's theme if you can call it that. Actually I won't, because it doesn't have enough power to evoke the presence of Batman. Anyway, the same two notes over and over and over again, with the driving bass. Except now it's alittle louder, so you'll think it's different. The joker theme, oh wait there isn't one. Just a driving bass, and a modulation here and there on the notes. Quite honestly, I can sum all these zimmer Batman scores up right here and right now. They're monotonous, and boring. The same thing, no variation of what he's doing. No tweaking of what he did in the first score, it's the same thing just louder. No themes, Just that driving bass, and those two notes. Now I highly appreciate music, and while the music does underscore the movie, it's a greater testament to that score. When you're at home or in you're car, and you pop the cd in. And every track brings out the movie, These scores don't do that. Because every track is the same thing.
B0015DRPJU|5.0|I can't even begin to describe the conflicting and contradicting feelings this book brought to lonely nights with hot chocolate and fuzzy socks. The hungry desire that Rose and Dimitri shared was my most entrancing hook. I was waiting for two books now for my own personal satisfaction of seeing them together and now? It's so deliciously infuriating. I had hoped that the earlier book foreshadowing of Ms. Karp's lover chasing her down was a newly awakened Strigoi was not, indeed, for shadowing, but alas, we do not live in a perfect world.<br />I always find it fascinating, the fact that I need to read a truly good, gut wrenching book to break my own writer's block, but Mead has led me through some tough times. I thank her for that, for keeping me going in my own writings, and for being so brilliantly genius.<br />I had just turned to the last page and already I had my finger on a new purchase. I cannot wait to sink my teeth into book 4. Good luck with your journey little dhampirs and Moroi, and do not stop reading until the series has been drained.
B000002LIM|5.0|This is how you score a Batman movie. Danny Elfman walked the set of the movie just to get a feel for the movie before writing the score,<br />Track 1- The Batman Theme-<br /> This track alone is worth buying the cd for, It is the same cue that opened the movie, and it has a mystery about it, as well a darkness that it should, since it is Batman.<br />Track 2. Roof Fight<br />Not a very long track, but then again the scene itself wasn't that long either, this is the opening scene where Batman Catches the two thugs on the roof top, introducing Batman in a very Suburban legend way. Even the thugs talk about him as just being a figment of somebody's imagination. Another enjoyable track<br /><br />Track 3 First Confrontation<br /> This is the entire Axis Chemicals scene, Very dark. Atmospheric. what's nice, is that like the movie. Batman's theme isn't in it all the time, but when it is, you know it's there.<br /><br />Track 4 Kitchen, surgery, Face-Off<br /> this track picks up the date between Bruce and Vickie, and goes into The dark surgery room where a doctor is taking the bandages off Jack's face, the changes in the music are subtle, particularly when we get to the joker part, and it goes from soft and romantic to an undertone of crazy and alittle out there. We also get the Joker's theme for the first time as he shoots Grissom, which is a crazy waltz, very appropriate  theme for the joker.<br /><br />Track 5 flowers<br />This is where Bruce goes to the alley to lay flowers at the spot where his parents were killed, a very haunting track.<br /><br />track 6 Clown attack<br /> This is where Bob is taking pictures during the press conference, and using the joker's goons dressed as clowns to distract the people, also the very subtle build is nice here. You can literally hear the joker enter the picture and hear him kill the crime boss with his quill. It's tastefully evil and psychotic,<br /><br />Track 7 Batman to the rescue<br />Batman rescues Vickie from the joker inthe museum, and we get the Batman theme in all it's glory here. As Batman and Vicki speed off in the Batmobile, to Batman beating up the joker's goons in the alleyway. The track is driving all the way, my only small problem with this track, is that they didn't include the music of Batman coming through the skylight. But still, the track is awsome.<br /><br />Track 8 Roasted dude<br />lol, I have always said. Christopher Nolan missed it when it came to the joker. This scene alone sums up all and who the joker is, he kills a guy with a joy buzzer, only it electrocutes the guy. Turning him into a smoldering corpse, what the makes this scene more crazy. Is that after the Joker has cleared the room, he starts talking to the corpse. like an actual conversation, and the music here pucks up on that, it is crazy and dark all at once. A very bizarre musical track to underscore what's going on.<br /><br />Track 9 Photos/ beautiful dreamer<br /><br />this picks up where vickie is in her apartment, after the gangster has been killed, and she has photos of Bruce in the alley that she took, the track has a very tragic feel to it, as if she's trying to get inside Bruce's head, to figure out why he's doing what he's doing, then the track again shifts subtly to the joker in a similar state, only he's cutting out picture of dead people with smiles on their faces, we get a playful circus type of theme, and even when he see's vickie's picture. A soft romantic cue at the end.<br /><br />Track 10 Descent into mystery<br />just like the opening track, this track alone is worth buying the cd. You can't but put it in, skip it to this track, late at night while you're driving, and imagine you're driving the Batmobile. This is where Batman and vickie are heading for the batcave, this track captures all the darkness, and mystery of Batman. As they head or the batcave, we get a chorus group singing latin, with the Batman march played behind it. A very cool, and awsome track.<br /><br />Track 11The batcave<br />Again, very subtle music, mysterious too. As we are allowed into the batcave with vickie, the music doesn't try to override the scene, it underscores what is going on, as Batman explains to Vickie the Joker's plans.<br /><br />Track 12 The joker's poem<br />Another crazy score, as the joker has just shot bruce. And is leaving vickie's apartment, and as he does, he quotes this poem. the music has this soft, yet subtle dangerous feel to it. And we get a slight hint at the joker's theme here as well.<br /><br />Track 13 childhood remembered<br />A very emotional, and powerful track. As Bruce remembers who shot his parents, the music lets the scene do most of the work, it's a haunting track, as a matter of fact, Danny elfman takes the music from the alley scene, and expands it here. Adding to it, a very good track.<br /><br />Track 14 Love theme<br /><br />Vickie is standing in the Batcave, I would have fired Alfred but that's just me. We get a very soft romantic and tragic theme. As vickie asks Bruce why he's Batman, and if there will ever be a time where he won't.<br /><br />Track 15 charge of the Batmobile<br /><br />Yessssssssss, we get the suit up music. And then the Batmobile destroying Axis Chemicals, after listening to this track, it will make you want to go out fight crime. Danny Elfman opens it up alittle bit more here, not too much. But enough<br /><br />Track 16 Attack of the Batwing<br />Here is where Batman decides to go to the air against the joker, and grab his balloons before the gas kills everybody. A very good track.<br /><br />Track 17 up the cathedral<br />Here Danny Elfman goes for a very operatic feel, playing Batman's theme here and there leading us up the cathedral, it is very dark and mysterious and spooky.<br /><br />Track 18 Waltz to the death<br />For all it's glory, danny elfman gives us the Joker's theme. As he dances a waltz with Vickie, and Batman goes through a gauntlet of the last of the joker's goons, and it's very appropriate for this scene. It shows the craziness of the joker, even when it cuts to Batman fighting, we don't get his theme, just the joker's theme, the entire scene. Until Batman defeats the final goon.<br /><br />Track 19 The final Confronation<br />The score picks up with Batman and vickie hanging from the parapet, and it'd very operatic. With a hint of craziness, and danger all at once.<br />track 20 Finale<br />Here we get vickie and Batman falling from the tower and batman using his grappling gun to save them, the music conveys this feeling of chaos and panic, then all of a sudden it stops when they stop. And it goes into a soft melody.<br /><br />track 21 Batman theme reprise<br />Thsi picks up with the batsignal being turned on, and Batman standing on the parapet looking at the signal, and it goes into the Batman March.<br /><br />Final word, is this soundtrack is worth buying. It's good enough by itself, I would highly recommend it.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Obsessed with this! So glad to be able o purchase it on amazon! Great quality and super fast download! Five stars
B009HEJXFS|5.0|the movie may not have as many comedy as in the first and second one but the story can be very touching, im not going to spoil it but the movie tied it back to the first men in black and a great way to end the movie.<br />the acting was superb, action scene was great and the comedy was great, story wise it was very good.<br />my only gripe about this movie is that it does not have many aliens in it compared to the first one. If you are a fan of men in black then you must see this, to me it is actually better than the second one but that just me.<br />overall i love everything about this movie, its touching, its funny, and some good action. Villain not so great but every aspect of it makes it good.
B0002WZTOI|5.0|awesome collectors edition. comes with the case and a paper case over it. looks wonderful. my husband loved it. =)
B009IU6N5Y|4.0|Before I say anything else, I will say that I did enjoy this movie! It certainly wasn't a favorite or something that I plan to watch again, but I would tell anyone who was interested in seeing it to do so. The action was pretty over the top at points, but I believe that's what they were going for. If they wanted realistic the movie would have been a drag! The movie also jumped from scene to scene quite haphazardly, and to me, didn't flow as well as it could have. Really, those are my only two complaints.<br />The acting was well done, it wasn't too much gore, wasn't awful amounts of nudity (which the beginning will have you expecting), and it kept you on your toes wondering what would happen next. If you take the time to watch it I hope you don't take it too seriously and that you enjoy it!
B009IF8CH6|3.0|I am not sure what it is, yet, but it seems as if Big Bang Theory is missing its mark this season. There are laughs, but they seem fewer and further between.  I would like ot blame it on newer cast mambers, but I enjoy them all, so I cannot. There is something amiss in the chemistry of the show.
034580404X|5.0|Borrowed it, read it, had to have it!  A must have for all married women!  These books will change the way you think...
B005CKPQNE|5.0|I've watched Breaking Bad from the beginning to current at least twice now. Absolutely love this show! If drugs, violence, sex, etc. offend you - this show is NOT for you!
B0011UF79C|5.0|Words cannot describe how much I love this movie. I saw some of it in my Psychology class and it just caught my attention. It really is a well made movie and I cannot believe that I never heard of it before. It is well worth the money.
0735619670|5.0|I recommend this book to anybody who plans on programming for more than just a casual hobby. It's relevant information and it's easy to read.
B00A8ECU24|1.0|I am not interested in an app that requires you to buy your way through the different levels.  Kids could accidentally spend a lot of money by clicking on special games that are attached to the credit card on file.
B009FZHYKU|4.0|Even better than Season 2.  Surprises (which I truly like).  Fantastic show.  Endings always make you want to see the next episode.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Gonna have to buy more episodes<br />My family and I love this show it is a great show that we all love to watch.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Great Show, Great Season! Can't wait to see where it goes from here. Would definitely recommend this show to all my friends.
B000HKW7E0|5.0|This is a classic. You have to watch it at least once a year! I don't watch any of the other National Lampoon movies as much as this one. So happy to finally have my own copy so I don't have to wait or see commercials.
B009IU6N5Y|1.0|This was the worst abomination of a novel ever....the story line didn't even closely follow the book. The author must be horrified....I would not recomend this movie....
B001HBYHFA|5.0|I loved Firefly.  Between the fantastic characters and their onscreen chemistry, the background and plot, and the always fabulous Joss Whedon genius, this show is one that truly did not get the chance it deserved.  When it was cancelled, I was devistated and afraid I would never again get to enjoy a &#34;western in space.&#34;  But then this movie came out, and while I would have preferred more seasons of the show, Serenity provided me with more than adequate closure.  I can only hope that one day a miracle will occur, and we will either get a movie sequel or a revival of this incredible series.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|This season has been fantastic compared to last season, very engaging and surprising events, high character tension and above all, great zombie killing!
B009CPJHY4|5.0|Great story and great acting.<br /><br />I wonder if you have to be middle-aged or older to really appreciate it though?
B008FSCNTK|4.0|A bit of a different sound for Diana and I like it. I think hit it dead on. big fan of Diana's for a long time
B009369Z8A|5.0|This story is amazing and has a great cast. I love watching the story and the acting. It was well priced and shipped fast.
B009SMW9IW|5.0|Tracy in all of her glorious melancholy beauty. Not your typical holiday album but it's the one that I keep listening to over and over this holiday season. One of her best yet.
B0041B4B8G|5.0|I love this movie. I think its a corner stone of Will Ferrel's career. Every time I watch it I laugh.
B0064W652A|5.0|Been a huge fan of Batman for years. I know at only early 20s, thats not saying much, but I've been reading Batman comics and novels since I could get my hands on them. I went into this one not with much expectation but if I did, this would have blown them completely out of the water. This is just an amazing read for anyone who has been a fan of the Dark Knight and all his classic baddies.<br /><br />Highly, highly, recommend this to everyone.
B009G7ZYPY|5.0|Susan Boyle's newest CD is spectacular.  Her cover of Over the Rainbow is worth the price alone.  Her voice sounds even better than in her earlier CD's.  If you are a fan of music from movies and stage, this CD is a must-have!  Well done, Susan!
B009GEBBNQ|5.0|action packed from beginning to end, the scene with the hulk and loki are worth the price of admission alone.
B009HEJXFS|5.0|Funny and lots of great Sci-fi action. Josh Brolin is amazing as the young Tommy Lee Jones. Will Smith great as always. Awesome movie!
B005KELW26|2.0|I got my folio for my Kindle Fire last evening, and I question if this was truly made for this device. It says it is on the packaging, however the case doesn't fit the Kindle very well. It's about 1/2&#34; short on the width which causes the egde of the Kindle to be exposed, and the flap doesn't close properly. I don't really know what could be done to fix it, it's like it was just made too skinny for the device. Kind of a fail on power saving and protection of the device.
B000OCXI3K|5.0|Wonderful story of magic and romance overcoming dogmatism in rural France.  Not a whole lot better than the movie, but certainly as good as, and of course in some ways better.  I loved it, and I am sure I will read it again.  And, it makes me want to seek out the film again!
B008DYZKQE|5.0|Love this book!!!! I use to read it a lot when ideas little. Now my daughter reads it and she loves it too!!!
B009YP9L7U|4.0|I was hooked from the start. I enjoyed the story,and think the author delivered. The characters were believable and the dialogue great.
B003AO1SVS|5.0|This is my first introduction to The Black Keys, and now I want all of their music! I loved it from the first listen, and it just keeps getting better.
B003B02O7I|5.0|I enjoyed it from the start to finish.  Get's your attention right away, and has a good ending, unlike some of his novels.
0321544080|3.0|Impressive review of a master's work. I'm not quite to the point where it directly helps my photography, but it inspires me to progress.
1451695195|5.0|I decided to read Proof of Heaven after seeing Dr. Eben Alexander on TV this past year describing what happened to him during his coma. Like many other people, I have also had an NDE, so I was already a believer, BUT my husband remains very skeptical to this day. To others who are also skeptical: You owe it to yourself and anyone else you know to read this book and ponder the truth of what it says. Dr. Alexander is truly in the rare position of knowing that what he experienced was real and not some figment of his imagination or a fantasy. His explanation is credible, and I would encourage everyone to please read this book.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|It has a lot of twist and turns but an amazing ending. I recommend not one but all three of the books.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|its a simple little fun game.  It eill entertain you for hours.  The longer you play the harder it gets.
B003O86FMW|5.0|After reading the first book (The Hunger Games) I had to have more. Just like watching a tv show and anxiously having to wait for the next episode.I love the characters, amazing author.
B000TEUSJK|5.0|This DVD is really an interesting movie, I learned a whole lot about the Romans and Ceaser of the 15th centry, that I didn't know before<br />I am so happy that I bought this movie, it was suggested it to me, from a friend of a friend, so you see this is a great movie...
B002MQYOFW|5.0|It's an amazing book. I saw the movie and immediately got hooked. I wanted to read the book because its always different (more details) from the movie. It was worth it.
B00936A0RU|5.0|Don't want to give any plot points away so I'll just say wow. What an intersting supposedly true story of a family of bootleggers. Loved Hardy's character the most out of the three brothers. Shia's character for the majority of the film on the other hand was somewhat of a coward. Guy Pearce's role was fantastic I must say. He was one of those villains you love to hate and wait for his demise. And Jessica Chastain vava voom. Good job honey as usual. Gary Oldman should had had a more prominent role but I understand this is about this group of moonshiners not this particular gangster he executes very well. To those who are on the squeamish side of brutality on film I think you people in particular should stay away from this picture at all costs. But if you're into that sort of thing enjoy.
B006LSZECO|3.0|I got this book for my wife.  It is the type of book that she reads.  She thought that it was a good read.
B006GH6IS4|5.0|Loved this documentary on one of the greatest rock bands that ever lived. If you are or have ever been a fan of Queen I defintely recommend this title. You won't be disappointed.
B0083TXXZ4|1.0|This gun is horrible, it jams often and it barely shoots more than a few feet.  dont waste your money and trust me.  My child was disappointed and we had to return it back for a full refund
B008QE9VJI|4.0|I enjoyed this film even if this was not one of the classic burton/depp collaboration's. The set designs were awesome and the make-up effects were a good throwback to classic horror films.
B0042J6VUS|1.0|It was only three dollars, but they didn't say it would be broken when it arrived.. Better luck next time, I guess.
B009SQRL4U|5.0|Fun movie kinda answers kids questions.  Did not like the Idea of an uncaring Santa or Santa consumed with ambition greed.  I loved the rest of the movie.
B007PT3QOQ|2.0|love it but randomly closes right after I start playing. cant really like what you cant play. it does it for days too. not just once then close and reopen. going on day 3 now of trying to play.
B00A9C3RB8|1.0|This was the longest 1 hour and 40 minutes of a movie I ever sat through.  If you like predictable dialog and plot this is the movie for you.  Otherwise run.
0345803485|2.0|This book reads like a bad creative writing assignment written by an insecure, and slightly dull-witted high school girl.  It is simply one of the most wretchedly written books I have ever read.  (As the heroine would say, \\"Wow!  My inner goddess is yelling at me to put this book down!\\") The writing is so miserable, it's kind of a hoot.  I only give it two stars for its instructional value to would-be writers -- as an object lesson in how to write bad, bad prose.  Otherwise I would give it zero stars.<br /><br />It is also crushingly dull.  Apparently it is intended to be erotic, but don't expect any action in the first five chapters or so -- if you make it that far.  And I was expecting something salacious; what a disappointment.<br /><br />It occurred to me to wonder whether this book was actually intended as a satire.  (As the heroine would say, \\"Oh, my!  That would be...so...hot!\\")  But no, it seems to be in earnest: sadly, insipidly, and deadly in earnest.<br /><br />Dear God, I humbly pray, please return the time I wasted trying to read this inexplicably bestselling piece of dreck.<br /><br />Awful.
B009NW9QE2|3.0|This is a solid pick at the holidays for a feelgood romance flick.  It is totally predictable and not much substance - just a good no-brainer for date night.
B009K0P10K|5.0|Perfect combination of mystery, suspense, action!  Great story and cast... great show.  I just hope it lasts for many seasons!
B009CPES4I|4.0|This is a fun movie that intertwines the stories of several lives.  There are a lot of solid actors that deliver good performances.  It pulls you into their lives and you share some fun and sadness.  Worth renting.
0385535147|2.0|Sooner or later it had to happen.  There had to be a John Grisham book that I didn't like.  And, after a couple of dozen books, this is it.  And why...well, at the most basic level it's because of what Grisham himself says in his \\"author's note\\" at the end:  \\"This is indeed a work of fiction, and more so than usual.\\"  So that was strike one -- to me what set Grisham apart from all the other pop novelists - his fiction didn't seem so much like fiction.  Each story and almost every turn of events in each story seemed so real and believable.  Here, you really do have to suspend belief.<br /><br />But on a more specific level, it seems to me that Grisham here breaks one of the key rules of a really good book or a really good movie.  There's not a single \\"good\\" character too root for.  In fact, in reality, there's only one character in the book. It's all about the lawyer who becomes a con who becomes an ex-con.  None of the other characters are really developed beyond their mere utility in advancing the plot.  And so, the only character to root for is the only main character there is, and he's a crook, a swindler, a racketeer.<br /><br />So I was stuck with a book that isn't quite believable with no character to identify with.  At first, when you assume the main character is a victim, I liked the book...and for a while, even thought this might be one of Grisham's best.  But, as it began to become clear that the main character wasn't as much the victim as we thought, the book also veered off from where I thought it was going to...well, in a direction that was not in sight...not hinted at.  And while most of us don't want a book where the plot is obvious, we also don't want a book that makes us think over and over:  \\"What's going on?  I don't get it.\\"<br /><br />Okay, so I'm down on this book.  Does that mean you shouldn't read it?  No, not at all.  It's well written in terms of writing style.  Just don't expect to have any sympathy for any character in the book.  For me,if it had been a cheap paperback, I'd probably have tossed it.  But I hate just throwing away a hardback!
B0098VYKSA|3.0|This is probably a good film for those that like fantasy's like Harry Potter and Lord of the Rings.  However, it is not in that league.  I would rate it as a film to watch when you can't find anything else that catches your attention.
B007HACDLK|4.0|Good writing and some new characters that need to expanded on. Better than his last one. This actually ended to early. I would have liked him to continue the story line a little further, but I guess that's the next book. He needs to put Mitch somewhere else in the world for a change. Getting tired of Iraq and Afghanistan.
B000W9DSVW|3.0|I had high expectations for the Blu Ray version of this series, but this was a let down. A usual, the movies were great... Highly entertaining. But the big let down was the quality of the Blu Ray version. It didn't look any better than the DVD version. And then there was the grain. SO MUCH grain. Honestly, it was very disappointing. The only upside to this whole thing is that I bought when it was on sale during Cyber Monday.<br /><br />Bottom line is: Buy the series if it's on sale. If not, then opt for the regular, cheaper DVD version instead.
B00110K62U|5.0|A friend just loves &#34;Les Miserables&#34;  So Santa's giving her this DVD for Christmas. A great addition to her Musicals Collection. She'll love it!
B008UUPOVM|5.0|I rarely buy full albums anymore, but after hearing the cuts on this one, I had to have it.  He's grown since his &#34;Fireflies&#34; hit, now collaborating with other songwriters and singers (such as Carly Rae Jepsen).  The tracks are almost immediately catchy.  Good dance grooves or just for listening---works either way.

B0013TTLDE|5.0|The House at Riverton was a great read! It really grabbed me early on, and continued to hold my attention. Kate Morton has a nice flowing style, that manages to flip between eras and not lose the reader. I admit, I was able to predict most of twists and turns, but knowing ahead of time didn't take away from the experience of the story at all. Don't be daunted by the size of the book, it is worth the read!
B006O5Y0SS|5.0|you ...... will ........... love .......... this ..................item ............ without ......... a ........ doubt ......... I ......... promise ........ you
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Great book. I loved this sequel to Catching Fire. It is a must read, but of course you must read the other two first.  You wont be disappointed.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|I need sounds to fall asleep.  this app has the most authentic sounds and vast variety that this app is part of my night time routine.
B009NQKPUW|3.0|Biggest let down of the summer.  Fitting that it was written by a LOST scribe.  It had about the same feeling of disappointment at the end.  It is pretty to look at and there is some fine acting, but it left some gaping plot holes.  Actors acted out of character.  They were not the brightest bunch to select for a trillion dollar expedition to find our origins and immortal life.  Scott really missed the boat (or spaceship) on the film.  I'd rank it above Alien 3 and 4, but that isn't high praise.  I think he needs to step away from the Blade Runner project after seeing this film.  I know he wants to do a sequel to this prequel, but I'm not excited by the idea.
B000V63BN6|4.0|This is a remarkable mix of angry and upbeat songs from the legendary SW. If you can't afford to get the individual albums, then you need at least to get this one to round out any collection.
B001EC2ISA|3.0|I've enjoyed this movie ever since I was a young boy. It has Tim Burton written all over it as you might expect since he is the director, but it is very well acted (Geena Davis, Alec Baldwin, Winona Ryder).
B00913DPW2|4.0|This game is really fun but kept me stumped throughout the entire thing. You have to figure everything out on your own. No clues and no way to know what's correct or not.
B004ADH1RI|4.0|I've loved this movie ever since I was a young boy. Filled with the adventure most young kids daydream about.
B00899F0G8|5.0|I have loved this series from day one! The tv show is great and the books are suspenseful yet funny! They keep me wanting to read more!
B009LH1Y1W|5.0|need i say more.... 8 seasons and still going strong. I find each episode consistently funny, refreshing, and beyond entertaining!
B000SGGUWS|5.0|I have loved this series from day one! The tv show is great and the books are suspenseful yet funny! They keep me wanting to read more!
B0002F6BRE|4.0|I haven't tried the infinifilm stuff yet so that's why I did not give it 5 stars but just watching the movie was great and it is one of my favorites!
B0073LWEXK|5.0|pretty fun game kind of reminds me of the mist games for playstation. nice graphics and fun little puzzles easy game to help pass some time
B008NB0SQO|4.0|I loved this movie. It brought me back to my childhood as I rewatched it. The video quality is great, audio is wonderful, christmas spirit is amazing. Even though I never was a huge fan of the song &#34;When Love Is Gone&#34;, I did miss it in this edition. The song was simply cut. It made the film miss something.
B006RXQBJS|4.0|There is something about a slightly adjusted film that breathes some new life into it. However, this is also a movie I watch at least once a year, so it is on my top 100 films. Any good movie should be watched at minimum twice, as the second viewing will be a whole different experience.
B005RUUUAI|5.0|This is one of our all time favorites!!  From the acting, actors, set design, always changing storyline..... dont miss this!
B008D28HYS|5.0|I suggest you use a tablet for this game, and but it is still great fun on my phone.<br /><br />If you like logic puzzles, and get this app.
B005CKPQNE|4.0|We have loved Breaking Bad and the outstanding actors in this program.  This really is the wrap it up due to the program ending and let me tell you, go back and watch it from the beginning or you will never get a real sense of it.  Adult only content and fantastic hanging storyline.
B0087HT36U|5.0|I hate time wasters, but keep coming back to this one! It is addictive and fun. I would love to see some more levels and new ways to siege. I will likely replay this between Angry Birds installments.<br /><br />I would recommend this app to anyone who wants to destroy bridges instead of building them.
B005LLSNNE|5.0|This is an adult only fantastic drama, thriller program that is a must see.  We did not watch it for a while due to the gang element.  But, it takes you where you have never been before and it is a wild ride.
B004G6009K|5.0|Highly recommend this movie set that comes with 3D, Blue Ray, DVD, and digital for only $19.99.<br />You will love this movie, and the kids will watch it over and over, again.
B006VREHRS|5.0|Wish Amazon would have this available for $1.99 instead of $2.99 ohhh welll.  Steve Buscemi knocks it out of the park with an amazing season.  One of our top three all time favorites.  Set design is fantastic and makes you feel like you are walking around in the 1920's.  Thank you for having such wonderful programs available.
B003L77GGK|5.0|This show is amazing, and the box set got to me in perfect condition. I will definitely be buying the next seasons in the future as well.
B003D81NVQ|5.0|As far as the writing, actors, set and storyline.... it does not get any better than this.  Not for the faint of heart but the reality of what is done in the drug world.  Cheers to this wonderful crew, too making this all happen so we can take this wild ride.
0545265355|5.0|I love these books. The writing is unique and so are the twists and turns. I'm someone who has read a lot of fiction of every type, and relatively large amount of non-fiction. And whereas I can usually predict how parts of the storyline will turnout, I definitely did not see most of it coming. This was a very nice surprise, and I am now definitely a fan. Be slightly weary though, each book has parts that get more violent and gory than the last. I know that's to be expected of a book about a large group of what are basically children fighting to the death, but I thought it was worth mentioning.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Fantastic story, actors, settings.... You never know what will happen next and we just love that!  They go outside the box and bring it home for us all to be in awe.
B000NTPDSW|1.0|I did not order this item, nor did I receive it as a gift. I checked my account and found no record of it there. I have no idea how or why I should review it.
B007KOMTUI|5.0|If you want to start this program you must watch it from the very beginning to get the proper sense of whats going on and the dynamics of all involved.  This is one of our very favorite programs of all time and cant wait for season 6.  This was slow to come out but it was so worth the wait.  This reminds my husband of when he was a young teenager and the memories from the 1960's.  I think this has special meaning for the baby boomers since they lived through it but the young must realize what has happened in the corporate world and how far we have all come.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|This game is awesome. I love shooting rainbows out my ponies butts lol lol hahahaha cupcakes. I am a fat house cat nursing my sore blunt tongue. its twilight look it up
B0050PYNP8|5.0|A funny, funny movie.  The language is a little rough, but the story line has all those nods to other SciFi stories and movies.  I would recommend this funny movie to the over 16 crowd.
B009EA3JDM|5.0|... but you're going to love him anyway.<br /><br />I haven't seen the film, and I've been told you get a warmer view of Carson in it, but as far as his journal is concerned, you see a very self-absorbed and arrogant teenager, happily exploiting others through slut-shaming, threatening to out gay kids, etc. He makes fun of his best friend, Malorie, too, because she's a little unusual. That said, everyone he does bad things to have done bad things to him (other than Malorie, actually).<br />And most people can identify with his plight. He feels stuck somewhere where his dreams don't fit and he is doing everything he can think of to escape. He may not be a role model for how people should behave towards others, but when it comes to single-mindedly chasing ambition, a lot of us could learn something from the young Mr Phillips.<br />Having read this, I'm just dying to see the film when it is released.<br />The book is a serious accomplishment.
B00A9C3RB8|4.0|The blend of comedy with a current plausible message merged with good acting and good script a very enjoyable movie.
B000JQU1VS|5.0|I am very happy with this purchase. The stories make for quick bedtime reads. Very clever and entertaining material. Classic must read.
B004IFYMWK|5.0|Accurately written, perfectly produced, and brilliantly acted, Fair Game is no game -- it is the critically important and compelling historical account all Americans should learn.
B003G4W49C|5.0|I am so happy I recently learned of this book and the series. I hope the movie doesn't gloss over the complex issues in the book.
B0079R8KO0|4.0|Very happy with this case cover! I got my boyfriend the Kindle Fire and he loves this cover because it can stand up by itself! Very nice fabric. Good Buy!
B009IJJ5B4|5.0|This is a great series. From the scene where Watson (Lucy Liu) meets Holmes to the end of the episode, I was hooked. I had to buy the series so i wouldn't have to deal with the constant and lengthy commercials that plague all of TV these days. More mystery/suspense/police series like this one, PLEASE!! This is one of the greats ... and that damn-near guarantees that it won't make it to season two.
B001CW7ZXA|4.0|The DVD arrived extremely fast.  It was ordered for a gift, as the person indicated they always wanted this DVD.
B005EHILV4|1.0|I have several mic mix, but this one is the worst. The white noise is too loud that I cannot withstand. Even without a microphone, the noise is intolerable. I mean the noise could go up to 60 dB while put your headphone onto the headset slot. OMG
B007HACDLK|5.0|Another page turner from Vince Flynn.  He is by far my favorite author & I just can't wait for his next book!
B007EECSFA|5.0|Kate Morton has become one of my favorite authors.  The story is gripping and keeps the reader engrossed in the novel. I love the way she uses flashbacks to tell her stories.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|Good story tightly woven . Fast paced and believable . No mind bending surprises though. Just the question of how the protagonist would pull it off.
B0058PJ6NE|1.0|it closes me off this app after when I watch a video and some videos you cant play do not get this app its not worth it
B003CSV7TK|5.0|One of my favorite movies of all time, the awesome \\"Miracle on 34th Street\\". I love the cast of this version also. I've seen all the other versions, but this one, to me, is the best. In my family, this movie is a tradition for us now. I look forward to watching it each year. I recommend this film to all.
B001P3SA94|4.0|A well written screen script and excellent sound track. Good story line about black blues players, Chess recording studio, and the birth of rock and roll. A very fine cast. Nice history of how 'race' music went mainstream and, eventually became rock and roll. This is not an historically accurate portrayal but, it does posit some questions for the viewer, about Chess, blues, and numerous blues musicians (for exactness in historical fact check the library for researce material).<br />This DVD is for entertainment purposes, with loose association to fact.<br />If one wants an accurate, exact history look elsewhere. If you want a flavor for the era of Chess recording (at which I recorded ) in Chicago, and, entertainment this is the DVD to buy.<br />Muddy Waters, Howlin Wolf, Little Walter, Chuck Berry are well played. Jeffery Wright and Adrien Brody (Muddy Waters and Leonard Chess) are exceptionally well cast, as is Cedric The Entertainer (Willie Dixon.)<br />Romance between Leonard Chess and Etta James (Beyonce Knowles) is rather far off the mark, but, this is entertainment.<br />I was impressed by how well the actors 'mimed' singing and guitar chords, it would have fooled me if I did not play. The guitars and amplifiers are period correct.
B00AA7O22U|4.0|this movie is really good but the end fight was to short and jet li wasnt that much in the movie but it was fun to see it
B00338QENI|3.0|I need to say right off that my opinion is skewed because I was most interested in learning all I could about the medical/scientific aspects of Henrietta's amazing cells. In this I was disappointed; there was a good amount of information, but some of the basic things I wanted to know weren't there, such as how safe it is to use cancer cells for general research on humans and a more detailed discussion of why this one woman's cells performed this way -- or at least whatever has been done to try to find out why. I was also distracted and annoyed by the interspersing of so much information about Henrietta's family, who, except for the author's key contact, are a pretty sad bunch. It was just depressing to read about their lives, and this information had nothing whatever to do with her cells. The author, whom I admire for her long-term devotion to this story, injects herself into the story often, and this also distracted and annoyed me. I realize that many people may have liked the personal info and that it may have helped them relate to the cell story and keep reading. However, it didn't have that effect on me. I would like to see this story told as the medical/scientific triumph it is rather than mired in the family story, which, by the way, does not have any resolution in the book -- a sign that it wasn't that relevant in the first place.
B00828HWJE|3.0|the movie was ok van damme was barely in it it was good to see peter weller back on the screen
B003O86FMW|4.0|More so even than the first book. The twists and turns held my curiosity for hours.<br />And the cliff-hanger at the end has left me thirsting for more...even if I'm riddled with confusion.
B0076DELIG|5.0|It's always great to hook up with an old friend, and that's what Harry Bosch is.  An experienced cop, now in the cold case unit, except it turns out that this case is really hot.  A young, attractive Danish reporter is killed in a back alley during the post-Rodney King verdict riots in LA in 1992.  Harry drew the case then, but had no time to do a credible investigation before having to move on to the next riot-related casualty.  Now, twenty years later, he's back on it again, and this time, when he turns over some old stones, he gets vital pieces to the puzzle of her death.  He follows those pieces to a bloody showdown with the killer, and .... well, you gotta read it to learn how it all turns out!  As always, the characters are as important to the story as is the plot.  Harry's the lead, and his private life is just as complicated as his police life.  He's got a daughter who thinks she wants to be a cop, and a girl friend who thinks she wants to be more to Harry than Harry's ready for right now.  Add to that a boss who wants to rid his department of a guy he can't control, and Harry's got his hands full just trying to conduct an investigation.  This is another really good Harry Bosch novel; add it to your collection now!
B004J1DBJI|5.0|This application is very useful in my calculus class, as I can test things for my Mathematica labs on the go. If I need data or information, this acts as the ultimate powerhouse for that too. You can even compare the frequency of multiple names. It's overall just plain useful.
B008QTVNUI|5.0|Often hard to watch but compelling and you just keep wanting to see the next episode.  Mandy Patinkin is great, of course.
B00A7ZWUJC|5.0|I love it! I like the different styles of music on this album and I really like the song with her and Chris Brown called &#34;Ain't Nobody Business&#34; and I agree... it ain't.

1608871517|5.0|An absolutely fabulous book which I will treasure for many many years, and am glad to have as an addition to my Michael Jackson collection.  Full of wonderful photos of the garments, often with Michael gracing them with his presence.  The stories of how the costumes came into being are fantastic, and give yet another peak into the mind of the genius who was Michael, not to mention the minds and wherewithall of Michael Bush and Dennis Tompkins to bring Michael's ideas into being.  The sabaton boots I think are my favorite and something I knew nothing about before, and just highlight the amazing capabilities of all three of them.  I always love watching Michael performing, but now I know about the costumes, it is as if I am seeing it all again for the first time, and just loving it.  I recommend this book to just about everyone, from avid Michael fans, to people who are interested in new ideas and fashion, to people looking for stories of Michael that aren't sensationalist but show, yet again, the real man behind the 'silk mask'.  Well done 'Wardrobe' - the other Michael would be proud of this book.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|Really love this app &amp; it is very easy to use.  Lots of fun to mix the sounds to create what suits your mood.  Like the flute &amp; wind chimes for sleep.
B000WS4QJG|4.0|Glad to have this cd set and dvd to add to my now, sadly, complete collection.  Was a bit disappointed with the accompanying booklet which contained very little different from that issued with the special edition cd that I have already.  However, good to have the 3 classic short films of Billie Jean, Beat It and Thriller on one dvd for quick reference.  Good to have other artists singing with Michael or doing covers of the Thriller songs, but of course, no one is a patch on the Master himself!!!
B009HSPODE|2.0|As I recall the Author Alice Munro's work has won some awards and I haven't read any of her other work but I found this book of short stories rather morbid and depressing.
B007TK77QE|3.0|The book takes too long in describing dozens of characters and at the end it appears that there are too many descriptions and characters for not such an important story... The author, of course, writtes wonderfuly well, and for me, as a foreigner, it is a pleasure reading books so well written, but the story itself is, in my view, kind of weak, uninteresting.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|I loved watching the my little pony cartoon when I was little so as an adult Im having so much fun playing the game. I don't mind spending some actual money to get ahead in the game cause it makes it even more fun to play.I highly recommend you give it a try.
B0052RDHTM|5.0|One of the ebst book I've read recently. Ken Follet can be a little bit hard to read. Almost a thousand pages, and sometimes long descriptions. But in this book I think he redeemed himself. The story is interesting, the descriptions on a right rithim and lenght, and you learn a lot about the lauching of World War I, mainly in relation to aspects that you usually don't find in history books, but which are as true as the well known ones.
B002ZG999U|4.0|I saw The Expendables 2 in the theater and never saw Expendables 1.  I thought this was just a good as #2 - full of action and I really like the actors!
B0099114WO|4.0|Hope Springs(released Aug/12)is a tour de force character study/performance starring Meryl Streep as Kay Soames,Tommy Lee Jones as Arnold Soames,Steve Carell as Dr. Bernie Feld,Elisabeth Shue as Karen and others.Streep,Jones and Carell are the mainstays of this picture,which,as Mary Poppins would say,is practically perfect in every way.The film is definitely geared to an older demographic,so don't show this one to the kids as it does have some very adult themes in it.But children of the age group portrayed,might also see something in it either of themselves(as in maybe what's to come if...) or their relatives.<br />The story finds Streep and Jones as wife and husband,married for 31 years.Their marriage,to put it mildly,is in a funk.Jones has settled into his daily routine while Streep has come to the realization that she wants more of what the couple used to have,as far as their relationship and intimacy goes.Streep finds a book written by a therapist,who happens to also run a marriage clinic in a remote town in Maine(Carell).Streep of her own accord and without warning,pays for the $4,000 trip there,and hands Jones the tickets for the plane.He is adamantly opposed to it and vows to stay home.Come the morning of the flight Streep is off by herself to the airport and onto the plane.Just as it looks like she is really going solo,Jones appears and off they fly.<br />The town is quaint and rustic but Jones is constantly complaining of how much everything is costing.They have their first meeting with Carell who is super professional,patient and understanding.Jones however is not very cooperative at all.<br />The sessions go step by step,as the two try to overcome years of emotional and physical baggage.For every step forward,there seems to be one or two back.Jones is seemingly the bad guy up to a point,but we find out Streep also has alot to do with what has gone on in their marriage and relationship(it is a two way street after all).When the two get to,as the doctor describes it,\\"the one yard line\\",a disagreement/let down almost threatens to derail the entire process.They stay the course,but the two never successfully and completely turn things around,and they end up returning home with things,sadly,back almost to square one.Streep is ready to call the marriage quits,as she actually gets packed and ready to leave.That night Jones enters her room and closes the door behind him;totally out of character(yes,they sleep in separate bedrooms).The thought of Jones losing his wife finally melts away his stubborn pride and the two finally begin their long journey back to regaining what they had lost.<br />The film ends,and the credits roll,as Carell is presiding over the two's recommitting of their marriage vows on a beach(as per Streep's wishes).Very romantic.<br />Watching Streep and Jones playing an average married couple(their on screen chemistry was amazing,as was their underacting!),and who talk through the cause and effects their specific marital problems have had on them and their marriage,is an absolute delight.Also Carell plays the eternally calm and pleasant therapist on whose words hangs the balance of the Soames marriage,and I give high kudos to him for his wonderful portrayal.This is definitely a movie geared for the baby boomers out there and as such,in some big or small aspect,should touch a nerve with about every one of them.For a blooper,keep an eye on Jones when during the first session where he finally opens up about his sexuality,he does a couch scooching.In one shot he's at the far end of the couch the pair sit on,the next he is in the middle,then it's back to the end again.As a matter of fact the entire couch sitting routine is something else.Streep always,unless alone,sits on the right side.Through out the sessions,and depending on how well they are going,Jones goes from the opposite end,to the middle,back,all the way beside Streep,and then back to the end.This coupled with their body language are little things thatreally help put the film over.<br />Technically speaking the film is in its w/s a/r of 2:40:1 and is clear and crisp.Extras include commentary, a gag reel,a featurette and alternate takes.<br />All in all a wonderfully done look at the coming apart and restoring of a 31 years marriage gone wrong.It's like getting your own private therapy session,or being the bug on a wall at a real one.The threesome of Carell,Jones and Streep are simply outstanding.4-4 1/2 stars.really help put the film over.<br />Technically speaking the film is in its w/s a/r of 2:40:1 and is clear and crisp.Extras include commentary, a gag reel,a featurette and alternate takes.<br />All in all a wonderfully done look at the coming apart and restoring of a 31 years marriage gone wrong.It's like getting your own private therapy session,or being the bug on a wall at a real one.The threesome of Carell,Jones and Streep are simply outstanding.4-4 1/2 stars.

B009RI4ZKC|4.0|Quirky tale of coming of age... GREAT cast!! Very funny and enjoyable to watch a few of the actors step out of their usual element. Love anything Wes Anderson does.
B008Y2FRFO|3.0|I really like the game but running out of coins stinks!! I will not buy more coins so that's out of the question... I wish there was another way to get coins quicker. Other than that, the game is just ok.
B008ENNXQI|1.0|Not worth the time or the money. Actually couldn't watch till the end it was so bad... Good cast, but terrible.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|It is the most emotionally intense show on television. I wonder how long the audience can endure the emotional intensity of The Walking Dead. Great show, but I suggest pacing your consumption, because its currency is real human responses to continually difficult circumstances.  The cast and the writers of this television show continue to carry it to success. It takes the Zombie genre to another place. Most Zombie movies leave you asking yourself &#34;What would I do?,&#34; but The Walking Dead leaves you asking &#34;How would I feel?&#34;
0547884591|5.0|Capital \\"B\\" Better means meta-learning. Ferriss doesn't simply sell a gimmick, which would be the easy way out, he teaches a new way to be a better version of you. Fitter, happier, more productive is possible, quick, and easy. All the recipes/techniques are possible. Ingredients/materials are easy to locate. The process is a lot of fun.<br /><br />A little backstory: I was born disabled and require a wheelchair for my mobility. Everybody told me that diabetes and other lifestyle-related illnesses were all but a certainty for my future. After, narrowly, missing an opportunity to interview a journalist I trust (Clive Thompson) I saw that he vetted the Four Hour Body and Tim Ferriss. So I looked it up and it all seemed pretty unreal but my doctor had given me a dire warning that diabetes was on the horizon so I was ready to try anything. I'll admit that I didn't take a \\"before\\" picture because I didn't think it would work for me, having to spend my time in a wheelchair, but it absolutely worked. I lost 20 pounds in the first month. This was after a considerable inertial downward spiral of gaining five pounds a year since high school (where I was already fat). I'm still on the diet and still losing weight. Blown away, I remain one of the Ferriss 1,000 True Fans.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|One of Grisham's best.......different but engrossing. A nice change from his courtroom dramas, although I thoroughly enjoy those too.  Will recommend it to my friends
B00910Y1OQ|3.0|It was pretty easy to get through the levels the first time. As you start repeating the levels they add some &#34;unbreakable&#34; blocks that can be pretty frustrating. It's not bad.
B003EYVXUU|1.0|It pains me to see it once again: Hollywood plagiarizing original ideas and claiming them as their own. It's not hard to see why someone felt that this story could yield more money from the U.S. viewers - 'Let the Right One in', the Swedish film from which 'Let Me In' was blatantly copied from, was in fact a masterpiece in it's own right. To call this movie anything more than a facile, dumbed down imitation would be an insult to every great, original movie there exists.<br /><br />Aside from a couple of altered lines; some stripped scenes; a new, English speaking cast and an unnecessarily cheesy angel chorus score present all about the movie (to guide the poor viewer in his/her confused emotions), there were no real differencies. 'Let Me In' had some new CGI, which was outright needless to deliver the impact, as can be seen when comparing this to LTROI. The actors were worse here - an overload of that classic American mannerism we've seen a thousand times before, with little chemistry whatsoever. From the book, there were no new scenes which LTROI didn't have, which makes me suspect the creators of this movie did not even bother to read the book, but settled only to lazily copy the original film into another hollow remake.<br /><br />Some will moan about this being a whole different movie that shouldn't be contrasted next to it's inspirer, but that would be false. This IS 'Let the Right One In', made again in almost exact same style, with almost all scenes and lines exactly the same. Of course it is a magnificent story well implemented, but it is still a ripoff that should have never seen the daylight.<br /><br />I would not recommend this film, but instead 'Let the Right One In', the film 'Let Me In' tries so desperately to be. It has been done once, it needen't be done again.
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|Found this game to be more fun more addictive than angry birds! Fun for adults and third graders alike. Graphics are well done.
B007MDB71O|5.0|I personally loved this movie. I don't know why it didn't get better ratings. I like sci-fi movies and this one delivered.
0399157565|2.0|I am a fan of Patricia Cornwell and have all of her Kay Scarpetta novels. That said I did not think \\"The Bone Bed\\" is anywhere close to her previous novels. \\"Bone Bed\\" does not keep the readers interest and becomes confusing in the last few chapters. The ending is anti climatic, and in general poorly writen in my opinion. This book is very disapointing and I will read her future novels from the used book stores or library.
B002IFT1ZA|4.0|A friend of mine got me interested in this series. I don't get HBO so I ordered the dvd. I like it.
B0049P1N3K|5.0|When I read The Secret, I was changed dramatically by its lessons and words of wisdom and connection. I have already listened to The Power 5-cd set at least a dozen times. Each time through there is something else that stands out and you realize another valuable perspective. The Power holds something for everyone to gain from. The value in the simplicity of the lessons or \\"points of power\\" is limitless. I highly recommend this book, whether you get it on audio or text.

B000BW7QWW|5.0|I got this movie before I knew of the series. I loved the movie. Too bad the series didn't last.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|Excellent reading.  Let's the Americans know exactly what the servicemen go through for our Country.  They all should be commended.
B003R0MF5S|5.0|I loved this show and hated to see it go off the air. I will miss this show very much.
B002RHGYOA|5.0|I would recomend this book to everyone, it was a great follow up to the other book, love every moment.
B002JVWR4A|5.0|I am hooked on this show. I started watching reruns and couldn't get enough of the series. I had to add it to my small collection.
B007GCY8FS|3.0|I enjoyed the book Wanted Man but the thought of Tom Cruise playing Reacher took some enjoyment out of it since Reacher would  be better using simeone like The Rock or Van Diesel.  Someone that is not so small.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Another great sci-fi show that was taken off the air. I had to get my own copy and I loved watching it over and over.
B009NQKPUW|4.0|We liked this movie. It gave me the impression that this was how the original Alien was created. I'm talking about the movie with Sigorney Weaver.
B005LAJ22Q|5.0|I ordered this because I wanted a copy of the second season. I haven't watched it yet. If when I watch it there is a problem with the dvds Amazon will replace it.
B005LLSNNE|5.0|I am soo glad I got hooked on this show it is just so amazing and can't wait for season 6!!! Love it!!!
B008M721MS|2.0|blah blah blah. I have never used the appp but kindle is demanding a review!. I am only writing this so it can come off my screen.
B006YC74E8|3.0|I enjoy this camera, but I only can take pics in front of me, if I turn my Kindle Fire HD the other way around to take a picture of somehing else, I would not be able to see as I take the pic
B008HK3XU4|5.0|This case was a lot cheaper than the recommended Amazon case for the Kindle Fire.  It has a built in stand that I really like because I can prop the Fire on my lap and read it without having to hold it at the right angle.  It is also light weight, but substantial, so it does a good job at protecting the Kindle Fire.
B00A0R42L6|5.0|This is the craziest movie I have watched in a long time. Loved every bit of this movie. Love animated shows and this one is wonderful. It's crazy and yet it's got a great story line.
B00A6N7BS0|1.0|This movie is horrible, the performances of the seasoned stars could not bolster this movie up to a watchable state. Movie absolutely makes no sense, it's one of those BOSH, (bunch of stuff happens) movies, where the writers were asleep at the wheel.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I wasn't sure how the story was going to unfold, and I was actually worried for a little bit. But my gosh, this was a fun fun FUN story.<br /><br />If you enjoyed book 1, you'll enjoy book 2. Just fantastic!
B004I744AS|5.0|Thank you for this dictionary, it's the best yet. Just type in your word and everything you need about it comes up, no complications. Just what I have been waiting for.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I wasn't sure I would like this book. It seemed like a very dark concept... and it was. But I really REALLY enjoyed this book. I usually enjoy longer novels (Wheel of Time, Game of Thrones, Way of Kings etc...) but I really found this to be a fantastic story and I couldn't put it down. In fact it held my attention better than most book do.<br /><br />There were a few parts where I think the author could have given some more details, where I had to go back and read the paragraphs a few times (and sometimes still couldn't figure out exactly what was going on). Sometimes this was to dramatic effect, but sometimes I feel I just missed a piece of info. This is probably my fault, so maybe this isn't really useful.<br /><br />But that's a sorry excuse for a complaint. Really there isn't much to not like about this book. It's so very good.
B006R1T40I|5.0|Foremost, Ms. Raitt, and the voice...seven years is a long time to wait to hear something new. And then there is the gartar - some excellent sounds on this album. Her voice is deep and rich with age. This was an excellent choice.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I'm angry because the story is over. I was honestly sitting in bed at the end of this novel, and i was upset that it was done. It took me a good while to calm down over it.<br /><br />This was really well done. But if you read book 1 and book 2, well you don't need convincing to read book 3. Why are we even reviewing this :) ?<br /><br />It's hard to review without giving anything away. But I will say I enjoyed this story a lot. The overall ark of the 3 novels continues through this book, and the ending is interesting. I really wish they'd drawn the ending out more. I would have enjoyed a little more time on that... but it's hard to complain.<br /><br />Excellent book!
B005AKFXZW|5.0|A wonderful well crafted and interesting storyline.  A unique look at the world of circus through the fantasy genre.  Anyone who loves well written fantasy would love this book.  A gem.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|great game. found through resource books on apps. like the comic adventure. adds to the game experience which can be repetitive with most
B009YP9L7U|5.0|Such a great story, I really adored this romance! I adored it so.much so that I didn't put it down till I was done. I highly reccomend it!
B0060CXSR4|5.0|Nice video....I really wanted to purchase the DVD and bought this by accident....It is nice but I wanted the DVD....
B009WO7NQO|5.0|right now I'm screwed but the game is fun. IF I don't get both it will kill me.  I love at-at walkers.
B007EE4XKI|4.0|Exciting read - couple of dry spots when people are soliloquizing - just scanned over those parts and kept going - emphasis on excellent read though
B001KDQ4KQ|4.0|This author is always interesting, and here she digs a little deeper into her characters to come up with a more oomplex look at life.  The writing flows beautifully as ever and her insights are peppered throughout.  The story caught and held my attention, and this is why I continue to look forward to her next one.
B0078XFYDA|5.0|A very clear comparison of certain mysteries, myths and beliefs, to scientific reality.  An excellent book for teenagers and adults.
B00A0SQBDM|5.0|Just started playing this one, so far it has loaded and worked great on my kindle fire!  Will give another review later after playing the free version!
B001H4NXCK|5.0|funny and witty loved the way the tables kept turning on each one of them, the dynamics work well between all three of them
1476719071|5.0|I had the ebook of this story and loved it so much I wanted this edition for my hardback collections. The story is fast paced and interesting. At times it can be a little annoying as the characters seem immature but both main characters develop well throughout the book. Cannot wait for Walking Disaster to be out!!!
B002RXZF6C|5.0|I first saw \\"Frankenstein\\" in 1945.  Pretty scary stuff for my fragile little 7 yr. old psychy.  This DVD honors the original in every way.  The original slightly noisey, \\"overly bassy\\" audio and somewhat grainy film quality have been corrected and the original scenes are all intact; even the \\"little girl goes for a swim with the flowers\\" scene, which, by some PC standards of today, have been eliminated in some recent versions.  I'm not a reviewer type o' guy, but I think that a good word on this one is appropriate.
B00ACBN9CI|5.0|I am really enjoying this game. challenging enough to be fun but not frustrating. I almost got motion sickness! great flying shooter! madame says A+!
B008J34466|5.0|It took about two through listens for me to really vibe with this album. However, when it comes together it's a genuinely good piece of pop art. P!nk has a little bit of everything for everyone. Her ballads are touching, very emotional without going over the top. I feel that through the overall synthesized feel of the upbeat tracks, she can still kill these songs at a live show and they're so catchy I cant get them out of my head! On The Truth About Love, P!nk stayed true to her roots and I hope her music will always be written with as much angst, love and honesty. I don't love every track, but I hardly skip over the ones that aren't my cup of tea and I often catch myself singing along anyway. Yay P!nk, you did it again!
B00A72989U|5.0|AK's new album is her best ever. I can relate 2 each song...her voice is better than chocolate & smooth as velvet!
B000SEGUDE|5.0|This is a truly wonderful book. I have not seen the movie yet but I doubt they do it justice. The story is fascinating but the real value here is in the writing itself. Mitchell proves a virtuoso in his abilitiy to vary styles and modes of presentation. The reader is constantly surprized, entertained, and enlightened. Excellent!
B003AO1SVS|5.0|He loves it, I love it. Every song on the album is very good and some of them are divine. Modern classic.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|I loved it.  I can wait for more!  The movie made me feel like I was part of this time and the game.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this is a great game because it have so many other games in it like hockey and achery. the only bad part is  that .... there is no bad part. this is a game that I recommend to anyone that is on there tablet a lot and it works great on the kindle. everyone should buy this app and it's free.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|wish the pulzzes were longer. good way to wast time. fun as well. my kids enjoy it alot thank you
B00A8ECU24|4.0|pretty awesome, I like how you get to use all the aspects and characters. I reccomend it to any fans.
B00A7Z8KAU|4.0|Great app, have used it in the past on android tablets (and the PC version on my Desktop PC). The HUGE problem is, it is a great app, but only if you can get it for your android tablet. I don't like Google Play, won't use that service for apps, so please Amazon, get a version that can be downloaded for ASUS infinity tablets.
B001OGWY1W|1.0|I bought this movie because I was thinking of seeing the follow-on batman movie Dark Knight Rising. But after seeing the gratuitous violence in this one, I changed my mind about seeing the new movie.
B009JBZH54|5.0|I was going to get TDKR by itself since I already have the first two movies, but I'm a sucker for box sets and decided to get this since it was only five dollars extra. Not only does it come with all three movies, it has all the bonus features AND digital copies for each film. Exclusive to this box set is a booklet of art designs and on-set photos. The box itself isn't some cheapo piece of cardboard; it's very thick/sturdy and has a nice soft feel to it. I also like the new Bat-symbol artwork on the discs themselves.<br /><br />I can't believe how cheap they're selling this right now. I couldn't be happier with it.
0547884591|5.0|I purchased Timothy  Ferriss' lastest book after hearing him speak about it. I was wary of the length and my own cooking skills, but after spending an hour (not four hours) skimming it I was less intimidated and more excited to begin my own cooking adventures. As someone whose family rarely cooked growing up I have been seeking a way to start cooking without having to take an expensive class where I would inevitably know far less than everyone else. His book does a great job of breaking down not only the key components of creating a meal, but also the humble, no-nonsense writing style makes the entire book approachable as ever. Thanks Timothy Ferris for doing what you do best -- making complicated topics seem much  more friendly. After reading this book I yet again feel more healthy, wealthy, and wise.
034580404X|3.0|Yes, I read the entire trilogy in about 3 days.  I thought the author had a great sense of humor and can't help but feel that she wrote it with tongue in check.  Not for the 'pristine' crowd!  I've heard it described as &#34;printed pornography&#34; and, as I looked at it, interesting and humorous.  Too each his own.  I think the 30-40 generations are more opened minded.  Hey, check out some of the soap operas on daytime TV...the few I've seen, while channel surfing, certainly are risque'.
B007URVZJ6|5.0|came fast, helps me write an ebook, no problems<br />Great way to study new ideas<br />Good Job.  Keep on doing this
0545265355|3.0|I would call this a light read.  Just enough to keep the reader's interest.  I can understand the appeal for teens.  I was disappointed in the ending but then that is my humble opinion..
B009FZHYKU|5.0|If you're into anything zombie.. this show will absolutely blow you away. The storyline is very believable and I love that it is set in the south. It does not have the F word and very rarely has any obscene language. The only warning I have is that there is lots and lots of very graphic zombie killing. The special effects and makeup are the absolute best I have ever seen.  Two thumbs up.
B003MYYJD0|5.0|excellent product. was received at the indicated time and without any difficulty, as based on the place of purchase. recommended one product
B001JRB16U|3.0|The movie plays fine and the packaging looked right.  However, when I went to enter the \\"Magic Code\\" on the Disney Movie Rewards site the code failed.  This can sometimes be a sign of a fraudulent copy of a Disney movie.
B000SW2F80|1.0|Stephen King is in this show. He plays a retard, an appropriate metaphor considering he also wrote the screenplay. It's a comic book anthology of five relatively short stories that are supposed to be scary, or at-least spine-tingling creepy, but instead come across as just plain bad. Forget the horrible acting and laughable visual effects. The plots themselves; created by King at his hackiest, yes, but directed by the same George Romero who brought us the classic Night Of The Living Dead; are about as stupid as it gets. Attend this one at your own risk.<br /><br />marcellee.com
B009G7ZYPY|5.0|yes, it's about time Susan Boyle came back to her senses and recorded the \\" best \\"<br />cd of her career. She is meant to interpret the songs of the theatre, backed up by a symphony orchestra.  Her 2nd and 3rd cd's are a waste of time, but this new one is excellent.  Not a bad song in the cd.  Can't wait for album 5 if she stays on the right track. Thanks for listening,  JAS
B007SGLZP8|5.0|This book was awesome. Kept your interest from beginning to end with a few twists along the way! Great ending-ties everything together.
B008Z9YLV2|2.0|I wish I had never watched this.  It is made pretty well.  But this movie's representation of populous control, propaganda and general despotism is far far far too close to the current day reality to enjoy.  I guess I am not surprised that none of the other reviewers that I read seem to appreciate this, however, like this movie, I find it extremely disturbing... in the same way I am extremely disturbed that the majority are so easily manipulated into thinking that our government consists of a \\"two party system\\" and that we only have two choices to choose from.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|After reading some of the lower-starred reviews, I was a little hesitant to get this...I don't like having to buy things with real money to keep going. I tried this though after seeing how many high-starred reviews there are. I like I....it's a no-brainer, time passing game. And there is NO NEED to buy the coins...as long as you keep getting coins off, you gain them back...and when you Level -up, you also get more. By the time you run out of coins, it's time to do something else anyway! (when you come back...there are more coins to play with).
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I fell for the hype on these books.  I read them just to see what all the hype was bout and wasn't disappointed. They are well written, although at a lower grade level than I'm used to, and kept my interest throughout the series.
B0063IH60K|2.0|Pretty basic, not very challenging. Would not recommend to anyone who plays on a regular basis. Somewhat boring to me.
B0015AARJI|5.0|I read some reviews that they received a &#34;knockoff&#34; controller. I ordered mine direct from Amazon and can assure you that this is genuine Sony. If you choose to save a couple of dollars, and order from an unknown 3rd party then you run the risk of buying a sub standard product.
B006ZN7KMM|5.0|Muy satisfecha con el producto. Era lo que esperaba a la hora de comprar. Gracias por la atenci&oacute;n prestada. Es una lectura super interesante
B003UESJHY|5.0|Yes the language is a bit rough, but this is boxing and not croquet. If your a fan of the game, and Mickey Ward, this DVD is well worth a view. Also, I went on line after viewing this and purchased a DVD that included the fight between Mickey Ward and Arturo Gatti, a true classic.
B00028HBKM|5.0|When you watch this movie passion of THE CHRIST it makes you really feel more and more appreciation for THE LORD.This movie makes you love JESUS even more.To actually get a feeling of what THE SAVIOR went through for us to be here.Sometimes I don't think we was even worth it on how we go about life. We do not even show each other love,friendliness and not being devoted to church.This movie will turn around the most troublesome sinner. I am a true believer in GOD....and my LORD AND SAVIOR and i demand anyone who loves CHRIST get this movie.....AMEN
B007BVOEPI|5.0|this series has wowed me with how it tackles conveying the stories of the ensemble of characters the books offer up.  Kudos to HBO for another great series
B007HACDLK|5.0|Vince Flynn does it again! In typical Flynn fashion, the action starts immediately and never stops. As always, we hope our country has a  Mitch Rapp protecting us.
B00AE2J5HI|5.0|A little slow for the 1st hour, but all together an awesome movie. I would recommend this to anyone. Love!
B0015AARJI|3.0|from the moment i opened the boxes, i noticed a difference. With cheaper price, you get a cheaper product. They do work with my PS3 but for some reason, have a different dynamic with the programming. i bought 2 and both act the same. They are also not very strong. i dropped one from counter height and it cracked. i wouldn't reccommend this item to anyone unless you need a controll are are cheap.
B007SGLZP8|1.0|I was looking for a fun and easy read and decided to give this new John Grisham &#34;thriller&#34; a try based on the many rave reviews I read.<br /><br />Oh boy, was I disappointed. The characters are extremely one dimensional and the plot is just ho-hum. I never felt any sense of excitement and didn't really like the &#34;hero&#34;.<br /><br />Oh well, I still find Mr. Grisham very entertaining in person. If this book represents his best effort in a while, I guess I will listen to his interviews, but avoid his books.
B0090EKRKU|2.0|this movie was alright. Im not into musicals but there was no common sense with the character in this movie.
B004LWZWGK|5.0|While this movie may have some plotholes, looking at this film as a whole, Nolan has ended his take on the Batman legend on a high note.  This movie is not like its predecessor nor is it trying to be.  While one may like to see a comic book movie for the sake of the cool gadgets, the villians, fight scenes and explosions, all the action in this movie takes center stage when focusing on the lengths the character of Bruce Wayne would go to in protecting his city and seek his own happiness in the end.<br /><br />Though I enjoy The Dark Knight the most out of the series, I am glad to see closure for this trilogy.  You can sense the effort of everyone involved in this movie and enjoy yielding this masterpiece.
B004LWZWGK|5.0|Why do people complain about the \\"Oh...why cant they have other then UltraViolet\\" is beyond my thoughts....but for the movie's plot, characters, drama, action and mostly the climax.....this was an awesome movie..
B008ASLK8A|5.0|I will not go into a lengthy movie review, since I have learned that enjoyment of a movie can be a pretty diverse thing. Loved the first Sherlock Holmes, and knew I would love this one too. Didn't disappoint. Hoping for more sequels!
B00008PX8P|5.0|This is the thing!  Don't hold out for the Blu-ray, because it will not improve on the grainy quality of the old footage featured here.  In surround sound, this 2 DVD set captures the essence of a great rock group.  With over 5 hours of material that sounds great, Led Zeppelin shows how good they were in concert.  &#34;The Song Remains the Same&#34; showed the band when they were not at their best.
1878424319|5.0|This book, The Four Agreements, by Don Miguel Ruiz, is an easy and quick read yet, teaches a powerful message, that inspires people to change their lives if they agree to these four agreements. The four agreements are: be impeccable with your word, don't take anything personally, don't make assumptions and always do your best.<br />I enjoyed reading this book because Ruiz writing style is smooth, casual and straight forward. I personally have taken these four great agreements as advice for personal growth. I strongly suggest everyone to read this book because it can change them in a positive way, to interact better with others and be better to them selves.
B000VLE3IS|4.0|This is a great introduction for those who are unfamiliar with Led Zeppelin.  The CDs feature an acceptable selection.  The DVD strategically pares down 5+ hours of the \\"Led Zeppelin\\" DVD material to the ~2 hours offered here, though with useful captions to label songs.  This is not for long-time Zep fans, since you already have all the songs in your collection.  For the complete DVD material, stick with the \\"Led Zeppelin\\" release to get everything.
B009G41CG2|3.0|I have discovered mahjong thanks to Amazon Apps. I love to relax with as good simple mahjong game. This one is cool to the eyes. T also has a variety of mahjong tile set-ups. (I wonder how would I manage that, in the real game. It is a real game I think.) I would be willing to try it out, now that I've learned the rules.
B006HTUZ1C|4.0|Great game for kids or adults to sharpen their math skills.  The game is fst paced so it will make you think fast.
B0063GORYU|5.0|I love this app. It gives some reprieve to the hectic life most of us lead. I can play and watch television or idle away time while waiting for appointments.
B004V5A7K8|4.0|just a plain old fun game.  I lkie how different levels have more objects dropping.  You need to pay attention to this.
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|I am sorry that I finished the trilogy...I will miss Lisbeth!<br />Excellent reading.  Enjoyed all three books.  However,  the intrigue of the last book was sometimes overpowered with detail.
0425263908|5.0|Great book. Could not put it down.I have enjoyed reading all of Sylvia Day books.Canot wait till her next book is released.
B009VL28W2|5.0|Well I haven't seen it yet but that set-list looks pretty good. Nothing off of Load and Reload is enough for me to pick it up!
B009PMB3CI|5.0|I LOVE this app!It is soooooooo fun!u can pet your dog,give it toys and treats,give it a bath and more!Buy it!!!!!
B007UPNA6Y|4.0|This was my 1st  Jack Reacher novel and i thoroughly enjoyed every page. The story was exciting and well written. Will try other Lee Child books
0756404746|5.0|Let me start by saying there is a difference in a novel being enjoyable and a novel being good.  Enjoyable is subjective, good is not.  For example, I did not find the Song of Fire and Ice series enjoyable (to nihilistic for my tastes), however, I recognize that it is very good. I found the Magician series by Raymond Fiest to be highly enjoyable and entertaining although I know it is not the most well written series ever.<br /><br />This book/series is a rare case of being both extremely enjoyable and incredibly good.  The plot is engrossing, perfectly paced, and well thought out.  I love the main character.  Every time I pick up the book I slip into his shoes in under 10 seconds.  It is so easy to feel what he feels as you follow his story.  I find it incredibly refreshing that neither the problems nor the solutions to those problems require the characters to step outside of how they would rationally act in that situation.  I find this to be the failing of so many novels (song of fire and ice being one of them).<br /><br />As I read the 1 star reviews, I can not help but think these people have low self-esteem.  The common thread through most of these reviews is that the main character is to perfect.  They hate that he is smart, a great musician, and can do magic.  I personally enjoy reading about a great person overcoming the great problems the world presents.  I want my heroes to be heroic, to be something to aspire to myself.  I get that not everyone else does, the anti-hero is very trendy right now.<br /><br />The people who 1-star this series almost always hold up the song of fire and ice series as the opposite of the kingkiller chronicles, but don't listen to them.  Like I said above there is a difference between enjoyable and good.  The critics of this series are confusing not enjoyable with not good.  They did not like the book therefore they think that it is bad.  They want their anti-heroes in a world where everyone is bad guy and no good dead goes unpunished or the book sucks.<br /><br />It annoys me that these anti-hero books get the ironic label of being \\"more real\\" (its funny because they are fantasy novels).  I don't not believe the natural state of man to be wicked and have found karma to me more real than nihilism.<br /><br />Look, if don't care about quality and are just looking for a book where everyone is a bad guy who hate life and everyone living in it then you probably won't enjoy this series.  But don't call a book with a great plot, interesting characters, and well thought out themes bad.  Just say you didn't find it enjoyable.  That way we will understand that you simply have different tastes, and that you are not, in fact, stupid.<br /><br />After you read this series check out Brandon Sanderson's novels (Mistborn stuff and the amazing new Stormlight series).
B00979OL5A|1.0|deleted after I download. both my husband and I tried to get it to work, but we couldn't and it did not matter enough to contact anyone
B009IJJ5B4|4.0|I purchased this show because one, I love mysteries, two, I love Sherlock Holmes, and enjoy watching adaptions. I'm a big fan of Johnny Lee Miller, and have seen him in several films. However, the myseries are not that difficult to solve, and I can usually spot the guilty party and than only need to figure out the how. Still, considering that I watch very little primetime shows and don't own a TV, its worth it to me to see on my computer.
B000TXZVGQ|5.0|I loved this series and am thrilled to have a complete copy of it.  I just wish the show had not been canceled; it was an excellent show in so many ways, and there are very few of those out there.
B001QU0WGU|5.0|DVD CD COMBO TELLS THE STORY HOW THE BEST SELLING, SOUNDING AND RECORDED ALBUM IN JAZZ BEGAN ITS DECENT TO THE #1 JAZZ ALBUM IN HISTORY..
B0099G4Y26|5.0|Pink has matured but her music still fun, pop influenced with a rock edge. She just gets better and better.
B000003N7F|5.0|WITHOUT A DOUBT THIS IS ONE OF THE TEN BEST JAZZ ALBUMS OF ALL TIMES..  MAYBE ONE THE THE BEST FIVE IN MANY INNER JAZZ CIRCLES.. PERIOD...
B009JNQ86Y|5.0|My new favorite after wearing out Lights. Ellie Goulding is a major talent and her music is phenomenal. Best track is Only You. Every track is amazing though.

0345803507|3.0|I am embarrassed to admit I read all three even though I have never read erotic romance novels before. The second and third books were better than the first. I did find my self getting bored at the repetition and the predictable ending. Having said, that it was great fantasy and very entertaining! I have told my friends it should be classified as chick porn!
0547884591|5.0|Great book so far!! Made Osso Buko last night and it was fantastic!!! Tim Ferriss is a God!! MUST READ!!
B00A11AN6O|5.0|THIS IS A VERY CONVENIENT, INTUITIVE PRODUCT. IT IS ESPECIALLY HELPFUL FOR TRANSFERRING FILES TO KINDLE FIRE OR TO ANDROID PHONES.
B003G4W49C|4.0|This is a good sci-fi novel, and I can't wait to read the next one, and see the movie.  An interesting concept and well-written story makes this a recommened read.
B009WSNOU4|5.0|Eben Alexander narrates his book superbly. I prefer audio books and have listened to many and he is the best I have encountered. You can really feel his emotion in the read. I can imagine he was quite choked up at times trying to read this. The book itself is fantastic and a recommended read/listen for anyone.
B0070XFNDE|4.0|I feel in love with Carlos Ruiz Zafon's books starting with the Shadow of the Wind, and have read the over book in his Cemetery series.  I gave this one only 4 stars though because I felt it wasn't quite as good as the previous two.  Didn't have the same intrigue and mystery the other two had.  This is still a good read, especially if you have read the previous two books!
0425263916|5.0|I read the first book in this set called \\"Bared To You\\" in August. I wanted more so I ordered this one right then. (even though it wasn't out yet) I received this one as promised as soon as it was available! Sylvia Day is a wonderful author.
0553381407|4.0|I enjoyed reading this book very much, and became very emotionally affected by the terrible abuses some parents bestowed upon their own children. I picked this book initially to see how to deal with the abuses that my parents have put me though unknowingly, and by the time I finished reading the book, I am relieved that my parents were not that terrible.  Although I have to say that the confrontation is the hard bit, and when I came to do that I could not be very calm and neither were my parents.  Confrontation is necessary for reconciliation, though it was not easy when we both believe the other is wrong.  My first attempt did not work, and it took me a few tries later (and I believe it may need to be an on-going thing).  One day after my first attempt, while I was still angry with my parents, I felt a lot of love for them despite the hurts that I felt from them, and I come to see that from their perspective I was hurting them too.  I prayed to God to forgive the hurts that we caused each other due to our limitations, and to help us grow and learn to relate to each other better.  One month later, something drastically changed in my life and I learned the importance of acceptance.  As my parents came to my aid, I shared with them my understanding that they were not perfect as parents though they did the best they could, and my willingness to do the best to accept them and love them. Things has been a lot easier between me and my parents since, although at times we can still feel the compulsion to lash out at each other due to our limitations to accept. After that happens, I usually resort to praying for forgiveness and God's healings for all of us, and positive results followed. I enjoyed reading this book, and I hope I could shed some light on the matter with my own experience, however I do acknowledge that my parents's problems may not be as extreme as some of the worst cases in the book.<br /><br />Hope I can share with you a quote I got from another book by GarySmalley about relationships : \\"It is only natural that when something terrible happens to us, we become even more aware of and sensitive to the sufferings of those around us. Awareness and sensitivity then become the basis for genuine love - being able to detect another person's need and having the motivation to meet that need in the most effective way.\\" Sometimes suffering can be blessings in disguise, may Love heal us all.
B00992CF6W|4.0|It looks like a good game but I had some questions. How r u supposed to break stuff. All I've been able to hit is animals. How am I supposed to break any sand or dirt or wood. I rated it four stars cuz I bet it is really good I just am too stupid to figure it out. So please, if any body is reading this and they know how to play it really well,and has rated it 5 stars, then please write a review to answer my question. This might sound really dumb, but I really wanna play this game right. Thanks! Hope you'll answer me!
B007THA4FI|3.0|Although the premise is interesting, I found the British terms and entire piece a little difficult because it was mainly for an English audience.  Most of the time the books I read are generic in wording and easier to understand.  One needed a glossary or dictionary to get the complete immersion into the storyline.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This game is awesome, I love it, it takes brain power to figure out how to connect the dots without blocking yourself.
B009NPKTN6|3.0|I really liked the music in it and thought Tom Cruise did a really good job. Was surprised how well he could sing.
B000LXXNEG|5.0|Movie has always been a classic. Great casting of actors and actresses. Recieved it in great condition with no scratches or anything.
B009HEJXFS|5.0|From beginning to end, this movie is a great escape! All the characters stay true to the series... just a good time.
B006SMLAMQ|5.0|IT WORKED REALY GREAT WHEN I WAS IN CENTRAL AMERICAL AND HAD WIFI TO KEEP ME UP TODATE ON INCOMING STORMS.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|My 9 year old gave me his hard-earned 3 dollars so i would download this for him.  He spent the whole day playing and was really excited about it.  The characters are hilarious because the look like the star wars characters.  We have 4 different versions of angry birds,  but this one is the best so far.
B007HACDLK|4.0|Vince Flynn has given me another winner<br />His is always a page turner and fast read<br />my husband is reading it now and he loves it.
B009SIE6AA|5.0|I practically have all of James Taylor's music.  His voice is soothing and kind and touches my heart.  This is no exception.  I love listening to him sing.<br />I downloaded it to my kindle and it works great.<br />Now if i can only get James Taylor to sing to me ~ I would be i  heaven.
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|If you like stories about witches, vampires, and demons set in modern day society, then you'll probably like this book.
B0083GR6Y6|3.0|I like Liam Neeson in many movies, but I felt like this movie fails to produce a worthy ending.  It is entertaining, but I would recommend not spending 5 dollars on it when you can spend 1 at redbox.
B0014U4X3U|5.0|I just adore all of Jane Austen's books and characters. It is a nice way of &#34;seeing&#34; into the past worlds of these women. Very cool. :)
B00846F1YW|4.0|I loved the first Mysteryville and was thrilled when a second was available.  More than just a quick game, it was interesting, challenging and fun.  I was disappointed when Mysteryville 2 shut down (can't remember at whiich point) before I could complete the journey.  I tried several times and it shut down multiple times.  Disappointed but hoping it will be fixed...and that there will be many other versions.
B0055Q5F36|4.0|Great case for protecting my Galaxy S II. Just wish I had been able to get it in better colors. I ended up spray painting the hard cover and use it like that. Over a year and the phone looks like new when you take it out.
B001FVV2X2|5.0|I'm a brand-new fan of Fringe, so what can I say -- if you are a die-hard techno-sci-fi fan, this is a great series.  I can't wait to get caught up to the current season.
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|I really enjoyed this read.  I was looking for something different and certainly found it in this book; the story was touching without being cloying. The characters were well developed and believable. I recommend it!
B0073LWEXK|1.0|Installed just fine, but refused to run on my Nook Tablet running CM 10 (Android 4.1.)  Which is a shame...  it looks like a great game.  Hope somebody updates something soon.
B008FPOIT6|5.0|I bought this book from a referral by a friend on facebook.  I really liked the melding of new technology with old books and rituals in the story!  A very good mystery and read!
B009IQ1HBI|5.0|NO DOUBT,this has been my favorite CD for a while! I love her and this has to be the best CD Ellie Goulding has released to date!
B003H9M1Q2|5.0|This is a Christmas. present for a man that loves elephants. We are replacing VHS with DVD's.. I know that he will be very excited!
B009HV2JT8|2.0|Visually stunning as far as special effects. The movie as a whole lacked intrigue and a storyline....somewhat disappointed with it.
B007SGM084|5.0|I had only heard that this was a must read romance.  Then I bought it and could not put it down.  Unusual and not the sort of thing I normally read but after I got past the initial shock it was well worth my time.  Well written.  Would suggest it for a mature audience but not for the younger set including teens!
B009YX02T8|5.0|It seems the Twilight soundtracks are always better than the movies. I have yet to see Breaking Dawn part-2, great CD though.
B00136Q4P0|5.0|Gives a good variety of his music. For all ages and provides music from all ages of his career.  Fantastic
B0076DEJMO|5.0|I have read virtually all of this gentleman's work, and I must say this one was my favorite. The action is pretty much nonstop, and I enjoy the way his books are often extensions of previous works. I look forward to his next book.
B003QSOFFO|5.0|She has seen it at least 3 times already, but still likes to watch it all over again! A good Disney.
B009HEJXFS|5.0|This is by far the best MIB to date. It was funny and sad and well made. Usually the first of two or three is the best and the rest not even worth seeing; but, not with MIB-3. We will be watching it again because it was that good! Enjoy...
B003O86FMW|5.0|With the movie coming out soon I'm going to make an effort not to spoil it for anyone!!<br />The book starts with Katniss and Peeta being back in 12, and having to get ready for their Victory Tour (tour of all districts and the capitol the victor's do to promote the hunger games and keep spreading the &#34;fear&#34; around Panem).<br /><br />Long story short, Katniss's trick with the poison berries before the hunger games ended has made the Capitol very angry and the rest of the districts come together thinking it's time to uprise.<br />This year, it is the year of the 3rd quarter quell...celebrated every 25 years to remember the dark days when the districts rose in rebellion against the Capitol.<br />For each quarter quell, they come up with some new form of horror. In the first quarter quell, the citizens of each district had to vote which kids would be sent as tributes to the hunger games. On the second quarter quell, each district had to send double the tributes (two girls and two boys).<br />The 3rd quarter quell brings more nightmares than anyone could possibly imagines and develops in a demonic arena meant to torture the tributes.<br /><br />A really good read!
1451638450|5.0|For devoted readers of the Vorkosigan stories this is like dessert with whipped cream and a cherry on top.  Ivan, who has fled marital entanglements with great fervor, jumps into a choice one in a moment of chivalry and ends up a hero in spite of himself.  At last \\"Ivan, you idiot\\" takes center stage and proves he's not an idiot. This is a great companion book for \\"Civil Campaign,\\" since they both are witty and delightful while satisfying the reader no end.  My daughter and I each picked out our favorite funniest parts and only Bujold could have brought them off so beautifully.  Any fan of Barrayar will love this one. It's a hoot, complete with bad guys, a treasure hunt and some very real danger.  And you understand why people love Ivan.  It's got it all.
B009FZHYKU|4.0|If you haven't given up on the show by now then you'll be pleasantly surprised by what season three has to offer.
B007HACDLK|4.0|Flynn's best work to date. The dynamics of Washington interplay with the CIA was good.  The setting in the field was up to date.
B009GED3HS|4.0|The show still funny most of the time and the actors are still fantastic but it does have the feeling of being stretched out. I think it's time we finally meet the mother!
B009RI4ZKC|5.0|I'm a huge Wes Anderson fan, so I might bit a little biased here. This movie surprised me SO much, in the best way possible. All the big names you went to the movie for are really supporting characters... the kids are the base of this movie. Heartwarming and so freaking CUTE (in a dark independent sort of way, of course). This is now one of my favorites!
030759565X|5.0|First off, this is a great blog, and the cookbook is everything you love from the blog! My wife already made the apple cider caramels, and they were AWESOME!
B009VB9VKY|4.0|Channing Tatum is trying his hardest to prove he can carry a movie, pretty sure he can stop trying - the only reason this movie works is because of him. Lots of hot looking men can only take it so far, but Tatum's charisma and over all likeability saves the show. I read a lot of advanced press about this movie and was excited to see Riley Keough, as well as Alex Pettyfer... kinda underwhelmed by both of them. Keough was in the movie for a total of five minutes (seems like some of that part may have ended up on the cutting room floor) and Pettyfer is way more stiff than in his other efforts.<br /><br />The worst part? I wanted to knock this down a star just for the terrible acting by Cody Horn. This girl has less expression than Kristen Stewart on a good day! I get that the awkward, hard, girl next door thing is popular among directors these days... but come on, she was terrible and had zero chemistry with Tatum.<br /><br />It's a good movie, just not great.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book is amazing! The love that Peeta has for Katnessi is so cute. The excitement of not knowing what would happen.
B009VB7QQA|4.0|I wasn't expecting anything from this movie except for some good costuming, but quickly became a Benjamin Walker fan. It's a creative story, mixing history with myth. Engaging and fun with just enough gore.
B000ID3KU6|1.0|The amazing cast must have been desperate for work to be in this truly awful western. I made it only about 3/4s of the way through.  There are so many better movies out there.
B009KHBDUU|3.0|I can't dislike a movie with a handful of my favorite actors. Costuming was gorgeous, the story was fun and Johnny Depp plays weird like only he knows how to do.
0547884591|5.0|As a lifetime chef and collector of cookbooks, I was a little skeptical about the title.  Once Mr Ferriss had clarified that it was about learning ANYTHING, rather than how easy it is to become a chef, I liked it better.<br />I met Tim Ferriss here in Austin at the Paleo Summit in March when he was finishing this book, and was struck by how his mind works.  I suspect that, beyond his extra dollop of intelligence that his and the minds of many people in his generation are structurally different from us Boomer's brains.  Constant stimulation, video games and the Internet would, I imagine, create a more relationship oriented view of the world than an object oriented view.  About time!<br />Buy the book.  It is an easy (very easy) read, and fully worth the price as a cookbook.  But delve back into it frequently for his methods.  It will change more than how you cook.
B007HGPBRC|1.0|After hearing about this book from several colleagues, I decided to read it, and one of my colleagues lent me his copy. Had I read the \\"Book Description\\" provided here on Amazon, I would probably not have been so shocked and disgusted at the content. I would still have read the book, but I would have been a little more prepared for the author's total disdain and disrespect for any view other than his own.<br /><br />The \\"Book Description\\" states: \\"Hitchens adamantly and bravely refused the solace of religion, preferring to confront death with both eyes open.\\" It is appalling and disgusting that any writer, but particularly a writer who is presumably being paid to provide book summaries, would write this line. As the widow of a man who was diagnosed at 47 with stage 4, inoperable cancer, I cannot fathom anyone equating accepting the \\"solace\\" that their religious faith provides them with, as the book description indicates, burying their head in the sand! My husband knew quite well what he was facing, fought it as hard as his body would allow, and never flinched or in any way tried to hide from the horrible situation he was in. Yet he also drew great solace from his faith, and I know this because he shared that with our children and I a few hours before he died, just 6 weeks after his diagnosis. As he said, it was the solace and support from his family and his faith that helped him fight the hopeless battle to the very end.<br /><br />The book itself is filled with the same disrespectful attitude that those who face cancer -- and possibly death -- who do not approach it exactly as the author did are either delusional or ridiculously stupid.<br /><br />An appalling book, written by a man with a total lack of respect for anyone but himself.
B009D5VNLS|5.0|Not only are the graphics superb but the ability to have the expressions reflect the emotions is as good as any live action, probably better in some cases. The story is suitable for the youngest viewer and enjoyable for adults. Just a real treat !!
B0073LWEXK|5.0|Beautiful graphics and soundtrack, nice story, and the puzzles are great. Reminds me of Myst, but on a smaller scale.
B009NQKPUW|4.0|This film helped flesh out the Alien universe. Ridley Scott keeps the feel of the original film alive and provides a lot more story room for the future.
B0063M22QO|3.0|I didn't finish the book. He is my favorite author but I get the feeling he didn't write the book. The first half of the book just dragged on too long. I will continue to read whatever he writes. Disappointed on this one.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Rio is my favorite Angry Birds game! Love having to find all the hidden pineapples, bananas,  etc. Very challenging - hope you add more updates soon!!!!!
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|the game is so fun to play.but it takes a long time to download it at least took an hour.
B0015DWJX2|5.0|This is one of the best books I have read in a long time.  Funny and poignant, the characters come alive in this book. I had to make myself read it a little at a time, like enjoying expensive chocolate.  I savored each night that I got to read another portion of the book.  It ended all too soon, but I am sure I will reread it - soon!
B0047VSW30|4.0|The story of Hypatia, which is the subject of this film, is little-known, but oh-so-relevant for modern Western culture. Everyone should know of her story. While I have always been enthralled by Rachel Weisz beauty, bearing and style, this is not one of the best made film vehicles for her. It seems to hover on the edge of camp, unfortunately, and never rises to the gravitas that the story and characters demand.<br />Nonethless, it was not horrible or unwatchable, simply a mediocre film about a VERY important historical character and story. It echoes ominously in these times.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|This app tells me how much time I have for the various things I can do on my Kindle ( watching movies, reading book, listening to music, etc.  Much better than just the little battery icon.  Will also alert  me when to plug in and when it is done charging.
B009NY59UU|2.0|I had never heard of the actual historical event that this movie was based on until just a couple days ago, and I admit up-front that I watched this movie from a very particular point of reference. Recently, I happened to meet the sister of the actual pilot of Jolly Green 67, Capt. Peter H. Chapman II. She didn't tell me much of her brother's story, or of the entire rescue attempt, but what she told me made me curious, and I researched the incident and the role her brother played in it. I know that Hollywood condenses and changes stories to suit their intentions, but I felt that this movie strayed too far from the actual historic events - which, frankly, would have made a more gripping film than this one. I was very disappointed in the way that the Jolly Green crew's story was portrayed in the movie, so differently from the tragic historical reality. I thought the way the film portrayed the pilot, even in this fictionalized way, was terribly disrespectful to the memory of Capt. Chapman and his crew.<br /><br />This film is typical Hollywood fare, nothing more, nothing less. I would not recommend it for anyone wanting to know any actual history about the Vietnam War in general, or this incident in particular. And I would think that even if a person were looking for movies that depict the human aspect of the conflict, stories of bravery, or the horror of war, they could find a better example than this too-fictionalized telling of a truly heroic piece of history.
B0094BB4TW|4.0|I am still learning to navigate my Kindle but like that I can access Facebook  without toting my laptop around
B00000K3D4|2.0|I love the movie.  Watched it once and loaned the movie to a friend to watch and when she went to take the DVD out, it broke in the middle leaving it useless. She felt bad and bought me a new one. But makes me wonder how cheap the case was or even the DVD to have it break like that.
B0058W74UY|1.0|I could not get this to work but that could be my lack of knowledge. Keep being told to update my flash but when I try to it asks me for the version to download and I don't know which to pick.
B002MU4NL8|5.0|It's been years since I've seen this movie and Tim Allen's role parody of William Shatner still makes me laugh as this comedy making fun of the original Star Trek (Shatner and women) and The Next Generation (young helmsman) shows is enjoyable to say the least. While at the same time showing the good parts of science function fantasy and how fun of a genre it can be.
B0091REZMW|2.0|If you like the search and find hidden objects then you will like this app.  I found it to be a little too dark for me.  Will try to adjust brightness next time to see if that helps.
B001FB4W0W|5.0|This was a christmas present for my sister, who is true blood obsessed.... she loved it and Im happy to have scored major points for my gift
0316228532|5.0|Another good one from Rowling. Not Harry Potter, but an interesting change and she can curse like the rest of us. You go girl!
0545128285|5.0|I seem to buy all my christams presents from Amazon.com. This was another christmas present I bought for my sister and she loved the stories that went along with the harry potter series. Another great buy from Amazon.com
B004J4WKTW|5.0|Whimsical & oh so colorful; I want more! If this is made into a movie, they better not disappoint. Highly recommended for the dreamers.
B00A11AN6O|5.0|I got this so I wouldn't lose any pictures. And I haven't. So when I go outside and look towards the sky... there they are... All my pictures, safe and sound. Up there in the clouds..Sweet
B004J64QSI|5.0|First saw this on PBS and had to have it.  Amazon was the least expensive DVD's.  What makes Les Miserables so enjoyable is ithe singing has clearity and emotion.<br />Get it,,, you won't be sorry
B005K17RU0|5.0|I got this first and for free it's great. But didn't want the adds. So for a mere 99 cents you can go PLATNUM.. oooooh ya. I love them both. and have both on my phone and Kindle Fire. Alot of info on either... Get er done
B007VUCAVO|5.0|It's easy for everyone to use and understand and it just simply works. The screen showing how long you have left for each activity is very useful.
B0067R0APK|5.0|I got the free one and it had a deal that said remove the ads.. So I went to it and for a mere 99 Cents you get this app with no ads.. I love it. Has alot of information . I would recomend this to any/everyone. Great app
B007PFD90G|5.0|This book made me think and at times, laugh. It was educational, full of insight, and relevant.  Mr. Rushdie voiced many of my thoughts and allowed me to identify with his story.
B009FZFONO|5.0|Greatest show to hit primetime television since sliced bread was invented! Always been a huge fan of zombies and now I can get my fix weekly!
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I can understand why people would give some negative comments about this book. I was reading Bared to you and I can't help but think of FSOG. But halfway through Bared to you and I'm hooked!!! I am a hopeless romantic and I am giving this series a Five star rating!  Eva and Gideon has a love story that can't be compared to FSOG. The series is full of struggle and gut wrenching situations that I think Ana and Christian's issues (FSOG) were nothing to what these two went through. I like the writing style of the author and the steamy scenes do not disappoint. My heart was breaking when Gideon  had to sacrifice  his time with Eva at the end of this book but I'm glad Eva finally trusted herself and her man towards the end.  I hope the third book will give us more giddy than heart wrenching scenes than this book. But all in all, I am so happy to have purchased the two books and I already pre-ordered the third one! To all the FSOG fans - buy the series! You won't regret it! It will certainly give you an alternative to reading FSOG  over and over again!
030758836X|5.0|This is an amazing novel. This author has a way of setting the stage for endings which leave you wondering how you missed so many clues to the final truths revealed. Certainly one of the best psychological thrillers I've ever read. We are fortunate to have such a young writer with so much talent. She certainly could be our own P.D. James.
B000I9TY4G|5.0|Serenity as a final chapter in the Firefly tv series does its best to fulfill the need to put closure on the tv series. As with many well-written sci-fi series, there isn't enough interest to maintain high viewer ratings which are used to determine if a series gets support or cancellation. Though I definitely enjoyed the original series, Firefly, the final chapter of the series with characters being killed lacked some of the essence and direction of the initial series.<br />That said, it is still a good closure on the series, and offers a last opportunity to say good-bye to the characters of Firefly.
0307341550|5.0|This novel is very well-written and you never expect the twist it will take at the very end. A thoroughly enjoyable work which you can't put down.
0321543726|3.0|First, I feel I must apologize to Dr. B. Stroustrup for my opinion. I have other volumes of his that I like and find more useful than this current text.<br /><br />This is a text written and used for a university course in C++. However, in my opinion, it is not as well designed as other textbooks sets of his that I have in my library.<br /><br />As a tutorial on C++, I find it seriously lacking in both reference material and guidance. Perhaps, if I had no previous knowledge of programming and C++, I would just find the book cryptic.<br /><br />Cryptic is not a good thing for beginning students.<br /><br />Rather than introduce and explain error handling early in the text, Dr. Stroustrup has taken the easy road by creating a macro file to use instead of having the student learn about the libraries built-in to the C++ Standard. The apparent rational for this premise is to have the student focus on programming techniques, and not error handling and libraries.<br /><br />That is not necessarily a bad premise except the text doesn't include the detailed reference material to more deeply understand the examples utilized for the examples, and requires finding up-to-date C++11 Standard references which, unfortunately, are seriously lacking currently.<br /><br />This makes the text as a stand-alone learning tool to be lacking in quantity and quality of material: not a decent tutorial on C++11 for the experienced programmer seeking to upgrade skills and knowledge, or beginner.<br /><br />Dr. Stoustrup's previous books on C++, are actually better written and make very useful reference texts that you want to keep in your library.<br /><br />This current text is not one I will keep as a reference for future studying.<br /><br />Respectfully,<br /><br />MJR
0307341577|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this novel. While it deals with unsettling issues, the writing is intelligent and thoroughly believable. I'm looking forward to all of her future novels.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|I was impressed with how well the other kept my attention.  interesting how the author told a tale from the past tense perspective.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|This kept me involved. I loved it. I think a great read is a book that you do not want to put down.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|This is an incredible series.  I can't wait for season 3 to come out. Season 2's development of the characters both upstairs and downstairs is great.
B008LY9AWG|4.0|I enjoy Michael Connely anyway, but what fun this one was. I could picture the house, the kids, and the emotions. Good job!
B009IEXKXI|5.0|This is one of the best books I've read in a long time. I strongly recommend you trying the sample and if you arent chuckling by the end of the first few pages you need to get yourself checked.<br /><br />This is the perfect mix of strong science, sarcastic humor, and damn good characters. The story is paced well and never gets slow or dry. Out of the 40 or so books I've read this year this has to be my fav.<br /><br />Think apolo 13 mixed in with sarcastic humor that will have you laughing till you cry. Its a must read.
B009HEJXFS|1.0|no problem with my internet  but this movie kept dropping and reloading made it hard to watch second movie in two days that did this
B00622BF40|5.0|This is one of my all-time favorite feel-good movies. I have lost count of the number of times I have watched it. But it never fails to make me laugh, make me cry, and make my heart soar at the stunning final dance. It is fun and funky and incredibly romantic.
B00A6PD9I4|1.0|movie kept dropping and reloading which made it hard to watch i dont think it was my internet wont use amazon for movies if this keep up i have no problems with nexflix
B0034CNSFU|5.0|Excellent album, I really like the rock of Jimi Hendrix and the sound of his guitar with Fuzz effect. I like all songs from beginning to end, is one of best albums of all time.
B00A1XOPE8|5.0|Let me first state that I am a huge fan of Brandon Sanderson. I think I have read everything that he has written that is available in e-book format and a few I read before I was an e-book convert. He never ceases to amaze me with his ability to create unique worlds and magic systems which are unlike any other I have read, and I have read thousands of fantasy novels.<br /><br />Now unto this specific book. The concept of the soul which underpinned the plot was interesting. The relationship between the characters were well developed. A well written book as usual, if a little short. To me, the book really showed you how the little choices we make everyday makes us who we are and can, over time, cause fundamental change.<br /><br />Well worth reading.
B008J34466|4.0|Good album, I like the pop of P! nk, good songs and lyrics, is a good cd to give to my wife
B009K0P10K|5.0|I thought the first season of Revenge was full of revenge, but this season everyone seems to be in on the fun.  You get to learn about back stories and see how other people involved in Emily's plan got to where they are.  It truly a wonderful guilty pleasure!!
B008Z9L94O|2.0|As another review said, there is a TON of distortion on the Zero track. As I was listening through the album, several other songs had moments of distortion as well. I was playing the album on my AT-LP120, hooked to an Onkyo receiver with Polk speakers, so it wasn't some cheap-old turntable.<br /><br />Due to the sound quality issues, I'm returning my copy to Amazon. I can't justify the cost of the album when the sound quality is so bad. It is really disappointing because the box set is beautiful.
B0042RJWTM|4.0|The version done by Tom Sellick was the first one I saw.  I like it so much I thought I'd check out the original, especially since Marvin has always been one of my favorite actors.  It did not fail to please.
B001EN71CW|5.0|Great show, great cast, best stories since the original star wars, also better in blu-ray. Fox's biggest mistake ever was cancelling it. Joss Whedon rules.
B00A8ECU24|1.0|game is free,but if you want to start to play, you have to buy something at very<br />beginning, so I delete from my kindle right the way. it is too danger if you pass it<br />to kids, because they would buy and play, and you pay.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|It was great seeing all these super heroes together. The movie was non-stop action, but it had a story to it and not just thrown together. Joss Whedon is great at what he does and this movie was no exception. Great in Blu-ray and 3D Blu-ray.
B009G78EE2|5.0|Socially relevant and fun at the same time. Can't wait for more from these guys. They're independent from the major record labels too... gotta love that.
B0069JBKHI|5.0|We got this off of thinkgeek.com when our daughter was about 1 month old.  My husband works on Sunday nights and wanted an easy way to say goodnight to our daughter without having to do so in person.  We fell in love with this product.  When we went out of town, we were able to \\"spy\\" on the grandparents that took care of her to make sure that she was down for her nap/bedtime when we suggested.  This is a total gem for when you leave your child with a sitter and expect them to follow your sleep schedule guidelines.  We are able to sooth our daughter if we are unavailable (as in my husband's case on Sunday nights).<br /><br />My love for this product was before a situation happened, but I love the company even more now.  We were cleaning our daughter's room when the power supply cord was accidentally broken out of the socket.  We were devastated because no other power supply we had came in handy and we had been without the product for a few months when I decided to email their support with the situation, I told them that we would not mind paying for a replacement part.  The customer service representative asked me for my shipping address and let me know the company would be sending one out immediately.  We were so shocked at how fast of a response and the fact that the company would send it free of charge.  Great job, Withings!
B000084T18|5.0|Since everybody knows how big this album was and how much drama that surrounded it, I'll give a brief review of the album,<br /><br />On \\"Intro\\" there is no rapping or talking, all we hear is a coin drop, following that we go into the next track produced by Rob \\"Reef\\" Tewlow, \\"What Up Gangsta\\" and the beat is sick especially when it first comes on, The good doctor gave fif a hit with \\"In da Club\\", you couldn't go anywhere without hearing the song or somebody just rapping the lyrics \\"Go shorty, it's your birthday/ We gonna party like it's your birthday!\\" The other singles were \\"21 Questions\\" (featuring Nate Dogg), its one of those would you be down for if I didn't have this type of song. \\"Many Men (Wish Death)\\" is the best song on here. On \\"Back Down\\", he also throws more shots on \\"Heat\\" the Dr. Dre's beat is simple, it has a constant guncok sound. Em shows up twice, on \\"Patiently Waiting\\" where he easily outshines Curtis and \\"Don't Push Me\\", also featuring Lloyd Banks. On the latter Em is rapping about the same stuff as 50 but he doesn't get called out for it? Double standard? But on another note it was a dope track. There are some missteps on here though \\"Blood Hound\\" (featuring Young Buck) was just too boring for me, the pimping anthem \\"P.I.M.P.\\" cant even be saved by his catchy hook. His braggadocios raps brings the down the album as well, at least switch it up sometimes! We know you got 9 times, we know you went from noting to something tell us something we don't know. As for the bonus tracks \\"Wanksta\\" took him to another level, it appeared on the G-Unit mixtape then the 8Mile sdtk, \\"U Not Like Me\\" and \\"Life's on the Line\\" were out before he was even signed. Overall I think 50 dropped a classic album and lets not try to rewrite history, this was biggest album of 2003. If you do buy it I suggest getting a used one for 5 dollars or less. I heard all 50s album and trust me this is the one worth checking out besides Power Of The Dollar.d because I will be re-writing a review for this album very soon. Its definitely a classic, so be on the lookout for my updated review.*
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|This game is amazing. desent graphics but great gameplay. game loft did a good job please make more games like this&iexcl;!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!&iexcl;
B008DL466C|3.0|I was gonna do a long review but its no reason to, he says the same thing on every single song. All he talks about is how much money he has, how many people stealing his style and haters Its like hearing the same song a million times in a row, now there are the some enjoyable cuts that's the reason Im giving it 3 stars. The songs I liked were Paperbond, Let It Go, The Bluff, Work Hard, Play Hard, Time, No Limit, The Plan and Medicated, but they aren't even great they are just listenable. Remember you is cool but Wiz ruined for rapping about stuff that had absolutely noting to do with the song, its supposed to be about a girl but all he does is spot braggadocios lyrics. Wiz said that this album was gonna be like Kush & Orange Juice, which is a classic mixtape by the way but this is nothing like that. Too much filler on this album, if your subject matter is that limited its no way you should have a 17 track album. No need to waste your money on this, diehard Wiz fans might love it but that's about it. Artist brags all the time so that's not a issue but when you don't switch it up sometimes people is not gonna wanna listen to it. Its no replay value and I cannot see myself listening to this album in full again. I'll stick to his earlier work for now. Hopefully he gets back on his grind and release something better next time around.
B002JVWQSW|5.0|It's a great price and arrived fast. First season was super funny. The cast is perfect and incredibly talented woohoo!
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|This book had me from page one! Even though it does have vivid acts of child abuse they are a reminder that they should NEVER be forgotten. One of the most heartwarming books I have ever read. I can not recommend this book highly enough.
B003L77G06|5.0|Great season, really funny, and the price was perfect. Wonderful comedy and would suggest people to get it for sure!
B003O86FMW|4.0|I couldn't put the book down. I love how she writes. She splashes word into insightfull imagery. I loved it!
B007PT3QOQ|1.0|this game WAS fun,  got up to level 66, update on Nov.  20th causes game to crash constantly,  can no longer play. developer has known of issue since Nov. 20 &amp; still  no fix as of Dec. 5th,  no customer support!  massive frustration for the User.  TONS OF BUGS!  do not bother with this game, ends in frustration. on kindle fire.
B0027MJU00|5.0|I purchased this book because I had read &#34;gone girl&#34; by Gyllian Flynn. Both books were good. I will order the first one too.
B00633W614|5.0|Really enjoyed it!  I was so disappointed when I tried to buy the third book to find it is not available until May '13.  Hope I don't forget the characters, etc....
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I don't have cable I use a stream service this is the first series that I have just had To buy so that I could see it immediately. They have done a really good job with the characters and although its not for the squeamish the focus is a very entertaining series of relationship dramas.
B004IDG97S|3.0|This movie covers a lot of ground in the Dredd mythos:  Mega City One, The Cursed Earth, The Angel Gang (!), The Long Walk, The Dredd/Rico relationship;  20 years of mythology in a 90 minute movie.  Stallone's catchphrase never works, but Rob Schneider does bring badly needed comedy relief.  I like it better than a lot of either people, because it's a big, dumb, comic movie.  Still beats Superman IV or Batman and Robin anyday...
B003ZSJ212|5.0|it took mr. lucas long enough. but well worth the wait! its like watching Star Wars for the first time! Star Wars has never looked better!
0061564893|5.0|I bought this book from Amazon intrigued by its title, it is a heavy volume, difficult to carry but I forgot its heaviness and kept reading and reading it for many days because, each page brought fabulous information.<br />I developed great admiration for the chinese rulers that already,in those years, had maps that showed  remote lands that the europeans ignored of. Their huge vessels were visiting those lands and some of their crew remained in those places.<br />The chinese knew very well that there was no danger of falling out of the earth as it was the common knowledge in Spain.<br />Columbus was able to sail to the west knowing what the chinese had done. He even got maps from them, his \\"discovery\\" had already taken place before he got there.<br /><br />Fascinating work that changes the history we have been told.
B003F3PMYI|5.0|A must read for anyone who wants to improve her/his work life and personal life.  The Happiness Advantage helps redefine what each of us must do to change/enhance our lives!
B009K0P10K|3.0|Not as good as Season 1.  Season 1 had Emily laser-focused.  Season 2 so far, I'm not appreciating as much.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Great book lots of twist and turns once you start it you can't put it down.Highly recomended for book clubs
1405882689|2.0|Thank You, but I received the wrong edition. I needed Penguine series book for child school reading. I don´t know what to do! To Send it back, or talk to a teacher.
B007SGLZP8|3.0|Having just read Litigators, I was expecting a little more out of this book. Grisham is a good writer, but the story was too predictable.
141970642X|5.0|Love the product. Its always nice to find a good price when needed in hard times. Thank you and have a great holiday.
B000OVLINI|4.0|I randomly chose this book while doing some on-line browsing of my local library resources. I had never heard of the title or author; I only briefly read the reviews, and chose this book on a whim. I was surprised when in the opening scene, the main character randomly chooses a book as well. Interesting...<br />Well, I thoroughly enjoyed this book. The characters are all well written, and felt real to me. The storyline is multi-layered, as there are stories-within-a-story-within-a-story. The plot is well constructed, and although there are many characters, the author does a very good job at tying in all the people, and all the story elements together cleanly. In fact, I found amazingly small details carefully tied together quite gracefully.<br />The book reads like what could be a dramatic series. Part \\"Thorn Birds\\", part \\"Phantom of the Opera\\", part \\"Romeo and Juliet\\", with shades of Dickens, and a sinister villain to rival many an evil character. While somewhat predictable, there were a couple of plot twists that caught me by surprise. In the end, the book left me pleasantly satisfied.
1419705849|5.0|Love the product. Its always nice to find a good price when needed in hard times. Thank you and have a great holiday.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|I love Grisham's books and this one did not disappoint me. Good story. Recommend it to anyone.One of his better books.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This is a lovely app that has a nice feel. A calculator is something we all need, and this fits the bill. It looks clean and professional on the Kindle Fire HD
B006ZZANG0|5.0|When I heard the title of the disc, I was worried that Rufus might be checking out. But what I discovered was a great set of new songs, including a few I can't get out of my head -- like Jericho and the title song, Out of the Game. Wonderful!
B004DLPXAO|2.0|I don't know why screen for reading is not white how it suppose to be. I can read but screen is awfully dark - darker than my Kindle reader. Please can somebody tell me if I can adjust brightness on this Kindle app on my ipad ?  All other screens for games or internet are nicely white - why the same does not apply for Android Kindle app? I removed Kindle for Android app and reinstalled it but pages are still very dark and not white.
0307346617|4.0|World War Z is good.  I'm almost done reading it and it has kept my attention to the very end.  Its writen in the style of a journalist interviewing people all over the world before, during, and at various times after the zombie event, or \\"Great Panic\\" started.  Extremely realistic.  I can see the events in my mind.  Good book.
B000001ESJ|5.0|Great CD, recommended for hard core, die hard Rush fans.  As a musician, I can always appreciate the arrangments and chord progressions as well as drum parts.  Top notch musicianship!
B00AA7O6QC|4.0|This was a surprise, total fun and better then the 1st one. Watched it with my 14 year old we both had a great time.
B003ODIZL6|5.0|You can learn many words and enrich your vocabulary...<br />I recommend this book to everyone.<br />Thanks for this book, bye
B003O86FMW|5.0|I really enjoyed this story from beginning to end. I read books 1-3 and couldn't put them down. It's night a lighthearted read, but I enjoyed it. The author really made me care about the characters especially Peeta.
B008Y2FRFO|2.0|Yet for some reason I keep playing. Don't get sucked into buying more &#34;coins&#34; though. It's unnecessary unless you feel the need to drop coins 24/7
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I can't understand how some people don't like this book. I mean it wrapped up the story so well. Sure it is dark for a large portion of it, but the story is about war. It ends as positively as it can. I loved this series and I especially was fond of Peeta!
B004LWZWGK|2.0|Ultraviolet is the worst idea in marketing ever, in thinly disguised promises of allowing access to your movies all the time. Sadly, without an actual internet connection, this is not the case, and after 2014, the switch gets turned off and that's gone too. Best news? Handbrake can rip a beautiful copy for you easily and allow you to use it where you want. If these movie companies want to show they care, they will release products in all formats, not just these locked down ones. iTunes has restrictions, but at least I can watch a movie when and where I want. Didn't buy the last Harry Potter films for the same reason.
0446572764|4.0|Child 44 is a fictionalized account of Andrei Chikatilo and the attempts to investigate and capture him.  The protagonist is Leo Demidov a detective for the MGB, the State Security force.  At the start of the novel he is the idyllic agent; a beliver in the cause, a hero in the Great Patriotic War, has a beautiful wife and a bright future.  All of this starts to change with the arrest of an innocent Veterinarian.<br /><br />Child 44 does many things right.  After the first 50-60 pages it picks up and becomes a very lively experience (I read the remaining 2/3 of the book in a single day.)  Leo Demidov is a well written and engaging character.  Mr. Tom Rob Smith does an excellent job of making the reader empathize with Leo as his world falls apart. The setting is very well done and one gets a good feel for what life in Stalinist Russia may have been like.<br /><br />I do not like several of Mr. Smith's narrative techniques.  One repeated problem I had was the use of a dash followed by italics to denote what I can assume is spoken dialog.  This is complicated by use of short 3-6 word clauses in italics without a dash to signify what I assumed was a thought that encompassed a main theme in that section of the book.  I dont like an author that is so condescending to the reader to point out the theme of a section least the unwashed masses miss the point of their book. The resolution almost ruined the book, it was bizarre and, despite the grim tone used throughout the tome, way too happy, almost Disney movie happy.<br /><br />I would recommend this book.  It starts off slow, so slow that I almost stopped reading it,but thankfully it does pick up and become very thrilling.  I found the complete ruin of Mr. Demidovs life and mental outlook very chilling and well written.
B008K6HN8I|4.0|I have it on my Samsung Galaxy S3, and my Kindle.  I can finally D/L files and can easily copy and paste them where I want.<br /><br />The only reason it is not a five star, is I wish once I pasted the files I did not have to go back and copy them again.  I often need<br />to paste the same files in multiple folders.  (ex. MAME)<br /><br />Overall excellent product with very little earning curve.
B008LV8TSU|5.0|This is a really well done fantasy / page turner, but way too long.  Nonetheless, I will still probably use this in one of my Fantasy Lit. classes in the future.
B0041KVW2K|4.0|Now we can go on for hours, arguing over the use of the 2009 digital masters on an analog format, but that's not the point. The fact is: if you knew that you were buying digitally re-mastered vinyl, then you shouldn't be complaining about it!<br /><br />I'd like to start off with saying, although a few imperfections, the overall quality of the box set is superb! Everything looks stunning right down to the last detail.<br /><br />The Good:<br /><br />Starting with the 252-page book, this alone is almost worth the $300 price tag... You can clearly see they spent a lot of time/effort working on the finely detailed artwork and writing. Every single page of this book is just so amazing... you'll have to see for yourself!<br /><br />Now on to the records... There are so many details recreating all the original artwork. This fine detail is also used on the gate folds, labels, inserts, posters, booklets and even the original ad on the back for \\"Emitex Record Cleaner\\". Although some have pointed out a few printing mistakes, like on track listings and such, these things are common.  Even the originals had a mistake or two, which ended up making them more rare and valuable! All and all, I think everything was made with high quality product, even the record sleeves are properly made with poly-lined paper.<br /><br />One thing I love the most is that they recreated the record labels to look like the originals. \\"Please Please Me\\" has the early gold Parlophone label, similar to the first few original pressings of the album. \\"Magical Mystery Tour\\", originally only released in the US (As an LP), had its matching Capitol rainbow label. Then the rest of the albums have either the original yellow Parlophone or Apple records labels. It's fine details like this that make the box set worth so much more.<br /><br />Although the set appears expensive, it really isn't. Do the math, fourteen albums (two of them are doubles) priced individually at say $20-30 each (which is quite fair for a brand new Vinyl LP today), works out to be around $280-420. You may find a better deal buying individually, but you are more likely to end up paying extra for each album. Not to mention the CD's alone sell for around $200, making this set much worth the extra $100.<br /><br />The Bad:<br /><br />Now lots of people have been complaining about sound quality, something that can be arguable. Now, personally I find the overall audio quality great. There is, however a few problems that I have noticed.<br /><br />Upon listening, most of the albums have a low level hissing noise that can be heard on quiet parts of the song.  Some albums louder than others, but that's normal. You cannot expect dead silence from every single record made, and most of it depends on your setup too. If you have a high quality setup and your treble/high frequencies are maxed out on the EQ, then of course you will hear every little imperfection in the album...<br /><br />Regarding the actual sound quality:<br /><br />Like I have mentioned, the overall quality is great. I do however, have some imperfections in my Abbey Road album that need to be dealt with...<br /><br />In the beginning of track A1 \\"Come Together\\" it sounds as if there is a scratch, but upon visual inspection, nothing can be seen. This \\"clicking\\" sound repeats every revolution of the record throughout the first half of the song, it is quiet, but definitely noticeable. Then the rest of the A side plays through with this weird distorted vibration coming from the left channel. This \\"fuzzy\\" vibration can be heard at least 4-6 times each song and is prominently loud over the rest of music. The last imperfection I found was a scratch; it can be seen quite visible on track B3 \\"Sun King\\". Fortunately not that deep, but it still can be heard \\"clicking\\" on the quiet parts of the song.<br /><br />So far, most of the other albums seem to be almost perfect, which is a good sign. I don't mind the one record having issues, as long as I can get it replaced.<br /><br />Shipping:<br /><br />This is a side note, as it is unrelated to the quality of the box set itself. I am not very impressed with Amazon's shipping... Many people claim that their box sets have come in a separate cardboard box, properly packed with Styrofoam, mine did not. When my box set arrived there was absolute no packing, it was just the box set itself! The shipping information was stuck directly on the shrink wrap of the box set; everyone could see what the package was... Also, since it wasn't properly packed, the shrink wrap was slightly torn open and the corners of the box were slightly dented/worn.<br /><br />Conclusion:<br /><br />Overall a great box set; clearly presented by all the effort in the small details. I would definitely give it 5/5 if I could get my Abbey Road replaced.
B007MB5OCE|5.0|A delightful book. The author tells a story to show how a positive attitude and a little luck can lead to a long life of adventure, riches, vodka, and castration. Not sure how that last part worked its way in the book, but it's there. Read it and you'll have a rollicking good time for a few days!
B008DVJO8C|4.0|This is a good album with some awesome songs. There were some songs that I did not care for, but the album overall is above average. The songs that stand out the most are &#34;Blood&#34; and &#34;Whore&#34; they are both epic and put the album ahead of the curb.
B000Q9IR0A|4.0|This book was recommended to me by a good friend and so far I am thoroughly impressed! I would put this on everyone's must read list at some point, especially if you are in sales.
B0076L9W9Q|5.0|A great album from a very talented band. Every song is above average and catchy. I think 20 years from now when the bands that are new today have become classic this album will be one to stand out.
B007HACDLK|4.0|The story was very good and relevant.  All the favorite characters are back.  It seemed shorter than previous books and I would have liked more scenes with Mitch Rapp working in country.  Still a good read and love this character.  Please Vince, if you sell the movie writes don't let Tom Cruise play Mitch Rapp!
B009K45Y62|1.0|$350.00 I don't think so you you have got to be the biggest jerk to to put that kind of price for something that just came out this week.
B0071XO8RA|4.0|It's a good dystopian story, The concept is solid, the characters are generally believable (I always knew IT was evil). The structure - five separate books - is questionable, but if you read the Omnibus, it works. The hero(ine) is very good.<br /><br />I took off one star because there are some events and sequences that are simply unbelievable, where it's clear that author either doesn't know what he's talking about or doesn't care, hoping the tension will carry him through. Also, there are some issues with technology that, surprisingly, aren't claified, such as how radio transmission propagate. (I don't want to spoil anythhing.<br /><br />It's a good read if you can handle these things. It's also a springboard for other Silo stories.
B00787IR2Q|4.0|I watched this with my 10-year-old and with both enjoyed it. It was good, clean humor. The special effects were well done. The video quality was good.
B00A6N7BS0|3.0|Not the greatest movie I have ever seen, but entertaining enough for an evening at home...<br /><br />Seeing it once is enough - not one I'd add to my library.
B0076DELIG|4.0|A little hard to get into sometimes...seems to wander.  Overall the story line is good and the characters are great.

B0067LXQAW|5.0|Arrived within days and very satisfied with this product. I recommend this to any fan of The Cranberries or Alternative in gerneral.
0316776963|4.0|David Sedaris knows how to spin his yarns into a tapestry of pragmatic realism embellished with colorful threads of exaggeration and humor. His word images evoke spontaneous laughter - from tiny titters to gargantuan guffaws. My only objection was the chapter involving his drug use. However, in his defense, that chapter was almost necessary to understand allusions in other of his stories. Yes, I confess, I have become a Sedaris junkie.
B000068VHS|5.0|No complants about this product love it and arrived within the time period I was promised, any Cranberries fan would love this.
B0063GORYU|2.0|I like a game that is challenging, that I can eventually win at.  This isn't it.  2 suit on any other incarnation I pull a 75% win ratio.  After 40 games on this, I have won 3.  I think I'll go to my dentist instead.
B0052RDHTM|4.0|I love Ken Follett's writing style, he brings the time period to life.  However, Pillars of the Earth and A World Without End is hard to top which is why I gave 4 stars instead of 5.
0316228532|1.0|I finished the book. I didn't want to, but I finished it. All 512 pages of it. I was disappointed, to say the least. I didn't find a single character that I cared anything about. I won't provide a spoiler, because I don't feel it's necessary. I have to say that this is definitely a character driven book. And there were so many characters all interacting and all having a point of view at the same time that I never did know who was telling the story. The head hopping left me dizzy. There wasn't any real plot. J K Rowling is indeed a masterful writer, but her style in this book left me high and dry. It is very dark, but that was all right because I knew that going in. The English phrases and expressions may leave a lot of readers confused, but the writing is authentic. I read all of the Harry Potter books and thoroughly enjoyed them, so I am a fan of Rowling's. Just not of this particular book.
B007SNMYNS|5.0|I truly believe that Dr D has hit the nail on the head.  There are too many 'experts' invested in the healthy grain school, who will fight this disclosure tooth and nail.  Glycemic index and low carb theories have been around for a long time, but wheat seemed to be getting a free ride.  Many naturopaths have been timidly pointing their fingers at wheat.  Maybe this will give them more conviction in their stance.  Bullying wheat has been sacrelidge for far too long.
B0050R0XPA|5.0|Great set.  Lots of pieces.  Fun to assemble and looks good as a Christmas decoration.  I'll probably pick up the rest of the Winter Village collection.
B003O86FMW|5.0|As I tore through the second book of the trilogy, I couldn't believe that I was even reading this.  Loved the first two.  Haven't read anything else by S Collins, but would be willing to give it a try.

B0069UP2PI|5.0|I am very happy with getting the movie on time!!! I really enjoy watching this movie that is why wanted this!!!
B0076DCT2G|3.0|Not one of the best.  Slow read and much like The Lion.  It did give you a view of Yemen and Al Quaida.

B0011Z32KI|4.0|Buble is cool and smooth. The more you listen the more you appreciate his talent. I would recommend to anyone.
B007P6VLRS|2.0|It tears me up to say this, but Billy has in my eyes totally undone all the good work he did in the 90's in albums like Siamese Dream, Pisces Iscariot, Mellon Collie and Adore. This band was the soundtrack to my life when I discovered them in my late teens. Their music was powerful, poetic, sad, and sympathetic, creating warm energies of love and devotion whilst maintaining a marvellous technical edge that few bands could execute. With Corgan's detuned guitars and Jimmy's dynamic drumming ranging from calm taps to fierce pounding and hi-hats, this band had an edge over many others.<br /><br />In the 2000's when the Pumpkins split Corgan really went on a trail of self-destruction. Unfortunately his depression has been allowed to poison about everything he touches including his former band members who he has openly trashed (Zwan anyone?). Corgan talks a good game, about the modern music industry, and how it pales in comparison with the past. Unfortunately, whilst there are still many artists making great music today, Corgan continues to produce worse than his bands and genres he berates from the safety of Internet and radio interviews.<br /><br />It's not that Oceania is a bad record - it's a terribly bad Corgan record like the last few of his releases. The music is OK, but too stationary and unadventurous. The opening track has some impressive pacing and timing changes, but for the remainder of the album you only hear filler. The lyrics are the worst in Corgan's career yet; \\"I'm going to love you 101%\\", and \\"I am Special K\\" being lyrics enough for this reviewer to choke. Knowing Corgan as much as I do, his \\"holier than thou\\" persona that he portrays casts a negative light over the whole record. Corgan could produce something earth-shattering and brilliant, except he's made something middle-of-the-road yet again. Corgan really need to find peace and spend less time worrying about what other bands are doing and produce something where others will stand up and take notice.ce.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|Vintage Grisham...a good beach read. Another trip into the mind of the incarcerated.  Twisty plot with enough detail to keep it real.
B005LAJ212|5.0|This series is very very good, I was recommended to watch it I do not regret to spend time on it, I am looking forward to watch the second series
B00AE2J5HI|5.0|Excellent movie.  Kept my attention throughout the entire show. That's the way to tell a story, its a shame it had to end.
0345803485|3.0|Okay for a quick read but boring most of the time. Maybe it was written for the younger generation to enjoy!
B007SSDS24|3.0|The movie was a good movie for a couple of beers and a warm blanket for a evening with noting to do.
B0095R76EW|4.0|Another great Judd Apatow comedy which is amusing but also poignant, heartwarming and real! I'm not into situation comedies but i thoroughly enjoyed this one.
B007MNV5WU|5.0|App is great.  My children like it a lot.  Just as fun as the original Angry Birds.  So far no glitches or problems with the game.
1423140605|5.0|This is another wonderful book by Rick Riordan.  I hope he continues to write them.  I have read every one of his books.  I can't get enough!
B001EAWMGA|4.0|In year 709 AD in Norway, in the kingdom of Herot (in fact hardly more than a village) during the reign of wise old king Hrothgar (John Hurt), a spaceship crashes. The pilot of the ship, a humanoid alien named Kainan (Jim Caviezel), survives - but so does a monstrous stowaway, an intelligent but extremely dangerous (and voracious) creature known to the aliens as a Moorwen. The Moorwen becomes fast the scourge of the kingdom and Kainan, after being caught by the Vikings, will have to help them in the hunt for the monster - something he is very eager to do, as there is bad blood between them...<br /><br />That sounds like a scenario for a very stupid and cheap \\"straight to DVD\\" monster movie, but director Howard McCain, who also wrote the story, managed to make of it a surprisingly good and original film. He also received a 47 million USD budget and he handled it very well. Viking's village looks very credible, costumes and weapons were carefully made and Moorwen creature is really SCARY.<br /><br />Although this is a SF film, the story was clearly inspired by \\"Beowulf\\". The name of king Hrothgar and the name of the country (Herot) both come from the poem. Also, exactly as in the poem King Hrothgar owns a large mead hall and at one moment a \\"magic\\" sword will appear. Moorwen is a voracious predator feasting on flesh of heroes, exactly as Grendel and Kainan is an outlander, coming from a distant realm, exactly as was Beowulf in the poem.<br /><br />Dialogs are surprisingly good for a B-movie and actors did very well, including Ron Pearlman who plays Gunnar, the brutish king of neigbouring realm (in fact just another village). Sophia Myles who plays Freya, king Hrothgar's daughter (and of course Kainan's love interest) did also a good job as a cute damsel in just enough distress to attract a mate, but not enough to anger the feminists...))) A good thing in this film is also that some other Vikings (mostly Wulfric and Boromir) have also something to do and to say during the film - it is not the \\"standard issue\\" B-movie in which the hero does everything and everybody else does just figuration.<br /><br />One element which I think was unnecessary was the presence in the village of a Christian priest (extremely unlikely in year 709) and his parodic presentation. This Christian bashing was the one thing that I really disliked in this film. On another hand, the ending was pretty good.<br /><br />Also, unlike in most of this kind of films, towards the middle of the film we have an insight in the monsters's side of the story - and at that moment I started to feel some real pity for the Moorwen, even if clearly there was no peace possible between humans and him...<br /><br />So bottom line, this is a very orignal, very interesting and pretty well made SF B-movie. I liked it and I keep my DVD to watch it again one day. Enjoy!the film - it is not the \\"standard issue\\" B-movie in which the hero does everything and everybody else does just figuration.<br /><br />One element which I think was unnecessary was the presence in the village of a Christian priest (extremely unlikely in year 709) and his parodic presentation.

B0063B2BNE|5.0|I can't stop watching this show! I want every single episode and all seasons! I love it! Everyone should watch this
B008NEMN0K|5.0|Will will will you to pay the bill for the reel of the movie so you can chill and feel real! Those robots are crazy!
B007V2UGPE|2.0|it takes 5 hours to download and it said it was downloaded and when i went to play it it had to re download! :(
0312430000|5.0|Super easy to read.  Dead Simple concepts.  All set within the dramatic, literally do-or-die setting of a surgery room (and the medical world at large).<br /><br />If you didn't think a checklist was a big deal before, you'll be a believer by the end of this book.  He details a breath-taking surgery room situation (where he literally plunged his fist into a patient's open chest to pump his heart by hand).  He even goes beyond surgery into other areas, outlining a death-defying plane crash (Jan 15, 2009 - US Airways Flight 1549 that crashed into Hudson River) that was saved largely by a few checklists.<br /><br />Maybe you aren't in those kinds of life-or-death industries.  I'm not either.  But I gained a way new perspective on checklists, and have started using them more myself.  For example, you'll learn about the difference between a \\"Do-Confirm\\" checklist, and a \\"Read-Do\\" checklist.<br /><br />Personally I had a tough time in the past figuring out HOW to efficiently, practically implement checklists in my own life (business and personal).  They were good in some situations (quick, easy to use, effective), but a real pain in the butt in other situations.... so slow and cumbersome that I quit using the checklist altogether.<br /><br />Author Atul Gawande sheds light on this exact experience, and offers insights on how to overcoe those obstacles.  These sections of the book were of tremendous help to me.  He's shed light on a problem I had and helped me realize where my checklists were falling short (and what to do to fix them).  Much appreciated.<br /><br />If you have a tough time with attention to detail, this book can help.  On the other hand, if you're a thorough, detail-oriented person (like me) you'll gain more ease knowing that you've covered everything in a particular procedure.  You can wrap up a task knowing you covered all your bases, because your checklist confirms you \\"got it right\\".<br /><br />Lastly, an easy read.  Gawande is a great writer, with a wonderful writing style.  I read the whole book over just a few days because it was so engaging and easy to read.<br /><br />Way to go Dr. Gawande!<br /><br />Tim :)
B007BVOEPI|5.0|Well, I'm hooked!  I absolutely love this show!!  There's sex, nudity, and full frontal male nudity - so if you don't like that sort of thing you might have to look away here and there.  Still worth watching!!<br /><br />The only down side is that HBO believes online streaming is a &#34;fad.&#34;  (Direct quote.  It's true - google it) Season 3 will be starting in March, and season 2 still isn't available for streaming yet.  So don't anticipate being able to stream the newest show each week.
B000UX6THK|5.0|A series that was ahead of its time. Great mystery,comedy and romance all rolled into one. A forerunner to the X-files ?
B009SJ3GUK|4.0|My husband and I really like this show.  Sometimes I feel like the major plot lines are revealed a little too qucikly, so they have to add in new characters in every show to keep things interesting.  Overall - good show.
B003UYUR0G|4.0|Great Movie!! Love the games a lil better though. But still an awesome movie non the less..  I Def recommend!!
B0085RQLXK|4.0|As many would agree, Aerosmith is the greatest rock band. Ever. Period. The new album is pretty good - it's nice to get some new stuff. While I believe most of the songs won't make the greatest hits list, it's still refreshing to hear some good rock music in today's crap music lineup. As long as they keep rockin, I'll be happy!<br /><br />P.S. FANTASTIC concert in Wichita last month! Got to spend my bday with my boys!
B000W796OM|5.0|The movie came on time and just as described. I've already watched it a few times and it works like a charm.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|this is a pretty cool game and my free time is sucked up by it. my only regret is that if you can't best a level your done.
B00003CXI1|5.0|I couldn't find this movie anywhere else for the price that I paid for it. Came brand new and worked perfectly. I was really happy with the movie.
B000FA5SMK|4.0|Plum Island is a moderately paced mystery that keeps you engaged until the end. The characters are interesting and human.  Ending is believable. Good bedtime reading.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I loved these books and have read them multiple times. I would highly recommend this product as it was affordable and a great read.
B0076DCT2G|4.0|I thought the book was slow at the beginning.  Toward the end it got more exciting.  I thought they would never get to Yemen for a while there.
B000W746GK|5.0|After my previous copy got scratched I needed a new one for my collection. This movie came promptly and worked perfectly.
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|I have this game on everything I own.  Its the best game ever. I really love it.Nothing else to say.
0547884591|5.0|The 4 Hour Chef was my Herajuko moment. It provided the motivation I needed to reopen my copy of 4 Hour Body and change my lifestyle. I have lost 20 lbs in 2 weeks making the delicious meals as outlined in the 4 Hour Chef.<br /><br />Thank You Tim Ferris.
B009O2XY12|5.0|I really like this app. I wish that the play time was longer. I would highly recommend this app to all.
B002SSUQFG|1.0|I should have known to return the watch, when I opened the box & saw the watch running. There was no plastic clip on the watch stem which is the case with new watches. Following the setting directions, the watch did not keep time. Had to purchase a new battery.. & even now it is 'hit or miss' if the watch is correctly keeping time.
0446580848|4.0|I was very disappointed with The Lion but figured I'd give DeMille another shot with this book and I was pleasantly surprised.  It's a fast paced thriller with decent narration (I think the Corey character is starting to become a parody of himself though) and sets the scenes well.  I'd recommend this book, especially for fans of the series.
B003G4W49C|5.0|I enjoyed this, though I saw the ending coming from a way off. Weird that the same thing might happen with drones nowadays...
B000GCFY0I|2.0|I know this book is pretty popular, but I don't understand why. I normally love this type of book, but I found this book completely lacking. The characters were dull and not developed. I had no interest in finishing the series.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love doing crafts and trying new things.  My only problem with pinterest is I have a hard time leaving it. Lol
B0084BMUFA|5.0|I saw a musical based on this book and I hate to admit this but I had never read the book and decided it I should. It is a great story. I loved the language and the message of the book.
B00A3DZ61W|5.0|Wow, this game is awesome! Even people who don't care for the franchise can appreciate the details. When you can kill piggies and deflect laser bullets with your very own laser, that's when this game truly stands out and becomes on of my faves! Great job Rovio!
B007HACDLK|5.0|It's a Vince Flynn/Mitch Rapp book. What more needs to be said? This particular story has a good balance of action and intrigue, and the story line is pretty timely given current events. it's definitely worth reading at least once.
B0073LWEXK|5.0|This app is beautiful! Time and effort has been put into this app, and it is obvious! 99 cents is a great value for this app. It is challenging and don't use the spoilers, it is more fun trying to figure it out. If you love adventure games, this is a good buy! :-)
B007SGLZP8|4.0|Alittle slow at first but then it picks up and is good. This is the first book I used my Kindel.
B004SIP8OI|5.0|I love it because it was cheap and it arrived early than I thought it was new and well preserved.
B0091REZMW|1.0|do not like it I had to reinstate the game twice cuz it kept kicking me off every time I went to my friends pages and sometimes even when I get on it, it just kicks me off for no reasons and the diamonds should be in the things u could find in the rooms and keep them
B002Q1YDLI|4.0|Follow up to Something Borrowed.  They are both good books.  Fun and easy reads, I can't wait to see the movie!
B009JBZH54|4.0|awesome price for all 3 movie on blu-ray considering if you got to target and buy just the dark knight rises on blu ray your going to shell out 30 dollars. my only thing is im reading other reviews and people have already received theirs and mine hasn't even shipped yet. i ordered it the 4th of November and thought i would get it on the release date of the 3rd movie. WTF AMAZON
0316017930|5.0|I started this book on 11/28/12 and was halfway through it<br />By 5pm while @ work. I like how the book gets into a successful persons<br />Life @ age 17 & under since most ppl know who successful ppl are now.<br />This was my first book I've read by Mr. Gladwell & I already<br />Have his other books on my wish list.
B003B02O3C|5.0|IT WAS A REAL PAGE TURNER.  I WAS DISAPPOINTED WHEN  IT ENDED.  LOVE HIS NOVELS.  I NEVER DID FIGURE OUT WHY IT WAS CALLED THE RAINMAKER, THOUGH.
B000N2HBSO|5.0|I am really enjoying this book, so much information about day to day events and decisions, comfirming what a great man Lincoln was.
B003B02O0U|5.0|IT WAS AWESOME, AS ARE ALL OF HIS BOOKS.  I WISH THERE WERE MORE.  I CAN UNDERSTANDING WHY IT WAS MADE INTO A MOVIE.
B00914JWSW|5.0|If you love Barbra you will love this new CD. One of my favorite songs &#34; hom&#34; from the Wiz is on it. That was worth the price in iteself.
B007ZLKK9I|5.0|I'm not usually a biopic person but when I saw this on Amazon I had to watch it.  I love George Harrison and this was very entertaining, some biopics can be very boring and factual.  I loved the beginning and seeing George's early days, seeing his evolution as a person and artist.  It's a little long at just over 3 hours I think, but I'm not a person who is very good at sitting still for more than an hour at a time. All in all I think Terry Gilliam does a great job of fitting a sampling of the amazing life of a musical icon into a movie.
B006OAB3ME|5.0|I saw the PBS special first and fell in love with the music. I think he does an amazing job. It is a very mellow CD.
B00A77II0U|5.0|Alawar does some fantastic HOG's.  Wish you guys would do more!  The graphics are good and the game is decently long, which is a problem with a lot of other developers besides big fish and G5.  OK story line, it's a bit out there but then aren't they all?  This game has some replay possibilities but it'll be much easier the 2nd time around.  Actually pretty easy anyway, 5 stars because it's fun and long.  Long equals worth the money to me!  If you love hidden object games as much as I do then this one is definitely worth 3 bucks.
B0063M22QO|5.0|I love playing Mahjong on my Kindle Fire.............it is easy to play and I take it where ever I go..............
B007SGM084|2.0|First book boring unless you like same subject over and over. Starting skipping over the same parts. Second Book OK and Third book boring. It's the same story, different verus  --- Pretty Woman --- etc  boring !!!!!
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|I love this game, I play it everyday with family members, so I purchased the game for my Kindle Fire HD
B005LAII12|5.0|Probably one of the funniest movies I've ever seen.  Buying DVD for my my husband for stocking stuffer for Christmas.
B009GGWX5E|1.0|As the other reviewer indicates, if you want the properly recorded and edited Japan show, you want \\"This Time Around: Live In Japan\\". That double disc is leaps and bounds better than this sorry compilation. Don't make the mistake of getting \\"Last Concert In Japan\\". You'll regret it.
B006S08RLU|5.0|Amelie is a delight of a movie, full of lovely idiosyncratic details that endear each and every character. We're all quirky, with little proclivities that make us each unique and beloved, in our own weird way.  Amelie, as a character, is earnest and kind, yet odd, but you love her for it.  I love the cinematography. This is a total gem! Unless you have a heart of stone, you will love this film - and want to travel immediately to Paris.
B004O3YGMC|5.0|Not only can I remote to my MACbook with one tap of the screen but I am discovering new uses each time I connect!  It really is easy to set up and run. You'll love it!
0618871713|5.0|Bechdel examines her relationship with her father in the context of the different eras in which they lived---he, during a time when closeting was the only option for safe life as a homosexual, and hers, after the first decade of Gay Rights. That she did this in a graphic novel is absolutely perfect: her illustrations capture the nuance and punch of her text beautifully. Read it!
B003XT60KO|5.0|This book is a classic for a reason. The information is as relevant today as when it was written. I highly recommend this book.
B005NPCJ88|5.0|If you ever get a chance to see this band perform live, make sure you do.  They put on one of the best live performances I have ever seen.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|I am very skeptical about everything, but this book definitely gave me a lot to think about. The author's credentials definitely give the story much more credibility.
B005G4TJUC|2.0|There is a lot of killing, smashing, crunching, exploding, punching, kicking, and even romance.  The only problem with the movie is the plot.  OK--nevermind that every single autobot and 70% of the decepticons all transform into GM vehicles.  Never mind that a 19 year old kid and his girlfriend always seem to get access to top-secret information without any clearence.  Of course in this movie, he's running around with an M-16 machine gun and a grenade launcher with no military training.<br /><br />Megatron takes over Earth and declares himself ruler.  The biggest problem is that Megatron only has enough robots to take over New York.  Everyone seems to be OK with this and they send the Autobots away on a rocketship.  Earth is a planet of 5 billion people--technologically advanced and have nuclear weapons.  In previous movies, you can kill a Decepticon with three shots from a grenade launcher.  No one thinks to position a few battleships off the east coast and launch a couple of guided missles at them.  The robots shoot bullets and missles too, y'know.<br /><br />No problem, the Autobots were hiding in the highly explosive rocket booster the whole time.  They land safely a couple thousand miles away in the ocean, but manage to drive all the way to New York in about 30 minutes even though they can't transform into anything except GM cars.  They swoop in to save earth. Now we have a half dozen metal heros who all know karate and can kill all the Decepticons by punching and kicking them to death. In the end, the 19 year old kid manages to shut the power off of the Cybertron portal even though Bumblebee could've just blown-up the controls with his unlimited arsenal of missiles he has stored in his wrist.  The movie starts bad and ends worse.  Each sequal gets dumber and dumber every time.  I just wish the plot was as advanced as the CGI effects.
B007HACDLK|5.0|Excellent reading.  Lots of truth, although I know the book is fiction. Always awaiting the next book.  Author is one of my favorites.
B000NQRE9Q|1.0|It's a shame this box-set is ruined by that \\"fourth\\" \\"movie\\" staring Harrison Ford, tacked on like an unsightly cancerous blob. It's kind of like ordering a fancy gourmet burger, only to find out some big fat guy took a big spit on it before handing it to you. Sure, the buns, cheese, and ground beef are all of the highest quality, and quite tasty, but that fourth item, the spit, just ruins the whole thing. I'll stick to my Laserdiscs until I can buy the blu-rays individually thank you very much.
034580404X|5.0|This book was beyond amazing! I love this book, I got it for a great price and amazing shipping deals. My  friend is now currently reading them, I finished the books in 7 days! (:
B0063IH60K|5.0|awsome and fun to play.  if you liked to play this when you were a kid  you will enjoy playing this
B007HWTQQ8|3.0|I will start off by saying that I've seen many a violent action film and this is definitely one of the top 3 most violent that I've ever seen.  The whipping scene alone is perhaps the most violent scene ever filmed.  The effects were realistic in this and it is gruesome.  I will also state that I'm a Secular Humanist and while I believe the &#34;man&#34; Jesus Christ existed, I'm not convinced he did all the things the Bible says he did.  While I feel that Gibson was trying to give as accurate an adaptation as possible, I felt some of it was a bit hard to follow and in some parts it was about the movie making experience.  Some of it was over-the-top scenes of implausibility, and greatly unrealistic.  I am glad that I watched it, but don't care to see it again.
B00A77II0U|5.0|Another grate game by alawar. I play on my kindle fire and have never had any trouble out of their games. keep em coming!
B008RJFRTK|5.0|I was looking for a good map app for my Kindle Fire, this one is great, I now use it on my Android Phone
B009NPKTN6|5.0|I like musicals, the wife thinks I'm unusual, hooey to her. I almost went to see this in the theaters but Tom Cruise doesn't really do it for me so I waited a while to see this film. He did a great job, the whole cast was great, this movie was great, I watched it four times. If you like great casts, great music, and musicals, see this movie.
B007BT0RKG|5.0|I was looking for a good map app for my Kindle Fire, this one is great, I now use it on my Android Phone
B0091XRL86|4.0|My wife is a sucker for watching her niece, well we needed something to keep her from wrecking the house so we rented this. There is some other pirate show that she likes so we figured this would be a good one. The niece sat through the first viewing and didn't say a word. I would say that it is inoffensive and would pacify a five year old or younger for the entire run-time. The wife and I watched the movie another four times when the kids left, the first was to watch it through an adult's eyes. The other times wwere because it was a nice movie to have on in the background that didn't have violence and other bad stuff that is out these days. It's grown up enough for parents with it's adult humor that kids don't get, but it works for kids too. There is mention of the captain using babies for shark bait and other stuff like that, so if that is a deal breaker then wait till the little ones get older to watch this with them.
B004LWZWGK|1.0|Getting the UV copy for Dark Knight Rises in my collection was impossible.  I went to Flixster to redeem Batman Dark Knight Rises, tried to connect the accounts finally got it done and it wants me to pay for the movie & the redeem code expires on Dec 4th the day of the release...will probably return the movie and just get it on itunes so i can have it on my ipad, etc.
B008JH5CVS|3.0|I saw the previews and was pretty psyched to see this. I'm a big fan of Flixster and watch the reviews before I watch a movie. This one didn't get much praise so I didn't go see it in the theater. I've like Guy Pearce since The Time Machine, I never really saw him as an action hero but he really surprised me with this movie. It's totally mostly predictable but there are very few movies that aren't these days, if you like action and don't mind the lack of originality, I'd say give it a chance.<br /><br />The wife wasn't interested and I know her well enough to say she would have fallen asleep.
B000K8EQ5W|5.0|I enjoyed the story and the acting.  Sandra Bullock is really good.  I think this is one of her better movies.
B00AE2IJIE|3.0|I really wanted this movie to be something special. I'm a fan of the Tim Burton stop-motion films, this was not that. It didn't have that special feeling. The Nightmare Before Christmas felt like it happened in a real alternate reality, it felt big. ParaNorman felt like it happened in a shoe box.<br /><br />It was an okay story, just watch out if you have young children, this movie can be scary. It's sad too.
B00003CXB4|5.0|One of our animal loving family's faves!  Be prepared, though, the songs are so catchy they can get stuck in your head for hours!
B008KE3960|4.0|I haven't played this game for a couple of weeks, but when I first got it I stayed way later than I normally do. This is an addictive game, at first at leash for me. It's fun at first then when you figure out how to get it done it becomes monotonous, it got old after the first three days, but it kept me busy for many hours until then. Give it a try, I enjoyed it.
B00122OTZC|5.0|have loved this album since it came out years ago.  you will too when you listen to it!  Get it!
B009RI4FRU|5.0|My wife doesn't have a dry sense of humor like I do, she walked in while I was watching this, she lasted about two minutes. I love The Life Aquatic, I love Bruce Willis and Bill Murray, the whole cast was great. It's a fun story, if you like movies like The Life Aquatic check this one out. It was Super Great, I couldn't watch this movie the dozen or so times I watched The Life Aquatic, but the first go was great.
0316228532|5.0|I really enjoyed J.K. Rowling's new book, \\"The Casual Vacancy.\\"  It is the antithesis of Harry Potter, which shows that Rowling's storytelling skills branch out far beyond fantasy fiction.  While completely pessimistic, the book carried a dry wit and a perfect illustration of human nature that made the book very difficult to put down.  Rowling did such a perfect job capturing the vulnerabilities and oftentimes subtle cruelty that are so familiar that they could be those of people that any of us know or even of our own selves. I would recommend this book to any adult to read because it is a great, touching story of human nature where there is no black and white, good and bad, but just a grey area where we all are trying to live our lives in the pursuit of happiness, sometimes getting lost in the process.
B009HV2JT8|4.0|I like action movies and I like history, this was fun action, not a history lesson. I suppose the title gives away. I think it was passable. If you like action, and not thinking about stuff at the same time, give this movie a go.
B000FC1MM8|5.0|This is the first Connelly book I've read. However, I find his view of the American police detective to be real and refreshing. I will continue reading the Harry Bosch books. Michael Connelly's books are fun reads.

B003ODIZL6|5.0|This book should be use by everybody because it can help us in our school work and so much other things
B005CRQ4OW|4.0|Good book for beginner readers because it has lots of pictures on each page.  The content is only okay.  Not sure I always agree with the moral message.  But we read it together and discuss that we wouldn't normally be good if we acted that way.  My grandson is 7 and he loves to read them.  I figure anything that makes him want to read is good.
1451695195|5.0|I read Eben's book in a day.. I couldn't put it down and am just processing what I have read.. The reality is though that this experience happened in spirit and for my human mind to grasp this will be impossible. Like Eckhart Tolle says..\\"The voice of spirit is silence and everything else is just bad communication\\".. I commend Eben for the great attempt and job he did with explaining this near death experience in human language! It's a lot to take in but it's also like I always knew it. It helped me thread together different stories and experiences I have heard over the years. I am looking forward to the day when my veil will lift and I will be fully aware.. This reality here goes as far as our minds.. But spirit is endless and vast and eternal and that is something I look forward to being in more and more! Thanks Eben for sharing your journey!
0679804021|5.0|Great book for my 7 year old Grandson.  It is advanced topic, but with lots of pictures to keep his attention.  Typical Step into Reading series style with controlled vocabulary. Step into Reading does a great job at providing higher level topics at easy reading levels.  Many young kids want this kind of content.  Price is excellent.
B009HEP41A|5.0|Dario Marianelli has composed one of the most sensitive, classically inspired movie scores that have been created in many years.  His ability to orchestrate (with additional assistance form associates) is nearly matchless.  In his own words, Marianelli states `There are several themes in the score of Anna Karenina:sometimes appearing alone, often intersecting, their paths running alongside for a while. Those paths are shared by the characters in the story as they walk towards or away from convention, pretence, happiness, guilt, love, fun, and even truth. In a very important sense, the musical motifs do not represent the characters themselves I prefer to think of them as spirits, perhaps demons, unseen, signposting the way, or simply bearing witness to the events.'<br /><br />The handsome ItaloAmeriican Dario Marianelli received his first Academy Award for his work on director Joe Wright's  `Atonement' and also was also honored with another Oscar nomination for Wright's `Pride & Prejudice.' After viewing the film, especially the wondrously choreographed waltzes for which Marianelli composed unforgettable music, the viewer realizes perhaps for the first time just how much the musical score embellishes a film. As Marianelli states,  `I am quite familiar with a fair amount of Russian orchestral music from the 19th and 20th century. What I didn't know much of was Russian folk music, so I did some research into that. I listened to a lot of folk songs, and I recorded a few of them. A couple of very old tunes found their way into the score, and provided one of the elements of the musical world I was trying to create. I found it quite interesting to listen to the composers who started the whole idea of a Russian national school, Glinka and especially Balakirev, and to the folk songs they collected and used in some of their work. In the end I am not sure how much of that has gone into what I have done, but I am certain at least a little of that listening has colored part of the score.'<br /><br />In all, this is a CD that stands solidly alone, even without the visual beauties of the film, as an example of the finest in musical scoring.  Grady Harp, December 12he score.'<br /><br />In all, this is a CD that stands solidly alone, even without the visual beauties of the film, as an example of the finest in musical scoring.

B004LWZWGA|4.0|Christopher Nolan strikes again. Perhaps this is the final segment of the ongoing Batman epic, and if so it is going out with a big bang. The film lasts around 2 1/2 long hours but is packed with action and a continuing storyline that basically stays on line for the most part.  The special effects are fine and the cast is huge.<br /><br />Without summarizing the plot, we meet a physically and emotionally broken Bruce Wayne aka Batman (Christian Bale who despite his apparent physical limitations still maintains a hunky buff body - that is, the little bit that we see of him in this incarnation), grieving over his lost love form the previous episode, and disappearing form the public spotlight.  Even his trusty allies Alfred (Michael Caine) and Fox (Morgan Freeman) fear for his welfare.  But trouble arrives in the personage of Bane (Tom Hardy, completely unrecognizable in a funky mask) who is out to destroy all Gotham policemen and Batman. The good guys are Commissioner Gordon (Gary Oldman) and officer Blake (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) who stay in the fray despite the appearance of the vicious Selina (Anne Hathaway, who practically steals the show) and her associate Jen (Juno Temple). The supposed savior of the mess Wayne that has allowed to disintegrate as his foundation is a society dame named Miranda (Marion Cotillard), but of course she has other plans. The plan to destroy Gotham is planned by Bane and his associates and the rest is the long long long finale.<br /><br />The cast includes many bit parts for some fine actors such as Matthew Modine, Alon Aboutboul, Ben Mendelsohn , Daniel Sunjata, Nestor Carbonell, William Devane, Liam Neeson, Cillian Murphy, Tom Conti, and Desmond Harrington among MANY  others.  The writing is fairly well done and does leave the end as either a farewell or a jumping off for yet another installment.  Entertaining but a bit long and oblique.  Grady Harp, December 12

B008220C38|5.0|There have been many cinematic versions of Leo Tolstoy's epic novel ANNA KARENINA but for this viewer none matches the creative excellence and power of this very different version.  Tom Stoppard wrote the screenplay for this adaptation and the work was directed with eye toward timeless artistry by Joe Wright. There will be some detractors who feel that cinema is cinema and stage plays are stage plays, but Wright's decision to combine the two works extraordinarily well.  The flavor of Tolstoy's story and mood are maintained and yet made somehow more vital by Wright's electing to place this story as though it were happening on a theater stage (including catwalks, backstage, audience and theater boxes etc.) The story is theatrical and Wright embellishes the last of the Czarist days with great aplomb.<br /><br />The story needs no summary: Anna Karenina (Keira Knightley more beautiful to behold and brilliant in acting than ever) is married to Alexei Karenin (Jude Law in a tour de force acting role) and is happy in her station with her slightly cool husband but very warm young son. Then quite unexpectedly her eyes meet those of the wealthy Count Vronsky (Aaron Taylor-Johnson in a career making turn) and their love is immediate. The flirtation is enhanced by some of the most beautiful waltzing choreography on film. We are in St. Petersburg, Russia and divorce is something only a man /husband can initiate so as the love affair reaches a point of no return Anna must decide whether to bear the shame of a divorced woman or just be the mistress of the incredibly handsome Count and remain married. In contrast to the Anna/Vronsky duet is the passion of the country lad Levin (Domhnall Gleeson) for the aristocratic Kitty (Alicia Vikander) and throughout the story the two forms of love are paralleled. Anna becomes pregnant with Vronsky's child, an act that quietly infuriates Karenin as it makes Anna's affair public - a condition no one can tolerate in that society - and subsequently results in Anna's leaving her beloved son after she gives birth to the daughter belonging to Vronsky: Karenin will care for the child. The climax comes with Anna's infamous suicide and the story ends with all loose ends tied.<br /><br />The exceptionally strong supporting cast includes such fine actors as Matthew Macfadyen, Kelly Macdonald, Olivia Williams, Ruth Wilson, Emily Watson, Michelle Dockery, and Shirley Henderson.  The luxuriant costumes are by Jacqueline Durran, the cinematography is by Seamus McGarvey, and the glorious musical score is by Dario Marianelli. A Stunning Film.

B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Bought through Kindle along with the first two.  Moves very fast and keeps you wanting more.  Would recommend to anyone looking for some fun reading.
B009HV2JT8|5.0|Loved it. Wish they could have a sequel. With all the new Abraham Lincoln movies coming out, I'm like, where's the vampires? LOL!
B002ZG98LO|4.0|The more and more I think of this film from the first time I watched it, I become more impressed. It's the same way I felt about the film American Pyscho. The first time I watched both films, I didn't like them. Then they both grew on me after I gave them another shot. I love Sci Fi so I wanted to like this movie. Problem I have with Predators, is even though I thought it was very well made and very original. It could've been soooo much better. I like when movies tie into each other. And this could've tied into the earlier films allot. Since Predator 2, Aliens and Predators have been mixed and tied together which started the AVP franchise. Here's how I would have tied it in. In this story, people get abducted to this planet so the predators can hunt them like wild game. My thoughts were, if you survived and beat a predator...you also got abducted to do battle with the Predators. The dead solider in the beginning could have been Arnold. That could've ended that story there...And Lawrence Fishburne could have been played by Danny Glover. This could have tied Predator 1 & 2 even more so then just Alice Braga's character. The alien ship could have had  Weyland sign on it as well. Just these 3 changes could've made this movie a great one. Instead, it's just a good one.

B005XLN97M|5.0|I received this item for a 9 year old who just recently decided she liked Barbie dolls again and needed a house.  Her favorite part is the floating stairs.  They are actually usable and Barbie can walk up and down them!<br /><br />I found it super easy to assemble.  Everything snapped into place correctly and the house seems very durable overall.  I also like the size.  It fits the dolls well without being so big that it takes up half a bedroom.  It's well designed to have everything a house needs without being a monstrosity.  There's a living room, bedroom, small kitchen, and a bathroom.<br /><br />The attention to detail is great.  We loved all the accessories and food items it came with, but it wasn't to a point where there were 100 little pieces.  All the accessories were usable in play.<br /><br />I would highly recommend this item.  The price is good, the size is great, and everyone loves the stairs!
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|This is one of two games I start my day with.  Coffee,  smoke and my kindle.  Perfect start. It's.  almost impossible to get all the way around, but that's part of the challenge,  isn't  it?  It doesn't keep pestering you to buy more,  or give it a 5 star rating.  I like that.  You will not be disappointed with this app.  (The other one is &quot;spades &quot;.)

0547884591|5.0|I'm a huge Timothy Ferriss fan, and I think this book is his favorite book yet. While I don't personally agree with everything he puts in his books such as part of the slow carb diet, his outside the box thinking is revolutionary. Especially the meta learning parts of the book, and all the skills to learn and to apply to other skills as well.

I wish I weren't allergic to nuts and that I could try to follow this diet.
B008HK3XU4|5.0|Don't waste your money on a leather case. This one is so much cheaper and more convenient because of the way it clips in and allows you to sit it in your lap! It's durable as well.

B005WUHAX8|2.0|I got this case in July and as much as I love it, I just found out Amazon doesn't sell the actual LifeProof case. I called the LifeProof company today because a gasket fell out of my case and they informed me that this is a counterfeit case. I am not impressed. If I were you I would pay the few extra dollars and order it from the real LifeProof company.
B00447L4KA|5.0|This movie has become a classic and a must-see for every teenager. But know one can really say why... I dont know how many times I've seen it, but I enjoy it equally as much every time. The plot is a modern Shakespeare of two sisters who are not aloud to date. One is popular and the other one is no (longer) interested in boys or superficial things. So when the new guy at school falls for the younger, popular sister he has to find a way to take her on a date. The father of the two sisters finally gives in and says that the young,popular sister can date when the older sister dates. So what does the new guy do? Hire someone to take out the older sister. But will it go as planned?<br /><br />If you have not seen this movie and you like chick-flick/comedies (and the late Health Ledger), then you have your movie for the next rainy day. I would imagine it to be a perfect mother-daughter movie as well.
B005I6EVUG|4.0|I bought this to use for my Kindle Keyboard, although based on the description & packaging it is primarily designed for the Kindle Fire. I saw it in a store a year ago and kept putting it off- after all, I have a perfectly good case! But in the end my love for travel and this design's lovely scrollwork won out.<br /><br />Pros:<br /> - Style. I love the travel theme, the rich red color, and the soft leather-like material. The dark gray interior means it blends into the Kindle, rather than standing out. For me this is a good thing because when I'm reading, I don't want to be distracted by the case.<br /> - Quality. The stitching is tight and the scrollwork is nicely done. It doesn't feel like it's going to fall apart any time soon.<br /> - Pocket. The interior pocket is the full size of the case, which also means that anything you put in there is less likely to interfere with your Kindle when it's closed. However, I do wonder how difficult it would be to get something small (like a business card) out.<br /> - The fold. The area where this case curves and bends over (so you can read it like a book) is very pliable and soft. There's no painful cracking sound or stiffness, so it doesn't feel like you are hurting the case by opening or bending it.<br /><br />Cons:<br /> - Interior fabric. It almost feels like a very thin neoprene- soft but strong, and the lack of fuzz means it picks up pet hair a little less. However, after one week of use it has grayish streaks on the interior curve (where you fold it over) and over the pocket area. The only things that have touched the interior of the case are a pillow, my hands, and my lap- and previous Kindle cases haven't had the same issue. It just looks dirty.<br /> - Straps. As others have said, this only has basic elastic straps. They do appear to be relatively sturdy, but I do not like their placement. I assume this is because the case is built to fit both the Keyboard and the Fire, but the straps are actually attached to the case well under the Kindle- you really have to stretch them up to fit. At first I thought the Keyboard might not fit, but it does once you stretch it.<br /> - Size. Again this is likely because it fits multiple versions, but there is nearly a half inch all around the Kindle. That adds nearly an inch of unnecessary size and bulk.<br /><br />Overall, I like this case and will continue to use it- the cons aren't enough to make me toss it aside.
B008ASLK8A|4.0|Another great movie about Sherlock Holmes. The acting is flawless and the plot is good, but it is still something missing for me to give it 5 stars. Maybe because I enjoyed the first one more....but it is still a good movie.
B00881VLCE|5.0|I like how you choose the level of hardness.  Enabling the rotating piece feature makes it just like a real puzzle.  But instead of it covering the kitchen table it stays in the palms of your hands.  Controls and responds well with the kindle fire.
B006LSZECO|5.0|She is such a great storyteller.  I did not see all the twists and turns coming and love the whole thing.

You really do feel for Peter, and how much of a DICK Gene really is, as well as Paul.  Just remember there are 4 sides to this story and somewhere in all that is the truth.

B008YWY0HK|1.0|The only good thing about this movie was the animation and music.  Story wise, it was the deepest let down imaginable!  The \\"funny\\" parts weren't funny at all and involved the people being naked from the waist down ( shown from the back )... I expected more from Pixar.  I'm ashamed that this \\"Princess\\" is to be added to the list of Disney Princesses - she's a spoiled brat. Never going to buy this movie... going to stick with the older and better Princesses that deserve to be remembered!

B001IBIHQ4|4.0|The Pacific is a good show but for some reason it just wasn't as entertaining as Band of Brothers. Band of Brothers allows the viewer to understand the characters much more.
B007HACDLK|5.0|Extremely exciting, a real page Turner and it will hold your interest in a busy room. I have read all of Flynn ‘s books and this one ranks at the top.
B0015DRPJU|5.0|First of all, my wife made me read the Twilight series and while I didn't hate those books The Vampire Academy series is a superior read in my humble opinion. &#34;Shadow Kiss&#34; is the third book in a six book series (Bloodlines is a new series in the same world) and I really enjoy the way the author brings life to every character, especially the main protagonist, Rose. I won't spoil the book for anyone but for those who wanted Rose and Dimitri to finally be together you will probably be happy and then brought to tears. Overall I love this author's work. She is a fantastic writer with an eye for the dramatic. I would highly recommend this book (as well as the entire series) to anyone who loves a good paranormal adventure with a dash of romance thrown in.
B000I9VOO4|5.0|Love this movie - The DVD was the 50th Annv Edition had additional DVD discussing the making of the movie.
B004TI5N38|3.0|Not up to his best, a good story that moves along. End seems too abbreviated almost as if it were truncated to save paper.
B009JZWO3I|5.0|A favorite of ours, it moves at a slow but building tempo and there is always something we learn about the law from watching.  Characters are intriguing.

0060930349|4.0|I discovered Paul Johnson through his shorter, later works, like Socrates: A Man for Our Time and Jesus: A Biography from a Believer. After reading Intellectuals, the hugely entertaining and informative collection of profiles beginning with Rousseau, I decided to try one of his mammoth \\"big picture\\" histories. And A History of the American people certainly fits all the above descriptions--entertaining, informative, and mammoth.<br /><br />Johnson begins with the Portugese and Spanish exploration of the New World but rapidly narrows his focus to the English settlements that would eventually rebel and establish the United States. He devotes time to each major colony among the original thirteen, from the profit-hungry tobacco farmers of Jamestown and the fractious Calvinists of Massachusetts to the wealthy planters of South Carolina and the late buffer-zone military settlements of Georgia. Johnson describes the general character and trends of each colony, relations with the Indian tribes, and the introduction and expansion of slavery. The story expands the longer the book runs on, with westward expansion from the coastal colonies beginning early and exploding following the American War for Independence. For most of the book Johnson capably moves between topics, people, and events, even as the material he has to cover becomes overwhelming. He only falters, I think, in the final quarter of the book, but I'll return to that later.<br /><br />Johnson is remarkably even-handed in his treatment of contentious issues, such as the exploitation of Indians and slaves, avoiding demonization but condemning where condemnation is due (he refers to slavery as the \\"organic sin\\" of the United States). He has opinions and has no compunction about sharing them, which is mostly refreshing.<br /><br />He is also, as I noted before, an enormously entertaining writer. Copiously on display is Johnson's talent for the character sketch. He has a gift for physical description and the telling detail as clues to character, and so Aaron Burr is \\"a sharp-faced New York lawyer;\\" Abraham Lincoln an \\"awkward [man who] always put his whole flat foot down when walking . . . but could suddenly appear transfigured, full of elegance;\\" Andrew Jackson carried \\"hideous scars and bits of metal in his anatomy;\\" Jefferson Davis had \\"a propensity to challenge critics to duels, though he never fought any;\\" JP Morgan with his swollen red nose \\"terrified people;\\" and Lyndon Johnson \\"was an inveterate bottom-pincher.\\" Johnson also relishes the mudslinging of yesteryear, and his passages on the rivalries and hatreds among the Founding Fathers (especially the peevish John Adams) simultaneously destroy the notion that \\"The Founding Fathers\\" were a monolithic group with universally shared ideals, and make the reader roar with laughter.<br /><br />And the book, despite dealing with huge topics over vast stretches of time and geography, is very well paced for the most part. Johnson shifts between times, places, and topics smoothly, which helps greatly in painting a picture of the United States as a whole with millions of parts. He covers high politics--such as the drafting of the Constitution or Jackson's war against the National Bank--and bottom-up \\"people's history\\" equally well, and his passages on normal people during the Colonial era and early 19th century are exceptionally good. His sections on 19th century literature and popular culture in the early 20th century (especially jazz) are also good.<br /><br />But things begin to go off the rails somewhat following the Civil War, which is roughly the half-way point of the book. After the Civil War the book becomes far more topical or analytical and far less of a narrative, as the swings between Johnson's subjects take longer and longer. This becomes especially acute toward the end of the 19th century, as Johnson devotes enormous space to demolishing the idea of the \\"robber barons,\\" but the book still moves along well and doesn't bogdown. That changes beginning with World War II. Here the balance between top-down and bottom-up history ends and the bottom-up view falls completely away. From FDR onward the book is primarily a history of presidents and policies, especially once JFK enters the White House.<br /><br />As I said above, Johnson has obvious opinions and isn't ashamed of sharing them, but his desire to debunk the myth of Kennedy's \\"Camelot\\" administration gets the better of him, and so the reader is treated to a conspicuously long section on Kennedy, his father Joe, and their myriad shady dealings. Such detailed treatment wouldn't have been out of place in Johnson's book Intellectuals (perhaps he should write a follow-up called Politicians), but in such a broad survey it smacks of axe-grinding. And at such a late stage in such a long book, one begins to wish such passages were much shorter or cut altogether.<br /><br />Johnson also has some curious ideas about America. He views democracy, federal power, and the office of the President as the ultimate goods of the American experiment, and a running theme in his History is the adoption and expansion of those ideas. He writes, in one of a handful of flat-out errors in his book, that in the Constitution created \\"a very strong presidency--or, rather, an office which any particular president could make strong if he chose. . . . These powers were not explored until Andrew Jackson's time\\" (189). This introduces a kind of weird whiggishness to his story, so that anything moving the United States in a more democratic direction is good and anyone resisting a powerful centralized government is at best misguided. That the drafters of the Constitution may have viewed democracy as a bad thing (which they certainly did) never enters Johnson's thinking, nor does the idea that Jackson (among other later presidents) manipulated his office.<br /><br />So Johnson's History of the American People is idiosyncratic and has odd undercurrents, but that doesn't make it a bad book. It's informative, a masterpiece of construction in its first half, and perhaps most importantly, it entertains. That alone makes it a worthwhile read.<br /><br />Recommended.down.

B002PQ7JQK|1.0|i ordered the 3 season blu-ray original star trek series. at first glance i saw that 2 seasons were packed as cardboard and 1 season plastic.  it looked like left over blu-ray dvds taped together.  the outside cardboard package was ripped inside and was moving loosely.  very poor.  then i tried the first dvd and the voice was skipping at different parts and the visual effects were terrible.  it should have been a very shart picture as blu-ray but it wasnt.  might have been better if i had ordered the original dvd package and not blu-ray.  at least the cases would have looked much better.  i had saved 6 months for this blu-ray series and was very upset and disappointed with amazon when it showed up like this. the picture shown on amazon was not what they sent. i received 3 separate cardboards taped together and not a nice blu-ray set which was what i expected to receive as shown on the amazon site. also my blu-ray player is new and works very well with other blu-ray discs i have.  its not my player.

B0008ENICU|5.0|When Clark Gable asked that his Director George Cukor be replaced on Gone With The Wind - he did him a great favour. About a week or so later Cukor began shooting the 'The Women'  and with his deft touch was able get the best from his strong all-woman cast.  Norma Shearer - a great favourite of mine - is spot on with her portrayal of Mary  Haines, whose husband has an ill advised affair  with the grasping opportunist Chrystal. Shearer plays Mary with humour and dignity, a role that in the hands of another actress could well have been melodramatic,even maudlin.<br />Joan Crawford was the biggest star (female) at MGM for a long time - mainly because she was the working class role model for so many members of the audiences that flocked to see her, in the thirties and forties. Chrystal is more of a villain than even Miss Crawford usually played, but she plays her with her usual Crawford bluntness and toughness, and brings out the characters deception and plain old rat cunning, very well.<br />Rosalind Russell was a witty, intelligent actress who developed into a wonderful character actress, as seen in The Majority Of One (with Alec Guinness), the musical Gypsy, Picnic (with Bill Holden) and the Citadel (with Robert Donat).<br />But, when playing a quick thinking, fast talking , comedic role Miss Russell really came into her own. I couldn't imagine anyone else being able to match it with Cary Grant in His Girl Friday as Rosalind Russell did.<br />In 'The Women'  Miss Russell's flair for comedy is infectious and her performance is another very good one.<br />Paulette Goddard (was her career in decline when this was made ? Her role is not a major one in 'The Women') gave her usual solid effort. Marjorie Main and Lucille Watson both added humour (Main) and wisdom (Watson)  and were good contributors, as was Mary Boland  (ah l'armour,l'armour)  who reprised her Broadway role for this film.  The only \\"silly\\" characterisation was left to Joan Fontaine - were women ever as naive as she ?<br />Amazingly, 'The Women\\" stands up well today - and I think that says a lot about the cast and more importantly the Director, Mr Cukor.  When one realises this was the man who directed so many of those wonderful Hepburn/Tracy films, we can appreciate that whilst GWTW may not have been his forte - well scripted comedies such as ' The Women', certainly were.

B0076DEJMO|5.0|Breathtaking, bloody and beautiful.  As always.<br /><br />Unlike his earlier works, Red Country breaks a bit from the bleakness of the world created by Abercrombie.  We see the Bloody Nine as ... sweet, in his own way.  We see westward expansion and talk of rebellion against the Union.  And for perhaps the first time ever, we see the Union actually fail at something.  A superb read.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|This book was hard to put down. The fact that I knew the history surrounding World War II did not detract from the intrigue. Follett was able to intertwine family backgrounds from Russia, Germany, Great Britain and the US into the greater picture of the good and evil of war. Follet has a talent for writing an intriguing fictional novel set in well reserached hisotical facts.<br />I am really looking forward to the publishing of the third in this trilogy.
0316069434|5.0|The BLACK BOX is another welcome entry into the long running Harry Bosch series. My initial impression is that it isn't a classic, but Bosch is still Bosch and he still has the drive to deliver justice, even if it is to a case that is twenty years old. Bosch is still working old unsolved cases with partner David Chu. With the 20th anniversary of the LA riots approaching, Bosch pulls out the files from an old case that he was just involved with on the outside during the riots. A Danish photojournalist, Anneke Jespersen, was found shot to death in an alley during the riots. Bosch and his partner were called to the scene, but didn't have time to properly work the case before being called to another murder.<br /><br />Now, twenty years later, they may have a track on the gun that killed Jespersen. Bosch pursues the lead and moves slowly, tracking the history of the gun before finally finding the black box, or the nugget of information that will finally allow the case to be solved. It may be entirely possible that Jespersen wasn't just killed as part of the riots, but because of something much bigger.<br /><br />I love the Bosch series and Connelly's slow paced writing and characterization. This novel has some funny moments with Bosch and Chu and some good moments with Bosch and his daughter Maddie. The 20-year old case doesn't quite have the sense of urgency as when Bosch is matching wits with a serial killer or a crime in progress. However, Bosch's slow, dedicated pursuit of justice is what keeps the series going.

0307341577|5.0|After finishing DARK PLACES, I've read all three Gillian Flynn books. All three are true page turners, and this novel hooked me in a way the other two didn't. The lead character, Libby Day, turned out to be a bit disappointing, but the story was fascinating, haunting, chilling and engrossing. The haunting story begins decades ago when Ben Day is accused and convicted of killing his mom and two sisters while little seven year old Libby Day escapes to the barn to escape her brother's satanic murdering rampage. Libby hasn't fared well in life. She drifts between men, she constantly battles depression, and she has no responsibility.<br /><br />She's never faced the truth behind the crime. A group of true crime buffs approaches Libby and offers to pay her if she'll talk to them and talk to others involved in the crime on their behalf. That is the setup that allows Libby Day to play private detective and look into what really happened that fateful day. The story structure alternates between the present day and Libby investigating what happened with the events of the day of the murder.<br /><br />Libby's testimony is what convicted her brother, and she's never doubted he was guilty. But, what if he didn't' do it? What really happened. Could her drug dealing loser of a father had something to do with it. What about Ben's loser girlfriend and her drug dealing pal, Trey? Flynn really nails the culture of the poor, lower class people of the small Kansas farming town where the novel takes place. The poverty of the Day family is truly depressing.<br /><br />Flynn's structuring of the plot is also very impressive. In the present day, Flynn slowly reveals all the facts that were used to create an impression of Ben as a Satan-worshiping monster. But, when we are taken back to the actual events of that day, we learn in real time what happened, and how many of the incriminating items had explanations or motives. Needless to say, all is not as it seems.<br /><br />The weak part of the novel is Libby Day. She's a fascinating character to begin with. She survived the murders, made it through a disastrous adolescence, and drifted through adulthood. She's used men, never had a job, and never wanted responsibility. Her past offers so many layers, but many of those are buried for much of the novel as she plays the role of competent private detective. Her irresponsibility and weaknesses never really play a role in her discovering what really happened. Libby was a weak and damaged woman when we met her, but she is all to normal in the novel.<br /><br />In spite of the darkness of the novel, I loved it. It is one of the few that I actually made extra time to read. GIRL GONE is the novel that brought fame to Gillian Flynn, but this novel is just as good.novel is Libby Day.

I mean actually I saw it twice because I felt like I must have missed something. so I'm glad I saw it, but perhaps writers didn't have a conclusion?

B004TRKH9O|5.0|So this is Tangerine Dream's third album from 1971, back in their early days when they were more droning than melodic (ie., it's nothing like Tangram). You won't find the repeating arpeggio-like sequences on this one that you find on Phaedra from a couple of albums later either. In fact parts of this album remind me a lot of Rubycon, but this one is darker and more haunting and less rhythmic (still has rhythm though), has a kind of sci-fi/horror soundtrack feel to it. I really enjoy listening to the beats - by which I mean the way the frequencies of the different synth sounds interact with each other so that they constructively interfere.<br /><br />This album is ace and I enjoyed it because of how moody it is. All the tracks have their own character to them so it doesn't get too monotonous. Probably my second favourite TD album I've heard so far (which includes Electronic Meditation, Phaedra, Ricochet, Stratosfear, Force Majeure, Tangram and Exit).

B000VMFDW2|5.0|As a child growing up in between wars, it is always hard for me to understand what happens to a man put in the inhuman field of combat.  &#34;Sledgehammer&#34; conveys the horror, the futility, the insanity of war without glorifying the senseless violence found in many other accounts.  He thinks, he feels, he tries to understand from a grunt's eye view.  No mock heroics or sensationalism, he helps you to see how difficult it was for anyone to endure the camoaign and emerge sane and human.  Above all he conveys the binding sense of camaraderie that kept  these boys together and won the war.  Although not a new book, the pain, the curiosity, the humor and the sadness come through as if yesterday.  It should be required reading for our kids.

1402793375|3.0|Having grown up in a time when the Indian is the hero/victim in U.S. history (I get the sense that prior to the 1960s, Indians were largely vilified), the book gets a bit tedious.  Scholarly?  Not really.  It at times uses highly emotional language and deliberate glossing over of Indian atrocities to make its point -- that the U.S. Government treated Indians shamefully.  This is undoubtedly largely the case, and I'm guessing that in its day it was a fairly fresh historical voice.  It seems there was, no doubt a deliberate policy of dehumanization of Indians to facilitate the theft of their land and justify extreme measures of all kinds, and treaty after treaty was broken.  But reading it 40+ years after publication it doesn't hold up very well; Army massacres of Indians are told in the first person and in great detail, while a following sentence might be \\"and angry braves killed 11 white settlers in response.\\"  Just to take Geronimo's case -- I'm currently reading \\"Geronimo\\" by Robert Utley -- Geronimo and his braves killed hundreds of Mexicans and Americans, many of them non-combatants.  Women and children brutalized, tortured.  Why?  Well, simply because raiding was part of Apache culture, as a way of gaining goods and validating men as warriors.  In cataloguing the sins of the era, why would Brown totally ignore this, unless he intended to write a polemic, and nothing more?<br /><br />And the author's analysis is shallow -- how about some examination of cultural differences that exacerbated tensions?  How about some detail on the politics of the day that influenced Government action?  His point would have been easily made with a bit more objectivity, for after all, the facts will speak for themselves.<br /><br />All in all, an interesting read, and the pictures are terrific, but look elsewhere if you want something more in depth, well-researched, or balanced.
B00943SQCI|4.0|Johnny Depp did an okay performance in this movie with pretty good supporting actors.  Good fast paced storyline with only a few weak spots.  Don't skip out or you will need to rewind to catch up on a detail that is important to what is occurring.  Overall a pretty good movie and worth the money.  Tim Burton, as always, does a fine job capturing the darker aspects of the situation and building the drama to it's conclusive ending.

1476715904|5.0|Layken \\"Lake\\" Cohen is not impressed when her mother decides to relocate her and younger brother Kel to Michigan, after the death of their father. When she arrives at their new home and comes face to face with the 21 year old hot new neighbour Will Cooper, Lake decides that the move to Michigan may not be so bad after all. An instant attraction develops between Will and Lake and within a matter of days they go out on their first date, where Will introduces her to his passion for poetry Slams. When Will gets on stage and performs his Slam, Lake is moved to tears when she discovers that his parents died two years ago and he is raising his nine year old brother. When he gets off stage and wipes away her tears, they share their first kiss and their connection intensifies.<br />Their romance is short lived when on the first day of school, Lake comes face to face with her poetry teacher ... Will Cooper. Both in shock as the realisation confronts them, Will advises Lake that they cannot continue to see each other, as he cannot risk losing his job as a student teacher. His responsibilities of raising his brother and paying off debts left by his parents need to be his priority. With heavy hearts they co-exist in a world where they find themselves in close proximity whether in class or at home, as their brothers have become best friends and are constantly running across the street to each other.<br />In a moment of weakness they share a kiss and Lake admits to Will that she is falling in love with him and will wait for him until she graduates from high school. In a burst of anger Will dismisses her feelings and tells her that she deserves better and he cannot give her want she needs. Hurt and angry Lake's retaliation is to come up with her own poetry slam in class, directed straight at Mr Cooper. But when Lake discovers her mother is dying of cancer, the first person she turns to is Will, who gives her the comfort that she needs. Hurt that her mother wants Kel to be raised byher best friend and refusing to deal with her mother's illness, Will becomes Lake's friend and forces her to confront the reality of life and death.<br />Having accepted that her only relationship with Will can be one of friendship, Lake is shocked when she unexpectedly arrives at Thursday night Slam and discovers Will on stage declaring his love for her in his poetry slam. Realising that Will is not expecting her to be in the audience, Lake rushes off before he sees her and runs into one of her classmates. Insisting that he walks her to her car, he grabs her and begins to kiss her while she tries to push him away. Will appears and a fight begins between the student and the teacher. As a result Will is transferred to another school, leaving Lake thinking there is no reason for her and Will to remain apart. When Will pushes her away again, Lake decides she's had enough and maintains her distance from him. As she shuts him out of her life, her mother finally admits the real reason Will pushed her away and its up to Lake now to fight for the man she loves.<br /><br />\\"Slammed\\" is an amazing read which I could not put down from the first few pages. The emotion of the storyline sweeps you away and the intensity of the relationship between Will and Lake is so eloquently written that you can feel their connection. When they come face to face at school for the first time and they realise the student teacher connection, you feel your gut clench as you know what this means for their relationship. The supporting cast was fantastic and contributed significantly to the story. The younger brothers Kel and Caulder were so entertaining in their comedic moments, yet when Kel tells Caulder over family dinner that his mum is dying, tears came to my eyes as you felt the power and emotion in that statement. Then as typical nine year olds they go back to being totally inappropriate, with Caulder expressing how cool it will be that Kel will also have two dead parents. Eddie and Gavin were also great characters who provided that balance for Will and Lake.<br />The overall storyline is heartbreaking as you have Will giving up his life to raise his young brother after the death of their parents in a car accident. Then the unexpected death of Lake's dad from a heart attack and then when you find out that Lake's mother Julie has lung cancer, your heart breaks as you think how much more can these young adults go through. Being forced to grow up before their time, you admire them for their strength and forgive them for their idiotic moments and you fall in love with them time and time again, as Colleen Hoover has written such rich characters and tells a very poignant story. When you get to the last chapter and realise Julie is gone, you feel the sadness of their loss, but the story continues in \\"Point of Retreat\\" so you wipe away the tears and start on the next book.

0547884591|5.0|I pre-ordered the 4 Hour Chef and anxiously awaited its arrival (as I have with all Tim's books).  I absolutely love the recipes and ideas for incorporating the protein and raw foods into my diet.  I have followed Tim's diet ideas from the 4 Hour Body and have had the luxury of seeing 100's of people following Tim's suggested workout/diet change their overall health.  Lower body fat, MORE muscle right before my eyes (Body Composition Center in Redwood City, CA).<br /><br />I cannot say enough about the book; its interesting information not covered by any medical texts I have read in the past.<br /><br />Kindle version a must... this book is HUGE.
B004UID2LC|5.0|I really like this YouTube free. Easy to use and the quality of the music is very good. I recommend it.

B000QCS8TW|5.0|I LOVE these books. They are very raw at times, but the characters are the kind that you get attached to and they make you NEED to know what's happening to them. i have never watched the tv series based on the books, but honestly, i don't think you'd need to. This series has made its way into my picks for all time faves that I read ovr and over.

B001974DG0|5.0|&#34;Watchers&#34; was my first introduction to author Dean Koontz.  I read it several years ago and found that it was a real page turner.  I couldn't put it down!  After loaning it out to so many of my friends, my copy became so battered that I had to buy another paperback copy--which I still have.  To ensure that I never lose this excellent thriller, I now have it on my Kindle.  I have been reading Dean Koontz ever since I read &#34;Watchers&#34;!
B00A5052YE|5.0|I recommend Alicia's new album, she did a wonderful job, love her collaborations as well, she was on Fire when she did this album.
0547884591|5.0|This book was highly anticipated in my household and it delivered as promised.  I'm only three recipes in but the advice has already been life altering.  When I started eating healthier 7 years ago,I've always forced myself to eat eggs in the morning (based on the advice from the South Beach Diet and  upgrading to the Slow Carb Diet years later).  Ever since I was a child I hated eggs, but with the advice from Tim and the flavor combinations which he suggests...I can't wait to eat them every morning and find myself eating them for dinner as well.  The fact that all the recipes are SCD friendly, I can't wait to try more.  I'm not a seafood fan but I look forward to trying Tim's take on them to see if I can broaden my tastes.<br /><br />Aside from the book, I love all the bonus material that Tim offers on his website through the book.  I'm big on customer reviews when shopping and always love Tim's product suggestions (he's the ultimate reviewer).<br /><br />I bought the hardcover and Kindle copies.  The full color Kindle copy looks great on my Android.  Well done.

B001PA0FFO|5.0|There is no need to describe the great performance of the excellent cast for this movie.<br />The Doubt has to be seen with an open and flexible mind for those belivers and non-believers because the focus is human behaviour and not the religion/church behaviour.  There is a positive approach on human nature: everywhere there are people with good intentions and bad intentions, people full of pride and people humble, people using the means for themselves, and people using the means to give more.<br />With the attacks to the church, this movie puts on context how not ALL the people in the church are bad or ALL the people in the church are good.  &#34;This world crisis is the crisis of Saints&#34; meaning that when there have been people damaging and corrupting the environment, there have been holy people doing great things.  It also shows the responsibility that all members have to ensure compliance and loyalty in any environment (family, work, sports, church).<br />The story has it's very funny details showing living contrasts related to generosity, sobriety, mortification and women/men approach to situations.

B000TDXPSC|5.0|I just bought a second pair of these headphones...not that there was anything wrong with the first pair; on the contrary. First set I bought about a year ago for a pro DJ at \\"Natural Forest Club\\" in Rodeo, Santa Catarina, Brasil. He heard of the quality and wanted a pair. Second set was for the announcer's booth at \\"Trentino Radio\\" public radio station in the same town. Quality phones, light weight, great sound quality!

This app is very addicting, I find myself spending hours to add to my boards and now I have tons of boards with tons of pics on them.  It really has alot of categories and lots of things I like!!  I love it!!
B004LWZWGK|5.0|First off don't expect this to top it's predecessor The Dark Knight since there will probably never be a movie that can do such a thing. Having said this though The Dark Knight Rises is another outstanding story and visual marvel from director Christopher Nolan. Beginning grabs you with an amazing airplane to airplane kidnapping and the story takes off from there. Every actor holds their weight but Tom Hardy in my opinion steals the show as Bane. This is an epic finale to this trilogy that has made Batman a \\"real\\" superhero again. The ending leaves some questions and possibilities, so fingers crossed that DC and Nolan can continue making Batman's universe into such amazing and captivating movies!
B005SFS4ZU|4.0|As other reviewers have said, The Phantom of the Opera at Royal Albert Hall is the closest anyone can come to watching the live production without actually being there, aside from a few changes.<br /><br />As many of you know, The Phantom of the Opera is about a deformed musical genius who is obsessed with a young aspiring opera singer he has taken under his wing, posing as her Angel of Music, never showing her his face for fear of rejection. He has never known love from another person before and stops at nothing to obtain her love, not even when Raoul de Chagny, a handsome and wealthy man from Christine's childhood, reenters her world.<br /><br />I was first introduced to the story when the 2004 movie was released and saw it live on Broadway once in 2006. I've read the original novel and most of the book adaptations available through amazon. I guess I would call myself a seasoned 'phan'. I was super excited when I discovered this, since I've been longing to see the show on stage again but obviously tickets are expensive and currently there is no US tour of Phantom.<br /><br />I really enjoyed this performance a lot and even though there were things that were different (small and major), I still think this is a worthy addition to any 'phan's' collection. I would suggest buying it on Blu-ray because the costumes and set designs are simply magnificent. Everything is very sumptuous, high quality, and pleasing to the eye. Sierra Boggess (Christine) pretty much steals the show as she portrays a frightened and lost young woman who is striving to tear herself away from the memory of her deceased father. Sierra's performance brings Christine's character to life. She is strong yet naive, searching, and desperate to be free of the Phantom. Some may say that her style of acting is melodramatic, but I think it's apprpriate for this sort of musical and there's no denying she put every ounce of her heart and soul into her acting and singing.<br /><br />Hadley Frasier (Raoul) wasdifferent from how Raoul is commonly portrayed. Frasier brought a more take-change, demanding, ballsy sort of Raoul which is in contrast with the traditional sweet, gentle, charming, brave portrayal of the character. I found that the strength of his and Sierra's performances detracted from the power and menace of the Phantom. Even though Raoul is generally not a character who backs down to the Phantom, even when his life is threatened, Frasier came across more as angry and explosive. There's a part near the end when the Phantom has released Raoul from the noose and Christine has to restrain him from beating the Phantom to a pulp (and I believed without a doubt he was caapable of doing so.) This made the Phantom appear a lot more powerless for someone whose presence should dominate in a very sinister way -- but I just didn't feel it with Karimloo's portrayal of the Phantom. I suppose it made more sense to portray Raoul this way since he later becomes a drunken, gambling, wife beater in Love Never Dies.<br /><br />My least favorite part of the show was Ramin Karimloo. I know A LOT of people love him, but I just couldn't connect with him. Ever since Gerard Butler played the Phantom in the 2004 movie, I've noticed a trend of young, sexy Phantoms. The thing is, I love Gerard Butler as the Phantom. He's menacing, mysterious, sinister, preying, and yet the audience can still connect with him on a deeply emotional level. I didn't find Karimloo to be any of those things. He was not compelling in any way. He has a nice voice and everything, but he's not scary or intimidating and doesn't pack the punch the role requires for the show to tie together (this is all just my very humble opinion.) I tried really hard to like him and find what others appreciate in him, but still nothing clicked.<br /><br />Karimloo's best moment is in the PONR scene. That scene was done very well and is charged with sexual tension. This is probably the only part I connected with Karimloo's Phantom. There is a moment when Christine embraces him from behind and he reaches for her with trembling, vulnerable hands. Aside from the three main characters, I really enjoyed Madame Giry and Carlotta. It was refreshing to see a more complex version of Carlotta, even though I like the charicature too. The music is wonderful, as always, and there were some nice surprises at the end. It was interesting how they portrayed Christine as reluctant to leave the Phantom after their kiss. It was nice to see something different, but it was a little jarring to see such a drastic change in her behavior toward the Phantom and I wondered if they made the change to support the premise of Love Never Dies, which I don't and will never accept as a true continuation.<br /><br />Even though I was not toally satisfied with Karimloo's performance, this is still a really good show and I think people should go into it appreciating the fact that they're performing live and giving it all their best. Some people may not like how the chandelier doesn't fall or that the mannequin of Christine isn't present during the lair scenes, but those differences seem minimal in respect to how flawlessly the actors and orchestra deliver their portrayal of this timeless story.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Absolutely love it. I can't get enough of the walking dead. I can't wait for February to get here so I can find out what happens.

B008MG1E4A|5.0|For anyone who is interested in the process of training and the step by step progression of the Bin Laden raid, I would highly recommend this book.  Easy to read and follow along with great information on what actually happened.  I am not a big reader, but was pulled into this book from the beginning.  I would recommend this book to anyone interested in the true facts of what happened during the bin laden raid, from a person with first hand knowledge.
B005UA0FLE|5.0|he is the best!!! Love it! Would do more reviews if you didnt have a minimum number of word requirement...hows this working for you?
B005GFPZYK|5.0|The book started out a little slow, but I would recommend it to anyone.  Once you get into the book you start to realize what these men have to go through in order to get the job done and you get to see the rules and regulations that our government puts on them.
B0052BZ6X8|5.0|Good movie lots of action and great story plot. I do wish they would come out with a second movie to continue this story.. there is more to the story I belive.

B000069KE0|5.0|It may come as a surprise to many people, say anyone born after the early '60s, that once upon a time Chicago was a great band. David Remnick, the New Yorker editor, in a recent endless paean to Springsteen, mentions that he first encountered Springsteen when he was going to a Chicago concert, and dismisses them as worthless and forgettable. Not quite. I can't think of another band that has been as long-lived and spent so much of the latter part of their career grinding out such utter crap, but Chicago II (originally just called Chicago before they went to roman numerals, the first album having been put out as Chicago Transit Authority), released in 1970, showed a tight, creative, diverse, jazz-rock fusion band at the peak of their capabilities. It was all downhill from here, as Peter Cetera gradually took control of the creative direction of the band and steered it into a mountain of saccharine fluff. The suite that covers side 2 of the original double-album, \\"Ballet for a Girl in Buchannon\\", is a wonderful medley of songs, with \\"Colour My World\\" with its Bach-esque arpeggios becoming a hit. \\"25 or 6 to 4\\", a song about insomnia, drugs, and creativity, has one of the classic bass hooks of all time. Throughout the album the horns are integrated with rock guitar in a synthesis that truly works, only matched by that of Blood Sweat & Tears. It would be nice to hear more good stuff in this vein, but it must be really hard to do.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|It was a wonderful book. If for any reason you are considering not buy it,stop right there and immediateately purchase this book. I will make sire that all of my friends and family will be reading this book very soon. So sad that it us over.
B009VLX8FS|4.0|I really like &#34;I knew you were trouble&#34; and &#34;We are never ever getting back together.&#34;  However, I couldn't tell you about any other song on the album.  Its a fun album, but a lot of the songs sound similar.

B004J4WKUQ|5.0|\\"Ready Player One\\" is a rendition of the Hero's Journey that's custom tailored for the nerdy geeks in all of us.  Whether you get every reference or only a few, it's a fun ride.
B009NOVCTM|5.0|Love The Rolling Stones and have all of their DVDs.  This is a great collection of thier music at a decent price.
B000N2HBSO|4.0|Awe inspiring narrative of Lincoln and the approach he took to working with generally the best people he could gather around him ... highly recommend.  Would have given 5 starts ... although well written and engaging I still measure all historical biographies against those written by Chernow ... comes close, but Chernow's books are the best writing (for me anyways).
B007SGLZP8|5.0|The story leaves the reader on the edge as the story develops.  As the reader goes farther and farther into the story one cannot put it down.

B007FEFLTO|3.0|Not as good as the normal Follett books.  My interests kept me to continue reading as much as the storyline.
B004LWZWGK|1.0|I purchased movies in the past with an UltraViolet digital copy.  Big mistake - HUGE.  I spent hours trying to just get into the accounts they are forcing me to set up and then I could not download my movies.  What a waste.  I would give this movie - The Dark Knight Rises - five stars for the actual movie, but the inclusion of this crap \\"digital download\\" makes this a one star movie.  I searched and searched for a version with an iTunes download - my preference - but to no avail.  Amazon, don't sell this UltraViolet digital copy crap.  I cannot get my movie from UltraViolet/Flixster.  I do not want to stream the movie I purchased, I want to download it.
B004DK5CW4|5.0|This is a great movie of a wonderful horse whose fame shall last forever. There will be no other like him!
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I resisted reading this trilogy because I felt I wouldn't like it. I was completely wrong! When I finally sat down and started reading, I couldn't put it down. I read the whole series in about 4 days. I enjoyed it so much that as soon as i finished the 1st book I wenr out and bought the movie. its funny because my 15yo son read this when it first came out and told me I would like it but I didn't listen. Now he is creating a list of different books to read since we like the same things, thank you Suzanne for giving me something else to bond with my son over!!
B007HACDLK|3.0|I'm not saying anything bad about this book as it is kind of a comeback after Vince Flynn's illness. Kind of like coming back from Tommy John surgery for a pitcher, it takes a while to return to full strength. I normally think of him as a five-star writer so expectations are high.
B008AX18Y6|3.0|has its lengths, good beginning, good when describing political, religious ideas, too long and boring when describing friends and life
B009LDCZDC|5.0|After watching through the whole first season of Homeland, when Nicholas Brody returns home as a decorated POW who survived 8 years of captivity, I had no idea how season 2 could top the event-filled first season, but as of episode 8 it doesn't disappoint, providing plenty of action and suspense.  Claire Danes and Damian Lewis are great choices for the roles of a Marine who is struggling with his allegiances and the CIA agent who happens to fall in love with her mark, and have magnetic chemistry together.<br /><br />The first season included Brody's homecoming to his confused family and his involvement in a plot went wrong, as a result of which he questions his actions and must decide who to side with.  In this second season, Brody's obsession with Carrie (and vice versa) is coming into play as he tries to navigate his precarious position and try to keep his family safe while at the same time do \\"the right thing.\\"
B0096BIENY|5.0|Although I have not received my cd as yet, I know I will love it. I have all their cds and dvds. I have not regretted ordering any of them. They are all very talented young men and have beautiful voices. I have not had the privilege of seeing them in person but would to if they ever come to Arkansas. I could listen to them sing 24/7 and never tire of them. God certainly blessed these young men with a fabulous talent for singing. It just melts my heart to hear them. I'm no spring chicken at nearly 70. My favorite singers.
B003AYDPYQ|1.0|Buy this thinking you'll get to watch it on TV and you're ripped off by Amazon. It will only play on the iPad itself, not to a TV attached to it.
B005K17RU0|5.0|I use this app all the time when I'm not at home! works perfectly and I can see everything I'm doing clearly
B009CPJHY4|5.0|One of those movies that makes me feel like a better person for having watched it! It reminded me of another favorite of mine 'Enchanted April'.
B007HACDLK|5.0|As usual Vince Flynn's story is relevant to today's current events and set up the next book is he chooses to go in that directioin.
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|This is a fantastic SciFi novel. It combines the best of both nostalgia, current culture (geek culture), and new ideas related to those themes. Fascinating concepts, interesting characters, and fun writing all make this a wonderful read for anyone who likes games, science fiction, or just plain' ol' good books.
B004SJ3AXI|3.0|For whatever reason I think the season's bird theme is a reach.  I don't care for the feel of the games like the original Angry Birds.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Back to his old writings, super impressed, happy happy. No better writer period. This work was easy to read, and was finished in two days.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Mark Owen (Pen name) did a good job with this book.  I believe he did a fine job in the area of OPSEC, unlike the folks in the Obama Administration.

B007C3TVEY|5.0|This film is an extraordinary portrait of a mother (nicely played by Tilda Swinton, a truly great actress) struggling with a psychopathic* child -- although this viewer was stunned by the amazing performance of Ezra Miller as the teenaged son, which dominates the second half of the film.  The director begins with disjointed moments from mom's life in true (and perhaps slightly clichéd) Indie Film style, but this technique works as it should here to disorient us and fill us with a sense of dread and impending doom.  We know something terrible is going to happen.  Nothing, however, prepared me for the powerful work of young Ezra Miller.  He can summon a coiled intensity like a cobra preparing to strike.  Several of his scenes are quite simply unforgettable for their preternatural stillness and menace.<br /><br />The director wisely opts not to show us the deaths of the students Kevin murders -- only the aftermath (seen early on in the film).  What we see instead is a long shot of Kevin shooting arrows in every direction, a sequence less distasteful than shots of the actual carnage would have been.  I think we have been desensitized to violence by countless dozens of movies, so the director's decision here is very wise, and the result more chilling than the alternative.  Equally memorable is the scene early in the film when the mother visits her son in prison, when all we see of him is the row of fingernails he has bitten off and carefully lined up on the table between them.  The huge gulf between mother and son here becomes palpable.<br /><br />There are also some fine bits of irony in the screenplay:  The kid is always sucking up to his dad, who teaches him to shoot a bow and arrow -- the same weapon later used to kill dad.  The finest scene of all may be at the end of the film when mom visits Kevin in prison for the last time:  His spirit seems to be broken (clearly prison has been hard on him), and he finally becomes the sweet son she always wanted.  Here Ezra Miller is superb -- almost unrecognizable as the same boy we have come to know.  This sort of thing is the very definition of great acting.  The music score reflects some irony as well, consisting rather surprisingly of country songs that provide a deft counterpoint and commentary to the mood of the film.<br /><br />This film is not recommended for expectant mothers, but urgently recommended for everyone else, both for the fine work of director Lynne Ramsay and the superb performances by the actors.<br /><br />(*Those interested in this subject should consider reading The Science of Evil: On Empathy and the Origins of Cruelty by Simon Baron-Cohen, a Cambridge psychologist best known for his research on autism and the lack of empathy).
B009APMNB0|1.0|Tried this with window 7 and a Dell monitor.  It was difficult to load and then it turned everything Green.  Hair, shadows, faces, just green.  I called the manufacture and they gave me a bunch of double talk.  This is advertised as simple to use but it just did not work that way for me.  Now I need to figure out how to  undo the damage it did to my computer and monitor.  Does not work as advertised.
B001KVZ6HK|4.0|I saw this movie in the theater, and I should probably state up front that I'm a huge fan of Marvel Comics, and I like the direction they are going with their movies. Treating them as sci-fi epics more than gritty action flicks. (I'm looking at you &#34;The Dark Knight Rises&#34;!) There's not much more that I can say about the movie that you can't read 1,000 times in other places.<br /><br />Other reviewers have mentioned the packaging, and - yes - it sucks. This is a standard BluRay box with extra disks literally stacked on the spindles. It's a cheap, cheesy move on the part of the studio, when they could have presented this in a nice fold out package. Is that a big deal? No, not really, unless you want to watch the 3D version of the film, then you have to juggle the disks around into some meaningful order.<br /><br />The 3D, by the way, is spectacular! I almost tossed the 3D dsik, because I din't have the hardware to watch it on, and seemed like something I didn't need. Since that time my family has purchased a 3D compatible television and...just wow! It's not necessary to enjoy the film, but it certainly doesn't hurt!<br /><br />So, the bottom line is, if you're looking for a good character-driven sci-fi action flick with strong actors following an exciting script shot by a more than competent director. This movie delivers the goods. If you already love these characters, then you already own this movie, and there's nothing I can tell you that you don't already know.
0525953728|4.0|The Seals were around LONG before Obama, they are OUR team, not his. But glad he gave them the GO-AHEAD on Osama. It was a good read and he gave a good deal of background on what happens BEFORE you can become a member of Seal Team 6. By the way some people say, &#34;There is no Seal Team SIX, and that is because some years ago they changed their name to DEVGRU, which is short for the full name, U.S Naval Special Warfare Development Group (DevGru) instead of Seal Team Six.<br /><br />My wife and I both read and enjoyed it. We would both recommend reading it.<br /><br />Why only 4 Stars? It didn't hit me like some books that I am moved by and think that would make a great movie. However, I do think it would still make a very good and historical movie.
B00004TS0E|5.0|This is a great movie for the whole family.  Mara Wilson as Susan really steals your heart.  Richard Attenborough really depicts the spirit of Christmas in his role as Kris Kringle.
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|Too bad Larsson's father and brother won't let his girlfriend finish the fourth book.  You'd think they would want some more revenue.  Great continuation of Lizbeth's story.  I, like other, would have loved to have seen her and Michael finally get together.  Oh well.  Great series while it lasted.
B009IJJ5B4|4.0|I didn't like the beginning of this series being a Holmes aficionado, but its growing on me.  The Holmes character is filling out nicely and the stories are getting better.  I would like to see a bit more depth and complication to the mysteries though.  Holmes is getting off easy.
B0086700CM|5.0|I love this game because it is fun for all ages and easy for all ages love this freaking game
B004LWZWGK|3.0|This movie definately had it's pros and cons. Overall it IS a good movie.<br />DVD/Bluray product: The quality of the BR recording was excellent. This is a pro. A con is, why can't they put ANY special features on the BR disc? The purpose of a BR disc is that it holds much more data and should hold everything. I have 3 discs in my set. BR, DVD and special features. Having to change discs just to see some behind the scenes feels like a waste.<br />Movie: The twists are ok. Nothing to scream \\"You gotta see it\\" kind of twists but they are there. Overall movie was fun to watch.<br />Con: Fight scenes where so slow and clunky. Anyone who has ever trained in hand-to-hand HAD to see this. If 2 fighters were so well trained in advanced martial arts yelled, grunted and telegraphed EVERY move like this, they'd be laughed out of a dojo or killed on the street in a real fight.<br />I did not like their alternate universe version of Bane. Why was he an \\"up-talker\\"? If you don't know what one is, I am sure youtube has videos. It's funny once or twice but it was annoying here. SPOILER: Since when was Bane ever a part of Ras Al Ghul's guild? I never read anything like that in the books. He was from South America and although he was already a big, fast fighter, he was enhanced by drugs. SPOILER: he loses one hose to his mask and it pretty much ends his fighting spirit? COME ON! I know in the comics he lost his venom so he lost the fight but it was still a fight.<br />The final twist...(no spoiler) That was NOT his real name.<br />All in all, the movie was a good action romp but for a purist comic fan, it falls short.
B00881PPTO|5.0|I've used the Kayak app for a long time now, mainly when flying to keep up with schedules and look for alternate routes.  It's nice to not have to deal with ads anymore.  Hotel search also comes in handy when traveling with a loose schedule.
0812982622|5.0|I approached this novel with not a little trepidation, given its bleak subject and the promise of some truly dark material. But \\"The Orphan Master's Son\\" turns out to be the rare novel that truly expanded my world, by bringing me to places I would never otherwise go. Johnson's six years of research are evident on every page, and his North Korea is vibrant, detail-rich and fully lived in. At the same time, this novel is no academic treatise -- it's a ripping good yarn, spanning kidnappings in Japan, adventures at sea, survival in a prison camp, and terror in an interrogator's office. There are even moments of black humor, courtesy the honking, idiotic loudspeaker blaring propaganda into North Koreans' living rooms and places of employment at all hours of the day.<br /><br />In any case, for a reader looking for a gripping adventure, I can't think of a book more worthy of your time than this one. It is my favorite novel of the year.

B0071XO8RA|5.0|I was absolutely transfixed by this book. I finished it in four nights of staying up way too late. I read it on the Kindle, and it was not only beautifully written, but there were no grammatical or typographical errors, which I'm finding is a rare thing in Kindle ebook editions. Mr. Howey is obviously a very smart man, and he writes for an intelligent audience. The book is so well thought out that every question I asked myself while reading was answered in the next few paragraphs. The descriptions and dialogue ring true, and some lines are so vivid and well-written that they will forever stay with me.<br />Before reading this book---SPOILER ALERT--- realize that you will be introduced to characters that you will come to love and care about who will be unceremoniously ripped from the pages leaving you in shock for a while. The first book is especially grim and at times almost too claustrophobic to bear--but you will get through it, and there is a worthwhile pay off. In book three the author softens up a tiny bit (some of your beloved friends will still be taken from you), and the story starts to veer off course a little (some characters turn into caricatures), but he gets it back on track and brings it to a satisfactory conclusion.--END SPOILER ALERT<br />If you are actually claustrophobic or prone to panic attacks, reading this may trigger an episode, so be warned. There are some emotionally wrenching scenes and lots of scenes where you will struggle to catch your own breath.<br />I give this book my highest recommendation. I could not disagree more with some of the critical reviews that stated it was boring or long on descriptions. I couldn't put the book down, which is saying a lot as I usually have three or four books I'm reading at one time. This author is a poet and artist who paints a masterpiece with his words. If you're wondering what type of books I like to read to see if we have the same taste, a small list of some of my favorites are Ender's Game and Speaker for the Dead, The Lord of the Rings Trilogy, Neuromancer, Stranger in a Strange Land, The Bartimaeus Trilogy, The Wheel of Time Series (Books 1-4), A Fine Balance (historical fiction), Atlas Shrugged, Harry Potter(yes, I read them all and liked them), and Illusions.<br />Wool is destined to be a classic and some savvy entrepreneur should option it as it would make a terrific miniseries.
B002M87V0A|5.0|I fondly remembered The Music Man from my childhood.  So, I encouraged my children to sit down and watch it with me.  Next thing I knew, my wife had joined us and we passed a delightful evening together watching the story of a flimflam man with a change in store.  Terrific music will stay with you for years and a great story for kids.  In a way, the tale works a bit like the Simpson's.  There is a level at which a younger audience encounters what is happening and a deeper level for adults.
B007MDB548|5.0|It's a beautiful plot packed with excitement and emotional appeal in which the movie continues to keep the audience engaged in  the story line. Viewing 3D was great, had less ghosting in my Samsung UNC8000 and the sound effects were good. Combo pack was a great treat.
B005L38QK2|4.0|I can't say enough great things about this mouse.  It fits either hand and is easy to set up.  The keys can be bound to any keybard function.  I've been click click clicking away and the buttons have worked much longer than any other mouse i have owned.  Two set backs? While the mouse is covered in a nice easy grip yet smooth material, if you get a nick in it it become irritating.  Secondly, the cord is wrapped in a mesh materal so if it bends and presses against anything it tends to make mouse movement inaccurate.  Why? Cause it's a stiff mouse cable and with the normal soft movements i make, the slightest resistance and i miss the normal placement of the cursor.  Other than that it is a well designed mouse.  Comfortable and accurate and unlike some pro gaming mouses that are super sensitive, if you barely raise it off the mouse pad by say, the thickess of 3-10 sheets of paper, the lazer sensor doesn't shoot the cursor off the screen or become totally inoperable.<br /><br />Good Buy!

B004LWZWGK|5.0|For starters, I didn't watch TDKR on theaters.... I only watched it today after my blu-ray arrived... I bought it because I already had the previews ones and it was the last movie of the trilogy, so I got it.<br /><br />I'm too thrilled after watching the movie that I'm gonna review it in different aspects...<br /><br />Sound: the sound effects are just amazing!!! It came with dts-hd, the best sound for movies in my personal opinion... The blasts, fights, environmental sounds really make you feel close to the action... As if you were in Gotham city during the whole movie... The soundtrack is also great.... It follows the previews movies style, making you vibrate along with the story... It dictates the \\"mood\\" so well I just couldn't imagine any other soundtrack for this movie. It fits just perfect!<br /><br />The image: the blu-ray version comes in full 1080p, with excellent lighting, contrast and color vibrance. The movies runs smooth and the image is so great you can't take your eyes off the screen... You don't even want to blink, afraid to miss something...<br /><br />The plot: Nolan made a really great work with this movie. It has tons of fast-paced action, it has despair, it has hope, it also has emotions.... These are so well mixed up along the story you just can't wish it was better.... Of course there are some differences between comics and this movie adaptation, but its a great movie.<br />I got many surprises during the movie... The story comes filled with revelations and surprises.... During the movie, there are so many revelations that almost everyone would probably say; \\" oh my... I just didn't see that coming...\\" The movie is a piece of art.... I enjoyed this movie so much I feel sad it was the last one.... Was it? The movie itself also prepares the viewers for a possible and most expected sequel....<br />There's nothing else to say.... The movie is so great it speaks for itself... If you're a Nolan's batman fan, it's a must have... No matter if you'veseen it in the theaters or not, it's a must watch action movie... And I'm pretty sure that if you watch it, you'll love it.
B004LROMSO|4.0|*Two very mild spoilers below*<br /><br />You must understand, I am a big history buff. So when a friend and I went to the theater some time ago and I saw the trailer for this, I was both elated and saddened (as I don't have Starz.) When I learned that the brilliant mind that helped craft The Tudors, another of my favorite (albeit historically innacurate) series, I was on board, one hundred percent. And while I may have had to wait for streams to go up online to see it, you better believe I was waiting eagerly in front of my computer screen every weekend.<br /><br />The basic tale of King Arthur is known by all, so no need to repeat that. Here, King Uther has recently died, and his quick witted daughter Morgan sees this as her perfect opportunity to claim the throne she has so long coveted. Merlin, however, has something else in mind. Arthur, having been raised in the countryside unaware of his parentage, is quite surprised to find the sorcerer in his home spewing tales of being the son of a king. Merlin sees a future in this boy, a way to mend a country torn apart by warlord kings, and it will all start in one place, a crumbling stronghold that will stand as a beacon for a new era: Camelot.<br /><br />It's pretty much common knowledge that a lot of peopele don't like this series. Even as a fan, I admit there is some to be desired, and certain things could have gone better. But there is still a lot to appreciate.<br /><br />A big sore spot for a lot of people is the casting of Jamie Campbell Bower as the well known king. While yes, I'm sure someone out there could have carried the role better, this choice wasn't a horrible one. This Arthur is not the one we tend to immediately think of. This is a young, aloof Arthur, who doesn't know a damn thing about being king, and would frankly rather be at home with his foster family than thrust into the middle of medieval politics. Even halfway through the series, he's still coming into his own. Had the series continued, I feel like we'd have gotten to see different sides of him, and see him grow.<br /><br />There are, as to be expected, historical innacuracies. This is a medieval show, after all, and sometimes that is forgotten. A previous reviewer mentioned the episode where a young girl is nearly forced to offer up her virginity as compensation for the land she and her father live on. And they were right; in a teeny tiny medieval settlement like this town, this is commonplace. Even far after this time period, landowners were able require women's virginities as payment from those beneath them, and there was no denying a person who was above you in station. This is given a modern treatment of \\"ohhh, that poor sweet child shouldn't have to give up her virginity to the big bad man\\", and while in the end it turns out it is mostly because the two are secretly related, it still is something that would probably have never come to light in real life. Now, in the show's defense, as I said, this is a young Arthur, one who would probably still believe in childish idealism and who would undoubtedly take trouble with this sort of thing. On a completely different note, something that really irritated me is the big boo-boo that is Morgan's parentage. Morgan is the child of Igraine and the Duke of Cornwall, along with her sister Morgause. She is NOT a Pendragon.<br /><br />Despite the ups and downs, there are two shining gems that really make this show: Eva Green as Morgan, and Joseph Fiennes as Merlin. Firstly, this is a different Merlin than the wizened, bearded figure everybody imagines. This is a dark, brooding Merlin, one whose past is filled with sins and who may not be all that sane. The series seems to hint that the reason he hides his power is that it once got out of hand and killed his family, but this was never cleared up before the cancelation. Then, of course, my favorite part of the series, the goddess that is Eva Green. Not only is she stunningly beautiful, but she pulls off the role ofcold, calculating enchantress like she was born for it.<br /><br />Really, I think that Camelot had many chips and cracks, but with a little patching up (that is, to say, more seasons) it could have had a lot of success. Every show starts off with baby steps, this one just never had a chance to work on its toddler years, so to speak.cold, calculating enchantress like she was born for it.<br /><br />Really, I think that Camelot had many chips and cracks, but with a little patching up (that is, to say, more seasons) it could have had a lot of success.

B006BGZJJ4|5.0|No problems with these things at all.  I ordered three of them and they have all worked as they should.  Nice solid cable that feels sturdy and well made, but still soft, flexible and user friendly.  No different than the stock cables that came with the Kindle.  The low profile micro-usb end is great for cell phones, especially when put into cases, where often times the stock cables won't fit correctly if at all.<br /><br />UPDATE:  After several months of owning one of these, I ended up purchasing two more.  The original cord hasn't had any problems, and it's seen daily use in some pretty harsh conditions.  I'm thoroughly impressed.  This thing hasn't loosened up, still fits perfectly, cable hasn't cracked or broken and I've nothing negative to say about it at all.
1400067820|5.0|Welcome back, Mr Taleb! After a rather disappointing phase for fans of Fooled by Randomness, cashing in on the financial crisis with The Black Swan and television appearances discussing investment tips and hyperinflation, NNT is back to his old form with this treatise-cum-memoir on the role of chance in life and how to deal with it. Unlike The Black Swan, Mr Taleb obviously spent a lot of time on the historical context and philosophy of the conflict between what he used to call Roman vs Greek thinking, and presents it through the key aspect of fragility vs antifragility, breaking a few Greeks in the process. In my opinion this is spot on and very smart indeed, and ties together loose ends from his previous books into what you might call his masterpiece. It definitely benefits from having read his previous work, but also in isolation offers some very thought-provoking new ideas while summarizing old ones (such as the barbell portfolio strategy, \\"Turkeyism\\", power laws and Extremistan). This is definitely not an investment book, more an entertaining philosophy read encouraging modern minds polluted by rigid academic curricula to unlearn our over-reliance on prediction and direction ('teleology') to unlock the power of asymmetry while staying safe in the process (i.e. the barbell strategy). Fun to read and worth to reread.
B009LK6JS2|2.0|You start out with a plane flying. No take off, but whatever, its called carrier landing right? So lets land this plane. You are shown where you need to land. Turn on the afterburners and go.  2 minutes later your still flying, and bored. Fun...? No, just boring. Finally you get to the runway or carrier. What then...who f'ng knows.  There are 3 sets of controls on the sceen, but none of them instruct you on what they are.  So you try a bunch of things. Landing gear down, try to land...crash. That was stupid. Try again... Now your flying again. Another couple minutes doing nothing. bored...again...dumbest game.

B000I9U9A4|5.0|I found myself gravitating back to Master and Commander throughout the years.  Then out of curiosity for the books, I read the whole series by Patrick O'Brian.  After finishing the last book, I had to buy the movie to complete the circle.<br /><br />Great movie!  The attention to detail to the books made the movie that much more enjoyable. (The wine stands before you!  Not a moment to be lost.)<br /><br />This is a must have for Patrick O'Brian fans and casual fans of great storytelling.

The shiniest, brightest star of the show has to be Jason Bonham...not only does he pound it home in true Bonham-sque power, but provides wonderful harmony vocals to Plant on a couple of songs in the show!

B008Y2FRFO|4.0|The Good:<br /><br />* Free!<br />* Ad and 'coin shop' buttons are not in the way<br />* Simple gameplay (ages 4+)<br />* Rewards and incentives<br /><br />The Bad:<br /><br />* Repetitive<br />* Coin regeneration is slow<br />* Full page ads come up periodically if game is left untended<br /><br />The Bottom Line:<br /><br />Coin Dozer replicates the classic carnival game with accurate physics and good-enough graphics.  Kids are able to play it with minimal ad interference and the 'coin shop' button is not the biggest button on the screen (thankfully!).  Safe enough for the kids.
B00AHSIQWE|4.0|Being a guy, I'm always a sucker for action adventure movies and the comic book genre has always been a favorite. I loved the Iron Man movies, the X-men were OK. I never liked any of the pre-Christian Bale Batman movies. Michael Keaton, Val Kilmer, George Clooney. I like all these actors but they just weren't given a good script or director in this series.<br />This movie was far superior than any that have come before. 2:45 is a long movie to sit through but I was never bored. The story, the action, effects, were all good. If I have any complaints it was with the Bane character's ridiculous mask and voice. And then the 'oh so obvious' surprise betrayal of Miranda. I saw that coming the moment Bruce got cozy with her.<br />Other than those two things it was still the best of all the Batman movies.<br />Well worth the rental price and well worth watching, but I feel no desire to see it again.<br />I wish amazon would realize most of us feel that way about most movies. We just want to rent them, not buy them. Give us the option of just watching them once for $3.99 and not having to buy them.<br />My wife really got onto me about how stupid I was to be buying movies from amazon, when I could buy the DVD for the same price and never have to rely on internet access to watch them again. As happens all too often, I realized just how right she was. I won't be buying anymore movies here. Just renting. And maybe a lot more from Redbox for just $.99. You might want to think about that, too, Amazon. I frequent two gas stations every day that have Redbox kiosks. A lot cheaper rentals.

UV is not a true \\"digital copy\\" it is a pain in the butt scheme for Big Hollywood to enhance their consumer research  divisions as well as limiting the consumers right to legally copy their purchase onto their portable electronics.  UV sounds nice, in the test lab.  But when I have to login into two different websites, download a program unto my MBP and then I am only able to watch my movie when I have a Wi-Fi connection.  Sure, UV would work in an airport, at Starbucks/McDonalds, but when I am driving crossroad I do not have Internet access and therefor UV is next to worthless.<br /><br />In short, Warner Brothers go back to old digital copy system to make the consumers happy.  If I buy a movie that has UV \\"digital copy\\" I will get my digital copy via other methods, as will other ticked off tech savvy consumers.  Stop worshiping the profit margin and start giving the consumer what THEY want.

The sound quality is near perfect. The special features are a bit lacking and the trilogy seems ripe for a special edition trilogy pack sometime next year.

B0063IH60K|4.0|a very easy and fun solitaire game. Great for the mindless times when you doing two things at once to keep fingers busy.
1449417051|5.0|Awesome book, and a great author.  The Oatmeal is amazing!  Even got one for a gift.  The included fold out poster was a nice added bonus.
0763619612|5.0|This book is a must have for every teacher.  It is such a sweet book that teachers a wonderful lesson!!
B0019EXZY4|5.0|The item came quickly and it was in great shape. I'm happy with my order. I will be buying again.
B008X9Z3UC|1.0|I got this case as a gift, and it didn't fit my Kindle Fire HD 7\\". I'm used to tablet sleeves fitting extremely snugly, but the Kindle Fire HD 7\\" was too long and wide for the case.
B008ALAHA4|5.0|It does what it says it does.  A must have for anyone migrating to the new macbooks from the old ones.
B007CIQ4B2|5.0|Ben has some great work on this album. His lyrics are beautiful. I am so excited to see what else he will produce.
B00A8ECU24|4.0|Very cute.  My 3-year-old daughter and I play together and we both like it.  Very nice how they incorporate elements from the show!
B006LSZECO|5.0|Gone Girl is one hell of a multilayered, expertly written psychological thriller.  It dissects the breakup of Amy and Nick's marriage, from both their points of view at different times in their marriage.  They're both manipulative, deceitful, and vengeful, but when Amy goes missing, who's at fault and who is responsible?  Nick was so handsome and charming, but I hated him for being so weak and selfish, always taking the easy way.  (If there is growth for anyone, however, perhaps he does achieve it.)  Amy was beautiful and elegant, but she wasn't always what she seemed.<br /><br />Do yourself a favor and don't read any more ABOUT the book, go READ the book now!  You don't want to spoil all the twists and turns in store for you.  This is not a happy or even comfortable read, but it's a fascinating journey you can't stop.
B00005B1W7|5.0|A somewhat dated and stilted movie, but well worth the time. Gazzara is very good; Hopkins not so much. Love to see this re-made. It was one of - if not the - first &#34;mini-series&#34;, and the blank screens every few minutes (obvioulsly for commercial breaks) are a bit annoying.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I really liked this (these) game(s) becouse it creates a fun/challenging enviroment. Anyone who needs to pass time or is just bored get this game it's so so so awesome.
B007HACDLK|3.0|The read went along nicely then suddenly everything just cam to an abrupt ending. It's like the author ran out of time or paper.
B007GCY8FS|2.0|I'm done. These were great airplane/vacation reads, but Child is just phoning it in at this point. It is amazing to me that a writer with the resources that this franchise must command can't get some of the most basic firearms/Mil tech right. On top of it all Who signed off on Reacher a 6' 5&#34; - hands the size of dinner plates - rugged NOT handsome guy to be played by Tom Cruise.
B0063IH60K|5.0|lots of fun, I have always enjoyed this game and this edition is no different  I am glad to have it on my kindle
1451695187|5.0|Excellent book and good science to back up his claims. Proof as much as there can be proof for such a thing !
B008AK8FHM|5.0|Very interesting and good book.  I could have read it one sitting, I just didn't have enough time.  Once I started I wanted to read it all.  The author gave a good mix of medical-scientific information along with the other information.
B006SMLAMQ|1.0|unable to change locations.  Who needs to know the weather for a city 2500 miles away.  Do not purchase this app.
B007GCY8FS|4.0|i really enjoyed this book while reading it but can not recall many of it's contents. i prefer book that i can later discuss with my friends. however i do know it kept my interest because of the short time it took me to read it. i also know i will recommend it to others. so i will be reading it again.
B001BNFR6W|1.0|NBC should be ashamed of themselves. As EVERYONE has written, the whole set of DVDs is defective. Every single one of mine is defective. They are obviously cheaply made and poorly produced. If I didn't know better I would think they were bootleg or knock offs. If I could have given zero stars, I would have. There are also lots of cuts in the episodes ( the few that actually partially played). I hope NBC brings out a real complete boxed set , despite being burned by this I would still like to own a quality set.
B004S5FWEC|5.0|I have read later books about King and Maxwell and was alw3ays curious about how their story started.  It is a great yarn.  I am always keen to get back to it.  Can't wait for the finish-75% through at the moment.
B000HKW7E0|5.0|Christmas Vacation movie meets expectations of a Christmas movie to be enjoyed with friends and family gatherings for many years.
B00A7CI82I|5.0|Saw it in the theaters & couldnt get enough, Jeremy Renner was great, so talented! Racheal Weisz is amazing & beautiful!
B001D0DQUC|5.0|C'mon, It's Ferris Bueller, need I say more. The trip to the museum alone is worth the price of renting the movie.
B0067TQQI8|5.0|I ordered several Battery Chargers and was very happy with them all. Unfortunately one was slightly scratched on the back so I emailed and was assured that it would be dealt with to my satisfaction. They sent me a new one before I had even returned the original, trusting that I would return it, which I did of course! I placed a second order and I am pleased to say everyone is getting a battery charger in their stocking this year! (Survived \\"Sandy\\", but want to be better prepared next time)
B006SMLAMQ|1.0|this app was very good for 17 days, then I travelled and it ceased to show any data, and I could not add new cities. Thumbs down.
B001706I5I|5.0|Jim Carey gives a fantastic performance.  The whole family enjoyed the film. I recommend to anyone who likes a little slapstick comedy.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|If you are watching this you know it is great. If you are not watching, you should be. It is so much more than zombies, so if you are hung up on that one aspect get over it a watch.
