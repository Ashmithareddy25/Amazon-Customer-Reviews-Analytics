B00FAPF5U0|3.0|I have read the reviews, and I'm summing up what I read.<br /><br />THE GOOD<br /><br />Ok, everyone is happy it's finally here. The best candy match game EVER. The levels are fun and challenging, great for older kids and adults. The characters are adorable, and the game is completely addicting. Perfect for patent people who don't toss their electronics out the window when they get stuck. Awsomest game EVER!<br /><br />THE BAD<br /><br />For people without Facebook, this game can become unusable. For so many things you need your friends. Also, some of the reviews said that the game didn't download. I'm pretty sure it was a relief to them that this game was free. It ticks me off if I buy a game and it doesn't download.<br /><br />THE UGLY<br /><br />Seriously, King.com! You are totally getting Rich off this game! Past level 35 (as the reviews said) you gotta pay to play. You have to wait millions of hours until you have full lives, unless you pay. You Literally have to be rich and a fool with money to play this game without &quot;problems&quot; .  Also, some review said Candy Crush is like a lot of other games, that are completely free (except for some that you just have to pay to download) and just as challenging and cute. So, why are we all crowding around this one Candy puzzle game and not the others? And the reply &quot;Cause it's AWSOME!!!!&quot; Is not a answer. My guess is because they &quot;spruced up the looks and made the others look dopey&quot;. No Offense. But seriously, This game is a money vacuum. I recommend it to the rich, spoiled people of the world. Thanks for reading!
1451673442|3.0|This book and author did not resonate with me. The topic is important. Other books on the subject of gratitude and thanksgiving were better for me. BUT, other may get much more form it than I did.
B00ET9T2WK|5.0|This game is good for people who like action and fun. There are other games like this but this won is the best. #battlenations
B003EY7IUY|3.0|But otherwise uninspiring. The heroine, while endearing, makes not one step on the path of maturity. Rather she is rescued just as any vain incarnation of the modern female archetype would be by the real adults who enable her wanton spending and wasteful life.<br /><br />But it was a cute book. So if you want a cute, easy read filled with like-able people, you will love thus book
B00BD99JMW|4.0|I didn't think it was as well written as the others and I did not like the way it ended.
B00BATG18K|3.0|I am such an Amy Tan fan but like others have said, I found myself impatient through long stretches with detail that was redundant. It felt a little as if, after all the research had been done, all of it had to be folded into the book. I am guessing it is hard to know how to mesh information into historical fiction. I also enjoyed the early chapters where the style kept me in the moment with the characters.  I see where others have loved the book and I am glad. I have all of her books.
B00GHJ1S2M|1.0|I liked Gaga's first two albums, but this one the only song I like is Applause. So glad I didn't pay $9.99 for this album.
B00BAXFCPO|5.0|I took just enough chemistry to understand that our bodies are too complex to allow for tinkering with too many medications.  But that's just what the healthcare system in this country ends up doing with people.  Here is a rational, everyday dietary approach that frankly, many have promoted before.  But Permutter puts all the pieces together, showing why this alternative is worth sticking to.  I am less than three weeks into the diet, and my body is getting the hang of it. (I even felt the withdrawal cravings of carbs in week one, which I was more than happy to ignore, because the author prepares you for it.)  As an avid cyclist and whitewater kayaker, I was wondering where I'd make up the calories, but once the carb cravings are gone, you can easily enjoy more satisfying calories from fats and 'natural' protein than carbs and protein shakes.  This author has done a good job walking the reader through every aspect of the changeover.  That way, when someone pooh poohs my diet, I have an answer for them.
B00CDTSQZW|5.0|This show really surprised me. I was already interested in the plot, time period, etc. but I didn't expect it to be this good. The filming, acting, locations, and story are all done very well. The characters all have their own story and personality that pulls you in and make you either love or hate them. If you're a fan of vikings, norse mythology, battles, drama, etc. you should check out Vikings.
B000FBJG04|5.0|it brought out the feelings and the reactions of individuals within the book as well as a good history lesson on WWII.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Great Read...Just Grisham type fun. It's again one of those<br />books you can't put down because Grisham spins such a good<br />tale. Once again, a sub plot is racism in the ole South but<br />justice eventually triumphs.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|Like mario bros<br />We really like it, good for the whole family.<br />Very cool<br />I would like to know how many levels
B00C50NV2M|5.0|I really like these passive 3d glasses. While they are Sony brand, they work well with any passive 3d tv, such as my Vizio. These are very comfortable and lightweight, and most importantly for me, they work really well over glasses.  I tried a few others and really recommend these.
B00BWJARHO|5.0|Great movie! Well worth watching if you liked all of the others in the series. I dont want to spoil anything so Ill leave it at that.
B00FEHXCIG|4.0|Action, adventure, Who can ask for more. Make a bowl of popcorn and settle back with your family for a few hours of escapism.
B0040I09RM|2.0|soap opera... like anyone needs that?  I didnt care for soaps when my sister was glued to them and I had to watch. I dont care what you put the people in, a leather jacket and motorcycles even cant make that cool. Katy is always awesome though so she save me from giving it a one star!
B007QA3AH2|5.0|This is a fantastic tale of friends although you may not realize it at first.  It is a movie that I have watched time and again.
B00AAI7B7W|3.0|always wanted to see this but was never allowed. By the time I could it is cheesy! Didnt scare me at all but the kids I grew up with that did see it thought it was scary
B005ES0XVO|5.0|I've had trouble with my feet for the last 4-5 years.  Crocs have become the ONLY shoe I can wear.  And I've been wearing an old, hand-me-down pair of original Crocs for over a year.  I decided to UP my shoe game a bit on a new pair, and recently purchased the Croc Duet Sport.  These are so comfortable!  Much more comfortable than my old pair of Crocs.  The Duet Sport has a more durable sole, thicker/harder surfaced too so I don't feel every rock and bump in the road as I walk.  Very happy with these, and I'll be getting a second pair.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|&#34;Wool&#34; is a fascinating book---well written with good characters.  I thoroughly enjoyed it and am eagerly looking forward to the next book in the series.
B004U8VX2M|5.0|I live shows about his time period.  Appreciate the fact that there is no vulgarity even when addressing delicate issues.  And no horrible language
B000QCQ8Y4|5.0|Excellent story line and clear narrative as usual. Liked the aspect about taking care of old friends and involving old buddies!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Great book! I would definitely recommend this book to anyone. My fifth graders love this book. They keep passing it on.
B00EDR5N58|3.0|Records were a little warped.  Picture discs and colored vinyl like that are usually warped to some degree but this was a little more than I would of liked.  Still plays and sounds great but with the high price tag I might of thought twice about buying it if I knew it would of been that degree.  I've heard other people complain about this with this record as well.  Once it hits the music you can't really tell much but in the gaps it's pretty obvious.  Other than the everything in it was great.
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|I like this game, it is a lot better then the original castleville. It sucks to have big wait times, but I can deal. Thankfully we don't have to worry about energy.
B00GBCMW9S|5.0|took me two times to listen to the album and i love it....alot of great beats.....alil bit of slim and im glad to have more of his music
B000P0J09W|5.0|Wonderful movie that makes me wish I were a kid again!  Wonderful story!  Wonderful overdrawn characters!  One of my favorite movies.
B00EY8BRGU|5.0|Now You See Me<br />Surprise ending, great plot!! Really well done.  Hope they do a series of these!! We will watch it again.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|great story lines, acting is also good.  Characters change as their lives grow in the big house...it's very addictive when you get into the characters and their lives...
B007IXWL2C|4.0|The beginning was a little too &#34;hearts & flowers&#34; for me but once we got through the honeymoon it started to pick up.  Have to say that the ending when it switched to Christian was probably my favorite part of the whole story.  I would have loved to have seen more from his perspective.  True, the inner goddess monologue was really old after awhile but I just skimmed over that.  Have to say I'm sorry the book is done because I miss Christian already.
B004W1GCNC|5.0|acting is superb, characters may be rich Upstairs but not above the characters Downstairs.  Believable storytelling and constant great acting
B00A7YZ1KI|5.0|I loved the final book in this series, it was a little predictable, (with the ending in the last book), but was a great read as it wrapped everything up, for those of us who have followed Sookie's journey.
B002ZG976U|5.0|Christine and Cher were amazing! Great costumes and music. Definitely would purchase as a gift or for self. Very entertaining.
B00BPDR3F6|5.0|This is an awesome book.  While this is a fairly long read, the author keeps the story moving and it really only becomes fairly predictable as the book ends.  This is both an historical fiction novel set mostly in the 1800s, and an informative romp through early science via mosses.  It is also part philosophical, somewhat in the line of Gilbert's other well-known Eat, Pray, Love.  I love the message of this book and we need more messages in society like this to remind all of us about the wonderful knowledge that science has brought us, yet the failing of depending on reductionist science completely, whereby we forget to bring that knowledge back into focus as part of the whole system.  You cannot take ONE thing all by itself.  Everything is part of a greater system.
B00BAXFJ5M|4.0|I have wanted to read a novel by David Baldacci for longer than I can remember. He writes in the genre that I love and can't get enough of. Action-packed, espionage, unstoppable villains, and gripping plots are what I expect from writers such as Baldacci. Thankfully he doesn't disappoint with the latest in his Sean King and Michelle Maxwell series.<br /><br />King and Maxwell begins with a soldier, Sam Wingo, carrying a 4800 pounds of cargo across the desert of the Middle East. Wingo does not know what's in the cargo, but does know that it is precious, important, and a matter of life or death. Anything that comes with a kill-switch must be pretty important right? Instead of the mission going off as planned, a man named Tim Simons, claiming to be CIA, high-jacks the cargo by convincing Wingo plans have changed. Oh how plans have changed and Wingo is suddenly without recourse in a country that has no shortage of enemies.<br /><br />Enter Sean King and Michelle Maxwell, driving along on a rainy night, are interrupted during a back and forth by a teenage boy running across the street yeidling a gun. Before King can stop the recovering Maxwell from fleeing the car, she dashs out in search of the teenager ignoring the pain in her body that tells her to stop running. She's been in recovery from a knife in the back wound and is still not 100%, although she pretends to be for King's sake. Eventually Maxwell catches up to the boy and introduces herself as one half of the Private Investigating team that is King and Maxwell.<br /><br />Because of Maxwell's own childhood issues, she's drawn to Tyler Wingo once the circumstances of his running away come to light. Tyler has reason to believe that his father is alive although the military says that he isn't. He enlists the help of Maxwell. King is most relunctant to take on the case because there are too many red flags suggesting they should back off. Red flags that tote guns and will kill mercilessly. Eventually, the four characters involved uncover an ingenious plot of revenge.<br /><br />King and Maxwell is one of those books where if you blink, you may just miss something. Baldacci keeps his foot on the gas the entire time. The pages are laced with action sequences, witty banter, and non-stop intrigue. I very much like novels that read like an action movie. But that too can get draining for someone who's in search of some higher meaning or great literary masterpiece. That's not what this type of book is about! Look elsewhere if you want to be bored to death!<br /><br />Although I very much like reading books that don't describe tree bark for a whole chapter, I do expext a little more depth to the characters than was given. I'm not lost on the fact that this is not the first in a series, but is the first of the series I've read. My problem wasn't with our starring duo King and Maxwell, who are actually pretty well fleshed out. My gripe is with the people they encounter. Tyler and Sam Wingo are the average run of the mill teenager and soldier for hire. They had no real depth to them to keep me rooting for them one way or another. Although the bad guys plan is something I'd never have guessed, his reasons revenge were vague to me. I wish Baldacci had expanded a little more on that aspect.<br /><br />As mentioned earlier, this is my first adventure with David Baldacci, but certainly won't be my last. He's a best-selling author for obvious reasons. King and Maxwell will certainly appeal to fans of action thrillers as well as die-hard Baldacci fans. I look forward to reading more by Baldacci. ****<br /><br />Copy provided by Netgalleyrs involved uncover an ingenious plot of revenge.<br /><br />King and Maxwell is one of those books where if you blink, you may just miss something.

B007U1FEJE|5.0|I just finished listening to the single, &#34;That's Why God Made The Radio.&#34; It was the first time I'd ever heard the song and I could not believe the SOUND I was hearing! Brian Wilson, Mike Love, Al Jardine, David Marks, and Bruce Johnston are around 70 yrs old now, except David Marks who is my age, 65. And their voices were so unbelievable in this song that I had to call my wife into the room to listen and get her reaction to it. She was amazed, too. In fact, her response was, &#34;They sound like they did when they were in their 20's.&#34; And that is NOT an exaggeration! That these guys still have this sound, this range, and this strength of voice at the age they are at now, borders on the miraculous. If you haven't heard it, you've got to listen and find out for yourself.<br /><br />The Beach Boys have always been my favorite group and always will be. I never got swept away with the tide of Beatlemania like so many did. The Beach Boys' distinctive sound and legendary harmony were unlike any other group I had ever heard and they captivated me like no other group ever has. Obviously, this is just my opinion out of countless others whom I know would disagree, but to me, the early Beach Boys and the early Four Seasons were (in that order) the best harmony groups ever.
B00FEMJF6O|4.0|I may have just spent the past hour playing this game. Plus who doesn't want a pet dragon that searches  for treasure.
B000OJFV4C|1.0|Worse than a soap opera. Hokey and pretentious. It purports to be a historical drama, but clearly is only interested in the salacious bits, which might have been fine if it didn't compress major events into 30 minutes of plot, scattered between terrible romance.
B008KNUKVI|5.0|If you did not have all 5 of them just the way they are, it would not be as good.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|greatest thing i've ever had and it's cheap too. the only downside is you have to plug it into the wall too. you also have to have a wireless router for it to work but you probably have one anyways if you're trying to buy it.
B005COO1X6|3.0|Too short and seems not to take itself seriously, but it was an entertaining read. Something simple made creepy by the master.
B00B7Y0206|1.0|was working perfectly up until two or so weeks ago... I'm not sure what caused the problem, but now I can't have the app open for even 5 minutes before it crashes. forget about playing videos. this is my favorite youtube app, so I hope an update comes out soon that will fix this. Till then, one star.
B0012CH350|4.0|Bought this for my mother's Weber grill and she really likes it. Keeps her grill clean and out of the weather.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|Loved it....shows great compassion, strength of charcter. Beautiful love story. Some humor.Think this is a &#34;ladies &#34; book. Read IT.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I love the book it has a great story and how the author gets me so sucked in to reading this great book
B008GWOVB8|5.0|This movie is one of my all time favorites! The cast meshes well together and it doesnt matter how old you get its still awesome to watch!
B00BD99JMW|3.0|Overall good book, but not nearly as amazing as divergent and insurgent.  This book seemed to rely more on the nature verse nurture issue than on the interactions between characters. There could have been more development between characters.
B000EHSVQ4|5.0|I always thought the movie was sort of ho-hum. Until I saw the director's cut. It's quite spectacular and the characters are much, much more developed which makes the character's motivations and actions a lot more credible.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|It's hard to criticize this series.  It is so well casted that one can hardly think of those actors outside of the characters they portray. Superb acting by Shirley McLaine. It gives you a chuckle to see her giving the American perspective over the English traditions.  Superb!
B001TKD4ZI|5.0|it was a really good book. it looked interesting. kept my attention. probably recommend it to friends to read it.
B00992CF6W|2.0|ok soo i bought this app since im obsesed with minecraft and at first it work perfectly untill like 1 month later i was playing in creative when i placed a sign. and when i placed the sign my screen FROZE! and not a sec. later my kindle shut down (i have a kindlefire hd) soo i press my on button thinkin it needs to be charged soo i keep pressing it till 10 min. later it turns on and it still had lots of battery power. i just wanted to say that so it can be fixed and its not my kindle cause i only had my kindle for 3 months now its still practically bran new!!!! soo its a glitch in tye game i hope it will be fixed cause i love the game except for that glitch. i thank whoever can fix the glitch. thank u.
B008LXZEYU|4.0|I really hated Will Ferrell for a very long time and refused to watch his movies. Then our daughter kept trying to get us to watch this with her so we gave in so she wouldn't feel bad. Well, I have to say I don't think I've laughed quite so hard as I did at this movie. Will Ferrell totally redeemed himself to me after my first experience with him, which was \\"Elf\\", and which I hated tremendously. It's probably because I didn't grok (\\"get\\") Will Ferrell's humor, but now that I do, I've watched a bunch of his movies and will probably try Elf again. There is some outrageously dark comedy in this movie. Wear your Depends.<br /><br />Jerry Boutot<br />[...]
B00AZ7V0W0|3.0|It's ok because it doesn't have any special about it. Nice to have the full package though. Great collection, not an 'amazing' one, but it's ok.!
B00G32TD98|4.0|This movie was good and had some scary scenes in it. But overall, for a movie based on a true story, the excessive use of FX and CGI made it a bit on the unrealistic side. I would have kept it more down to earth and used subtlety. I'm pretty sure that most of the experiences depicted in the movie did not happen quite so blatantly. Paranormal experiences are, after all, hallucinations that take place in the visual and auditory receptors in the brain (which is why it's almost 100% impossible to take a picture).<br /><br />Jerry Boutot<br />[...]
B008Y5T5ZE|1.0|Johnny Depp was the only good thing about this show. The plot had potential, but the other actors missed the mark.
B008Y7N7JW|1.0|Star Wars for Quakers.  Maybe for some; but I am not much in favor of politically-correct heroes.  Conan the Barbarian doesn't care who is offended.
B006BGZJJ4|3.0|Not much to rate, it works, doing what it was designed for.  But it cost way to much.  Especially since Wally World (Wal-mart) has the same thing for half the price.  I should have checked there first.
B000SO7OL6|5.0|Diana Krall's best, her very best. Each song sounds better as they tick off throughout the CD bringing her music and sounds right into your living room.
B003UESJF6|5.0|I'm not sure why, but this is the movie we watch the most when we're all together (three generations).  It appeals to all of us.
B00BD99JMW|2.0|I finished this book at 10:30 pm and was so distraught at the ending that I couldn't sleep.  I feel like the characters at the end of the book deserved hope that they could rebuild a new world after discovering all the deceit and lies that they were living in.  But nooooo, the author has to go off on a selfless tangent and kill off THE main character.<br /><br />I did read V Roth's explanation on her blog as to why Tris had to die, but I don't think this whole self sacrificing story line had to go that far. Tris proved herself in her ability to go above and beyond selflessness for the people she loved. So it doesn't make sense why VR couldn't save her. When her mom comes to her and Tris asks if she's done, her mom could have said, &#34;No, there's so much more left to do&#34; .. like .. rebuilding society, having a more normal life, and continuing her relationship with Tobias.<br /><br />Would it have been so difficult for VR to write that the death serum had an preserving affect on Tris because she was Divergent? Yeah, I know that being Divergent isn't some magical property, but if that wasn't the case, couldn't someone (anyone!) reach Tris and save her?<br /><br />I guess I became too emotionally invested in this story. I hope a book won't affect me like that again.
B00000IQW5|5.0|We have loved this movie forever, and were happy to find it on Amazon.  Holly Hunter and John Goodman at their best.  Our favorite quote: &#34;I can't be with him! He looks like I won him in a raffle!&#34; : )
B00BD99JMW|3.0|I'm almost disappointed in the way it ended. It felt rushed and the beginning slow. Took my 4 times as long to finish it unlike the first 2.I just had to know how it eneded
B0042U94UQ|5.0|This is our second favorite movie when we are all together (three generations).  We watch it over and over...and over.
B00FAPF5U0|2.0|While this game is challenging, it is difficult to play and in order to get anywhere in the game at a faster pace, one has to pay for the privledge. Feel like this would be a big waste of money and is a rip off.
0679809015|5.0|My granddaughter loved this book at our house so much I wanted to buy her her own.  Babies 6 months and up, and toddlers too, want to read this book over and over.
0743270754|5.0|Doris Kearns Goodwin brings Abraham Lincoln to life once again. Her analysis of the times and personalities surrounding Lincoln during those turbulent times is fascinating.
B007SSDBBM|5.0|One of our favorite movies.  I bought this copy to send to my mom, who'd never seen it.  She liked the contrast with how men treat women now compared to how they treated them &#34;in her day&#34;.
0375842209|5.0|What can you say about a book that makes the Grim Reaper seem like such a friend? Markus Zusak gives life to Death and many valiant characters who choose to do good in horrific times.
B005J3IEZQ|4.0|Changed my view of Apple products.  An eye opener into the world of Steve Jobs and the hurdles that he and those around him faced.  Superbly written.
0142501123|5.0|Such a cute book! Our 7 year old grandson read this to his grandpa. The two of them were giggling and laughing throughout the book. The artwork is delightful. We love finding books that he likes to read. This definitely a great buy!
B002RI9ZQ8|5.0|Brilliant plot and written in a style that paints the picture in your mind so easily. It evokes all the emotions.  I couldn't wait to start his second book.
0142405809|5.0|How sweet! Our 7 year old grandson loved this book. Before we could read it together, he had read it on his own! It's a wonderful little story, perfect for young readers. The artwork is great as well! This is a great buy!
B00FXMECS6|3.0|I liked the action but it did drag in parts of the movie I cant wait until they make a red 3
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Love love this game I finally gave in and got the game, at first I kept saying why all this fuss about a game. Now I know why lol .
B000GWE44U|1.0|I'm sure I would have enjoyed the movie a lot more if I WAS ABLE TO WATCH IT! It needed to load after every 5 seconds of playing and when I tried it on my other computer, all it said was &#34;we can't play it back bla bla bla&#34; Other videos work fine so its not my internet. Very frustrating &#62;:-(
1451666179|5.0|I absolutely loved this book. I had been reading the blog Hyperbole and a Half for a few years and this book is more of the same type of stories. There are a few repeat stories from the blog, but they are ones I love to read again and again (Motivation, Testing Dog's Intelligence, etc.). I heartily recommend this book!
B006LSZECO|1.0|I hated the plot. All the major characters were unlikeable and  the only reason I finished the book was because I was hoping the ending would justify the time i spent reading it. Disappointed.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|keeps you interested and wanting to read more, easy to read the people come to life you picture what is happening
B006PZBRCY|4.0|It's prettry violent with the robots fighting.  The theme/plot/story line reminded me a lot of Rocky IV.  I don't think  I need to see it again.
B0055MI8K2|2.0|I have never had sandals smell this bad. I guess this was made before they introduced Microban in to their products. They were also too big.
006202406X|1.0|This was a terrible book.  It was illogical and badly written and, worst of all, the ending sucked.  I can handle sad books.  I've read 1984 two or three times, and it's one of my favorite books, but her death was truly pointless and awful.  And how was it self less?  Tobias was the one who needed her.  If she had been acting in anyway selflessly, she would have stuck around for his sake, just so he would have someone besides his awful parents. Caleb certainly didn't need her, and the book would have been a lot better if had made amends for betraying Tris.  I felt awful after reading this book.  I felt heart broken for Tobias and so depressed.  It's like the author just wanted to remind us how awful this world is- the good dies, nothing ever works out, and evil continues on.  Most of the terrible characters live on, like Marcus and Peter. I honestly wish I had never read this book.  I can't get rid of the terrible feeling of hopelessness it left me with.  The first two books were so good.  I wish the author would rewrite the third.
B00F8GYC1Y|5.0|My grandson (7) is entertained with this game more than others, and my other grandson (3) enjoys this game just as much.  How did we keep them amused before now?

B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This game is so fun and its also challenging. I love games that are hard, but not to hard!<br />You need to get this game
B00F87ZUYG|4.0|So far an excellent season.  The characters remain engaging and hidden depths are being revealed.  George Romero criticized &#34;The Walking Dead&#34; as &#34;a soap opera with an occasion zombie&#34; but I will be bold enough to disagree.  I think The Walking Dead is a character study with an occasional zombie.  The zombie apocalypse serves to place human beings in the most extreme of circumstances and the fascination with The Walking Dead is to see how the characters evolve, for better or for worse.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|This is great for personalized alarms. I'm a college student and find this to be very useful. You can set multiple alarms and have a note for each alarm. I especially like how you can set your favorite song as the alarm.
B00B5HQLMI|5.0|Never have I found a bad Bond movie, they are entertaining for the what they are, entertainment. This one has a great story, great acting, great everything.
B00FPH6AXE|2.0|Boring one dimensional story with no real characters of interest  Really wish Will Smith could find a decent script this  was just not that interesting.
B009G41CG2|5.0|Play this on my kindle every night! Addicting. Wish it would move to a different game sequence when you finish one but oh well.
B007EECSFA|5.0|Kate Morton is a wonderful author. The author has given her story the usual twists and turns. As with her other books, you don't want to put it down. Our book club is going to have it on our list of reads this year. Beautiful story.
B005MMY9A8|5.0|Loved the movie and loved the quality and subtitles feature. Whole family could watch it. The streaming was perfect as well.
B005LAJ17M|5.0|A gripping storyline with many twists and turns.  Watched the whole 1st season in two days.<br />The best drama series since Shogun.
B00129H7VS|5.0|Best WWII Anything....In my opinion. Actually got my girlfriend to watch this, and she does not like war movies or shows. When one DVD ended she asked.....can we watch another. Saving private Ryan is the only other movie that comes close. I like this due to you get to know the people behind the Airborne.
B009LDCZDC|5.0|Outstanding drama series.  Had to hurry and watched the complete 2nd season so I could start watching the third season live.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Fun<br />Addicting<br />Waste time
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|This is an inexpensive TV device.<br />It is not a Roku or Apple TV -- its a bit more limited.<br />You can &#34;throw&#34; videos from your iPhone or Android or PC.<br />This works well for Youtube & Netflix apps -- you have to work-around for getting Plex, etc streamed.<br />The Chrome browser extension will send a tab to the TV - so thats what you have to use for the other videos.<br /><br />I hope Google opens up the development ... else, its simply OK for the price.
B004SBQGHS|5.0|My whole family loves playing this app! Tons of fun and can get addictive. I recommend it to everyone! LOL.
1439170916|5.0|This is a very good explanation of the history of the medical cancer response.<br />That is: the story of cancer and chemotherapy.<br /><br />Its well written. As a researcher in my work life (different field), this was FASCINATING.<br />Of course, I have a pony in this race -- so I'm chasing the topic to understand my own situation.<br />This book was VERY helpful to overview the domain.
0316010669|5.0|A great read.  Lots of inteesting stories and, even though they don't all seem to relate to the overall theme, I learned from each of them.
B00AZMFJYA|4.0|Above average Star Trek movie.  Some scenes were predictable.  The young Kirk, Spock and Bones continue to do an admirable job as &#34;close&#34; crew members.
B00G4SS24I|3.0|There are a few really catchy, stand-out tracks that have a great fusion of club music and 80's pop, but unfortunately, too many of the tracks feel uninspired and just kinda strange (the title track, for example).  No album is perfect, but was hoping for a lot more greatness in the vein of 'Lost In My Bedroom', 'Everything's Embarrassing', and 'You're Not the One', but sadly, there are more duds here than hits.
B005O7Q6FM|5.0|Clever story lines and continuous tension between the the two leads makes nearly every episode fun to watch. This is done without special effects or implausible science fiction and humor.
B001O80G60|5.0|Freakin' phenominal!!! I love every track.Being a huge fan of bands like Kreator,exodus,overkill and the like.Pantera wasn't a huge departure from that but it was different.Cowboys was fantastic but Vulgar (for me) was perfection.Theres nothing negative about this album.From start to finish the songs a great and the groove is so intense!!!I'd recommend this for any fan of heavy music in a heartbeat.
B000SGSU58|4.0|The trial was dull and for a while there wasn't anything else.  But things picked up after a while and the trial added excitement by acting like a chain around Bosch's ankle.  But chain or not, Bosch comes through and saves the day and his trial by showing that serial rapist was really two men. Well worth reading.<br /><br />Richard Ruppel
B001O7Y8FQ|5.0|Cant find 1 negative on this disc.I would recommend it to anyone interested in checking out heavy metal for the 1st time. Its the album that began the bands ascent to the top of the mountain.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I am speechless.....tricking amazing. Just so good all the way<br />Through the book. You simply cannot put it down. Word
B0034BMQ9A|4.0|this album in my opinion rocketed the guys to the next level.Not doing anything they hadn't done on previous efforts but the songs are just better.This was their first effort I liked from start to finish.I still cant put it in the same league as Helloween's keeper II but I believe Visions to be the 1st album in a string of great albums for stratovarius.After hearing it I definitely checked out other stuff from their catalogue.And along with destiny and infinite it fits perfectly.If your a fan of power metal Visions would be an album you check out
B0019FOC5E|5.0|I bought this for my girlfriend to replace the one her car radio ate. We went to see this together and love all the songs.
B00003CXAA|5.0|You can't go wrong with this collection, no matter which of the movies you choose to watch!  What a series!
B0091VYG86|1.0|if Zero stars were ava.. I would give it that.<br />The Plot is really out there... the acting ok, cinematography effects acceptable<br />But the msg is horrible....<br />It is a movie that leaves with a bad taste in your mouth....<br />It is boring, and truly reflects the decay in our society.<br />very disappointing to see Tobey Maguire in this movie... and to tell the truth his character is lousy... can of makes his smile which I enjoyed so much in the past like a &#34;Iknow it all&#34; ...<br />This movie that the sex revolution which has destroyed this country, families and the fabric of our society, is the golden key to happiness.... It does nt bring color to your life... LOVE does.. , sex is a wonderful gift not a trashy tool
0451167716|5.0|Amazing.  It gave a lot more back story than the movie, and brought a lot of the movie into a deeper perspective.
B000ZN8036|5.0|This movie hit very close to home.  I recommend it, but be aware...depending on your previous experience, it could rip your heart out.
0307277887|5.0|I was amazed how closely season one followed the novel.  There are only minor differences, but each--the show and the book--are amazing!  I was upset when it ended...because it ended!
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Another great book I am a big fan of his and can hardly wait when he writes new books!  Loved it
B00G4PX1MO|2.0|This is the hardest TD I've ever played. Seriously, the jungle is impossible and sometimes enemies come out of a lake or random tree in the middle of the course. Fun but SO MUCH BULLS***.
B00CN3U8TA|5.0|Wow I have been waiting for this figure and it did not disappoint at all. The face sculpt is unbelievable. He looks just like Chris Hemsworth (and for a fraction of the price that HotToys charge!!!)!!!! I got it when it first came out so I only paid $20 not including taxes. This figure is even better than the Ironman 3 Mark 42 figure as the likeness is even better. Paint apps is also very good (better that the Mark 42) and I am digging the sleeveless look. He is also very poseable and stands easy in all poses and the joints are not as loose as on the Ironman figure). A must get for Thor fans. My only grip is that his arms are on the skinny side. Now if they would do another Diamond Select Loki, I would totally get him....
B009XIXVU6|4.0|It is an engrossing read!  Up to the standard set by The Kite Runner.  A bit confusing at times, but worth the extra effort of concentration it takes to untangle the various sub-stories and characters.  A really good insight into life in Afghanistan.
B00FVVR2ZO|5.0|I used to bypass hidden object games however I am SO glad that I gave this game a try! I really enjoy the quests and the fact that when an object is needed I can click the &quot;find&quot; button and it will direct me to the location or &quot;person&quot; that I can obtain it from! I am not a fan of having to purchase objects to be able to play a game and even though this game has in app purchasing I can play longer and get further in the game even if I am unable to purchase items!
B002PQ7JQK|5.0|The original series with some interesting bonus features.  The only problem I had is that it didn't remember which episode I left off on if I didn't watch a whole disc at one session.<br /><br />It still has the thing that made the original series great: stories.  TNG and the other spin-offs had cooler effects and props, but the stories were not as good as the first two seasons of TOS.  The third season you can tell that Gene was less involved and was just trying to cash out.  He was frustrated with NBC and the studio and it shows.  This was the first American TV show that actually took Sci-Fi seriously and didn't treat it as ridiculous &#34;theatre of the absurd&#34;.  Everything that came after owes a huge debt to Gene and the hundreds of people who made Trek.  That's why I've been a loyal fan since I was old enough to watch TV.
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|Finally the ending I've been waiting for. Such a great finish to a good long series. It was well worth the wait.
B00FEMJF6O|4.0|So far this is a great game. I just started playing so we will see.  It is pretty straight forward. I do wish there was more storage space to start with. I seem to fill up the vault pretty quickly
B00F3VOL38|5.0|It's The Beatles, duh! Lots of fun to listen to the group playing live without all the screaming. What talent!
B005LAII44|4.0|I do like this movie its good fighting movie and I do want to know that did is any other G.I. Joe coming.
B00F91SCXC|4.0|I'm not usually a &#34;scary movie&#34; person, but I enjoyed the suspense and action in this movie.  It was more &#34;Outbreak&#34; than &#34;Night of the Living Dead,&#34; which I liked.  The zombies were scary and believable, but gratuitous gore wasn't the point of the movie.  I thought all of the actors did a good job, and the story kept me interested all the way to the end.  I did not read the book, so I can't compare them.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|I totally fell in love with the setting and the characters.  What a powerful and intense story!  Hopefully Death is as kind as he seems.
B0053EZXRS|3.0|I love the action, however I did not like the nudity and sex scenes in it, along with the language.
B008133MDK|5.0|Thoroughly enjoyed the entire series. Being a fan of Sherlock Holmes I was facinated by another version. Writing, acting , filming, directing - all was extremly well done. It should have lasted longer than 2 seasons.
B00FAX6XQC|4.0|awesome game fun and challenging lags sometimes but its good for free I will continue to play a lot. blab blab blab
B00B0LPWU6|5.0|All of the actors were superb, the story line burst out the starting gate and kept my attention throughout the movie. This one will be a repeat watch over and over.
B006LG7O38|4.0|Different take on the original 'Fright Night', which I loved.  The casting of Collin Farrel was masterful, as he made the main vampire his own, hip, buff and sexy.  The Vegas location gave it an entirely different feel.  The fear and 'gotcha's' were retained but with better special effects.
0812981448|5.0|Finally a business approach I can live with. I found the book very inspiring and a breath of fresh air in the dog eat dog world of American corporations. If we all follow these principles the world will be a much better place.
B00B5HQLMI|4.0|Another fine, big hit for the Bond franchise, with Daniel Craig proving again that, after Sean Connery, he's the best Bond in film.
B000SO7OL6|5.0|Terrific album, with a lot of the songs played on Web-radio sites. A must have for Krall fans or new listeners.
B002O1Z4H2|5.0|Vin Diesel's introduction to most of us.  A wonderfully different sci-fi/creature feature.  This is one of those fils that make you watch it over and over.  Also introduced the sexy Radha Mitchell and my favorite alien from Farscape, Claudia Black.  Cole Hauser and Vin added the muscle and the eery three-sunned planet that became 'pitch black' added the scary ambiance. Lotta great 'gotcha' moments.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|This book can stand alone as a great read, but as a sequel to The Shining it is a fine continuation of one of the scariest books I ever read (and I don't scare easily). I love the explanation of what Danny became after his horrible experiences in the Overlook. It seems so real and logical a transition for him after such a traumatic event. And the to have to live with his gift (curse).  Stephen King has such s grasp of the human mind and soul. I plan to live to be 110 so Stephen should live at least that long to continue to feed my imagination!
B009CPJHY4|5.0|best movie I have ever seen about the coming of age of the other end of the life spectrum and how each of us handle it from the wisdom learned along the way to this courageous point in one's life.  It can be a new beginning and not an ending and it can be all that you want to do that you could not do growing up. Its limitless because what matters to others does not matter anymore.
0783233477|5.0|One of my favorite Brad Pitt movies. Touching, funny, serious all in one entertaining movies to watch over & over again.
B00FJU1HLC|3.0|My daughter thought this movie was alright, but I was pretty bored with it. Had hoped it would be better!
B008DYZKQE|5.0|My four year old didn't like this the first time we read it, but now she asks for me to read it to her!  It is different from the &#34;they lived happily ever after&#34; story, but I love teaching her she shouldn't accept being treated badly... even by her Prince!
B00FAI2IUM|5.0|Just got this the other day. Long download with almost 1gb of space. Plays as stated. You can purchase race related items on this app. Not a big fan of that. All in all a nice race game! Would recommend.
B00EMJD6TC|3.0|Movie was not very good.  You couldn't get into the characters and found it a little boring.  I thought &#34;I am Legend&#34; with Will Smith a better zombie movie.
B0067RQYNW|5.0|Great app. Now I can edit all of my word documents on my Kindle HD tablet. Works great and have had no major issues since the install. Highly recommend to anyone. This is one program you will use and be glad you have.
B002WW3J20|1.0|the dvd doesnt play, very disappointed, wish i wasnt lied to. what a waste of my time and money. never buying from this seller again
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|This game is addicting and so much fun! Ive stayed up until the early hours of the morning playing this game!AWESOMENESS!!!!!!!
B00GFOIUVQ|3.0|Only problems are the timers for the allies recovery time and to fight in the arena. They keep festering and never run out. I have completed all four worlds and have almost every star, except the ones I need the damn allies for that I can't get back in the game. Can something be done about this? If not then continuing to play is pointless<br />I would give the game 5 stars if it wasn't for this stupid glitch.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I read all three of Suzanne Collins's books of the Hunger Games Trilogy on a friends recommendation and enjoyed them all. The bleak hopeless life in the districts is amplified in Catching Fire. I saw the Hunger Games in its film incarnation before reading any of the books and was truly moved by the movie. I had heard that Jennifer Lawrence gave a fantastic performance. I do concur. There is a spare quality to Suzanne Collins's writing leaving most all coloring of the scene to the reader. I admire her work and feel her character's anguish as it is presented in her writing. The story is so terribly violent and manipulative and worst of all... possible. I think this is a must read for young readers,<br />AND THEN Go to see the films! They are stunning productions filled with images that will startle you to tears.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Love it!! Enjoy playing Bingo although the tournament are quite unrealistic you can never place first how Nan certain people score so high when it's not possible
B005LCYR7Y|5.0|Hard to put down. Easy to read. Just loved it. Good to be reminded of the good things and bad things of the times. SK in great form.
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|Great game!  It is super easy to play and hours of fun for me and many of my close friends.
B00DAPOHU6|5.0|Love Jack Johnson's voice --- so soothing.  His songs tell a story and keep the listener engaged. He draws you away into a calm, tranquil &#34;other life&#34;.
B00DJFIMW6|1.0|Game hasn't updated on kindle fire but it did on my phone I'm about to delete this game!!! Why is it like this?
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|The device works great. The HDMI extender included with the product helps with internet signal but the device can have signal issues if your TV's HDMI connection is located in an area of your TV that is covered by wires. This is an easy fix with a longer HDMI extension cord so that you can move the device to the top of the rear of the TV to gain better signal.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This book was good, beyond good actually. in this novel John Green re invents the young adult romance with his quirky an sensible style of telling  the almost true of  Hazel Grace and Augustus waters. It is a compelling read that I sprang many a hour trying to decipher the meaning of greens,masterwork he frankincense heartbreak with triumph. I would recommend this bestseller to any who are interested in young adult romance and of green himself as I was. Overall rating five out of five.
B000OJFV4C|5.0|Love it the second time I watched it as much as I did the first!<br />Love JRM!!!<br />I never get tired of watching it!
B00B0LPWU6|5.0|I thought this was one of Denzel's best performances. He brings to life all of humanities good and bad.<br />I enjoy movies that take me through those different levels of emotions.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Obsessively playing this! I imagine this would be a great way to keep younger children occupied on long car drives!
B002IY5DL2|5.0|How could I not like the original soundtrack for this outstanding and iconic film? There is one or two songs I'm not so keen on, but Simon & Garfunkel were at the top of their form.
1476712042|4.0|I hesitated to read this book but finally decided to give in and give it a shot.  Boy ... am I glad that I decided to read this.  From the first chapter to the last, I was hooked on this book.  Remember your first real love?  The person that you absolutely cannot get enough of?  The person you eat, sleep, dream, breathe, constantly think about?  The person that you're obsessed with and spend every waking minute of your time with?  That's the premise of this book and how I treated this book.  I could not put this book down.
B00DYEN5QU|1.0|The very worst Superman film I've ever seen and that includes Superman 4. There is virtually no story and no chemistry between Lois and Superman. This film was made for idiot teenage boys who like to see things blown up on screen. The 3D is disappointingly unimaginative, too. Wait for it to be offered used. I'm sure you'll have plenty of $5 copies to chose from.
0316322407|5.0|A movng insight into a very courageous and spirited young girl and into the problems facing her homeland. There is no doubt we will hear  more about Malala in the future as she fights for equal rights for women and greater freedom in Parkistan. This book makes you appreciate  and cherish what we have in  western countries. There is alot we can learn from Malala and her family.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|If you are at all interested in consciousness, I recommend reading this.  I really appreciate the tone of humility and vulnerability Eben tells his story with.
B004XZR63M|5.0|I have to say that this book teaches a hard lesson that I never learned. The idea that my home is a liability makes so much sense. However, I feel that there was a piece a information lacking. Should someone wait until they are out of debt before investing? How do I afford getting good attorneys so that I can invest wisely and legally?<br /><br />Then again, maybe that is the point to his book. Think about these questions and then try to answer them by using our own minds and situations. Really liked this book. I also recommend Dave Ramsey's books too.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Can't seem to put it down except when I run out of lives!<br />Now if they could only get the Yeti store back?
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I love Downton Abbey and I can watch it during my lunch hour it's great.  This season change everything at Downton. Love it!
B005V5WBFG|4.0|I was glad I was able to get protection for my new kindle. The nice thing is it is not costing me anything and I don't have to worry about a virus.
B00B0LPWU6|5.0|We were rooting for Denzel's troubled character the entire time, and a good movie will make you feel things you morally shouldn't.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|Can't wait for the next book!  He is a master storyteller. Totally engrossing from the beginning to the end, and leaves you hungry for the next installment.
B000A1SZ2Y|4.0|Fun and easy to use. Magnification varies depending on zoom, and lens you attach it to.  Essentially it's like clipping a magnifying lens to your camera lens.  It's a poor mans macro lens. Not perfect, but makes for some interesting shots.
B00AYB0TOW|5.0|An absolute must watch. I had never thought about watching this movie until I saw it as a top twenty must watch on amazon by reddit, but this movie is highly underrated. I hope its not just because I am drunk, but this movie is amazing!!!!
B00EYPGNQM|5.0|Intense from beginning to end. Spartacus last season met my expectations. I was afraid the end will result in a happier ending like most stories do but this show had it right by sticking to the true drama and consequences of a bloody war during historic imperial Rome.
B00B5HQLMI|5.0|Who doesn't love Bond? I love the story in this and Javier Bordem makes an amazing villain. Daniel Craig is always good looking.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|It was a heart felt story and I could not put it down. My book club picked this book and we will meet tonite to discuss it.
B007R11DKQ|5.0|I love this show. I was so happy to see it on Amazon. It's a cute little story and I love all the characters.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|This video was very good quality. Streaming is the way to go for convenience and ease of use. Can't beat it.
B0027CNFR4|5.0|I absolutely LOOOOVE this movie and cannot understand why the first one isn't available!! Please put the first Bridget Jones on!! This is so painfully hilarious to watch this woman that bad things just happen to. I've read they're probably going to make a third movie after the third book. We're in for a tear-jerker.
B002K2A74A|3.0|The good news-this is another fascinating look at Spencer Tunick's projects. It's always interesting to see how he puts them together, all the happy and willing participants and the cooperation he gets.<br />The bad news- according to the description this DVD was supposed to have English subtitles. If so I cannot find them and I'm used to turning them on as we many foreign movies that use them. The very brief menu does not offer them. Oddly, the only time there are subtitles is when he or his assistants are speaking in English and we get Spanish subtitles.<br />So the movie is interesting, you get the general drift of what's going on, but all the commentary and interviews are in Spanish. I'm wondering if in their mind they were using subtitles when English was spoken-I don't know.<br />With subtitles it would have gotten 5 stars.
B005PK1G76|5.0|Affordable and holds all the small items I need to take my baby for a walk. Perfect! I love it!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Great game, but they need to give more lives.  Guess I need to shoot my friend that got me into this game because I can't put it down.
B00ECUARO8|5.0|EEEEEExcelent movie. Matthew McConaughey has really turned into an incredible actor. I love his likeable personality. You alway want him to win.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|A very challenging and fun game. This game has very attractive graphics and the game is not too so difficult as to be frustrating.
B00FB029IU|4.0|I'm 53 years-old, (so I should be a real prude), but I find Jake Bugg to be the real deal.  This 19 year-old has got it going for him, he seems to know real musical history.  This his 2nd release \\"Shangri La\\", is full of great songs and excellent guitar playing by Jake.  To me this has that 70's singer songwriter feel too it, I find Jake's guitar playing a little like early Neil Young in spots.  Great tunes in \\"All Your Reasons\\", \\"Storm Passes By\\", \\"What Doesn't Kill You\\", \\"Simple Pleasures\\", \\"Kitchen Table\\", \\"Kingpin\\", \\"Messed Up Kids\\", \\"There's A Beast And We Feed It\\", and a classic in the making (maybe) \\"Slumville Sunrise\\".  Jake Bugg has it going for him right now, keep doing what your doing kid.  Nice production work by Rick Rubin.  **** 1/2.
B0041KBWM0|5.0|Romola Garai is absolutely precious as 'Emma Woodhouse'. Johnny Lee Miller is perfect as Mr. Knightley. I appreciate the quality of BBC actors, the care they take with sets, costumes, and dialouge. Love this version. Highly recommend. Thanks!
B0036OS3FG|4.0|light weight , keeps feet warm , would recommend to a friend,  water proof  and  i like them very much
B008NW67E0|5.0|Love this Band...excellent sound and a fun one to listen...just heard about them last year...I know,  I must be behind the times...they are great!
B007J4T2G8|3.0|Dont like the way this woman is treated, nor the way she cowtows to a man, doing whatever he says without question.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Good time playing  game you will enjoy at any age. Fun for adults and easy enough for us older folks.
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|What a great app! I have already enjoyed a few hours of gameplay and am very glad that I downloaded this- plus it gave me 110 free Amazon coins. I have not invested any money in this and as long as you're a moderately patient person, you don't have to put any real money into this game. I give it 5 stars for its freeness and for its ability to be entertaining throughout the days. It does want you to sync with your Facebook account but if you choose not to do that, you still have access to the full game ( as far as I can tell anyway ). Great graphics, cute characters, I recommend this app!
B0095XPZBC|3.0|This review is not for the show, I'll leave that to more dedicated Trekkies. In short, while still enjoyable, there is a NOTICEABLE difference in picture quality over Season 1. Lot's of grain, poor blacks and shadow quality. I didn't notice as much disparity in the space scenes, it's more indoor scenes that you notice it.
B0036OS3I8|5.0|In canary yellow, this is such a perky, comfy boot for the rain. I don't think it's substantial enough for the snow or severe cold however.
B00ARHAAZ6|5.0|Sanderson knocked it out of the park again with his world building in Steelheart.  The magic system is super intriguing.<br /><br />Definitely a young adult story yet was very entertaining to me.  (Unfortunately I am no longer a young adult!)<br /><br />If you want a fun read pick this book up!
B006P1Y6EE|5.0|This album is a milestone in rock history.  Neil Young's back-up group makes an incredible debut on its own with the same ragged sound that can be found on Young's records, but with a flourish of its own.  What great songs on this album!  Great singing, playing, and production.  Great, great, great--I can't give this album enough praise.<br /><br />This is Crazy Horse when the creative influence of Danny Whitten was still present.  We get the added assets of Jack Nitzsche, Nils Lofgren, and Ry Cooder.  How does a group miss with a line-up like that?  What could they have become had this line-up remained together?<br /><br />Alas, things are as they are and we are left with one of the best albums of rock.  The music is rootsy and from the heart.  Back porch playing charged with the studio electricity.  When you hear this band on this album, you easily understand why Neil Young chose them to help create his own place in rock history.<br /><br />It's masterful stuff as far as home grown rock and roll is concerned.
B0066WJLU6|4.0|Nice to have flash light and phone in one, work construction and this app has come in handy more than once.
B00BD99JMW|3.0|The plot got very muddled for me and I felt Four's character got away from the author.  The ending, although surprising, didn't enhance the story in any way.
B00B5HQKNI|3.0|Good action adventure as Bond movies usually are.  The problem with the Daniel Craig Bond movies is that there is absolutely no sense of humor to them.  The Bond movies always had humor that is sorely lacking since Craig became Bond.
B00BPDR3F6|5.0|Within just a few pages I was hooked...and hooked with beautiful script that flowed like a flawlessly woven blanket that wrapped you deeper into its pages...really enjoyable!

B00AJLHUAS|1.0|This album is infuriating because the audio was apparently deliberately ruined by processing to mimic the miserable sound of old records and the limitations of 1930's technology.  Otherwise I would have rated it highly because the orchestral arrangements seem well blended, smooth, and melodious.
B005COO1X6|2.0|Every time I read a Stephen King book, or see the movie, I get into the story, wonder about the science fiction mystery component and then suddenly the story is over with no explanation. I don't like stories ending like that, I like closure. His stories get me every time!
B00B0LPWU6|2.0|Pretty disappointing from the standpoint of plot and writing.  I like Denzel and the acting was generally good.  The writing moved from one contrived situation to the next.  The dialog did not ring true, and the same applies to the behavior of the characters.  The main character is totally overwhelmed by his addictions.  That much is believable, although presented at the extreme end of the spectrum.  Throughout the film, though, people behave and talk in unrealistic ways.  There is a final hearing scene on the plane crash (the driver of the plot here).  The hearings scene makes no sense at all and is just one example of the writers wanting certain things to happen and forcing the characters into behavior and situations that don't seem natural or believable.  I would take a pass on this, and hope that Denzel will find better vehicles.  He's been on a bad roll lately.

B00C74SHRK|4.0|Donna Tartt has woven together an interesting and at times thrilling ride through the world of art, antiques, NYC establishment and the sludge of Las Vegas - theft, murder, terrorism  - love, family, compassion - neglect, violence, loss and of course the meaning of life itself. A great read
B006LSZECO|1.0|I read the book to it's closing, so it obviously possessed enough suspense that I had to find out what was 'really' going on with these characters.  However, when I finished I felt let down and immensely irritated at the ending, these characters, the ridiculous story line and that I wasted my valuable time hoping sincerely that surely there would be a 'healthier' outcome for these two characters.  Disappointing.  I doubt I'll read Gillian Flynn's work again.

B00B0LPWU6|2.0|I gave it two stars because the first few minutes in the hotel room are gratuitous rated X and almost ruin the movie.  Full nudity did not have to be shown; I had to look away which soured me on the beginning.  Anyway, the real story is about addiction and redemption - In that regard, the movie was outstanding. Although what is unbelievable was HOW LONG (years apparently) had this pilot been drinking and how all flight crew knew about it, and STILL no one said nothing. WOW. That is scary.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Great game. Always fun, some easy some hard, keeps you playing on. I like that when you win, the next level is a little different then the one before.
0553593714|3.0|I have actually never read this book. However, my basis of giving it 3 stars is that you could probably do better, but given the amount of crap out there, you could do a lot worse.
159463176X|3.0|I feel very strongly about Khaled Hosseini's books. I've read all three: The Kite Runner, A Thousand Splendid Suns, and now his third novel, And the Mountains Echoed. They are all set in his home country of Afghanistan (with significant California cameos, and additionally for AtME - gay Paree and Grecian Tinos). Because the Americans (and almost every other world power) have had their (often dirty) hands in that part of the world, I think it's especially important for said citizens to read these books.<br /><br />\\"My patients knew this. They saw that much of what they were, would be, or could be hinged on the symmetry of their bone structure, the space between their eyes... Beauty is an enormous, unmerited gift given randomly, stupidly.\\"<br /><br />You won't find poetic writing or complex plots or nuanced characters. I did think \\"A Thousand Splendid Suns\\" had a gratifyingly strong female lead, but mostly the characters in all 3 novels verge on stereotypes and foils. The plot points are often tear jerkingly tragic or manipulative. The writing is ordinary.<br /><br />\\"I know now some people feel unhappiness the way others love: privately, intensely, and without recourse.\\"<br /><br />BUT you will see an Afghanistan that is rarely in the news, and you will meet Afghanis just like everyone else in the world, i.e. human beings with the same love, money, family issues that everyone struggles with. AtME additionally shifts POV several times between very different characters and I liked this quite well.<br /><br />\\"For courage, there must be something at stake. I come here with nothing to lose.\\"<br /><br />For this, the humanizing of a country that has been torn up by war and the Taliban and the Western media, read these books, any one of them (I might slightly recommend one of his other two books over AtME). But whichever it is, you'll blow through it - they are easy reads, thrilling, sweet, melodramatic, and moving (especially if you're like me and victims of memory loss and strokes reduce you to weeping (that's in AtME)). There's a reason Mr. Hosseini's books become international bestsellers, one after another. And I'm glad for it.<br /><br />\\"Out beyond ideas of wrongdoing and right doing, there is a field. I'll meet you there. - Rumi\\"
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love this game! It is a game that I can call &quot;Me Time!&quot;  It passes time,, is easy and fun! Thanks Kindle for finally adding the app! I was super excited when I found out it was on the kindle! It's nice on a bigger screen instead of on the phone!

B007VGXS8M|1.0|Very dissappointed that this app didn't even open up on my Kindle Fire HD, purchased it because my 4 year old grandson LOVES our old Where's Waldo books that his father had as a child and thought he'd enjoy it on the Kindle.  We did better by going to a local Goodwill store and finding a couple of old books :(
0385743564|5.0|Steelheart is an exciting read, more so than even some of Sanderson's adult fiction, but it doesn't feel at the same level Mistborn or The Way of Kings. We should all remember this isn't supposed to be like his adult fiction though. This is a post apocalyptic superhero world, which is worlds away from Roshar and the Cosmere. It is a vengeance story about Epics (those with superpowers) in a future Earth after a calamity that gave them their powers. The twist is the Epics aren't necessarily out to save lives, but do things in their own best interest. The protagonist David, is a bit too much of a know-it-all for me to really like him<br /><br />Steelheart is perfect for introducing people to Sanderson and a quick moving story to boot. I hope to write a longer review at some point.
B00AAX68HG|5.0|My grandson and I both love it, some are easy, some are difficult and some we have to wait until his father gets here to show us how to solve!  Good for all ages.
B00DMKFN34|2.0|This is more concerning the disk and packaging then the movie, are in the process of watching it now.  We received the item ontime, but the third disk, the DVD was missing from the package.  Amazon is taking care of the missing disk.  But the sound on this blu-ray disk is horrible, I have the tv turned up full sound 40+ and we can just hear it ok.  Poor audio.
B000BB1MI2|5.0|Awesome movie and can't beat the price, as a prime member shipping is free and anytime I can get great movies shipped to my house for under $5 it's a steal, actually purchased more for gifts.
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|A lot of fun.  I have no complaints so far.  Easy to figure out.  Doesn't require a huge investment of time or money.  That being said, I can't stop playing it!
B00C5R7B0I|5.0|I love Patricia Cornwell's Scarpetta series. This one does not disappoint. I finished this one in 2 days. I could not put it down, the suspense was the perfect amount. I just hate that I have to wait for a new book to be written.

B00459EZLW|5.0|It was well written and played.<br /><br />It presents a story for the search for human destiny. Every human and the whole creation have a purpose and guided by the unknown. What or who is the unknown behind our destiny is the quest science or rational thinking seeks to find out. We await to see the final result.<br /><br />The other thing worth of note is that for one to reach her/his destiny, there are huddles to jump over, barriers to breakthrough, etc. which some have to be overcome by the person with the help and guidance of the unknown, or the unknown working it out for the person. The fortunate thing is that the unknown is always there to help the person beyond the known scene.<br /><br />Life is worth believing what you believe in (rational) but worth much more expecting and believing the vague (irrational).<br /><br />I recommend it for anyone who likes playing the game for the riddle of life, or wants to understand how to decode the mystery behind human destiny.
B007K3JFUQ|4.0|I got this as a gift for my beloved and the movie itself was amazing! I was worried about the protection sticker in the middle, because it was very difficult to get off and because of it i think is the reason it skipped the DVD a bit. But Overall, I'm very happy with my movie~!

Until a better, a MUCH BETTER company or system comes along we've purchased our last movie with digital download.
B0083Z614S|5.0|A delightful story about a spoiled little girl who becomes orphened. She gets moved into her uncle's big house where she discovers new places. There is suspense wondering what will happen next with her.
B00B0LPWU6|4.0|Denzel is a great actor and this movie is one of his best.  It didn't end like I expected but I like the ending. I don't think it did well at the box office but it's no fault of the movie.  Definitely check it out.

B007QPFGJW|4.0|Harry Hole ranks right up there with my other favorite misfit fictional dectectives, America's Harry Bosch, and Britain's Alan Banks. He's a much more &#34;damaged&#34; person and his exploits take many more twists and turns, but I would like to see him have more than a couple of days of happiness, once in awhile. Now, without spoiling for the readers, Harry's future is really in doubt. All of Nesbo's books are impossible to put down but they generally leave one depressed, even with Harry is successful, which is my reason for 4 stars. One side to reading this series is that it makes you want to learn Swedish so you can more easily pronounce the names of all the town and sites.
B00383ZTXO|5.0|\\"Raw Power\\" is an album that really needs no explanation. Released the same year as that other trailblazing proto-punk classic \\"New York Dolls\\", the Stooges' third (and ultimately final) studio record was the antithesis to the safer, meticulously produced and more melodic rock bands dominating radio stations at the time. With its sludgy yet exhilarating guitars, an endearingly sloppy rhythm section and the immeasurable Iggy Pop wallowing with ferocious intensity, \\"Raw Power\\" received mixed reviews, but is now cited as forerunner of punk rock, post-punk rock, noise rock and heavy metal and widely regarded as one of the greatest rock albums of all time. And deservedly so.<br /><br />Equally deserving, however, was the damnation it received when the album was released in a newly mixed version in 1997. When \\"Raw Power\\" was released on CD that year, many fans were outraged by how stupefyingly loud it was. As it turned out, Iggy Pop and executive producer Bruce Dickinson remixed the whole album in hopes to pushed the volume all the way to the limit. The reason was they felt that the original David Bowie mix sounded weak and under-produced (to the fair, most members of the Stooges felt the same way) and strive to make \\"Raw Power\\" a more powerful experience for listeners.<br /><br />Needless to say, the 1997 version is an absolute disgrace. Listening to the album was like putting your ear next to a circular saw. The guitars became distorted, making some of James Williamson's explosive guitar work sound muddled and stilted; the bass playing was inaudible; and the overall loudness too overbearing for even those with the most resistant ears. Sadly, for years, this was the only version available in public domain, since the original 1989 CD version went out of print and is pretty much forgotten.<br /><br />But that all changed in 2010 when Columbia re-released \\"Raw Power\\" in the 2-CD Deluxe version, using the original David Bowie mix. Needless to say, it is a welcome relief. For once, fans can finally hear the clarity, intensity and enthusiastic bravado that was obliterated by the oppressive 1997 mix. Songs like \\"Search and Destroy\\", \\"Your Pretty Face is Going to Hell\\" and \\"Shake Appeal\\" no longer sounded like distorted messes; they sound like riveting, no-holds-barred songs by a band ready to take on the world and destroy everything in their path. Williamson's guitar scorches the speakers like a blazing inferno; Ron Asheton's bass and Scott Asheton's drums can finally be heard; and Iggy Pop's voice still sounds as demonic as ever, prove that he didn't need to turn up the volume to express his inner rage.<br /><br />In addition to that, Columbia also includes the 1973 live concert from Georgia Peaches on the second disc, plus a couple of extra tracks. These are welcome additions, but the David Bowie mix remains the main attraction. Now presented in its undiluted form, people can finally comprehend the album's greatness. When listening to this album, one can trace the influence it had on some of the greatest, most uncompromising rock bands of 80s-90s, from Sonic Youth and Black Flag to Nirvana and Husker Du.<br /><br />And what greatness this album possesses! Each of these nine songs are superb, inspirational and emotionally exhaustive. The riveting \\"Search and Destroy\\" can still send a shiver down a listener's spine, no matter how much it has been covered; the awesome title track still has lost none of its spontaneity (the Guns N' Roses cover was more melodic but nowhere near as powerful); \\"Gimme Danger\\" is alluring in its menace and dreary feel; \\"I Need Somebody\\" plays like an irresistible sludgy cross of psychedelic garage rock, jazz and avant-garde; \\"Shake Appeal\\" and \\"Your Pretty Face is Going to Hell\\", two of the album's most ferocious rockers, make all the imitators look like parodies. And \\"Death Trip\\" sounds just like that; a horrific descent to hell that once listened can never be ignored.<br /><br />\\"Raw Power\\" is one of rock n' roll's greatest treasures and essential listen to anyone want to form a good, old-fashioned rock n' roll band. But make sure you get the 2-CD Legacy edition and avoid the 1997 version like the plague. When you listen to the David Bowie mix, you'll understand that if there's anything better than will power, it's raw power.<br /><br />Strongest recommendation to steal at all costs.oll's greatest treasures and essential listen to anyone want to form a good, old-fashioned rock n' roll band.

B00BAXFJ5M|4.0|Sam Wingo is on a secret mission to deliver a cargo to a destination in Afghanistan. When he arrives, instead of the people he expects to meet, men identifying themselves as CIA relieve him of the shipment. Sam knows something's wrong and believes he's been set up, but who will believe him?<br /><br />King and Maxwell are driving through a storm, trying to decide where to go for some R and R. When a teenager waving a gun runs across the path of their car, their vacation dreams are put on hold. The teenager is Tyler Wingo, Sam's son. He's just learned that his father was killed in Afghanistan, and he doesn't believe it. In fact, the next day, he calls to hire King and Maxwell to find out what happened to his father.<br /><br />This book is an action packed adventure ranging from Afghanistan to Washington, DC. The action starts slowly with King and Maxwell trying to help Tyler, but speeds up by the middle of the book and from there it's a race to the end. Some of the plot is quite far-fetched, but in a quick read it isn't bothersome.<br /><br />I enjoyed the characters. King and Maxwell have a stuttering love affair which drives lots of repartee. I can't say it feels realistic, especially when Dana, Sam's ex-wife comes on the scene, but it's fun. My favorite character is Edgar, the clueless computer genius. His inability to understand the real world of human relations is amusing.<br /><br />If you want a fast-paced, international adventure with a little romance and comedy thrown in, you'll enjoy this book. It would make a great beach read.<br /><br />I reviewed this book for Net Galley.

I don't know what others consider good time rock and roll - but if thats what you're looking for - here it is.  But what do I know....

B008RJ6TTC|5.0|This collection is just perfection. Magnificent clear sound and picture, and even better than first-run now that I've got a 60-inch TV. Each season is in its own five- or six- DVD case, two episodes per disc ... and no two-sided discs to drive you crazy. My husband and I love Columbo and we treat ourselves to a couple of episodes every weekend. This would be the perfect gift. Columbo was world-class television programming with unforgettable plots, terrific guest stars and (of course) the incomparable Peter Falk.

B00GH4RKYM|3.0|Spoiler alert? WAY over the top!<br /><br />When anything is possible, (as it is with CGI) there is no wow factor left -- That leaves only acting and writing to depend on, which leaves this film needing work -- perhaps a complete re-write and re-filming by a better team?<br /><br />If nothing else, 'Man of Steel' is a huge improvement over the &#34;boy of fluff&#34;  that 'Superman Returns' gave us in 2006 -- But, this one  lacks the warmth, heart, soul and  humor of earlier portrayals. It never really figures out where it's at, where it comes from or even where it's going. The opening sequence sure looks like a direct rip from the 1989 batman movie --  After that, interesting as it may be, I couldn't help but think how right at home Batman would feel on Krypton  - it doesn't look all that different from an over-sized &#34;Vulcan Batcave&#34;, ( the Krypton Elders outfits look like something out of Star Trek ).  Maybe the El family and the Waynes aren't  that different, after all?

0385537131|5.0|One of Grisham's best efforts. He correctly portrays Mississippi as it existed in the late &#34;80's. Whites expect blacks to be subservient in all respects. When a black maid inherits $20 million plus dollars from a white man, whites are appalled and will do almost anything to stop it.(Especially the relatives of the disceased.) Relatives who neither liked or had seen the deceased in years, show up in droves at the smell of money. &#34;Stop that black n%$$#r is the clarion call.&#34;
B005WUHAX8|1.0|After many years of on-line shopping I have never offered a review for a product. I am writing this review based on the deceptive marketing of the product and the complete failure of Lifeproof to stand by its warranty.<br /><br />I would strongly recommend not buying this case.  While using the case under water to take photos (less than 2 meters deep) I noticed a leak inside the case.  I immediately took my iPhone out of the case to attempt to dry it out.  Fortunately there was no long term damage to my phone.  I decided to return the case based on its poor performance and nearly ruining my iPhone. Unfortunately I discovered that because the case was purchased more than 30 days earlier (2.5 months earlier) I could not return it (neither Amazon nor Lifeproof offered a return).  Given that Lifeproof does not even allow a return of its defective product after 30 days, I think the chances of them replacing your phone if it were damaged is virtually zero. Highly disappointing.

Sometimes I need paper and pencil to write down clues or shapes, but the puzzles are clever enough to keep the game interesting, without losing you to frustration. The 3 clues you get for each puzzle along the way are somewhat helpful, but not overly... which is good.<br /><br />I'm sure it will get harder as I progress through this, and I will update my review later, but so far I find this a stunning, well crafted though out puzzle. If you liked MYST, you will certainly enjoy this!

Even if someone has never heard of The Secret, or even if they have and do not believe in it, this book can't help but effect them. I loved it and even though it was meant for all, I especially love it for teens and young people. It gives them a new look at their heros, and shows them that they are heros, too!
B00G722T22|2.0|Some of the songs are pretty good and play to her strengths, but overall I'm not thrilled by this album. Like many others, I wish she would grow up a bit and move on past her high school days.<br /><br />Has anyone else noticed the glitch on the track &#34;Falling Fast&#34; that occurs around 0:27? Why wasn't that fixed during recording?

1451613520|5.0|This historical accounting is very well written. The historical scenarios are an amazing eye-opener;  so contradictory to the propaganda  we have been served.  The unsung heroes have been eclipsed by the hawks and war mongers and imperialists.  The text should be required reading by all students of history.

B0000DJZA5|5.0|I had never heard the naked version until recently. I love hearing a different take on these songs. I really thought I would miss the big choral arrangements, and orchestration. As I listened to songs like The Long and Winding Road or Across The Universe I found myself hearing nuances that were lost on the big production version. My ears enjoy the simplicity of piano and guitar. I can see now why Paul wanted a redo on the production of this work.

0375507256|2.0|I tried, I really tried but could not get past the first part of the book.  It bored me with it's pretentions old world English writing style that our modern day authors do not use as we don't want to feel like we're sitting in an English Lit class.  I wanted the Cliff notes for this book and since I was reading for pleasure, I put the book down - something I rarely ever do.  If you're one of those that enjoyed reading Moby Dick, then by all means read this book.  I had to come back to Amazon to make sure the author was from my era and was written in this century.  I liked the movie so surely I thought I'd read more up on it from the book.  Boy was I wrong.

B00EE3FVSU|4.0|This series had many flaws, the main one being that it seemed that every person who'd ever had questionable dealings with children had somehow ended up in one small seaside town.  Good lord--the people in that town were weird.<br /><br />But I loved the detectives and would certainly welcome seeing them again, if they dare show their faces.  They did not cover themselves with glory as investigators, but as characters, they were first rate.
B001BANK32|5.0|Wonderfully written, suspenseful, and thought-provoking. Unlike the sequel, Dr. Sleep, which pales in comparison, this book is a study in a man fighting his demons and a young boy learning to live with his supernatural gift. If you've seen the movie, you'll find that the book is very different, but I think you can enjoy both.  King is at his best here.
B00B0LPYXG|3.0|Firdt of all, GET YOUR ACT TOGETHER AMAZON - I ALREADY RATED THIS FILM. Frankly it is WAAAAAAAYYYYYYYYY too predictable. No chance for a surprise ending to this film.  Because it is so likely, it tends to get a little boring in spots and instead of inspring, it becomes preaching upon the evils of demon rum and the corner pharmacy. (You know, the one with a raincoat and shades on - LOL). Worth the time to watch it (Hey! It IS Denzel after all).Not worth spending any money for admission, rental, etc.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|This book was recommend ed  to me by my husband who is a history buff. His excitement about this fictional book made me ever so compelled to read it, I now know why his excitement was so great. I recommend this book for all time travelers of anytime.

B00GME9AJK|5.0|I bought the movie (for the price of a couple of rentals) because I had a hunch I'd want to see it more than once - and it's proved to be the case.<br /><br />If you're expecting a biopic documentary full of Steve Jobs facts and ephemera then this movie is not going to cut it for you.  It is, in essence, a fictional drama stitched together with a base of factual characters and events.  In fact it's clear that's the case since we all feel like we know heaps about Steve Jobs thanks to his very very public persona.<br /><br />Overall Ashton Kutcher does an excellent job of portraying Jobs; he does fall a little short in my mind, the accent was good but just not quite right, the explosive anger spilled out well but this was Steve's well-known nuclear option wielded to great effect and the film's character spilled forth like a mini Krakatoa but did not convince that it was the wrath of an angered demi-god on the edge of spitting your soul which is how I'd been led to believe it felt to be on the withering end of a Jobs' tirade.<br /><br />The scenes around the conception and younger years of Lisa, Steve's first child felt like they were paid lip-service in some ways and perhaps it's the geek in me that wanted it to either be the foundation of why Steve became who he was or to prop up some fundamental turning point in his life.  Instead the movie hints at this awkwardly and confuses the early hippy years, trips to Indian swamis and calligraphy classes in a way that seemed a bit like an area of script that was heavily edited for time and as a result left knotted into a bit of a mess that did not help bolster the rest of the film.<br /><br />Josh Gad's Woz is the right amount of awkward and soft-hearted obtuse-thinking boffin which is how I perceive the real Steve Wozniak to be.  Dermot Mulroney played a blindingly good and convincing performance as Mike Markkula so much so it almost became a mini \\"my time with Apple\\" biopic of the great man.<br /><br />For all the actors it must have been extremely intimidating to play any of the characters since they are so well known and many many hours of footage exists of them with virtually every Apple geek in the world feeling like they know their every nuance.  A very tough thing to do.  I think it worked.<br /><br />Overall a good even-paced movie but probably not one you're going to rave about.  For Apple fans like myself - a MUST HAVE and must see movie.  As a computer geek hailing from the 70s and 80s it was a five star \\"loved it\\" for me.t must have been extremely intimidating to play any of the characters since they are so well known and many many hours of footage exists of them with virtually every Apple geek in the world feeling like they know their every nuance.

B002QW7ALM|5.0|Excellent sci-fi/action/horror movie.  Kept me on the edge of my scene for its entirety.  One of the best sci-fi movies I've watched in a while.  Don't let the fact that it did poorly at the box office fool you into skipping this gem.
B00FPH6AXE|1.0|A very poor film for me.  Beautifully shot but with a terrible dialogue and paper-thin plot.<br /><br />Will Smith plays it straight, supported by his son too, and I really thought with Will's experience it could turn out to be something great but, really, it wasn't even a great waste of time.

B00BD99JMW|5.0|WARNING-----&#62;SPOILERS AHEAD!<br />*<br />*<br />*<br />*<br />*<br />*<br />*<br />*<br />*<br />*<br />*<br />*<br />*<br />*<br />NOTE: Before I get into anything in regards to this book I am stating right now and as clear as day that there will be spoilers in this review. If I could get around it I would but it is basically impossible based on this being a last book in a series and what actually went down in the book. If you do not want to be spoiled I suggest that you stop reading right now, pick up the book, and then come back and see what I have to say.<br /><br />First things first, Allegiant was by far the best series ending I have ever read. Now with saying this I have to tell you my sentiment is in the minority. People are furious with how this book ended. They feel cheated and they feel used and there is a huge controversy brewing over this. But for me Allegiant was the perfect ending for a series about choices and it really couldn't have gone any better. It broke my heart, gave me such book anxiety that I was dreaming about the characters(a good Theo James dream never hurt anyone!) and affected me in a way a series never has before. Veronica Roth made a gutsy choice much like the choices in the series and I applaud her for that decision.<br /><br />Allegiant is the final chapter in the story of Tris, Four and company and dystopian Chicago. After the cliffhanger ending that was Insurgent and the death and carnage that was Divergent Allegiant is the story of what is outside the city walls. About what is true and what has been falsified. About how the city came to be what it is today. About the choices we all make. About life and death. Armed with the knowledge that there is life outside the city walls Tris and Four and a few other familiar faces journey away from the tumultuous world where Evelyn(Four's mother) is a tyrannical leader to an unknown place that is as strange as it is familiar. Integrating themselves into this new society which has no factions but a Bureau and a clear division between what is known as GPs(genetically pure) and GDs(genetically damaged). As lies begin to be uncovered and sides are drawn Tris and Four have to make some hard choices that could affect themselves, their loved ones and their relationship forever.<br /><br />Okay so I'm the first to admit that Allegiant is very heavy with the world building which is completely understandable in this case. Us, as readers, needed a clear picture of just exactly was taking place outside the fence. And even though it is heavy with world building I think Roth did it pretty flawlessly by never using 50 words when 10 could suffice(a pet peeve of mine) and making sure we felt like part of the world, could see all sides of the argument, had a choice on what to believe ourselves. And although it was a lot of information I think it aided in the story as we got to see just what this characters were up against. Simply put, discrimination was happening between the GPs and the GDs and Roth made sure the readers saw that so we understood the choices that Tris and Four had whether we agreed with them or not.<br /><br />Another part of Allegiant that was different but worked was the use of dual points of views. From the first two books we only got to see Tris perspective, her thoughts on things, her reasoning behind why she was behaving the way she was. Making another tough decision Roth decided to tell Allegiant using Four's voice as well and I have to say I was a little worried about this when I heard the announcement that this would be the set up for Allegiant. But in true Roth fashion she made a believer out of me. From the first time a chapter was from Four's POV I knew exactly why she had decided to go that route and I embraced it. I was no longer left to wonder what was going on in the sexy, former Dauntless instructors head. I no longer had to wonder if he really had any flaws or doubts or self-esteem issues. It was nice to finally see Four as a broken boy that felt uncertain of his past and of his future and of himself. Up until this point it was hinted at that he didn't want to be like his father and that was a fear of his, but Allegiant brought it to the surface and showed just how much damage was done emotionally to him by both of his parents.<br /><br />Allegiant also showed the growth of Tris. In Divergent she was a naive girl just trying to fit in and do what she thought was right. In Insurgent she was a girl that had demons she couldn't escape and in trying to do so became self-destructive and had no thoughts for the others that loved her. But in Allegiant Tris was his powerhouse girl that made tough calls and no longer was a adrenaline junkie. She grew up and was ready to do what was right and to make the choices she had to. Was this damning to her relationship to Four at times, it was, but I also understood where it was coming from. The ups and downs in their relationship, although uncomfortable for me to read, were natural as they made choices the other didn't agree with, but I never once didn't feel the love or the connection or their emotional bond. Someone in the book said it best, they were really good for each other.<br /><br />&#60;MAJOR SPOILER ALERT&#62;<br />But really, all of my thoughts on the above is nothing compared to what happened in the final 10% of the book that rocked a fan base across the world. A decision that was so gutsy that it left infuriated people in its wake. Roth did the one thing that very few authors are will to do. She killed off one of her main characters...she killed off Tris. And you know what, she made the right decision. I'm not going to sugarcoat it, I cried, straight up ugly cry, sobbing for the last 30 minutes of reading this book. My heart was 100% shattered and it ached when I was finished. But I still think one of the most gusty calls was the right call because everything aside it fit right in with everything that we knew about Tris and the Divergent series from the beginning. This series from the get go was about choices. The Choosing Ceremony, picking faction over blood, choosing sides, choosing violence over piece, choosing the city over life outside the fence, choosing to live or die, choosing to leave. Everything was about choices and when it came down to it the biggest choice had to be made by Tris and she did it in a way she never thought fit her. She did it after being told time and time again that she would never have this characteristic. She did it out of pure selflessness and that is why Roth made the right call. Tris was one of the most selfless people in the book and by giving her life, her safety up to save the lives of all of the people that had helped her and touched her and loved her, she did the most selfless thing a person could do. She choose them.<br /><br />So yes, I know that my opinion is on an island of its own. I know that Allegiant is unfairly being racked through the coals and I also know that if people took a minute to think about it and to think of all the pieces that feel into place through the series and the guts it took for Roth to do this to one of her babies, I think you will start to see the magic that is Allegiant. I think you will start to see why this book is my pick for best series ender. You'll see why I wasn't disappointed even though it devastated me.  Veronica Roth did something amazing with Allegiant and I will forever be grateful to her for bringing this story and these people into my life. And for having the guts to do it the way she did. Bravo Ms. Roth, bravo!

My son liked it a lot and was a big Cars fan prior.<br /><br />If you buy this edition be warned- the digital version is not iTunes compatible. Only the BluRay edition comes with an iTunes version.

B000HKYOK0|3.0|Weird, wacky, meaningful and awesome. Those are just some of the words I'd use to describe Star Trek: TOS. I watched this series recently because although I consider myself quite the &#34;trekkie&#34;, I never saw the original series all the way through. This review is about the first season so please don't hate me. Taking in to consideration that I watch a 1960's show in 2013, I really liked this series as a whole. The first season was good but not my personal favorite. For the most part, season one is a work in progress. There are some really good sci/fi stories mixed in with a bunch of really dumb ones. When it's good this show is good. When it's bad well...you know. Anyway, science fiction fans must watch this show in order to understand the phenomenon and learn who it was that inspired generations of science fiction shows and movies to follow. Watch and have fun.

0307352153|5.0|Finally, a book for the rest of the world that describes how we introverts have to cope in an extroverted world. It's not pretty and for me, it has caused untold damage. The chapter that discusses the change to cubicles and open-plan space and the stress it has placed on introverts should be required reading for all businesses. Hopefully lots of people in HR, managers and others will read this book. Lord knows they need to gain insight on working with introverts and the tremendous value we bring to the world.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Couldn't put the book down till the book was over.  Sad the it is the last book in the series.
B007LNJ4YW|3.0|What I like about the music is that it is different.  It has a Hawaiian music feel to it. I'm always looking for new sound combinations.  But this album can get tiring after awhile as there is a lot a repetition of the sound.  After listening to the sound of Victoria's voice in an echo chamber the bloom soon wears off.  This is the 2nd album I've bought and without the printed lyrics I would not be able understand but very few words.  But then it does not matter much as the words don't seem to make much sense.<br /><br />The text include in the attractive cardboard folder is the smallest I have ever seen with a compact disc album.  I had to use a magnifying glass to read it.  Why is the text full of typos and lines misplaced?  It is meant to be artistic?  It is a disservice to the fans to include such a poorly print.

1451626096|4.0|At first I was not sure how to rate this book. On the one hand I had enjoyed reading it, on the other I was put off while reading it by what I thought were gross deviations from the actual historical events.  But after finishing the book, and doing a bit of fact checking, I realized that although most historians bought into Henry Tudor's story that Perkin Warbeck was a pretender, there are many that believe that he could in fact be Prince Richard. I now tend to agree with the later. Here are just few of my reasons based on historical facts that I found:<br /><br />1. Henry VII himself behaved as if he believed Perkin Warbeck was the true prince.  He executed Perkin for treason. But only an Englishman (Prince Richard) could be executed for treason not Perkin Warbeck who was not born an Englishman.<br />2. Many royals believed that he was the prince. (Scotland, Austria, France and Spain.) Could he have really fooled so many KIngs and royals.  Could he have gotten them to support him in war if he was not a prince?<br />3. The King and Queen of Spain wrote a letter that still survives today saying that all possible heirs (\\"the boy\\" and the Earl of Warwick) must be killed before they would allow Arthur to marry their daughter.  They must have thought that \\"the boy\\" was in fact a true heir or there would have been no reason to require his execution.<br />4.The King of Scottland let him marry his daughter and even backed him up to fight for the crown. His daughter also believed that he was the prince even after he was put to death.<br />5. Margaret of Burgundy (Prince Richard's aunt) supported him. Would she have actually supported a \\"pretender\\"? Would she have really wanted non-royal blood on the throne?<br />6. How did he become a gifted musician and learn to speak Latin (the real Richard was a talented musician and knew Latin as well). Is it probably that a pretender who not only looked like Richard and was born of a drunk would also be a talented musician and know Latin, just like the prince?<br />7. Elizabeth's own mother supported \\"the boy\\". Would a mother actually support an imposter who would overthrow her daughter's husband and her own grandchild? Or would she only do this for her son?
B000YJ54DU|1.0|I think it's time to retire Reacher if this tale is the best you can do Lee.<br />Such a shame. A return policy with a full refund should be offered on purchases like this.

B00BD99JMW|3.0|Oh, Ms. Roth...I so wanted to love this book as I enjoyed the first two books in the series.<br /><br />Alas, I could not.<br /><br />The first two books were filled with action, excitement, daring, battles, struggles.  And this one?  It was filled with angst and regret.<br /><br />Yes, I am disappointed with what happened to Tris towards the end.  Could I see why you did it?  Of course.  As the author, you have the right, power, and choice to do what you want with your characters.  And I could see why you chose to go the route you did.  I don't have a problem with that.<br /><br />The problem I had was that nothing much happened in this book.  All the suspense and tension was missing.  And I did not like the Tobias/Tris changing point of view narration.  As a reader, I could not tell which character was telling the story, as they both sounded so similar.<br /><br />It's almost as if you ran out of steam after book two.  There was a tremendous set-up at the end of book two; perhaps you just....got tired.<br /><br />I wish I could've liked this book.  It took me  month to get through it, and I zipped through the first two.  I felt like I was slogging in mud to finish this, like I was obligated to.<br /><br />I did enjoy learning more about Tris' mother, and what lay outside the city.  But, it felt flat, underdeveloped.

B00F076VA6|4.0|fair enough, though there´s a bunch of new places to go to for this including TripAdvisor with user´s ratings and updated constantly
B00GOQ9M4O|5.0|This was one of my favorite episodes. The conflict in this episode was more apparent within yourself than on screen. It doesn't make you question your definition of right and wrong, but the timing between wrong, then right.
B00G15MWSG|5.0|The Movie is in subtitled in English but the voices are in Japan voices. The Movie is good and funny is great to have if you don't want to wait for English dub.
B00ESY77LO|2.0|There was too much focus on flashy effects, music, and the WOW-factor, and not enough focus on the character development.  This is a story of internal struggle and emotional subtext. None of that was present in this re-make.
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|Love this game wish the storage was easier to upgrade .... I would play it more than I usually do
B00785P2QC|5.0|Awesome game; easy game to learn and understand. I have downloaded this game two weeks ago and I don't find any problems with it
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|We finally can play this fun game on Kindle!!  I no longer have to pout or stay glued to my PC!!  I'm enjoying this immensely!!  Don't take so long with the next fun game!!
B002GJT4XW|1.0|The content itself its perfect, but its not the product i purchased and ordered, I've got the DVD inted of BluRay version of the film.
1932100660|5.0|Fantastic study of cancer causes, reversals, and prevention.  A must read for anyone who doesn't trust the drug companies and charities who claim to be seeking the causes and cures of cancer.  The only book necessary on cancer prevention.
B009NFHF0Q|4.0|I liked it very much, I could't stop reading it all this days, it was so rich in  metaphoras . Bat the Two moons remember me the Murakami's 1Q84
B006LSZECO|4.0|Very good book!  Some parts a little predictable but there are also so big twists!  This should be made into a movie!
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|I played Castleville on Facebook. While I really enjoyed it, it was constantly crashing and freezing. But the app version is awesome! It doesn't take forever to load and it hasn't crashed or froze once! I love this game, although I do wish it was a little bit more like the Facebook version. Overall, this game is really fun and addictive! Don't believe me? Try it yourself! Bet you can't put it down!
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|I love books that tangle through different peoples stories to show how every ones life is affected by others decisions. Great read that really makes you think at the end
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|I like these simple little games. I don't like how you have to tap and then drag. Still fun though
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Love this game.....my kids love love love this game!!!!! The animation is really awesome. The minions are perfect.... best part of the game!!!!
B0015AARJI|4.0|it's a nice controller. I really like it. I rate it a four just because its not an amazing controller.
B00CWY76CC|2.0|This game NEEDS HINTS.  If one gets stuck, the game offers no help or hints whatsoever, so that's that.  Game over...  unless you want to keep doodling around for hours & hours, which I'm not interested in doing.  If the game had a hint button, it would be pretty good.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|great read, couldn't put it down. it kept my interest up on what was going to happen in every chapter. highly recommended
B00ATSBIIG|4.0|Very nice graphics.  Lots of variety and relaxing game to play.  The finished pictures are really cool, and pretty, and satisfying.
B00BATKPBE|5.0|I'm loving this book so far.  Richard Dawkins life is so interesting and his work is so important to us all.
B003VTZTU8|2.0|Redundant with earlier books and focused mostly on MMR. Previous similar books have been much broader in topics covered and with more statistics.
B00GI13VYW|2.0|The debut album sounded fresh, but this is just more of the same and it doesn't have the same impact.<br />After the initial listen, I made myself play it again a couple times and both times I didn't make it through the whole record; just couldn't make myself do it.  That's sad.<br /><br />Hope he isn't a one-trick-pony.
B00FKAA3MA|5.0|The Marshall Mathers LP2 (Deluxe EX) is a hot/ great cd to have in your collection. If your an Eminem fan..........you'll like this one.
B00CNQ7CRI|5.0|Who doesn't love Bridget Jones? So great to catch up with her life - however bittersweet. Actually this is the first novel in the series I have actually read as previously I have watched the movie version. The book stayed true to the characters and you can imagine her (although with images of the movie) - she has such personality as do all the characters. Of course I look forward to the movie!
B008JFUP0I|5.0|Fast & Furious 6 (Steelbook) (Blu-ray + DVD + Digital HD with... is a great movie to have in your collection.
B004EWFUQY|5.0|I needed to lose that weight and I needed the incentive to lose it fast without starving. The Dukan Diet was an amazing change of lifestyle. I have always relied on too many carbs and not enough protein. Protein is much more filling and makes dieting a breeze. The recipes are easy to follow and the food is delicious. You can also purchase some of the products on line. I took off 18 pounds and have kept it off for 11 months. I have slipped and put a few of the pounds on but all I have to do is remember Thursday protein days or go back to square one to wean myself off the carbs and sugar and nighttime snacks that are my weakness and downfall. Its great even on a vacation as there is plenty of food you can eat without feeling guilty. Anyone needing a diet or going away and needing a kickstart should purchase this paperback and start the diet tomorrow! Thank you Dr. Dukan!
B008JFUUQ2|5.0|Love it, love it, love it.... we've watched this movie about 20x already!!! Mommy & daughter's favorite movie of all time!!!
B00G32OER4|4.0|My big burly construction worker of a husband cowered under the covers when watching this saying it was just too scary to watch.  I'm not quite as easy to scare and thought it was pretty scary/suspenseful in parts, but towards the end it just got a little been there-done that feeling for me but only a little and it was definitely worth the time to watch overall.<br />I also respected that they kept it clean, just an old fashioned scary movie.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Mr. King never fails to entertain and draw the reader to the characters whether the characters are friend or foe.  Each book promises entertainment and never a dull moment.  What a wonderful writer this man is.
B00683JK9K|2.0|I only played this a couple times.  I found it not user-friendly and kept getting frustrated at how to rotate the pieces around so I gave up.  I play these games to relax so if it's something that annoys me like that while playing, I just move on to the next game.  The puzzle scenes looked beautiful though and if you are a more patient person than I am, you might enjoy the game more.
159562015X|2.0|I had to use this product for an exercise for my company. I found it to be a waste of time and effort; it did not provide any major insights or revelations that would help me in my career.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|This was a great read! I recommend it highly. It was easy to read, but a complex story. Very entertaining!!
1439153663|5.0|This was an Excellent book. I couldn't put it down! I can't wait to read more books by this author!
B00005JPAO|5.0|So well done. Helen Mirren is an outstanding actress. I felt as if I were getting an intimate picture of Queen Elizabeth II and her life.
B007XNAQPG|5.0|Duran still got it: all you need is now!  After an almost complete disaster-er &#34;massacre&#34; of what lyrically and musically could have been a better album with another producer and the shelving of a 2nd &#34;comeback&#34; album with the original 5, Duran reconvened with a producer that gave them permission to sound like themselves and the results, in the studio and live, are reenergized and fantastic!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Awesome. It's cool like Temple Run, but this is really awesome. Love the graphics and love everything. Download this guys!!!
B00FB6FOEU|5.0|Joan gets real with what's on her mind, love the lyrics, and she rock n rolls with a punk attitude and it's been on repeat!!!
B00DJFIMW6|1.0|Come on. Let me play this without Internet. Also slow on Kindle. Doesn't work&hellip; I think. Duh. Promise I'll give you 5 stars if this can run offline.
014241011X|4.0|This is a story about witches...real witches...and real witches are not the things of fairy tales. Roald Dahl does an interesting job of balancing the grotesque with the funny to create a story for both children and adults. The story itself is entertaining and appropriate gruesome for both the young and the young at heart. The rhythm of the book makes it a wonderful read aloud story.  In fact, I found myself reading it aloud even with no one present to read aloud to!<br /><br />Like many of Dahl's books, The Witches is illustrated by Quentin Blake. Blake's illustrations (line drawings) are quite simyply fantastic in bringing the witches to life on the page. The witches are both quirky and fearsome to match Dahl's writing.<br />If you are a fan of Dahl's other works,<br /><br />I would recommend The Witches as a good bedtime read for slightly older children or a good mid-afternoon over hot chocolate read for those who are a little younger.
B000E8QVWY|5.0|I think that Joaquin Phoenix did an excellent job on his performance of Johnny Cash, and Reese Witherspoon was an excellent choice as June Carter I love this movie, I will watch it over and over again.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love this game it is relaxing and challenging. I play it on every device. I love it when I make it to another level.
0440246318|1.0|I've read several Jack Reacher books and this one was terrible. The plot was incredibly slow. As I read I was hoping that it would pick up steam but it never did. Save your money on this one.
B003R0MF5S|4.0|The 3rd season was way better that's when it hits chuck's peak climax. Overall best tv series I have seen in years.
B004CFAWK2|5.0|I have read this before, but I do love to get lost in the story of the Whistle Stop Cafe, So beautifully crafted with characters so real, I believe that I know them all and it will remain with you long after the final chapter.  Don't miss it!  One could be taken into a tale, a yarn, a legend or just plain history , but it is worth the price of admission.
B00BUT5I84|2.0|Only 2 good songs on this whole cd not worth getting the CD at all. But those 2 song just might be there best.
B000B8QEYC|5.0|It took me many years to discover Enya, so it is fitting that I found this particular CD and Enya to be just wonderful.  Perhaps there was a reason for my delay, perhaps I would not have appreciated this music when I was  younger!  So, if yoiu , like me, ae not familiar with the music, or a fan of Enya... give this a chance.  Simply lovely.
B00ABKGG0C|5.0|When I first started this book, it seemed like a copy of the kingkiller chronicle. But as I got through I realised how wrong that initial thought was. Sure, the narration device is the same, but blood song is fantastic in its own way. A must read for fantasy lovers.
B00BD99JMW|3.0|I liked the story because I was already in love with the characters.  I didn't love the narrator switch between paragraphs and the storyline felt rushed through much of the book.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|I LOVED THIS BOOK I COULDN'T STOP READING IT! AUGGIE IS SO INSPIRATIONAL ! I LOVED THE DIFFERENT POINT OF VIEWS!
B005J3IEZQ|5.0|A great insight into the person who changed the way we engaged with computers. A very balanced view of what made this man tick.
B004DK5CW4|5.0|A favorite story and a superb movie that includes quality performances and excellent cinematography.  My family enjoys watching it often so it was well worth the cost to make it a permanent part of our DVD library.
B003K1EYM6|1.0|Did not work. Even apple tech support could not figure out why. Don't waist your time and money on this.
B00005JMCN|5.0|This is just one of my favorite films.  I'm working on replacing those loaned out and not returned and building my DVD library with classic movies I enjoy seeing more than once.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I got this game because I kept hearing how much fun it was and I thought...sure. Well, it is fun. I just hats when I got to one point I had to wait so long before it would let me play.
B00B5HQLMI|4.0|Not a avid fan of this genre, but found the story line of an aging 007 and another of his co-star a novel approach to this action series.  Daniel Craig still has it going on and is the best 007 since Sean Connery, IMHO.  Not a bad way to send time while waiting for football games to be over.
1476729085|5.0|Graeme Simsion is a clever writer and I LOVED this book.  It charmed me, humored me, and left me thinking that all women will see something about all men in the character of Don and all men should read it to see something of themselves in Don.  As much as I wanted to see Don undergo change through his relationship with Rosie, it was perfect that the writer kept him in character through to the end.  Bravo!  It was a great read.
B00FKAA3MA|5.0|I love it! Great album. Usually you only get a few good songs on a disc, but I enjoy listening to EVERY song on this disc. Eminem has done it again!
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|This product is AWESOME.  It was literally as easy as plugging it in and it worked- no difficulties.<br />It does a great job streaming whatever is on my Chrome browser to my TV.<br />I'd strongly recommend it to anyone remotely considering streaming TV options and for a 1 time payment of $35 it far exceeds the monthly streaming choices.
B008NMT684|5.0|My son absolutely loves this app!!! It was well worth getting! I'm thinking about buying more puzzles for him to do! He kept telling me at first he couldn't do them and now he's doing them with his eyes closed, well almost!
B0063M22QO|3.0|The game is too easy, not much of a challenge. I am a Mahjong lover so I would like it to be more challenging. It plays very well.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|I love the bigger drawing screen! It makes drawing much easier! Now if I could find people to actually play the game with me I'd be happier!!!
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|This one is more challenging and I like that. I  don't like advertisements obscuring the game but it is a good game.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|The only thing I really don't like about Facebook and the app on the kindle is that it doesn't give me more recent updates and when it does it's the first few and then it goes back to two days ago! I do enjoy though being able to get on Facebook with the kindle and let my phone charge!
B00B5HQL50|4.0|I like what they did with the story arc, the characters are compelling and the action has merit to it, not simply stopping bad guys. The villain is great too. Definitely recommend it.
B004SOR4H6|5.0|I love to tweet! I'm glad that I can do this on my kindle and my phone!! When the phone is on he charger I get on with my kindle and it's bigger for me to read and follow what's going on!
B00B0LPYXG|2.0|A film about drugs and drug abuse masked as a film about an airplane pilot. I'll choose Requiem for a Dream any day over this movie.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|So colorful!  It's very challenging on some of the levels.  Game does works well on my Kindle Fire HD.  I felt I had to &#34;buy my way out&#34; of a couple of levels, after about 20 tries.  Not my favorite match 3 game.
B007ZGBZHE|5.0|Preston and Child never fail to deliver. Pendergrast in all his glory leads the reader through another adventure. Definitely worth reading.
B008K6HN8I|2.0|Can't make it work.  I need more info to figure out how to use.  I would like to be able to make it work.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|it's fun and enjoyable and very challenging so I like it--however I don't like the fact that you have to pay to go on
B004SBX112|5.0|It's a lot of fun on my Kindle Fire HD.  The &#34;Abra-ca-dabra&#34; level is the most challenging; it's in the 3rd tier of the game.
B003RV43X4|5.0|Our family enjoyed this movie (we have two teenage boys).  We saw it in the theater first, but wanted to see it again once the second film came out.  We like a lot of the actors in this movie.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|I LOVE THIS GAME. For everyone who gives it a 1,2,or 3 star are stupid. This is good for kids and I like it to. It is very cute.
B00BSB2AE4|5.0|I am now frightened. She exposed the bad parts of my mental makeup. Why? I was battling those demons just fine until you let them out . Now everyone will know what I'm like and what's wrong with me. My delusional life is shattered. Thank you for writing this beautiful and honest look into our minds.
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|I liked it on Facebook and it keeps getting better every step of the way! I can't stop playing! It's addicting!
B000FA675C|2.0|I think this book was way over-rated.  I found it tedious and thought that it should have ended about 10 times with any of the mini climaxes, just to be disappointed with yet another continuance.  Boring.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is fun there has been nothing wrong with it so far I play mostly everyday including my niece who is four she loves it. This game is good for road trip or to just relax
B003UMW66Q|5.0|I know this movie is aim for little kids but I love this movie. I love that its clean and fun. It doesn't try to be anything else. This was the best one. It was a great ending. Everybdy did an amazing job. My favorite song is can I have this dance.
B00003CXRM|5.0|Great movie and soundtrack.  George looney shows his comedic side and another first rate performances by john goodman thoroughly recommended
B00FWPWNKS|4.0|This is  truly a fun game , I enjoy playing for hours. It's great because each level is a little more challenging , this game offers three modes of play with 60 levels, a must have game !
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|I really like this game but on my Kindle many of the items in the hidden objects scenes are almost too small to see.  Some are impossible to see.  Otherwise the colors are nice, graphics excellent, and the music not too intrusive.
B00BBI9WD6|5.0|I liked the first book a lot and really liked this one. I think it is well written. I'm looking forward to reading the rest in the series.
B000QE9ERK|5.0|This is a mystical and very stylish movie  by Roman Polanski, a real Master. The cast is superb, the performances of all actors are at their absolutely best. For those who like to enjoy a really  fine movie without any hidden agenda. Pure pleasure.
B00GI8AMI8|5.0|Davey's Mystery is one of the best games I've played since the new Fire Maple game came out.  I had to use my brain for this one.  There is no help or hints therefore I had to stop and think about things.  It's amazing how it comes together.  Don't get frustrated and remember to look at everything. I can say that now. I didn't follow my own advice and was at a standstill. Turned around on the balcony and holey moley, there it was! I hope Echo Lake Interactive continues with more games like this.
B00BWQW73E|5.0|One of the most interesting and exciting business books I've read. You come away with a huge amount of respect for Bezos, Amazon's innovative business approach and the company's customer-first spirit. You also get the message that customer-first often means employee-last. And, that it takes a particular kind of person to thrive at and enjoy employment at Amazon.
B0076DELIG|3.0|I couldn't remember reading it when my husband asked me for a critique about the book on a request from Amazon to review it.
B0042TV4IW|4.0|Engaging and interesting view into an particular era in English life. The story seems a bit ho-hum at the start, but the acting is good, and we are very quickly invested in what happens to these characters. Definitely worth tuning into!
B003G4W49C|5.0|This is such a good book!!! I've haven't been able to put the book down. I have to remind myself that the story is about a boy even though the complexities are so much like our world today in an adult situation. Loving it!!
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|This book follows his usual formula but is still well worth the read. As a sequel to Time to Kill it uses the characters to maximum effect,
0312853238|5.0|One of the first editions from the many republications of this book. I read the book just before I saw the movie and the book provides a lot of information the movie leaves out. I found this copy by sheer luck from Goodwill in Houston, TX. If you watched the movie already I recommend you read the original text, it is very good.
B00A4FOWYQ|5.0|love them for years and now that they have a real hit, just had to have this cd. plus ease of transaction made this even better
B008JFUQ3O|5.0|I want to thank all the people who made a review about this product based on taking their children to the movies....<br />Did you see that this said Blu-Ray+Digital HD with UltraViolet.<br />Yea so this review should be based about this Blu-Ray lady/sir.<br /><br />THIS IS NOT A MOVIE REVIEW SITE DORK!<br /><br />Thank you for NOT mentioning anything about the picture quality, the product quality it self, and if there is any extras that one can expect.  OH WAIT YOU DONT EVEN OWN IT!  So stop waisting time.<br /><br />Also thank you to all the grown people who gave this movie a 1 star as they are not pleased with the motion picture. Lets forget the part that this is for kids....<br /><br />I have seen this, I have seen the first one, this movie is for kids and it is pretty funny, again for KIDS.<br /><br />Nice reviews parents!!! real nice!!!  I missed the part where amazon.com turned into a movie rating site.
B00AALHW6Y|5.0|love this cd and another great transaction. heard a song from this at my nieces wedding and just had to have it
B00B4804KS|5.0|This 3D version of Jurassic Park is amazing! Its like watching a whole new movie compared to the original.  They really did a great job on the 3D conversion, it looks like it was filmed with 3D cameras. There is a great behind the scenes look at the work that went into the 3D conversion and also revitalizing the sound. I watch 3D blu Rays through my computer using a 27&#34; Asus 3D monitor with active shutter glasses, the display is superb!
B00EW9GQR6|3.0|This album is really just... ok at best. No big deal at all. The songs are not that great. Not worth the money.
B00A8MGLAI|4.0|This movie was pretty good. I watched a lot of the behind the scenes features and alot of work went into this, and it shows. I haven't read the book, which I knows is a very complicated storyline and the movie was hard to follow sometimes, but after the 2nd viewing I really liked this movie even more. Well done!
B00AECGQF2|4.0|My kids, especially my youngest (10 yrs old), have a lot of fun with this.  I've had it on my phone for a couple of months now, and he'll still play with it for up to 30 min at a time (and this is a kid who loves shoot-em-up and zombie games!).  An app that has staying power like that gets a good score in my book!
145162607X|3.0|This book was a disappointment to me. Queen Anne Neville came from the most powerful family of her time. Her father was, besides the King, the most powerful man in England. Her family helped the Yorkists come to power -- Edward IV was not expected to become King until later in life, but a battle killed his father before he could become crowned. I just expected more out of this book. Instead it was very pro-Woodville giving them this kind of power and hold over the other nobility at court and especially the King and his family. Her death was also just one big flop and poorly written. I got to the end and was like &#34;that's it???&#34; And the show that came from this book -- don't get me started!
B008Y212PI|5.0|This is a good game to turn to when I have to many thoughts roiling around in my head.  I have to concentrate on the numbers, so it pushes all else out and kind of &#34;clears&#34; me.  I'm also okay with doing the pictures over and over again (there are quite a few).
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|To the trained legal eye Grisham plays fast and loose with evidentiary and procedural rulings and maneuverings but that is easily overlooked and in fact enjoyed.  Sycamore Row is Grisham's triumphant return to Jake Brigance and Ford County. An easy and entertaining read.
B00B5HQLMI|5.0|Both interesting and realistic special effects. Craig could be the best Bond to date. The changing of the guard was carried out with class.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I saw the movie first, Movie was done well, but I really didn't like the killing.<br />The book was good and made it make more sense. Book is really well written.
B0014ESMCY|5.0|I'm not a student of jazz music, but I know what I like -- and I really like this album.  One of my go-to works when I need to get started on producing documentation at work.
0679809015|5.0|GREAT THIS IS FOR MY GRAND SON FOR CHRISTMAS  THIS IS HIGH QUALITY AND ALSO FAST SHIPPING HE WILL  LOVE IT
B00AZMFJYA|5.0|My wife is a Star Trek nut.  Besides I like the actors and the direction of these last two movies have been excellent.
B004UID2LC|5.0|GREAT THIS IS FOR MY GRAND SON FOR CHRISTMAS  THIS IS HIGH QUALITY AND ALSO FAST SHIPPING HE WILL  LOVE IT
B009NG1Q96|5.0|I love how you start to think that everything is going to go well but then the book takes an enormous turn and throws you off track can't wait for the last book; the one
B001DCZ4IW|5.0|Movie is a cult classic -- have loved it since first seeing it years ago. Plus it has a soundtrack by Cat Stevens.
B005DJREGQ|4.0|The writers of this show are extremely talented.  The plot of the show is plausible and the characters are well fleshed out.  Even the evil cheerleaders are not just evil cardboard cutouts.  Some of the writing is a little over the top but for the most part it is a great watch.  The Asian Mafia stuff is simply incredible.  The thing that kills me is that they write this stuff in such a manner that no parent in their right mind would ever let their target audience watch it.  That is sad because it is so funny and so well written.  I would NEVER let my child watch it.  It is FULL of underage drinking, teen sex, bleeped F words, bullying, and other horrible non role model type activities.  I guess to be on MTV you have to be shocking and sensational.  I will continue to watch it on my own time and when my kids are not around.  I have already completed everything on prime and have started to DVR the new stuff.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I found the trilogy to be spectacular. For all readers, it was easy to find a character one could relate. I recommend this series!!
0761169431|5.0|This book is amazing. My kids went crazy doing origami (aditional- Star Wars Origami) It´s great, it came with a lot of pre designed papers in order to do some designs. I´ll recomend.
1455525839|5.0|As usual, Preston and Child have written the perfect book with the perfect main character. This one also has a neat twist involving other great writers.
0307474259|4.0|I actually have not read it but my wife has. She picked it up when it arrived and has been cruising through it. We have implemented the ideas contained herein and I have lost 40lbs in 10 weeks. It works for us.
B005H0IW6W|2.0|This album is SO SADLY drenched in autotune that I find it unbearable to listen to! Michael says his favorite Christmas album has always been Bing Crosbys White Christmas, and who would disagree that the pure honesty of that album is what makes it great. Mr, Buble however will only be remembered by his eras misguided belief that perfection is somehow flattering. Truly sad when a gifted singer leaves the vocal booth and the engineers take over ruining and altering the brilliance of truth and honesty!
B00FEMJF6O|3.0|It is not all that. But the graphics are ok it's a game for ppl that probably like Farmville and those types of games.
B00G9U7NEQ|4.0|It was good, not as good as the first Monsters Inc., movie, but good.  The movie is entirely placed when the monsters were in school.  The quality is awesome and it's worth watching, but be prepared for an understated plot.  I would like to have seen more ties to their work after school and getting hired.  This flew by in about a 30 second window in this movie.
B00BD99JMW|1.0|Such a disappointment.  The story took such a turn from the progress of the first two novels.  I'm not just talking about the ending, just all of it.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|This book captured my interest from the first page. The ending was very fitting and a good solution. I highly recommend this book.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Adore this game!! its a lot of fun, especially at the doctors waiting. and my daughter loves it! happy they made it for the kindle.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Loved this one! Went very well after the first one. Love love love the story line. Couldn't stop reading it!!
B000QRIGLC|5.0|We, as American citizens, should read more of these eyewitness accounts of what is really happening in the middle east and not from the perspective of a journalist; but from an American who fought the battle. We should encourage these brave men to share what they have learned so that we can share our tears, respect and thank them for their service.<br /><br />Our WWII, Korean, and Vietnam Vets were silent when they returned from the front lines. And us, their family and friends, were silent too not knowing what to say or how to thank them.
B004X6PRO6|5.0|one of the best books I've ever read. A modern classic and call for change. This book is a real eye opener about the possible conditions in North Korea. A well written must read.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|Haha couldn't think of anything else's to put in my title... this game is way better than the first one! So much more dynamics to it then it's predecessor. Strongly recommend.
0375842209|5.0|Wonderful story!  I love it and the writing is superb, simple, and yet so very graphic.  It was an interesting read and the thought process of the writer is just wonderful to think about as it unfolds.
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|This game is awesome<br />I play it all the time<br />I keep on earning coins<br />I have to writethis review
B009VSW15Y|5.0|Love it and use it all the time. I take it on vacation with me and send e-mail pictures to friends and family.
B00BD99JMW|3.0|The first two books of the series were simply awesome, but this one left me wanting more. Obviously if you read Divergent you wil have to read Allegiant to know what happens to Tris and Tobias, and the ending is very suprising, and on my opinion it was perfect for this story, but there is not much action, kind of monotone. Still, READ IT!
B00CW6DAKC|1.0|I Can't play this on my kindle fire hd it says I need to download an update and when I go to the.kindle app thing there is.none. I don't know what to do
B0000549B0|5.0|It is my dad's favorite movie.  Very glad that I was able to find it.  It is nice to have some of these &#34;classical&#34; CD's to view time to time.
B00FEMJF6O|4.0|I've this game. I would recommend to family. Fast fun moves at a pace I can keep at. Even kids would love it.
0316322407|5.0|As the mother of two daughters and grandmother of two girls,&#34;I am Malala&#34; , is both inspiring and courageous.<br />Her miraculous recovery and the support of her wonderful family is so encouraging.<br />How fortunate we are to have Malala as an awe inspiring role model.
1781162646|5.0|Wow. Stephen King is back. This was a great read.  Almost as good as The Stand.  Too bad he doesn't put this on kindle and the iPad or at least add a Large Print version.  You must go to a bookstore if you can find one left.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|I must admit I gave up on King over a decade ago, but a sequel to The Shining grabbed my interest. I found it to be a page-turner and I really did like it a lot. I found myself remembering why I liked him so many years ago in my youth.
B003H4I4JU|5.0|Thoroughly enjoyable and engaging to the end.  I am 70% through the next book now, and am happy I discovered Mr. Card's novels.
B000JIHP88|3.0|The product itself is very cute, it attaches to the crib well, and my son enjoys watching it.  Though, I have had it for less than a month and used it only 4 times and it is already broken.  The leaves do not go up and down and the animals do not spin all the time.  I have to reset it by turning it off and on a few times hoping it will catch and work properly.  The music is also soft and hard to hear.  I would only recommend this product if it was reliable and easy to hear.
159184617X|3.0|The start of the book is quite good - nice to get an insight into Jony's early days - and that's good investigative journalism.<br />I felt however, that as the book progressed it became less and less interesting, with fairly little was shared regarding his most recent years at Apple. Nothing new - just stuff available in various other sources like patents or promotional videos.<br /><br />I was however, let down by something else.<br /><br />Leander's site published this:<br />[...]<br /><br />Is this really newsworthy and worth even blogging about?<br />It's hype for hype's sake and makes me take everything that's written in the book with a pinch of salt.
B000WOT41K|5.0|I love this collection, but then, I've been a fan of The Cranberries since 1993. It's got the best songs from their other albums, and I noticed some I had never heard before. I don't know if those were new or just from the one album I never bought.
B00008MLSH|3.0|Maybe 3.5 stars, for the basic quality of the voice is lovely -- it has a nice quick vibrato and a pleasant warmth in the middle to upper-middle of its range -- but as other reviewers have commented, there is a sameness to the items in this recital that make it less compelling than debut recitals by singers like Rysanek and Price.  I have seen Netrebko twice in live transmissions from the Met, and she's a fine natural actress (I saw her as Elvira in \\"Puritani\\" and as Gounod's Juliet) and the voice was in good condition, but here, about four years earlier in her career, her coloratura singing is a bit approximate even though she seems to be singing carefully (at the end of \\"Non mi dir\\" and in the florid sections of Lucia's first aria and cabaletta).  The top of her voice can get a bit shrill, but that could be an artifact of the recording.  Netrebko was 32 when this recording was made -- the reviews of her performances since have been positive, and she made a nice recording of Russian arias, so she grew as a singer.  If you want to hear her in better voice, I recommend the Russian album -- texts and translations are provided, so you don't need to worry about the unfamiliar material and language.
B004ZZS4CC|4.0|A really heartbreaking story, but interesting to see how Jaycee rises above her situation to become a wonderful person.  I would recommend this book.
B000GCFBQU|3.0|I confess...I'm not a big fan of literary fiction, but a friends recommendation got me to read this one. What I liked:  good writing, beautiful scene setting, and most of all, Christianity WASN'T trashed, ridiculed, or dismissed. This is really a book about grief and people----a minister and his small child---coping with a death.<br /><br />What I didn't like: author intrusion into the story. Yet this is often the case in literary genre. The writer inserts him/herself into the story, and thus stands in the way of reader bonding with characters. The author &#34;tells&#34; me the story, I prefer to be &#34;shown&#34; the story via the characters viewpoint in the book. And yet Ms Strout is a seasoned writer, with excellent crafting skills. However this literary device of omniscient author puts me off the genre. LM
B00338QENI|5.0|This was the most interesting book I have read in a long, long time.  It is full of history that most people, I believe, have never been privy to.  Henrietta's story is well worth taking the time to read.  In fact, I have read it twice.
B00BSBR9N6|4.0|An intriguing love story!  Hard to maintain a narrative by someone with Asperger's syndrome who has many aspects that make him more like an idiot savant--but the author has done an excellent job.  Anxious to see this made into a movie!  Rosie is going to be hard to cast--but it's a pivotal role and what makes the book such a delightful read
B000FCKPHG|4.0|It was very interesting, informative and lots of food for thought.  I teach 5th graders, so I found very helpful info here.
B001N3GUIE|5.0|Absolutely one of the best science-fiction horror movies ever made.  The series of &#34;Star Wars&#34; and &#34;Star Trek&#34; movies wouldn't have been possible without this classic first--and one wonders really if any of its pseudo-imitators truly compare.  And the love story--what a team of Leslie Nielsen and Anne Francis!
B007IXWKUK|4.0|I really enjoyed reading this trilogy --- I even surprised myself -- not my usual read -- but kept me wondering what would happen next --- much more meat tot he story than I had anticipated.
B001XUJMZK|5.0|One of the best films, ever. Regardless of what you think of Mel Gibson, this movie is in the top 25 of all time for me.
B007THA4FI|2.0|I did not finish this book -- I was so disappointed --- was expecting more from J K Rowling.  Don't understand what happened with this one.
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|would give it 3.5 - readable work about 2 young people battling cancer, and figuring out what to do with love that probably doesnt have a chance in hell to last.  characters are clever, somewhat heroic.
B001XRLWPQ|5.0|I've waited for some time to buy this I'm so happy I can watch it on dvd  now I love the commentary on these discs
B00ECL7ZJ2|4.0|It's hard to believe that it was 43 years ago this December that Fanny released their debut album. Long considered the premiere all-female band, everyone from The Runaways to the GoGo's and the Bangles to L7 and The Donnas have persued their crowns as the Queens of Rock & Roll. However, to date, no one has come close to dethroning them and winning that prize.<br />  Flash forward to 2013. The hype over the Haim sisters ~ Este, Danielle and Alana ~ has been intense. Now, with their major label release DAYS ARE GONE, we all get to see if the goods match the gossip.<br />  I, for one, almost never buy an album sight unseen. In the old days (read: when vinyl was still king!), I had a hard and fast rule of hearing at least four cuts before any purchase was made. I've since loosened up...now it's just one or two. That said, there was something about HAIM that just seemed...cool. And in one of the weakest years for new music in recent memory, taking a chance on something new seemed like a no-brainer.<br />  Gotta say....I'm glad I did! DAYS ARE GONE is one of the strongest, most enjoyable, debuts in recent memory. Full of flavors and vibes that bring to mind everyone from Kate Bush, Sarah McLachlan and Teena Marie to Peter Gabriel, Roxy Music, Prince and mid-to-late 80's Stevie Nicks, the band still remains absolutely themselves. This is, indeed, a group to keep an eye on!<br />  Things start out strong with the atmospheric \\"Falling.\\" The lovely harmonies wash over an ecconomical arrangement that ebbs and flows, drawing the listener in deeper and deeper. Toss in introspective lyrics (\\"I hear the voices and they're calling/For me now (I know)/That nothing's gonna wake me now/'Cause I'm a slave to the sound\\") and you have a real winner. Nice way to kick things off!<br />  Equally as strong is \\"Forever.\\" With it's 80's dance groove and sultry lead vocal, Teena Marie's innate ability to meld pop, rock and R&B together comes to mind. The cut is insanely catchy, but there's also a real depth to it as well. And I love the \\"Edge of Seventeen\\" guitars! Another real gem.<br />  Even with it's Eagles-esque opening guitar riff, it's another 70's super-group that \\"The Wire\\" brings to mind. With it's punchy rock arrangement and shared lead vocals, the Los Angeles Times was right on the money when they compared the song to classic Fleetwood Mac. DAYS ARE GONE's most straight on rock track, this is a sound HAIM would be wise to persue on future releases.<br />  \\"If I Could Change Your Mind\\" has a similar arrangement to both \\"Falling\\" and \\"Forever\\", albeit with a slightly more percussive edge. A strong lead vocal (that brings to mind a more rocking Sarah McLachlan) is the cut's main focal point, but until each of the ladies' take on lead vocals becomes more clear, it might be wise to note who's handling the actual lead on any given track. Still, very cool.<br />  There's a gauzy groove-meets-surf vibe on \\"Honey And I\\" that's totally hypnotic. The instrumentation bops along, while the lead and harmony vocals brilliantly play tag with each other. Thoughtful lyrics (\\"This song can't be played alone/It was made to be played with my/Honey and I\\") cap things off. Building up steam (and intensity) by song's end, it's clear this is another winner!<br />  \\"Don't Save Me\\" is sort of \\"Kate Bush-meets-Heart, by way of Cyndi Lauper\\", but done in an equally organic HAIM vibe. One of the great things about HAIM is the fact that their sterling vocals are always up front and center, aided and abetted by the instrumentation, but never overpowered or, even worse, buried by it (A frequent problem in much of today's current brand of pop music). \\"Don't Save Me\\" is a pitch-perfect example of this important (but all-too-often overlooked) quality.<br />  Another favorite is the Tom Tom Club-flavored title track. There's something almost cinematic about \\"Days Are Gone\\", in both a cartoon and art house way....I LOVE this song! There's not a whole lot to the arrangement, but that's O.K. ~ the minimal instrumentation just allows the vocals, all layered and quirky, to shine even more! An absolutely stunning cut.<br />  In less talented hands, the dissonant \\"My Song 5\\" might come across as strident and artsy for art's sake, but that's not the case here. With it's odd vaudeville-meets-early-horror movie groove, this cut fits right into the overall vibe, adding yet another color to HAIM's pallet. In fact, it provides the perfect balancing act to a lot of the other songs found on D.A.G. So far out it's in, this one's a keeper!<br />  Things take another nice turn on \\"Go Slow.\\" A gorgeous ballad that dances along, I SO could have seen Kate Bush singing this twenty years ago! Killer lyrics (\\"'Cause you took away all my young life/And I hate who I've become/From your heat now\\") and mesmerizing instrumentation coalesce into a sound and style that is both dazzling and dynamic. Wow! That's all I can say....just....WOW!<br />  There's an intensity to \\"Let Me Go\\" that pounds away at the listener's senses, until the almost-hypnotic tribal beats and surf guitar riffs suck you down into a whirlpool of tunefulness. I swear, a big part of HAIM's charm is that a lot of their stuff shouldn't work...and yet it does! Another strong cut.<br />  The disc wraps up with another favorite, the spirited \\"Running If You Call My Name.\\" A shimmering arrangement perfectly cushions the buoyant vocals, lovingly layered one over the other. As with \\"Go Slow\\", there's a push-and-pull vibe going on here, one that lulls you, but never, ever bores you. One of my favorites cuts, not only off of DAYS ARE GONE, but of 2013, period!<br />  So where do the sisters Haim go from here? Well, they certainly need to find a way to more strongly differentiate their three individual voices. And I would love to see more straight ahead rock, ala \\"The Wire.\\" But for the most part, I'm pretty sure it's safe to say that the world is HAIM's oyster. One thing for sure....somewhere, June & Jean Millington, Alice de Buhr and Nickey Barclay are smiling, knowing it was all worth it! (As with all my reviews, I'm giving the disc an extra half a star for including the lyrics).at's O.K. ~ the minimal instrumentation just allows the vocals, all layered and quirky, to shine even more!

B00A27X972|5.0|I began The Humans by Haig expecting a light, fun sci fi story. It is so much more! I find this an amazinglook at the human condition. We are so frail and funny and fraught with problems. We are often naive and usually self-centered. But we humans also express love in sweet personal ways as well as through our literature. It's easy to forget how important poetry is and how accurately it captures our emotions.Ahh, Emily Dickinson. Haig's story pulls all this together in a truly creative way. A great read.Thank you, Matt. I'm off to start another of your books.
B0002HZLWI|5.0|Superb quality - these blocks look nice, feel nice, and fit together beautifully.  They are used by the kids to create all kinds of buildings and environments and used in conjunction with many of their other toys, ranging from plastic army men, to dolls and transformers.  They are somewhat expensive, but will last a lifetime.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Awesome, works perfect with Netflix and youtube and any other app that allow its.  Very high definition and fast to load
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Addictive .... my sister and daughter talked about it ...I couldn't be bothered .... then I tried it .... wow!
B003O86FMW|5.0|My husband didn't like the first movie because they kill the kids. I think the second one will be a bit more to his liking :)
B00ARHAAZ6|5.0|I wasn't aware that this was going to be a trilogy when I'd purchased the book.  I'm usually wary to start a series with out some feedback. but this is all a very pleasant surprised as I enjoyed this book very much.  it's exciting and packed with really well written action.  the world building and character development is also very well done.  I really can't wait for the next installment! it's like reading a comic book and watching the movie at the same time.
B005PK56TA|5.0|Excellent show, very well done season 1.  I found the show to be the right amount of creepy.  I saw season 2 and am watching season 3, so far season 1 is my favorite.
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|So far so good for this type of game.  As you go along you will have to wait along time to get items unless you spend real money.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|I heard from lots of people and media that this game was &quot;addicting&quot;- while i wouldnt go quite that far, it has become a game i cant wait to play. The challenges are equally fun and difficult. And that song!
B0032UYFA6|5.0|This is probably the best series I've seen since &#34;The Wire.&#34;  The writing is never predictable; I'm constantly in suspense.
B00CKJ2KK2|5.0|perfect game, thank you gameloft, I really enjoyed it. Nice gameplay. Please, add offline missions when upgrade and give us chance to buy guns with coins.
B0064X7FVE|4.0|Temperature &amp; weather conditions when you open app.<br /><br />Radar let's you see weather around you ,when changing weather is coming to you.  Easy to use &amp; read
B00ESNE696|5.0|The most excellent show on TV. Well acted and directed.....always unpredictable. I couldn't buy the most recent episode on Amazon as it wasn't available the next day after the airing as it usually is.....VERY FRUSTRATING!! I had to view it on ITUNES. Not sure what's going on there, but it will be very disappointing if I have to now rent episodes from ITunes and not Amazon.......?????
B00C5R7B0I|5.0|I haven't finished the book yet but this author never disappoints me. I have read most  all of her books.
B00CNQ7HAU|4.0|As usual, the author's writing is flawless. Trouble by some minor glitches, but loved the story. Wonderful characters. Great to see Jake, Lucius. Harry Rex and Ozzie again. Hope it's not the last. FER
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|I loved this book. One of the best he's done, and I've read all of them. My brother in law reads Grisham and I couldn't wait to send it to him to enjoy.
B00AEFY5TI|5.0|Got this for my granddaughter and she along with my grandson loved it..the movie was brand new and in great condition
B003PJ6UHA|5.0|You don't have to accept new ideas but it pays to entertain them, digest them, and be  informed and pensive for them. This book is worth the read.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Fun, fun, fun!  Candy crush saga is a good way to pass a few minutes.  It can be frustrating some times but I always find myself going back to play again.
B00ENXBUR2|3.0|I won't review the Movie here. There's plenty of that already here and other sites. I will talk about the Collector's Edition set though.<br /><br />It comes in quite a large S shield tin.  Which is pretty cool.  The  included plexi-glass stand is disappointing.  The stand base is shaped like the superman shield pentagon, and has a slot for the support arm. However the slot is a little too small for the rectangular peg on the arm, and as such when I inserted it in it created stress marks on the base. Small ones mind you, but they were there.<br /><br />Aside from the base you get the 4 discs in a opening S shield cardboard case. It flowers out to reveal all four discs. 3D, Blu Ray, DVD/Ultra Violet, and the Special Features disc.<br /><br />All in all its a nice set, but unfortunately not as great as it could be.  Compared to \\"The Dark Knight Rises: Limited Edition Bat Cowl\\" set with the broken cowl stand its just not quite there. And even less so if you compare it with the superb Dark Knight Trilogy: Ultimate Collector's Edition.<br /><br />Now, for $39.99 its a good deal.  (Price I paid for my pre-order) anything over $46, and you aren't getting your money's worth in terms of physical extras. The tin is nice, but its just not as good as it could be. And there's really nothing else in the box.<br /><br />All in all, just o.k.  Look for deep discounts.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|For the first time I bought the audio version. I was so grateful as it made this story even more beautiful. I love this book
B00CSJYYO4|4.0|What I liked the most was the message behind the story and  recognizing the characters from the bible. I really enjoyed reading it.
B00EY8BRGU|5.0|Good entertainment and good plot would definitely rewatch this again in the future I would highly recommend this movie !
1439156816|4.0|A must read for writers. It's always fascinating to get into the head of one of the most successful writers out there. I'll definitely read again.
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|It's very temperamental. Advanced tech users should be able to get it to work, but it's still annoying, people who aren't so keen on technology will have many issues using it.<br /><br />Additionally, you cannot connect to it via a device physically connected to the router, you must connect via WIFI.
B008Y7N7JW|4.0|Good movie.  Definitley worth watching.  I highly recommend reading the book first.  It would fill in some of the pieces.
B009JZSC9S|5.0|this show keeps you on your feet leaving you wondering what to expect the next go around! Must watch on Prime!!
B00EQRPFGC|5.0|The lyrics of this song are so real and down to earth, I imagine my sweetheart singing them to me every time I hear it and the melody is just beautiful!  I'm a romantic, what can I say!
B0027ZCQ4E|5.0|Great thriller! Loved it from start to finish.  Saw it years ago in the theater and it is just as compelling now.
B00EA8UEZ4|5.0|Loved this book so much I didn't want it to end. DU and Your Immortal Reality were absolutely fantastic but this was my faviourite. I felt I had a friend (holy spirit) supporting me through my forgiveness lessons and for first time I have started to feel free of the ego. I am eternally grateful to Gary, Arten and Pursah. I hope there are more books to come as they really are life changing. Without all three books there is no way I would be able to live and practice the course the way I do today. THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU!!!!!!!!
B0002TJGQS|4.0|These same batteries cost $8 for a single on at Walmart... much better deal here.<br /><br />Lessons learned from this purchase: Check what batteries the scale needs before purchase and ALWAYS check amazon first.
B00E9P957Q|3.0|Disappointing after the three prior reissue box sets, simply each disc in a slipcase. The music everyone knows, so this is merely a way to update and consolidate your jewel-cased collection.
B004JN1D2I|5.0|I bought the e-books specifically to use the X-Ray feature of my Kindle Paperwhite. I've already read (and loved them) and I'm watching the HBO series, and the X-Ray Feature really helps with recall, what's next, and who they're connected to.
B007IXWKUK|2.0|just a soap opera with lots of sex...not a literary piece of work!  Don't bother unless you just want to read about sex and positions.
B005BRS8Z6|5.0|I now own this book in both actual book and e-book formats. It is a truly excellent guide to a better life.
B00CZ1TMUQ|5.0|Can &#34;Perhaps Love&#34; possibly surpass &#34;Together&#34;?  Yes it can and yes it does!  Jonathan is Jonathan, of course, but on this album, Charlotte's voice has matured and is even better than on &#34;Together.&#34;
B007VDN1PA|4.0|Very easy to use, although it took me about 10 minutes to figure out why my notebook was not detecting the unit when I plugged it to the USB port (but that's just because I did not want to read the guide).<br />In the menu in the small LCD, you have to select the USB icon and then click on 'enter' so that the device communicates with the computer and gets detected as an external drive.
B00DSTBMMU|3.0|I started following Sheryl Crow from the very first notes of &#34;Leaving Las Vegas&#34;.  I fell in love with her during 2004's LP &#34;Cmon, Cmon.&#34;  I love the strength that seems to flow from songs like &#34;Steve McQueen&#34;, &#34;Hole In My Pocket&#34;, and even &#34;Gasoline&#34;.  With this latest effort, her so-called &#34;country album&#34;, Crow seems to over-reaching in some areas, and cowering in others.  Her vocal range (which I thought she knew) gets totally overextended into screechy, &#34;diva&#34; territory (especially on songs like &#34;Give It To Me&#34;).  On that track, as well as &#34;Waterproof Mascara&#34;, &#34;Homesick&#34; and &#34;Stay at Home Mother&#34;, Crow seems to want to portray country women as weak, over-emotional and lost without a man.  This is not the Sheryl Crow I'm used to.<br /><br />That being said, she knocks it out the park with &#34;Best Of Times&#34;, the Dolly Parton-esque &#34;Homecoming Queen&#34; and &#34;Callin' Me When I'm Lonely&#34;.  The rest of album, while musically tight, is unfortunately ripe with cliches, especially on tracks like &#34;Easy&#34;, &#34;We Ought To Be Drinkin'&#34; and &#34;Nobody's Business&#34;.<br /><br />Is the album palatable? Sure.  But if it were playing in a grocery store, no one would pay much attention.  There's very little on this LP to make a Sheryl Crow fan sit up and say, &#34;Hell Yeah, you go girl!&#34;  Sheryl my dear, get back into rockin'!
B00DHKKN6Q|4.0|Great game .love it play it all the time. Love bubble blaze. Tell everyone to get this game .You will love to play it
B000JMKQX0|4.0|This work is a completely different look at the ZA genre, as has been said over and over. The quality of the writing gives it 4) Stars IMO.  Much has been written in this genre, but this is a different twist and worth reading if you are a serious zombie fan.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This book is a must for Women or Men... This book will take you on journey you wont' want to come back from.
B007WOFXAO|5.0|I own the greatest hits cd, but will say that this is the better way of getting to know the music of the America. The hits are all t here...and at this price it's a great alternative to the greatest hits cd. I think in hindsight I paid about the same for both, and this way I got more music. There is a lot more to discover here though than the greatest hits cd suggests. They come in replica album sleeves, which is great for my new collection (of replica covers). But this is a great way for the casual fan to get the hits and the more devoted fans to learn more about the great music this group put out. I highly recommend this, and at this price, you really can't lose.
B00FEMJF6O|4.0|Love this game. I haven't had any problems on my Kindle Fire. I like that you can play and not have to rely completely on friends or neighbors. Just takes a little time.
B00AZMFK3K|3.0|The movie is good,  But unfortunately the story line just isn't as engaging as the first one, trying to tie in a book story line about the Dreadnought , a movie story line about a huge adversary for Kirk, the under mining of Starfleet etc is too much.  I find the Uhura/Spock subject to be much too dramatized.
B009LDCZDC|5.0|Absolutely riveting.  Every episode builds on the last and the final episode leaves you waiting for more!  The character development is stunning and the plot line is smart.  I've already started season 3 (we got Showtime so we could watch it right away!).  Seriously a thrill every episode.  Worth the money!
B001TH16DI|5.0|Star Trek Original group, Original Movies what Better.  The packaging and Blu Ray are excellent nice and clean, worth the price paid
B003O86FMW|5.0|Could not put it down - a thrilling ride the whole way through.  The characters are well developed and I really enjoyed the story-line.  It set up the third book very well and I cannot wait to see the movie!
B00GH4RKYM|1.0|This movie is nothing close to Superman in any known form, The original Christopher Reeves Movie is by far better than this movie, even Superman II&III even though campy and cheesey they at least were closer to what the original stories are.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I love Sylvia day!  I think she has a way with making a great story line!  It is very easy to get caught up in the book!
B00G32QIEG|3.0|It's a funny movie, it has its moments, nothing to smart, nothing too stupid just some good laughs, not needed sex or naked scenes, not a ton of swearing and still you can laugh.
B00FEMJF6O|3.0|It's a fun game to play . But how do I except my neighbors request.<br />And is there a community page most of my friends don't play on FB.
B00COGXX7A|5.0|Such a great movie, it really drew me in! The settings were beautiful. There were some things different than the book but it made it more exciting.
B004KSQN7C|1.0|The album is amazing. I absolutely love it, and I love Britney. But the way I received it, it made me hate the fact that I decided to get it. I really wanted this Deluxe and I got it full of scratches and in a bad quality as if it's been used for so long. The packaging was fine, but the product was not. I'm so disappointed and sad cuz I really wanted it, but not like this.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Love this game!!! So happy to have it on my kindle fire HD!!!!! I am on level 440 waiting on update!!!! hopefully it will be soon????
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|I liked this book.  It was very different from most books I read, with characters and settings that were new to me. I get tired of the same old ideas and plot lines appearing in books and movies.  This book was fresh and original. Although there was clearly some dysfunctionality in some of the characters, somehow they were endearing.  And the dysfunctionality was well explained in the sections describing life in the orphanage.  The ending seemed suitable to me.  The lead character ended up having hope and someone to love, although it was not what he had expected.
B00GH4RKYM|2.0|I'm still deciding if I should give this 1 star. The acting was trite. The plot was thin. The characters were 1-dimensional and under-developed. The romance was forced. There's nothing you couldn't have guessed about the ending from the Title sequence.<br />A general complaint about many of these movies is that these creatures never have a clear limitation of power. They get hit with a missile and they're fine. 1 &#34;super punch&#34; and they're down for the count (though NEVER visibly injured). This movie had NO governing physics at all. Only the director decides when and how someone gets hurt.<br />There were a FEW things which strayed from the original script which showed ingenuity! Atmospheric and gravitational forces similar to planet Krypton humanized Kal El. This is a departure from a radioactive crystal which physically harms him. The environment making him human adds depths to character, helping us understand how he behaves, not when injured but when human. BUT THEY DIDN'T EVEN PLAY WITH THIS IDEA! He was humanized and then trapped for 5 minutes until he got his super powers back! UGH!<br />They even screwed up the cool stuff.<br />If you just HAVE to see this movie because of it's &#34;blockbuster&#34; status, OK fine. But if you're looking for something other than a movie which tries to make Special Effects the entire story, you might want to pass.
B00127RAJY|5.0|I use this dvd on and off since 2008 and it never fails to get me back in shape after the holidays. Very easy to follow, jillian guides you through. It's only 25 minutes but its worth every minute of it get ready for a sweat cardio and strenght intervals.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|There is absolutely nothing to dislike about this book.  The story is a very believable premise and is written with deep understanding of the human condition.  You don't have to worry about making the big time....you are there.  More please.<br /><br />.
0345803493|5.0|Bought this book (aswell as third installment) for my GF and she is in love with the whole series. Great buy!
B00B0LPYXG|1.0|It started right out with a boring victimization theme. I hit pause and never went back to watch the rest. Maybe someday when I'm extremely bored, I'll try watching it again.
0345803507|5.0|Bought this book (aswell as second installment) for my GF and she is in love with the whole series. Great buy!
B00BAXFECK|5.0|This was a tremendously good read with wonderfully drawn characters.  So much happens to poor Theo who continually tries to rise above it all.  His mother's love sustains him, even after her death.  Unconditional love is amazing.  This story shows whether we want to or not, we are defined by both parents and may be doomed to repeat destructive patterns.  Nature or nurture?  Choice or genetic predisposition?  Whatever. We all have to live with the choices we have made and face the consequences of those choices.<br />Hobie?  Well, I would love to have a friend like Hobie.  What a tremendous force in the story!  There are times he does fail Theo, but once again, sometimes we are unable to do the right thing for those we care about due to forces beyond our control.  Through Andy, Theo's wealthy school chum, Tartt shows us how appearances in wealth and status mask so much dysfunction and at times outright abuse. So many fascinating characters.  Just read this book.  You will be glad you did.
B007PTJOV0|4.0|This game is alot like the original mario brothers. I like it. I does freeze at times which is a little frustrating. but i would recommend  it and play again.
B005K17RU0|4.0|I find it to be 95% right on with local weather channel...I can definitely k is for certainty what's happening in my area.
B00FEMJF6O|3.0|It's a interesting and charming game! My only complaints about it is that you have to be connected to Facebook to get the full benefits of the game and it can get boring doing the same thing.
1250038820|5.0|It was a great choice.  I love the blog and love the book! It serves as my one and only coffee table book now!
B00CSYR432|5.0|Excellent film from Studio Ghibli. More realistic than previous offerings from this studio than we have seen here in the US. But still beautiful to look at and very emotional in its storytelling. Sensitively presented characters with basic good will from all of them. More mature themes are dealt with, so this is not meant for very young children who would be bored perhaps, since its story is much quieter than a Madagascar film.
B00881VLCE|5.0|Fun way to spend time. Can work puzzles with different amounts of pieces and get more puzzles to keep the fun going.
B00ABKGG0C|5.0|Complex, detailed and realistic world.  Superb fight scenes.  Admirable characters.  I have read it twice and enjoyed it more the second time because I was able to understand do more of what was going on.  It is that good.
B003YL4LYI|2.0|This story line of this book goes on and on and has no ending.  All the kingdoms are left in chaos with no end in sight.  Because of this I would not recommend this book or the series to anyone.  It was very disappointing and the fact of the matter is I felt like I wasted my time reading all five books.
B003G4W49C|4.0|Good book and an enjoyable story.  You just have to feel sorry for your Ender.  I have not seen the movie and I am not sure I should.  I always enjoy the books more than the movies.
B000FC1HBY|4.0|I liked it, but would not recommend it because after reading all the books I found it had no end.  Everything was left in chaos.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|What a beautifully-written story!  One of the best books I've read this year.  Ill highly recommend The Book Thief to all of my friends!
B000FBFN1U|3.0|I posting rating this book until I could read the entire series and I am glad it did.  Because I thought I like it until I read book 5.  The book never ends and I found that to be very disappointing.  I would not recommend the book for this reason.
B007L6VR6M|5.0|This is a movie you can watch with the whole family.  It's intelligent, funny and assumes that you are too.  Great actors, smart kids (not silly or cute - but real kids) and a good script.  There's nothing not to like in this movie.
B00CNQ7HAU|4.0|Very Good if you like John Grisham.  Even though the plot line was easy to figure out, it was good to the end.
B005EIS5IW|3.0|As a cat person, I was looking for something with humor and depth.  The book has some humor, but that's about all.  Was a disappointment.
B001PU8N0I|5.0|Everything about this production is stellar: the acting, the direction, the script, and of course, Charles Dickens' story.<br />I first saw this on the A&E television channel. The DVD does not disappoint.
B007QA3AH2|5.0|I have always enjoyed this quirky comedy.  Great cast!!!  Entertaining, great comedy!!!!  Good family movie with nothing to suggestive for kids.
B00000IQC8|5.0|An epic tale of post adolescent angst.  Relatable characters, quotable dialogue and some ridiculously funny situations.  A must watch for anyone in their 20s.
B00ECJ18HO|5.0|I have never really read Sherlock Holmes before and I couldn't stop reading this book. It was excellent and kept you on your toes.
B0007DFJ0G|5.0|My all time favorite movie.  Drama. Intrigue. Excitement.  Life lessons.  A perfect movie to get you through a quarter life crisis.  I highly recommend reading the book after seeing this movie (really - movie first, then book - this is a rare exception). It will change your life.
B00FWLTPU8|5.0|THE MOVIE WAS GREAT. GREAT ACTION AS WELL AS A GOOD STORY. THE ACTORS WERE EXCELLENT. THE WHOLE FAMILY WILL LOVE THIS MOVIE. I DID.
0393327345|5.0|This is an amazing book.  I highly recommend this book for fans of the film.  This is a rare instance where I recommend seeing the movie before reading the book.  This story is amazing but it is complex.  The many layers are better experienced after seeing the movie.  Chuck Palahniuk is a genius - I read everything of his that I can get my hands on.  Fight Club is a prime example of his talent.
B004W1GCNC|5.0|My husband and I have enjoyed watching the first 2 episodes of this series. We haven't had chance to see the rest yet, but already are fans. We love the period details, things my husband's father used to talk about from his youth and early working life. The characters seem to be more than characatures and we are looking forward to watching them develop as the changes in Britain shape their lives.
B00ANA27IU|4.0|I'd seen the movie years ago and can now say that I now understand the ending of the movie.  As is typical, the book was much better than the movie.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|We bought this on DVD because we love this series and want to watch these over and over. We are eagerly awaiting next year's season which begins in January.
B001AQR3JY|5.0|So great to be able to buy this on amazon when it's not offered in stores right now.  My grandson is 2 and this is his favorite movie so I bought one for him for his house.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|loving it no complains I got some tips if u have upgraded version I know how to get points.  buy bushes and sell them.  to get points also race and a very helpful hint is to save money.
B008N9AAQ4|4.0|I got this as a demo disc for my theater room.  It has some great video in it to show off but I think I would just find a movie that I like to show instead.  It is just a little boring.  Some good visuals but just boring and some of the film is a little disturbing.  Anyways, something good to show off as far as picture and sound but just not something that I think I will use that often.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|I just can't stop playing it but the energy bars are a pain to wait for but it's worth it when it's done. I can't wait to get to Alaska
B000E1ZBH2|5.0|Pride and Prejudice (Full Screen) (2005).  Love this movie and would definitely buy again if it were to get damaged.
B00BMKH5NW|5.0|5 Stars. I found Fangirl to be one of my favorite stand-alone novels of 2013. I loved it. The story practically leapt off of the pages, and at times I truly felt as if I was actually taking part in the story.<br /><br />Each of the characters were special in their own way. Cather Avery is the shy and conservative half of a set of twins. She is the author of a fan fiction story and has thousands of fans. Wren Avery is the more outgoing of the twins. She wants to make the most of her college experience by meeting new friends and being social. Reagan is Cath's new tough and unfriendly college roommate. Levi is Reagan's boyfriend, but he takes a special interest in Cath and enjoys hanging out in their dorm room. Nick sits in front of Cath in fiction writing and has become her writing partner. Cath and Wren's father is bipolar. Cath feels that he must be closely monitored for manic episodes.<br /><br />Cath finds herself in college, needing to move on, but unwilling let go of her fan fiction characters, Simon and Baz. Wren no longer supports Cath in her fanfiction writing endeavors, and they are drifting apart. Their estranged mother is now trying to contact them both after walking out of their lives when they were very young.<br /><br />Fangirl was a beautifully written coming-of-age novel that was very hard for me to put down. I couldn't wait to find out what would happen next - how Cath would navigate all of these situations and relationships. This is the second novel that I have read by Rainbow Rowell. I highly recommend her stories, especially for those that love the young adult genre!
B002PMV9FG|5.0|Love these movies.  Bought the whole set for my grandkids.  They were very happy to have the whole set.  Would buy again.
B007BFSYMS|5.0|working third shift I had a hard time sleeping living with the daily noise of a normal family but this app on my kindle fire blocks out most of it and helps me relax...I couldn't imagine not having this app now
B000F1IQNC|5.0|Nanny McPhee (Full Screen Edition).  bought this for the grandkids.  They love this move and would recommend it to others
B000N2HBSO|5.0|This book is awesome!  It takes a while to read, but is certainly worth the effort.  I recommend this book with the highest of accolades.
B008JFUUQ2|4.0|My niece and nephew introduced me to this movie.  I should warn that I like pretty much every type of movie: funny, cheesy, musicals, comedies, romantic comedies, dramas...so I may not be the best judge of movies but this is one I can watch again and again.  I had to add it to my collection!
B00BPDR3F6|2.0|I have been reading this book for so long and simply can't get through it. Don't understand where it's going. It seems like the authior did a lot of research before she wrote this book and wants to show the reader everything she has learned. What is this book about? historic novel? a lesson in botany? family dynamics? culture? seemed to touch a bit of everything and not go anywhere. Too many descriptions that didn't seem to enrich the plot. disappointment.
B000FBFN1U|5.0|Amazing....better than the first two. Book 4 kinda sucks though. Jon snow is featured a lot in this book and that is the best story line.
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|Do not buy. the advertising is very mis leading. all you can stream is Netflix and Google Player which both sites they want you to buy the movie. Not able to stream videos or movies on your hard drive.
B00BBW15R8|5.0|Shows two different economic classes of society being able to have compassion for one another and recognize the values in each other, and both people becoming better people for it.
B000NQRE9Q|4.0|After watching so many mega scifi movie with advanced animation and CG, these movies look more real to me and get me involved.
0316201545|5.0|Ive all ways loved these kinds of stories and the athor just seems to capture your imaginination i found while reading the books that i could just imagine my self in the stories
B002NPUCRQ|5.0|My wife loves the videos that are packaged with this cd. Her favorite is You ought to be with me.
B0093H8H8I|4.0|You can't compare apples to oranges, even though I'm going to. This CPU simply isn't as powerful as a former quad-core I had. But that's to be expected, this is a dual-core. Other than that, very stable. It seems like there's a lot of overclock leeway, but I haven't personally played with that aspect very long. Recommended for budget-conscious system builds.
B00BD99JMW|1.0|Ughhh. I LOVED the first book. Really liked the second one. Hate this one with a passion. Horrible ending, POV kept switching, the plot was not as well developed. I wished I had never read it. I was really looking forward to the movie but after reading this one I don't know that I will go. It's hard to enjoy a movie knowing that the future ending, if they do the trilogy, will be so horrible. If you loved the first 2 books then stop. Don't read. Make up your own ending in your head. You will be much happier.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|As I read this book I'm reminded of the things we don't know and Don't want to know ;is a lot easier to rip the benefits and think , OUR NAVY SEALS ARE SO WELL TRAINED.
B008ROZAQU|5.0|Great show, typical John Wayne in a different roll.  Also, a great supporting cast.  All taking place in Africa.<br />Wonderfully filmed.
B00GHJ6BJW|5.0|It feels like a rave on Mars! It is perfect. Best songs Aura, Swine, Donatella. Not much else to say! Recommend!
B003G4W49C|5.0|Loved the Book. My second time reading it. Couldn't put it down. Looking forward to reading the rest of the quintet.
B00B5HQL50|5.0|More of a classic Bond feel with this movie. Can't wait for the next 1 to come out. Now that Montypenny and Q are back. The new M seems to fit great as well. Lots of classic 1 liners in this movie. You will not be dissapointed.
B00CNQ7HAU|3.0|Story dragged - you knew what the outcome would be as if you wrote it-most of the residents who live here found it just OK.  Perhaps because i downloaded it to my Kindle was the reason I lost interest in it -we now have it in our library so will see how other readers like it.  Bev Cleaver
0394721772|5.0|Like volume 1, this book is great for making complex recipes, relatively simple. Julia does a great job of explaining things, and her tips are indispensable. For example, did you know to dry off meat with a paper towel before browning it? I didn't. But then I'm not much of a cook. That having been said, my wife and I have made some of these delicious recipes and actually had fun making them. It was even more fun eating them!
B006BDHAX0|5.0|Well designed. This game has excellent levels and puzzles.<br />It is also a great challenge no matter what level player you are.
B00FMJJ064|5.0|Lindsey's music is fresh and very enjoyable to listen to.  The Youtube videos she produces are pretty cool as well.
B007UXTG8M|1.0|We could barely stay awake.  Depressing.  Didn't have a point.  Characters weren't developed.  No insight on what may have led to the condition of the main characters
B00EE3FVSU|5.0|Loved this show.  So well done. I watched the whole season in 2 days!  The cast is excellent. Judt make sure to clear your calendar.
B00FPH6AXE|1.0|I found this film utterly ridiculous.  The acting was like that of a goofy Saturday morning cartoon.  The alien that only &#34;sees&#34; by smelling only added to a foolish plot.  Had I been at a theater, I probably would have left.  I totally understand why this film had a horrible box office performance.
0545626382|5.0|I can't put these books down!!!!! If you enjoyed the movie, and love to read, you MUST buy this series. The movie doesn't do the story justice. I will definitely read this series over and over.
B00BD99JMW|3.0|This book was a pretty big let down for me. I liked the first two books of the trilogy so much and this just seemed like an afterthought. I don't have as much beef with the ending as I do with the plot and the changing of point of view. Basically I think the author put this book out without thinking of the integrity of her writing. I feel she just churned it out to make the money and get things going on the movies.
B00D3ITOHG|5.0|Where can I start! I have purchased many different headphones, but non have come close to the well rounded quality of the Marshall Monitors. I am usually a fan of Sennheiser but bought these on impulse instead, and I am so glad that I did! Here's why;<br /><br />Build Quality: Excellent. The cord is durable with gold plated auxiliary connections. About 5 inches from the top an inline mic and control exist, but right below that the cord is coiled, which extends about another 10 inches. The cord produces almost zero noise when rubbing on your shirt or desk, etc. The frame itself is extremely sturdy cast iron which is covered in a leather headband that rests on your head comfortably. Adjusting the height of the headphones feels really solid with distinct clicks and visual increments. I feel that it will remain this way for the life of the headphones. For the drivers themselves, they are housed in a (plastic) stylish leather, and accompanied with magnetic pleather ear cushions. Which makes these ear cushions able to be easily removed and replaced. I do feel that these cans will last a very long time.<br /><br />Sound Quality: Excellent. For the price, these headphones perform in the $300 range. Really solid bass and warm mids and crisp treble. What is interesting with these is the F.T.P. enhanced experience. Remember how I mentioned that the ear cushions can be removed from the headphones? Underneath them a removable attachment (cardboard cloth) exists that rests on top of the driver opening. While having these in place, the sound has deeper bass and a warmer overall sound (dampens the sound). With the inserts removed, the sound is extremely crisp. I prefer them to be removed, but the option alone is awesome. I have enjoyed everything I have listened to, but they excel in heavy bass scenarios such as hip-hop/rap.<br /><br />Functionality: The headphones fold easily and come with a carrying pouch, though no case. The cord is perfect length for personal use (like with your phone) but I feel if you are in a studio, it would be a tad too short. There are auxiliary jacks on each side of the headphones for convenience and to share music on vacations, planes, etc. There is a control button on the cable, but it does not have volume control, which would be nice, but it is understandable due to the fact that ios and android like to have separate volume control. The mic provided is outstanding and great for skype and phone calls. Beware though, that if you do use these headphones with your phone, you battery will drain rather quickly as these do not take batteries, and when playing fairly loudly do require a decent amount of power.<br /><br />Have fun with this great purchase!
B00D9RQO56|5.0|My daughter loves this movie and will be so thrilled when she gets it for Christmas this year! I cant wait to give it to her. At first she was unsure about it but now its one she will watch forever! Great family movie!
B00B0LPWU6|3.0|Nice effects on the plane crash. Stars strong, but languishes as another worn story of drug/alcohol addiction. Appears the production ran out of money after the special special effects early on and just kind of created a story to add another hour to the film.
B00F1W1SS0|5.0|These guys are at the top of their game. Blasting the album through my hifi and checking the crystal-clear blu-ray release; I don't really think the sound mix is too bad (it's a little flatter on the DVD though)<br />I bought the 60-page deluxe edition<br /><br />The band are completely reinvigorated after all the crap they've been through. James LaBrie comes across as very gracious and genuinely humbled by the bands reinvention with Mangini. Say what you want about DT going on without Portnoy, but these guys seem spiritually closer and happier together.
B00B0LPYXG|5.0|Well acted.  Kept me engaged from start to finish.  Interesting movie with a story that captivates and you are not sure if you should love or hate the main character.
B00G8YG8S0|4.0|Great to see David Tennant, The Tenth Doctor & Billie Piper Again! Seems like years since I have seen Rose Tyler!<br />But where is Christopher Eccleston? In July 2012, Christopher Eccleston spoke positively of his time on Doctor Who during a talk at the National Theatre. This led to speculation he was considering making a return appearance as the Ninth Doctor for the show's 50th anniversary in 2013. The current Doctor, Matt Smith, stated that he would love Eccleston to return but Eccleston declined for some reason after discussing with executive producer Steven Moffat to return to Doctor Who. And where is Captian Jack Harkness? played by John Barrowman.<br /> We want both Christopher Eccleston and Captain Jack, Back! :(<br /><br />BBC America has revealed the title and photo from &#34;Doctor Who's&#34; upcoming 50th anniversary episode, which will be called &#34;The Day of the Doctor.&#34; The photo shows the sideviews of both Matt Smith and David Tennant, the tenth doctor, with veteran star, John Hurt walking toward us from an explosion.<br /><br />Hoping they show a clip of all the actors who played Doctor Who and his companions for the last 50 years. I started watching as a kid on PBS Channel 9 back in the day, early 70's, with The Third Doctor Jon Pertwee who played him from 1970-1974.<br /><br />&#34;Doctor Who: Day of the Doctor<br /><br />&#34;The Day of the Doctor&#34; stars outgoing Doctor Matt Smith, predecessor David Tennant, Jenna Coleman, Billie Piper and John Hurt. The special marks the first time Tennant and Piper have appeared in the series since their farewells in 2010. According to BBC America, the special will be &#34;a celebration for long-time fans and an opportunity for those new to the series to jump onboard.&#34; But Clara Oswald the Doctor's new companion or Clara Oswin Oswald, otherwise known as the Impossible Girl as she keeps Popping up and coming back after death thru-out Time played by newcomer Jenna-Louise Coleman is still my most favorite companion for Doctor Who as she's the only one who can out-talk Doctor Who. The new Clara was &#34;more grounded and so far easier for the viewer to latch on to&#34; than her two predecessors, both of which could have been harder to sustain as companions and she has the potential to be &#34;a truly great companion&#34;, and that it was &#34;refreshing to see a companion who isn't in total awe of the Doctor... and she's not afraid to take the lead when she needs to. Moffat chose her for the role because she worked the best alongside Smith and could actually talk faster than him. Also Incarnations of herself are scattered throughout the Doctor's history, appearing to every known face of the Doctor and saving his life in numerous ways--for the most part unnoticed--and even ensuring that the First Doctor (William Hartnell) picks the right TARDIS on his home planet, prior to the events of the show's first episode.<br /><br />In a statement, Smith said: &#34;The Day of the Doctor is nearly here! Hope you all enjoy. There's lots more coming your way, as the countdown to the 50th begins now.&#34;<br /><br />Steven Moffat, lead writer and executive producer of &#34;Doctor Who&#34; said: &#34;50 years has turned 'Doctor Who' from a television show into a cultural landmark. Personally I can't wait to see what it becomes after a hundred.&#34;<br /><br />&#34;The Thick of It&#34; star &#34;Peter Capaldi&#34; will replace Smith in the titular role beginning with Season 8.<br /><br />Veteran Star &#34;John Hurt&#34; has revealed that his role in the 50th anniversary episode of TV's Doctor Who was one of the `toughest' challenges of his career.<br /><br />The actor, who will play an earlier reincarnation of the Time Lord in The Day Of The Doctor said, &#34;He had `given his life' over to the part so he could get to grips with the script's `quasi-scientific nonsense'.<br /><br />The 73-year-old star of the Alien, Elephant Man and the Harry Potter movies also dismissed a lot ofmodern television as `PAP' and said he was planning to cut back on his work commitments so he could spend more time indulging his passion for Painting.<br /><br />Hurt, who will star with Matt Smith and David Tennant in the episode, said: `It was one of the toughest parts I have had to learn, as difficult as anything I have done.<br /><br />`There is a lot of quasi-scientific nonsense which doesn't stay in your head that easily and that meant entire weekends spent on solid learning.<br /><br />`I remember Matt said I'd have to give my life over to it because there is a lot of learning and very little time to shoot.' I thought he was kidding.<br /><br />Hurt's unexpected debut as the &#34;War Doctor&#34; in the dying seconds of the last series caused a sensation when it was broadcast in May. Last week the BBC released an online mini-episode, which revealed that his character had regenerated from the Eighth Doctor, played by Paul McGann.<br /><br />&#34;The Zygons&#34; and &#34;The Daleks&#34; will also be featured in the special as the Enemies. It has been confirmed that &#34;paintings&#34; will be a plot point of the episode, and that the &#34;Time War&#34; will be explained.
B004ADH1RI|5.0|An old favorite. Lots of fun. Watched it on my I-Pad while cleaning the kitchen and it made the job painless!
B003G4W49C|3.0|Not what I am used to I guess. I had it figured out a little bit before the final battle.
B00EZPCYQ4|5.0|This is such a fantastic well-rounded album by a band that is constantly challenging itself to create a new sound while still being true to their art. They don't fall into that musical abyss where every band sounds alike. While the lyrics are often dark in nature, they still provide uptempo beats that are almost anthem like and then transition into slower ominous ballad like sounds. The only people who seem to be disappointed by this band or album are those who listen with preconceived ideas about what they want to hear from the band. I respect the fact that AFI continue to make the music they want rather than what the public or trends demand.
B003H4I4JU|1.0|I want action in my Sci-FI not mostly talking about religion, etc … Sorry, it's 4:25 AM I should be more awake when I try to do these.
B001BANK32|5.0|This is Stephen King at his best. You absolutely do not want to put it down. I read it when it was first published and it is just as good the second time around.
B0025UHKNS|5.0|This works well. The accessories are easy to use. On-line program is easy to figure out.<br />Routes I run are well documented.<br />LOVE using it with the heart rate monitor!
1611137527|5.0|Fascinating read about individuals and groups in society that succeed despite the odds.  It also talks about why those with seemingly large advantages may be at a disadvantage.  Great business and practical life applications.  I loved it.
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|I like using this app. It does a great job of cleaning unwanted things from my Kindle. When I first used it I was surprised at how much junk I had on here. It is much faster now.
B00FEMJF6O|3.0|Enjoying the game but don't like having to constantly upgrading my vault. It should hold more than it does before having to upgrade.
055358894X|5.0|Let's cut to the chase.  You've been looking for the next series of awesome fantasy books with great characters, snappy dialog and great story line.  Click &#34;Add to Cart&#34;.  You're welcome.  Enjoy getting to work late because you were up past bed time.
B00GH4RKYM|2.0|A few lines of script wrapped around a whole lot of special effects (which were not so special) and noise.  Too much destruction, the movie was dark with hardly any redeeming qualities.  The characters were weakly portrayed...couldn't identify with hardly anyone, except maybe Kevin Costner.  Take away the special effects and this movie should have been made for about $50,000.  Glad I didn't buy it...
B004KKYX9K|5.0|Wow.  This is the first Jodi Picoult book I've read and I'll certainly be looking for more.  This story line is modern and intriguing.  Very believable and enthralling.  The relationships are captivating and enlightening.  Not sure why it got an x rating on kindle as there were no lusty sex scenes (unfortunately).  But well worth the read especially for the music theapy educational aspects.
0385504225|5.0|Received the book in expected, good condition and quickly. Will buy from seller again. As far as the book goes, it's the Dan Brown formula where the end of each chapter is a cliffhanger. I stay up later than Ishould because I can't put it down.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Very addictive game, challenging at times. You'll walk away for awhile then turn around an pick it back up. I enjoy this game.
B00EI4V3X2|2.0|Headset is cheap for the $150.00 price tag.  The sound quality is similar to that of the X12's also made by Turtle Beach.
1609611543|4.0|Very informative and if half of what he says is true, it is scary.  I do have some sort of issue with wheat so I wanted to be better informed.
0060005688|5.0|This is a fun book that can be read in an evening or two. I really liked it.<br /><br />I found it gave me a good perspective on life in general.
B004O3YGMC|4.0|Great for streaming on the road, makes navigating my desktop at home easily accessible.<br />Easy connection with Google sign in.
B00GINENG0|5.0|This app is wonderful. It keeps my two year old occupied when waiting in those long lines at the store!! Just love this app! Works great on the kindle!!
B00F35BV64|5.0|I really enjoyed the story and the pace of the action. Although at time some scenes looked a bit like a video game. All the main actors I found interesting and the sometime complicated relationship between Spock and Kirk made the movie more interesting. The bad guy had me guessing all the way up to the end of the movie. I'm hoping the next star trek keeps this director and writer.<br />Very good movie.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|They finally got Candy Crush on Kindle and I'm hooked! Cant wait to pick up my Kindle and play! Much better than the Candy Swipe game...
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|For $35 you can't beat this streaming player. The HDMI (1080p) is incredible on Netflix. I could never get this hi-rez on my tablet, probably because it is too slow to handle 1080 data rate. With Chromecast, no stuttering, freezing, or bad syncing of the sound.  It's also nice that you don't have to have a physical connection between the tablet or phone and the HDTV. So far I have only used it for NetFlix, and u-tube. Haven't tried Chrome browser. While it is true that the steaming apps are limited, for $35, I can't complain.<br /><br />Setup was trivially simple with no issues at all. MY HDTV does have a USB port for providing 5V power to the Chromecast so the physical setup was a snap. If you HDTV doesn't have a USB port, a line connected USB port is provided.
B0011KQSZ4|5.0|Saw this film at the cinema and laughed so hard I decided that I'd like to repeat the experience - in the comfort of my own home.  This film is hilarious and understated at the same time.  Which reminds me - time for another look-see. :-)
B005D9MUWY|5.0|I think this is the best keyboard ever made for smartphones. can't use the others because it doesn't have the features I have with Swiftkey
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|To confusing on requirements to win at the higher levels and it takes too much time to figure out. Not user friendly.
0143113100|5.0|This was an extremely interesting read. It reveals that the brain is plastic, is capable of altering and overcoming almost any obstacle.
0763628182|5.0|This was all 3 of my grandchildren's favorite book and we wore it out...I purchased three of these and had their mom put them away for them to have for their own children someday.
B000V8I2QU|5.0|I originally bought this CD when it first came out and then I lost it in my move.  I just couldn't live without it and had to own it again! I love Bruce. He is an extremely talented musician, song writer, and humanitarian.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|One of the few books I have read multiple times, and I don't have much of an attention span for reading. Very disappointing how the movie turned out.
B00DYWKPAQ|5.0|Great CD. This band can make even polka sound good. Kings of Leon get better and better with every CD they make.
B00FLDG5BE|2.0|i have all crossroads releases..each year the sound quality gets better and the video better..the new release is a video disaster..how no one has said anything is beyond my understanding..the video is beyond grainy..it is just horrible..the sound does not do justice either,as the separation of instruments and the rear is just plain muddy or mixed poorly..crossroads is one of my favorite events and the 07 introduction of tal with jeff is just such a pleasure to share with people.friends are always blown away.the dts sound track is amazing..the 2010 release has so many amazing highlights and the sound and picture are perfect.im blown away about this release.could it be possible that my disc is defective? i hope so...
B003O86FMW|5.0|Loved all of it! Packed with action, mystery, and an awesome surprise ending that left me wanting so much more! I had to read Mockingjay immediately after because it was so good!
B00DWFQ2N4|5.0|I love JT, the music is so versatile and I listen to it in the car, or at home, basically anywhere.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Amazing book! Loved every line! Only downer is the ending because it leaves you wanting so much more!!!! I had to read Mockingjay immediately after!

B008MG1E4A|4.0|Great story if not the best written book.  Lots of unique insight into how special forces operate.  Worth the time
B00BD99JMW|3.0|WARNING, SPOILERS<br />  I just want to start off by saying that this series was one of the best I've ever read and the way Veronica Roth writes is captivating.  Even though this book isn't at the level that the other two were, it's still a good book, even if it is depressing.  I loved the first two books because they brought such a great story and and amazing characters.  What I wanted out of Allegiant was a fulfilling conclusion and a really creative way to show what was outside the fence.  I've got to say, where Divergent and Insurgent blew my mind, Allegiant didn't quite make it.  I felt like we didn't really get a full look at what was outside the fence, and I was looking for something greater to catch my attention than the Bureau.  It sort of felt like the characters were walking around an office building, even when they went up in the plane or Tobias went to the Fringe (which felt forced and had no pay off).  I appreciate that the story had to evolve and we couldn't have a huge fight every other page, but it was a little slower than the first two.  That's not  necessarily bad, it's just change.  I think that I'm of the popular opinion here when I say that when Tris died, I was crushed.  I literally couldn't believe it, and I was upset.  I know that Veronica Roth was following the story and trying something different in YA, but it didn't work for me.  That's not to say that it won't work out for you, because it might.  I just envisioned so much more for Tris, a life with Tobias and maybe even a family.  Aside from Tris, there are at least two other major character deaths, so be warned.  I've also gotta say, I can't believe that Caleb didn't go on the zip line for her funeral even though it was for Tris, who saved his life.  This may seem like a negative review, but this book did have positives, and I encourage you to read it so you can see them.  Like I said though, I love this series and I would totally recommend it, this book just wasn't the strongest conclusion in my opinion.
B003G4W49C|5.0|One of the most fun and insightful books I've read, even if it has a kids focus.  Plenty of adult insight.
B005MMZR72|4.0|This was a really good series. My only fault with it was that it only had one season, and the ending left way too many unanswered questions. I wish that there was at least one more episode to tie it all together.
0385537131|5.0|A fantastic read, as I expected based upon my experience with his books. I cannot recall John Grisham previously publishing a sequel to any of his other legal thrillers. However, in his trademark masterful style Grisham creates a fascinating story that centers around common themes found in his novels. The issues surrounding greed, racism, poverty, and injustice take center stage in this riveting story set in rural Mississippi. If you enjoy Grisham's books, you will not be disappointed!
B008B68IUY|5.0|My daughter loves this Monster High Travel Scaris Convertible Vehicle.  It is bigger than what the picture shows.  Great buy.
0061854549|5.0|Dan Ariely give a great new way to look at ways people make decidions. A must read for anyone interested in the topic.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This book make me laugh, and cry at the same time. And as Hazel I couldn't stop reading \\"an imperial affliction\\" I can't seem to get enough of this book. I fell in love of both of them.
0439023521|5.0|Obviously loved this book for the same reasons as everyone else. Throughout the course of the book you connect with the characters. The series is a must read.
1451695195|5.0|Am anxious to start reading this book. I have read reviews about it and think it will be an awsome tale.
145582111X|4.0|Sivers does a good job describing it but he makes it sound as though all of his words of wisdom are applicable to any business. Also did not care for his narration.
B004EPYZSK|3.0|Cowboys and Aliens?  Well, why not?  After all, if there are space aliens, they could just as well invade Arizona in the 19th century as Manhattan in the twenty-first.  In fact, the main interest of this film comes from using the idea that alien space invaders attach Arizona in the 1870s as a rationale for combining the two most sharply defined genres in cinema: the Western and the Invasion from Space sci-fi film.  The idea more or less works, mainly because everyone involved takes it so seriously:  if anyone cracked a smile, the whole thing would dissolve into guffaws.  The result is a watchable couple of hours of slickly produced entertainment, which combines the usual set-pieces of both genres in ways that are potentially interesting but never quite seem to engage each other.  The special effects are state of the art, but the acting is a mixed bag.  Daniel Craig is one of those actors who plays pretty much the same character in every film, and he lives up to expectation here as the desperado who escaped abduction by the aliens to play a mysterious role in battling them.  Harrison Ford as his enemy and ally has a more interesting role as the typical Western powerful rancher bad guy:  he starts off as a complete villain, but gradually develops into a more sympathetic character.  As for Olivia Wilde as the mysterious spooky female lead, well, let's just say she belongs to the \\"Stand-There-And-Open-And-Close-Your-Mouth\\" school of acting.<br /><br />Recommended for fans of the lead actors or students of cinema genres.  Advisories: lots of not too graphic violence, some foul language, one mild semi-nude scene; the vividly slimy aliens may be frightening to younger children.  This review is based on the Universal Home Video 2011 standard Region 1 DVD, which has excellent image and sound quality; there's also a Blu-Ray edition available.
0439023491|5.0|Collins is a great writer and the second book does not disappoint. The entire series is well written, easy to read and contagious.
B008NCSZQ8|2.0|This movie wasn't supposed to be a comedy, but it was.  The science-fiction behind the technology was not only unrealistic, it was laughable.  At least Star Trek has things that you can sort of believe.  But this movie had more holes in it than block of Swiss cheese.  Just ridiculous.
B004X8W4A4|5.0|This is just like a very entertaining episode of Castle. A nice easy read that is fun and entertaining. I find it hard for a Castle fan not to enjoy!!
B00DUGCLY4|5.0|this game helps u think. its so much fun. my friends showed me this game I really began to like it.
0439023513|5.0|There is no way not to love this book or the series. When I finished reading, I was sad the trilogy was over and sincerely missed the characters and narration. I
B00AKL1XPU|4.0|I just started playing this game but I like it already. I love that I can release the animal back into the wild once I have a full family of them. This game it very fun and the graphics are just beautiful, although it would nice to maybe have a way to a few peanuts once in a while. But, other than that fun game.
0786891416|5.0|What's not to love?!? It's just like a great episode of Castle, which is exactly what you could hope for. It's a nice, easy read that keeps you entertained.
B00CYFGCOW|5.0|I bought this Furby Boom as a Christmas present for my nephew.  It's adorable and I know he's going to love it.  He has one of the older Furbys, but this one does so much more.  He has a tablet so he will be able to do everything with his new Furby that the instructions say you can do.  I also love the festive sweater design.  It shipped very quickly too!  I love it.
B00F2P8ZDC|5.0|What a classic! And who doesn't love this movie?! Had to grab it before it went back into the vault again.
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|Great game. I can see myself spending lots of time playing it better then normal CastleVille. I just love it. :D
B0060CTLOI|5.0|Love this movie-and so does my daughter. Love Greek mythology so I am a little biased but, it really is a good movie!
B00AIUUXHC|4.0|Okay I'm the grandma, but even though a shark eating things and people this is really kinda funny. We have a lot of laughs when I watch the kids play. No I don't play. It just gives us something to do together. Even if we are laughing over something being &#34;sick&#34; as they put it. As with any of these games I always do a reality check on what is real or not.
B00FRMCYQ4|4.0|We missed this in theater...took the chance and bought it. Glad I did. This is great movie and really cute.
B005CGI4EG|5.0|I would give it a 10 if I could !! If you grew up in the 80's then in the 90's you were watching this, great sturdy disc, movies are sharp and of course very funny, awesome DVD Set , a must to any collection..
B002BWCJOA|3.0|I got this for my daughter per her request, not sure why.  It's a little creepy but overall I think there's a decent message to kids.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|I enjoy the game. I hated it on facebook. No opportuni<br />ty to play mystery quests when on facebook. I wouldn't mind a one-time fee, but refuse to pay ongoing fees to continue playing.
0618871713|4.0|Fun Home, short for Funeral Home, is a graphic novel that reflects upon the authors real life relationship with her father. The dynamic is quite interesting, as her father is a closeted homosexual and she is an out of the closet lesbian. We soon learn that her father, an English teacher and a Funeral Home director, has molested little boys and soon commits suicide.The author reflects upon her relationship with her father using mostly images and very little words to show how her life was shaped by what her father did and did not do. She spends a lot of time wondering how her life would have been different if her father had been honest with himself and with others. One of the most troubling thoughts is when she wonders if her father had been true about who he was, would she even be alive today.<br /><br />This story really makes you think about your parents and how what they do shapes you. Allison Bechdel had a very dysfunctional relationship with her father and she wonders if it is because he knew that she was really just like him - both being homosexuals - and that scared him.  It must be hard to wonder what you life would be like if your parents were totally different. One final thing i will point out is that as the reader, pay close attention to the different visual angles that Bechdel provides of the same scene as well as the facial expressions that she shows on the characters faces. They tell a lot more about what is going on that the text does.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Very engrossing game. You can really get lost in it.  Would help if there were more instructions for us newbies tho.
B009KS4XRO|4.0|I have had fun playing this game and I thought it was free but now I guess I have reached a level where I have to purchase cards to play?  I don't understand that.
B00E0H8KAQ|5.0|Volume 2 in the Decca Sound series covers the analogue years, arguably the finest in Decca Classical's storied history. A complete list of its contents follows some initial observations.<br /><br />The collection is superb, although long time collectors like myself may have some of these recordings. Two features that distinguish this collection are the original cover art (always a nostalgic adventure), and an informative, albeit rather small (hence hard to read) booklet detailing each disc. The booklet includes fascinating historical information about Decca's then state of the art recording equipment, their innovative recording methods and their extremely talented production team. Decca's roster of artists in the 50s, 60s and 70s was second-to-none and hearing them at their peak of expertise simultaneous with Decca's qualitative peak as a label, insures that this limited edition box set is an important release. Although this is an original covers collection, each disc is generously filled with additional recorded material whenever necessary, in order to flesh out what was the shorter in length vinyl LP format, so you will not be short changed. Several discs are over 80 minutes in length, with one disc containing nearly 85 minutes of music. That is well beyond the theoretical 80 minute length limit for Redbook CDs.<br /><br />Highlights of the collection include Karajan's masterful Verdi Otello, which has never sounded deeper, richer or more engrossing, the Serafin-Tebaldi-Bergonzi Puccini La Boheme which may be technically the finest ever recorded, a stunning Bruckner Symphony No.6 featuring the Chicago Symphony Orchestra under Solti, boasting sound that is nearly 3-dimensional in its overwhelming presence and power, the Shostakovich Symphony No.4 with Haitink leading the London Philharmonic in a taut and brooding interpretation, an expansive and urgently communicated Prokofiev Symphony No.5 with the superb Cleveland Orchestra under Lorin Maazel, and what are probably the finest recorded versions of the Walton and Stravinsky violin concertos. These two 20th century masterworks are played with an intensity bordering on incandescence by Kyung Wha Chung. She is accompanied by Andre Previn conducting the London Symphony Orchestra and the recording features sound whose depth and immediacy are exemplars of the engineers' skill and artistry. There are many comparably brilliant recordings. The collection offers a choice of repertoire that judiciously avoids tried-and-true warhorses. All of the Decca analogue selections are of interest, with some especially welcome due to their rarity. The sound of each recording is unusually (for any era) full, deep and elegant, with that superlatively focused, well-defined and vigorous soundstage that was eventually trumpeted as \\"The Decca Sound\\". If you are too young to recall Decca's central position as a Classical label, this collection will go a long way in explaining the details. The Decca Sound: The Analogue Years is a life enhancing collection for lovers of Classical music. Limited edition sets of such excellence tend to be snapped-up quickly. Given the many glories it contains, The Decca Sound volume 2 is more than worth the purchase price.<br /><br />The set (arranged by composer) includes:<br /><br />Bart&oacute;k:<br />Suite No. 1, Op. 3, BB. 39, Sz. 31<br />Antal Dorati<br />Suite No. 2, Op. 4, BB. 40, Sz. 34<br />Antal Dorati<br />Two Pictures, (Op.10) Sz. 46<br />Antal Dorati<br />Beethoven:<br />Symphony No. 9 in D minor, Op. 125 'Choral'<br />Berwald:<br />Grand Septet in B flat major<br />Bloch, E:<br />Schelomo<br />Voice in the Wilderness<br />Borodin:<br />Piano Quintet in C minor<br />Brahms:<br />Piano Concerto No. 1 in D minor, Op. 15<br />Clifford Curzon (piano)<br />London Symphony Orchestra, George Szell<br />Britten:<br />Symphony for Cello and Orchestra, Op. 68<br />Bruch:<br />Violin Concerto No. 1 in G minor, Op. 26<br />Bruckner:<br />Symphony No. 6 in A major<br />Chicago Symphony Orchestra, Georg Solti<br />Chopin:<br />&Eacute;tudes (12), Op. 10<br />&Eacute;tudes (12), Op. 25<br />Copland:<br />Appalachian Spring<br />Lincoln Portrait<br />Debussy:<br />Pr&eacute;ludes -

B009JZSC9S|5.0|One of the best shows on TV!  For some reason I did not watch all of Season 4 and needed to catch up for the current season and I am so glad I did - lots of drama that I would have hated to miss.  I love the writing, the cast and all of the guest stars that come and go.
B00BAXFCPO|5.0|The Grain Brain book by Dr. Perlmutter is an eye opener on today's diets.<br /><br />Well written book about grains and health.  Clearly written for the layman and great hypothesis on reasons why we should limit carbohydrates in our diet.  I enjoyed this reading.
B0007939NO|5.0|Love this movie! The songs are timeless, the dancing of Cyd Charisse & Gene Kelly is amazing.<br />It came pretty quickly, looks just like the photo.
B000002UVX|3.0|Not the best Hendrix, of course the historical value is there, especially that it is on 1969 New Year's eve, Jimi's last before his untimely demise in the summer of 1970!<br />One magical moment though: his unearthly guitar wailing in Machine Gun, goes straight to the soul!
B00A9V2JSG|4.0|The Jist: Amor deliria nervosa is what Lena knows as love. A disease to be feared, the cure for this disease if given to every citizen on their 18th birthday. A day Lena had been looking forward to, the day she will be safe.<br /><br />The summer before she is cured Lena meets Alex and everything she has ever known changes. She starts to see her world, her life, and her government in a completely different light.  Has he infected her with the disease or is there more to love than what she has been taught?<br /><br />My Take: I will admit that I took me a while to get through this book but I honestly don’t know why. I think I was just having a little book ADD (story of my life!). I really enjoyed this story. It’s told form Lena’s point of view and focuses on her thoughts of feelings about everything that happens throughout the book. I will say that the story is a little predicable but not in a way that takes away from the enjoyment of the book. This book is very well written, the langue the author uses really helps you fell what Lena in is feeling, it is almost like you are going through it all yourself. I also the love that the author used a place you can relate to from the beginning of the story, I have never been to Portland but I have a very vivid picture of it in my mind now (and I will probably be slightly disappointed in how it really looks). I love how much of Lena’s world you are brought into as you read.<br /><br />Wrap Up:  To be totally honest the ending is what is going to keep me reading this series, it was slightly MIND BLOWING! It has one of those endings where it doesn't really give you a choice but to read the next book because you have to know what the heck happens after all of that! Had it ended in “they lived happier ever after” I feel like I would have been OK with that too. It’s because of that I am giving this book 4/5.
B00CNQ7HAU|3.0|It was good and as his books  usually do, it kept me interested. I enjoyed the ending. I have recommeded to others
B00B5HQLMI|4.0|I love the Bond movies, particularly the ones with Daniel Craig, but it is still so hard to give any Bond movie a 5.
B001180MB2|5.0|I've lost count of how many times I've bought this book, and I will probably continue buying it because it's so great I'd like other people to read it.  Frank Herbert was so ahead of his time, and he wrote with such wonderful detail and feeling that this book---and the others in the series---feel like a part of my own history because they helped teach me more about myself and others.  I wish I could have met him.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I have been wanting candy crush for kindle since I got my kindle. Now the kids can play too.<br />Thank you!!!!
B00BW6SOIQ|5.0|I've had this movie sitting around for months, but the mixed reviews I'd read kept me from getting around to watching it. Last night, my boyfriend was going through my movies and asked me what it was about. All I could remember from the description were &#34;BDSM&#34; and &#34;Maggie Gyllenhaal&#34;, but that was enough for us to give it a  shot. We started watching, very aware that it might turn out to be weird rather than honest. We were both pleasantly surprised.<br />James Spader is fantastic, giving a performance with as much reactionary face contorting as Tim Roth in Four Rooms but without the camp. You can tell that this was based on a short story because it feels like the world in which it takes place is in a pocket universe, where even interactions with the real world focus almost entirely around the two main characters.<br />Maggie Gyllenhaal's performance is equally amazing, completely transforming her into Lee. My one problem with her performance is that all throughout the movie I wanted to tell her to stand up straight, but that's just because her shy slouch looks painful.<br />Almost every scene is powerfully raw and honest, thanks in large part to Spader's full immersion into his character. When he's talking with Gyllenhaal, you can't look away- but it's when no one can see him but the camera that his performance really shines. It's obvious that his character knows exactly HOW to be dominant in exactly the way she needs him to be, but when he's alone he has so much trouble with WHY and this is written clearly on his face.<br />The BDSM is light, and hinted (especially in a hilarious montage in the middle of the movie) more than shown, but it doesn't seem that the director was shying away from it- more like they're just showing you what is necessary to tell the story.<br />That brings me to the director. He managed to squeeze more talent, more emotion out of every scene than I thought possible. It's been ten years since this came out and I have never heard his name before, but I think I should have by now. He's clearly fantastic.<br />My only problem with the movie is that in the first scene in the office, one of the three steadycam operators sort of failed at keeping the camera steady.<br />All in all, this has got to be one of my favourite movies of all time.
B00BAXFECK|5.0|Layered, surprising and very thought-provoking. Observations that will resonate with me for a long time. Unique, melancholy and intellectually satisfying.
B0011TNVLY|5.0|anyone that has watched this movie knows it has action packed fast moving and magical  ... we have gone through our  3 dvd already.  My Grandson now 5 yrs old is still mesmerized by this movie.
B000P0J09W|4.0|This is the best money i ever invested in a very good classic i have ever watched and really enjoyed its well worth it in my book  its a great family movie
B0058VW36U|5.0|My 5 yr old loves it...  it has different levels so they can start at a younger age so they don't get frustrated  he loves  the animated frog and the noises he makes if he gets the candy in his mouth.. its not that easy.  Watching him I can see it takes a little skill to cut the rope just right so the candy lands the frogs mouth.. like I said they have different levels
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|Try this and see what you think but to me it's a really fun game and it will get better when you get more in the game
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|A best of 2012 book this reminded me of One Last Thing Before I Go. Good authors place their characters in tough or extreme situations and see how they react. In this case, the situation is teenage cancer. Green's characters are well developed and will leave you wishing you could spend more time with them. These teenagers can teach us all much about perseverance, love, and true friendship. I enjoyed this one immensely.
B00FRQ32N4|5.0|This game is awesome get this game because you get to own 20 robots fight them and you get to upgrade this my top lost game for AWESOMENESS
B000XUBFE2|5.0|Interesting writing style. Excellent story line, the author makes you feel, see and smell the experiences of life that Leisel endured. The characters are well developed and come alive. I highly recommend reading this book.
B003P2WO5E|5.0|Fantastic book. The characters were varied & interesting, the personalities were distinct and the world they lived in beautifully described & quite original.<br />Looking forward to the sequel.
B000GRPWMI|5.0|Great book and it makes a great gift. I read this book years ago and have gifted it to several people.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|I love to listen to nature sounds as I try to fall asleep. This has be perfect. I even heard back when I suggested adding whippoorwills to the mix. I don't normally upgrade but glad I did with this app.
B0049P1ZZQ|5.0|Creepy and suspenseful, this is a edge of the chair Series.  It is not about  walkers (zombies) it is about survival in a world where you must fight to live.
B008V2THJE|5.0|Moving, believable, bittersweet story set in beautiful Paris with first rate acting. I really enjoyed getting caught up in this soulful film that affirms life with all the pain and struggling.
B005LAJ23A|5.0|This series has unexpected twists and turns, while trying to survive.  A group trying to find food, water, shelter and some sense of security in a world that has become hostile to all living things.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|Fantastic but not possible to setup without a wireless device. Cant install from a desktop without wifi, had to use my phone
B009NH6JRE|5.0|Creepy and scary, this is an edge of your seat series.  Excellent characters, and dangers at every turn.  This is a series about surviving in a world where there is no electricity, grocery stores, running water etc.  The survivors must scavenge for everything they need.  This is a gripping series.
B0030V0PEW|4.0|Statistics that will make you squirm, counter measures that will make you sigh. What every pilot learns on<br />His first lesson. Keep it simple, in a technological world.
B001F4UHGC|5.0|This is one of  greatest movies of the car chase in sf with Steve McQueen .They should remake Bullitt movies.
B00333NCTM|5.0|great book and its the real ozzy what his life was really like in the music world and dealing with personal problems
B00FVFT7YO|5.0|Get serious about your success and change the way you think. This is not only a guide for how to succeed in the business world, but in your personal life as well. Great advice!
B00GH4R95C|4.0|Enjoyable, but superman is not very likable.  He reads Plato, but doesn't come across as being very wise.  Good overall movie.
B00F2ZL8H2|5.0|This is a cute collection of African Folk tales retold. Sweet and witty, these adorable stories are ones you will want to share with your own children.
B00EVW04PE|2.0|Very week rip off of Olympus Has Fallen.  So many silly situations that you cannot suspend reality if you try.
B00FRMCYQ4|5.0|Entertaining for adults as well as children.  My 6 year old was rolling over with laughter!  The entire family will enjoy it.
B00ENXBUR2|3.0|It's not bad, but the stand it comes with is a piece of garbage and falls apart all the time. The two pieces of the stand don't fit together well. I would probably pass on this and pick up another version.
B001NLKXK2|5.0|I got hooked on L. Genova from this book.  I've read all her books now and she's a winner.  I think you will love this one too
B00AF7XCKI|5.0|Incredible series. I watched the first episode and was completely hooked for five seasons. I would recommend it to anyone.
B008K9SG9K|5.0|This is an enthralling album.  I bought it for Radioactive but found that other tracks are just as good if not better.  My kids have most of the lyrics memorized and sing along to it in the car.
B00C5R7B0I|3.0|Not as good as here b precious books I have read all I'm order.  I look forward with great pleasure for her new bike.  But this one was not in great detail as previous.  I got lost in reading.
B0060FXBNM|5.0|Finally took the plunge and bought the BluRay set.  This is a great buy if you are looking to upgrade from DVD format.  It is also a great buy if your kids have systemmatically scratched the hell out of the previous box set.
B004UJTG6Q|5.0|Worthwhile 're reading. After sixty years I can still empathize with Tom and Huck.  Reminds me of my own childhood growing up in West Texas with my older brother and cousin Ronny.
B00632HWOG|2.0|Ever since the last update it instantly crashes as soon as it tries to open. (on my kindle fire anyway)
B00G9B1MEM|4.0|It's a good game. But it's hard to understand how to progress. I love the game is fun and stuff.
B00GH4RKYM|2.0|Just a lot of action, very little story. Unless you're just interested in a movie where lots of stuff get blown up or broken, then skip it.
B00E9E4EC8|5.0|Excellent CD by Alan Jackson ~ A great album to enhance ones collection of any type of music that one enjoys.
B0096HL33G|1.0|Very, very strange movie that didn't go anywhere.  There was no real plot.  Depressing!  I would not recommend this at all.
143911000X|5.0|Funny, witty, and a great choice for any How I Met Your Mother fans. Book came in excellent untouched condition.
030746363X|5.0|The book was in excellent shape and was very easy to read and comprehend.  The diet is going as planned and I am loving it.  My wife started the same diet last week...
B003EYVXTQ|5.0|This is an amazing portrayal of the poverty endured by many in the Ozarks and Appalachia. Better than The Grapes of Wrath.<br />Jennifer Lawrence form Kentucky easily works into the language and mannerisms of her neighbours from Missouri.<br />The use of so many locals in parts of the film make it come alive. This is the way so many of us have to live. There is no Affirmative Action for Southern poor white folks. Just an unbroken chain of grinding poverty which stretches back to Mr. Lincoln's War.
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|I love this app so far. I adore CastleVille on FB and am glad to have a version on my Kindle. It's cute and fun and easy to play. I like that it's slightly different than the FB app. Otherwise it would be redundant and boring. I just hope Zynga brings more of their FB apps to the Kindle!
B007HU4FZ2|5.0|This is the most accurate and inspiring of the Passion Plays ever done on film.<br />Those who find it alarmingly brutal miss the fact that the Crucifixion of Christ was beyond brutal.<br />Without the suffering of Jesus, the Christian religion is pointless.<br />I cannot watch this film very frequently, but I well remember the first time it was screened in Houston on Ash Wednesday.<br />The Catholics, with ashes on their foreheads, quietly watched. The Evangelicals came to their seats with big boxes of popcorn, which they dropped on the floor as they witnessed the horror of the performance. Christianity is not a saccharinesque religion.. Many people learned this for the first time as they watched The Passion of the Christ.
B002GSXKN8|5.0|What a bargain! The first two movies are Great! The last two are so so. Batman rules. The second movie is the best.
B00BY8DIT2|3.0|Hart's voice and Bonamassa's guitar are in top form. For some reason I just don't care for it as much as their first album. I think it's because the tracks on Seesaw are more &#34;rock and roll&#34; and less &#34;bluesy&#34; which is where I like both these artists to reside.
B00006AW2G|5.0|Great Stones Album. This is the nicer remastered edition. Buy this album and EXILE ON MAIN STREET also.The Rolling Stones.
B004HW7JMO|5.0|Excellent prequel to Blood and Sand featuring all of the characters (except Spartacus) from the series. Highly recommended because of the intricacies of the storyline.
B00DR0PDNE|2.0|The fact google thinks everyone is a mobile zombie is absurd. The chromecast is nothing other than a android/Cell contract pusher device.<br /><br />Google play will NOT work on a laptop for movies or TV in HD. even the standard version requires casting a tab rather than the play store player having a native chromecast button. You can cast in a tab but quality is standard and low resolution, but if you want to watch HD movie, You MUST have the app and that REQUIRES an android device.<br /><br />Read pandora was added, well guess what? Requires Pandora android app.<br /><br />HELLOOOO! people still use desktop and laptop computers google.
B000FA675C|5.0|MY FAVORITE DAN BROWN BOOK- full of excitment and fast moving plot. The characters are carismatic and easy to like .. I was totally submerged  in the story and the history the author weaves through out the book. Great read !
1250038820|5.0|Unique look at NYC. Beautifully done. I gave out 3 as gifts so far, and the Holidays aren't even here yet!  Have one on my coffee table that doesn't go a day without being picked up and enjoyed.
B00F91RYL8|5.0|Very intriguing movie. Loved the storyline. Has me intrigued about the book. It was not the typical zombie movie. Would like to see it again.
B00C74SHRK|5.0|I could not put  the Goldfinch down...it covered so many of my interests.  The characters were superbly defined as were the diverse l the locales.  A great read.
B003FNWR6Y|5.0|We love playing with this! Its still a very long game but it makes it different by playing an old game with a new twist. Very cute!
B00E9PMMX0|5.0|Classic Star Wars and comes with both Blue-ray and DVD sets! Super price and the USPS went above and beyond to deliver, on a Saturday after the PO was closed!!!
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|Even in Latin America it does the trick. All you need is a stable wi-fi connection and, of course, its password. The device has a fool-proof instalation, almost plug and play. Once connected to the network, streaming video from Netflix and YouTube is as easy as a pie. I can't vouch for other apps because they're not available outside the US. When streaming from Chrome, I did notice a big delay on the video, it wasn't like real time, but the audio streamed just fine. The box includes all you need to make it work. Maybe some people would appreciate an instruction manual but since we are in the digital era, those may already be going extinct. Overall, you get a good value for your money and a neat toy to show off to your friends and family on Thanksgiving.

B0001XAPZ6|5.0|this is my most favorite miyazaki movie. if you like this buy his manga series (only one he has written... so far...). the nausicaa manga is even better.<br /><br />i love how he portrays strong and capable women in his movies overcoming challenges. it is refreshing to know that i have so many good movies to show my daughter as she gets older that can show her what she can accomplish in life if she chooses to.<br /><br />thank you Miyazaki. this is a treasure like all the rest.

B008Q08IV4|5.0|Robert Zemeckis is one of my favorite directors ever since Back to the Future. Here again is one of his &#34;time travel&#34; movies. I love how the story interweaves the title character in and through some great historical moments throughout the movie. Laughing & crying the whole way.

B00BD99JMW|2.0|I finished this book two days ago and I'm still just stunned and immensely disappointed about the ending. I LOVED book one, book two, and even 95% of this book, but I just can't get over the ending. (SPOILER!!!) I am aware that it's a testament to the kind of person Tris was, but it doesn't make my disappointment lessen.

B00DR0PDNE|2.0|Just received the Chromecast.  Once connected I attempted to watch hulu.  The TV is a 55 inch LG, maybe a year old running at 240 Hz.  The hulu show was very jerky on the TV but very smooth on the Chromebook that I am using to drive the Chromecast.  I think there is a bit more work required on the Chromecast.
B000QCS8TW|4.0|It gets 4 stars because it was somewhat difficult to get into, but after about 1/4-1/3 of the way in the story grabbed me and I was hooked! So happy to have a BIG series to get into. Thank you!
B00B0LPWU6|2.0|If you know little or nothing about aviation or the law then maybe you'll like the movie.  The aviation storyline has little or nothing to do with how things really occur when penetrating a thunderstorm, identifying the mechanical failure resulting in the accident, or watching a real NTSB investigation unfold.  Of course Hollywood wouldn't have the same story to sell if they stuck to reality.  I really felt that I wasted an afternoon after watching this movie.
B00C6CHTX6|5.0|Curiosity caused me to get &#34;Mein Kampf&#34; to see if I could fathom Hitler's fanaticism and hatred of the Jews. The book is very well written (from a translation German to English...so hard to tell perfectly what effect introduced by the translator).<br />Hitler makes very clear what his goals were, and culminated in the terrible atrocities he committed...a fanatical genius, and a man with such a fantastic carisma that the German people were swept up in his exuberance. Diabolical...

B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This novel was something different. It was well put together and brought tears to my eyes. I love this book and I want everyone to read this beautiful masterpiece! If you are thinking of reading this, I highly encourage it. John Green is now probably my second favorite author. He knows what he's doing.
B007T8BYWE|5.0|I love this game I have only gotten the free ones by flipPix but I bet the paid versions are way better
B008JFUR10|5.0|I'll be honest, when I first heard of this movie I thought it was going to be a failure.  I mean &#34;Transformers taking on an army of Godzilla(s)&#34; is like something out of a crossover comic book.  But once I heard that Guillermo del Toro was the director of this movie, I was convinced that it was going to be good.  And wow was I wrong.  This was better than good!<br /><br />I loved every minute of this movie!  The robots are amazingly done and the monsters are wickedly cool!  The characters are done very nicely!  Heck, there is even a lot of emotion and dialogue in this movie.  Even the idea of the Pacific being a portal between worlds is actually a pretty clever and also very classic idea.<br /><br />The robots are done very great.  I love how it has two humans controlling it and that both of the humans need to have a powerful connection to each other.  I can feel that a lot of science and hard work was put into the idea of this.  Even the monsters are greatly done as well.  The smallest detail can really tell us that these monsters were drawn and then made on computers.<br /><br />The characters are also done amazingly as well.  Charlie Hunnam is one of my favorite actors, especially for his work in &#34;Sons of Anarchy&#34;.  I love how he does his actors and also manages a connection between his character and Mako.  Idris Elba played a great character as well.  I love how we can tell that he is under a lot of pressure and yet also see that he manages to have authority over others as well.  Others actors like Charlie Day, Ron Perlman, and even Max Martini were great in this movie as well.<br /><br />There is tons of emotion inside this movie.  We even get to see a lot of father-daughter, brother-brother, father-son, and also friend-friend side storylines in this movie.  Heck, even Mako has a backstory that really explains who she is and why she does what she does.<br /><br />But most of all, the action is just awesome!  The fight scenes between the robots and the monsters are the best scenes so far.  Some are actually pretty clever and pretty intense.  Even the final fight scene is awesome.<br /><br />I love this movie and I'm going to say that anyone into this kind of stuff is going to love it as well.  Buy it and watch it!
B000AGTPUK|1.0|I have loved the movie since it first came out and so does my grandson, who is 4 years old, but when I got this as a gift for my grandson, we were disappointed. The DVD was stopping in so many places we could not enjoy it. My grandson wanted to stop it and take it out. This was not good.
B000HKW7E0|4.0|A hilarious Christmas movie that really allows the entire family to sit back and enjoy every moment.  National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation is a great movie to watch with the family during Christmas.<br /><br />Take my advice and just buy this movie!
1742204147|4.0|This guide is packed with great information for anyone planning a trip to Japan. Like all of the travel guides, this guide gives you great tips to make your trip go smoothly. It has many maps, information on where to stay, where to eat, etc., but I do have to say that I was disappointed in this book because of the lack of photographs. I was hoping that this guide would contain many color photographs, like so many of the other travel guides do, but it doesn't. This is the only negative thing that I have to say about this book, besides the lack of photos, this is a wonderful guidebook.
B0039208QM|4.0|This movie is great!  I really loved it!  The villains were great and just seeing Michael Keaton as Batman makes everything awesome to watch!<br /><br />Okay, before I get ahead of myself I will admit that this movie was indeed &#34;not for children&#34;.  It was really dark and it had a lot of scenes that would scare children.  Heck, this movie makes the first movie seem like a piece of cake when it comes to being dark and scary.  But....... I actually like this movie being really dark.  I just love dark movies and it fits this movie very well.  Besides, &#34;Batman Forever&#34; is the movie that kids should be watching.  So in the end, &#34;Batman Returns&#34; is for grown-ups and &#34;Batman Forever&#34; is for kids, everyone wins.<br /><br />The storyline for the movie may not have been a great one to tell.  I was hoping for something really evil and bad to happen.  Okay, sure, having the Penguin trying to kill first born kids is evil, but what I wanted was something really clever and smart.  The storyline was okay, it just didn't meet what I was expecting.<br /><br />The characters are great!  I love Michael Keaton as Batman!  I loved having Catwoman in this movie!  Heck, I even loved Alfred as well!  If there was one character I didn't like it would the Penguin.  I'm very sorry to those who created him but I can't take him very seriously and I thought that he was a bad example for a villain.  If they were going to have a villain that involved snow and cold then they should have gone with Mr. Freeze (and no, I don't mean the one from &#34;Batman & Robin&#34;).  But despite how bad Penguin was I did love the rest of the characters.<br /><br />For a sequel to the first Batman movie I thought this one was pretty good.  It was dark and it had a good feeling to it.  The ending was a little unsatisfying but I don't mind.  The atmosphere of the movie was a little too dark but I love it.  I can see why people don't like this movie, I just love it because of the great actors and how dark it is.<br /><br />All I have to say is that if you love Batman then you just might like how this movie does.  If you think you can handle the Penguin and how dark this movie is then I say buy it.ctors and how dark it is.<br /><br />All I have to say is that if you love Batman then you just might like how this movie does.  If you think you can handle the Penguin and how dark this movie is then I say buy it.
B00CGNYDIE|4.0|A fun, colorful game to pass the time.  It's a little easy for my taste - I would prefer more puzzle-solving and less ability to just click on cells with single-colored gems to shortcut the game.

0385351399|5.0|I knew as soon as I started reading an excerpt from Dave Eggers novel, The Circle, in The New York Times Magazine, that I’d enjoy reading the whole book. Readers who love satire are those most likely to love reading this novel. Protagonist Mae Holland gets to leave her boring job when a friend draws her into a powerful internet company called The Circle. Under the company’s business plan everybody comes together with a single identity that links together all aspects of life. Eggers blends all the ambition and potential of companies like Google, Amazon, Facebook and others, to draw out the progression toward a world in which all behavior is transparent all the time. Eggers holds a mirror to the obsession with social media and a 24/7 approach to being connected. Readers who see this future state as desirable or as a nightmare may equally enjoy reading this novel.<br /><br />Rating: Five-star (I love it)
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|Sanderson is finally able to put this series to rest. It has been a long saga reading the series and I left one book off since the reviews were terrible. This one is well worth the read.

B001RIY4WE|2.0|Trying to get this to load in any of my blu ray players is like playing the lottery - why some studio decided to try to program a bunch of cutesy animations, multiple menu-driven navigation paths, etc. is beyond me. I just want to watch the movie, after all, not sit there for three or four minutes watching whether or not it will actually get past one of the many load screens, or if I am going to have to power down the player and try again. Just terrible.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This book is like a never-ending tale, it will never end, we will never know what becomes of hazel's mother, father, or Peter, or Isaac, yes I am quoting things from AIA but in truth th  only stories that truly end. Are the terribly written one's.

B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|I loved this book. Quick, easy Read. Pulls you right in. I also loved &#34;What Alice Forgot&#34; by the same author.
B007R11DKQ|5.0|I love the movie.  It has interesting characters in a star heavy cast, plenty of action, lots of magic, and a quirky love story to tie it all together.  Even the small parts, like the pirate played by Dexter Fletcher or Ferdy the Fence played by Ricky Gervais are amazingly well done (Fletcher's pirate is actually my favorite character in the movie - a bit part, and yet so awesome).<br /><br />A boy, Tristan Thorn, has fallen for a girl who has no interest in him.  To prove his feelings, he promises to get her a meteorite (or part of it) that they had seen fall.  However, the falling star was on the other side of a wall separating this world from a very different one.  When Tristan tells his father of the quest, he learns that his mother is actually from the other world, and she left him a bit of magic in the form of a candle to help him get back to her.  The movie is part coming-of-age story, part action/adventure/fantasy, and part love story as Tristan crosses into a magical world (as his father did 18 years before) to find himself in the middle of a feud between royal brothers, at the mercy of pirates, and trying to protect his find against desperate witches.
B001UV4XUG|5.0|Note: May contain spoilers. Proceed with caution.<br /><br />Film is such a beautiful medium, isn’t it? Because once you trudge through all the brainless, repetitive nonsense, there is the slight chance you might stumble across something truly rewarding. This is where (500) Days of Summer comes in. Sure, the film may be a few years old, but it’s one that has been on my radar for quite some time. Unfortunately, it found itself buried beneath everything else, and I was unable to watch it until recently. Exceeding any and all expectations I may have previously harbored, (500) Days of Summer was a joy in almost every regard. “This is a story of boy meets girl, but you should know up front, this is not a love story.”<br /><br />(500) Days follows the story of Tom Hansen (Joseph Gordon-Levitt), a young greeting card writer with a strong passion for architecture. Beyond being unsatisfied with how his life has turned out thus far, Tom is also a hopeless romantic in search of “the one.” After meeting his boss Vance’s (Clark Gregg) new assistant, Summer Finn (Zooey Deschanel), Tom falls head-over-heals with the notion that she is his soul mate. Unfortunately, Summer isn’t a believer of putting labels on relationships, which results in Tom’s life becoming hectic and confusing. As the film progresses, the audience views the rise and fall of their relationship, but the narrative is presented in a rather unusual way.<br /><br />For starters, instead of following the relationship in the usual linear fashion, the film is set-up so that the audience is constantly jumping around different sections of the timeline. Although it was a bit awkward at first, there is no denying it payed off in the end. What this formula essentially did was allow the filmmakers to show the sharp contrast between the beginning of the relationship and how it differed from, say, 200 days later. The first trip to Ikea showed two individuals with an undeniable chemistry, whereas a second tripshowed a relationship where one party was resentful of the other. Playing these segments back to back was not only creative, but also extremely satisfying as well.<br /><br />Another unique aspect of the film is that the writers tell you from the start that the relationship is going to fail. So as the audience watches Tom constantly struggle and go out of his way to try and impress this woman, they know he’s wasting his time. They know that he’s going to be left a hurt, damaged, and fragmented version of his old self. It’s an extremely dark, and risky, method of storytelling, but (500) Days nails it gracefully. Had the story been presented in a more traditional fashion, Tom’s melancholic state would have felt overwhelming and depressing. Instead, it becomes a healthy state of affairs because we quickly see how it fueled his desire to continue through life and make the changes necessary to truly be happy.<br /><br />In addition, even with all these unique aspects, (500) Days still managed to keep a consistent flow throughout the film’s 95 minutes. There is a certain confident energy that really propels the story line, and part of this is due to the acting from the two leads—Goron-Levitt and Deschanel. Apart from giving strong performances individually, there is an obvious chemistry between the two, which helps make their relationship feel more three-dimensional. Unfortunately, I did feel like Summer could have used some more attention. Although we hear her tell Tom she doesn’t want a relationship, her sudden dislike toward him as a person was never explained. As a result, she was left feeling a little underdeveloped.<br /><br />Finally, the music present in (500) Days is beautiful by every definition of the word. For starters, the score—composed by Mychael Danna and Rob Simonsen—is both understated and extremely charming. It manages to make itself known even when it’s surrounded by one the strongest soundtracks I’ve heard in years. Consisting ofmusic from The Smiths, Wolfmother, and Simon & Garfunkel, among others, the (500) Days soundtrack is fresh and unbelievably fitting. Beyond acquiring a great collection of songs, the way the filmmakers incorporated the music into the film was phenomenal. For example, the inclusion of “Hero” by Regina Spektor managed to turn an average scene into something that was both heartbreaking and gut-wrenching.<br /><br />Overall Score: 9/10 - It’s very rare that I give out a nine or higher, but (500) Days of Summer earned it. While the story itself may not be terribly unique, it’s the way it is told that makes this film standout from your every day RomCom. In addition, the film is accompanied by some great performances from its leads as well as some fantastic music, which makes this indie flick a must watch.

B000FC1HBY|4.0|A very good book but a bit difficult to keep track of everything and everyone. I found it just a bit hard at times to keep everyone in their correct places.
B00BEF1AEK|4.0|I really enjoy playing this game. It's like Angry Birds in that you are trying to aim a projectile in order to destroy enemies; however, you're positioned in the sky rather than on the ground. With just a tap you let it go of a rock in just the right position to destroy the targets. Sounds easy, but it actually can be quiet challenging! If you destroy 3 or more targets, or if the rock bounces back up and hits King Oddball, you get extra rocks to throw. There are also a number of different achievements you can earn. The game loads quickly and the graphics are well done.<br /><br />I removed 1 star because I'm having trouble with the &#34;Odd Phone&#34; on my Kindle Fire. You are supposed to be able to &#34;chat&#34; with King Oddball and unlock secrets if you ask him the right things. The first time I accessed this area of the game I chatted with him just fine, but on subsequent visits I enter in text and either I'm not getting a response to anything I type or my text isn't actually entering.
B000FBFN1U|4.0|It's a very good book but a person really has to pay attention to keep everyone and everything in their proper place.
140006922X|4.0|This book was easy to follow and a delight to read. The author's description of the great Jerusalem Temple alone is incredibly evocative and colorful--it will take any reader back to the sights, sounds, smells and feel of the first-century atmosphere of the place.<br /><br />Aslan first provides a short description of what biblical scholarship is all about and how the historical evidence and data available to all is assembled into a picture that makes sense, even though each scholarly quest and opinion can be challenged or questioned by any other differing opinion. He also sets the stage by showing us Palestine in Jesus' time was full of wandering, charismatic figures who went about healing and performing miracles and promised the speedy return of the Lord God of Israel. In other words, Jesus--in this regard anyway--is not as unique as we might have previously imagined.<br /><br />The book is invaluable for providing the cultural, political and religious context around figures such as Jesus, Paul, St. Stephen, James the Just, Roman emperors and high priests. The story unfolds in a unique way and gives us equal measures of faith, history and scholarly conjecture. Anyone who is not that familiar with &#34;historical Jesus studies&#34; will close the book with a deeper understanding of the scholarly quest to peel back the theological layers to find the real human being who walked and preached on the dusty roads of Palestine.<br /><br />Since Aslan is a former &#34;born again&#34; Christian who found himself falling away from the first-century mythology that the current Christian church teaches when he was a young adult, he is able to convey the real meaning of Jesus' words and deeds that too often gets hijacked by &#34;modern&#34; faith concerns today.<br /><br />The first century peasant rabbi has been known as Jesus of Nazareth, Son of Man, the Son of God, Christ the King and the Messiah. Reza Aslan is able to give equal attention to every name and title.<br /><br />The end of the book contains valuable notes that illuminate much of the text and discuss alternative scholar's theories.The end of the book contains valuable notes that illuminate much of the text and discuss alternative scholar's theories.

B00BT70J7M|5.0|Jonas Kaufmann is that rarest of tenor-a spinto! Verdi's music lies well in his voice and his sensitive interpretation of Verdi's masterpiece arias is exceptional! Mr. Kaufmann shows in this album why he is considered by many to be the reigning tenor of our time!

B003YL4LYI|5.0|I am in love with this entire series. George RR Martin is a genius and a master of personalities. He brings them and their worlds to life.
B008ROGZUU|5.0|This is an exceptional performance of Tosca! The staging is true to the composer's wishes-unlike some recent outings by other major opera houses! Angela Gheorghiou is Tosca! Ms. Gheorghiou has the required temperament for the role and her acting and natural beauty enhance her interpretation! Even though her voice may be a size small for the role, she sang well with good technique and beautiful tone! Jonas Kaufmann is the epitome of what Mario  should be! His spinto voice rang out in clarion, burnished tone! His acting was true and honest and very natural! Bryn Terfel has made Scarpia into a terrifying, evil man and his snarls and singing conveyed a sinister character! The costumes were exquisite in this production! Sound and quality of the Blu-Ray disc was exceptional!

We just don't yet understand the Quantum matrices that fulfill our wishes and create our reality.  One day, this will be considered elementary, as yet a NEW paradigm of reality is discovered.

B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|This show is chocker block full of wit, intelligence and just all over good fun. I especially love the character Louis Litt. His vulnerable side is heartfelt and his arrogance to compensate it is a blast. Great character! All the actors are worthy of this well written show.
B00BD99JMW|1.0|Hated this book. By the end of the book I no longer cared about any of the characters. Such a disappointment.
B00FHATBGW|4.0|Another good mystery point &amp; click w/ some HO scenes, but not overwhelmingly so. The mini-game puzzles are mostly a bit more challenging than the usual and some are even different which can sometimes be difficult to figure out what you need to do. There is a skip button, so you don't have to end the adventure if you can't figure out a puzzle! Hints are good in that they don't spell out what you need to do next except to direct the player. The story was good and spooky, the artwork was pretty nice but in HOs it was sometimes difficult to discern objects. A bit short, but the game includes 2 bonus chapters which make gameplay just a little longer than usual. Big Fish has started charging less to unlock full games, so the price is good as well. Definitely recommend this game!
0060573775|5.0|When I first started this and was hit with it's basic absurdities (not that I was surprised by them as it's known as an absurdist classic) I groaned and thought, 'oh, I'm not gonna like this.'

B00CEF014E|5.0|Masterfully written with a deep love for language and poetic turn of phrase at first I thought SOLSTICE by Damian Stevenson was literary fiction. We meet the protagonist Dana as she is being released from a week long inpatient psychiatric stay. She and her boyfriend Tyler immediately go on a trip to see Dana’s sister at the Rainbow Collective, a communal style living arrangement where her sister is now married to Clive the very handsome and charismatic leader. Tyler disappears as in missing person. All is not what it seems at the happy Rainbow Collective or is it Dana’s fragile emotional/ mental state and the many anti-depressant pills she takes daily?<br /><br />From the very beginning Damian Stevenson is ratcheting up the tension with many unanswered questions, red herrings, leads, clues and dead ends. Add copious layers of lies, deception, betrayal and head spinning twists and turns. What lies beneath will surprise you and maybe even shock you.<br /><br />Solstice is a great story told very skillfully. I give it my highest recommendation.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|Very easy to set up and easy to stream from the Chrome browser. Only downside is that it doesn't do sports very well. Streaming basketball from ESPN is very choppy.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Great acting and storyline.  At the end of every episode, you want to see the next one!  Can't wait until Season 4 :-)
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|It was amazing. It was always interesting and made me want to read more. I never read books twice, but I will most likely read this book a thousand times. I hope John Green makes a sequel to this because I am urged to find out what happens after.
B00AFCEIB0|1.0|Google Search,  it is easy for me to use the Google search, and it works real good. I think it is the best search there is.<br />  i'm sure if you try it you will also like using Google.

B00CW6DAKC|1.0|Family Farm Seaside seem to be the game I play the most. I play it every day. I love this game. I did have a hard time getting the update for it. it did not want to install.
B0036G1T78|5.0|Still holds up as a great thriller with nothing black and white, but all in moral shades of grey.  The obvious age of the tech only accents how much greyer the \\"community\\" is today, armed with GPS, cell tracking and email sifting, making the film more poignant today than it was in its day!
B00FAPF5U0|2.0|I won't lie, this app is addictive and fun, but I've been down this road before. The first few levels are just challenging enough to get you hooked, then when you've spent $50 in a month to advance through the game, you realise you've been had. I made it a point to play this game without spending a single cent on in-app purchases. The going is slow and I'm thwarted at every turn. I'll let you know when I've beat this in a few years.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Very fun game and unlimited fun with creative and survival monsters and more people are loving it the best game
B00EB6ENXO|5.0|The movie is packed with adventure.  Anyone who is a MARVEL and an Iron Man fan will love this movie.
B006AZZPCM|4.0|The only thing i dont like about this app is that it messes with my silk app if i search something it gives m  th option of using silk or tube mate and i dont like that i wish that was taken out of the app but its still a pretty good app
0743487486|4.0|I like the philosophy.  And I like the author. But I would like to have seen more parenting strategies to even out the case built against common parenting practices.
B009C7JS14|5.0|I have acc weather which is not as accurate but this one has satellite or G.P.S system so it tells you the weather wherever you go
B008JFUNHI|1.0|Two hours of my life I can never get back. Had no plot, ending was ridiculous. I find myself defending Sci-Fi all the time to people but this POS I couldn't.
B00BAXFECK|2.0|Yes, it's an unusual and Dickensian yarn, and once I got into it I did decide to finish the book because I was curious about how the story would end. But it was not at all pleasant to read, and I was glad when it was over. There was a pervasive, sour negativity to the whole thing, characters I didn't care about, and too much long-winded and heavy-handed philosophizing by the author. I was unimpressed by the writing stye. A major disappointment.
B00D1GFLWC|5.0|LOVE IT!!!  I hated to see Mac fade away...but was anxious to start the Dani books.  This is an excellent series of books for everyone!
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|I found this author's style to be a complete delight - direct, witty, compassionate, intelligent. The story was riveting and compellingly told.
006202406X|5.0|I love this series.  I can't wait until the movie!!!  Way to end the trilogy.  I hope Ms. Roth does more like this.
B00003CX8V|5.0|Shirley McLain and Jack Lemmon at their best.  This is a movie of the time period of 1960, NY City, before the collapse of civil society.<br />It is a great love story.
B001AQO3QA|4.0|The packaging is impressive, small footprint but high quality graphics.  Patience is needed to play the movies.  The message that my blue ray player might need to download new software came up each time I started to play a new disc.  Waiting a minute or so would result in the message screen disappearing and the movie beginning. I have only tried each disc once so I don't know if this will repeat every time.
B00GFOIUVQ|3.0|It's a very good game but has some serious kinks. The most annoying is the fact that the arena never cools down. Also mission 19 is impossible without a on of mana potions. Another thing that Gameloft could improve in this game is the controls. They need to be more fluid and work better. I understand this is a new game, but still they need to make sure that the only multiplayer feature on the game works before releasing it.
B008OTTRXU|5.0|I love Carly Rae Jepsen album KISS. I listen to Call Me Maybe everyday on the radio and the single is on the KISS album.
B006LSZECO|3.0|The noble is well-written with strong character development, but the predictable-unpredictability became frustrating.  This is especially evident at the books conclusion when each page turn is a change in course.  I was left not rooting for a particular outcome but rather any outcome.
B000KEG94C|5.0|One of the best movie musicals ever made. Rob Marshall deserved every award he received for this masterpiece. The editing is the most perfect I have ever seen in a movie.
1416550534|4.0|The House at Riverton, like the Secret Keeper, flawlessly shows history from multiple time periods and perspectives. Fans of Downton Abby will love it.<br />I felt there were loose ends, but that might be me hoping for a clearer ending of the heroine's heritage. Plus, The Secret Keeper was one of my favorites this year, and it would have been hard to top.
B00005ASHM|5.0|Totally Avant guard for its time. Brian Wilson had created something off the wall in a sence and people who didn't understand it then, certainly do now. A classic music keeper!!
B00BD99JMW|3.0|Somewhat entertaining, not nearly as good as the first two books. The concept is good but I felt like it dragged.
B005WTR4ZI|5.0|It says something about a book when your main criticism is that you wish it were longer.  I think the ideas outlined in this book are very important, I wish there was more content and that Brynjolfsson would have drawn out his arguments even more.
1250038820|5.0|Just fantastic book. Good printing and paper quality. It gives you a very warm feeling, much more than on a computer screen.
B008P1EWIM|3.0|it is an alright app especially because it is easy to read and looks good  the pictures in the display are actuate plays u can buy it with the coins
B007MC8YLQ|4.0|FreeCell is easy to play and the colors and designs are good to look at.  Thanks for having it available
B005D9MUWY|5.0|I'm a bit ADD when it comes to texting, so allowing me to type, swipe, and use predictive text at the same time  is awesome
B00CH3DBNQ|5.0|It baffles me that people can be so small minded that they fear knowledge.  It isn't just in countries like Pakistan but here in the U.S. as well.  How can people advance if we limit a major portion of society.  You might think we learned from segregation but obviously not.  I thank God for people, like Malala, who will stand up in the face of fear.
B005GFPZYK|2.0|Fairly up glamorous and boring account of sniper duty in war. Fiction is a lot more interesting than fact in these matters
B00BD99JMW|5.0|Allegiant picks up exactly where Divergent left off and doesn't miss a beat in story continuity or pacing. The new twists will engage and excite.
B00DHSK3RM|3.0|I haven't figured it out yet. I am sure when I do it will help me with Candy Crush, my favorite game. I am glad I got it and I know it will help me. I will work on understanding it.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Watch out.....it's addictive!!  The anticipation of getting to the next level keeps you going!  I love it! I definitely recommend it.
B0094BB4TW|3.0|I am losing interest in facebook. It is getting to commercial for me. I rarely visit it anymore, but it is good to check in ever so often
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|this was my favorite music this year.  It is well done and the music in wonderful.  The best version of Les Miz I've seen
B0036BK6MW|5.0|Excellent movie - everyone should see this ! She helps him.... He helps her in a way she didn't realize she needed help.
B00BEIYMTW|2.0|My kids really enjoy going to the movies (currently aged 2 - 6) and this year there have been several that they've seen that they have liked.  My boys are huge fans of the Cars movies, and we thought this would be a no-brainer.  Unfortunately, this movie blurs the lines between the consistent Pixar and the likes of the direct to DVD sequels that Disney makes.  What made Planes even more misleading in this area is that a few big names with Pixar are associated with it, making it seem like it was a Pixar movie in all but name.<br /><br />Unfortunately, Planes really has no reason to exist.  The premise of the movie is great, it's a sky high version of the little train that could.  The world created for it is also a great idea and there is a lot of potential based on the foundations built by the Cars series.  However, the actual script was horrible.  There was no real coherent story.  The characters are unrelatable and it feels like the script writers expected you to already be familiar with them as they are sort of stand-ins for Cars characters (with less charm.)  You might say that I'm expecting too much out of a children's movie.  When I wrote this, I'm actually looking at it from the perspective of my four year old who can go into a trance and would probably be capable of sitting still through a marathon of Cars, Cars 2, and Mater's Tall Tales with no problem.  What I'm saying is that Planes is far below the level of what some people consider to be Pixar's worst movies (I personally like Cars, but recognize that the plot is &#34;a loving tribute to&#34; Doc Hollywood.)<br /><br />The humor really wasn't great, it was full of racial stereotypes if you're against those sorts of things (I didn't think they were too bad, but some folks are more sensitive than I am), and there were only a few off-color moments such as when the main character is basically castrated, although I think they were going more for a waxing-like experience.<br /><br />So if your kids are Cars fanatics, you should probably watch it once, maybe when it comes on Disney Jr. without you paying extra for it.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game is awesome. it passes the time when your waiting a game to be downloaded. it helps me Fucus on what I'm doing. my nefew loves it. this game is the best game ever!
B006LSZECO|1.0|I found nothing worthwhile about this book. i read it for a book group amd found it to be very juvenile. i do not recommend this book to anyone who is looking for a real mystery story
B00499NHLC|5.0|Great Show!!! Full of suspense! The whole family enjoys this show! I hope they continue to create more seasons! Check it out!!!
B00499NHLC|5.0|Excellent drama with a very eccentric version of Sherlock who is also plagued by many demons. Dr. Watson does a wonderful job of toning down Sherlock.
B009IU6BIS|5.0|Too funny! Chevy Chase was the man! Makes you wonder if this type of holiday experience doesn't happen more often!
B001DAJZI4|5.0|OUTSTANDING - NO MATTER HOW MANY VERSIONS OF &#34;tOMMY&#34; THEY PRODUCE, I WILL GET EACH ONE - IT'S MY ALL TIME FAVORITE ALBUM!
B004K58GSO|5.0|One of the best John Wayne movies!!!! Very close to the story line of Rio Bravo. 2 of my favorite John Wayne movies!
0199219222|5.0|A highly recommended book, in good condition.<br />I got the book very soon, and it looked pretty new. Paper covered, not bad.
B005LAIII0|5.0|Magnificent movie that does true justice to the book. Spectacular film, passionately made and gorgeous to behold. Wonderful Blu-Ray version, fascinating and inspiring features.
B00CEF014E|5.0|Okay, now that's what you call a page turner at its best. All you need is a snack and a blanket and you're good to go for the evening!
B0092SQ5EG|5.0|Made me love her even more! !! California girl!! Shes an amazing singer....will definitely keep buying her music :) :)
B002XED5TY|3.0|My 4 year old daughter dressed as Batman for Halloween a few weeks ago and so this movie is definitely a hit with her.  It is an older version, but that makes it even better!
B0071DJZZA|4.0|Good book to start a series. I'm reminded of The Running Man with several twists. It exposes issues of power and our own blindness to how inhumane we truly can be. I am interested in seeing how it plays out, a people's revolution led by a woman torn between two men.
B00FWLDHSY|2.0|Not entertaining at all.  For all the giant robots I thought this movie would at least be okay.  But I came away not liking it.  It was rather hard to follow due to all the elements thrown in, none of them well developed.  And because of this, the parts that are supposed to tug at your heart don't.  Instead those parts were boring.  Paying for a bad movie always sucks.  I recommend you watch it when it comes on a basic cable channel or on a premium channel if you have a subscription.  And watch it then only if there is nothing else on.  So my advice is this: if you're the type who gets excited by just the presence of giant robots then this movie is for you.  If you prefer a decent storyline, look somewhere else.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Read it for Book Club and it was unanimous! Very well written.  Great discussion.  We had read his first one and were intrigued by the sequel.  Thank You Mr. Grisham!
B00CW6DAKC|4.0|I used to play Farmville on Facebook but hated everything about Zynga. So I have this a try on my Kindle and it works great. It will need an update. To update it don't follow the link in the game. Instead, go to settings and click on sync all. This will update the game and your other apps. The only problem I have is that the touch seems to be off. When I click to collect something I sometimes have to click it 3-4 times to get it to go.
B002WTOXUK|4.0|Great movie for sci-fi fans like myself. What a great set up for a sequel that could be fantastic. Besides the horribly ugly, rubber chewing aliens and the &#34;organized crime&#34; being conducted from within District 9, this movie was very well done!
B002QW7ALM|5.0|It is one of those you see more the second time you watch it.  The sets are amazing and there are some good gotcha scenes.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Great game for all ages... My 4 yr old loves it...<br /><br />Must Have Game For All Ages!<br /><br />Thanks - Amazon
B001DJLCRC|5.0|Breaking hilarious!  This is one occasion where all the hype is true.  Endearing characters you want to love and hate at the same time.  Situational comedy with a twist.
B00991TCOG|5.0|As albums go, it's a really good one.  I bought it for Crystallize, and am glad to find everything on the album is good.
B002UNMW7O|5.0|You have to get past the fact that it is not fllowing the same path as BD1.  I loved the nod to seventies bad a$$ movies and the boys are gonna have to deal with having a woman in a promentant role.  Different look and feel in a lot of ways buit if you go in with the belief that you are willing to see a different movie and not a continuation of the exact same one, you might really love this also.  Give the chick a chance, cuz she really can do the bad A$$ really well.<br />Full of inside jokes and nods to the fans this is every bit as good as the first.  The extras are also fantastic and if you have seen my reviews before, I love really good extras.  I have made some friends promos to give it 20 minutes and by the end of that 20 minutes, I could put down my guns and we could all enjoy the rest of the film.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|Setup was easy and it works so well with the Netflix app on my iPhone and iPad.  The only downside is that there are only a handful of apps that work with it.  I would love it if they can integrate it with providers of free content, especially NBC and ABC apps.
B008GJV056|5.0|Hilarious! This movie is th usual from Will Farrell...it is a family favorite to watch on movie night...Great flick !!
B000B5OD4I|5.0|This watch has been exceptionally accurate for me. Other watches I've owned with the 7S26 movement were not especially accurate, but amazingly this one has been gaining less than 1 sec/day (after three months I've only gained about 25 seconds!). The fit and finish is also great, with almost no movement in the bezel. And the lume stays bright until I wake up. I'm a big fan of Seiko watches, and this one still surpassed all my expectations.
B00ESY77LO|3.0|I love Leonardo but the movie was mostly about the other guy. Overall a little hard to follow. I liked the mix of old and new.
B000FBFN0Q|5.0|Yes, I've seen the movie, and decided on FINALLY reading the book! I have to say, though, I was slightly disappointed at how different the two were! The book (as always) was much better! Quick, cute, and a wonderfully enjoyable bathroom read!
B0032UYFA6|4.0|I am a latecomer to this show, but have to admit I thoroughly enjoyed Bod Odenkirk as the hilariously sleazy strip mall lawyer, Saul Goodman, and Giancarlo Esposito as Gus the Chicken Man from El Pollo Hermanos.<br /><br />I liked all the episodes with these two characters in it, absolute favs, and also a nod to Badger, who is awfully amusing as well.<br /><br />The only episode I found a bit hard to enjoy was the story of the fly loose in the Meth Lab.<br /><br />Looking forward to more Goodman and Gus.<br /><br />Enjoy!
1882723007|5.0|Quick delivery. Condition of book as described. Will order again from this vendor. You will truly enjoy reading this book and will leave with a new outlook on the important things in life.
B003VPWXRO|3.0|I enjoyed learning about portias life and how she overcame her issues but found the book to be a slow read.
B00571F26Y|4.0|this book is very insightful,  technical, and offers good advice I believe.  In a country where every aisle is loaded with carbs of some sort or another, reducing the gluten we eat is something we should be looking at.  My only problem with the book is that is tends to drag on and repeat itself a lot, sometimes making it a tedious read.
B006M4F67A|5.0|This is a great game.  For those unfamiliar with the game (as I was), it is like solitair but can involve much more strategic thinking.  I have been playing it much more than I should.
014017821X|5.0|This book is beautiful and creepy, a fantastic blend of poetic language, humor, and bone-chilling horror. These retellings of classic fairy tales and other supernatural stories have a surprising and welcome female-friendly twist to them. The women here are set up like typical damsels in distress, but their solutions to their predicaments are by no means weak. It was fascinating to me that I would begin to feel a sense of dread for the characters, &#34;knowing&#34; (based on having read plenty of books and fairy tales in my day) that they were in for a sad ending, but Carter surprised me again and again by turning the typical patriarchal narrative on its head, and instead equipping her heroines with power, force of will, and strength that we rarely get to see in old-fashioned fairy stories. This is the kind of book you can read again and again, and always get something different out of it. Highly recommended.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|fun  game but can be frustrating.  levels get harder and harder.  very mind stimulating and VERY addicting.  I would recommend.
B008EL25LE|4.0|I was playing this game non stop for days, till I reached a level i just can't make it past.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Great Movie.  Watched with Amazon Prime.  Well worth the cost for membership with PRIME.  So many movies to download, free shipping and tons of books to read with Kindle Fire HD provided with membership.
B00DI75SWM|3.0|Wish it had more picture choices. I like that you can create your own custom colors. Use it every Friday
B002ZG99TK|4.0|Good, not super great, but a great way to spend an afternoon with a big bowl of popcorn. The extra features were like a quickie film school.
B00ENTDDGW|5.0|Have this on my phone it keeps the kids busy on some of those car trips, plus you can play it by yourself, which is also nice.
0061780308|3.0|I bought this on the recommendation of a friend and dog person. I like dogs. I like them a lot. I used fast forward on about half of the book as it was that boring. The race car stuff is good, but the wife's illness was way too drawn out. Pass on this one.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|My daughter bugged me for months to get this game, now she can't put it down. I've only tried it a couple of times, and it was fun.
B002ZG98FU|3.0|Most chick flicks make me want to barf the last meal or two, but this one was fun, but a bit slow. Good extra featurres
B007EC27QM|5.0|great to have when your in the store,a nd need a quick calculation before check out. Or to calculate your discount.
B00A81NFAS|5.0|I am a huge fan of Jennifer Lawrence, but don't like crazy people movies or long dramas. However, I found myself being drawn into the plot. The whole football thing was boring, though.
B004DM1ZQY|4.0|Used to play on a real board when i was young, had forgotten all about it, till I got the app. I'm a little rusty, but I am improving.
B005LAIIQC|5.0|This movie just blasted along non-stop. No let up in action. The acting was top notch and the entire movie was well put together.
B00DRPVE3M|5.0|nice game to play love it. when I get bored this wat I play must download. team uno and friends
B000MQC9H4|4.0|I only bought this only because of the ultra hot Kate Winslet was in it. A slowish film, but worth the time you invest. Don't pay big bucks for it.
B0031ES8P6|5.0|Beanie Babies are really cute. My girlfriend got one of the Halloween ones for me so I thought I'd get this one for her. She loves it.
B00005V9HH|3.0|Bought this on a suggestion from a friend who is a total movie freak and who really like this film. I watched while surfing the internet.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I love this game. It's good for ages 10 and older. it also teaches you on how to care for an animal. this is a good game I hope you enjoy the game
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Very addictive.  It seems like you just want to keep playing.  It appeals to young and old. You can't stop playing!
1569765677|5.0|A great book that is intense and makes you feel like you were there when he describes things. Much better that the movie.
B000M341RI|5.0|When I first saw this picture I loved the characters, dialogs, music, mood, the relationship among these unemployed men, their struggle, and how little by little they develop a strong friendship.  Each of the actors portrays a stereotype, however, it doesn't prevent them from giving depth and credibility to any of the characters.<br />Exquisite comedy, in my point of view.
B0037VNX44|5.0|The &#34;little guy&#34; doesn't win against the system but he keeps trying, and trying and trying. Great role model for human spirit against oppressors and morons. Go get'em Charles Bronson!
B008XKSW7M|2.0|Some good moments, but not particular exceptional  story line or acting.  Jennifer Lopez and Cameron Diaz did a great job in their roles.
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|Really makes sense of the Bible and what is known about Jesus based upon history. Most church goers will learn about a Jesus character they have never heard of in their church.
B008JFUPK8|5.0|One of the best in this series.  It bounced around in comparison to the original movie, but the plot remained the same.
B00G32OMF8|2.0|Loved the series, but Ethan Hawke is just plain annoying here.  The dialogue is well written, some very good thinking points, but much of it felt forced.  I couldn't get through it and liked the other ones.  Probably 2.5 start is closer.
1476758581|1.0|I am disappointed with her newest book.<br />All it has is stories from  different people . The stories are not told one person at a time, its a little bit from each person in every chapter. I am glad for all of them, but i didnt get much from it.<br />I loved Rhondas other books, but not this one. Disappointed!!!!!
B00CSYR432|3.0|I've seen all the Miyazaki movies and was pleased to see this release during a recent check-up on what's new.  I watched it with two other fans, both of whom saw most of the other films with me, and we all had the same reaction:  Meh.  Then we were backpedaling and apologizing and excusing because well, something must be wrong with us if we weren't absolutely amazed, right?  It's Miyazaki, it has to be awesome.<br /><br />Well, I'm afraid it was merely OK, at least for us.  On the plus side, the visuals are beautiful and the portrayal of daily life in his period drama is interesting and engaging.  I wish I could say the same for the plot and characters, however.  We thought the &#34;problem&#34; wasn't toothy enough to make for interesting drama, and the principal characters were so reserved it was difficult to really care deeply about their successes or failures.  It didn't have any of the magic of Ponyo or Spirited Away (literally as well as figuratively) and the music was wonky (intentionally, to fit 60's Japan, but i still didn't like it) rather than breathtaking.  Finally, the ending left too much unsaid for our taste, with one of us saying out loud &#34;wait, it's over?  Just like that?&#34;<br /><br />Collectors and diehard fans will want to see this one, but if you're a casual fan I suggest investing in a different Miyazaki title (Ponyo, Spirited Away and Howl's Moving Castle in particular).
0399159347|1.0|Another really vapid publication. It appears as though the author did not do much research when throwing this book together. Unrealistic and badly developed.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|I love this social program because it allows me to get and keep in touch with old friends and family members across the country at anytime of the day or night.  It allows me to contact them without disturbing their schedules, etc.
1439153663|3.0|The author has no real concept of the subject.  Do authors actually do research anymore? Stringing the requisite number of words together required by a publisher to call something a book does not make it a book!
B008JGSM6G|4.0|It's a fun mind-teaser, but not my favorite game.  After a few tries, it get a little repetitive.  If you only have a few minutes to play a game, it is entertaining.
0385535139|1.0|A hack book written by a formulaic writer.  Premis simply doesn't work on any level.if you are a fan of this dreck, you will enjoy it.
B00BW5K5DO|5.0|This game is perfect for me. I'm not a gamer. I don't have mad skills. But I love Royal Envoy. Admittedly, I have been stuck at a certain level for a long time simply because I refuse jump ahead. Hey, it's not Frogger.
1439156816|5.0|Stephen King tells it like it is. It's exciting to read about his upbringing and how he came to be the writer that he is. He also gives invaluable information on what works and what doesn't in writing. Highly recommend it to anyone who is serious about writing!
B0064MPXFA|4.0|Really smart literary and historical references, good casting, great guest stars and enjoy excellent plot with wicked twists. I like this series very much and look forward to Amazon Prime free Season 5.
0307476073|5.0|Powerful and mesmerizing! Wanted me to get out there, somewhere, even if I knew I had no chance of surviving! I got to enjoy it vicariously through Strayed! Thank you for that! LOVE!
B008JFUPK8|1.0|I've seen this movie twice now, once in the theater and once - after I'd convinced myself that it couldn't have possibly been *that* bad it must've just been me, and bought it - at home. I was right, it wasn't as bad as I'd remembered. It was so much worse.<br /><br />From the moment the film opens you just know you're in for a long and far too overblown ride for the subject matter at hand, and that's saying a lot since it's about...in case the film title fooled you...you know, \\"Superman\\". Not only are we subjected to the whole origin story again, we have to see the live cave-birth of young Kal-El, and the attempted hostile takeover by the forces of Zod (wherein Zod laser blasts an old lady to death in Hollywood's sad attempt to up the ante; \\"We've all seen bad guys shoot grown men, but you know what we really haven't seen yet...?\\"), and every other sad armor-clad Krypotinian moment. Interesting fact, when there's an actual \\"natural birth\\" on Krypton, a Kandorian Two-Horned Swamp Bison lifts its gaze from its cud and bellows mournfully at the ugly yellow-grey sky.<br /><br />Ok, the movie looks nice, that earns it a star. It's quite lovely really, and dark and gritty (just like Superman has always almost never called for), and the sound design is pretty amazing as well, but the stand out performance is by Weta Digital (you thought I was going to say Michael Shannon, didnt you?) and their \\"liquid geometry\\" or in average viewer parlance, little metal balls. The scenes where this CGI effect is used for flashback are Constructivistly astounding.<br /><br />Other than that, Man of Steel is confusing, ridiculous, and just really unusual in its style and storytelling. I honestly can't figure out what it was trying to do. It would be funny if it wasn't so sad. Sad, in that it I think it was successful by Hollywood standards so Zack Snyder will probably get to do another one or two, or worse, this weirdo style of storytelling will take root in the industry and ruin all future films forever.<br /><br />Lastly, I just have one question. What makes Super-Hopeman so good? Why is he so wonderful to humans, why does he want to save us all? Personally, I can't see it. Every single person, with the exception of his too-famous-for-this-movie parents, is a total dick to him. The rural dummies bully him want him severely dealt with for saving them. People call him greenhorn, pour beer on him, and are just general douchebags (say nothing of how Zod the Bod treats him) and yet he turns out sweet and innocent and good, I don't get it. I would so be the opposite of Superman. I'd wreck this planet so hard just on general principle and make them all pay. Guess its nature and not nurture after all. Maybe for \\"Man of Steel II: The Inevitable Lex Luther Because Really Who Else Is There?\\" we'll get to see something better but I doubt it, Man of Steel crushed that hope.e films forever.<br /><br />Lastly, I just have one question.

B00G32VYDG|3.0|Decent brainless action movie. Too much wannabe MIB but not enough witty banter and subtle humor. The jokes in this movie slap you in the face over and over till you're drooling and wishing you hadn't just spent $4.99 on the HD version. Overall it's funny, a good brainless flick that is on par with Green Lantern and Wolverine.
B00DGO8CL6|5.0|The Diving Board!&#34; What a fantastic recording! Belongs in everyone's music collection! A classic! For everyone on your Christmas list!
B008XX6J4C|5.0|Great CD, used a couple of the songs in our wedding.<br />I've listened to the Piano Guys on Youtube and love their work.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Challenging, addicting. This particular game stimulates the brain to think , promotes eye-hand-brain coordination. Elderly people who like electronics like cellphones or dabbling with computers should download this to keep Alzheimer's away. Keeps the brain cells productively active.
B00C33M2EE|5.0|Great CD, used a couple of the songs in our wedding.<br />I've listened to the Piano Guys on Youtube and love their work. This CD has some great new content and does not disappoint
B00DC7NNAC|4.0|I was expecting a pretty horrible movie. I hadn't gotten a chance to see it in the theater and the only things I had heard about it were generic &#34;it was terrible&#34; &#34;I didn't like it&#34; sort of comments. It was a very imaginative, fun film. It wasn't horrible at all. It had some cheesy elements, but I found them fitting as it made it jibe more with the original. Very enjoyable. Don't believe the hype about this movie being awful. And remember, the original had a whole lot of years to become a classic, household name. A lot of times when we think of, or remember it, we are actually referencing our relationship to it more than the actual movie.
B00CL0J99K|4.0|Still a great franchise, and much more explosive than the 2nd. There's no doubt that Robert Downey Jr. holds together the entire Marvel world. Everything revolves around these franchises and I hope to see more of them soon
0525478817|5.0|A beautiful book that I will reread and enjoy. I am still pondering it a month after finishing. I didn't realize that it was a Young Adult YA book. I'm a middle-aged adult and enjoyed it immensely.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|Works well. No crashes. I like how you can use personal music as they wake up. Like the options such as decreasing snooze time.
B0097EWK3A|5.0|love the game will play the next chapter puzzle some where easy some were hard thanks for the hints<br /><br />&quot;&quot;
B00CW6DAKC|1.0|And then there seems to be no way to update it! This is so frustrating! If anyone finds out how please post so I can go back to enjoying this game again!
B007SYWFRM|5.0|Haven't been able to put my kindle down since I downloaded the game. There is always something to do and it stays interesting!
B00CH26TL8|4.0|Like this game. Fun to play. I would recommend it to anyone who wants to pass time and be entertained.
B00BD99JMW|2.0|There is no way to rate this w/out spoiling it. The series was intriguing and the final book was a let down.
B00FOU1O3S|4.0|Absolutely cute and fun to play. It could have a little more animation with the characters, but super cute as it is and addicting to play.
B0047ECYEK|5.0|This is the all time good time movie!!! It was Michael J. Fox at his comedic best because I never really liked him as the dnootie know-it-all from Family Ties. I always saw more in him than that and this was it along with other movies that followed. Plus, it was so good that I never even watched the sequel because I knew it wouldn't be as good and I like Jason Bateman. Enjoy!
B000FCKC4C|5.0|This book is deep, a classic. Everyone must read it at least once. Will provide lots of insight ! !
B00DVKOYBM|5.0|I love me some eight ball!!! Can I get any more country than that? I don't even want to try because its not necessary. Any pool lover, online that is, would probably say the same.
B00991TCOG|5.0|I almost never give anything a 5 star, to me 5 of 5 is perfect, but they list 5 star as 'love it' so I went with love it... even beyond her music which I love, I celebrate her spirit to do as she feels is right, which defies the industry who loves to completely package their ''show ponies'' to bring the money back to them (telling her not to dance, etc)<br /><br />Lindsey struck out on her own, stayed true to herself and did her own thing... and is taking the world by storm! Go Lindsey!
B00DR0PDNE|2.0|The chromcast work only in us.  In Saudi Arabia only work with youtuop.  And that really depressed.  Any way I bought 6 prices and all of it useless .
B00FAPF5U0|2.0|True it's fun and very addictive but you can only get so far before  the levels become extremely difficult to pass unless you pay 99 cents for &quot;special&quot; power ups! So this is really not a free game.
B00FWLSLJ4|4.0|Good special effects, good story, a lot of action, ok humor and bad acting.  Destin to become a sci-fi classic.
B00D8CSVLW|5.0|After the disapointment of John Grishtoam's last book I thought he had possibly lost his flare. However this is John Grisham back to his best with the usual twist and turns and unexpected turns and incidents which made it truly difficult to put down. I felt it was as good as any of his stories,
B005MMY9A8|5.0|This is a great sci-fi movie.  Actually acting is good, something not found in many sci-fi movies.  Good story line and great special effects.
B00GGETKE6|4.0|Laugh-out-loud funny! Good combination of characters in the movie. The actors and actresses play well off each other. My kind of twisted humor and thoroughly enjoyed the film!
B00B5HQLMI|5.0|Best James Bond picture yet.  Great story line, good acting, humor I can laugh at, and great special effects.  Will watch again and again.
B00FEMJF6O|3.0|While I do enjoy playing this they make it difficult to do anything since it's so hard to make $. They should have rethought the $'s of things that you have to own to progress further in the game.
B007MOU6ZQ|5.0|Surprising the twists this book took. Some of it went over my head because the authors internal processing got in the way but occasionally a big idea would jump out &#34;negative capability&#34; I will never forget
B000QRIGJY|4.0|Mr. Connelly does fantastic in all of his books.  The plots are interesting and exciting.<br /><br />15 more words required15 more words required
B0064X7FVE|5.0|Great app, easy to use, great graphics this app also is loaded with useful info.<br /><br />  I check it every morning.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I agree with the rest, not too challenging but enough to keep you interested. Wang more levels though!<br />I highly recommend this game.
B00AVF8USS|4.0|My Wife and I originally saw this when it first came out in the theater - in 3D - and loved it. We used to go every Sunday after church and I'd pick a new movie one week and she'd pick the next. I can still remember watching as the burning tree fell, trying to brush the embers off my shoulder, turning to my wife and we both just laughed!
B00BD99JMW|5.0|The whole series was hard to put down. This final chapter had the action, intelligence and suspense of the others. I was not a huge fan of the ending but I didn't completely hate it either.
B008TMA1LY|5.0|Hello Kitty Cafe is a cute n playful addicting game for kiddos &amp; big kids at heart. Our 7 year old daughter really enjoys spending time on the Kindle Fire serving her customers and earning cash. I like the colorful graphics, and this app never crashes.
0441018866|5.0|One of the last sci-fi books I have truly enjoyed.  There is nothing for me to say that hasn't already been said by a previous reviewer.  I really liked the feeling of starting off on an epic journey; after reading the first 30 pages or so I could tell I was in for a ride.  I liked this book a lot and I don't want to give a single thing away, I recommend it!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Tried for a very long time to stay away from this game and finally gave in. It is a lot of fun to pass the time. Highly recommended.
B000NTPDSW|4.0|GODFATHER!!!<br />Does it need any further explanation?<br />Blu-Ray is even better in almost all categories... sound, video and re-mastering is done superbly
0062255657|1.0|Weird---this seems to be the trend today.  I am tired of it.<br />I read reviews about good books and am disappointed<br />when it is another of these weird plots. The Ocean at the End<br /> of the Lane is one more disappointment.  The&#34; Rathbones&#34;<br />&#34;Unwritten&#34; and &#34;The Darkest Room&#34; have pushed me into reading<br /> nonfiction, biography and the older books--written 40s-80s. Some<br /> of the older writers I have  read with pleasure are O'Hara, Wambaugh,<br />Reynolds Price, Updike, and Jim Lehrer.  I guess I need to tell you<br />what this book is about so you can decide for yourself.  I&#34;m not really<br />sure what it is about. A lonely, fearful and shy 7 year old  boy finds his<br /> &#34;safe place&#34; and also finds a protective friend.  He returns 40 years later<br />and things are unchanged.  He experiences and relives his memories.<br />  I think that's right.
B000QXDFQW|5.0|A great movie especially given the times of today with domestic terrorism and such. I'm a big Jeff Bridges fan and Tim Robbins is great as well. Highly recommend.
B00005JNBQ|5.0|It makes me laugh every time I watch it...  Lighthearted, no sex, no violence and doesn't need it.  Yes it is silly and stupid but that's on purpose.............Gosh!!!!
B00CDTSFF8|5.0|Being a history buff, I loved it! Can't wait for the 2nd season! Of course looking at Travis Fimmel didn't hurt any :)
B0067AC5KA|5.0|Good story, suspenseful, interesting characters will read again in a few years.  Became very involves with the main character and her life.
B00BPDR3F6|5.0|I've just finished reading this book and I don't know  if I'm crying because I hated to know the leading lovely lady would soon be passing or because I just didn't want this fascinating book to be over with. If I could portray gushing from my written word I would but I'm not a writer so just let me say please put this book on top of your reading list and you will not regret it. I feel like she has transported me around the world and back. Many thanks to Ms. Gilbert for writing this book.  I feel privileged to have been able to have felt so much through all the pages.
B00FPGSPQU|3.0|Just not as engaing or funny. More nasty & violent than a good &#34;caper&#34;. Seemed like they phoned it in.
B009ZQJ0ME|3.0|After watching this movie, I was surprised to read all the 5-star ratings it received. This movie just didn't click with me. Although it tried to tackle a difficult subject, I felt the plot was weak. &#34;Fahrenheit 451&#34; and Ayn Rand's &#34;Anthem&#34; (both books, I know) dealt with this in a much clearer fashion.<br /><br />Our protagonist, a stone-cold killer, misses one dose of his medication and suddenly slides down a path against his establishment, reading and listening to classical music. It was too far of a reach for me. I think Christian Bale played a believable bad-guy in the beginning, but I was lost after his transformation.<br /><br />I added an extra star for some interesting action sequences which will appeal to some watchers. Overall, I would not recommend this to a friend to watch.
B009NQZVKG|5.0|All James Rollins books are five stars.  Have read all of his books and always look forward to the next one whether it involves Sigma or not.
B000YMM3CC|5.0|Wow, what a great movie, just beautiful. One of the most touching movies I have ever seen. A love story extraordinaire!
B00BAXFJ5M|5.0|I always enjoy David Baldacci books. He is one of my favorite authors. Love the TV series &#34;King & Maxwell,&#34;
B00E6F155E|5.0|What else can I say, PG of yore and this newly remastered concert is sublime. The DTS-HD soundtrack roars to life, each song is wonderfully rendered by PG, Levin, Katche and co.<br />One bonus is the fact that they included a remastered PLAY DVD with the correct DTS normalization. If you are fan of PG, add this to your collection.
B0018QQQK8|5.0|I love the book and the movie. This is a sweet love story, but can't figure out if it has a happy ending. In the movie it does have the happy ending, but the book, hum, I'm not to sure. People say that is Nicholas Sparks' writing.  See for yourselves.
B008JFUPK8|5.0|A new Superman, and wow he is handsome. This is the very beginning of Superman. You don't even see Clark Kent the newspaper cub reporter unto the end of the movie. Oh, but it has all the Superman stunts and action of him saving Earth through out the movie.
B004GXZ69W|5.0|This is the second one that I've bought for my wife to use at work. The first one I bought about 2 years ago, and is my favorite mouse to use, due to it being very comfortable, and easy on my hands. I am a computer programmer, so I spend a lot of time typing. I think alot of pain in the wrist came from the repetitive clicking of the mouse, not just the keyboard. This mouse makes the mouse clicks stress-free on my hands, so I don't mess up my wrist. Eventually after using this everyday, my wrist is fully healed from carpal tunnel pain. I don't have pain anymore, but I still keep using this mouse consistently, because I know any other mouse will do damage to my wrist, even those other so called ergo mouses that they sell in the stores. I've tried them all. I think a lot of people don't appreciate being pain free, and think carpal tunnel will never happen to them, until they get it. Then they want to get rid of it, because it hurts. I am glad I found this product, because it enabled me to continue working. I think everyone who works on the computer often should buy this, even if they don't have wrist pain yet. I think it's pricey compared to other mouses, but still a relatively cheap solution considering that any doctors visit, and lost productivity will cost me many times more. I gotten more than my money's worth out of this. Thank you.<br /><br />One tip I got to leave is that this comes in multiple sizes. Get the right size, and you will love this. I am about 5 ft 10 inches, male, and I use the small. I remember there being something you can print out on the manufacturers website, and measure against your hands with the paper, to come up with the size. That was about 2 years ago that I did that.
B003L20IHO|5.0|Wonderful movie. Zac Efron has done it again. Beautiful acting, a tender story of brothers, never ending love, and a Hero . The scenery is  beautiful.  Enjoy!<br /><br />. Beautiful scenery

B000NVIXDW|4.0|Michael Buble is an excellent singer. I enjoy his music, plus he can sing most anything. So glad he is going this for the current generations.
B006LG7O38|4.0|Great remake! Colin Farrell was perfect choice for this role, or should I say this role was written for him?!
B00CWV8TIU|3.0|It was okay, not the best I have seen any of these actor play in. Different I guess is the best to say.
