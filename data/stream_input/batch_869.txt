B001O4XWJM|4.0|The only regret I have with this movie is renting instead of buying it. For recent westerns this one was loaded with better known actors who played the characters fittingly. Great directing and cinematography. A good storyline too. It's a 'got-to-see' movie.
1439130833|4.0|This is all the things your grandmother told you.  Think good thoughts, be positive, keep your eyes on the prize, etc told in a more metaphysical way, reminding you, \\"do the right thing, be thankful and positive and good things will come your way\\".  I didn't love the talk show hype around it, but the message is true and good.
B000000WGL|5.0|If you're a Stones fan, I mean a lifer like me, then the first time you heard this record you would've realized (like me) that Keith is the heart and soul of the band.  Mick without Keith is everything you hate about Mick, whereas Keith without Mick is still everything you love about Keith.  The fact that this is one of the most forgotten albums of alltime is a real shame.  Me, I break it out at least once a year just to reconnect with that passion for rock 'n roll I've had since LBJ was prez.

1400082773|3.0|\\"Dreams from my Father\\" is fairly well written.  Mr. Obama is a good writer.  But. . . I am not sure about what sort of person the writer really is.  I suspect that he may be somewhat of an odd duck.  Not a black swan, but an odd duck.  I do not understand why Obama chooses to relate to his father, whom he saw so little, rather than his mother or his white grandparents.  There is more going on in his head than he admits to being there.    I had to mark my rating of the book down because it left me with more questions about the man than I had when I started it.  This man deeply disturbs and worries me.  Among my worries is my perception that his actions do not show the man of hope that his considered words seem to claim that he is.  I worry that Mr. Obama may prove to be, just, another power-seeker and that this book is mere propaganda.  I really hope I am wrong, and that Mr Obama proves to be a good president.  But, perhaps some of the old sayings about hubris will apply, with poor consequences for all of us.
B000E41MS6|5.0|The new series starts off so well. Christopher Eccelston makes a brilliant Doctor. He reminds me a lot of Jon Pertwee's, Tom Baker's, and Paul McGann's Doctors while making his Doctor a completely new charater himself. The episodes are brilliant. \\"Rose\\" makes a great premiere episode - bringing in both old and new fans to the show. The only let down to that episode is that it is a copy-cat of \\"Spearhead from Space\\", but still it's hard not to like it. After all, who can say that \\"Spearhead\\" wasn't that good? It was brilliant! The worst episode was \\"Boom Town\\", and it's even hard not to like that one. The best episodes were \\"Rose\\", \\"Aliens of London\\", \\"World War Three\\", \\"Dalek\\", \\"The Empty Child\\", and \\"The Doctor Dances\\". In all, there is not one bad episode, and I highly recommend this season!

B001KYJA6K|5.0|Christina Pluhar and her orchestra L'Arpeggiata, made a great record again.  Experience how great the music of Monteverdi is when played on a different and creative way, with respect of old instruments and old playing practises. Christina and her collegues really love this music, that you can experience when listening to this record. Nuria Rial is one of the best sopranos of today, her voice has this remarkable Spanish colour in it, making her the ideal performer for misic like Monteverdi. Leaving the rusted traditional ways of making music and exploring new views of music practise now has its fruits: This record is a joy to listen to, very well recorded by Virgin: when you have a high-end audio set now you can enjoy every dollar you invested in it! Listen to more records of L'Arpeggiata like \\"Los Impossibles\\" you will be amazed!    5 stars! Recommended.    regards,  Hans.

B001PU8N0I|5.0|I only recently read Little Dorrit, and it is my new favorite Dickens novel. The story of Amy Dorrit, an honest girl born in debtor's prison, is a wonderful tale full of ups and downs, trials and tribulations, death and romance. As with many Dickens books, it literally has a cast of thousands, and this production follows most of the storylines from the book quite faithfully. I just watched this on the internet, and I thought this version was sensitive to the material and did a good job of keeping the characters engaging and true while obviously having to shorten Dickens' voluminous descriptions into shorter episodes. The story is a bit of a soap opera with plenty of bad luck and broken hearts lying around. However, it totally works for me. When I read the book, I actually couldn't put it down and devoured it in a couple of days. This movie was the same way. I couldn't stop watching it or wait until the next episode. At the end, I was sitting in front of my computer crying. It is just a lovely story, well-scripted, beautifully acted, and engaging throughout. I haven't ordered my copy yet so I can't speak to any issues with the actual dvd yet, and I will admit that I have thus far been unable to sit through the 1988 version. I want to like it since I've heard so many raves about it (and I adore Derek Jacobi--he's my all time favorite Hamlet) but it moves very slowly and ploddingly to me, and I just lose interest. So I highly recommend this version if you like Dickens at all or if you like any of the actors because the cast (Matthew Macfadyen and Claire Foy especially) do a lovely job. UPDATE: I received my dvd from Amazon and am thrilled to have purchased it. I had seen it on the internet and on Masterpiece (I'm in the US) and the episodes on the dvd are a bit different from what was shown on PBS. The dvd set consists of 4 discs in a widescreen format with 14 episodes coming in at a whopping 452 minutes and includes an interesting \\"making of\\" feature with info. about Dickens himself as well as the film's production. I'm pretty sure I saw a scene or two here that was missing on PBS, plus I got the widescreen format that I didn't get on my tv. A word of caution: the episodes end in cliff-hangers that make it almost impossible to go to bed without watching \\"just one more episode.\\" My husband and I both love it and have already recommended it to several people we know. This is a great movie that will make a superb addition to your home dvd library.Dickens himself as well as the film's production.

B001PPLIEG|4.0|I own all the James Bond movies on DVD.  I got this as soon as it came out.  I'm a die-hard Sean Connery-is-the-best-Bond fan, but I'm starting to think Daniel Craig is closer to Ian Fleming's vision: a non-English-looking wolf with a cruel mouth.  The movie is good, not great, for 2 flaws: the fight scenes in the dark are too hard to see, and some characters have lines which they slur with an accent you can't understand.  The Director of this film gets in his own way.  The Tosca gun shoot-out was over the top.  The opening car chase is way, way great, very realistic.  This is the second movie where you can't see who's punching or killing who with fights in the dark, with the exceptions being the knife fight in the apartment and the scaffold fight, however:  jiggling and jerking the camera around is not a substitute for good action and stunts.  I think the stunts were there, just poorly filmed.  Too bad, because the director has a lot of talent, but like a good author, you shouldn't even know that he's there.

0307454894|5.0|This is one story that has levels upon levels, or is it meanings that multiply.  The story is simple enough: boy meets girl, boy loses girl, boy tries to get along without, girl comes back, boy loses girl.  At first, being a guy, I felt that his love affair was not out of the norm or bad, but when she left, it created a very big hole for him.  Then, during the trail, I thought that the problems were with the guilt and whatnot of being German after World War II: were all those people guilty just by being there?  Truly the bad people who were cruel or sadistic deserved punishment, but what of the others, who did what they were told, following orders, or who just watched neighbors being taken away, were they so guilty, as well?  In the end, it is presented that he was abused, just as any girl might have been, and it affected him.  He did not even realize it, but there it was throughout his life, she hovered and poked at him.   I am sure that there are meanings I have not understood or seen, but it still affected me as a great story would.   I saw the movie first and thought there should have been more to it, so I read the book to find out.    Addendum:  After listening to the author discuss this book on a radio show, I got to thinking how I had missed the point of the story, but on rereading this review, I see I did not miss it by much.  His point was the guilt of the German people was also for loving to those who committed the atrocities of World War II.  How can you love them?  How can they be accepted back into society so easily?  These were more serious questions in the Fifties and Sixties since there were guilty ones still around and the next generation was getting to know them, to understand somehow they must answer these questions.  The timeliness may be passed for them, but it is still here for those who have murderers, rapist or other criminals in their circle of family or acquaintances.  It is quite a huge question to be answered privately sooner or later.

B001F0RA4S|5.0|This is an amazing book. It is poetically written and some of the proses are just sooo beautiful. The movie is awesome because of the soundtrack, which was really fantastic and goes well with the movie. However, the book is much clearer so you wont be confused by the plots and sequences. I'll def recommend it because it's one of those books that can make your heart sing because of the way it's written...
B000683VI4|5.0|Prepare yourself for one of the best love stories around.  This story will make you laugh, cry and fall in love with the characters.  It has an ending that you do not expect but eventually think it could not have ended any other way.  I loved this movie.
B001NFNFNU|4.0|Jolie is, as always, brilliant. Though I don't particularly agree with her politics, I love her acting.<br /><br />The movie is very dry, which made it all the more appealing to me. I knew before I bought it that it was set in the 20s/30s, and I expected it to be dry and boring.<br /><br />It is dry, but it isn't boring. I won't do any spoilers here, but I will say there was a point in the movie that I incidentally put my hand over my mouth and said, \\"Dear God.\\" At that point, I found the movie so upsetting that I almost didn't finish it.<br /><br />It's very well worth watching. There isn't any graphic violence, other than what you might see in your mind. If you have a weak stomach for films like this, there may be a couple of parts you need to fast-forward.
B0002A2WDQ|5.0|I recommend this movie to anyone who loves music.  The last scene of the movie is the best part and will have you on your feet.  This movie is a classic!
0060527986|1.0|Coming from one of my very favorite authors, this collection of common place and banality is really depressing.<br />This book tries to be a modern Bushido but it doesn't reach the level of Bushido's knees.<br />Bushido took almost three centuries to be perfected, maybe Master Coelho had to give his Warrior a little more time. Light is a very powerful entity, it shouldn't be treated like a fast money making commodity.

Even for ones who consider this view a trivially self-evident truth, this book provides some new tidbits here along with plenty of rather amusing examples.

It was a double bill, Texas Chainsaw Masacre, and then the Evil Dead, the   cost of admission: $2.00  So if You want your Girlfriend or Wife to be Clinging to You like Super Glue, Lower the Light's, Blaze Up some Candles and put The Evil Dead in   the DVD player. It's just a Great Horror Movie.

1416534822|2.0|After a stoic try I put this book in the donate pile after about 250 or so pages. I just really didn't care what happened to Lisey and in a way I know exactly what will happen to her although I won't finish this book. I was drawn back to King after a many year abscence when I finished Duma Key and LOVED it. He said that Lisey's Story was his story about marriage while Duma was his story about divorce so I figured I'd make the full circle but I,in no way, cared about Lisey and Scott as I had for Edgar and the other characters in Duma.    I think I'll borrow Just After Sunset from a co-worker instead of plunking down the $18 - I'm not as trusting as I used to be.

B000HT3P7E|5.0|Why do I love this show?<br /><br />I want every character on this show to be my best friend (except Robin).  They're funny, caring, and awesome.  The actors truly have tons of chemistry, providing a quality show in a half-hour block.<br /><br />This is no generic sitcom.  Sure, it's got a laugh track and some of the banter is clich&eacute;, however, most of it is incredibly witty and heartfelt.  Ted is engaged in a genuine search for love, and I'm completely wrapped up in it.  I fell in love with the Cake Girl (Victoria, played by Ashley Williams) and was sad to see her go (it's probably why I'm not a huge fan of Robin).  This show has continuity and a compelling storyline; it simply amazes me.<br /><br />It's very quotable.  I find myself quoting with friends I've talked into watching it (who get equally hooked).  The cast is brilliant, as well as the director and writers.  Bloc Party's song: `This Modern Love' at the close of Season One clenched it for me though, dramatically building up a powerful finale I won't soon forget.  It joins the hall of fame for greatest season finale songs with the likes of The O.C's: Imogen Heap `Hide and Seek' and Grey's Anatomy's: Snow Patrol `Chasing Cars'.<br /><br />Hands down, this is the best sitcom I've ever seen.  Buy it, watch it, love it.<br /><br />DISCLAIMER: Though the writers are good at what they do, don't listen to any of their commentaries.  They are exceptionally boring, lackluster, and have slightly soured my enjoyment of the show.  It's that bad.
B001GM28HO|4.0|Being original in this day and age is tough. Clearly. I think music listeners are grasping this fact more readily nowadays or else Lady Gaga wouldn't even be around right now. While Lady Gaga isn't original, she brings an interesting sound to the table full of pounding basslines, synthesizers galore, crazy vocal distortions, and some relatively good vocals to boot. When you can surround the listener with this much action, we'll be a bit more forgiving of lack of originality.<br /><br />It's pretty clear Lady Gaga is here to do two things.<br />1. Make dancefloor ready music.<br />2. Use extremely racy lyrics.<br /><br />Make no mistake, racy lyrics are nothing new. Just look at Britney Spears and Christina Aguilera primarily. Yet Ms. Gaga's voice is so different from the afforementioned singers and her beats are so good that it doesn't matter. These songs aren't anything most regular people are going to relate to, which is fine. They're fun...at first. By the end of the CD you know basically exactly what to expect which hurts the overall product.<br /><br />If you only care about the music, nothing else, this CD is sure to please. There isn't any major missteps as far as the songs go, keeping a pretty steady pace throughout the entire CD. The first single, Poker Face, is still a good all around song, as is her current single, Just Dance. Other immediate standouts are Lovegame, Eh Eh (Nothing Else I Can Say), The Fame, Paper Gangsta, and I Like It Rough. The other songs are consistent with the feel of the CD so as not to drag down any spot of the duration.<br /><br />Lady Gaga is one of those artists that you can't say someone else will like. I really enjoy her but I have friends who cannot stand her. So if you'll enjoy this CD or not is all about your taste in music. For me though, I'll keep recommending it. While The Fame isn't a big departure from other things out right now, it's interesting enough to check out for sure.
B001FSDOZO|1.0|This band is vile! I cannot stand to hear their music whats so ever, but just when you thought it couldnt get any worse, they let Mutt Lange bring in his cheesy pop sound just to make it that much worse. This album with the rest of Nickelback's albums are the equivalent of 2+2=4, its just so easy and boring and every knuckle head person listens to it and thinks its pure gold! Please stop making albums or at least every NickelBack fan should be put on one island so the rest of us never have to be abused with this bad music.

B0019T9FL6|5.0|I Have been a fan of Jennifers ever since her audition on American Idol.  It is amazing at the success and popularity we have all seen since Idol.  She can ONLY be compared to the greatest singers of all time including Whitney Houston, Patti Labelle and Aretha Franklin.  Most others pale in comparison.<br /><br />This album is a perfect debut for her.  Not only does it show her versatility as a singer but it solidifies her as a force to acknowledge in the music business.  If anyone had a doubt to her ability as a vocalist, need only listen to this album and be blown away!<br /><br />Aside from maybe 2 or 3 songs that could have been omitted, the other songs that are good are really really good.  If This Isn't Love, Invisible, Spotlight, We Gon Fight and Giving Myself to name just a few, are amazing.  This album demonstrates her as the best singer of her generation.<br /><br />This album gets 5 stars for its versatility and amazing vocals by one of the best singers of all time. Congradulations for the Best R&B Album for 2009 Grammys and 3 NAACP Awards aswell!  This is a must buy for R&B and Pop music lovers.
0321525655|5.0|I've been doing several presentations and talks in the last couple of months (such as the last few Mini Web Design Conference), and I realized I needed to sharpen my presentation skills. That's why when I got a hold of Prezentation Zen by Garr Reynolds, I was quite pleased.<br /><br />But I was more pleased after reading it, because the contents are really, really helpful and inspiring- to the point that I look forward to making presentations the same way there are Los Angeles Lakers games on TV.<br /><br />The book is divided in to three major parts: the preparation for the presentation, the design of your presentation materials (powerpoint & keynote slides, etc.), and the delivery of the presentation. All three major parts are tied together with the Zen philosophy and approach. This approach is all about simplicity and absense of noise. The book is very good in imparting these points in all the three parts.<br /><br />The book was also able to give me a new mindset when it comes to designing my presentations, like the importance of integrating the appropriate images into the presentation and the use of space and the simplification of points for the audience's easier understanding. There are also sample presentations slides for additional reference.<br /><br />Presentation Zen is definitely one of those books that won't gather dust on my bookshelf because I'll always refer to it whenever I'll make presentations.
1401300529|4.0|I was little conflicted with this book - there were times I could not put it down and it was a real page turner.  There were also times I found it overly verbose and a complete bore.  When Halberstam wrote about the war, the battles and the retreats I found he excelled at this.  You felt as though you were there with Co. Freeman, Lt. McGee or General Walker. You felt these officer's leadership, their desperation...  The writings of the various battles were exciting.   This book was a partial history of the war - it covered roughly a year and 1/2 of it up to the stalemate.    But it was also a history of the politics and times.  Halberstam covers all the major players, Atchinson, Truman, MacArthur, Mao, Stalin, Rusk....  the list was endless.  He typically attributed a chapter a piece for each politico involved.  At times, I felt is was far more detail then need be about each player.  It would get to the point where I would be saying to myself, enough about (for example) Chaing or the China Lobby, let's get back to the story at hand.  Overall, way too many side bars and sometimes too much details.  The book covered a lot, sometimes too much. US foreign policy, the containment of communism, MacCarthism...  I would have preferred to stick more to the war.    Only about 50% of the book is dedicated to the war.  The other 50% is towards the politics of the era.  Some of the author's heroes were Truman, Walton Walker, Ridgeway, the Chinese, Freeman, McGee, OP Smith.  He viewed MacArthur, Ned Almond, Chaing with pure disdain.  Definitely worth the read, it has definitely wet my appetite to do more reading on the Korean war.
0812977246|4.0|Arkady Renko is an investigator for the militia in Moscow during d&eacute;tente when three bodies are found in the snow in Gorky Park.  He knows their murders were not the usual crimes of passion because their fingertips and their faces have been removed.  There are two men, both shot through the heart and the head, and a woman with a bullet through her heart.  His investigation reveals no missing persons, and Arkady is certain the KGB will step in and take over the case when he finds reason to suspect one of their agents.  When he is kept on the case, Arkady finds himself going from merely making a show of investigating to putting everything on the line to solve it while he uncovers a web of greed and murder at the heart of a Russian national treasure.<br /><br />This is basically a police procedural, a noir story with the typical down-on-his-luck cop with a stalled career and a failing marriage.  What sets it apart is Russia.  Winston Churchill's quote about Russia being a riddle wrapped in a mystery inside an enigma is brought to life very well on these pages.  Without passing judgment, the book acerbically shows the ironies of life in communist Russia, run by an apparent people-eating machine always hungry for new victims, and often turning on itself.  Arkady Renko himself believes in socialist principles but is not a Party man, refusing to suck up to the powers that be in order to climb the ladder.  The story takes an interesting turn when he teams up with an American cop, and the book keeps going for awhile after the actual mystery is solved, showing more insights into the Russian political machine.<br /><br />Though the author's style of plunging into a scene with no introduction took a little getting used to, the book grabbed my interest fairly quickly, and it wasn't long before I was ignoring the rest of my life so I could read.  Visiting Moscow in the `80s also brought on a lot of nostalgia, as the threat of the USSR was always looming back then.  The mystery was pretty first-rate, too.  I will definitely read this author again.ate, too.  I will definitely read this author again.

B00184RQ3Q|4.0|The 5-CD set spans nearly the entire recording career of the band, as it begins with the first album for Columbia Records - Sin After Sin (1977) and speeds to the 2005 release, Angel of Retribution, which marked the return of lead vocalist Rob Halford after a 12-year absence.<br /><br />Sin After Sin was produced by Deep Purple's Roger Glover and is highlighted by a cover of Joan Baez's Diamonds & Rust, which remains a concert mainstay. The lineup - K.K. Downing and Glen Tipton (g), Halford (v), Ian Hill (b) - formed the solid nucleus, with up-and-coming drummer Simon Phillips demonstrating at age 19 that he had incredible artistic skills.<br /><br />Dave Holland is the drummer for British Steel (1980), which contains a pair of signatute numbers - Breaking the Law, Living After Midnight - while cranking out hot riffs on The Rage and Steeler. Turbo (1986) was slated to be a double-album and features guitar synthesizers as the band attempted to merge its classic metal sound with the ongoing electronic studio revolution.<br /><br />Scott Travis (d) and guest Don Airey (k) help pick up the pieces from the Turbo debacle (the remaining tracks for Twin Turbos appeared on Ram It Down [1988]) for a speed metal spectacular on Painkiller (1990). The band was in high gear, though he aftermath of a successful world tour found Halford leaving the group for a series of solo projects.<br /><br />Angel of Retribution (2005) is a \\"comeback\\" for the band in may ways; Halford came back into the fold and the strong material - Judas Rising, Revolution, Demonizer, Lochness - found the album making a strong #13 debut on the Billboard album chart.<br /><br />One of the most recognizable metal bands, the group has churned out an amazing catalog of mostly solid material for 40 years. This is a good overview of some of the biggest (and controversial) moments in JP's career.

There are times in your life when music resonates within you, and other times when the same music won't. There are times in my own past when I would have found this album to be pretentious, boring, all the other criticisms written. This however is not one of those times.    Agaetis Byrjun is my first foray into Sigur Ros. And its an extremely beautiful and compelling effort. And it is truly beautiful. It sinks into you and through you, and reminds you of many other influences. I won't list since that's not the point. This is not music you listen to while staring at the speaker waiting for something to happen. This is music you play while doing other things. It is at times powerful, at others sublime, at still others tense.    I gave it 4 stars only because at times the vocals (not the language, but the voice itself) take away from the music in my opinion. However if I could give it 4 1/2 I would. I came to this music through an enjoyment of Underworld, The Decemberists latest, even Rush. Music that provides a solid background for doing other things without being distracting. Ti use a cliche, you will either love this album or absolutely hate it. For me, fantastic and highly recomended.
B0012Q732O|5.0|I just watched the movie and I thought that it was really good! I read many negative reviews before I saw it and I thought it would be bad, but it wasn't! It was boring the first 15 - 20 minutes then after that, you start understanding it more. I'm guessing by reading other reviews that it is historically incorrect, but that is not what makes a movie good or bad. It has amazing special effects, great actors, wonderful plot and terrific action scenes. The only bad thing is that it only has deleted scenes as special features. The movie on Blu-ray Disc has two more features and Best Buy has a 2 Disc Special Edition and Best Buy Canada has a 3 Disc Edition with more features. Other than that, I really enjoyed it no matter what anyone else says.
6305161879|1.0|Comedies don't normally age well because there are only so many times you can hear a joke without getting sick of it and so films of that ilk normally represent sort of a time capsule of what the key events and issues of the time were that concerned people and hence what was funny to them at that time.  For those of us that are not of that time dated jokes leave us asking \\"huh?\\".<br /><br />Unfortunately, this film falls into that category and while there are a few scenes especially between Palin and Cleese that drew a smile from me in remembrance of the great Python days the rest of the film was desperately dated and had me looking at the clock wishing it would end.  1988 must also have been a very bad year for films as that would explain how Kline could win his Oscar.  Cleese is a funny actor but he is certainly not a scriptwriter.  From the opening credits that were in an off-putting deep blue to the horrible score and background music this film doesn't even begin well.  Highly overrated and a film that ages very, very poorly it isn't helped by this very poor dvd version with horrible mono sound quality and even worse picture quality that is full of white spots and other imperfections.  There are no special features to speak about like interviews or making-of documentaries as well.<br /><br />It's actually embarassing that Cleese and Palin could actually put their names to this film given the vastly superior output that they were involved in from their Python days.<br /><br />Avoid at all cost!
B001PPGAIA|5.0|I first saw the movie in a theatre.  While I go to a lot of movies, I own relatively few, primarily because after I have seen them, I don't care to watch them again.  Australia is an exception.  As we left the theatre, I told my husband, \\"when this one comes out in DVD, it will be added to our meager collection of great films.\\"  Australia is truly an epic film.  The photography is superb, the script is adequate for the story, the acting is excellent and overall, it showcases the country of Australia.  Most people are unaware of Australia's  \\"wild west\\" history nor the important role it played in World War II.  I would recommend it to anyone wanting a few hours of great entertainment and enjoyment.
B000059Z8M|5.0|Get this movie if you don't have it. It's a classic that your children will enjoy.
0446579939|5.0|This was a wonderful book. I literally read it in just two days, Once I started I couldnt stop. The frist chapters are a little slow but give you insight on each characters life. You learn the things soliders have to go through, and how symbolically this picture of the woman he had found kept him alive. A Beautiful story and a very good read. Nicholas Sparks does it again! Makes me think he must me the most romantic man in the world.
B0000062FJ|5.0|In 1969 lots of things were being changed in rock music, you had Black Sabbath that were about to explode on the scene in 1970 that defined heavy metal and you also had Santana who combined latin music with rock and came up with something special, and there first album proves it. An essential album for anyone to own who calls themselves a music lover, an amazing album.
B001KVZ6ES|5.0|Clint Eastwood should have won best actor for this movie. I can't see why in the world Sean Penn won. Clint Eastwood is the better actor far and beyond Penn. It is one of his best. Only Clint could have pulled it off.

B0000069CT|5.0|I bought what I thought was one disc of Max Bruch's violin concertos...and it turned out to be a double header. Not only a double header, but in mint condition and with all of my favorite recordings beautifully rendered.    I buy used discs often on Amazon, as does one of my sons. We are both music addicts and have been very happy with our purchases.
B001KVZ6F2|5.0|As far back as I can remmember going to a Clint Eastwood film has always in itself represented a warranty for watching something decent at the very least. After UNFORGIVEN came out, there were plenty of just OK films like SPACE COWBOYS, ABSOLUTE POWER, TRUE CRIME and the like but recent years have come with an Eastwood streak of fantastic hits which is just amazing considering the guy will be 80 next year. My personal favorite will always be the said UNFORGIVEN but GRAN TORINO is definetely in my top 5 favorite Eastwoods. The sight of the boy driving the car by the lake at the very end should have you smiling from ear to ear. Just great.
141690977X|4.0|ok-I was skeptical at first about this book.  But I bought just to see what the big fuss was all about.  And to my surprise I could not let this book down.    I couldn't believe all the stories.  Of course, I read about myself in them too!  I always felt in my earlier years I took crap from guys and that's why I'm I feel much stronger now.  I have to admit too that I know I'm in a dead-end relationship and that's got to go.    I rather be by myself than to waste my time when I could be with someone that can give more happiness!!!
B001ED7C58|5.0|I got the CD after reading Twilight and before seeing the movie. I've grown to love all the songs on the CD.  I watched the movie recently and was surprised there wasn't more of the songs played on it, though even after reading the book I enjoyed the movie very much.
B001K555F4|4.0|Dude are you nuts! I love John Legend and Andre 3000 songs. But nobody is going paid $68.00 for a cd that just came out last year dude. Now I don't know its this your April fool jokes or what. But what a dumb deal.
1878424505|5.0|This book is an excellent source for a practical way of living an emotionally healthy life. Miguel Ruiz puts four simple things into easy to understand terminology. It was recommended by my career coach and I would recommend it to anyone that is looking for better communication skills or perhaps a refresher on how to live happier and add value to your life from a different perspective.
B001N26GFM|5.0|I saw this movie two days ago, and its images still haunt me.  That men could treat each other so unjustly, and judge them so unfairly both saddens and angers me.  I hope that many will watch and all will learn something new about themselves during the course of this film.
0743454537|4.0|This is an excellent read with a real-life dilemna presented in a solide and rather suspenseful manner.  With medical research and genetic engineering often in the press, the outlying ramifications of such technology is brought to light in this story. The family relationships, the idea of 'responsibility', the way the individual characters handle a chronic and life-threatening illness and potential salvation are all worthy food-for-thought.  This would make for a wonderful discussion with teens - except for a gratuitous sexual encounter that is simply not appropriate for the teen audience that might otherwise gain from this story.  I'm sorry that Ms. Picoult felt it necessary to include that bit - it simply wasn't necessary to the story or character development.
0060730552|5.0|Very heart jumping book.  Keeps you on the edge of every page.  Worth the read.
B001N26GFC|2.0|Someones acceptance of this movie totally hinges on their tolerance of Sally Hawkins character.  If you are charmed by goofy, never stop talking British eccentrics then you may like Happy Go Lucky.    If people who never shut up annoy you, people who will say anything just to be saying something, then this probably ain't the movie for you.    I was surprised because I'm a big Mike Leigh fan.  Life is Sweet is an all time favorite and was far more off center and weird than Happy Go Lucky.  It had plenty of weird characters that all became endearing and real by the end.  I kept waiting for Hawkins character to become lovable the way the mom did in Life is Sweet, the way the bloviating Jim Broadbent did in Topsy-Turvy.  Never happens.  Happy Go Lucky by contrast is filled with a mix of either annoying characters (Hawkins, driving instructor, Flamenco instructor) or dull characters (co-workers, boyfriend, abused student, roommate).      Leigh's penchant for not working off of scripts goes wrong in this one and turns the movie into a bunch of patched together skits that do little to build a cohesive whole.  It's telling that the best scene in the movie, her encounter with a homeless man, is the only time she has very little to say.  Unfortunately, the scene is compromised because it is a totally forced situation.  Just as in a slasher movie where people always do stupid things to get themselves killed, we are expected to accept that someone would actually walk down a dark alley in a bad neighborhood at night in hopes of making an interesting acquaintance.  It reeks of plot device and undermines the scene.    The movie gets a 93% on Rotten Tomatoes, Hawkins won a Golden Globe and universal acclaim.  So obviously, I'm not seeing something everyone else did.  You may want to rent it and judge for yourself...
B000GUJZ4G|5.0|How can you beat both Patrick & Keanu in the same surfer flick?  You can't.  This is a great movie.
B000J103OI|4.0|Just picked up a dvd of this movie and it's so much tamer than the book.  What a horrifyingly stupid decision for the writers to make Miranda Priestly a sympathetic character, from boo-hooing about her divorce to privately smiling in fond satisfaction at her protege's progress. . . . after deliberately snubbing Andrea as she got into her car!  I mean, come on.  She never would have felt ANYTHING but annoyed contempt for her assistant; the girl was nothing to her but a slave to bully and denigrate.   A mean person is a mean person is a mean person - - there is nothing amusing, sympathetic, or even particularly human about such virulently nasty people.  I know that because I worked for a toxic boss  over 10 years ago, back in the days before academia would have called someone like on the carpet for her atrociously cruel abuse of the adminstrative staff.  She was a sociopath.  Sure, she was bitter and unhappy, but did we pity her for her misery?  No, everyone despised, feared, and resented her, and most of them toadied to her in terrified genuflecting awe, as if the sun rose and set on that old bat.  And that, my friends, is how Bosses From Hell Get Away With It.      The novel Devil Wears Prada is exactly what that author went through; if it isn't the truth it's pretty close to it - - no one could make such ghastly incidents up.  That roman a clef was written for a reason, but notice how NO ONE in the dvd's bonus featurettes discussed whom the character was REALLY based on, and how all the interviewss breathlessly decreed that they were going to treat the fashion industry with \\"respect.\\"  What, were the New York designers going to hire thugs to go beat up the producers, directors, writers and actors who made this movie?  Threaten to have their careers ruined?  Make sure that they \\"never ate lunch in this town again\\"?   What in blue blazes was everyone so AFRAID of?  During the filmed interviews of the people who made this movie, they all but looked over their shoulders while they talked, the whites of their eyes showing in terror.    That said, this was an absolutely scrumptuous movie to watch as far as clothes, scenery, snide confrontations. . . . but if only the character of Andrea had fought back more or somehow retaliated, instead of being so nicey-nice to all those vicious clacking fashionistas who snubbed, berated, and insulted her. That tray of dishes hurled into the sink - Miranda's suddenly unwanted lunch - - should have been hurled at her over-coiffed head.

B00127RAJY|5.0|I love this workout!  It is great with strength training and aerobic exercise.  And when you think you are starting to get in a routine, it's easy to up the challenge by going up to the next level!  I really notice a difference and am starting to feel like I'm in shape!
B001F0VHEM|2.0|I was so looking forward to getting this CD based on \\"So What\\" and \\"Sober\\".  I'm recently divorced and thought that this would be my anthem CD - you know to get me pscyhed to go out on the town, as a new single.  I was disappointed however that besides \\"So What\\" and \\"Bad Influence\\" most of the song are sad , I wish I had my husband back crap.  Not really what I was expecting, and my skip button on my dash is going to probably break from overuse.  All in all I should have just downloaded the three songs that I liked and saved the $12.  Better luck next time Pink.
B000WMFZMY|5.0|I received the video on time and it was new. It is a classic movie which both my husband and i have enjoyed again after so many years. The price for the movie such as this was great.  Thank you Amazon.
0143034901|4.0|Zafon's Shadow of the Wind starts out strong and hooked me early...always a good sign. Our Spanish protagonist Daniel is swept into a mystery over the author of a series of obscure books. He's pursued by an even more mysterious figure who is trying to destroy the very books that Daniel has become enamored of. And there's the mystery: what became of the author? Who's pursuing Daniel? Why is someone destroying these books?<br /><br />At first, it seemed as though this was going to be a tale with twists of magical realism. Instead, it turned out to be a fairly straight forward love story (albeit with a complicated, twisting plot). Expecting something slightly supernatural, I was a little disappointed by this. However, it's a well-written tale and entertaining enough.
B001PPLIEG|1.0|After watching all of the Bond films from Dr. No to Die Another Day, including Never Say Never Again, and then watching Casino Royale, I thought \\"Good lord, they can't make another Bond film as bad as this\\", but they have in Quantum of Solace. Not only does it bring in all the inaccuracies of Casino Royale i.e. cell phones and other modern technology as well as M being a woman, but there is no real storyline. It is not a Bond film, it is 102 minutes of explosions and gunfire. Bond films have always, until Casino Royale, had just the right amount of action and story. Hopefully this will be the last Bond movie with Daniel Craig. Casino Royale and Quantum of Solace ruined James Bond.     Do not buy this DVD unless you are 8 years old and all you care about is CGI and no story.
031606792X|5.0|I am shocked to see how many people didn't like this book.  Why? Because everyone got what they wanted and nobody died at the end?  People, that is why I read.  Real life is sad enough.  Why can't everyone get what they want in a book since it will never happen in real life.    This is why I loved the fourth book.    1) A large portion was written from Jacob's perspective (who happens to be my favorite character in the whole series.)  I do like Bella, but she really annoys me as a character at times with the whole silent martyr thing.  So I loved being able to read from Jacob's point of view.    2) Bella and Jacob's relationship finally makes sense.  The other books lead up this.  It was like Jacob was meant to be part of Bella's life somehow, he just wasn't meant to end up with Bella. So when he imprinted on Renesme I was so happy for him.  Finally he wouldn't be tortured anymore and he and Bella could be best friends again.  3) Once Bella became a vampire she didn't annoy me anymore.  I loved the relationship between her and Edward.  Edward could finally not have to worry about killing her all the time.    Anyway I could go on and on.  I loved this book.  It was by far my favorite.  I cried even.  So there.  Haters.
B001N18HP0|3.0|Ten was & still is one great album. The \\"Redux/Remastered\\" version gives us a mix closer to Vs. & Vitalogy (i.e., the reverb/echo is gone). I really appreciate having both mixes because the original sounds closer to a concert and the Redux is closer to what we are used to from the later albums. Kudos to Brendan O'Brien's work.    Now the bad news - both the remastered CD and Redux version CD are hyper-compressed to make them sound louder - while reducing the overall music dynamics. Take a look at the comparision between the original Ten and the 2 newer discs at [...] (thanks to Dave Mack for the link).    As you can see, the newer versions look like a \\"brick\\" (i.e., white noise). If you think that music should look like a brick, then stop reading now. I really need to know who decided to do this to the CD versions. Bob Ludwig from Gateway Mastering handled the master and his position on the ridiculous \\"loudness war\\" is clearly stated here [...]    Brendan O'Brien's work is so good he had to know that compressing the mix to get it louder just ruins the overall sound. I have to believe it was the producers and that Pearl Jam simply trusted them to put it together.    Maybe Pearl Jam really only listened to the LP. The good news is that the LP versions are not hyper-compressed (the LP had a separate master compared to the CD); however, the LP versions does not ship w/ the Unplugged DVD, which is an amazing and long sought after session. The DVD sounds great and as with most DVDs, it is not hyper-compressed.    For more information regarding the \\"Loudness Wars\\", check out the above links and [...]

B001M5UDGS|5.0|An aspiring villian with visions of disrupting the status quo and curing the world's ills (by taking over, of course) is trying to get into the Evil League of Evil, defeat his nemisis Captain Hammer, and win the heart of the fair Penny from the laundromat.  And Dr. Horrible, Captain Hammer, and Penny sing about all this.<br /><br />The basic premise didn't bode well, but the execution made up for everything.  Neil Patrick Harris had a suprisingly good singing voice (started to type 'sinning' voice, and that would have been equally apropos) and could switch from the ambitious but inexperienced Dr. Horrible to his alter ego Billy very smoothly, and created a captivating and likeable (even at his evilist) personna throughout the movie.  Nathan Fillion as Captain Hammer was brilliant; he played the self-absorbed and vacuous hero beautifully.  Felicia Day as Penny was caught in the middle of this and really brought the altruistic and slightly naive character to life.<br /><br />My only complaint was that it was over too quickly.<br /><br />E.M. Van Court

0312330537|5.0|I was surprised to enjoy myself being immersed in this world in this book. I picked it up because I was interested in the way the book came to be.  I couldn't put it down because of the story.    The book is written in a perfectly frail first-person, taking the reader up with bouyant self-satisfaction when the narrator is trying to overcome inner weakness, and contemplative effacing insight when the narrator is peaceful with himself, and most strong. But the real gems in this book are the other characters, whom we come to love and respect or loath and suspect not because the narrator told us how to feel, but how they unfold in his life.  While many of these characters are more lovable than our narrator, one has to come to love him in the end, for seeing, feeling and writing this constellation of characters for us.   And along the way the narrator shows, without telling, how a path to redemption can be sick and twisted, unworthy, random, and in the end perhaps very unjust, but by that time we, even more so than our narrator, have come to question justice, fate, evil to accomplish good and good that enables evil.

0446581348|5.0|i was mixed about buying this after reading the reviews but i looked at it in a bookstore and i'm glad i did. it's an excellent piece of work. it covers everything you can imagine about makeup, how to apply, tools, getting into the business, you name it. what thing i found particularly helpful was the troubleshooting tips. i didn't understand why certain things happened such as creasing concealor under the eye, bobbi brown says that applying enough product and the right way should take care of this. she discusses a lot about undertones which i found helpful because i didn't really know about that and since i'm venturing out in to mineral makeup i wanted to know more about my undertones to get a good match. she also discusses skin care routines and which are more appropriate for the various skin types.    i had one other bobbi brown book but this really can be a one stop reference guide for anyone interested in makeup. some of the negative reviews focus on the fact that she discusses things in her other books or basics about brushes, etc. in all fairness, there are some things that really should be included in any makeup book (i have several and they all discuss brushes, etc.) also, i think she does have a lot of the basics, which is what most women are curious about but she also went into some different and more artistic looks. she even talks about makeup application differences between someone being photgraphed in black and white vs. color. i feel like i studied this book as opposed to just read it. i feel like the content will be just as relevant 5-10 years from now as it is today so for that it was worth it to me. granted someone that has spent years in the business might not get a lot out of this but for someone who is just starting out, wanting to improve their techniques and see some great tips or just learn about the business side of this then you'll be happy with this one.    i just want to note that the photograpy is great and there is a lot of representation of all kinds of ethnicities, it doesn't feel slanted towards one ethnicity like some makeup books are. in particular there's a picture of a beautiful white woman with a small gap in her teeth. i found this to be one of the best pictures in the book. the woman looked unique and her makeup was nicely done, it was a nice photograph.
B001PU8N0I|5.0|I too, am watching it on OPB right now and I consider it to be enthralling, romantic, and emotional.  The scenery, costumes, actors, and effects are all wonderful.  It is great to be able to turn on the TV and watch something wholesome and well-made, not to mention classic! Everyone who appreciates literature and societies of time gone by need to tune in!
B001GZ6QC4|1.0|I was given this movie as a gift.  I didn't get all the through it before destroying it and throwing it away (I wouldn't want anyone else having to suffer through it on my account)!  This is an all-to-typical example of Hollywood trash advertised as \\"something big.\\"  The plot line was flat and disjointed (or totally incoherent in some spots), the acting just ok, and the character development - well, there was none.  The writers, if I can call them that, had the police doing things that no normal police agency would dream of doing!    All in all this is a pathetic movie for adults to have made and I would hope that all involved in its production are sufficiently embarassed.  However, if it were a junior high movie project I probably would have given it a higher score.  In short, don't waste your time let alone money in viewing this garbage!
B0015ABRE2|5.0|Dexter was a plesant little surprise for me when it debuted on Showtime a few years ago, and it doesn't slow down one bit in its third season.  Season three of Dexter kicks off with our serial killer protagonist (Michael C. Hall) doing what he does while still questioning the code bestowed on him by his late foster father Harry (James Remar).  It isn't long before Rita (Julie Benz) has some surprising news for Dex, and the surprises keep coming with the arrival of Miguel Prado (Jimmy Smits), an ADA who forms an unlikely friendship with Dex, and has some secrets of his own to boot.  What makes Dexter so good in the first place is that we never quite know which direction the series will take, and there's enough genuine surprises and great moments to continue to help make the series the best show on premium cable TV today.  Hall remains simply magnetic in the title role, while there's still great supporting work from Jennifer Carpenter, David Zayas, and Lauren Valez as Dex's co-workers, whom are still unaware of his extracurricular activities.  The season ends on a note that I wasn't too fond of at first, but it's fitting in the darkly quirky way that the show has been since day one, and really sets up some possible bigger developments to come in the future.  All in all, if you've never seen Dexter before, you have been quite sadly missing out, and you should give it a chance at the very least on DVD.
B000I2J6K0|5.0|I was just going through some reviews and I was amazed by some comments from women that are only 6 or 8 weeks pregnant and they complain that the video is too hard... come on people I'm 20 weeks pregnant and I have no problem doing it. It's fun doing it, it's not boring like other exercise videos, you don't look at the clock every minute hoping it will soon end, and you actually work all your muscle groups. I personally LOVE IT!!!
B00127RAJY|5.0|I had never heard of Jillian Michaels nor have I ever watched The Biggest Loser. I was surfing Amazon and looking for a great workout dvd and I got way more than I bargained for. All of the reviews for this dvd are in my opinion very accurate.   I am 20 years old, 5'8\\" and 150lbs. I wouldn't consider myself fat but I definitely know that I'm not healthy. I was getting short of breath just walking up a couple flights of stairs!!   I am on my second day of the shred and I can tell you that my shoulders ache and my calves burn.. but in a good way.   Jillian pushes you to keep going! She is an awesome motivator and since I don't have a reliable gym partner Jillian is perfect. She tells you that \\"we're in this together\\" and tells you that the results you want don't come for free and she's right! At one point she says \\" I know you want to quit. I know you want to turn off this dvd, but you've gotta push yourself!\\"   I whole heartedly recommend this dvd. If you aren't sure about it go to youtube and you can watch clips of it. I watched clips from level one.   I would like to lose 10 pounds and trim up all over and I believe that this dvd is going to help me make exercising a regular part of my day.
0841601615|5.0|The book is wonderfully illustrated and very well written. The author clearly loves shoes and the people who make them. In addition to the nuts and bolts of shoemaking, the book teaches us about style and history along the way - A really great read and a terrific resource.
B000YRY8BG|5.0|Although we struggled with the Manchester accent, this didn't deter us from really, really enjoying the miniseries. The acting was great and the plot moved quickly. We spent a lot of time discussing the events and trying to unravel the whys and wherefores. That's what a good movie is all about. The character Dominic was a bit overdone because he started out as a sort of comical feature of the story but as it moved on he became a pathetic victim. The writers could have improved this aspect of the story. Bill Nighy, however, was fantastic.   This is another keeper but to be lent out to friends.
B00137DDK8|4.0|After reading What Do You Care What Other People Think?: Further Adventures of a Curious Character by Richard Feynman, I have a better understanding of a remarkable life, and the ins and outs of science. This novel allowed the reader to be placed in the life of Richard, and first wife Arlene through fun, educational, and difficult experiences. We the readers, obtain a view of Feynman's out of the ordinary interactions with science, along with his personal life. The novel, unlike the earlier, Surely You Are Joking Mr. Feynman! is a loose collection of personal stories experienced by this creative scientist. Of the most interesting in my opinion, is Feynman's analysis of the Challenger disaster of 1986, which exploded in-flight. This creative scientist turned the disaster into a rather significant experiment of dropping rubber rings into cold water, and realizing after the misshapen objects. This is only one of many experiments described by Feynman that give science a better understanding of the world around us. Though, we also get to see what life was like for Feynman, living as a significant contributor to the scientific world. We learn of his early wife, Arlene as she battled tuberculosis near the Atomic Bomb station in Alamo, Texas.  Overall, the novel gives the reader an in-tuned view of the desirable life of Richard Feynman. I recommend What Do You Care What Other People Think?: Further Adventures of a Curious Character, to anyone interested in an off-the wall inventive read!
B000002UB3|5.0|Abbey Road was not Sgt. Pepper. Abbey Road was not Revolver. Abbey Road was not the 'White' Album.     Friends, that is what makes this album so unbelievably good. The Beatles went out on top when they released this 1969 masterpiece. Leaving behind the elaborate instrumental and vocal overdubs utilized in such great albums as Sgt. Pepper and Revolver (Note: Overdubs can be found here, but not in such copius amounts as in the aforementioned albums), The Beatles hunkered down in their cavernous EMI environment to bring their fans a bare-bones rockin' good album.     The album itself is highlighted by such tracks as the Starr-penned, \\"Yellow Submarine\\"-ish tune, \\"Octopus's Garden\\", the absolute best George Harrison material released during the Beatle years (\\"Here Comes The Sun\\" and \\"Something\\"), and the side two jam medley (\\"You Never Give Me Your Money\\" through \\"The End\\", ending with a surprise in \\"Her Majesty\\").     One doesn't need to be a Beatles fan in order to dig the hell out of this Tour de France of an album. From beginning to end, The Beatles summed up their decade-long carreer in the most authentic way possible.    Bravo boys, Bravo!
B001PPLIEG|3.0|\\"Quantum of solace\\" focuses around a real problem in the recent future. The crisis of the water in Bolivia is just an orange alarm around the rest of the world (I think to myself that we will exception witnesses in a very recent future about the creation of the OWEC(Organization of water exporting countries)).But the rest of the film as you and me may expect is made of amazing chases: by the sea, aerial, and car. However, a frantic camera that never stops from start to finish, is not able to support the numerous fissures through the film.<br /><br />Bond lacks that glamour taste: the luxuriant landscapes, the unerring casinos and the alluring women. We will miss the new futuristic devices in the vehicle of Bond. It's to say, there has been a thoughtful process of deconstruction and designed reengineering around the expensive caprices of his majesty's agent and the new paradigms in order to dissolve the touch of class and acknowledged elegance of the previous sagas.<br /><br />The risk is yours.
B000028U0Y|5.0|Of all the country artists out there, few have been able to seep into other genres as influencially as Johnny Cash, and this album makes the best case for it.    At Folsom Prison finds Johnny Cash at a new phase in both his personal and his musical carreer. Having been on a hiatus after the burdens of touring got the best of him, Johhny Cash sobered up, married June Carter, and stormed into the record comanies with the idea of recording a live album at Folsom.    At a time when country music took a lengthy backseat to the sights and sounds of the psychadelic sixties, Johhny Cash broke down the barriers and made what is perhaps one of the ten most important live recordings of all time.    Included with the package are two tracks that were previously unreleased on the vinyl edition of the album. Cash is both amusing and poignant, using humor in between and during the performances of the songs, and even performing a tune that was written by one of Folsom's captives (\\"Greystone Chapel\\"). The sheer magic of the backing vocals of the Statler Brothers on \\"Green Grass of Home\\"  brings a delight to the ears (or the speakers).    Though he has now gone on to the immortal realm of musical immortality, Johnny Cash remains as fresh and powerful as the day he first cut \\"Folsom Prison Blues\\". I can say little more about this album except for the next few words I pass onto you who are reading this review:    Buy this album. You won't regret it.
B000A2RRF4|5.0|This DVD is the recording of one of the concerts from the Bad Tour by Michael Jackson. The show itself is great. Sound and video are very good taking note of the time of the recording. This show will impress yourself with the quality of one of the best musician in history. Every great song by MJ is here.
0765342294|1.0|I think \\"Ender's Game\\" is one of the most overrated books I've ever read.  Style of writing aside, there was so little I liked about this book that I'm amazed how many people act like it was life changing.  Most critical reviews focus on the unrealistic elements of the story.  I agree, and I think it hurts the story a lot.  Ender is too smart for suspense.  Nothing challenged him.  He never failed.  Sure Card makes it seem as though he's struggling with acceptance and fear of other kids, but his situation didn't reinforce these thoughts, and you knew from the get-go that he'd have no problem figuring out what to do.  A story where the protagonist never fails is boring.  It would have been much more engaging if he'd struggled and lost in the battle room a few times, and it wouldn't have hurt the image of him as a super genius since he was contesting other geniuses with maturity and experience advantage.  Ender's extreme intelligence also made him unrelateable.  I didn't feel a connection to him because I'm not a genius and I know it.  I feel like people who think they relate to Ender are kidding themselves (exception being military personnel who relate to basic training).  I only know of a few people in history who could honestly say they understand Ender, they would be Alexander the Great, Einstein, and the other anomalies who's brilliance defies logic.  The fifteen year old who wins at Warcraft on the internet every day and thinks that makes him a genius can't claim any real bond with a character like Ender and should stop kidding himself.  And if you were hated for being a teacher's pet, remember that you chose that for yourself, Ender was singled out against his will.  For those of us who actually fail every once in a while at anything, Ender is like some mythical god.  When I realized the ending that Card was building toward I thought there was no way he'd really do that.  I was wrong, it was exactly as predicted with even less of a payoff than I could have envisioned.  No rising action, and if you didn't predict what would happen, the climax happens before you even realize it's coming.  Aweful.  Peter's little political coup was terrible.  The entire chapter could have been replaced with one sentence...\\"The children were so genius that they decided to make themselves into the most world's powerful political figures using the internet.\\"  That and it doesn't relate to the plot at all.  Had I known that I would have just skipped that absurdly long chapter.  In short, for a book with a highly unrealistic and essentially boring character, weak plot, no rising conflict or climax, and a giant chunk of wasted paper, this book gets way too much praise.  I don't recommend it to anyone over the age of thirteen.
B0019HQIGS|5.0|I can watch this concert almost everyday. Not only I can listen the CD all day long, John Mayer is also great to watch while he is playing the guitar. The concert is very complete, with lot of backstage footage. Will always be in my collection. I love this concert. Buy now
B001MYIXAC|5.0|Oh, my. Horror fans, please stand back for just a moment.<br />This film is foremost an expertly crafted tale of friendship between Ellie and Oskar. Although they are both lonely and only 12 - Ellie has been 12 for a very long time - together they learn the value of trust, compassion, and the elusive ability to support a friend no matter what.<br />The horror element is delivered in spades. Both on camera and the startling depiction of things we are compelled to do to merely survive.<br />Hollywood will NOT be able to improve upon this haunting film.
B001HDO4Z6|2.0|Thought I was ordering a regular CD.  It came in a cardboard cover with only a few songs on it. I returned it a few weeks ago and have had no e-mail or correspondence about my return status.
0956010903|5.0|I have been a zealous Harry Potter fan since I was in 7th grade, but nonetheless I was hesitant about making such an expensive purchase. Now I am extremely glad I did, the tales included in the book are both witty and enjoyable. And the notes \\"written\\" by Dumbledore, well they are written by Dumbledore nothing need be added!! This is testemant to the every-growing creativity of J.K.Rowling. And for her to use it for such a noble cause makes it all the better.    Now content aside, let us talk about the actual edition. The book arrived very well packaged so it came without a single mark. The large faux-book case is beautiful and is only surpassed by the actual book insid ; the silver ornaments are truly fantastic.     All in all, this was a great item to start my amazon shopping days with. I absolutely adore it inside and out. And if you can get your hands on a copy then by all means DO IT. You cannot go amiss whether young or adult.
B000KKPN5C|5.0|just received it..I have always had the heavy flash units. this is nice because it is light...works well with my Nikon d70.
B00127RAJY|4.0|I really like that you do work HARD for the 20 minute workout, but I also like that Jillian really does a good job on explaining movements and how to do them so you don't get hurt. Whenever I've done lunges in the past, my knees have always hurt, but Jillian explains the proper technique and I'm able to do them.
B00005OAIE|5.0|I never get tired of listening to this CD over and over!  It is amazing.  Of all the John Mayer CD's, this one is a favorite!
B0002EQ7EC|5.0|Believe it or not, this album received mixed reviews, creating a bizarre Pro-Graceland(+ Anti-'Saints'...) vs. Pro-Saints 'Which is better?' war that continues to this day. So naturally I am always incensed when I discover yet another listener who fails to 'get' the sheer genius that frankly saturates this album. The South American rhythms are infectious. Having heard (and of course loved) Graceland before buying this one, after about 3 listens it'd clicked - I now consider 'Saints' to be the winner by a nose.    The chorus of She Moves On, for example, although essentially very different in style, is melodically a clear match for the beautiful 'Under African Skies' on Graceland. The layering of xylophones (or some similar percussion instrument!) in Can't Run But, I distinctly remember finding breathtaking on my first listen, and it still never fails to impress. (A song that leaves you sort of mesmerized when it's finished, like you've just woken up from a strange dream.) Spirit Voices - frankly left me speechless, and that's not even mentioning the empowering optimism of tracks like Thelma, The Obvious Child, Born At The Right Time, and Cool, Cool River (see Paul Simon's Concert In The Park for the best versions of these latter 2).    Lyrically, Simon is stronger than ever. There's simply not enough space to quote all the gems here, but one particular favorite of mine: \\"I watch you sleeping in the hospital bed / The baby curled up in a ball / Winter sunlight hits the family tree / And everything else becomes nothing at all.\\" [Thelma]  Four lines is apparently all Mr. Simon needs to describe the indescribable sense of awe and perspective one feels after the birth of their first child! I'm not the sentimental type, but this one struck a chord with me.    And of course:  \\"Down by the riverbank / A blues band arrives / The music suffers / The music business thrives\\" [Can't Run But]  The album is littered with lyrical gems throughout (Cool Cool River also springs to mind just off the top of my head), but as with all great music, these are undoubtedly much better heard in their intended context than simply read.    In terms of the rhythm and instrumentation, it's overflowing with delicate complexities, many of the tracks strike that extremely rare balance of being potentially either drifted off to or scrutinously analysed by music scholars for years to come.    This is not for the generic 'throwaway' listener; it's a record that rewards commitment. 3 or more play-throughs whilst doing something significant (for me it was my summer paper route when I was 15! A vacation drive'll do just fine though ;) to really take in all that is going on here, and ultimately find a fitting backdrop for what is definitely music for the open air.    Rhythm Of The Saints may have missed out on the 'popular' vote, but it's an invaluable triumph for the exploration of music and artistic integrity. Arguably the best $11 I ever spent and has enriched my life [repeatedly] ever since. Think of the perfect summer album, then go beyond that. This is it.
0321543726|5.0|If you're looking to learn C++, this is the book. Written by the creator of the language, it makes the effort to impress the importance of understanding memory management early on, which I think is fabulous- Don't get me started on C programmers without a functional knowledge of pointers. And as a reference for changes to the standard (as well as patchy spots in memory) it works quite well. An excellent purchase.
B001PJRAUS|5.0|I have seen this twice on Oxygen and each time I find something new and funny and wonderful about this remake of Pride and Prejudice.  While I love the Austen novels and feel that the Colin Firth version was quite close to the book, this one is so much fun! I can relate to Amanda when she says, \\"every time I have been with someone, it was you (Darcy)...\\" to paraphrase.  I know that I have longed for a modern man who could be more like Mr. Darcy, so I'm so glad that this was made.  If I can't find my own Mr. Darcy, at least I can revel in Amanda's escapades!  I hope you love this movie as much as I do!
B0001CCY7E|5.0|I loved this music when I saw the original film debut, and this 2nd version of the CD is a wonderful treatment to a fantastic soundtrack. It is crystal clear from a production standpoint. The music itself is full-on stirring, dramatic, and moving, depending on the cut. You can see in your mind's eye the beautiful plains scenery, the brutal indian attack, the courting and falling in love between Dunbar and Stands-With-Fist, and the majestic buffalo when you play the corresponding track. You can also appreciate that John Barry does not get enough credit as a wonderful screen composer -- this is one you've got to own!
B000SO7OMA|5.0|We visited the Alhambra on a trip to Spain ... what an unbelieveably awesome back drop for Loreena's haunting melodies ... and the never seen before instruments ... it literally brought tears to my husband's eyes and gave me chills!  We play it for guests and everyone has reacted the same way!
B001CTDH4Y|4.0|This is a one sided DVD (possibly dual layer).  Therefore, in order to select wide-screen you have to navigate to some menus.   I almost returned it because there wasn't a very clear indication that both formats were squeezed onto one side.  I suspect a lot of DVDs do this, but this is the first time I've run into it as being so unclear.  Even the laser inscription on the inner circle didn't provide a clue.
0061684384|4.0|love the book, she has a great life story going, can't wait to for the next \\"chapter\\"
B001GKJ2DY|2.0|This movie, like \\"Across the Universe\\", seeks to create a plot which overlays the hit songs of a musical group.  Mamma Mia is set on a Greek island, where a young girl is about to get married and wants to have her father present for the wedding.  Unfortunately, she has been able to narrow the paternalistic possibilities down to three men and no further.  Her mother, who raised her in a hotel she owns on the island, has revealed nothing to her about her parentage.  The daughter secretly writes to the three candidates whose names she discovers in her mother's diary.<br /><br />Fine so far.  If only the characters had not been so vapid...the singing so excrutiatingly awful.  I've enjoyed Pierce Brosnan in plenty of other movies, but I'm afraid his singing will force you out of the room.<br /><br />As for Meryl Streep's two old pals who show up for the event, they reminded me of aging characters from \\"Grease\\" who never grew up.  The child bride is a giddy airhead who certainly is not capable of carrying the movie as a main character.<br /><br />Streep and Brosnan do their best and might have done ok if not for the musical demands.  Colin Firth's talents are frankly wasted.<br /><br />If you like ABBA, you're best off avoiding this movie so that you won't be haunted by the mental imagery when you listen to their music.
B001PPGAIA|5.0|I truly enjoyed the movie. Action, romance, strength, vision. And 2 very good performances by Jackman and Kidman. Great pair, he looks like her husband in real life. Good looking on screen those two.
B001DSNF8C|5.0|While I all but lost interest in the Bond franchise, (it almost seemed like it died with the last Brosnan film) along comes Daniel Craig and re-ignites it completely. Since Casino Royale I have probably seen over half a dozen previous Bond films. While he is a completely different Bond, I find him suprisingly refreshing offering a more serious and compelling 007. The scenes in the film offer a gritter plot than the usual thrill ride which definitely keeps the viewers' interest. Plot points are short but necessary, not overdone at all and keep pace with the demands of today's audiences. The audiences of today require something a little more realistic and tough. Craig folllows in line with a tough act, since there has been 5 other Bonds. Casino Royale, I believe gave the franchise quite a bit of new life that was much needed. An interesting thought occured to me after I watched it,  and that is, what if years ago Michael Caine was picked as Bond and not Sean Connery how would the franchise have looked then and today?
B0012SCHZK|1.0|[...] Talk about a waste of two plus hours.  The animation was good and that's the only positive thing I can say about this boring excuse for a historical action movie.  Let me just say this, if you saw any of the trailers you've seen all of the good parts.  Don't waste your time.
B000002UAC|2.0|I has this album in the sixties, This CD one had a different mix :(
031606792X|4.0|Breaking Dawn is the most enterntaining of the Twilight series.  It deals with real feelings, and real life issues that everyone can relate to, but it is funny at the same time.  It still does not compare to Isabel Allende's work, but it serves its main purpose, to enterntain.
B00127RAJY|1.0|I wish I could have rated this NO STARS!!!    I ordered this product on 2/27/2009. I am getting married on 5/16/2009 and wanted to use this as a way of losing weight & toning up for my big day. Well...it's March 30th and I have yet to receive the DVD. I am very disappointed. I have ordered other products off of Amazon and have never been disappointed. There is usually quick delivery & reasonable prices...     I wish that there was some sort of action that Amazon could take regarding this seller.
0743496736|5.0|I think this book should be read by teachers, principals, students and parents to understand the seriousness of bullying in our public school systems. Given the current issue of school violence in our nation, you will walk away with a whole other understanding of what is really going on in the hearts of the victims. Poignant and immaculately written, this is the best book I've read all year. Hands down.<br />This book is a must read. It's not always easy, someitmes it's downright heart wrenching, but in the end you'll be glad you read it. I promise.
B000MR9D5E|5.0|I got my product very quickly. I was so surprised!! I would definitely buy from this seller again!
B001R4MEYS|5.0|It seems that every time I throw in a new Mastodon CD I keep telling myself that it can't be as good as the last one.  So far I have been wrong EVERY time.  I love the ferocity of Remission, and in a way I miss it, but Mastodon have been evolving into a really heavy progressive metal band with the release of every CD.  All the good bands evolve.  It would be boring if they didn't.  The vocal change on this CD surprised me, but it works with the music, and that is all that matters.  The music is still brutal, it is just done with more maturity now.  All my favorite bands keep evolving and reinventing themselves (Opeth, Tool, Clutch) and Mastodon is no different.<br /><br />I am probably not your average Mastodon fan.  I am 40 years old.  I have a 9 year old son and a 4 year old son.  I have no tattoos.  I just happen to be a huge music/metal fan.  I have a lot of trouble finding bands now that aren't just boring or rehashed sounding to me, but thank God I stumbled upon Mastodon.  I saw them open for Clutch at a small venue in Athens, Ga, and made my way to a CD store the next day to buy Remission.  I got to see them headline the same small club later, and they blew me away with how far their music had progressed.  I love this band and can't get enough.  They are one of those bands that you don't end up listening to 1 CD over and over while rarely playing others.  Every CD has it's own distinct feel and sound and they are all great and worthy of repeated listens.  I have occasionally seen Brann (Opeth and Megadeth) and Bill (Megadeth with his kids) at shows, but have never gotten up the nerve to go speak.  After listening to Crack the Skye, I am going to have to go say thank you next time I see them.<br /><br />I am sure there will be some that don't like the vocal change, but this CD is so good, I think you will change your mind if you give it a chance.<br /><br />THANK YOU MASTODON FOR ANOTHER GREAT CD WHEN THERE IS SO MUCH JUNK OUT THERE RIGHT NOW.
B0013FNC38|5.0|Just love this CD.  I'm a new fan and am quite happy with the entire thing.
B001R4MEYS|5.0|I am a huge Mastodon fan and to say I was anxious for the release of this album is a bit of an understatement.  I honestly can't remember the last time I was anticipating a release this much.  That being said, \\"Crack the Skye\\" had a lot to live up to in my eyes.       Upon the first few notes of \\"Oblivion\\" I knew I would not be dissapointed.  I listened to the entire album in amazement.  It was love at first listen.  To me the album reaches its finest point with the last track, \\"The Last Baron\\".  At over 13 minutes this track takes us everywhere in the Mastodon sound and beyond.  They have definately opened up their minds to new sounds and styles and I think it suits them perfectly.  I've read a lot of critisism over the \\"clean\\" vocals on the album as opposed to the older vocal styles.  I think it's a great step forward for them.  They still use the scream-style vocals at times but chose to put more of a melodic sound into the mixture.  I love the vocal harmonies!  I wonder how they are going to pull it off live:) This is by far one of my favorite Mastodon releases to date.       As far as the DVD goes I think it is a great insight into the making of the album.  Great interviews, cool studio footage.  I was hoping they were going to release a DVD with this album as they did with \\"Blood Mountain\\".  For anyone that has seen that DVD this one is very similar.  It's definately worth the extra couple of bucks.  I know I'll be watching it quite a few times.     Mastodon has never been afraid to take chances and have surely taken some risks with this album.  While they may lose some fans who say it is too commercial, they will gain many more who can appreciate the depth of this incredible CD.  Do yourself a favor and give it a listen.

B001LPWGE6|5.0|I thought all three movies where of good quality and sound. I dont know why other people are talking bad about it. Even the price was really good.
0525950079|3.0|I thought Pillars of the Earth was amazing.  However, this book was just okay.  It was simply a rehash of the same characters and general plot lines of Pillars.  The constant gratituous sex scenes were ridiculous, as were the one dimensional evil characters.  It seemed to be thrown together with no editing - appearing to be written simply for fast cash so Follet could buy a new yacht or lake house.  It reminded me of a John Grisham novel - a simple page turner that rehashes the same story/plot lines of previous novels.  But like a Grisham novel, it is an entertaining, trashy read.  Just don't expect to grow from reading it - except for the occasional SAT word thrown in for effect.

B00005QZ7U|1.0|I purchased this for my 15 year old daughter who loved it. I did not watch the entire thing so my view is biased on superficial impressions of what little I did see. I don't care for musicals (usually), and I'm not a fan of Nicole Kidman so I had NO interest in this.
B001FSDOZO|3.0|This CD has a few good songs on it, but overall, it's not as good as their earlier work.  However, it is a keeper if your a Nickelback fan as the songs that are good are well worth buying it for.

B000007491|5.0|This is by far my favorite of all Supertramp albums!!  Unpolished and raw with great jams!  Not overly commercial like some of their later albums.  Highly recommended to those who like good progressive rock from the early years.
0439023483|5.0|This is a young adult, quick-read with themes that are reminicent of \\"1984\\", and the short stories \\"The Lottery\\" and \\"The Most Dangerous Game\\".  It's vividly disturbing,  but eye-opening.  I certainly hope that the next book explains how this society came to be!  I couldn't stop thinking about this story for weeks.
B001NY42KQ|5.0|My kids love this movie!  They love it b/c it's fun and entertaining:  the singing is great and the dances are terrific.  I don't mind them watching it b/c it's non violent and inoffensive.  A fun movie for the whole family.
0792838068|5.0|This film is a good anecdote for the jaded masses who diet on typical hollywood fare.  An original, brilliant, beautiful, and visceral film that will push your buttons like few others can.  Even though it ultimately portrays alcoholism as the dead end that it is (this story does not end happily), it is more complex than that, delving into those issues which concern us all: love, lonliness, despair, and hope.  In fact, the film is a roller coaster ride through all of these (much like real life) and by the end you will be drained and ambivalent.  Combined with incredible Jazz music, an original screenplay free of cliches, and unforgettable scenes, this is a movie you will not soon forget.  One of my top ten favourites and I have seen many thousands.
B001ILFUDC|5.0|There is no doubt, in my opinion, Pinocchio is still the best of all of the Disney films. It is ageless. From 3 to 93, people still love this fable with a moral story. Thanks Disney for releasing it. My grandkids 6, 5 and almost 3 loved it as did their parents and me too.
B001PU8N0I|1.0|I thought I'd see if this BBC production was worth watching, I found that it was not. Unlike David Copperfield, Dombey and Son and Martin Chuzzlewit where the speech and accents are understandable, here too many of the actors cannot be easily understood. The only two at the start (I gave up shortly into the first episode) whose speech was clear were the old seamstress and Little Dorrit's father. Little Dorrit was hopeless: her faint, under her breath delivery in a chip choppy English accent meant only about 45% of what she said was easy to follow. I could not imagine watching much more of a production in which the principal character could not be easily understood. I am not an American who is not attuned to British speech. I have two degrees from Cambridge University and have spent several years in the UK. But extreme British accents are not intelligible to most Americans and this production, unlike the others I mentioned, is full of them. I'd skip this version unless it can be had with subtitles (in English).

1577314808|2.0|I am reading the Power of Now in a book discussion class that I am attending at my church.  The majority of the members are not impressed with this book.  This is not a good book for people who have been truth seeker for years and feel that they are making progress.  It is a good book for people who are stuck spinning their wheels in negative memories of the past or are too fearful to move forward in the future.  Eckhart Tolle gives the impression that he has found enlightenment and anyone that disagrees with him has not.  You can feel his ego throughout the book.

Unfortunately 1990 and the release of \\"No Prayer...\\" marked the end of their golden era.  This is just an uninspired album which is really shocking considering how complex Maidens music was prior to this.  Gone are the epic progressive tracks with the exception of the subpar \\"Mother Russia\\".  There are a few bright spots like \\"Tailgunner\\" which is a great track as well as \\"Hooks in You\\" which really rocks but after that there's not much.  \\"Holy Smoke\\" is so below Maiden's standard that I don't know whether to laugh or cry. And why are they naming a song \\"Public ENEMA #1\\"?  Not what you would expect from Maiden. Sounds like a song title for a joke band like Blink 182 or Papa Roach. No doubt there was turmoil within the band as evidenced by Adrian Smith's departure after \\"SSOASS\\" and Bruce Dickinson's solo album released earlier in 1990, which is very good by the way, and his eventual departure from the band a couple of years later.  I can only guess that had something to do with this inferior release.  In other words listening to this CD for the first time was like watching Dan Marino's and Joe Montana's last seasons in the NFL; sad, because you knew the best days were gone for true legends.
B001N44BVQ|2.0|Roger Ferris (Leonardo DiCaprio) plays a supposedly tough, know-all CIA agent, searching in Jordan for the master-mind of several particularly grisly terrorist attacks.<br /><br />Ferris' idiot boss Ed Hoffman (Russell Crowe) spends most of his time glued to a cell phone ear piece, while watching his kids eat Cheerios or play sports. Against Hoffman's advice, Ferris turns to the Jordanian intelligence chief for help in nailing the terrorist culprit, and nearly gets himself killed in the process.<br /><br />Alas, David Ignatius has created one of the most ridiculous Middle East story lines I've ever seen. But director Ridley Scott also did an awful job. The entire film is unconvincing.
B000002UAU|5.0|Kevin Arnold (played by Fred Savage, narrated by the actor Daniel Stern) described his own generation (people born in the mid-to-late 1950s and early '60s), in his last \\"The Wonder Years\\" episode (1993): \\"...The first generation to grow up on Sgt. Pepper was heading out into the world...\\" (speaking of the summer of 1973).  Well, I have always wanted a copy of that album -- so that I could listen to it straight through, and get a better idea what the Kevin Arnold character was talking about.  And I am a member of that generation (born 1961)!  My favorite tracks were:<br /><br />#1 Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band<br />#2 With a Little Help from my Friends<br />#3 Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds<br /> .<br /> .<br /> .<br />#12 Sgt. Pepper's... (reprise)<br />#13 A Day in the Life<br /><br />Loosely translated, I loved it all -- from beginning to end!  For best results, play the entire CD straight through.  \\"We hope you will enjoy the show!\\"  o:-)
1416562605|4.0|The White Tiger by Aravind Adiga, uses the device of a long letter to a stranger over 7 days to tell the life story of a poor man in India who ends up a driver for a wealthy man.  In it Adiga reveals the struggles of those in the \\"darkness\\" (the poor) trying to serve those in the \\"light\\" and survive.  It's a clever way to tell a tale of modern India through the point of view of the driver.  This is not meant to be the only story of India, but like the film \\"Slumdog Millionaire\\" it's an eye opener.
B000002UDB|5.0|This entire album has a certain psychadelic feel to it!  My very favorite songs are: \\"The Fool on the Hill\\", \\"I am the Walrus\\", \\"Hello Goodbye\\", \\"Strawberry Fields Forever\\", and \\"All You Need is Love\\" -- tracks 2, 6, 7, 8, and 11, respectively.  They are all here, and they sound GREAT!  o:-)
0930289234|5.0|This novel is excellent read and character development is phenomenal.  All of the characters are 3 dimensional, for the number of characters and length of the book this is no short feet. Great illustrations and a rich story, worth reading even if you normally don't read graphic novels. Probably went in with too high expectations, but still certainly enjoyed the read.
0930289234|5.0|With so many positive reviews, there's nothing I can say that hasn't been said before me. I really enjoyed this graphic novel, and wish I had read it sooner.
1594201927|2.0|I enjoyed this book and became reacquainted with some fascinating financial history.  However, the author makes a few mistakes and is grossly biased against Republicans.      Firstly, he declares that the Argentine Austral declined by 140% (on pg. 112).  This is an impossibility as nothing can decline by more than 100%, unless it goes below zero (not possible for currencies).  (I traded currencies for years but middle school math is all you need to know this.)    More importantly he suggests that George Bush was responsible for the recent madness of mortgage lending to people who had bad credit and no ability to repay.  Bush tried repeatedly (on the record and in print) to reign in Fannie and Freddie (as did John McCain).  The author does not mention the role of Barney Frank and Chris Dodd in forcing banks to make bad mortgage loans to low income, bad credit borrowers.  He does not mention that Frank is on the record wanting to \\"roll the dice\\" with Fannie and Freddie, and declared that \\"there is no Federal guarantee behind Fannie and Freddie\\".  We are now $400 billion and counting into the bailout of Fannie and Freddie.  These are facts, not opinions, that escaped the focus of this book.    When discussing the S&L bailout of the early 1990s the author singles out John McCain as a prime culprit.  In fact McCain (whom I do not admire) was dragged into the Keating Five spotlight by the Democratic Congress, to make the scandal seem more bi-partisan.  McCain was tangentially involved and deserves criticism, but the spotlight should be focused on the corrupt diminutive Democratic Congressman from Rhode Island, who championed the legislation which led to disaster.  Fernand St. Germain is credited by all serious historians with corruption, taking public and secret money from the S&L industry, and authoring and passing the legislation that led to disaster.  (I actually discussed this with Paul Volcker many years ago. Democrat (and great Fed Chairman) Volcker did not disagreewith me.)    Read the book and enjoy it.  Nevertheless, it is not comprehensive, and certainly doesn't live up to the credentials of its author.  The subtle political bias is particularly galling.
B001PPGAIA|3.0|It is beautiful. The actor's are gorgeous. Looking at Kidman's and Jackman's beauty is an added addition to the movie. It is a much needed addition because it doesn't have much to say. The young boy is wonderful as is his grandfather. But the storyline is average. So three stars is all I could give it because although it had a good story-line it really didn't go anywhere with it. The ending was a delightful surprise. But it was light having a taste of ambrosia without really being able to enjoy.
B000FQJAIW|3.0|Not because it's not anamorphic or a copy of a crappy laser disc, don't buy Star Wars, a.k.a. the most overly hyped movie in recent history because it wasn't that good.  You're all kidding yourselves if you think watching it after 30+ years it'll get better.  To shell out anything over $10 for this particular movie, one you can watch for free on Spike, Science Fiction channel or Blockbuster, you all must be retarded.  By the way how many of you really understand what anamorphic means?  You people are worst than trekkies.  I mean they at least had a series plus a number of movies, one of which is coming out in a month, to fall back on.  A director that wasn't hated more than George Bush.  What have you got?  One, possibly two movies to talk about.  A movie where the closest the main character got to getting laid was with his sister!!  Yeah, that was revolutionary.  Get over the whole anamorphic-anoia, watch the movie on its own merits and you'll see even if it comes out in pristine condition, you'll still watch it once or twice unless you're the kid who had to see it 50 times.  By the way I liked Close Encounters of the Third Kind much more than this piece of crap.  No this isn't a troll, I'm just pissed that after 5 PAGES!!! all you could say was \\"Oh, it's not anamorphic! It's no better than the laser disc!! It's not the original!! You know everyone of you are going to go out and buy a blu-ray player when this turd hits the shelves, you'll watch it 6 times over the weekend and come back here and bitch that Lucas screwed you again!  I'd laugh at you too, $15!!  ha-ha-ha!  For the purposes of a review, it sucked.  Wonder why Mark Hamill didn't do more?  Watch this movie again.  Had Han Solo been the main character, it would be a different story.  Now take a drag or two on your inhaler before responding.<br /><br />P.S.  George Lucas blows.
B000AAJTL6|5.0|we already have the dvd and since we fly out during spring break's and holiday's. we decided to buy one for my psp. the kid's love watching them and myself, too. very entertaining!

I don't want to say anything to spoil what happening but I think I experienced almost every emotion reading this book. Definitely worth reading this trilogy!!
B001DJ7PR8|4.0|Even bad Woody Allen is better than almost anyone else's good stuff.  He is and has been our only truly world class auteur (ok, Scorsese too).  He is quite simply our Ingmar Bergman and as such deserves all the praise he gets and then some.From the low farce and Catskill schtick of Bananas and the Sex comedies through the darkness of Crimes, Hannah and Her Sisters and Manhatten, no one in American cinema has the range of Woody.While I liked Matchpoint I thought it finally a Woody gimmick piece not unlike Purple Rose of Cairo (which I really loved anyway) and Broadway Danny Rose.  But this latest piece Vicky Christina Barcelona was truly an exercise in modern existential loneliness and isolation.  It isn't so much about Henry James' lost Americans abroad as it is about how none of us can find the happiness we seek even when it is there for the taking.  Sartre says, &#34;Each man must undergo his own death&#34; and for all the laughs and romance VCB is finally about the aloneness that is the human condtion and even when we are surrounded by beautiful music and beautiful art we will finally go to the airport in search of the unhappiness we so richly deserve.Hats off Woody and folks rent or buy.....it's a better night than you'll get with the current Hollywood movies about 30 something men playing video games while thinking about the Swim Suit issue.  An adult movie for adults.  Now that's a concept.
B0009RCPY8|5.0|This was in great shape and less than if I bought it at Best Buy.  I loved the Ghostbuster movies.  I'm glad I can now replace my old VHS tape with the DVD of the movies.
B001E95ZHY|4.0|When I sat down to watch this film I was expecting a pretty low brow comedy, but I found this film very entertaining and interesting. I thought Rainn Wilson was going to do a bad Will Ferrell or Jack Black impersonation, but he delivers an original and heartwarming performance.<br /><br />The story is simple, but the laughs and catchy tunes will keep you tuned in through out this very engaging film. The cast is very good and the laughs and sentiments never feel forced. It's one of the best rock band comedies I've ever seen. not the best, but very good.
B000093FLA|4.0|It's quintessential Guy Ritchie. A plot that has so many sub-plots you almost loose track but somehow it all holds together and works. The English accents can be hard to understand and the Gypsy accents are impossible. But it just adds to the hilarious mayhem of the plot (Ritchie's specialty). Good story. The entire cast is terrific and Brad Pitt is at his best in this kind of character acting. Good directing. I don't ask for any more than that in an escapist flick. This is a good one.
B001R4MEYI|5.0|In my opinion evan the vocals sound like Ozzy (Sabbath era Vol.4) to me    This is A Monster Truely Original,Masterful, True Psychedelic Soundscapes  Amazing   A TEA PARTY ESSENTIAL   Can't wait
B00180R06I|5.0|I'm not going to add a lot to the already informative reviews that explain why this is simply put, one of the most important horror films of all time, other than to express my delight that such a well-done treatment of it has been released by Criterion.<br /><br />I have never seen VAMPYR look or sound this good on any other medium, and given that there are only a couple of damaged 35mm prints that have survived, what has been achieved here is remarkable. VAMPYR will never look like it was shot yesterday, but at least we are now given a complete glimpse of Dreyer's genius that's not heavily cropped and a half-dozen generations away from the original film elements. I might also add that Criterion's newly translated subtitles are more complete, accurate, and a godsend to those who love this film.<br /><br />I hope others will give this admittedly challenging film a try. Though you may find yourself a bit ungrounded the first time through, this is a film that gets more compelling with each subsequent viewing, and this edition is the best way to experience VAMPYR again and again.

B001M5UDGS|3.0|In all honesty, I fell asleep during part of this show, which might tell you something about how easy it was to pay attention to it; maybe it was me, but I'm thinking it was this show.  The acting was good, Nathon Fillion was PERFECT in his role, and the entire movie (songs included) overall was made well... hence the three star rating... However, I had a hard time finding a reason to stay awake during this show, it just wasn't interesting.  So, for a bit of a hoot, it was good, but for something really entertaining... meh.... Maybe this was better as an Internet show, perhaps it loses something in the transfer to DVD?  Before I fell asleep I had to explain everything to my husband who wasn't \\"in\\" on the know of what this show was all about.  I still have to explain to people that no, it isn't a blog, it's a parody of a guy with a blog, with music, and a terribly ill-fated \\"evil\\" doctor (who really is evil here, anyway?).  It's good for a laugh, but not much else.  Sorry Joss....

B00005JMYI|4.0|Ron Burgundy (Will Ferrell) is a man among men. He's got it all. Good looks, smooth moves, great suits, and the best job in the world as the number one lead Anchorman in San Diego. He even has his own entourage that consists of his fellow newsmen. Brian Fantana (Paul Rudd) is the on-scene reporter, as well as a self-proclaimed ladies man. Champ Kind (David Koechner) is the sports analyst and almost a `much too close' friend of Ron's. Then there is Brick Tamland (Steve Carell) who is the weatherman and, well, lets just say `not so smart' guy of the group. They are kings of the news in San Diego, until a Veronica Cornerstone (Christina Applegate) shows up. As Veronica is trying to work her way into the camera lens, the boys are trying to keep her out. They are doing quite well, until one day when Ron has a freak accident, which lets Veronica have center stage.<br /><br />The first time I saw this was with two of my best friends when I was driving through Texas and stopped for a few days of having fun in San Antonio. For most of the first half of the movie, I was barely laughing, and almost not enjoying the movie. And then about 35% to 50% into the movie, it clicked. I started to get the humor. And then the movie became hysterical. I was in tears on some parts. Now after the DVD came out, I even loved the movie more. From beginning to end, I find the whole movie hilarious. I honestly can understand why some might really hate this movie. The jokes can be very dumb at times. But once you find the humor in how the jokes are delivered, it becomes golden. The things I find myself laughing at the most are how the lines are delivered, or how some of the words are annunciated. The over the top acting also helps out a lot. It's just VERY silly. The improv lines are great also. When Ron and Veronica are smiling on camera and talking, the sound is muted for the audience in the movie while the credits role, but we as the viewers get to hear them hate on each other such as Ron saying \\"I'm going to hit you right in the baby maker, yep, right in the ovaries\\". The movie has a slew of cameos from some very funny actors as well. Jack Black, Vince Vaughn, Ben Stiller, Luke Wilson, and even Seth Rogen (not a funny part at all really, but it's funny seeing him just be a plain old camera man with like 2 lines).<br /><br />In the end, if you love this kind of silly comedy, then definitely own this. It never gets old.<br /><br />P.S. - I own the double disk feature, and have yet to watch \\"the adventures of Ron Burgundy continue\\" feature yet. It's supposedly a ton of extra stuff they cut out from the movie. Enough to make a completely different movie. I fast forwarded through it enough to see there is like a bank heist and everything. So I'll give it a look-see sometime soon once I get the urge to watch some more Ron Burgundy. Then I'll just update my review with its review.ng \\"I'm going to hit you right in the baby maker, yep, right in the ovaries\\". The movie has a slew of cameos from some very funny actors as well.

B000B8QEYC|5.0|It has been quite some time since Enya released her previous album, not counting singles and movie tracks. Get this CD. Enya is not going to change her style, which you wouldn't expect of ANY artist, and that's what I like about her. Her voice continues to sound excellent, and the non-vocal tracks are just as pleasant.  Aside from the cover song, \\"It's In the Rain\\", \\"Someone Said Goodbye\\", and \\"Amid The Falling Snow\\" are my favorite. As I write this review, I wish I had that CD in my hand to play right now!

I didn't lose weight since I don't have much to lose anyways but I lost 1 pant size so I'm happy:)  This workout is tough and really hard on the back and knees especially on level 2 and 3.   I still give it a 5 star for it being effective on toning the body:)
0930289234|5.0|While the most of the content concerns morbid ideas of man's fatalistic nature, set upon destruction, this comic/novel amazingly creates heroes who are easy to appreciate and loathe almost at the same time. This is the ultimate antihero comic. The vocabularly is definitely dictionary requiring. Wonderful, gripping page turner. Buy it before you see the movie.

B001DJ7PR8|3.0|I found Vicky Christina Barcelona an entertaining movie with great acting but a very predictable Woody Allen film. If you like Woody Allen movies, which I do, you are more likely to enjoy the movie. It was described to me as a comedy but I actually found it rather sad. It is worth seeing but not outstanding.

B001R7IHA0|4.0|If there is one thing I can say about KU, it's that he is consistent.  His releases are full of energy, insightful lyrics, great guitar riffs and heart.  \\"Thank You\\" is going to get a lot of play at weddings...sort of KU's \\"Lost in the Moment\\" by Big & Rich.  I was surprised by the drum loops used in some of the songs...I guess Chris McHugh needed a rest from all of the work the past year (KU, Little Big Town)...LOL.  KU speaks highly of Radney Foster often, so it's nice to see \\"I'm In,\\" a crowd favorite of Radney's fans, covered.    There are a huge number of commercial hits on this release so, no doubt, this will be a huge success.  His shows are fantastic (I saw him in Los Angeles on the VIP tour Friday night at the HOB) - he's deserving of \\"Entertainer of the Year\\" given 140 nights a year at two to 2-1/2 hours a night.  If you haven't seen him - you must.  Enjoy!
B001LRJH0U|2.0|This was a big disappointment. The characters actions in this film border on idiotic. Ed Harris is supposed to be a tough gun-for-hire who has only been with prostitutes and a squaw, yet he ends up buying a house for Renee Z within hours of meeting her? Mrs. Zellwegger seems to have had a frightening amount of plastic surgery for any role, let alone a western. Viggo is the most likable character, but he is also dragged down by the horrific script. There were some good lines, hinting that maybe the book was far better.  I like westerns and I almost turned this off several times.  And why is there a picture of a marlin fighting on a big game rig on the wall of the sheriffs' office in 1800's New Mexico?
B000K4X5XA|4.0|I was lucky enough to have seen Superman in the theatres when I was a child back in the 70s, and the sense of wonder it evoked in me then is renewed every time I watch it as an adult. Its epic grandeur, its sense of gravitas, has never been equaled by any other superhero movie (I mean, Marlon Brando, Glenn Ford, Trevor Howard, Gene Hackman, Mario Puzo, all screen legends of the time for a film based on comics? What were they thinking!). Christopher Reeve is the quintessential Superman, incredibly handsome, incredibly wholesome and good-natured, and his heroism on screen is all the more poignant in the light of what happened to him in real life. I still think that the CAN YOU READ MY MIND night-flying sequence is among the most romantic scenes in all cinema. This blu-ray version is beautiful. If you're looking for the sharpness of IRONMAN or BATMAN BEGINS on blu-ray, you will be disappointed. Much of the film is shot in a soft-glow style, and this look has been preserved in the blu-ray transfer. The Krypton sequences seem to take place behind a veil of haze, which might be frustrating for those of us used to the crystal-clear images of hi-def. But the Smallville sequences are  beautifully awash in golden sunlight and lush colours and the sharp outlines of prairie houses. They could have made the whole film sharper and clearer in the transfer, but this would have altered the sweeping, romantic, film-like feel of the cinematography. What you get here is better colour saturation. It's a pity that the studio did not offer the latest Dolby True-HD or DTS-HD Master Audio sound format; but the Dolby 5.1 sound here  still soars (John William's magnificent score is itself worth the price of admission). Compared to the earlier DVD edition, the channel separation in this blu-ray is more pronounced; towards the end when Jor-El warns Superman against tampering with history, check out how impressively his disembodied voice scans across all 5 speakers.  If you never had the chance to catch Superman in the theatres--or if you simply want to relive that experience-- the next best thing is to get this blu-ray and watch it in a darkened room at home on a large projector screen with surround speakers. (5 stars for movie, 4 stars for the blu-ray).to catch Superman in the theatres--or if you simply want to relive that experience-- the next best thing is to get this blu-ray and watch it in a darkened room at home on a large projector screen with surround speakers.

B000063147|5.0|Metal is not really doing well these days. Critics are only giving crap like Disturbed and Korn 5 stars, nu-metal crap is being released and ADD kids are only listening to what MTV and VH1 spoonfeeds them. However, we still have our beloved Underground and Non-Mainstream metal bands. And Avenged Sevenfold are exactly one of those bands.<br /><br />It's funny how bands like Linkin Park and Korn get the \\"Metal\\" label nowadays. We have critics going \\"OH, New Heavy metal! Oh, POLITICALLY CORRECT heavy metal! Oh yeah, that's funky dude.\\" Well in the words of Bruce Dickinson, \\"There's heavy metal, and then there's BULLS--T!!!!!\\". I couldn't agree more.<br /><br />Avenged Sevenfold are a band hailing from Huntington Beach. They have a bit of Metallica, Iron Maiden, Sepultura, Pantera, and many other great metal bands in their blood. We have M. Shadows with the gnarly vocals, Synester Gates and Zacky Vengeance with the shredding guitar riffs and solos, Johnny Christ on the bass, and The Rev pounding the living hell out of those drums. What confuses me is how people apply the \\"Emo\\" stereotype to A7X. How are these guys emo?<br /><br />These guys are modern day classic metal, and their solid debut \\"Sounding The Seventh Trumpet\\" is solid proof of that. This is the band when they were penniless punks with a record deal. It's them making it big before they made it big.<br /><br />The album begins with the intro \\"To End The Rapture\\", which fades into a metal assault. Then we get into \\"Turn the Other Way\\", an amazing way to begin an album. We have several other great songs like The Art of Subconscious Illusion, and We Come Out At Night. The best song is the fast and punkish \\"Streets\\", which got me hooked. Warmness on the Soul is a great track, and every other song on here, except for Lips of Deceit, is great.<br /><br />So overall, this is a great album, and an essential for every metal fan.

B001P9KR8U|5.0|Yes this movie is amazing, but this DVD sucks. I think we got jipped or something because the DVD obviously has a ton of special features it says so on the back of the case but for some reason it's not on the DVD. I'm really really mad I love the movie but I was really looking forward to the special features -- I think amazon should give us refunds or let us send back this dvd for the one with special features.      It was all a mistake and they sent me the special features version right away. Problem Solved.
B0000AOV85|5.0|Having been a long-time DSOM fanatic and having been often-ripped-off by \\"rockumentaries\\", I was more than pleased with this DVD. It breaks down DSOM song by song, with Floyd members playing the songs solo acoustic, singing solo, 30 years after the fact. They comment on how the songs were crafted, what they had in mind, etc. Excellent feature is Alan Parsons, who engineered the album, commenting as he plays isolated audio tracks, for example, David Gilmour's vocals from \\"Us and Them\\" minus the echoes. Many of the background snippets of dialogue are heard more clearly than ever, minus the music,and you finally see some of the people who provided these bits.  All in all, a great program that never lags. A must-have for any DSOM fan!

1594481717|2.0|William Blake wrote \\"London,\\" his blistering, loud poem vehemently denouncing the Age of Reason, before the end of the 18th century.  Shortly prior to Blake's poem, Immanuel Kant delivered his daunting philosophical treatise \\"Critique of Pure Reason,\\" but it was Blake who blamed all of the ills of civilization--from  oppressive laws, military institutions, and patriarchal church dogma--on his culture's replacement of the Imagination by the \\"mind-forged manacles\\" of Reason and Logic.  In the 19th century the Romantic Age followed these texts with many more privileging the imaginative faculty above all else--by Wordsworth, Coleridge, Shelley, Keats, Byron--all mapping the inner cosmos of inspiration and creativity that had been overlooked by the 17th-18th century Age of Enlightenment.<br /><br />You won't find the foregoing history of ideas in \\"A Whole New Mind\\": the author declares that everything prior to the 20th century was the \\"Agricultural Age\\" while most of the 20th century was the \\"Industrial Age,\\" followed by the \\"Information Age\\" from which we are now emerging into the \\"Conceptual Age\\" (the period when the \\"right brain\\" will finally receive its due).<br /><br />This is welterweight reading, and the author is so loose and careless (if not carefree) with his terminology that the book becomes an argument not on behalf of but against anything resembling a thesis about the importance of \\"right-brained\\" thinkers, creators, and personality types: the book could clearly profit from what the author speaks of disparagingly as \\"left-brained,\\" or \\"analytic\\" thinking.  The argument is without intellectual rigor, consistent or precise definitions, insights or useful information.  It's a feel-good, quick read that tells the reader what he wants to hear--be your intuitive, creative, imaginative self, secure in the knowledge that you're needed (to figure out the economy?).<br /><br />The absurdities are too numerous to mention.  For example, right-brain thinking is associated both with \\"simultaneous\\" thinking and with \\"telling stories\\" and \\"listening to music.\\"  In other words, the author doesn't understand the distinction between \\"spatialized\\" arts such as painting and photography and \\"temporal\\" (i.e. sequential rather than simultaneous) arts like narrative and music.  \\"Be a poet,\\" he says, without showing the least bit of evidence that he understands the sequential, developmental nature of, say, a Shakespearean sonnet.  And don't tell this author that it's foolhardy to prove a negative: he uses Al Gore's defeat in the 2002 presidential election as proof of the superiority of the right brain because clearly the Florida ballots with the confusing boxes and chads had to have been constructed by someone with a right-brain deficiency!  Finally, the author declares that right-brained thinkers are distinguished by (drum-roll) their interest in, and pursuit of, \\"Meaning\\" (it would be nice to see more evidence of it).<br /><br />If you need any more excuses not to waste your time on a book that belabors the obvious (and not very well), I finished the book on a flight from Houston to Detroit.  When I got off the plane, I saw advertising signs in the airport that were inarguably of the same persuasion, and of the same depth, as the author's insights: \\"Imagination rules!\\" \\"We're the leader in design!\\" (The author equates \\"design\\" with right brain thinking; \\"function\\" with left.)  And \\"Unleash your wild side!\\"  Obviously, the battle has been won.<br /><br />If you follow the author's instructions to suspend the critical faculty, those three slogans come close to representing as much as this book has to offer.  To his credit, the author does encourage readers to listen to a good symphony--no hints about how to do so--that would require some use of the critical faculty about which the author appears relatively clueless.  But how could you expect anything more from someone who attributes the discovery of velcro, clearly an example of inductive reasoning based upon empirical evidence, to a \\"metaphor\\"?  To put it plainly, you don't have to be a poet or a mathematician to cringe all the way through this book.<br /><br />Followed to its \\"illogical\\" conclusion, Americans can, in the near future, only expect to fall further behind the left-brained Asian upsurge in reason and logic that is threatening to make us a second-rate, dependent nation in the international arena.  Whereas formerly it was the mystic East that contemplated the Divine while we in the West followed the Puritanical work ethic directing us to build Fords and invent computers, the tables have been turned.  \\"Make a virtue of necessity,\\" the author seems to be saying, \\"Discover within yourself the soul of a poet.\\"<br /><br />The author's assurance that your employer will love you all the more would sound less hollow had we not already indulged our imaginative fantasies with the flower children of the 1960s.  Woodstock is done and near-forgotten.  Time to move on.  Shakespeare's language will not be understood by the reader who suspends grammatical logic any more than Beethoven's will make sense to someone who chooses to ignore sonata form.  The mind that Pink writes about is a perfect fit with the one that Madison Avenue pursues on a relentless, daily basis.ning based upon empirical evidence, to a \\"metaphor\\"?

0312370849|5.0|I found myself very easily engaged with this book - sometimes I feel it takes a lot to keep me interested but Tatiana de Rosnay had no trouble! The story begins with a young girl being arrested along with her parents in the early 1940s, in the midst of the WWII. The action is set in France, and the events described leave a reader with a sense of dread and confusion - after all, it seems that French officers are doing the bidding of the Nazis in rounding up all the Jews and later shipping them off to the camps. The twist, one that keeps reader's attention even more than the horror of terrible history coming to life, is that the girl locks her younger brother in the cupboard and takes the key along with her, not knowing she would not be able to return to free him. He is safe from persecution, but he is in danger of dying from hunger, fear, etc...<br />The fascinating story of what happens to the girl later, of her early growing up and becoming an unhappy adult, is interwoven with the present day story of an American-become-French woman who investigates the history of the Jewish round-up. Told from the first point of view, the horror this woman experiences when finding out about this part of history resonates with the reader's. Her character is well-rounded, so is that of her (slightly no-good) husband. The novel does a great job of keeping one in suspense, and sympathizing with all the characters - both from the past and present.<br />There are dark parts to histories of quite a few countries, some of which I discovered by accident. This book seems one of such accidents, both fascinating and horrifying in its account of real events (fictionalized though it may be). If you like this, I'd also highly recommend books by Robert Wilson, who writes amazingly well about Portugal and some dark parts of its history related to WWII.

0307450570|4.0|This book is a compilation that includes more than 200 craft projects from Martha Stewart Living. If you read the magazine, a lot of these projects will look familiar. As someone who isn't organized enough and does not have the space to keep all the back issues of the magazine, having all of these craft ideas in one place is extremely convenient.    The book is absolutely beautiful, loaded with page after page of full color photographs and detailed instruction. The quality of the paper, cover, and binding are high, and I wouldn't hesitate to showcase this book on my coffee table. This is also a lovely gift that can be given with confidence.    While there are so many great crafts included I do have a few favorites from the magazine that were left out, which is unfortunate. I'll be clipping these from the magazines and storing them in or with the book. One omission I was particularly disappointed about was the lack of Christmas ornaments (with the exception of one - the Snowflake Ornament). Leaves me to wonder if they are planning another book devoted specifically to this topic - I hope so. There is no time of year I am more in the mood to craft. There also isn't much in the way of other holiday-specific crafts. But, alas, despite the omissions the book is chock full of fantastic ideas that will provide plenty of inspiration.    A wide range of difficulty levels is included, so that whether you are a novice crafter or veteran you are sure to find plenty of projects to suit your needs. Particularly helpful is an appendix of tools for crafting, showing full color photos and descriptions of every crafting tool you could need for the projects included in the book. Very helpful if you've never used something before and want to know what to look for. Also included are many useful templates.    The types of crafts included are:  Albums, Scrapbooks, and Memory Boxes  Beading  Block Printing  Botanical Pressing  Botanical Printing  Calligraphy  Candlemaking  Clay  DecoupageEtching Glass  Fabric Flowers  Gilding  Glittering  Jewelry Making  Marbleizing  Matting and Framing  Mosaics  Nature Crafts  Origami and Paper Folding  Painting China and Glass  Paper Cutting and Punching  Paper Flowers and Birds  Photo Crafts  Pom Pom Animals  Quilling  Rope Crafts  Rubber Stamping  Silkscreening  Soap Making  Tin Punching  Wirework  Wreaths    Had this book included holiday ornaments and other holiday-specific crafts I would have given it a 5 star rating. Everything else about the book is superb. Hopefully a companion book will be released devoted to holiday crafts. Still, I do not hesitate to recommend this book to anyone even remotely interested in crafting.

B000002H33|5.0|September 27, 1986 remains one of the bleakest days in metal history.  Metallica lost their bassist and creative driving force in Cliff Burton.  Though the band would continue to write some decent albums, they were never the same band without him.    After his death, the band put out ...And Justice For All which to date remains their exploration into progressive metal territories.  Though the album is highly regarded among both metal fans and music fans alike, many called the production into question and felt it took away from the powerful nature of those songs.  The band abandoned that sound after supporting the album and started to resemble a metal band again nearly 20 years after ...AJFA's release.      This album, on the other hand, is highly revered by most of their fans and has not only withstood the test of time but may have actually gained more popularity as time has rolled on.  I'll tell you I've owned two copies of this album and now have it committed to digital format, which rules.      I could go on and on about how great the record is but really, it's a classic metal album at this point so you either have heard it or you haven't.  If you're getting into metal and you haven't heard the record, then you owe it to yourself to get it.
045122499X|5.0|Ken Follett's World Without End is a sequel of sorts to his 1989 bestseller The Pillars of the Earth. Follett's earlier book was set in the mid-12th century and had to do with the construction of a cathedral in Kingsbridge, England. World Without End takes place in Kingsbridge also, but some two hundred years later. One of its principal characters is a descendant of the architect of the cathedral. But the connection between the two books is minimal, so that reading or remembering what happened in Pillars is not a prerequisite for enjoying this novel.<br /><br />If you've read other books by Ken Follett, you'll know what to expect in this one: a strong heroine who rebels (arguably anachronistically) against the limitations imposed on her sex, a noble proto-feminist male lead; their love and ambitions are thwarted by morally bankrupt bad guys until, after overcoming innumerable obstacles, they triumph over their adversaries. If that makes Follett's novels sound formulaic, I suppose they are. But the author packs some enormously entertaining writing on this familiar scaffolding. His books are invariably page turners. And his characters are fleshed out sufficiently so that we always know what motivates them and we understand the complexities of their competing interests.<br /><br />World Without End opens in 1327, when its main characters meet as children. Initially it's hard to keep the various personalities straight, but they soon become familiar. Merthin, at eleven, is the eldest, and heir to the talent that his cathedral-building forbear had possessed. Ralph, Merthin's brother, shows signs already at ten of the violence and sociopathy that would later come to the fore. Gwenda is the light-fingered daughter of a thief, and Caris the unconventional and intelligent daughter of a wool merchant. The book follows their lives for more than thirty years as they fight to improve their situations: Gwenda seeks to dig her family out of poverty; Ralph aspires to restore his family to the nobility; and Caris and Merthin devote themselves to saving Kingsbridge itself after various reverses--economic downturns, a bridge collapse, the devastating consequences of the plague. At every turn they are opposed--by scheming monks and self-important guild authorities and a uninterested or cruel nobility.<br /><br />I had some problems with the book. Thomas's dramatic appearance on the scene at the beginning of the book suggests that he will play a more important role in the story than he does. And the great secret he's been keeping, when it's finally revealed, is anticlimactic. Also, while most of the story takes place in Kingsbridge and in surrounding villages, Caris travels to France in one section of the book and gets caught up there in the ongoing hostilities between the French and English. This part of the book did not add much to the story and could have been excised from it, and I also found it implausible in parts. It has hard to believe, for example, that Caris--one in an army of thousands--always seems to be close enough to hear conversations between important leaders. Finally, the onset of the plague is too often signaled by dramatic brief sentences telling us that some character or other has sneezed.<br /><br />But these are minor complaints about a book that's more than 1000 pages long and held my interest to the very end. World Without End is another great read from Follett, one of my favorite authors. It's highly readable--happily lacking in the stilted dialogue found so often in historical fiction. Follett is able, too, to describe complex things--in this book often involving architectural details, which are so important to the story--in simple prose. Don't let the book's enormous length scare you off.<br /><br />-- Debra Hamelily to the nobility; and Caris and Merthin devote themselves to saving Kingsbridge itself after various reverses--economic downturns, a bridge collapse, the devastating consequences of the plague.

1400082773|4.0|In this thoughtful, candid memoir, a young Barack Obama contemplates the development of his identity as a black man in America. His journey is interesting not only because he would someday become America's first black president, but because Obama's story, in a sense, embodies the turbulent melting pot of the country he now leads. The son of a Kenyan father from the Luo tribe and a white mother from Kansas, with a childhood spent in Hawaii and Indonesia, Obama grew up between several worlds. In Dreams from My Father, he reflects on his struggle to reconcile these worlds and figure out where he belongs. Along the way, the figure of his mostly absent father looms in the distance; in young Obama's mind, he is at once a legend to live up to, a symbol of his heritage, and a mystery.<br /><br />As a child and a young man, Obama faces the isolation of growing up in a white family and mostly white community where there are few people he feels he can relate to. At the same time, he searches for authenticity as he tries to figure out where he fits into the black community. Eventually, this desire for authenticity mingles with his idealism and leads him to Chicago, where he becomes a community organizer. Although he is able to have a positive impact, the work is fraught with challenges and frustrations, and the desire to belong--not to be seen as an outsider--seems to remain a common thread despite the acceptance he finds there. In the last section of the book, Obama travels to Kenya, where he movingly encounters his extended African family and comes face to face with the place that has filled his dreams since he was a boy.<br /><br />This memoir gives interesting insight into both who Obama is and the complexity of America's racial dynamics. While the book is a very worthy read, I had one major frustration with it: the book was either very poorly edited, or its author was in far too much of a hurry when he wrote it! After reading some of the grammatical errors in there, I was almost tempted to write Obama an angry letter. Take, for example, this passage: \\"A healthy, dose of guilt never hurt anybody.\\" There were also several places where there was a capital letter that should not have been there or a lowercase letter at the beginning of a sentence. As long as I was able to suppress my fury about this, however, I found the book very enjoyable.to write Obama an angry letter.

B001GKYBXA|2.0|Having been a bit of a Beatles nut in my youth (no pun intended) I was interested to see whether that sound had survived in any form or through any of the surviving members. Always wary of hyperbole, I thought I should judge it myself rather than rely on other reviews. So, I purchased this fairly cheap album and played it 3 or 4 times all through to allow for &#34;grow&#34; time. Here is my verdict:<br /><br />Track 1 (Nothing too much just out of sight): A curious start to an album which has some echoes of &#34;Wild Honey Pie&#34;. It features some heavy riffs with a kind of garbled, crazed vocal rant. Rating: POOR to FAIR.<br /><br />Track 2 (Two Magpies): Neat accoustic melody that does capture something of a (later) Beatles feel, though with a faltering and wavering voice and it needs more development to be a fully-rounded tune. Incidentally, one meaning of &#34;magpie&#34; is thief. Rating: FAIR.<br /><br />Track 3 (Sing the Changes): Bland, repetitive anthem with no middle section. Rating: POOR.<br /><br />Track 4 (Travelling Light): Folksy ballad, also with no middle section, then segues into another tune that is so plodding it sounds a bit like riga mortis setting in. Rating: POOR to FAIR.<br /><br />Track 5 (Highway): Could be based on any of a hundred rock riffs from late 60s, early 70s, but it could also be original, I just don't know. Rating: FAIR.<br /><br />Track 6 (Light from your Lighthouse): Is this skiffle or jugband music? A toe-tapper that doesn't sound all that original but is eminently singalongable (if there is such a word). Rating: FAIR.<br /><br />Track 7 (Sun is Shining). Sort of uninspired light rock with vacuous lyrics. Example- &#34;Every day, I get up. I look out the window. I get up...I get up...[etc]&#34;. Where is the soul, the wit, the reflections on a long life?  Rating: POOR.<br /><br />Track 8 (Dance till we're High). Very reminiscent of a '60s pop riff that could have been penned by Phil Spector or Holland-Dozier-Holland. Rating: POOR.<br /><br />Track 9  Lifelong Passion). Another lyrically simple warble, which sounds like something that &#34;Echo and the Bunnymen&#34; might have done and the lead vocal even sounds like the Bunnymen lead vocalist. Rating: POOR.<br /><br />Track 10 (Is This Love). Someone plays a very nice woodwind on this one, which features electronica and a plaintive, chant-like vocal. Probably the best track on the album, although, to be really picky, it could have done with some variation. Rating: GOOD.<br /><br />Track 11 (Lovers in a Dream). Heavy drum beat and more electronica, with a melancholic vocal, similar in some ways to the previous track, but not as good. The background vocal harmony is reminiscent of the Pet Shop Boys and the heavy drum beat is very similar to the one used by the Alice Cooper group. Rating: FAIR.<br /><br />Track 12 (Universal here, Everlasting now). Has a nice piano piece at the beginning and at the end that is reminiscent of the early segment of Revolution 9. Between this there are sound effects, like barking dogs, birds and voices. Begins well and then segues into a less than inspiring, repetitious drumming beat and vocal wailing again. Sounds like a lament and could possibly be one. This has shades of Pink Floyd and Emerson, Lake and Palmer. Rating: FAIR.<br /><br />Track 13 (Don't Stop Running).  This final track incorporates a reprise of an earlier track, so it has some merit. However, it features a riff very similar to the one in the intro. to Neil Diamond's &#34;Holly Holy&#34;. There is nearly 3 minutes of silence over half way through followed by what sounds like a coded message. A moody, electronic piece that is hard to judge due to the inexplicable gap in the middle. Rating: FAIR.<br /><br />I know he's nothing left to prove but this particular effort is below par, with only one track (number 10) that slightly inspired me and tracks 2 and 6 are quite interesting in a nostalgic kind of way. In addition, tracks 11, 12 and 13 havetheir moments. Something I will keep as a momento but not treasure. The disc will gather dust and never spin again. Most of it sounded like discarded out-takes to me, so the production value is close to zero. Compounding the problem is that the songs are sadly lacking in the use of relative minor keys, passing chords or inspired hooks: what we mostly get is songs with one or two notes or chords repeated over and over (I seem to recall the Beatles having a lot more texture in their songs). In regards the album presentation, I'm not sure what the kindergarten-type &#34;art&#34; was meant to signify or if there is an attempt at a coded message about 911 (the giant coil is interesting). On the other hand, it is good to lure the muse with playfulness: art should never be work, only play. However, this particular art doesn't quite work for me. &#34;Electric Arguments&#34; is well below average as a pop or rock album in any era. But had the songs been finished; had the production been sound; had the lyrics been more intelligent, it may have been a half-decent album - technically at least....and yet, there is no thrill of sound I can identify within this set: 'marking time' is the phrase I would use to describe this effort. It's as if the body had gone cold in the crypt.

I always wonder if Roxxaine became a Rider, but it would probably be bad for Johnny. I always wondered why Ghost Rider's fire turns blue in the presence of his loved ones. It probably means he's weak. I love the part when he first changes. My mom doesn't like that part. I love 2 different parts. The part where Ghost Rider rides off the rooftop and Carter Slade and Ghost Rider riding to San Venganza together. I think in 2010 there is a sequel being made where Veangeance comes, and Carter Slade returns. I recomend this movie but for now, Lets Ride.

Sigh.  I should just buy the Birkenstocks, white socks, and hippie skirt now.  Oh well, at least my insides will be healthier.<br /><br />By the way, Polyface Farms does deliver, not to individuals but to local pickup stops, every 5 weeks.  Boo-yah!  And their egg yolks really are creamier :)<br /><br />That's it - get this book.  Worth every second.
B001MYIXAW|5.0|The best movie in a long time. A different vision and way to tell a tale. The whole product it´s very strong and full of talent, from the directing, actors, music, locations, And the story itself it´s fantastic. Don´t you leave this movie, perhaps in a short time nobady told you about it because is not from Hollywood. It´s just a masterpiece.
B0015OKWL2|1.0|This movie played a cheap trick on the audience, the whole plot is extremely dumb, and donnie wahlberg come on? 50 cent? give me a break?  This movie is totally lacking,the only thing that kept me from hating it and continue to watch was the two powerhouse actors. other than that. your better off Watching Heat.
B001PMLKLK|4.0|It's great to hear that rockabilly is still alive and well..This is the debut album from Irish songstress Imelda May and I can say that the 'Gal Dun Good'. Each song is a throwback to the 50's, with not a filler in sight. You get the rockin' sound of the Gretsch guitar sitting over a Slappin' Double Bass, Brush sticks on the snare drum and irresistible piano tinklings making you just want to get up there and boogie. The first single and opening track 'Johnny's Got A Boom-Boom', sets the scene for a scorcher of an album. Subtlty comes in the form of 'Knock 123' and the divine 'Fallin' in Love Again'. A definite must buy. I stumbled across her on You Tube and boy was I glad that I did. If you like Brian Setzer or 50's/60's rock'n'roll, you will love this.
B000007VCM|5.0|It's hard to classify a tough, rocking set of songs like the ones contained in \\"Love.\\"  For me, it just simply rocks!  And according to Mark Knopfler's Sultans of Swing, they rock in a non-trumpet manner.  I wouldn't call it goth or psychedelic, although elements of both are present.  More than anything, I think that an awesome melodic flow, that is at the same time, punched up by raw energy and vigor in the way that the instruments are played and the way Ian sings, is the glue that binds and also what makes this collection of songs stand out among many, many contemporaries, and current outfits.  I believe after \\"Love\\" the Cult veered more towards a crunchier heavy metal sound (some of which I have in my collection).  If you don't have \\"Love\\" in YOUR collection, please, what the fek are you doing?  Get off your duff, stop twiddling already and get it.  I promise you, it's one of the all-time greatest set of recorded rock songs ever.

B001PU8N0I|5.0|I have already seen this production in its entirety as some friends in England forwarded it to me!!!      You will fall in love with Amy Dorritt(Claire Foy) because money, its possession and lack thereof, never changes her, she is kind and steady throughout !!    The rest of her family will change when they come into a lot of money except her kind uncle!!!                    Arthur Clenham played by Matthew Mac Fayden is an exceptional gentleman more than worthy of Amy's love and admiration!!!      I will say no more other than watch it and stay with it, you will not be disappointed!!!   I am placing my pre-order now!!!

B000MNP2KI|5.0|Casino Royale is a Bond film that finally manages to pull of the \\"real\\" style correctly.  There have been admirable efforts such as On Her Majesty's Secret Service, and the Timothy Dalton films, but none have quite pulled it off right.  This is the 21st film in the \\"never-ending\\" franchise and also introduces us to our sixth actor to play Bond and the first to be based directly on Ian Fleming's initial novel, Casino Royale (excluding the 60s comedy film).<br /><br />Martin Campbell, who also directed one of my favorite 007 adventures in 1995, GoldenEye, returns to the director's chair to introduce us to yet another Bond-actor.  This is the most real James Bond to date and is very believable portrayal filled with some of the best camera work you'll ever witness.  It comes across as real, but it also keep to classic Bond roots by including cars, beautiful women, and even some more realistic gadgets, such as a tracking device inserted within his vein and a few others kept handy within the glove box of his Aston Martin.  He may not wield a laser wristwatch, but he gets the job done.<br /><br />The action sequences in this film are perhaps the most intense to be put into any Bond film and shall keep you on the edge of your seat, because this may be the one film where you actually feel like James Bond is in danger.  All previous films you knew that \\"Hey, this is James Bond.  He'll make it.\\"  This one you can still think that while watching, but you certainly worry more for the title character than you have in the previous entries.<br /><br />Daniel Craig does well as the title character, and is very believable as a young James Bond starting his career.  He walks as if he has a chip on his shoulder and you can tell this is the angriest Bond to date.  He has yet to transform into the coolheaded Bond seen in Connery, Moore, and Brosnan, and he shows it in every way.  This Bond hasn't even grown accustomed to wearing a suit!  But he is however a good gambler and enjoys himself some cocktails.<br /><br />Judi Dench returns as M, the head of MI6.  Dench who first took the role (being the first woman in the role) in the Brosnan film GoldenEye has always played a good character, but this time around she comes across as being a different type of M.  This time she seems more like a worried-parent character, who treats Bond as though he is a child, because she knows he is not the Bond of legend at this point, and he needs guidance or he shall never turn into the coolheaded super agent that we all know and love.<br /><br />This is one of the best entries in the James Bond franchise, there is no denying that, but I do worry of how the Craig run will end.  After Campbell left Brosnan he got pulled down by scripts that relied too heavily one gadgets and comic one-liners, and now I fear that Craig may end up being weighed down from becoming overly serious (see: Quantum of Solace).  We must remember that Bond is a basically a comic-book type hero who is basically a superhero who wears a suit instead of a costume.<br /><br />Regardless of whether or not Craig's run ends on a good or bad note Casino Royale shall easily remain one of the best James Bond films ever made.  Campbell should stop running off and stick to Bond, because it seems things start to go badly when he leaves his Bond actor in the hands of the sponsors.s.

B001IF252C|4.0|Bought a new product from an Apple Store on in late March, which was fresh inventory. So far, it has had no problems using a 2009 Mini (2GHz) and an NEC LCD3090 30 inch monitor at full resolution. No flickering, missing links, image corruption, even after hours of use. Even though this is an active component (converting DisplayPort packets into the datastream for DVI, including all the needed buffering), its still damn expensive and big for Apple products.

B000BW7QWW|5.0|I was never a fan of Firefly... I watched a bit of the first episode and found the entire idea of revolvers in space stupid, yet when this movie came out I found myself on the edge of the seat and enjoying the entire thing, the fight scenes were awesome, the space scenes were awesome, the crash scenes were awesome and the backstory felt very well flushed out.<br /><br />I now own serenity and the entire firefly series as I have become a convert, and this is one of those movies where I can no no longer understand why people don't like it, and why it was canceled. AWESOME AWESOME AWESOME Movie.
0807126071|5.0|Every now and again a book comes along - a rarity in its happening - that introduces you to a world of goofy characters and takes you through such absurb situations that you remember them forever.  \\"A Confederacy of Dunces\\" is such a book !  If you don't find this book both magnificently written and exceptionally funny then I truly recommend you admit up front (maybe secretly too) that you are just not into wit in its grandest form.  J.K. Toole left us a masterpiece, may he forever make the angels of heaven laugh as he did me and will do the majority of readers who are fortunate enough to experience this absolute gem.
B00005ONMP|2.0|I have mixed feelings in regards to Claudio Abbado. While I don't question his credentials, because he certainly has earned his place amongst other conductors, I do question the amount of research he has done on these pieces. Mendelssohn's \\"Scottish\\" and \\"Italian\\" symphonies merely sound like leftover Haydn and Mozart under him. That Romantic sweep that is heard in much of Mendelssohn's work, especially in these two symphonies, is gone. I think what Abbado doesn't understand is Mendelssohn is a Romantic composer and not a Classical period composer. \\"Hymn of Praise\\" and \\"Fingal's Cave,\\" two of my personal favorites, are also not played with real conviction or at least not the kind of conviction Karajan had.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I find these readings rather unsavory and lackluster. Abbado seems to just gloss over these works and fails to notice their idiosyncrasies. The London Symphony does an admirable job, but these interpretations are far from the majestic sweep of Karajan and Claus Peter Flor.<br /><br />I give these recordings 2-stars: 1-star for effort and the other for the playing of the LSO, but I would seriously check out other collections before fully committing to this one.

B000QCS9NM|5.0|This book starts off begging you not to read it....maybe you should listen. This book has a great story that you will not want to stop reading. However it is not the feel-good story of the year. The main character makes you look at yourself and you may not like what you see. I could not put this book down.
B001TODCII|4.0|The great thing about a movie like \\"Taken\\" is that it knows exactly what kind of movie it is.  There is no awkwardness, no \\"message,\\" no random and unfulfilling subplot--just a good set-up followed by a relentless pursuit.<br /><br />Liam Neeson plays ex-CIA agent Bryan Mills, a haggard retiree who lives alone and wants only to have a good relationship with his semi-estranged daughter.  Bryan's buddies needle him about a life with nothing to do, and convince him to protect a famous singer for a one-time job--which allows for the obligatory \\"you don't want to mess with this guy\\" scene early in the movie.  He then very reluctantly allows his daughter to go to Paris, where she is kidnapped by a high-end prostitution ring.<br /><br />That's the first act, and although it takes a little while to unfold, all the elements are necessary for an understanding of what happens later in the movie.  Once Bryan Mills is off and running, your eyes will never leave the screen.<br /><br />Neeson is perfectly cast here, using his athletic, intimidating physique (he was once a boxer) to great effect in many confrontations.  \\"Taken\\" is a white-knuckle pursuit, and both the chases around Europe and the fight scenes recall the James Bond and Jason Bourne movies, and the rather underrated \\"Ronin.\\"  In fact, it occurred to me while watching \\"Taken\\" that Neeson might have made a better Bond than Pierce Brosnan.  Neeson is a bit too old for it now, and Daniel Craig has shown himself more than capable as everyone's favorite spy.  But Neeson's brutal physicality, combined with his emotive physiognomy, makes Bryan Mills a character everyone roots for.<br /><br />If you're looking for complex character development, Bryan Mills is no Oskar Schindler--but that's hardly the point of \\"Taken.\\"  It's a quick and gratifying ninety-four minutes when you're looking for a well crafted, suspenseful thriller.
B000002UA5|5.0|I'm just going to get this out of the way right now: I think it's great.    This is for people who already know what kind of music they like so I'm not going to bore you with a bunch of details.    The studio disc might be a bit iffy for alot of people.  It belongs to in very specific niche.  If you like the experimental avant-garde stuff of the period you'll like it.  If you fast-forward through \\"Revolution 9\\" on the White Album you probably won't like it.  It gets a little bit arty even for my tastes.  But if you don't like it...    The live disc is why it's worth getting for anyone who likes early Floyd music.  Every one of the four extended tracks are better than their studio counterparts.  It's nice, thick psychedelia.  My favorite is the live version of \\"Astronomy Domine,\\" one of my favorite songs.  It was cool hearing it pulled off the shelf and dusted off on Pulse and on David Gilmour's Live in Gdansk but the version here is my favorite.    If you're in to psychedelic music, buy it.  You'll like it.    If you're a Pink Floyd fan but haven't really gotten into their early stuff yet, go for Piper at the Gates of Dawn and A Saucerful of Secrets first.  If you like those, you won't regret buying this.
B001HDYK6Y|5.0|If you are like me you are thinking of taking a gamble and buying this album with little to no real previous Keane vibes...Well what are you waiting for???  BUY IT...What an amazingly choice purchase you have stumbled across here! HOOZAH!!!  If you love music, you will love this album.  If you want a record you can put on and play all the way through, you will love this album.  If you want great music to live life and have fun with, you will love this album.  It is unfortunate that some people have been bashing this album as of late, just because it is such a radical departure from their hit debut smash record, Hopes and Fears.  Yes, we all know Hopes and Fears is an amazing. Just as the Iron Sea record has its finer moments, Perfect Symmetry succeeds on new horizons just as the groups previous releases have made it proper to unabashedly tread into fresh new musical meadows of lushness.  Here with PS they just as seamlessly enslave you aurally with their atmospheric and fresh and inspired songwriting paired with the high level of musicianship that is present is markedly comparable to other overseas mega acts such as Coldplay and surprisingly enough to both present day and the younger, more energetic early U2 and that is by far one ultimately buff compliment to this artist.  PS represents a more modernized, piano driven, synthesizer buzzing, vocally infused musical orgy that starts all up in your ear hole then it works its way into your soul and bones with the ease of a warm bath infused with the mindlessly soothing musical essences of these uber-talented gents from Battle, England.      THE HOT TRACKS - AGAIN & AGAIN, SPIRALLING   THE CHILL TRACKS - PERFECT SYMMETRY, PLAYING ALONG, YOU DON'T SEE ME    THE YOU CANT STOP LISTENING TO IT TRACK - SPIRALLING    5 OF 5.     BUY ME!
B001P3SA94|4.0|As blues musician, I have or think I have almost any and maybe all DVD's, rare DVD's and Vinyl of Delta and Chicago blues. I enjoy the back stories etc as much as the usual obligatory reading or viewing... with that said, I enjoyed this movie but what I really enjoyed was the performance of Howlin' Wolf. In one DVD I own, Howlin Wolf had a back and forth argument with Son House which by itself is amazing, but it really gives one the unadulterated Wolf when he is not performing and a bit angry and this is no urburn legend regarding Howlin\\" Wolf ..   I suggest this movie on this perfromance alone.. The remainder of the movie has its moments, some little bits that if you know about Muddy, you will pick up on the attention to detail. Sometimes you actually believe its Muddy your watching sometimes not. Willie Dixons is right on. Little Walter from what I have read was a spot on perfromance. Very cool to see them recording, its easy to imagine that it maybe was that way.  The movie bogs down in my opinion after Chuck Berry brings in \\"Rock and Roll\\" had a nice moment when Muddy went to England set up by the Stones. All together its worth the price especially since there really isn't much to compare it to. There's so much more they could have done if some of the sub plots were left out but to each there own. Hell if you got an extra 20 bux's and your a blues lover, get this movie, You'll swear Howlin' Wolf came back from the dead.

0670020478|5.0|When you are engaged in something you do well and really like you are in \\"the element\\", according to author Ken Robinson.  Being in the element is good because you will be mostly happy as you undertake the activity about which you are most passionate and most enjoy.  The problem with education today is that it is not at all geared to find the things that students most like and are most good at; instead, modern education seeks to meet whatever new curriculum standard is in vogue, particularly when those standards are nationalized into tests.  In addition, education tends to place subjects in a hierarchy, with those supporting the professions, like medicine and law, at the top.    Robinson gives ample examples of individuals who found their element outside of education - Paul McCartney and John Lennon of the Beatles, dancers, painters and others.  But Robinson is not making the case that it is just performance artists who find their element; there are also others like mathematicians and scientists.  The worst problem arises when individuals are guided towards professions for which they may have talent, but for which they have no real passion.  Robinson gives an example of an orthopedic surgeon who was miserable in her profession and transitioned into a shoe designer.  And then there are others who never escape from their un-elemental traps, likely living Thoruea's \\"lives of quiet desperation\\", earning a living but not really living fully.  For those individuals this book is a lamentation.  For current educators and parents, the book is a call to seek your children's calling, and help them find their element, so that they may live lives of satisfaction and fulfillment.

B001O4FXY4|5.0|I've been playing blues finger slide for too many years to admit, and I heard Derek Trucks a couple of years ago and instantly connected to his sound. I've heard him play with his wife the Almond Brothers and of course more recently Eric Clapton and he's always a joy for me to listen to. I have one of the DVDs and a couple of his and one of his wife's CDs that remain in my play list all the time.    As a 1960's - 1970's fan of Southern Blues/Rock Derek brings back some of the finest memories of that era and is inventing new ground of his own. This is one of my favorite CDs and recommend it to all of my friends, I'm glad to hear someone playing bottle neck the way this guy does back o the scene.

0141182865|4.0|I'm re-reading this novel for the second time. A Confederacy of Dunces reeks with irony, not in the least because the author, John Kennedy Toole, took his own life in part because of his inability to get the book published. The irony was that his mother persevered in showing his  manuscript and the book was published and won a Pulitzer Prize. The book really is extremely funny. Toole had a fabulous ear for dialogue; he perfectly captures the way people in New Orleans spoke in the early 1960s. At that time most of the people of Lousiana had a language that was unique. Here's an excellent argument against suicide-you honestly never know. Toole's suicide silenced his voice and denied us whatever other novels he might have produced. I'm grateful that we've got this one, but it's hard not to feel cheated. Anyway, anyone who's never read this book should grab it; it is a genuine classic. People will be reading this novel for a long time.
0143038095|5.0|I am guilty of seeing the movie before reading the book on this title.     However, it didn't take away from the story but there were small subtle differences between the two.

Great and easy read.

B001QWEE4E|5.0|I've done an A-B comparison of the Blu-Ray to the (dual layer) DVD - with \\"upscaling\\" to 1080i (the limit of our rear projection TV's resolution)- and on that level they're certainly very close in quality, but the Blu-Ray is still noticeably superior in both video and audio. The Blu-Ray audio is more dynamic and clear and allows minute details like readable small print on a can of beans, which is just a blur on the DVD.    There are 3 extra features on the Blu-Ray which are apparently on the \\"2 disc\\" DVD but aren't on the single DVD - and two of them are quite significant: \\"A Groundbreaking Success\\" (~16 minutes) looks at the film's many aspects of achieving bona-fide success (including financially), despite active homophobic opposition.     \\"Music From The Mountain\\" gives us a much greater appreciation of the soundtrack music and of how truly integral it is to the impact of the whole film. I've also been privileged to give a personal hug of appreciation to both Rufus Wainwright and Teddy Thompson at their Brisbane shows, so it's a real treat to see them here as an acknowledged element of what works so beautifully in this film.    I loved Annie Proulx's short story. I couldn't help being cought up in the full emotion of the interplay of these two men who are totally in love and who bravely find enough time and space in an aggressively hostile world to follow their bliss for as long as is humanly possible.     Ang Lee's \\"Brokeback Mountain\\" sets a standard of perfection in every aspect of the art. It is also one of the few films which not only enhances, but also in no way compromises the emotional impact or moral integrity of the source material.     Even if you already own the DVD, purchase of the Blu-Ray version is justified for anyone who truly appreciates the film, its historical significance, and its potential to continue do great good in the world as one of the all-time classic - and unapologetically gay - romances.

B0015YIGJC|5.0|As someone who had previously only heard of Mana, I bought this album on a few words of recommendation and a lot of curiosity. I can't compare this to any other Mana albums because I've never heard them, but I can say that from an outsider's point of view, this is an incredible album. I tend to shy away from live albums, but this has fantastic sound quality, and is very well performed. And in fact, some of my favorite moments are in tracks like Labios Compartidos and Vivir Sin Aire when the whole crowd sings along. The effect is downright euphoric. I also love the funkier riffs on Dejame Entrar and Donde Los Ninos Jugaran. This may not be the band's best work by any measure, but it is an excellent one nonetheless.

B0000AUHPG|4.0|This was a unique western, one in which sometimes the action moves excruciatingly slow, which can either be fascinating or boring.  Take your pick. I've watched this film several times over the years and found it both.  It's odd in that regard but I believe patience wins out here and is rewarded.    The movie is filled with gaps of silence while closeups of the main characters' faces are shown. That's director Sergio Leone's trademark, and I believe he does it more in this film than in any of his others. When you get closeups of chiseled faces like Henry Fonda's or Charles Bronson's, it quite interesting but most of the movie feels like slow motion. At 165 minutes, this movie takes a lot of patience.     At any rate, the action scenes are a decent and not bloody and the characters are quite real, meaning believable. I liked Fonda in here the most with his against-type villain role of \\"Frank,\\" which was excellent. I read where he said this was his favorite role. I'm glad to hear that. The best character in the film, though, was \\"Cheyenne,\\" played by Jason Robards.    The opening credits - spaced out over 11 minutes (which was rare in \\"classic movie\\" days) - are considered by many as the most famous ever, in any genre. The music in this film is different, too. It's not as memorable as the score from \\"The Good, The Bad And The Ugly,\\" however, done by the same composer, but it has its moments. Early in the film we see some shots of Monument Valley which are the prettiest I've ever seen. I wish there had been more of that.
B001BGTWXI|2.0|Let me start off by saying I am a rabid slipknot fan. I love the unique sound of the first album, the heaviness of Iowa, I love the creativity of The Subliminal verses. But this album just is sorry. This just sounds like radio nu-metal. There are a couple of redeeming tracks (All hope is gone, even snuff was beautiful) but overall, I can't even listen to this. What happened??? They lost it. I hope they can reach down between their legs and grab what is left of their balls and produce something reasonable if they even have a next effort. I would be more happy if they just made a album full of soft songs like snuff.... atleast they are good at those. This album is boring and insulting. Pop metal. Blasphemy. Sucks.

B000YAA68W|5.0|\\"Persepolis\\" is an animated film and was first released in 2007. It won the Jury Prize at that year's Cannes Film Festival and was also nominated at the Oscars for Best Animated Feature. It's based on Marjane Satrapi's graphic novel, and tells the story of Satrapi's own life.     \\"Persepolis\\" opens at Orly, one of the main Paris airports, with Marji preparing for her return to Tehran. The prospect of returning is weighing heavily on her and, as she tries to gather herself, she thinks back to her childhood - in the days leading up to the Iranian Revolution.     Marji was just an ordinary 10-year old in 1979. She loved eating French Fries with red sauce, idolized Bruce Lee and had only two dreams : to, one day, shave her legs and to be the last prophet. Naturally, she understood little of the \\"adult world\\" - Marji liked the Shah, and believed her teachers when they said he'd been appointed by God. Her parents soon put her straight : they, with good reason, detested the Shah. The current Shah inherited his position from his father - who, in turn, had been appointed by the British, rather than God. Furthermore, her Grandfather (a prince, no less) and her Uncle Anoosh had been imprisoned by one Shah or another and both had been devoted Communists - viewed by both Shahs as something evil. Wide-eyed and deeply impressed, Marji immediately switches sides and becomes a devout revolutionary...well, she adopts Che Guevara as a role model and chants anti-Shah slogans in the living -room. Her parents are careful to confine her when the uprising finally comes - something they're involved in themselves. With the fall of the Shah, life is - for a short spell - like a dream. Old family friends - like Siamak, who had been routinely tortured - and Marji's Uncle Anoosh are released from prison. Like Marji's parents, both are hopeful of a better society. Marji had known nothing of her Uncle before his release from prison but, before long, the pair are devoted to each other. Unfortunately, their hopes prove unfounded. Islamic Fundamentalists win the following elections, and society becomes even more oppressive. Many of the Shah's former enemies - including Anoosh - are hunted down and returned to prison; others, like Siamak, flee. However, Marji and her family stay put...with our young heroine becoming more and more disillusioned. In time, she turns her back on her dreams of being a prophet - instead, she starts listening to Iron Maiden, adds a denim jacket and trainers to her hijab and argues with her teacher when she lies about their wonderful new government. Naturally, her parents are a little concerned that she's speaking up like this...and feel they have to do something to protect her. The path they set her on eventually leads to the confused young woman sitting in Orly Airport.     An absolutely brilliant movie, one that is much more than \\"just a cartoon\\". The film was initially released in France, with Chiara Mastroianni (as Marjane) and Catherine Deneuve (as her mother) amongst the voice actors. Both reprised their roles for the English soundtrack, with Sean Penn and Iggy Pop amongst the \\"big names\\" coming in. There was something about the artwork that somehow grabbed and held my attention, much more so than the recent CGI masterpieces that have dominated in recent years. It's also inspired me to pick up the \\"Persepolis\\" the book - the first graphic novel I've picked up in years.
B000FZETKC|1.0|This came out of a Hollywood era when movies for teens were just beginning to be the rage. You can see there is still a very conservative 'Leave it to Beaverish' quality here, especially in the stiff acting by the parents. Also, it's filmed with a glow filter over the lens, giving a kind of hazyish quality, very weird. They only used to do that for aging female stars to hide the wrinkles. The 80s soundtrack is still wonderfully evocative, however.
B001NEK2GE|5.0|I bought this device to use primarily in World of Warcraft. If you're willing to take the time to set this up carefully and tweak settings, it will give you amazing results. I swear I increased my DPS just because I could get to all my skills so much faster.    My recommendation: Group skills logically, and put most use skills towards the middle (I call it the Dvorak style of gamepad configuration)    The build construction is very solid, the thumbstick feels very awkward at first, but after you get used to it feels very natural. Being able to save profiles on the device is a bonus, but I don't really see myself carrying this thing from computer to computer.    My only complaints really are the lack of a built-in modifier key (I would like the buttons to dynamically change if I am holding down a thumb key). I hear logitech is working on this, but I can't review what MAY be coming. Also the thumb buttons could be in a little bit more ergonomic spot, and next to each other. Also, the thumbstick is annoyingly hard to depress on my unit, so much so that I never use it (which is a shame, as it could be rather useful given my thumb is almost always resting on it).    All in all, I give an unapologetic and hearty recommendation. I love this thing now, and would find it hard to go back to a normal keyboard setup.
045122499X|1.0|I rarely give up on a book -- especially when it is loaned to me by a good friend who enjoyed it -- but by page 222, I had experienced enough.  The plot was repetitive with the same characters experiencing the same mistakes, beatings, betrayals, and plots over and over again, never learning from their own histories and, therefore, destined to repeat the same history over again.  Even the \\"exciting\\" parts were passive!  I really didn't think I could handle another 80% of the same so I moved on to something else.  I do not recommend this book unless you are looking for bedtime stories to put you to sleep.  Sorry Oprah.
B000G8NXZK|1.0|After buying and viewing Brazil upon the recommendation of a friend who usually makes good ones, I came away wondering why on earth Criterion saw fit to issue a three-disc set for a film that didn't deserve to be reissued in the first place! I know I am swimming against the tide here, but this is one of the stupidest films I have ever had the displeasure to watch.<br />Yeah, I know its a parody of life in an all-encompassing bureaucratic state where citizens chafe under the oppressive heel of The Ministry of Information. But there is no real oppression, only mind-boggling incompetence. The story (and the acting) is so jejune that I didn't know whether to sneer or puke. Brazil not even \\"funny\\" in a Three Stooges kind of way! Robert de Niro especially ought to be ashamed of having his name attached to this indulgent silliness.<br />The movie is so bad, I don't know when I'll have the stomach to watch the other two discs. I suppose since I spent the money, I should steel my nerves and do so sometime. I already sat through some nearly unlistenable and insipid commentary on the film where the speakers tried so very hard to project erudition but instead exuded the acrid stench of pseudo-intellectual pretension.<br />The three discs came housed in a flimsy plastic dust cover that is already cracking like a piece of cheap plastic left too long in the sun. If you already like this movie, then you will probably not pause to reflect on a thing I wrote. But if you have not yet seen this unbearable nonsense packaged as a \\"cult classic\\", then I would recommend that you buy and watch a less expensive package before deciding to go whole-hog as I did.

After seeing this DVD, which is a delight and very funny, Dessay is my favorite soprano. For further evidence, see her Greatest Moments on Stage DVD, which has moments from three different versions of Tales of Hoffmann, all of which are totally over the top.
0783225903|5.0|No matter how many times I re-view this movie, I'm captivated by the it's emotonal realism, its hideous beauty, its magnificent sound and its music, and the wonderful acting of the ensemble.  But more than any of that, I'm astonished by the inescapable realization that the most intensely unpleasant aspects of what was intended as a satirical pre-view of the futue, has, in the two and a half decades since its inception, come to mordant life.  Our dim suspiscion of a decadent idiocy arising from an inbred society of rich money-changers, ruled by an inexpressibly foul and paracitic bureaucratic class rotten with envy, suspiscion and indifference to human suffering, has grown into an inescapable fact of contemporary life.  Alas!    But how was BRAZIL conceived?  How executed?  The mystery of Terry Gilliam's methods (and funding) remain opaque, but the magic of his mastery over the medium grows in a splendor that is dark and excruciating, but irresistable.    What excuse is there for not having viewed this film at leasst once?  I cannot conceive of any.

B0011FDVKE|5.0|Well, here I am back in the middle of the night reviewing a CD, listening on my headphones. I have listened to Tift Merritt before, but never reviewed anything by her.<br />  This is a really well done recording, it reminds me a bit of Shelby Lynne's last CD. The CD where she sings Dusty Springfield songs. It was another artists idea that she finally got around to.<br />  Well, let me tell you a bit of the story of \\"Another Country\\". Tift took off for Paris, France to stay in a friend's small apartment with a piano. All that she did was exist, play piano, write music, hang out with other artists and came back with some great material, that in the finished version sort of follows a theme.<br />  I really think this is going to be a great year for music, as soon as I took off six weeks to review some guitar pedals, all of these great CDs started coming out, I can't wait to get into Carlene Carter's new music, great stuff, from what I have heard. When times get tough, usually good music starts coming out as well as other artistic mediums. I will say that will I was playing the best guitar pedals in the land, my passion for playing came back, even with my chronic pain, I'm loving it again.<br />  Sometimes we need to do something different to get our inspiration back, for Merritt, it was go to Paris. She has made an awesome disc.<br />  Playing with some hot studio musicians, she really puts out some great, live sounding music.<br />  \\"Keep You Happy\\" is a ballad with acoustic guitar picking in beginning and some bell like (sounding)lead guitar. Doug Sax mastered this already great recording.<br />  I love the guitar playing of Charlie Sexton and Doug Pettibone. Produced by George Drakoulas. Some strings in the background of this song.<br />  \\"I Know What I'm Looking For Now\\" is an acoustic rhythmic sound with drums and full band. this recording tells the story of her Paris trip. More great guitar playing here, pedal steel with delay, just tonally grabbing. Some nice back ground vocals on this song.<br />  \\"Tell Me Something True\\" is a rocker with some horns and great lyrics.<br />  \\"My Heart Is free\\" rocks like a Mindy Smith song. The guitars are cooking, great melody. Another great set of lyrics.<br />  \\"Tender Branch\\" is a tender song that like a lot of these songs have a very live vibe. Oh Boy, there goes that guitar again, \\"increditone\\", Merritt's songwriting is nothing short of inspired on this disc.<br />  She finishes the disc singing a song in French, \\"Mille Tendresses\\".<br />  This CD picks up where Shelby Lynne and Allison Moorer left off. Just really hot inspired music. I love it. This is a must check out.<br /><br />[...]ck ground vocals on this song.<br />  \\"Tell Me Something True\\" is a rocker with some horns and great lyrics.<br />  \\"My Heart Is free\\" rocks like a Mindy Smith song.

B000002NZO|5.0|With all due respect to my fellow reviewers, I find it strange that nobody seems to be aware of the fact that Trepass is mainly Ant Phillips' masterpiece. His writing contribution as a percentage of the whole was very great. Peter Gabriel called him 'probably the most musical of all the members of Genesis' and he was right. Listen to Ants solo albums and you'll know what I mean. Trespass is pure magic, including its cover. Sure, Genesis grew and recorded even grander, at least more accessible stuff. But there would never be another Trespass.

B000059T1E|5.0|After another line-up of Traffic split in 1969, Steve Winwood played with the Blind Faith. After that, early in 1970, he planned to record a solo album. Yet, seeking musical partners tuned in the same way as himself, was a bit uneasy. That's why he gratefully accepted co-operation of his old Traffic friends, Chris Wood and Jim Capaldi, and after all the album, John Barleycorn Must Die, was issued under the Traffic heading.<br />The trio (S. W. - keyb, g, bg, perc, voc; C. W. - keyb, saxs, fl, perc; J. C. - ds) was in a wonderful shape that year. The 6 original tracks are a tremendous blend of various musical styles and influences, yet holding perfectly together on one album. The majority of tracks (4-7 min each) allows space for solo improvisations. The instrumental opener (\\"Glad\\") starts off with a rhythmic piano and woodwind riff, which might be, by current categorization, assigned even to funky jazz-rock. However, the composition spreads into sax and then keybord improvisations, the piano in the end sounding nearly like a classical one, almost impressionistic style. Track 2 (\\"Freedom Rider\\") begins with a sax motif (which might have been an inspiration for the sax jingle of the TV series on Hercule Poirot :-). A lovely flute solo is featured as well. In track 3 (\\"Empty Pages\\"), a melodic folk-like tune, Winwood's vocal (commonly somewhat strangled) sounds, especially in the refrain, almost like Phil Collins. Probably no guitars are employed in these 2 compositions (tracks 2 & 3). In contrast, one of the additional tracks that were included into this remastered reissue (track 4 - \\"I Just Want You to Know\\"), is a short tune based on vocal harmonies and then it features a lovely guitar solo. Track 6 is the outstanding title composition - an English folk ballad, \\"John Barleycorn Must Die.\\" As noted on the cover, the first record of this song appeared in 1465 in the age of James 1st. It is said to be about \\"the effort of people to give up the alcohol distilled from barley.\\" Track 7 (\\"Every Mothers Son\\") has appeared on some compilations of progressive rock of the time. It features a catchy legato guitar figure and later, this composition transforms into folk-rock'n'blues keyboard improvisations, with perfect, time-to-time even exalted Winwood's singing (of course, Winwood is no Freddie Mercury, but his voice is very functional and suitable for this kind of music). Tracks 7 & 8 were recorded only be 2 people - Winwood played everything except for drums.<br />The sound of this remaster is quite nice; to me, only the additional track 4 sounds somehow flatter. The 2 bonus tracks are very pleasing (the total time of the extended issue is no more than 39:31 min), and depite that in general, I quite dislike spreading the added material in between the original one, on this album, it is quite feasible (the extra material being track 4 and the last track 8): in case you don't have the original recording in your ears, you would not recognize the E.T.\\" among the old material. The cover is the original - very decent. It is an older painting provided by the English Folk Dance & Song Society; it depicts a faggot of barley(?).<br />Whom to recommend this music: to anyone who likes the progressive rock music with lots of improvisation of the turn of 1960's and 1970's. If you like Clapton, Blind Faith etc., and the British folk, you won't be dissapointed. This record is superb, 5 stars..\\" Track 7 (\\"Every Mothers Son\\") has appeared on some compilations of progressive rock of the time.

1416914307|5.0|It felt like it took forever for this book to come out, but boy was it worth the agonizing wait.<br /><br />This book sucked me in right from the beginning, just like the first two books in the series did. Cassandra Clare has a way with words that make you feel like you're in the Shadowhunter world. To keep this review short, since I could go on for a long, long time, I'll just say that it didn't disappoint me at all. Everything happened at the perfect pace and things were resolved in a way that I thought was perfect. The characters stayed true to themselves and I think every single character grew stronger. And I must say, Cassandra Clare had my heart stopping a few times. A few things in this book really shocked me and a few things I saw coming.<br /><br />I just have to get over this series being over! I look forward to reading more of Clare's work.
B001K3JF7K|5.0|I love the music of Diana Krall.  Her music is so soothing and romantic.  I have to be in a romantic or relaxed mood to listen to her music, and I am most of the time. I love \\"Walk On By\\". I know this song has been covered by many other artists, but Diana has the ability to make a song her own.  \\"Guess I'll Hang My Tears Out To Dry\\" is a new song to me.  Diana makes heart break sound so beautiful on this song.  \\"The Boy From Ipanema\\" is Diana's take on a classic song about a sexy man who makes women swoon.  I love the Spanish track \\"Este Seu Olhar\\".  \\"I've Grown Accustomed His Face\\" is a song dedicated to her husband Elvis Costello.  I don't understand a word of the Spanish song \\"Este Seu Olhar\\" but it sounds lovely.  \\"So Nice\\" has a light breezy sound.  Diana covers \\"How Do You Mend A Broken Heart\\"  so well.  I almost forgot what the original sounds like. \\"Too Marvelous For Words\\" and \\"Quiet Nights\\" are perfect songs to listen to while snuggling with someone special. I love her piano playing throughout this disc.

B001O1O71C|5.0|The Boy in the Stiped Pajamas, by John Boyne was an amazing audio book. Here is what the back of the audio book says about the story:<br /><br />.....Audio book description<br />\\"The story of The Boy in the Striped Pajamas is very difficult to describe. Usually we give some information about the audio book, but in this case we think that would spoil the listening. We think it's important that you start to listen without knowing what it is about. If you do start to listen, you will go on a journey with a nine-year-old boy named Bruno. (Though this isn't a story for nine-year-olds.) And sooner or later, you will arrive with Bruno at the fence. Fences like this exist all over the world. We hope that you never have to encounter such a fence.\\"<br />Classified as a book for Young Adults, the story is told through the eyes of 9-year old, Bruno who returns home from school one day, and is told that his whole family (mother, father, sister) are moving far away because of his father's job promotion. He must leave his huge house in the heart of Berlin, and move to a place called \\"Out With\\" (Auschwitz), a place in Poland. Bruno is a lonely, and a pretty naive young boy. He is very unhappy in \\"Out With\\" as he must leave all his old friends behind. One day from his window, Bruno notices a tall fence running farther than his eyes can see. There seem to be lots of people gathered beyond the fence, and Bruno is curious about what he sees in the distance.<br /><br />Since Bruno has always wanted to be an explorer, he wants to learn more about the area around him, and hopes to meet some friends as well. One day he meets a boy the same age as himself, who even has the same birth date as Bruno. The boy is named Schmuel, and he is very thin, his skin is gray in color and his eyes are set deeply. He realizes that the boy is hungry too. The two boys meet for one year along the fence to talk; Bruno even brings the boy food from time to time. He asks why the boy gets to wear his \\"striped pajamas every day\\"? The boy tells him that everyone dresses the same. Each day, the two children meet and talk, and each day Bruno learns a little more about his new friend and the people he lives with.<br /><br />Bruno's innocence about what is going on around him seems very unbelievable, but what this innocence does is make the conclusion of this book all the more shocking. This is one story I will never forget. I look forward to seeing the movie based on this book as well, even though the topic: Nazi Germany and the Holocaust is a tough topic to read about or view.

B00139XZF4|3.0|The Golden Compass is an entertaining film with an intriguing story line. It falls short in many areas however so I'd recommend it but not very enthusiastically. The film makers build a very exotic world for the story. However, one of my main criticisms is, you know it's an artificial world. You always are aware the cast is working in front of a green screen. You never lose the feeling you're watching a digital world or get to immerse yourself in the story.  The demons or external representation of the characters souls are beautifully render. Pan, Lyra Belaqua's demon, is an excellent character.    The casting is good but the performances are only average. Nicole Kidman is great as the evil Mrs. Coulter. Her character is at times violent and always creepy and mysterious. Dakota Richards as the lead character, Lyra Belaqua, is very good and has some great scenes. The rest of the performances are only average. You've seen Sam Elliot play the same western hero a million times already and this isn't one of the better performances of it. The digital character Iorek Byrnison might be the best of the whole film. He is a drunken, exiled king of the armored bears. He is truly courageous and very easy to like with his flaws and fears.    Now to the main criticism of the film, the story. It develops very slowly, is confusing as heck at times, and does not have an ending in this film. It latterly ends with the characters wrapping up what happened here and what needs to happen in the next film. It's very disappointing. The pacing was awful. Some parts that have little to do with the story take forever to develop and other key parts are flown past with little explanation. Don't bother watching if you like your stories to have a beginning a build to a climax and an ending because you won't get that here. It might be worth waiting for the second film so you can get closure in one viewing of them both.    Additionally, I'd warn parents to view this before deciding to let their children watch it. I'm not sure some of it is really appropriate for the age I would expect to be really interested in this film. It is very dark; there are some really disturbing scenes with the children and their demons. There is also a lot of death and killing in it. It's hard to over look someone dying when their demon animal burst in to flam and is consumed to ashes. And that happens frequently here. The bear fight between Iorek Byrnison and the current bear king ends in an extremely brutal and graphic sequence.    Technically, the blue-ray disc is outstanding. The transfer is crisp, clean and highly detailed. The sound track is excellent as are the effects. I'd recommend it as a blue-ray demo disc for sure.    So, I'd recommend the film just not every enthusiastically.

I told my daughter that I would read it at the same pace as her class, but I found I couldn't put it down and had to speed ahead of their slow pace. What were my teachers thinking to have left this off the list?  A beautiful piece of literary fiction with meaningful metaphors and lessons on tolerance that we could all still benefit from today.

B001JV5BIA|4.0|I too was curious about this release.  What was different in this release vs. the 2-sided DVD released by MGM in 2002 and now out of print?  I have both and they are different.  The 2002 release was a 2-sided DVD, one side was standard, the other side was widescreen with some extras on both side.  The 2002 version has about a 15 minute version of outtakes and dailies with no sound.    In here we see lots of outtakes from the horrible murder of Phyllis.  Lots of fake looking footage of Sadie caressing Phyllis' innards, something only glimpsed for a second or two in the movie.  Nasty stuff for sure.  Also on the 2002 release is a featurette \\"Forbidden Footage\\".  Its about 10 minutes long and consists mostly of Wes and Sean discussing how prints of the movie came back all chopped up from irate theater owners and religious folk who were horrified by some of the footage.              This new 1-sided 2009 release has a much better documentary titled \\"Celluloid Crime of the Century\\" that was produced in 2002 in the UK and runs about 40 minutes.  Jeramie Rain (Sadie) looks fabulous in her fifties and it contains interviews with Wes, Sean, David Hess, Fred Lincoln and Marc Sheffler (you'd never recognize him) but the poor girls are not included.    The outtakes and dailies from the 2002 version are not on this DVD and neither is \\"Forbidden Footage\\".   But there is new footage never seen before that also has no sound.  There is a lot of nudity in this footage from the scenes where Mari and Phyllis are forced to make it with each other in the woods and it also contains (soft-core) scenes of Sadie performing oral sex on Mari. (Are they selling this at Wal Mart??)  There is also an extra scene of the parents finding Mari alive by the lake, kind of like what they did in the remake.  There are a couple of other extras too:  some short film made by Wes which I haven't yet watched and another chat with Wes that must have been made recently because he discusses the new remake and how he came to produce it.  He really liked the new remake, more than I could say.  IMHO, the new one isn't nearly as sick and disgusting as the original.        So the difference is in the extras.   The movie appears to be the exact same version on both.

B001P3SA94|2.0|The music was good. The people seemed real but skin-deep: booze, drugs, guns, stupidity, self-destructive violence and instant sex. There's no depth to any of the characters. The question remains how can you make a movie with Chess treating his artists like children financially (read\\" PATERNALLY), but the movie doesn't make clear if he is scamming them or not.  Muddy Waters doesn't seem to have a clue what money is his and how much and why. Chess buys him a car as if he's an empty-headed girlfriend, and as such gets paid with whatever Chess decides to give him. Etta James decides he \\"loved her\\" because he left her the deed (doesnt say mortgage is paid off) of a house that cost in 1970 (year Chess died) about $35,000. Chess sold his company for over $6,000,000, and that doesnt count the millions he made on the way up. In short, they had an opportunity to make a complex character, and instead make a superficial and (almost boring) one.
B0002OERI0|1.0|Man, these guys are really messed up! They have some great rhythms and then they have to mess them up with the stupid lyrics, I mean when will the IDIOCY on their part end? Can't they at least leave the \\"F\\" word out of their songs!?
B001MYIXAC|5.0|I wasn't sure what to expect when I heard about this movie, outside the idea that it was a vampire story with a younger cast. What I took away from this movie was a sense of being an awkward 12 year old again and learning what it means to fall in love for the first time. Only with a vampire! This movie really is done so well and is so difficult to describe. Is it a love story? Yes. A horror flick? Yes. But done so dramatically and far-removed from the usual schlock like \\"Twilight\\" and other cheap knock-offs.    and FYI: If you want to watch the movie the way it was intended, you have to TAKE OFF THE DUBBING ON YOUR TV! Most televisions will have the option to take over dubbing \\"off\\" and turn \\"on\\" the english subtitles. Otherwise you're getting, as one reviewer stated, a \\"bad godzilla movie\\".

B001ZRYQSO|5.0|I have listened to this collection four or five times now and am genuinely amazed at each listening.  If you know Leonard Cohen's work, this album is going to be your favorite.  It is a look at his career, his humor, yes, I said humor, and his darkness.  The live recording is warm, and the sound is inviting.  The band is flawless.  You will not be disappointed.
B0000630YA|3.0|To many Alice Cooper fans, this was the beginning of the end.  Welcome to my Nightmare has some fine songs but has an aura of a \\"solo\\" record...which it was.  Leaving behind the original Alice Cooper Group, Alice moves on to solo stardom with this album.  Some tracks such as the title track, \\"Escape\\" \\"The Awakening\\" & \\"Cold Ethyl\\" are great.  Others like \\"Some Folks\\" and especially the kiddie choir of \\"Department of Youth\\" left me feeling like Alice turned a corner.  Gone was the creepiness of \\"Killer\\" in which Alice delivers a monotone talk style vocal of a man who realizes he's just killed...very real sounding.  Alice replaced this with campiness.  The Vincent Price monologue is a prime example.  CAMPEEEE!!!  I was 13 when this album came out and realized something had changed in the Coop.  All of a sudden he was Hollywood Squares!  The people who adore Welcome to my Nightmare are the same ones who thought it was cool that Alice was on The Muppets.  Me?  I like to remember him with a noose around his neck in the poster/calendar from the Killer album.  :)
B001PPLIEG|4.0|I've been around since Doctor No was released, and had read all the books before that.  I appreciate getting away from all the gadgets, and Daniel Craig is an excellent Bond.  But I find myself imagining Christian Bale as Bond.  Of course, he'd probably only do one movie as the character, but what a Bond he would be.
B001RTP3YQ|5.0|Leonard Cohen is still a magnificent performer, even at 73-years old, and this concert captures that fact wonderfully.  This two-disc cd set was recorded live at the concert in London at the O2 Arena on July 17th, 2008.  Sony has done a marvelous job in putting this package together.  Both cds are filled to maximum capacity and Amazon's tracklisting above is correct.  There are several nice photographs of the event in the included booklet with liner notes by John Aizlewood.<br /><br />The performance is spectacular on this set and very typical of the level of quality the current world tour has been regularly achieving at various venues.  The backing singers and band members are all in top form and Leonard himself sounds in good voice.  Sharon Robinson and the Webb sisters provide background vocals, while Roscoe Beck, Neil Larsen, Javier Mas, Bob Metzger, Dino Soldo, and Rafael Bernando Gayol comprise the band.  Leonard throws out some light banter at times and probably is too gracious in the regular and profuse compliments he gives out to his supporting players.<br /><br />On a technical level the recording is very good and sounds better than most live cds.  The cds are mastered by Bob Ludwig, a well-known and respected mastering engineer.  He did a fine job here as the music shows no signs of overcompression or clipping.  The audience is well-behaved and generally can not be heard during the songs, though vigorous applause greets each song and Leonard's sly jokes.<br /><br />The set captures the live magic of Leonard Cohen's current tour with many fine performances.  While not every song on here is the definitive live version, many are great like \\"Tower Of Song\\" and \\"Who By Fire\\".  Anyone with a marginal interest in the music of Leonard Cohen needs to pick up this cd set.  It is essential in my estimation as a document of Leonard Cohen's current live performances.  Hopefully more dates from this tour will be officially released.

B001K3JF7K|3.0|I have been a big fan of Diana Krall since the mid-1990's, and I own everything she's released under her name except \\"Stepping Out\\" and her recent greatest-hits CD. I also love bossa nova. \\"Quiet Nights\\" is a decent tribute to that kind of music and is strong in several respects. First, I think the choice of material is pretty good (see the other reviews for a description of the songs). Second, the arrangements by Claus Ogerman are lush and beautiful, as always (listen to Diana's \\"Look of Love\\" CD for more great Ogerman arrangements). Third, Diana's piano playing on \\"Quiet Nights,\\" what there is of it, is tasty and interesting, as always.    What disappointed me here is that Diana adopted a very breathy, whispered singing style for much of this album, and I just don't enjoy that kind of singing. I much prefer the way she sang on her earlier albums, where she used that \\"breathiness\\" more sparingly and to good effect. This is something each listener will have to gauge for himself or herself. It's simply a matter of personal taste. In my opinion, \\"The Look of Love\\" (2001) is similar in tone but superior to \\"Quiet Nights.\\" For my taste, the singing approach and the choice of material there is better than on \\"Quiet Nights.\\" My recommendation is to listen to the samples to determine whether you like this breathy style of singing before you buy, even if you consider yourself a Diana Krall fan.
B001P9KR8U|4.0|I did not see this Academy Award winning \\"darling\\" in the theatres last year so I can only review it based on the DVD version (not Blu-ray). From all the press and the awards it won, it became known as the Indian \\"Rocky\\". The \\"little film that could\\".<br /><br />I watched the DVD on a moderately large TV screen and from the first few moments had a trouble with the subtitles. Unlike the usual \\"bottom of the screen\\" titles, Director Danny Boyle gets \\"cutesy\\" and has them appear at various places on the screen. Sometime upper right; sometimes left center. And they are not only in smaller print than most subtitles but they appear in colored boxes. Sort of reminds me of those \\"trivia bits\\" that some nostalgia films add. Now the film is MOSTLY in English but there are large portions in the first half that are in Hindi and need translation to know what is being said. This was enough to drop a full star off my rating. I'm not sure how this all came across in the theatres. Your eyes need to scan the screen, as you never know where the subtitle will appear. (Question: Is it still a \\"subtitle\\" when it appears in the upper right part of the screen?)<br /><br />The other thing that got me about the film is the amazing amount of violence. There is a lot of graphic violence going on here and definitely not for kids. The major emotional moments at the end of the film - both the \\"will he get the Ru 20,000,000 answer right?\\" one and the \\"will the lovers finally get together?\\" one - are underscored by either the \\"So You Want To be a Millionaire\\" theme or the crescendo building love theme. Director Boyle has your emotions programmed.<br /><br />The story did capture my interest- once I got past the subtitle issue - I did cheer Jamal on, just like I did Ken Jennings (on the U.S. Version). And, like nearly everyone who sees this film I wondered \\"what happens next?\\".<br /><br />There is certainly plenty of bonus material for the commentary lovers. There are two - at 2 hours each - plus the \\"making of\\" documentary, deleted scenes and a 6-minute music video of the prime scenes.<br /><br />I'm not sure it was great enough to win an Oscar, but it sure is worth seeing once, in my opinion.ted scenes and a 6-minute music video of the prime scenes.

0312330537|2.0|I started out loving this book, some of the prose was amazing and I marked some passages for later use.  After page 150, my \\"I like this\\" marks fell sharply away and then disappeared after page 385 ... but the story continued, and continued, and continued.  Because the beginning was so good, I tried to finish but gave up around page 426 feeling angry.  It is almost as if someone else stepped in to finish the book - perhaps the author had a contract to get to 1,000 pages rather than stop at 500???
B001LF4IA6|3.0|Bruce gets credit for stepping up the release of new material. Rock and roll needs a leader and he still has things to say. This album has its moments, but it feels like what it is, leftover songs from Magic and a few other odds and ends. And a couple of excellent songs, such as My Lucky Day, What Love Can Do, This Life, and Kingdom of Days. The arrangements, however, often cross that fine line -- as Spinal Tap says -- from clever to stupid. The arrangement of Kingdom of Days builds to a sappy crescendo that pretty much wrecks it. Same for This Life. Working on A Dream is  a terrific song that is not helped by the silly whistling solo. Surprise Surprise Suprise has an appealing melody that suffers from trite lyrics and the Gomer Pyle refrain. Outlaw Pete is ambitious but ultimately just so-so (it may unfortunately consume precious time in concert). Queen of the Supermarket is another great melody; the sentiment is nice, but the lyrics veer too close to someone writing a parody of a blue-collar Bruce song (\\"as the evening sky turns blue, a dream awaits in aisle number two, with my shopping cart I move through the heart...\\"). Tomorrow Never Knows is a comfortable, out-of-place shuffle with a strange, TV-commericial-type arrangement.    The arrangement of Life Itself actually works really well. My Lucky Day is terrific. If Bruce could tweak the other songs to add a little New Jersey swagger, it would make a huge difference.      With the worst economic downturn since the Great Depression, Bruce is uniquely qualified to mount a tour that speaks to America's heart and broken dreams. Don't just recycle the Magic tour, Bruce. We need you to dig deep and mix the best of your past songs (please no more Mary's Place and Working on a Sunny Day) with some of your fine new songs. Maybe in concert some of the new songs will get new arrangements and take on new life. America needs Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band to bring us back to the church of rock and roll.

After years of weight training and cardio work this video still kicks my butt, and it is so fun!  I actually re-incorporated it into my weekly workout routine again, it is great for toning...and you do actually break a sweat doing the leg workout/cardio section.
0452289963|5.0|Eckhart Tolle shares with us how we can figure out our Life Purpose.  This is a companion book to his best selling, The Power of Now.  He easily explains the difference between being and doing, and shows us how to be who we want to be.  If you want some illumination into what your life is about, then you will read this with unbridled enthusiasm.    Many have explained the concept of Heaven on Earth and Eckhart explains how this can occur - with our help.  This planet many call, \\"the third rock from the Sun,\\" is where we all live and when we act as if the earth is our friend, as are all others, then this will become the new earth.  Here we learn about our ego and our uniqueness, and the power of transcending this to Oneness with All.
1592402690|5.0|Emerick freely admits what he was and was not present for during the Beatles' career and his knowledge of recording and production is not only self-evident from his work, but from the words on the page.  I was recommended this book by a fellow musician, having become bored with the same old third-hand stories.  The recent materialization of take 20 of Revolution (whether it is real or not) is pretty interesting considering it was around this time Emerick had simply had it with John's new \\"anti-Pepper\\" aggression.<br /><br />This is a book for people who want to know how records are made.  George's transformation to a lousy guitarist to the man who had the guts to replay his solo on the same track as an orchestra in one take on \\"Something\\" is told with glorious detail.  John's loony ideas are often recounted with a sort of humorous glee.  Paul's dedication to the band, the reproduction of sound, and his own bass parts are clearly the most impressing memories Emerick shares.<br /><br />Overall, this book is one of the only books to read with a new take on an old story.
B001K3JF7K|5.0|I love this album. This album has a great selection of songs and Diana Krall's voice is just dreamy! I think this is her best work to date.
B001PJ7TUE|5.0|I've been a Prodigy fan since the release of their first album, though it was their second album that really solidified my love for the band.  I didn't really enjoy their last outing Always Outgunned.      Invaders Must Die is an amazing return to form for Liam Howlett.  There is not a single filler track in this album.  Every single song is like a delicious morsel to be tasted, savored, chewed over and ingested.  It's instantly likable, and yet durable.  Nearly every track is brimming with great dance energy.  My absolute favorite track, though, is the last track 'Stand up', which is warm and steady, and wraps itself around me like a warm blanket and serves me hot Chicken Soup in front of the fireplace.  It's just that scrumptious.
B000LC4CVA|5.0|As I was cruising the TV dial and I just caught the last 3 minutes of their  presentation on PBS. I was hooked.  These ladies would never make it on American Idol.  They sing on key, sing at the appropriate musical levels, never shout, never jump around, make no hand motions, dress appropriately, smile at the audience, and  they even curtsy at the end of their song, while all the time looking absolutely beautiful.  A  wonderfull DVD.  You can appreciate their wide  vocal range by listening to their West Side Story rendition done without musical accompaniment.  Before this, I couldn't believe a fiddler could dance and fiddle at the same time.  The setting at Slate Castle and the editing of the DVD was  excellent. If you listen carefully, you will see that the drummers(2) balance out the orchestra and singers beautifully.  I'm sold.
B0017ANAZO|5.0|and humor as Meg Ryan's character finds out that her dim witted husband is cheating on her with the Spritzer girl (Eva Mendes). Who does her thing in her role as the other woman.  Also along for the ride are Annette Benning, Debra Messing, Jada Pinkett Smith, Cloris Leachment, Candice Bergen and Bette Midler as well.  They all add something to this movie to make it more than just a woman done wrong story.  It's about a woman that finds out that underneath all the endless parties, gardening and other busy things.  She has a life of her own and she fully realizes that.<br /><br />I enjoyed every bit of the film that gets you into it straight from the beginning.  Now i have never watched the original so I don't know if its better or now.  But i wouldn't compare them regardless because despite this one being a remake.  It still more than holds its own and is something that is very rent and purchase worthy as well.  Great energy between the actresses throughout the movie and directed well by Diane English.<br /><br />Loads of laughs and outrageous comments throughout this one that are sure to have you laughing out loud as well.
B001FBSMF8|4.0|I am finding it very interesting how so many people are quite worked up about this album as if it is the end, beginning or growth of a very talented singer who in the modern ROCK era is quite unmatched. However, on his last two albums his voice did not shine...his last solo and Revelations by Audioslave were well below the Cornell standard.    Say what you will about this album it is what it is...different on the whole while \\"Two Drink Minimum\\" could have been on a previous Chris album this is not your Soundgarden, Temple, Audioslave (and forget about Audioslave, Rage is back and there will be no reunion) or previous solo work in genre but Chris' voice is very distinct and sounds drug and tobacco free for the first time in a while so that is something.    Did he sell-out or branch out? Does it really matter? He explored another form of music that sometimes succeeds and sometimes fails (looping and overproduction are not exactly aspects of studio recording I can get behind) but it is what it is and even if the SOUND is very different if you like Chris you should check it out and decide for yourself. I could give you my opinion as a musician, singer or 38yo who is a Seattle Native who was around when Soundgarden was still a club band but who cares?    Like it, Love it or Hate it...it should make for good conversation WITH YOUR FRIENDS but honestly all this cyberblabbing just made me confused and amused...DECIDE FOR YOURSELF!     If you really want MY OPINION which is not the point of my review I like it which is why I gave it 4 Stars.    People I know/knew flipped-out when Chris put out \\"Euphoria Morning\\" and I myself had it for years before I really appreciated it for what it is, his best solo album, because it was such a huge DEPARTURE from Soundgarden! Some people just can't handle CHANGE and when it comes to music I can understand this as I have been guilty myself many times. However, if you have been a longtime Cornell fan I think you will find it enjoyable from the first listen, rather you will listen to it over and over or rarely thereafter who knows but again DON'T LET SOMEONE ELSE DECIDE FOR YOU WHAT TO LISTEN TO this is the whole problem with the music industry today!    As far as the producer, I have heard of him and frankly have no comment as I don't really listen to artists he is known for producing but he did a good collaboration here. I will not start seeking out his other work for comparison but it worked on this album.
B000002N2P|5.0|With Insomniac, Green Day took everything that was great about Dookie, and amped it up to the next level, much like Weezer's transition from the Blue Album to Pinkerton. It's darker, sure, but they found a way to take the sound of Punk-Rock and make it something so much more. The passion behind this album is intense, and sorely underrated.     I tried thinking of the key tracks, but really, it's easier and shorter to list off the forgettable ones. Every single song on this album stands out except, for me, the Panic Song and Stuart and the Ave. Other than that, this album is solid gold. If you're a punker looking for some inspiration with your band, or just want to hear something great that you'll be playing non-stop for days, this album is essential. It's also great to start off with as a new Green Day fan.

B001FA0WI4|5.0|As someone who grew up in the former Soviet Union with distant family members who perished under Stalin I thoroughly appreciated this book. I am giving it 5 stars, even though the author use dias ex machina too much. Sometimes the events turn too conveniently for the story to reflect reality, and some names and Russian words have not been transliterated from Russian to English the way I would have done it as a native speaker.    That said, though, the story is compelling and realistic. And to the reviewer who complained that there are too many conversations and not enough action -- get over yourself, you are not reading a beach novel or a crime mystery. During the Stalin years the conversations themselves were a crime.
B000EHSVQ4|5.0|The theatrical release of Kingdom of Heaven was interesting to me because I am an amateur historian, but the film was notably flawed and felt too forced in some areas. The director's cut, while still not a perfect movie, has made up for many of those problems: It gives more substance to the characters of Balian and Sibylla, and in doing so it gives both a more vivid and somewhat more accurate portrait of what life was really like nearly 1000 years ago. The performances in this film are really stellar, with the unfortunate exception of the movie's star, Orlando Bloom. He's not a bad actor but I just get the sense he was miscast in this movie. All the rest of the actors are absolutely fantastic: Liam Neeson is once again at his grumbly, father-figure best, Marton Czokas makes a believably hatable villain, Eva Green is magnificent as the Queen of Jerusalem. Of course, the real standout here is Ed Norton as the leper king Baldwin. Unfortunately, the only flaw I found with the director's cut is that it seems that much of his dialogue was redubbed and sounds more muffled and low-quality than the original theatrical release. Having had a pretty good idea of how his performance in the original release went, it was slightly disconcerting to hear the strange drop in sound quality in this version.    But aside from that, this movie is a huge step up in cinematic quality from its original version. If you liked the original, you will love the Director's Cut.

B000W00Y0Y|5.0|I was fortunate to see Queen twice during the \\"Jazz\\" tour and they were a terrific live act to say the least.  This I believe is the tour for \\"The Game\\", but the set design is basically the same although Freddy had moved on from his \\"Biker\\" persona to a more wistful and sometimes shirtless version of himself.  Let me just say that this is Queen at their very, very best live.  They were totally in sync with each other musically and the songs have a spark and a rhythm that I've never heard before.  The Live Aid portion of the disc is amazing.  I saw this performance on television back in '85 and my recollection of it doesn't  compare to what is actually was.  For one thing, the sound now is beyond anything that existed back then.  The fidelity is surprisingly full and clear.  The picture is also quite fantastic especially considering that this was recorded on video tape nearly 25 years ago.  One can actually see some detail in the phenomenal crowd on the reverse wide shots (what the performers were looking at).  That being said, it's too bad that this history making show wasn't captured on film.  The aspect ratio is only 4:3 and I can only imagine how incredible the images could have been with a clearer and wider perspective.  Even so, I was actually very impressed with the camera work given the obvious limitations that the crew were saddled with.  The Live Aid section is worth the price of this alone!  If you have the means, get this on Blu-Ray as the picture and sound are incomparable.
0307269752|1.0|I might have appreciated this book more if it went by its original title, Men Who Hate Women, since that has more resonance to the story inside than simply naming the book after a secondary sidekick character, Lisbeth Salander aka \\"the girl with the dragon tattoo.\\" Granted, she is about the only thing I found interesting in the entire book, but despite how unique the author tried to make her I found it pretty lame that she, just like every other \\"beautiful\\" female character in the book just could not keep her hands off boring Blomkivist, the main character of the story.  What a lucky guy that he has three beautiful women to bed whenever he gets bored sifting through the entire Vanger family history to find out where Harriet Vanger disappeared to forty some years ago. That's probably how he didn't die of boredom.  I made it through the whole book because I figured, wow, the ending must be pretty good if there's so much hype over the book.  I was disappointed.  The whole book is basically the main charcter reading papers and researching and looking at photographs.  The author goes into an incredible amount of detail into the Vanger family history, but it is just boring facts.  Most of it has nothing to do with the missing girl, and is just trivial facts about the Vanger family and its many members.  The climax of the book where the truth is revealed and the action takes place should have been the most interesting part of the book, however it is the shortest part of the book, about a chapter.  There is almost no details about what actually went on, no descriptions of the evil deeds that happened, which surprises me because there was so much detail about every other aspect of the history, and then the truth is just kind of brushed off.  The villain of the story might as well be a silhouette and is not defined at all, therefore not scary or dangerous really and just about as boring as every other part of the book.  The author seems sexist since he makes the three main female characters in the book all sex objects for the main character, Blomkvist.  No matter who they are they all seem to want him and are all perfectly ok with him sleeping with other women.  In fact, that's how they want it!  Isn't that awesome?!?  That's the real mystery of the book, why they want him, because he seems to have no personality.  This book didn't have much personality either.  It seems more like a detailed family tree than a mystery novel.  I'd recommend it if you are looking for a bunch of family facts, business jargon, money talk and a little mystery on the side. Because the mystery really is on the sidelines with this book.male characters in the book all sex objects for the main character, Blomkvist.

Brent has taken the songwriting to a new level with his absurdly intricate riffing, and a sense of awesome doom pervades the whole thing. Drumming is impeccable again, and I really like the more melodic vocals - some great 3 part harmonies on the \\"Last Baron\\". You can even hear the bass this time! No its not as thrashy as Remission, but the day Mastodon remakes an album will be the first time they will disappoint.

I downloaded these files and while they are technically a higher bitrate (and larger to prove it) they do not sound as good as the ones I had before. The hiss on these files is audible and maddening. This is an old record, but the masters must be in very good shape because I have heard versions with no hiss, and total clarity on CD. My old 192k mp3s had the expected digital artifacts, but NO hiss. Do not download from here if you're expecting a crisp mastering.    Long story short (too late) the drums are muddy.    Sidenote: This version has the now seemingly standard truncated track \\"Pale Gallery\\" reduced by nearly three minutes. Also, the files are not 256k CBR, they are VBR, in the 230k-range.
1416955070|4.0|If I had read the reviews before I bought this book I wouldn't have bought this book, however, I took a trip to the bookstore and spent a hour browsing books trying to decide which to buy and chose this one, and I am glad I did.    Personally I thought this book was wonderful. It had it's flaws, such as being predictable, but it definitely kept my interest and I moved on to the 2nd book which isn't as equally predictable. I'm a 21 year old, married, mother who loves teen fiction. What can I say, I'm a sucker for romantic, demon fantasies.    My point is, I loved this entire series and am glad I bought it before I read the reviews!
B001VSZ7RQ|5.0|This is music I expect from Keith - and he delivered!!!  Thanks Amazon for the deal too. Made my day all the way around!
B0010KHOS0|5.0|I loved this movie.  I love the music and the honesty.  The extended cut version has some interesting new scenes.
0060763280|5.0|This book definitely gets to the core of how spending habits can affect your life. And it give you tips on how to be aware and change the way you think of money.
B000RPTQ1C|5.0|This album was purchased after seeing ColdPlay on CBS Sunday Morning.  It is absolutely great!  All of the songs are good and it is very easy to listen too.  If you like U2 or Hootie, I think you will like this ColdPlay album.  Highly recommended!
0307269752|5.0|This book was the best read I have had in months (and I do read a lot!). Nothing since has come anywhere near the sheer 'immersion factor' this gripping novel exerts on the reader. The plot is complex, clever, the characters all utterly convincing (Lisbeth being a real masterstroke ), the general atmosphere rather spooky and very nordic...It is a hit on all sides and I could not recommend it strongly enough to everyone. The only downside is the cover jacket and the title, misleading potential readers into believing that the book is about a chinese woman. A very stupid decision from the english publisher.<br />I wish to add to this review, that I wrote when I only had read the first volume , in english. Now a few months later, I have read the two following volumes in french, because I could simply not wait years until the English publisher decides to release the whole three. This waiting time in between volumes is simply ridiculous as we are dealing here with possibly the most gripping trilogy ever written.<br />I must say that the two to come are just as brilliant, clever and immensely satisfying as the first. Rarely is a plot so twisted, so interesting, the characters so genuine and ultimately the whole story so resounding.<br />I deeply regret that Larsson died (or was help to die ??) and that we will never have another chapter in the tormented life of Lisbeth Salander.
0525951113|1.0|I had heard about this book on a radio program.  It sounded like a good book and one I would enjoy.  I did not like the book.  The idea of the daemon is good and a real possiblility, but the story line was not to my liking.  I would not recommend the book.
B00005N6KG|4.0|Great sound, light weight, stays in place good when on the treadmill.  I really like the quality of the overall headpiece.  I am a little concerned about durability.  The sound reproduction is great.  Recommended for those who want an inexpensive headpiece.
B0001NBMEE|5.0|We have really enjoyed watching this together as a family - there's something for everyone from princesses to a prince to even the bad guy in King Arthur's Court.  It is what it is - a fun family movie that capture children's imaginations and we parents don't have to worry about foul language.  Sure wish the \\"new\\" hollywood would make fun, clean movies keeping wholesome family viewing in mind!  That is the reason we love this movie - kid's don't need the sleekness and side, mature jokes that come out in current movies - this movie is fun and great to watch - highly recommend it! =-)    5 Stars!!! for family viewing!!!
B0002F6AH0|5.0|My wife and I bought this for our 14 year old grandson who is learning  in school about the Holocaust.  This was part of his Christmas present.  He was very taken by this DVD and became even more sympathetic towards  what happened during this period in time.  He lent it to some school-  mates and teacher.  They were very greatful to be able to see this DVD.
6305972591|2.0|I have a glimpse of a memory from when I was ten or so.  It is of this film's climax, giant fields of corn, some sort of malevolent creature burrowing through the ground like a mole on coke, and crosses of corn exploding into the air.  I only saw fragments because my parents were watching the film, but at the time, it freaked me out.<br /><br />This is probably because my father is a Baptist minister, lending all sorts of sobriety to the image of crosses, and also because I grew up in southeast Missouri, around dozens and dozens of cornfields.<br /><br />I wanted to be scared like that again, so I got the [[ASIN:B0001W1BZU Children]] [[ASIN:B00005NTMZ of]] [[ASIN:B00005NTN0 the]] [[ASIN:B00005NTN1 Corn]] [[ASIN:B00000K31U ser]][[ASIN:B00005NTN2 ies]].  Instead of being scared, however, I have been afforded the opportunity to warn others of my mistake.<br /><br />In the first five minutes of this film, all the children of the podunk town of Gatlin, Nebraska kill every last citizen over the age of 19.  That's the first five minutes, mind you.  The entire incident is narrated nonchalantly by young Job (Robby Kiger), who is annoyed that his mother and father have been slain, but who isn't necessarily put out by the ordeal.<br /><br />Because, you see, Job and his sister Sarah (who, for no reason whatsoever, can draw the future), are kept alive by the band of murderous children, who are acting at the behest of Issac, a legitimately creepy child who is acting as the prophet of He Who Walks Behind the Rows (of corn).  Issac is played by John Franklin, a twenty-five year old whose Growth Hormone Disorder makes him seem just the right kind of disturbing for the part.  After murdering all of the adults, the town of Gatlin enters a three-year grace period, where, for some reason, absolutely no investigation or inquiry is made into the town's sudden lack of taxpayers.  What, the relatives of these murdered adults don't worry that their family doesn't respond to mail or phone calls?  How is that this place still gets electricity, gas, and water after all of the breadwinners have been dispatched?  Ah, but I'm thinking too much.  Ha ha.  Silly me.<br /><br />Anyway, enter Burt (a laconic Peter Horton) and Vicky (a younger, sexier Linda Hamilton), two thirty-somethings entering the picture purely by accident when they happen to collide with Issac's latest victim, a young defector whose name I don't care to look up.<br /><br />King has always taken issue with fundamentalism, and his work reflects that.  I can't testify to how true this film is to the short story that inspired it, but that fanatical religious fervor is present here in undiluted form.  Who knows what these kids are worshipping?  Not even them it seems.  Whatever it is, it enjoys bloodshed and corn, and it hates adults (if you define adult as 20+ years of age).<br /><br />Aside from the story's basic incomprehensibility, the movie is uneventful and horribly acted.  It's a rough deal when the bulk of your cast is children, especially when said children are directed to act menacing.  The most violent child of all, Malachai (Courtney Gains), tries to leer and sneer with the best of them, but mostly what I noticed was his abnormally large mouth.  He screams a bit, Issac screams a bit, Burt takes it all in stride, and a kid named Amos gets a pentagram carved into his chest<br /><br />It's all rather mundane and dull.  In fact, I think the movie glossed over the scariest part.  What I would've liked to have seen is the preface to all of this weirdness.  Instead of making a movie about the aftermath, they should've written a story about Issac discovering He Who Walks Behind the Rows, about him convincing an entire town of children to murder their parents.  That's what I thought the movie was about, actually (instead of it being the first five minutes).  And the sequels that followed?  Well, I assumed they would be about people coming to investigate why no one in Gatlin returns phone calls or has paid their credit card bills.  Now, I don't know what to expect.<br /><br />Probably more corn.to expect.    Probably more corn.
1401207138|4.0|On one hand, this volume is beautifully bound. There aren't tons of extras, but there are enough to keep a devoted Moore fan satisfied (assuming the content contained herein hasn't been previously digested in another form). I can't tell that the presentation has been enhanced in any way, but it's printed on nice thick paper using vibrant inks.<br /><br />On the other hand, this is the Watchmen. Better folk than I have written whole books devoted to critical treatises of the work, so I will offer only this: Watchmen neophytes should be content with one of the cheaper volumes. They have the same story, and if you feel anything less than passionately about it, you will only have spent two week's allowance instead of two month's. Watchmen aficionados looking for bragging rights, the price is steep, but well worth it if your geeklings know the Watchmen name.
630469654X|4.0|As a kid in the 1980s I watched this film on TV. I remember loving the movie because it had an awesome battle with knights at the end and the Bishop was the bad guy (which at the time blew my mind because I was a by the book Catholic schoolboy).     I'll be honest, after Peter Jackson and others have re-invented the look and scale of the fantasy genre on film over the past ten years, Ladyhawke doesn't hold up as well as it did through my rose-colored glasses of nostalgia. If you've never seen the film before, you'll likely be sorely disappointed by the film's faults.     However, any fan of the 80s and/or fantasy films will likely overlook those same faults and should get a kick out of the awesomely cheesy 80s score by The Alan Parson's Project, Matthew Broderick's performance as basically Ferris Bueller in medieval France, Rutger Hauer as a lovelorn black knight out for revenge, and the unbelievably gorgeous Michelle Pfeiffer as the titular character.     Also, anyone with younger children into fantasy or castles and knights can feel safe sharing this film with their seven-year-old as the violence is minimal and not at all graphic.    As for the DVD itself--the disc is double sided (always a minus in my book) with both full & widescreen versions. The special features are minimal and a bit misleading. There are no deleted scenes or commentaries or making of featurettes. There are, however, TEXT descriptions of several aspects of the film, but who wants to read a DVD? If you buy LADYHAWKE, buy it for the memories or to make new memories with the young fantasy fan in your life.

B000053VAZ|5.0|I saw this movie years ago just after it came out.  It was one of those sleeper movies that didn't get much press.  I had to purchased it.. first on the VHS tapes and wore that out and had to buy it again on DVD. Had to have this classic in my movie collection. This film is so funny and will leave you with so many memorable memories that will stay with you for years to come. I recommed this movie to everyone who likes a good romatic comedy.  Great acting by all.  Enjoy......and laugh you hearts content.
B001EIOOV8|3.0|I purchased this item (Casino) along with another (Goodfellas).  Goodfellas worked fine on my Samsung player, and Casino couldn't get past the 'Play movie'!...The customer service at Amazon is Superior!  I had another 'Casino' blu ray video the next day!...It, too, did not work!...So I figured it might be my Samsung player...So, rather than purchase another blu-ray player, I purchased a Playstation 3 which has Blu-ray capabilities...Guess what...the Casino dvd worked with the Playstation 3...The bottom line...the Casino dvd will not work on some Blu-ray players!
B000F8O2PG|5.0|This season was thoroughly enjoyed by our family, and is now a valuable part of our collection.
B001ILHY2C|4.0|This review is for the 2009 version. I liked seeing the difference in the remake. Similar plot, but very different with updated special effects. Jason Statham is quite good and helps elevate the movie even if it is a B movie SciFi. Overall good action with plenty of what you would expect with this title. Good quality DVD with some replayability. If you enjoyed this catch [[ASIN:B000KHX73U Crank [Blu-ray]]].<br /><br />CA Luster
B0010YSD7M|5.0|I really enjoyed seeing how the Stargate team wrapped everything up in this movie.  It answers a lot of questions from where the series at season 10 left off.  It was awesome to see the Ori finally defeated too!  Don't forget to watch the Continuum movie after this one!  It too is very interesting, and features Richard Dean Anderson, as well as Don Davis.
B00127RAJY|5.0|I REALLY like this workout DVD.  Even though it's only 20 minutes, I really feel like I'm working out every part of my body.  There are 3 levels and each is a challenge.  I graduated from Level 1 to Level 2 after about 7 workouts, but still feel like I can do Level 1 and get results.  I haven't done Level 3 yet.  My only complaint is not being able to skip all of the early discussion to get to the main menu to start working out.  Turn on your DVD player, put in the DVD, then go get dressed and get your water.  It should be ready to go by then.  I also think the cool down is a bit lacking, but hey, if I'm trying to \\"get it done\\" in 20 minutes, what should I expect?
B000028U0Y|5.0|I can remember singing along with the album when I was quite young.  My Dad had an extensive Johnny Cash collection and this is the one I played more than any of the others.  When I was younger though, I didn't understand the fact that this was live inside a prison.  He played to the crowd masterfully, something very few performers of this day could pull off.  I play it several times a week right now, and it seems to get better with every listen.  Anyone that is a Johnny Cash fan should own this!
B00E9ZAT4Y|5.0|Great 50th edition with extras
0670019925|5.0|I am an American female who had never heard of David Lodge before stumbling upon this book on the lbrabry's new fiction shelf. After reading the opening paragraphs, I was hooked.  In addition to the skillfully drawn characters and insightful look at the world of the hearing impaired, the charm of \\"Deaf Sentence\\" is in its marvelous writing style. I savored the long, beautiful sentences and wry observations. And, although the characters were presented with all their warts and foibles, they were not caricatures, but fully rounded human beings portrayed with empathy.  I am going to purchase a copy of this book so I can savor it again and give it to my husband to read (if he ever gets any time for fiction).  What a delight to discover a new author who has written plenty of other books!

0385736002|2.0|I am fascinated with the legend of Nicholas Flamel ever since I read Harry Potter.  i thought this book will be more along the same lines. Perhaps I did not enjoy it much because I expected wizards in training and magical worlds with castles and a familiar wizard world.  This book is completely different. I was not familiar with the names of creatures and mosters.  The other worlds they Sophie and Josh Newman enter did not capture me.  I did read the 2nd book to see if it will be better but I could not get past the unfamiliar names and monsters that did not belong with my idea of Nicholas Flamel and his legend and wizardry.  There were too many elements together for MY taste.  Old British and some I never heard of.  I was looking for a book similar to Harry Potter and I cannot find one, maybe that is why i was disappointed.  I found this book more age appropriate for 8-10 years old, unlike Harry Potter.
0142000671|5.0|Again a very classic work by John Steinbeck.  This is a must read for everyone.  The story is real and draws you in.  It isn't a book that you will read and forget.<br /><br />I have enjoyed all the Steinbeck books that I have read, (Grapes of Wrath, East of Eden, The Pearl).  John Steinbeck's works are a must have for all bookshelves.<br /><br />I highly recommend this and all of Steinbeck's works.  Enjoy!

B001K3JF7K|1.0|Just plain boring.  Pure and simple.  I don't get it.  Diana Krall has so much to offer us musically.  Why isn't it coming across on her albums?  It is a snooze fest.    To me, it just sounds like she trys TOO hard to make it sound as though she is barely trying.  I would love to hear more piano playing...I love her piano playing.  She is so talented.  I don't get it.

B0021QGQ7M|5.0|[[ASIN:B0021QGQ7M Hex]]    Bryan Q. Miller delivers again with an in depth character study as well as, dare I say it, a entirely amusing episode . . . on purpose!  Fans were introduced to Zatanna Zatara, wonderfully portrayed by Serinda Swan.  Tom Welling and Erica Durance had dual roles.  Erica played Lois and Chloe (who takes on the appearance of Lois) and Tom played ever growing Clark and a Clark Kent who is a normal newspaperman without the responsibilities of super powers.  Great entertainment.  Great progression of characters.  Completely out of the ball park and heading for outer space.  This episode of SMALLVILLE was good television.  You'll think you are watching HOUSE or BONES.  SMALLVILLE should get hexed more often.
1416914307|5.0|I am still riding the roller coaster that is the Mortal Instruments. The ride has now slowed down to a halt. An ending like no other yet full of climax after climax and a whirlwind of emotions. I am left so emotionally charged that I do not know how I can pick up another book today. I need to let this sink in and absorb.<br /><br />Clary has been on such a ride. Since witnessing that murder back at Pandemonium to finding her mother missing, to the lover triangle, to family secrets revealed. In \\"City of Glass\\" her life comes full circle--well, everyone's lives do. Clary learns her true power and learns who she truly is at the end, much to our satisfaction. We learn that despite your upbringing you can still rise above it all and Jace proves that to us. He is one of the most complex characters in the book, fighting not only himself, but his inclinations and even his own family. He overcomes in great triumph and at the end you are touched by his expression of love and gratitude.<br /><br />The book is filled with so much emotion and passion I was left in awe and entranced by each and every word on the pages of this book. The characters have me rooting for them, and there's a lot to root for, trust me. The action--wow! I must say that I was on the edge of my seat plenty of times, gripped reading about the fighting and battles, whether physical or emotional.<br /><br />I'm not sure how to write about this book,really, since so much happens yet I cannot spoil anything. But rest assured that you will be sighing and crying, laughing and screaming. People die and people live. Love and loss. But most importantly \\"City of Glass\\" is a phenomenal ending to a world and characters we will dearly miss.

1416955070|4.0|\\"City of Bones\\" is the debut book of Cassandra Clare. In this fast paced whirlwind of a tale we met young Clary, a down to earth red head who goes on an adventure of her life. After witnessing a strange death at a local nightclub she is dragged into the mess that becomes her life. Problem is, she can't do anything about the death because she's the only one who can see the murders. After some close calls to her own life, Clary comes to know some secrets of her own. Her mom is missing, the killers are in fact Shadow hunters, they kill demons and Clary...well, Clary has to get some answers now. Clary has her own talents and skills, unbeknownst to her. She emerges from the shadows of ordinary Mundie life and learns about her true self. More importantly, she learns about her family and the secrets that lie beneath.<br /><br />City of Bones is a thrilling ride that has you sitting, waiting, and wishing. You are rooting for the characters as the battle an evil that hits close to home, so dangerous that you would rethink your family's dynamics.<br /><br />The characters are full of life, and although we might have a few things figured out before them they are still a joy to read about. A story full of secrets and hidden agendas is bound to hold you, captivating your imagination. Not to mention the complex and utterly fantastical world Cassandra Clare has created. I find it completely fascinating and just couldn't get enough!!!
B000E1YVZU|5.0|Unfortunately, I have not been able to see the show on stage...which I'm really upset about. But what some people don't realize is that we can't ALL get to the theater. I know I can't. I'm 15 and every time I begged my parents to take me, neither of them were willing to drive into NYC. Now, it has closed, but there's still the tour. All I can do is sit back and enjoy what I can and I absolutely LOVE this film. It's great! The 2nd disc offers a great documentary on Jonathan Larson and the history behind RENT as well as some deleted scenes (some of which I would like to have seen in the final cut). Steering away from my babbling, I just got to say, LA VIE BOHEME! You won't be disappointed!
B001K3JF7K|2.0|Krall's first few CD's of \\"cover\\" songs were great. She had a huge repository of standards to record. \\"Fly me to the Moon\\", \\"Unforgettable,\\" etc..  - classics all. After 4-5 cd's of that she released the \\"girl in the other room\\" which was IMHO her best CD to date, all new original songs that really showcased her talent. An exceptional cd in so many ways.    This CD however, draws from the leftovers of the \\"covers\\" that made her famous. To me its uninspiring lounge music at best, \\"walk on by\\" for example isn't even a jazz tune. Nothing to recommend about this CD unfortunately.    Sorry Diana, please treat us to more of yours and Elvis' original material. Its amazing.
B001R7IHA0|5.0|Keith does it again! Another great album, every song sounds like a hit. How does he manage to do this with every album? It's rare to find an artist who can do this. Most albums only have a few good songs, but with Keith's albums every song is either good or great. Can't wait to see him in concert May 15 in Chicago!
1584233494|5.0|This book is amazing, it's a totally comprehensive look at a great artist's work, starting from a humble sticker campaign to national recognition, and even a stab at the presidential campaign field.    the images are printed very clearly, awesome quality book overall. Great text, very insightful and an awesome read.
031606792X|5.0|I am a student from Victoria Morse's class.If you like vampires vs. werewolves, this is obviously the book for you.This story takes place in Forks,Washington.The main character's name is Bella Swan.Her big problem is that the Volturi don't want her having a baby that's half mortal and half immortal.What's so awesome about this book is that you can connect to some of the characters and it's a great love story.This book is so intresting that it kept me reading all night till 1 A.M.
B000002AP1|3.0|The original mix is the one I prefer.  This is too much like rewriting history as far as I'm concerned.  I don't think RAW POWER was ever issued to cd properly in the first place.  I seem to remember that Sony edited out Ig's beltch on the previous and only other reissue that I know of.  Whose idea was that?    Someone said to get the original vinyl and I'd have to agree with that assesment if you have a turntable.  What they should have done here was issue this as a double cd with Iggy's mix for those who want to hear it along with the unrevised original Bowie mix.
B000T2PRF2|5.0|This is jazz and Blues at it's best, Done by a young artist from Canada who will just make you stop and want more. In fact I am anxious to receive her newest CD due to be released any day.<br />  If you love to her really great keyboards, Diana does have them for you, She is perfect once she touches those keys she makes them sound so smooth.<br /> Then throw in her voice, She is primo.<br /> I have every CD she has made and have not had a bad one yet.<br />  Ironically she is married to Rocker Elvis Costello but he has had no effect on changing the incredible music she writes and produces in many cases, This music is Jazz and Blues and nothing else.<br /> Buy her you won't regret it
B001QB9H10|1.0|So bad. So very bad. Part 2 was enough to stretch the limits of believability. Remember the car flying sequence? This one is poorly done, period.

Come on Jason, did you need the money that badly?
B000G8NY4U|5.0|So there I was back in August of 2006 flipping through the channels at 2 in the morning and then I see Yanni directing his very talented band.  I never was a Yanni fan before.  But I knew who he was and even listened to some of his music before but didn't pay any attention.  Until NOW.  All I have to say is that I stayed up and watched the whole thing.  It wasn't until I heard Pedro Eustache playing one of Yanni's compositions 'Enchantment' that I became a hardcore Yanni fan.  Gave me goosebumps.  Amazing.  Then I went out and bought all of Yanni's albums. Can't get enough.  If you are or not a fan of Yanni GET THIS ONE.  You will NOT be disappointed.  But watch out.  You may get hooked and buy  all of his albums.    Music is well said to be the speech of angels. ~ Thomas Carlyle
1406309346|2.0|I probably should have looked at the age group for this book, but my daughter is running out of books for two year-olds and mostly enjoys preschool books anyway.  This book scared her so badly, her eyes welled up with tears by about the third or fourth page.    Make no mistake about it--this book is SCARY. It has been called a book to reassure little ones that Mama always comes back, but the majority of the book is spent with three babies in terror over the loss of their mother. The illustrations show the intensity of fear these three tiny creatures have. I felt just awful frightening my toddler before bed and ended up bringing her to be with me until she was sound asleep. That was only the second time in her little life she's slept with me; that's how seriously I took her reaction to this book.    Perhaps for an older child, the book is worthwhile, but by 4 or 5, I think most children are too old for the easy wording. This book, then, is not the best choice when there are so many other great ones to be had.
B001K3JF7K|1.0|It seems that Diana is determined to keep hurting us jazz lovers. Is she after the money or the fame or both? My grandmother only listens to Liberace and James Last but Diana managed to get through her door with her previous album. I'm sure she'll do it again with Quiet Nights. Could this be what Diana Krall is really after? To be a star in the eyes of people who love musac, like my own grandma?   So if you want to listen to great mellow jazz that is NOT elevator music, do yourself a favor and buy a copy of 'John Coltrane & Johnny Hartman' instead. [[ASIN:B000003N7K ]]
B000CRJOJO|4.0|Most Chris Rea albums are good.  Some do not touch you in the same way as others but most are good.  This variation to the usual \\"The Road to Hell\\" is terrific.  I had not seen this one before and decided to buy it depite the fact that I had the other album (ten tracks).  For mine this was one of the best buys I have made in the past six months.  Fantastic music.

B0002EQ7E2|5.0|This CD makes me so happy.  Put it on when you have chores to do and before you know it they are done and you're still dancing around the house.  I love the extra cuts of \\"Diamonds on the Soles\\"....  A great value for all the music you get.
B000001IQH|5.0|This album is a great mix of sounds.  Not all true Rancid fans love this album but I certainly do.
0061438294|5.0|This book has been great.  It gives great insight in Neurolinguistics.  I would recommend to anyone in law enforcement or who works directly with large numbers of people.
B001FSDOZO|5.0|The copy of Dark Horse that I have just purchased at Amazon is my fourth copy of this album. I just can not get enough of it, listen to it in the car, in the kitchen, in the living room - so that is the reason why I need so many copies. I really love Dark Horse, I get a feeling of magic when I listen to it. Hard to explain.  Is it possible to rate it with more than 5 stars????
B000WGNLLW|5.0|I enjoy listening to all the songs. A different Duran Duran style of music which suits in todays music industry. I just have to say one thing, Duran Duran is the greatest whatever music they create, THE BEST!!!!!!!!!
B001K3JF7K|2.0|I was looking forward to this new album since early January.  The songs seemed to fit her perfectly.  But what happenned?  She sounds like a 75 year old woman with a bad cold.  This new breathless style she has developed you either like it or just say huh!  I was hoping she would have gone back to her soft but straitforward syle like Live in Paris or Love Scenes that you can play over and over.  I will play this every now and then but it is far from my favorite of hers.
039472903X|5.0|If you have to persuade people with an ad this book is a must read. The information is a little dated but the premises of the ads are explained in a way that you can understand them. This book goes hand in hand with Confessions of an ad man. Some of the information will be repeated but it is all of the good stuff that should be reinforced. You will either want to take notes or write in the book when you come up with some new ideas. There is a bunch of information packed in the pages of this book.
B001FBSMF8|1.0|I love Chris Cornell's voice.  I've loved his solo work, as well as Soundgarden and Audioslave.  This is a train wreck.  You can't even hear his voice on most of the tracks.  If I had wanted to listen to a Brittany Spears CD, I would have bought one.  There is one track that is excellent (2 drinks away from crying) and everything else is a waste.  Buy that 1, and save the rest of your cash.
0452286751|5.0|The book is one that should not be missed by any reader. however, the amazon product does not match the photograph presented. It is a hardcover edition but the paper that wraps the cover is brown and simple and not appealing at all. For me this mattered only because the book is a gift and i expected something else. but, the book is still excellent and worth reading
1400079179|5.0|People care about religion, and it became as a part of people's life. Some people believe in religion, while some others don't. I, as the one who has no belief on the religion, highly recommend \\"The Da Vinci Code\\" by Dan Brown to you.<br />  Langdon, who is the main character of this book, has this massive knowledge toward religion. With his parter; Sophie, Langdon and Sophie keep finding significant evidences that says there is no god. I am not going to tell any details about the story. However the way story goes is pretty intense and makes readers to read more and more. The evidences and facts that are showed on the book are so shocking and fresh. Some people might say Dan Brown is making lies on his book, but after I read the book page by page, I totally into this book and became the one who believe whatever the book says. Although I am not really sure whether the evidences on the book are true or not, I could forgive it, since it is only a novel. Dan Brown tells these intense and exciting quests with massive amount of information. Information and evidences that Dan Brown shows on his book; \\"The Da Vinci Code\\" can be boring, because they are too much. However by showing exciting and intense happening, he shows what he wants to say. This book; \\"The Da Vinci Code\\" by Dan Brown is full of shock, that I was even worry about Christians. Dan Brown shows these strong evidences and facts, and saying that there is no god. Dan Brown is actually challenging toward the whole group who believes in god. Funny thing is Dan Brown's evidences do make sense, and that means people believe in the made-thing.  This book; \\"The Da Vinci Code\\" by Dan Brown was pretty a shock for me. I didn't believe in god, means I do believe there is no omniscient thing, however I couldn't find a way to prove that there is no god. Also there was no one who can actually be against most of people. Still people, who believe in god, would say Dan Brown is making up lies, but I do recommend those people to read this book again closely. \\"The Da Vinci Code\\" by Dan Brown is a novel obviously, but Dan Brown tells us specific evidences in his book. Although \\"The Da Vinci Code\\" would be in a novel section of the book store, it means even a lot more than the one in history section.o read this book again closely. \\"The Da Vinci Code\\" by Dan Brown is a novel obviously, but Dan Brown tells us specific evidences in his book. Although \\"The Da Vinci Code\\" would be in a novel section of the book store, it means even a lot more than the one in history section.
0385340567|2.0|Child writes this with his usual intensity, and the book is hard to put down through at least the first half.  At some point though, it becomes more about politics and shades of grey than a black-and-white good vs. evil conflict that marks most Reacher novels.  It contains a lot of liberal and anti-Christian trope, and that has no place in a Jack Reacher novel.  At that point you end up just wanting to finish it for the sake of finishing.    I've read all the Reacher books as they've been released and am a faithful fan.  Another one like this will give me real pause before buying more though.  If you're not hooked and don't buy into the \\"have to read all of the series\\" idea, then pass this by.
B000TEUSJK|4.0|This movie has elements that are astonishing, but it also has an inordinate amount of sex and gore. Remember, Bob Guccione made the film. The thing is, it actually portrays life as it probably was back then. Life was brutal and fleeting, which is really brought out here. Malcom MacDowell is amazing as Caligula, and Helen Mirrin is fantastic as well. If you cannot watch violence easily, this is not the film for you, but if you want an idea of what life in ancient Rome was like, get this film.
B00123IB32|5.0|This is a great cd if you are in the mood to listen to some great Irish music, it turns any day into st. patrick's day, and makes the guinness taste that much better!
B001R4MEYS|5.0|I think the last time I heard something so refreshing was when I heard Tool's Aenima in the fall of 96, and that's saying a lot. This album is so good it's almost sickening. The Last Baron is a masterpiece. Oblivion will be song of the year. Enough said.
B000O8OTNC|5.0|Are there \\"better\\" sharpeners on the market? Probubly. But as an all around sharpener (I have several styles by several different manufacturers) this little gem is hands down THE BEST! Otherwise I would not have spent a week tracking this one down on the internet after all my local suppliers were \\"out of stock\\" or had moved on to more expensive less useful models. The thing folds up and goes in my pocket, it also has a handy hole for a lanyard which my new one is on. It does a great job on my chefs knives, my hunting knife and my serrated kives as well. It's easy for my big fingers to hold on to and steady on the edge of the counter when I am sharpening. I bought an extra one to put away in case this one gets \\"lost\\" or I give mine away to a friend. (In case you can't tell I really like it and would buy another one in a minute flat!)
B001DDBCUK|2.0|I really enjoyed the series and thought I might like this movie.  I was wrong.  I was so bad that I don't even like to watch the series anymore.
B00005OAA6|5.0|THIS CD IS VERY GOOD I LOOK UP 2 POSH SPICE I SAY SHE IS A ROLE MODEL FOR ANYONE I LOVE EMMA BUNTON AND MEL B AND GER I HALLIWELL MEL C'S SOLO ALUBMS FOR NOT SO GOOD BUT OKAY I LOVE THIS CD IT IS VERY GOOD A GREAT BUY FOR ANY POSH SPICE FAN
B000RPTQ1C|3.0|IF you're like me, just-above-average joe music listener, there are 3-4 really good songs you'll want to play again and again and several you won't care to listen to again.  Pick and choose the songs you want rather than going for the whole album on this one.  That's my two cents.
B000FIMG68|5.0|After watching Lost on TV when it first aired and then watching it at home on DVD, I'm still as confused about the show as I originally was.  It is the most mysterious entertainment I have ever watched.  Hopefully, I will be able to decypher some of the mystery in future viewings.
B000PFU7OO|5.0|This is easily one of my favorite albums. It is both beautiful and catchy. And captures lots of different styles. A great buy.
B000MRAAJW|1.0|I purchased two copies of this from Amazon and wound up returning them both.  In both cases disk 4 would not play in my HD-DVD player, the only disks so far to fail.  I gave up and purchased it on Blu-Ray from eBay.  The program itself is wonderful, but I'd be leery of it in HD-DVD.
B001PPGAIA|3.0|Move has two many plots.  too long.  should have been a mini series
B000VDDWDS|4.0|Everything about this BluRay is excellant.  Everything about the movie is excellent, great cinematography, great script, great editing, great acting and great sound in DTS MasterHD.  My only complaint is that at approx 17:20 into the film, there is a digital hit in the audio that is earthshattering.  I have gone through 2 discs from Amazon some months ago, a disc a while leter from Best Buys and now with my latest order received last week, I still find the same problem in the exact same place on the disc.  I'm torn in terms of keeping the disc and turnign the volume down every time I play it or returning it once again.  Anyone else experience the same problem.  In terms of Blu Ray, I have been pleased with most discs I have purchased or rented, but I have to tell you, this re-occuring problem with DTS Master HD audio has occured on other discs.  I know it isn't a problem with my equipment because with each disc, the problem is repeatable in exactly the same place every time.  Someday, Blu Ray will actually fulfill it's promise!  I can hardly wait.
0385486804|5.0|I read this book in one sitting.  I was glued to every page and could not put it down.  The movie isn't near as good as the book.
1400064287|5.0|This is an excellent outline on how you can communicate an idea (anyone's idea, not necessarily yours) effectively. The Heath brothers credit Malcolm Gladwell for \\"The Stickiness Factor\\" element that drives the book and it certainly reads like an offshot/complement to \\"The Tipping Point.\\" (As a matter of fact, I'd say its breakdown demonstrates why Gladwell is such a great writer.)    The book itself follows its own guidelines by giving concise and credible stories throughout its chapters. It's a fairly easy read and the clinics included in some of the chapters help to solidify the ideas they present.
B001GM28HO|5.0|Great.  I love to dance.  I dont often buy cd.  I love the entire cd and it keep you dancing from beginning to the end.
1591841992|3.0|The Back of the Napkin had a great impact on the way I think and solve problems.  In fact the only two business books I can say had more of an impact on my thoughts and actions are \\"How to Make Friends and Influence People\\" and \\"Made to Stick\\".  So why only three stars?<br /><br />The execution of the book leaves a lot to be desired.  Most of the influence this book had on me wasn't actually reading it, but watching all the fantastic videos that explain the concepts on [..].  It's not too often the promotion of a book can have much more impact than the book itself.  I have implemented many of the concepts and couldn't be happier, but here are some issues with the book:<br /><br />- Too small - if you are going to focus a topic around pictures they need to be bigger than tiny thumbnails - terrible usability.<br />- Illustrations that actually make understanding more difficult.  The best example is the authors use of pictures of hands with fingers to represent simple number like 3.  3 is significantly easier to recognize than a drawing of fingers.<br />- Terrible acronyms.  If you are going to use an acronym throughout the book it should be somewhat easy to remember or at least read. SQVID might be one of the most discordant acronyms I've ever seen, and I laughed out loud when I saw that S stood for simple and D stood for Delta (change).  Really SQVID is about as useless of acronym as possible.  There is nothing that makes it \\"stick\\" and there sure isn't anything simple about SQVID.<br /><br />It is still well worth the read, but I hope the author will try to make some of these ideas a little more \\"sticky\\" in the next edition.  In the meantime visit his website and watch everything on there - it will definitely stick better.
B0013ND30W|5.0|Grandchildren are wonderful, they allow people to relive their childhood memories and Sleeping Beauty, all fixed up, is a great way to remember!
1595141979|5.0|Wow.  This was by far the best book of the series, yet.  I am in love with Dimitri!  I'm not going to give anything away, but by the time I was done with this book, I merely went into depression! Haha, JK, but it was really upsetting.  I can't believe I made the mistake of starting this series before all the books were published because now I have to wait till August to find out what happens! =/  A little word of advice to those who haven't read these books, READ SLOW! lol.  These are absolutely amazing books. =)

B0015ABRE2|5.0|I don't write many reviews but this show is so fantastic i had to take a few minutes to describe my admiration for the most suspenseful, compelling drama in many moons.  I have watched all 36 episodes to date and i find that the scripts for every episode are first rate and the acting by everyone is top notch.  Michael C. Hall has absorbed himself into the character of Dexter - a  most likable serial killer - that's right - a \\"likable serial killer\\" who has been tortured since childhood by witnessing his mother's murder, ever since that day some 35 years earlier Dexter has been transformed by this event and finds himself turning into a killer himself, he has his own \\"code\\" that he kills by - only the murderers of the innocent will feel Dexter's blade of justice and only at the moment of truth does Dexter feel that rush of adrenaline come over him - a rush he needs quite frequently.  Dexter's day job comes in handy also as he works for the Miami Police in their forensics unit as a blood spatter analyst - a job which gives him all the access he needs to find his next killer to murder.  This show may not be for the squeamish as homicide scenes are routine and violence is just around the corner but if you want to watch a \\"killer\\" show - this is it!
006112429X|5.0|My first confession is that for the first one hundred pages I just couldn't understand what all the fuss was about with this book. I found the narrator annoying and the story slow. But a friend urged me to press on and dutifully I did... can I just say that was the best advice I have ever received. This book is amazing!! (Notice the exclamation marks, I hate them myself but nothing else seems to show how good this book is.) I'm sure that in a hundred years time this book will still be heralded as a classic. Shriver takes that all too familiar story of an American High School shooting and does something brave and horrifying with it. I don't want to give anything away but suffice it to say you think you know what happened on that day Kevin went to school but nothing will prepare you for Shriver's revelations. I was left physically reeling.<br /><br />Told in epistolary form Kevin's mother Eva speaks of that tragic day and Kevin's childhood. All the letters are addressed to her husband Franklin, and his absence is a haunting forewarning of what is to come. Although Eva will draw you in, and as a reader I was swept along by her narration, there are a few suitable moments when you can't help thinking `is this the whole story?' `Did it really happen that way?' Shriver is a master of suspense, dropping in clues and hints about the past and the future. Kevin's very presence shimmers off the page in all his nasty glory, but for all that he is still just a young boy. Is that any excuse? The genius of this book is that it leaves so many questions. Very rarely does a book stay with me as long as I feel this one will. In fact if I close my eyes and think about that day at the school I can see it all as if I was actually there. Horrifying but totally compelling.<br /><br />Other books I would recommend:<br />[[ASIN:1849230943 The Separate Principle]]
B00003CXCQ|1.0|Let me tell everyone.  All of the movies that are not being made anymore are now selling as PIRATED COPIES!!  You cannot get an original Lion King, Snow White, Little Mermaid, Aladdin, Beauty and the Beast.....    The sellers will tell you that they are original and factory sealed.  But just check for the SECURITY SEAL.  It is GONE!!  There is no security seal on any of these.  And the \\"paperwork\\" is all copied.  The video quality is very poor.  The originals are put into \\"flip page\\" cases, but the copies have the DVDs on the sides of the case, facing each other.    THESE ARE PIRATED COPIES AND SOME OF THESE SELLERS DON'T EVEN KNOW IT.  That's what makes it harder to report them.  They are genuinely nice people and didn't mean to sell a copy.  They really think it's an original.  So, NO, I haven't reported anyone...just letting everyone know through this review.
0307346617|5.0|A wonderful combination of world politics, psychology, military theory, and of course, zombies!!! Unlike anything else I have read, and a wonderfully entertaining book. The only disappointment during the read was when it ended!
B001PKVG5C|3.0|Well, one way of looking at it is that it IS Diana Krall.   This isn't to say that this new CD isn't enjoyable because it is.  Unfortunately, in my opinion, it is not her best, or even close to it.  But I've got to say that I was so looking forward to Diana doing an entire CD of bossa nova and that this is somewhat disappointing.    The choice of songs is wonderful and I was really anticipating what I'd hear.  Unfortunately, the \\"breathless\\" singing style doesn't do her any favors.  As a previous reviewer said, I guess it's just a matter of personal taste.  Just think of how much better each of these songs would have sounded if they were performed in her normal sultry and smoky voice.      My personal opinion is that Diana's talent is better displayed with her quartet and not with an orchestra behind her.  The lady is a very talented piano player and Anthony Wilson is an amazing jazz guitarist.  Neither are featured here.      Is it just petty to point out to previous reviewer that \\"Este Seu Olhar\\" is Portuguese, not Spanish?
0393325172|5.0|Because of Patrick O'Brian's superior story-telling skills, I enjoyed every page of this book, even when the author used nautical terms I did not understand.<br /><br />Patrick O'Brian's scholarship is evident throughout the book. He uses primary sources for his battle scenes, although he states that he has been flexible with chronology and ship names, the jaw-dropping battles he describes actually took place. As he writes in his Author's Notes, \\"When one is writing about the Royal Navy of the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries it is difficult to avoid understatement; it is difficult to do justice to one's subject; for so very often the improbable reality outruns fiction....That is why I have gone straight to the source for the fighting in this book.\\"<br /><br />The author reveals his main characters, Captain Jack Aubrey and physician Stephen Maturin, slowly. As individuals they are compelling and their relationship is engrossing. Master and Commander starts with Jack Aubrey listening to a classical recital during which he has a confrontation with his future friend. Shortly after the concert he becomes Master and Commander of his Majesty's Sloop Sophie. The heart of the book is the adventures Aubrey and Maturin have aboard this sloop. However, the author skillfully integrates their personal lives away from the Sophie, and this exponentially increases the fascination of the story.<br /><br />Finally, the author effectively uses a film technique that was common in the thirties and forties, that is, he quickly skips large periods of time, sometimes even between paragraphs. However, this practice not only doesn't interfere with the reader's enjoyment, it enhances it by moving the adventure along in unexpected ways.<br /><br />I have read the entire Horatio Hornblower series by C.F. Forester, which deals with roughly the same time period in England's navel history. They were outstanding books, but the character development in Master and Commander is superior. Aubrey has many more character flaws than Forester's Hornblower, and is more nuanced and interesting.<br /><br />If you want to read wonderful stories about this period in British navel history, I would recommend starting with the Hornblower series and then reading the Aubrey/Maturin collection, starting with Master and Commander.<br /><br />PS I recently finished the second volume in the series, Post Captain, and the story just gets better and better.than Forester's Hornblower, and is more nuanced and interesting.    If you want to read wonderful stories about this period in British navel history, I would recommend starting with the Hornblower series and then reading the Aubrey/Maturin collection, starting with Master and Commander.

B0018AK9RA|2.0|DON'T HAVE MUCH GOOD THINGS TO SAY ABOUT THIS ALBUM. HOPEFULLY THE LAST OF IT'S KIND, LETS GET BACK TO BONE CRUNCHING METAL PLEASE!!!
0802130208|5.0|\\"A confederacy of Dunces\\" is the funniest book I have ever read. It had me in full belly laughs, almost near tears at times. So why am I so sad after reading it? I guess it largely has to do with the story of the author, John Kennedy Toole. A common attack on this book - indeed the original attack which caused its initial rejection - is that it \\"isn't about anything.\\" But when viewed within the context of Toole's life and death, the book gains enormous meaning.<br /><br />I think that there is more than just a little of John Kenndy Toole in the character of Ignatius J. Reilly. Ignatius ranks up there with the greatest literary characters in history. He is vivid, bright, alive, and unique. His motivations are complex, and he constantly lies to himself, and therefore to the reader. On the surface, he appears incredibly obtuse and dense (and he is!) but yet other times, notably when he needs to save his own rear, he is incredibly cunning and insightful. One my favorite moments in the book is when, after days on end of lazily and aimlessly pushing his cart about, eating more hot dogs then he sells and being rude to just about everybody he meets, he has a pressing need for some money. Suddenly, he knows exactly where to go to find some business, and almost immediately sells all of his hot dogs: \\"Calling, entreating, he guided the wagon into the crowd of men and succeeded in selling all of his hot dogs, courteously and effusively squirting ketchup and mustard on his sold goods with all the energy of a fireman.\\"<br /><br />What many people don't understand is that Ignatius rejects society because society rejects him. An overly intelligent, unattractive, overweight, poor, fatherless boy - was he the most popular kid in high school? More like least popular. So he has taken this rejection and chosen to wear it like a shroud. It is his protection. If a society that he utterly condemns and despises rejects him, so what? But we all know that deep in his heart, there is pain.<br /><br />So there is just one level of your meaning! This book is most certainly not \\"about nothing.\\" But as John Kennedy Toole learned the hard way, not everyone is capable of \\"getting\\" it. And that is what breaks my heart most of all. That this man poured his soul into what truly is a comedic masterpiece, only to have it rejected, like I imagine he had been rejected his entire life. \\"A Confederacy of Dunces\\" deserves every bit of praise it has received.one level of your meaning!

0312360266|5.0|I ordered this book and got it very quickly. It is a great book and I ordered the other books in the series right away. Thank you Amazon.com for being there for me. I live quite far from a store that carries great books, so I am quite a fan of Amazon.com. Thanks again.<br /><br />  michelle_wangerin@yahoo.com
B000VNMMQG|5.0|I have enjoyed watching this dvd over and over again and have bought this time for a family member who loves it too.  Great service and as always, will buy again from Amazon and this seller.  Keep up the great service and even greater prices!
B000F8O35U|1.0|I just rented this movie for my four year old.<br />I could not believe how--scary is not a strong enough word--demonic?? and horrific the villain is in this movie. Ursula is a cruel, lecherous freak. And it's supposed to be ok for my kid to watch???<br /><br />Also, I don't like the message that happy endings come when we chase after some guy who looks good, leave everything for him, and gee, well, everything will be fine, right????<br /><br />Ugh.  I hate this movie. Its only saving grace is the crab.
B001MYIXAC|5.0|Im a mega horror fanatic and im real hard on the horror movies that have come out recently that even have the adacity to call themselves horror but i must say this movie had my mouth to the floor.  I was completely thrown for a loop.  I threw it in my online rentals from blockbuster just because it got 4 stars from amazon because i have seen almost everything out there.  From the title and the preview i had no idea this was a vampire movie it was done so i want to say discretly almost as though the writers didnt want to blow the surprise hahaha.  It took me till well off into the middle of the movie before i relized it was a vampire movie and it was like someone shook me and woke me up like kaduh! hahahah I loved it!  I loved the fact that they used alittle girl and a little boy and showed the movie through their eyes instead of an adults because thats how we see most movies through the eyes of an adult.  I love the whole emtional side to the movie.  That even though the little girl who wasnt even a girl but she cared for this boy Oskar and he cared for her.  They protected and looked out for each other.  Oskar didnt seem to care what she was or what she did his love was uncondiotional and most kids are that way.  I can go on and on about the movie but i wont ill leave some things for other viewers to talk about.  I have to give the writers, directors, and actors a big thumbs up because i havent seen a movie like this in a long time.  I think im going to actually buy this one instead of waiting until they have a few previously viewed at a better price.  This one is worth it!
B00008NG5V|5.0|I love Jack Johnson! I have all of his cd's but this one is my favorite one! I especially like \\"times like these\\" and \\"taylor\\"    This is definitely a cd you'll want to listen to over and over again!
B00005B1W5|5.0|Yanni is by far, one of the greatest musical artists of all times.  His natural talent and development of a unique style of music is refreshing to listen to and his concerts are world class.  I never get tired of listening to his music and watching his concets on DVD.  They are soothing for relaxing at the end of a stressful day.
B001GDUC4E|5.0|I didn't like Camp Rock, even though I'm a JoBro fan.  One thing I did like was that Demi Lovato can actually sing! And her debut album doesn't disappoint.  I love every song.  She has the perfect balance of upbeat, catchy songs with ballads.  It's a rare album where every song is amazing.  Bottom line: this girl puts Miley to shame, and makes those HSM stars look like a joke! So if her Disney status is holding you back, just know that this girl is a true artist, and this is an amazing album!
B001194F5K|5.0|One of the most informative books regarding the Afghanistan people and the horrors of the Taliban Rule. It was beautiful, moving, and educational. It should be required reading for every high school social studies class and anyone entering the military with possiblity of going to Afghanistan. This will help them understand more about the Taliban, and respect the Afghanistan people.
B001DJLCRC|5.0|This is an absolutely compelling series; currently being televised on AMC (American Movie Classics) as an original series on Sunday at 10:00pm. I bought this DVD set on the recommendation from a friend and I was hooked by the storyline, excellent script, dialogue and supporting cast.<br /><br />This is the best series that I have watched since Six Feet Under and Dexter. This series and the aforementioned detail why cable and premium channels are so relevant to viewers.
B0015DYIH2|5.0|I love this book! It is easily my favorite book in the Twilight saga. If you have read the other 3 books I don't think there is any way for you not to read this one!
0312360266|2.0|With \\"Marked\\" PC Cast and her daughter Kristin Cast give us yet another troubled outcast girl marked as different, with a strange affinity for all things vampire (or vampyre, as it were). We have heard this story before. However the manner of the singling out is decidely unique. Call it a cross between Harry Potter and Twilight. Loser girl goes to vampire boarding school where she finds out she's actually really special and powerful... I would say this book, while not being the most inventive or original, does have merit. It offers something to the more mature female reader; someone young enough to really enjoy Twilight, but old enough to want more sex in her reading material. The Cast women have the teen angst and internal self-editing right on, even if it does turn into a rather annoying device after a while. And although I would categorize this book generally as fluff, I find myself intrigued about the next segment of Zoey Redbird's journey. I hazard to guess that \\"Marked\\" has a small but steady audience. And, while being unable to put a finger on why I want to read \\"Betrayed\\", I may just go get it from the library (not a book I need to own, however).

B000002OX5|5.0|Before \\"Progressive Rock\\" there was Pop music and Pop art. The Who`s concept album of sorts, \\"Sell Out\\" takes the best of Mod a-go-go dance rock and marries it to the heavier psychedelic (backwards guitar, feedback and distortion) sound which was becoming increasingly popular in 1967. The result is sheer delight to Who fans and rock aficionados in general. In doing so The Who take a light handed, tongue in cheek, approach and never lose their sense of humor. Probably one of The Who's more underrated efforts (Sell Out was recorded and released a while before the Who achieved international fame and produced the heavy themed concept albums \\"Tommy\\" and \\"Quadrophenia\\") and unlike those later efforts plays more like a string of gold nuggets interlaced with some clever AM radio jingles. If you like well crafted rock and roll songs complete with great harmonies, hooks and  Pete Townsend feedback this is for you. One last note - Why did MCA, who distribute The Who's catalog of music - wait until the mid 90's to include the extra tracks? In my opinion the bonus cuts sound like they always belong to this album and are well worth upgrading the old CD from the 80s (like I did) or being pleasantly surprised if you're not familiar with  this release to begin with!
B001R7IHA0|5.0|I listened to this CD for the first time, and I just really enjoyed it.  All the songs are fresh and new but sound so natural because they are Keith urban music, sound, and rhythm.  Some artists' CD sounds so different from one another, but I think all Keith Urban CDs have some trusted style - Keith Urban style.    Then, I listened to this CD over and over, and some of the songs are getting my new favorites, not only Sweet Thing, but also \\"I'm In\\", and \\"Kiss a girl\\", etc.  I think this CD is refreshing, relaxing, heart warming to me. I will keep listening to it for many more times and am not sure whether I will ever get board.    Thank you for reading my comment and sorry for my bad English, I am a Japanese living in Tokyo. I thought I am so unlucky because Keith Urban concert never hit here.  But lucky this time, because of the time zone I was able to listen to this new album a day before those who live in the States :-)
B001ED7C58|2.0|I love the Twilight books and have seen the movie several times, but my favorite tracks from the movie have not been included in the soundtrack. This is a disappointment. Robert Pattinson's hauntingly beautiful \\"Let Me Sign,\\" which accompanied Bella's death scene, and Radio Head's rhythmically complex Grammy-winning \\"15 Step,\\" which played at the start of the ending credits, were left out. Also, it would have been nice to include a little of Debussy's Claire de Lune and a simple, unorchestrated version of Bella's Lullaby. Bella and Edward's love story is one of the most romantic things I've ever read and appeals to romantics of any age. This soundtrack seems to have been geared to the under 20 demographic. But even this demographic would probably appreciate a more inclusive soundtrack.
B001DJ7PR8|2.0|I had heard many good things about Vicky Cristina Barcelona, that it was Woody Allen's best film in a long time. I also looked forward to seeing more of Rebecca Hall, who was outstanding in Frost/Nixon.    Sadly, the film is very disappointing. The premise is somewhat ridiculous, with two American women in Barcelona being crudely propositioned at a restaurant by a moody Spanish painter with a \\"past.\\" Soon they're in a private jet with him for a little interlude in a quiet town.    The character Cristina (Scarlett Johannson) is a scatterbrained neurotic who will sleep with anyone who gives her attention, so it's plausible she would fall for the Spaniard's tired line. But it's absolutely incredible that the level-headed, and engaged, Vicky (Hall) would hit the mattress with him. Is Vicky so bored by her one-dimensional husband-to-be that she'll bed a total stranger? Is this a \\"what happens in Barcelona stays in Barcelona\\" scenario?    As to Penelope Cruz's performance as the painter's estranged and suicidal-homicidal wife, it's OK, but it's nowhere near the stellar acting of Amy Adams or Viola Davis of Doubt. Both ladies were robbed at Oscar time this year.
0810970686|5.0|My children enjoy reading this book.  My eldest daughter keeps re-reading the books over and over again because according to them the book is just fun to read.
B000NA28HU|2.0|Since I liked the books, and since I knew from Lord of the Rings and Harry Potter that fantasy books can be made into great movies, I decided to give Eragon the Movie a try.  I learned something very important from this movie: Stefan Fangmeir shouldn't be directing anything more serious that traffic on a deserted country road. He and the rest of the loonies who made this abomination are obviously either very stupid, or they forget to read the source material before they made a movie out of it.  I'll get to the most obvious gripe first. This movie was not true to the book at all. In fact, I could probably name at least 50 things that were dramatically changed from book to movie. I saw a chart online that describes at least that many, and maybe as many as twice the number. I'm not just talking about a few minor plot details: the rules of magic have been altered quite a bit, and none of the characters even remotely resemble how the characters were described in the books. They made no effort to follow the book, so it's basically its own story.  Even considered on its own merits, it still is just a light and hastily scrapped together film for the kids at best. The acting is rather bad at times, the script is horrendous, the run time is way too short, the protagonist is even more snobby and annoying than in the books, there's little to like, etcetera.  As icing on the cake of Stefan F.'s disgrace, the movie is also very derivative of Star Wars and Lord of the Rings. Granted, the book had several similarites, but the movie takes it to new heights. In fact, there are times when it seems the makers went out of their way to make the movie more similar to Star Wars! For example, early in the movie, there's a scene where the main character stares up at the sun in the evening while somber music plays. It wasn't in the book, it was in A New Hope, why is it here? Also, an important point of the plot was changed in which the Wise Old Mentor was killed by the Imperial General, whenhe was actually killed by the Ra'zac in the books. This switch was entirely unnecessary and only reinforced the Vader vs. Obi-wan parallel.  What's worst about the film, though, is that it just feels like the shreds of a larger story clumsily patched together. The film just wasn't long enough to tell the story they were trying to tell, even if it had been more true to the book. Some of the deleted scenes in this film were more interesting than the ones left in, another sign of how chopped down it was. A miniseries would suit the Inheritance Cycle much better.  So why did I give it two stars instead of one? While, I have to admit there were a few, tiny bits of entertainment in there, and the better half of the actors were pretty good, actually. John Malkovich did a pretty good job of bringing a sinister, threatening air to Galbatorix, especially considering the meager screen time and lousy script that he had to work with. Jeremy Irons did a pretty good job too; compared to some of them, he seemed to be the only one who was trying. Robert Carlyle made a good Durza, though it was kind of disappointing that he didn't have red eyes. Hedlune acted out the roguish Murtagh well, and probably resembled the character physically more than any of the other actors resembled their characters. Finally, some of the music and themes in the movie were decent and entertaining.  Overall, don't waste your money on this embarrassment. Read the books, which are a thousand times better than this lousy piece of mutilated plot. If you're a fan of the books, you'll probably want to see it at least once, if only for the comedy value of how horrendously it was done. However, this pathetic movie does not have my recommendation.,000,000,000 times better than this lousy piece of mutilated plot. If you're a fan of the books, you'll probably want to see it at least once, if only for the comedy value of how horrendously it was done. However, this pathetic movie does not have my recommendation.

B001KVAMM4|5.0|I was delighted with this package of CD and DVD, which gave me aesthetic satisfaction to hear one of my favorite violin concertos (plus extra chamber music) by Mendelsohn played by a consummate artist like Sophie. She is also a very attractive woman & a joy to watch.    I also enjoyed the DVD about Mendelsohn.    This combination CD/DVD was very good value
B001P9KR8U|1.0|I thought this was certainly the best film of 2008. It's probably in my top 10 of all time. However, the box says that it has several special features including a featurette w/ Danny Boyle and 12 deleted scenes. The only \\"Special Features\\" this DVD has is trailers for other movies. Are a lot of people having this problem? I pre-ordered through Amazon and received it a day early.I wonder if that has anything to do with it.
B00127RAJY|5.0|I gained 50 pounds from my pregnancy this past year, and my son is now 6 months old. I have been exercising to 30 day shred 1 for the past month or so since I still had about 15 pounds to lose to get back to my pre-pregnancy weight. For me, I haven't lost more than 5 pounds (but 5 pounds is GREAT for a little over a month!), which is healthy for me since I'm nursing. But on top of that, my body has changed dramatically! This DVD kicked my butt, but it was quick (as there are no breaks, but it's only a 20 minute workout), and the results have pleased me greatly! My arms and legs look better than before I was pregnant! The abs didn't do much for me, but I've always been used to doing a lot longer ab workouts. The hard work really pays off!! I'll definitely be going to level 2; thank you, Jillian!!
006112429X|2.0|This book is not for everyone. This author was recomended to me because I love Anita Shreve. Well, Shriver is nothing like Anita Shreve. I felt the prose was terse, long and difficult to read. The book is way too long. And at the end you really don't find any answers. Shriver is no doubt a very intelligent woman. She has a great English vocabulary which is thrown in readers' face in every sentence. Always \\"ambiguous\\" never \\"not sure\\". This book didn't make me feel anything ecxept horror. No sypmathy, no compassion. And the way it ends-I have no closure or undertanding of teenage angst either. It's like finding out about autrocious crime and wishing you never did.
B001PPLIEQ|5.0|This meets all the criteria of a masterful adventure but it also has a conscience without rubbing it in our faces. About a year ago I read where Matt Damon liked his character from the Bourne series because he was not Bond.   I agreed with that assessment.   But with the newer attempt to make James Bond a contemporary MI6 player we're seeing something that has been avoided in the past and that is a human machine with a heart. He may not wear it on his sleeve but actions do speak louder than words. He's not a cold agent of vengeance (even as he sometimes looks and acts like one) but a man trying to make a difference as well as hold his own agency's feet to the fire. In his defiance Bond risks exposing the sad state of today's political realities but also acts to retain or recover some ideal worth defending. Like Jason Bourne he knows he's been someone's patsy but decides to spin that into a benefit.   The bottom line; James Bond is trying to protect not only England, but the free world, from the greedy, jaded players and puppeteers who think the world and its people are up for grabs. In that, he's finally doing his job.  Would Ian Flemming be proud? I can only hope he would be.  I'm sorry for the lacking specificity to any actions and scenes. Suffice it to say, I want you to see it with a clear head and open eyes.  One bit of advice: leave your nostalgia at the door.
B0011KQSZ4|5.0|My wife and I thought it was great. I feel sorry for the people who give this film only one star, and don't find it funny. I wonder what they laugh at?

B00006DEFA|5.0|Beautifully made film of the life of Mozart (Tom Hulce), told from the point of view of rival composer Antonio Salieri (F. Murray Abraham), now an old man living in an insane asylum.    I'm not sure how accurate \\"Amadeus\\" is, with respect to historical details (in fact, from what I can remember, the stage version gives different and contradictory accounts of some of the events in the film), but unless you are specifically looking for a documentary on the life Mozart, that's not too great an issue. \\"Amadeus\\" takes the basic details of a number of historical figures and spins a story around them that is even better than real life. It is a classic tale of rivalry with religious overtones, lavish musical numbers (taken from Mozart's operas, although translated into English), and some of the most gorgeous costumes you have ever seen.    Everyone in this film is perfectly cast, and Abraham well deserved the Best Actor Oscar that he received, but for me it was Hulce who stole the show with his inane laugh and catalogue of eccentricities. Hulce never really went on to much after \\"Amadeus\\", and I will admit that I wasn't all that impressed with his performances in other movies (such as \\"Parenthood\\" and \\"Mary Shelley's Frankenstein\\"), but Mozart seems like the part that he was born to play and this film is worth watching, if only for him.
0439023483|4.0|Good dystopian fiction always poses the question \\"what does it mean to be human in a world often devoid of humanity?\\"  The world of the Hunger Games is certainly devoid of humanity, yet Suzanne Collins has given us two characters utterly recognizable in their humanness.    Certainly the book is violent, particularly for its targeted age group.  But what is golden about this book are the small moments the author has created for the reader.  It's not the gore, not the futuristic stylings, but the way the characters interact with each other as humans.  I enjoyed spending time with these characters.  In many ways, it reminds me of the great Michael Mann movies, like \\"Heat\\" and \\"Collateral\\".  The plot pushes forward entertainingly, but its greatness is when the characters simply share a moment together.    I'm not going to give away any plot points, but I will say that recalling Peeta's story about seeing Katniss for the first time on their first day of school still brings a smile to my face.

0887307280|2.0|Ok, for one, I listened to the audio version of this book which is unabridged.  Here's my breakdown of the pros and cons of this book :    Pros :  - Creates a few good terms for clarifying roles in business such as Technician, Manager, and Entrepreneur.    - Franchise model is a natural evolutionary step for many businesses    Cons :  - Author is condescending like a authoritative parent-figure who \\"knows what's right for you better than you ever could\\" throughout the book though this tapers off somewhat towards the end.    - Author makes the mistake of assuming *all* businesses naturally are improved via the franchise model, which is frankly, stupid.  This does not work for many business types such as software or game development.  Book also prioritizes quantity over quality in the franchise model, despite claims made in the book that quality should not be skimped on (this is mentioned in relation to McDonalds where they say the quality of the burger is consistent throughout the various actual restaurant which is true, but this does not make it healthy or detriment the overall low-quality of the meat and ingredients involved in creation of said burger).    - Furthermore, the title is \\"...Why Most *Small* Businesses Don't Work...\\".  Basically, from what the author says, the reason they don't work is simply because they are not *big* business, or IE - Franchises.  This is a bit of a paradox and obviously underpins the authors own preconceived ideas about how to run *big* businesses.  Franchises have their own pros and cons too, which I will leave out of this review.  The author should write a book with the title \\"...Why Most Big Businesses Don't Work...\\" and review how to turn franchises into mom and pop stores so both sides of the fence are covered.    - The book states things so obvious in business as to be truisms.  Seriously, if you did not know 90% of what this book states to you, you should question whether you should be in business at all.  Anyone with half abrain can take a look at McDonalds and see the points the author makes with just 10 minutes worth of critical thinking.    - The stories in this book are cutesy, silly, and are supposed to illustrate points, but come across as shallow, authoritative, dictator-worthy versions of how \\"well-versed\\" the author is in the realm of business.  I'm willing to bet that the author has made more money off this book than he ever has in actual business.  To add insult to injury on this point, the morals of these stories banal and weak, and don't add significantly to the book.  This text/speech would have been much better used citing actual examples in business (he cited 3 : McDonalds, IBM, and Fedex, though the last 2 only briefly) rather than the lame story he beats like a dead horse throughout the book, and also simply stating his points directly and illustrating why with the actual business examples.    My overall sense of this book is that the content is far far overrated.  For someone to recommend this book, they would have to veritably clueless in the realm of business.  I am no business mogul but I can safely say that the information in this book is pretty evident to anyone who asks themselves \\"why ___ business has succeeded and how they did it\\".  Basic critical thinking skills (perhaps this is just a sign of the times we live in that people think they actually need books like this).    The good points of this book you can walk away with without reading it are :  - Use your small business as a prototype of the \\"stamp\\" of the large business and when successful, stamp it out en-masse until it becomes a full-blown franchise.    - Presentation is important (This is my advice : don't overblow this.  \\"All style and no substance\\" is not an admirable business goal.)    - Recognize the business's need for growth or you'll have growing pains.    - Have a plan for growth and for each position's role and responsibility.  Clarify it right down to a \\"here's how you do it step-by-step\\" level.  Create book where all these plans are listed together for future reference and training of new employees.    At this point, you no longer need to read this book.  Just go study businesses and ask yourself a lot of questions (how, what, why, where, who).  Then ask these questions to people you know.  Believe me, that will put you way ahead of anything this book can provide.  Best of succe$$ to you.

B001F7MSFW|5.0|Plot synopsis.  Not gonna do it.  Sorry.<br /><br />This film is truly enchanting on a level that I didn't expect.  I really enjoyed the first Hellboy(happened to be an old-school fan of the comic) and enjoyed some Lovecraftian mythology thrown into the ring of comic book conventions.  Sure, the plot details were a little bit murky.  Sure, some of the action scenes between Hellboy and the demon dogs were repetitive.  But Hellboy II rectifies all of the flaws and holds itself up as a true masterwork of filmed fantasy fiction.<br /><br />I can't go on enough about how great Ron Perlman is in this film, as well as the original.  He's one of the few actors out there that truly uses make-up effects as a jumping point opposed to an inhibition.  The whole concept of a demon from another dimension with the attitude of a blue collar American is so surreal, funny, and truly captivating that you can't help but smile and root for his success.  His romance with Liz Sherman is further fleshed if not less estranged from the previous film.  You truly feel that they are kindred spirits in an extraordinary circumstance.<br /><br />The opening scene of the film sets up the tone and themes of fairy tales.  After Guillermo Del Toro's previous film, the brilliant and best film of the new millenium, Pan Labrynth, he has been infatuated with folk-lore and fairy tale mythology.  The first Hellboy was soaked in Lovecraf mythology, but this one goes for a more Pan's Labrynth tone.  That means, dark but still fancifull.  The sequence that takes place in the Troll market is a perfect example of this.  Now this sequence is totally visual and utterly stimulating.  Various mythological creatures and fairies collide together simply going about their daily business.  There isn't any boring expositions or deep explanations in the form of dialogue during this sequence.  It's all in the visuals.  We get to see the daily life of some other-worldly beings and the visuals truly speak for themselves.  My imagination was reeling during the minutes spent in this set piece.  Like others have mentioned, it reminded me of the Tattooine sequence from the original Star Wars.  I'm sure that was on Del Toro's mind when writing and directing the sequence.<br /><br />The action sequences are big and loud.  Why else would Hollywood fund such an offbeat project?  To me, at least, the action is the least memorable sequences of the film.  The characters pop.  They're actually relatable despite being demons, elves, and fish-men.  Though, a special note must be made to the action scene involving a giant plant creature.  It starts off like the usual slam-bang monster destroying the city Godzilla style stuff, but ends up ending more introspectively for Hellboy and for the audience.  Thank you Mr. Del Toro, you didn't have to do that, but it's appreciated immensely.<br /><br />Doug Jones finally gets his due as well.  Mr. Jones plays the Abe Sapien, the forementioned fish man, but this time he gets to use his actual voice, as opposed to being dubbed in later by David Hyde Pierce.  Why they dubbed him is beyond me.  His actual voice fits the character and he comes off like an accomplished actor as opposed to a simple monster suit wearing stunt man.  Romance brews for Abe in this film as well.  Hellboy and Abe share a scene that involves beer and Barry Manilow that is perfection of absurdity and honesty.  It's all played straight, not campy or in a parody sense, and it's all the funnier for it.<br /><br />The speial effects are awesome.  CGI, make-up effects, real live sets, and animatronic creature suits all mesh together.  This, I feel, is the best way to do this type of film.  Using only CGI for creature characters always takes some weight off of them.  You never truly believe they share the same space as the live actors.  When you mix the technology it comes off in a seamless mosaic of technicque. All CGI always feels too synthetic to me.  It's like watching one of those old RPG gamesfrom Sega CD.  You never really feel the danger of the enviorment or the foes.<br /><br />The villain in this movie is also a great creation.  I don't just mean in make-up and acting.  The writing behind it is brilliant.  He is the cause of our heroes' woes but he isn't entirely wrong in his thinking.  Is he extreme?  Yes, but he's not a cackling Bond villain with no other purpose in life but to be evil for evil's sake.  His story is just as tragic as it is villainous.  Plus, he effects our heroes's at the end of the film in a way that was unexpected.  Sure, it may seem to some like sequel bait, but if this flick never gets a sequel it still seems like a natural progressions of the characters' archs.<br /><br />I'm a sucker for monster movies.  They were always my favorite type of films as a child.  I always found myself rooting or relating to the outcasted creatures of the night more than the heroes.  This film has the added benefit, at least for me, of having cool monsters as the villains, but also as the heroes.  Perfect.  It's like Clive Barkers great book Cabal, but done correctly on film.  You will never think of Tooth Fairies the same way after this film!  Probably the best action sequence in the film involves the little critters.<br /><br />Danny Elfman's score should also receive attention.  It's sublime and not over-powering the images.  His big scores are usually more boisterous, though his score for the first two Batmans worked in unisen with the visuals.<br /><br />This film will feed your imagination.  It will give you images to nosh over for weeks.  It manages to be funny, touching, exciting, and tragic all at once.  I want all my super heroes to come from hell from now on!<br /><br />PS:  There is an ecological undertone to the film, so if you're an extreme righty, just skip the film, and make sure the day, if ever, they show it to your kids' in school for recreation that you get them a 'get-out-of-jail' free card, so they can stay home with you and listen to Rush Limbaugh instead.

031606792X|3.0|While I really liked Twilight, New Moon, and Eclipse (my favorite because it made me laugh and cry); Breaking Dawn lacked the important and proper editting that the first three in the series had.  It also seemed to lack the intimate voice the first three books had.
B001K3JF7K|5.0|Diana Krall has always been one of my very favorite songbirds; and her latest CD proves she's still got what it takes. Diana can take a song and make it exceptionally beautiful; and that's precisely what she does on this album with moving renditions of ballads that highlight that elegant bossa nova style of music. The quality of the sound is excellent; and that artwork is very well done indeed!<br /><br />The album starts with Diana singing \\"Where or When\\" by Rodgers and Hart. \\"Where or When\\" gets the royal treatment from Diana who sings this in a most romantic bossa nova way. When Amazon says that she gives a \\"sensual\\" performance they sure are right! \\"Where or When\\" gets a fine bossa nova arrangement and that music works wonders for this ballad. The music fits in perfectly with Diana's vocals; but wisely the musicians never steal the spotlight away from Diana. Diana's squarely front and center--right where she belongs! In addition, \\"I've Grown Accustomed To Your Face\\" from My Fair Lady never sounded better than it does on this album; Diana makes this shine brighter than silver and gold combined! Again, the musical arrangement makes good use of the brass and percussion to enhance the natural beauty of this ballad. I especially enjoy that remarkably famous bossa nova song by Stan Getz and João Gilberto entitled \\"The Boy From Ipanema.\\" It's a major highlight of this album. The original title was \\"The Girl From Ipanema\\" but many female singers have performed this just changing the gender of the person they sing about. Diana's rendition about the man she wants in her life stuns me with its beauty. I love it!<br /><br />\\"Walk On By,\\" a song by Burt Bacharach and Hal David, is a highlight of this album; Diana sings this with panache and I'm very impressed. \\"Walk On By\\" is one of those songs that's tough to forget; and when Diana and the musicians perform this the end result is nothing short of heavenly. \\"Este Seu Olhar\\" is another Jobim bossa nova tune that Diana does to perfection; and \\"So Nice\\" is so well done that I could never tire of hearing this track. How's about that piano arrangement?<br /><br />\\"Quiet Nights,\\" the title track for this CD, gets a sensitive treatment from the great Diana Krall; and \\"Guess I'll Hang My Tears Out To Dry\\" is nothing short of sublime in Diana Krall's capable hands. \\"How Can You Mend A Broken Heart\\" is a gorgeous bonus track that shows yet again just how well Diana Krall can cover a pop song; \\"How Can You Mend A Broken Heart\\" is one of my favorite songs on this CD. The album also ends strong with Diana Krall performing Cole Porter's \\"Everytime We Say Goodbye.\\" \\"Everytime We Say Goodbye\\" charms me with its beauty and that's grand.<br /><br />Diana Krall tackles these songs and she never falters. I'm impressed, to say the least. I highly recommend this CD for Diana's fans; and people who like bossa nova will want this album, too. Indeed, Diana does such a good job on this album that it also makes a great place to start for people just discovering the incredible talent of Diana Krall.d \\"So Nice\\" is so well done that I could never tire of hearing this track.

0553807048|4.0|A great book, a great story. Jordon Belfort is like many I have seen, and have done my best not to emulate totally. The guy is an effing genius living the life, but went too far. A total all or nothing. Still loved the book and ordered the sequel
B0019M06JS|5.0|Bossa Nova Stories is a fine new album by Eliane Elias; I'm very impressed! She sings wonderfully as she puts her heart and soul into each and every ballad she sings. Eliane has the ability to sing out a song and use her voice to convey every last nuance of the emotions in a song's lyrics; and her impeccable sense of timing enhances her performance all the more. The quality of the sound on this CD is excellent; and I love that artwork--it's all very tastefully done.<br /><br />The CD starts with the classic boss nova ballad entitled \\"The Girl From Ipanema\\" by Antonio Carlos Jobim. \\"The Girl From Ipanema\\" sports some great percussion and the strings are used to great advantage. This number creates an auspicious beginning for the album and that's grand. Eliane sings this with a great deal of feeling and just one listen proves it. In addition, \\"The More I See You\\" has a fine musical arrangement--but the music never steals the show from Eliane; she remains squarely front and center, right where she belongs! The arrangement isn't just pretty; it's also very creative and it all holds its own very well. I love it!<br /><br />\\"They Can't Take That Away From Me\\" by George Gershwin gets a major transfusion of that elegant bossa nova sound; and it works well. Eliane performs this without letting go of a single superfluous note. I also like \\"Desafinado (Slightly Out Of Tune)\\" by Antonio Carlos Jobim. Not only does \\"Desafinado (Slightly Out Of Tune)\\" sound heavenly when I hear Eliane sing it faultlessly, it seems so fresh and new when she sings it. \\"Estate (Summer)\\" is a particularly beautiful number; I agree with some other reviewers that this ballad is a big highlight of this album.<br /><br />\\"Too Marvelous For Words\\" has a bossa nova sound that has something of a smooth jazz side dish served along with it; Eliane handles this like the pro she always is! \\"Falsa Baiana\\" is a Portuguese number that gets the royal treatment by Eliane Elias and the musicians; they do this one up right! It has a spirited sound with notes that are almost staccato. \\"Minha Saudade\\" by João Donato is one of the most beautiful bossa nova numbers I've ever heard; and that lush musical arrangement is very memorable. \\"Minha Saudade\\" is also one of my very favorite songs on this CD and I think you'll like it very much if you enjoy bossa nova music.<br /><br />\\"A Rã (The Frog)\\" by João Donato and Caetano Veloso has another great piano arrangement; and the CD ends very nicely with Eliane Elias performing \\"Day By Day.\\" \\"Day By Day\\" plays with major and minor keys a little to enhance the natural beauty of this ballad; and it makes a fine closing number for this album.<br /><br />Eliane Elias has given us a gift by sharing her talent with us; we are so much better off for it. This CD is a \\"must-have\\" for Eliane's fans; and people who enjoy bossa nova music will not be disappointed.d sound with notes that are almost staccato. \\"Minha Saudade\\" by João Donato is one of the most beautiful bossa nova numbers I've ever heard; and that lush musical arrangement is very memorable. \\"Minha Saudade\\" is also one of my very favorite songs on this CD and I think you'll like it very much if you enjoy bossa nova music.     \\"A Rã (The Frog)\\" by João Donato and Caetano Veloso has another great piano arrangement; and the CD ends very nicely with Eliane Elias performing \\"Day By Day.\\" \\"Day By Day\\" plays with major and minor keys a little to enhance the natural beauty of this ballad; and it makes a fine closing number for this album.

B001E75QGG|4.0|Follows the storyline of the Indy movies and compliments  the series. Great for all ages. helps to have seen the  previous Indy movies, but not a must.  I reserve a five star movie for one that, makes me sob,  laugh till I cry, or can't blink in amazement.  Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull is  worth the $17.00 Amazon want for it.
B0017V7GTY|5.0|Sure, you'll find The Gaslight Anthem categorized as a punk band, but they draw from so many influences in the history of American rock music that they're much, much more than that.  It's like they've taken the base of punk and polished it with the best of the 60s, 70s, and 80s.  It's catchy, it tells a story, and it sure goes well with a drive down the highway.
B001CD3PLU|3.0|I love this movie, it is probably my #1 favorite of all time. I bought the UK version because the USA hasn't released it yet. I am disappointed with the quality. It is not blue ray quality at all. This becomes very noticeable in the dark scenes and it gets very grainy. Looks like it was just transfered to blu ray disc but not digitally enhanced or cleaned up.<br /><br />My regular DVD played thru my up converting player looks better than the blu ray unfortunately.<br /><br />Hopefully the USA release will have a remastered version that will be true HD quality.

B001K3JF7K|4.0|Diana's latest CD release has a great collection of romantic standards and classic Jobim songs (i.e., Corcovado = Quiet Nights) and reunites her with her great accompanists of Anthony Wilson, John Clayton, Jeff Hamilton, Paulinho da Costa and Claus Ogerman that were also on her greatest album and concert DVD IMHO, \\"Live In Paris\\".  Her singing is intentionally quiet and muted which fits the overall atmosphere of the album tracks.  Great touch with the ebony and ivory as usual. I do have a bit of a problem with the audio quality which seemed to be a bit lacking overall. Can't wait for the \\"Live In Rio\\" concert on DVD and Blu-Ray coming this May...
0061020710|3.0|Here is where it all began, the birth of the Discworld series, and the introduction of perhaps the most incompetent wizzard (yes, that is wizzard with a double z) in all of literature: Rincewind.  In this book we find the first mention of the fascinating twin cities of Ankh and Morpork, and of course we are able to observe the benefits of owning luggage made from sapient pearwood.  You might be wondering, why would I possible only give this book a 3 star rating?  I first read The Color of Magic almost 10 years ago, when I stumbled upon it while browsing in the University of Utah bookstore during a break between my graduate school classes.  I was looking for something entertaining and light, something that would take my mind off the boring business text books that required so much of my time.  The book delivered.  I was immediately hooked, and over the last 1o years I've read all 36 of the Discworld novels.  So, why 3 stars? Who, or what, has outshone this Discworld classic?  The answer is easy, it's Terry Pratchett himself.  The Discworld novels have only gotten better as Pratchett keeps writing, both in complexity and execution.  After reading Thud! (number 34), my favorite Discworld novel of all time, The Color of Magic feels a little less polished, and I realize how spoiled I've become.  I'm trying to remember how I felt the first time I read this book, but I can't.  I've lost the remembrance in the haze of too many books over too many years, but it must have really blown me away.  I remember buying the next four books in the series at the same time, so it must have impressed me.  That isn't to say that this book isn't good.  It is!  It just can't compare to later Discworld novels.  So, if you haven't ever visited Discworld before, start at the beginning, so you can appreciate this book for yourself, in the way it should be.  One caveat, it does end with a bit of a cliff hanger, so have The Light Fantastic handy.
B001EJYOBM|5.0|Love the series, can't wait for Season 2 (and 3 for that matter). Now that that is out of the way....how about a fundamentally helpful question?    What (other than the Steelbook packaging) is there CONTENT-wise (if anything) that makes this collection of Season 1 any different than the one I already have? I would like to know. Episodes, check. Extended episodes, check. Gag Reel, check. Featurettes, check. Widescreen, check. What MORE is in this? Someone with their hands on it please chime in, since the marketers failed to be forthcoming on the product page here.
0385340990|5.0|I had heard so many great things about this book that it made me nervous. I approached this book with trepidation because I was certain that it couldn't live up to the many rave reviews, and that it would be sure to leave me disappointed.  To my surprise, not only did it exceed my expectations, but it will now have a permanent place in my library as one of my favorite reads of all time.<br />The novel itself is written in the format of a series of letters, telegrams, and even a few journal entries, written shortly after the conclusion of World War 2.  I always find this format interesting, perhaps because in our age of technology it is actually very rare to receive a true letter in the mail.  I found myself slightly jealous of the main character for the opportunity she had to look forward to receiving such truly remarkable messages on paper, that were then hers to treasure for as long as she wished.  Letters like these certainly put our text messages and email greetings to shame!<br />The novel is the story of Juliet Ashton, a writer who has achieved some notoriety for her light-hearted weekly newspaper column during the war.  Juliet is seeking to leave the war behind, both personally and professionally, and is searching for the subject of her next book.  Coincidentally, she receives an amazing letter from a stranger named Dawsey Adams, a native of Guernsey, one of the Channel Islands which had been occupied by the Nazi's during the war.  Adams enlists Juliet's aid in obtaining a copy of some additional works written by his favorite author, Charles Lamb, and in the process interests Juliet in the history and origins of the Guernsey Literary society.  Soon, Juliet finds herself not only corresponding with, but building friendships with Dawsey's friends and neighbors as she seeks to understand their wartime experiences.  Eventually Juliet travels to Guernsey, and becomes a part of the story herself.<br />This was a fast and enjoyable read.  I really couldn't put this book down, and I found myself longing for more even as I turned the last page.  This is a book that I will be adding to my read again pile!nd I found myself longing for more even as I turned the last page.  This is a book that I will be adding to my read again pile!

B001IAOEXU|5.0|I have 4 sets of these and am very satisfied.  The PS3 controllers should be built like this.  I play mostly FPS games and to my dismay many of these games use R2 (instead of R1) to shoot.  The RealTriggers make it much easier to hit L2 and R2.  Keeping in mind that these probably cost about 2 cents to make; I would still highly recommend them.

031606792X|5.0|Its amazing how much opinion differs on this book.  I've read the series and out of the four - Breaking Dawn is my favorite.  I enjoyed how the characters seemed to mature (finally) and how many things were explained.  I especially liked Bella's character in this novel over the other books because she finally starts acting like an adult.<br /><br />Read all the reviews and decide for yourself.  If you are still in doubt, you can always check it out of the library instead of purchasing.
B001TOD92C|5.0|The critics hailed \\"The resurrection of Mickey Rourke.\\"  While,others exclaimed, \\"The Comeback Kid.\\"  Sean Penn even acknowledged during his exceptance speech for the best actor win, a win Mickey should have had, \\"It's great to have you back!\\"  Well, folks, Mickey never left.  We left him!  Just check out his filmography and you will see that, with the exception of 2007 (the year he was filming \\"The Wrestler\\"), he continued to work, sometimes putting out 1 to 3 films a year.  Oh sure, he pumped out some bad ones, who doesn't?  But if you love Mickey, and watch his performances closely, you will see that he never lets you down.  It's as if he is saying through his acting...\\"I know I've hit rock bottom, I know I've lost my audience, I know I've messed up my face, I know I have nothing to show...but wait, I do have something to offer...Me!  My acting ...I can still act!\\" If you want to see one of the more memorable and sensitive portrayals in recent years, pick up \\"The Wrestler\\" with Mickey Rourke...He will pin you down and make you cry.
0143038419|5.0|I have a feeling there is a whole community of people who are reading Eat Pray Love for the second time. This could be the start of a whole new book club:  The Second Time Around book club!    I enjoyed this book immensely the first time...and so much more the second time!  In my own work life as a writer, I'm under a lot of stress right now (who isn't?) and every day for the last couple of weeks I carved out some time to soak in a hot bath and take in a few more of her \\"beads.\\"  If you know the book, you'll know what I mean.    This is an excellent meditation on reclaiming the joy of living, which can be had in your own backyard. However, Bali does have a certain ring to it. It's fascinating to see how extreme the reactions are to this book. I'm only sorry for the people who put it down too early because they couldn't abide the indulgence of her buying underwear. Anyone who knows what it's like to separate yourself for years from the sensory pleasures of life recognizes such a moment as a graduation ceremony. An awakening that only gets better throughout the book.    Enjoy.
B001R7IHA0|4.0|Keith Urban's musicianship continues to be top-notch with fretwork that's skillful and impressive, but in a subtle, unforced way.  As has become the case with much of Urban's progressive music, many of the songs have distinct Country cues, but still blend easily across genre lines and could just as well be considered Pop or Soft Rock.  The songs on \\"Defying Gravity\\" are well-written, catchy, and energetic.  There are bound to be 2 or 3 commercial hits from this excellent album.  Though it doesn't apply to every song, the album has an overall carefree \\"breezy\\" vibe the likes of which Kenny Chesney could only aspire.

B001P9KR94|4.0|I absolutely loved this movie and loved the way it was presented. It's a truly uplifting story of destiny - even when you think life has you beat down.    I'd recommend the blu-ray copy as well b/c there are some scenes that just evoke so much more emotion in true HD.
B001K3JF7K|4.0|Diana Krall's new album, \\"Quiet Nights\\",  has that glossy sound that one expects from a Tommy Li Puma (who co-produced with Krall) project. Diana's breathy vocals are sultry, close-mic'ed, and clean as crystal. Typical of a Diana Krall album, the set list is comprised of standards; there are no new compositions here. The songs, from composers like Jobim, Rogers & Hart, Lerner & Loewe, Bacharach & David, Cahn & Styne, are all infused with bossa nova arrangements.    Ms. Krall is again joined by her customary rhythm section, including Jeff Hamilton on drums, John Clayton on bass, Anthony Wilson on guitar, and Paulinho Da Costa on percussion.    In a departure from her previous set, 2006's \\"From This Moment On\\", there are no big-band arrangements this time around. All the songs feature Claus Ogerman's lush orchestrations - and as much as I love that sound (Ogerman and Li Puma perfected it as far back as George Benson's \\"Breezin'\\" in 1976), there's a little too much of it here.     \\"Sultry\\" and \\"lush\\" are the operative descriptors for this album, but \\"swing\\" is nowhere to be found. I kept wishing for the tempo to pick up some speed, and for some of these great players to stretch out for some fine soloing, but there is precious little instrumental flair to be heard. Krall, whose stellar piano chops have been demonstrated time and again, seems content to provide fills and licks, but never takes an extended solo on the disc. Fans of Wilson's guitar must be patient until he gets a short solo on \\"Guess I'll Hang My Tears out to Dry\\".    Diana Krall afficiandos will find this disc a welcome addition to her discography, but to hear how good she and her cohorts can really PLAY, check out her \\"Live in Paris\\" disc from 2002.
0307269752|4.0|I didn't know this author, which was recommmended to me by a relative.  I found the first third of the book kind of confussing:  it takes some time to get used to unfamiliar Swedish names and places, and a lot of characters are presented, setting a slow pace.  But when I got to the middle, I couldn't put it down and finished in one sitting.  Well written, different stories are perfectly wooven into one another, and it keeps you wishing for more, can't wait till the next.  And I totally agree with another reviewer about the title ... the original \\"Men who hate Women\\" makes so much more sense ...
B000AMJC2K|4.0|I purchased this arm for my 22\\" LCD monitor and at first I was disappointed to find that the joints did not hold the monitor in place - the monitor would bow down under its weight. However after reading that these joints need to be fastened with a lot of force, I went back and tried again. I must say that I had to make a lever in order to fasten the adjustment screws to keep the monitor in an upright position. I couldn't do it with the small tools included. In addition, these joints come loose when moving the monitor around so it will need fastening every now and then. That's why I didn't give it 5 stars.    The product instruction sheet says that the arm can take up to 8 kg (16 lb) of weight, so my 5kg monitor is not too heavy.    Otherwise, the product looks nice, doesn't take up as much space on the desk as monitor's own stand and allows the monitor to be set in almost any position.

Oh, and did I mention the vocals by sultry android-chicks? If you're a fan of the previous album \\"Witching Hour\\" (and you should be), then you'll find just as much to like with this one.

1932907009|5.0|[[ASIN:1932907009 Save The Cat! The Last Book on Screenwriting You'll Ever Need]]    The last book on screenwriting you will ever need.  That's the subtitle of the little book, \\"Save the Cat.\\"  I say little, because it is a rather short book when compared with, say Robert Mckee's \\"The Story.\\"  But length, here, should not be confused with something that lacks quality.    There is a sharp difference between writing a screenplay and writing a novel.  I have tried both, and I find writing the novel is a much easier task, quite simply because the novelist is allowed more latitude, the novel uses words to tell the story, a screen writer must resort to that more subtle style of letting pictures inform our imagination.  But make no mistake, the name of the game is about freeing up our imagination.  Blake Snyder understands this.  Sure, Snyder gives us a well structured model, but do not mistake this for concretized rigidity.  There seems to be some confusion that artists do not have to adhere to a formal structure.  An interesting concept, that.  If anything, Bach understood structure, as did Mozart.  No slouches, these two. Those who criticize Snyder's approach remind me of the petulant child that eschews discipline for whatever free form may be in vogue at the moment. Such people often display an audacity that their \\"art\\" would even best a Michelangelo, but in point of fact, such people confuse aesthetics with flatulence to be enjoyed in the company of one.  We need to remind such dilettantes that even van Gogh understood, implicitly, the \\"rules\\" of art.    So why read \\"Save the Cat?\\"  Why this book over, let's say McKee's \\"Story\\" for instance?  What does Snyder do with his book others don't?  First off, Snyder makes no pretense that he is providing a \\"how to book\\" on aesthetics.  What Snyder gives us is a book on how to begin a process in what hopefully, for each person \\"bullheaded\\" enough to soldier on, to write a screenplay.  Snyder's approach is about mastering a craft.  And a craft it is.  And yet, at no point does Snyder suggest that this craft cannot be in harmony with doing art.  To take the craft of writing a screenplay and turning that same product into a piece of art of Bergmanesque quality is not Snyder's job, and he makes no pretense that it is.    More importantly, however, is Snyder's passion, what can only be described as a love affair with writing.  But again, herein lies some confusion.  Some have argued against this book because it offers the possibility that you too, might sell a script if you follow his advice.  My god, selling a script ... for money ... how gauche.  The mere idea of making money from what one loves is tantamount to pandering to the masses, and we all know were that gets us.  Ask the French about uncontrolled masses.    But in all seriousness, Snyder does what few, if any, writer does.  Snyder gets up close and personal.  Snyder cares enough about those who set aside their hard earned dollars and buy his book.  Snyder is willing to talk to his readers, to engage those who take the time to dialogue with him (my god, he provides an email address, and he answers his correspondents).  That, for me, is the mark of a truly generous teacher.  In the end, that should be the question.  Is he willing to teach what he knows?  The answer is yes.  And the mark of a good teacher, as in Snyder's case, is that he has the ability to present to us in uncomplicated terms a logic to the structure of screenwriting that is easily accessible.

B001QB9H10|3.0|Jason Statham has made a career of being a great action star often overlooked even though he has crafted a dizzying array of movies that showcased his talent. The first Transporter was a great film that made me have faith in movies. The second was a filled with scenes that felt forced and felt like filler.  The latest installment continues the story of the Transporter.  I found the film to be a great addition to the series with some great action sequences but beyond that it felt a little oversimplified and forced.  The plot is a stretch but intrigues none the less creating seems that are quick and sharp.  His co-star was strange and was a pain in the...but I found her quite interesting. In no way shape or form did this movie delivered a worthy installment but it did it's job...it entertained. Jason, a great talent, is the only attraction that drove some to the big screen. If you are a fan of Jason or not this still provides a great, somewhat flawed, thrill ride.

B001P9KR8U|2.0|I finally got a chance to watch the much hyped Slumdog Millionaire last night and I have to say I was a little disappointed.  Don't get me wrong, this isn't a bad movie.  It's just not the great one I was expecting after all of the awards.  It makes me wonder about the people who are giving out these award nominations....this, the God-awful Doubt, and Milk are three movies I will probably never watch again in my entire life yet they were nominated for every award imaginable.  I don't know maybe I am wrong in the point that movies are supposed to be an exciting way to entertain you for 2 hours.  Maybe these movies have some hidden meaning or artistic cinematography or some other term I am too dumb to understand, but one thing they aren't are a fun time at the theaters.  I think I would rather watch an actual carton of Milk for 2 hours than watch the actual movie Milk again.  And I don't even want to get started on the movie Doubt.  It's sad that The Dark Knight, one of the highest grossing films of all time, was not even nominated for best picture yet these movies were.  If the great Heath Ledger had not unfortunately passed on way too soon he also probably would of been snubbed.  Anyway...back to the movie.      Like I said this movie isn't that bad.  It reminds me a little of a far superior film called City of God.  It tells the life in flashbacks of a boy while he is on the Indian version of Who Wants to be a Millionaire.  The movie jumps around so much it is kind of hard to follow, and it seems like there is some scene with kids running around while it plays some sort of weird Indian rap music way too often.  Like I said, watch it once to see what it was all about, but you probably won't want to watch it again.
B001J53X9U|5.0|Just awesome. The batpod looks cool and people just love it. Movie is great also w tons of bonus features.
B000OLGCI4|5.0|A Disney classic for sure.  In the vein of the older Disney movies and not the new politically correct junk of recent memory -- Pocahontas, etc.  A story kids will love!
1400079179|5.0|Tell me, who doesn't love a captivating book? A book that keeps you turning the page in earnest to know what happens next? This is just that type of book. I've read it twice, and will read it again.<br /><br />Dan Brown amazes me with his powerful ability to twist fact and fiction to create his masterpieces. As in his book Angels & Demons, Brown shows off his talent using historical information to create an amazing adventure, leaving me mystified and enlightened. With a delightful twist ending, I find myself wanting to read the book all over again. Through his characters' eyes, I'm able to grasp the brilliance and breath-taking power of historical art with a new appreciation and understanding.
B001PPGAIA|5.0|I personally enjoyed the movie.  Thought the acting was good and scenery was spectacular.  It had a good plot, good acting and a happy ending.  I found it refreshing not to see people hacked, hung from the rafters etc.  (I know this will disappoint some but there was no car chase.  That seems to be a necessity for some). P.S. It had beautiful people in it also.
B001PPLIEG|2.0|Yes, Bond is not Superman or Spiderman or Batman.  He is a secret agent,a human being, so when I see him making totally impossible leaps just shy of leaping tall buildings in a single bound I know that the makers of this latest film are wrongly thinking more is more instead of realizing that less is more.  In the opening foot chase sequence of \\"Casino Royale\\" there was a fast, furious, high leaping foot chase - yet it was much more believable than the similar sequence in \\"Quantum.\\"  I remember the train compartment fight between Sean Connery and Robert Shaw in \\"From Russia With Love\\" - and that battle in a contained space was a hundred times more exciting than all the over-the-top action in this current Bond outing.<br /><br />Having said that, Daniel Craig is a superb Bond.  \\"Casino Royale\\" knew how to balance its relatively more believable action sequences with quieter moments of character building.  In \\"Quantum\\" we have just too, too much action (most of it totally unbelievable and more suited for a superhero movie), often inaudible dialog, editing speed that makes much of what is going on or even being said too fast-paced and a plot that is totally impossible to follow unless you have seen \\"Casino.\\"  The villain's motivations are quite absurd also, once we finally figure them out.<br /><br />The movie is still a worth-see because of those too-seldom subtler scenes where we see Craig's Bond more as a human being than as when he is playing Superman.  I hope the next Bond film is toned down a couple notches - and that the producers and director realize that action isn't everything, especially when it is insulting to the intelligence because NO one could survive most of the stuff that happens in this installment.<br /><br />Still worthwhile, even for Craig and Judi Dench alone.
B001M5UDGS|5.0|its utterly perfect. its a great buy, and something you'll want to keep forever and watch again and again. the actors do an amazing job, as well as the director and producer. its the best 45 minutes of your life!    \\"now the nightmares real. now dr. horrible is here..\\"
B000000W5L|5.0|This disk was originally a two record set, that included post cards, and inserts.  The release itself is wonderful, from cover to cover.  Rockers like \\"Rocks Off\\" and \\"Rip This Joint\\" showcase the Stones with great backing support of horns and sax.  Keyboards are wonderful, with the load shared between Ian Stewart and Nicky Hopkins, who provide a perfect complement to the Stones. Mick Taylor kills on the intro to \\"Tumbling Dice\\", which also features some of the most imaginative Stones lyrics.  What was the second side features a more folksy feel, including \\"Sweet Virginia\\", \\"Torn and Frayed\\", and the stripped down \\"Black Angel\\", with tabla drums, harmonica and acoustic guitar. \\"Happy\\" is a great Keith Richards song, with strong vocals and honking horns.  \\"All Down the Line\\" is a great Stones rocker, with strong instrumentation.  This is an entertaining release from cover to cover, a must for all collections.
B001XRLWPQ|5.0|Nathan Fillion is brilliant as ABC's new world famous author-turned-pseudo-cop Richard Castle. Behind the veneer of an arrogant celebrity, who seems to have let dozens of best sellers and world acclaim go to his head, Castle is truly a kind-hearted man and a compassionate father.  Besides writing, his favorite hobby seems to be irritating Kate Beckett (Stana Katic), the NYPD detective who was in charge of a investigating a string of copy-cat murders modeled after Castle's own murder mystery books. Since he's killed off the main character of his last series, Castle needs new inspiration for his next set of novels, and he finds his muse with the charming but difficult-to-crack detective. The chemistry between Fillion and Katic is astounding, leaving the audience with more to follow than just the murder cases. Unlike most criminal investigation shows, Castle has a heavy focus on humor and the strong development of its characters and their relationships. Not quite a drama and not quite a comedy, this primetime series has elements that appeal to any sensibility. The twisted murder storylines will keep you guessing for the full hour until the conclusion you never expected.<br /><br />Bonus material for the DVD includes behind the scenes interviews with the stars, out takes, deleted scenes, and more. Strong first season. I'm greatly looking forward to watching this show thrive and burgeon into big-name status.
B001FAZYOQ|4.0|This is a good live album that captures the essence of Bowie as Ziggy and the Spiders from Mars.  Mick Ronson is the perfect complement to David, both vocally and on stage.  The material covers the scope of the first four albums, so \\"Changes\\", \\"Moonage Daydream\\", \\"Width of a Circle\\", are represented, as well as other hits.  Where this is a good live album, there is  not too much different from some of the other live releases, like the soundtrack of \\"Ziggy Stardust Final Show\\" movie.  There are cover versions like \\"My Death\\" and the Lou Reed tune, \\"Waiting for the Man\\".  I prefer this release, \\"David Live\\", and \\"Stage\\", which are better live releases.  The audio quality of this could be better, but this is still a good addition to a Bowie fan's collection.
B001GKJ2DY|2.0|\\"Mamma Mia\\", I think needed a more seasoned film director. Many of the jokes fell flat, and it felt sluggish. The play was meant to be light and feel-good. The director, Phyllida Lloyd, I have read is an acclaimed theatre director, but the \\"tricks of the trade\\" known only by those who have a passion for film making, could have made this work.    It is not that I can't enjoy a film about weddings and Abba's music, I found the use of Abba's music absolutely magical in the darker comedy \\"Muriel's Wedding\\".     Some have said just the island scenes in this were wonderful. I didn't think so. The island scenes in this film felt like nothing more than a pretty backdrop. The film could have been shot in Blue Screen. You never really feel the islands effect on the characters, It could have been shot indoors. Paul Mazursky's The Tempest, set on the Greek Isles, might not have been a great film but is a good example of characters in relationship to their environment. Films last year like \\"Vicky Christina Barcelona\\" and \\"Bruges\\" really knew the importance of location. The characters in those two films where facing comic dilemmas like the characters in Mama Mia, But I felt the the magic of the environment much more in those two films.    The story just needed to be told by a better story teller.     I was disappointed. I know you are still going to rent or buy it, but hopefully if my review lowers your expectations, you will might enjoy it more than I did. :)
B000003CMB|5.0|This is one of the live albums that accurately capture the energy and feel of the original Allman Brothers Band.  The dual drummers pound through the shuffle beats, Berry Oakley's bass holds down the lower register, and dual keyboards (Greg Allman on organ, Chuck Lavelle on piano) and dual guitars (Dickey Betts and the great Duane Allman) battle on this seven song release.  All the songs are extended energetic jam sessions that rock from start to finish.  Greg has a great live blues voice, and he wails from the heart on \\"Statesboro Blues\\" and mornfully on the classic \\"Whipping Post\\".  The band showcases their blues roots, and Duane's slide is the perfect complement to Dicky's playing.  This is a brilliant live album that is a necessary purchase.
B001PPGAIA|5.0|I understand why this film got such bad reviews, but what a story! And looking at Hugh Jackman is something I can do all day long!
B001DHXT20|5.0|enjoyed the movie kids liked it and amazon delivered quicker than I expected thanks amazon will continue to purchase dvds from you
B000J4QWM2|5.0|I wish I could say that this movie was B.S. that Michael Mann takes himself way to seriously and that didn't realize that people were making fun of the show back in the 80's. But I can't. I loved it than and I love it now. Admittedly, there are a lot of elements of the 80's show that are left out. Nevertheless, the cineamotography is beautiful; Tubbs and Crocket are super corny and American James Bonds at the same time; and the women characters rock. I can't explain it.     And while I am very much a fan of Colin Farrell earlier movies, think he is a modern metrosexual Marlin Brando, I never thought I would appreciate Jamie Foxx as a serious actor, even after Ray. But doggone it. He's done it. A kitchy classic I'm sure, but Miami Vice was brilliant.
B001R4MEYI|4.0|Mastodon-Crack The Skye ****<br /><br />With a concept so outrageous it's genius and so genius it's outrageous Mastodon, the kings of concept have out done themselves. Oh man have they! Based on a time traveler who becomes inhabited by Rasputin himself to escape assassination...I think. But really this was just drummer Dailor's was of dealing with the death of his sister Skyler.<br /><br />The opening track 'Oblivion' is one of the greatest things the band is likely ever to release. Bridging everything they have done in their past with a new more melodic feel to create a song so fitting. The album's focal point however is the four part center piece 'The Czar' which is only the second longest track.<br /><br />With time-signature changes that would make the great Frank Zappa blush guitarist Brent Hinds and crew show off their math-core chops with out meaning to show off. The do it at a moments notice to rip your face off and simply prove that they can. Speaking of Hinds, here on Crack The Skye he proves he is really the only guitar God worthy of the title in these trying times.<br /><br />Crack The Skye certainly isn't Mastodons strongest or most consistent album. But what it is, is their most experimental, honest, and all around creative effort as a group.
B001R4MEYI|5.0|First off,for all that say their getting too mellow,I can uderstand with THIS record(your opinion) However to say anything past Remissions is too 'mellow\\" just isn't right.They have have SOARED creatively, and for ONCE a  band is re-defining yet another genre in metal(especially with this album)B.Hinds was coming out of a coma when writing this record,B. Dailor was mourning his sisters death(Skye was her name) and also these guys have consumed ALOT of acid..that alone can create a VERY different vibe when writing.Put all that together- THEN take a listen..you WILL be pleased,IF you believe that not all \\"metal\\" has to sound alike.I HIGHLY recommend this album to ANYONE,even those who weren't originally fans.
B000003NA4|4.0|If you love beautifully polished standards, mid 20th century style, you'll love this cd.  \\"Peel Me a Grape\\" is, as always, irresistable.
0385340540|3.0|The Broker, although taking place in Washington at times, is not a legal thriller. Its more of a spy novel. Or is it an Italian tour guide and langauge lesson? That's where my somehwat dislike of this novel comes in. It seems a third of the tale is spent teaching both the main character and the reader Italian. Overkill doesn't begin to explain it. And that main character is somewhat hard to like given his past misdeeds. Overall, just another average read.
B000ION79Y|1.0|Being a Steven Segal fan I sat down to watch this movie and it is 2 hrs. of my life I will never get back!  The dubbing of Steven Segals voice is unbelievably bad and the plot was nonexistant. DO NOT!!! I repeat DO NOT!!! waste 2 hrs of your life on this film or rather disaster.
B001K3JF7K|1.0|Why did I buy this?! Godawful vocals, monotonously syrupy strings, and a phone-it-in performance. Her version of \\"Este Seu Olhar\\" is torturous enough for Guantanamo and the rest is almost as painful. Somebody help this woman. Truly abysmal.
B0000DZTIW|2.0|Much like the movie the music was made for, this score is for people who don't know about Asian/Japanese culture. For a movie for Western audiences, the light, hollow-sounding \\"Japanese\\" sounds will sound Asian enough.   And most people will likewise give this review a negative as they have to every other review that critiques this score from a truly musical standpoint. The typical, sweeping, swooning orchestral score that marks many Hollywood \\"epics\\" is present here, and it does fine enough within the context of a movie.  But listened to without the imagery, the music doesn't do much new. It sounds like a typical Westerner's score with a slight Asian sound to it. It's not as bad as, say, having a GONG banging in the background, but just one listen to such scores as \\"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon\\" or \\"Hero\\" will reveal the derivative and pseudo-Asian influence of \\"Last Samurai.\\"  Those who like the \\"Last Samurai\\" probably won't care that the music here is ultimately superficial, as they've also accepted the utterly absurd, utterly Hollywood fantasy in \\"Last Samurai.\\"
B001KP2Y3K|2.0|A whole album of sound-alike songs by a fine singer who needs to get over her bitterness. (but I love her anyway)

B00005JOIH|4.0|For my money, it's always worth it to buy a \\"collector's edition\\" of any Spielberg movie (especially his \\"darker\\" stuff). Although it could have been loaded even a little bit more with additional materials, I still found it insightful and informative to see \\"the process\\". Even though I usually stay current on special edition DVD releases, this one sneaked by me. Now I understand it's becoming somewhat rare. Outside of a re-release, I'd jump on this one before the price skyrockets.
B000WAEJZ0|5.0|This Isn't the type of music I usually review. But I want to let anyone luckey enough to find a copy of this and wants her greatest hits yet not that remix junk, to get It while you can!  This CD does not even come up In a search for Whitney Houston!!  4 pages yet not THIS CD!  This really Is the one to own. No doubt. Plus It's an Import from AU. so the sound Is great.  Really don't hesitate you won't find this collection any other discs.
0142412147|5.0|One afternoon when I was sick and it was stormy outside, I rummaged through my To Be Read pile and grabbed this book. I'd read (and liked) John Green before, so I expected at least a third of LET IT SNOW to be good. Curled up on my bed, I read the first half in one sitting, then read the rest that evening. This is very good, for me, since I read fast but also have a short attention span when tempted by many books.<br /><br />Curiously, my initial expectation of Green's third being my favorite part of the book didn't turn out right. Green's \\"A Cheertastic Christmas Miracle\\" came in second to Maureen Johnson's \\"Jubilee Express,\\" while Lauren's Myracle's \\"The Patron Saint of Pigs\\" came in a distant third. In more detail, here's my lineup:<br /><br />#1 Johnson wrote my favorite third of the book, carried off by the delightful narrator, Jubilee, named after one of the buildings in a fictional line of Christmas collectibles. These same collectibles, by the way, lead to a shopping riot that lands Jubilee's parents in jail and sends Jubilee on a train-ride into a blizzard... but I won't spoil what happens next in this quirky, charming story. Lots of little details make this story seem feel both real and amusingly ridiculous. The romance, especially, was sweet and fun.<br /><br />#2 Green's strengths seem to consistently be dialogue and character, though his characters do seem rather familiar at times. His story felt a lot like his other books that I've read--LOOKING FOR ALASKA and AN ABUNDANCE OF KATHERINES--with a group of clever (sometimes a little too clever, if you ask me), crazy friends examined through the eyes of a more normal guy who has a crush on a smart, eclectic, mysterious girl. That's fine with me, I guess, since I liked his other books, though I would like to see him try writing from the viewpoint of a girl for a change. Though I suppose he balances out the other authors, who write through the eyes of female characters.<br /><br />#3 Myracle's third would have to be my least favorite. It felt like the book lost some of its spark when she took over, and the ending dragged a little while the beginning and middle flew past. I'm not sure why, though I have my theories: perhaps Johnson and Green wrote their thirds first, and then Myracle had to work with the characters and material they came up with rather than introducing too many of her own ideas. Granted, Johnson and Green are tough acts to follow. Or maybe this is just Myracle's style, which I happen not to like as much as those of the other authors. Disclaimer: I won't go as far as to say Myracle's writing ruined the book, because at this point I was already intrigued by the interlocking stories and how the characters rubbed shoulders.<br /><br />Overall, LET IT SNOW wasn't an epic or deep book, by any means. Rather, it was a banana-bread kind of book: tasty, not too complicated, and when you've finished enjoying it, you don't feel too guilty. (As opposed to fluffier, junkier books.) I would recommend it to anyone who likes sweet romances and quirky teen characters.elt like the book lost some of its spark when she took over, and the ending dragged a little while the beginning and middle flew past.

B001DJ7PQ4|5.0|Dr Who is just a great series. It stands as a very well written series that includes humor, ethics, and many other issues relevant in our world today.<br /><br />And of course, it really helps that the Doctor is \\"the doctor\\".<br /><br />If you enjoy quality TV (yes, there is such a thing as quality TV as there are garbage books) this is the show for you.
B001FBSMF8|5.0|I count Chris Cornell as one of my three favorite voices in music (along with Bob Dylan and Eddie Vedder), and I have ALWAYS loved grunge - but I have to say that I think this is a superb disc.  The song writing is deep and mature, and Cornell's voice is as magnificent as ever, perhaps better than ever.  The techno stuff has never been huge for me, yet I like this more than I could ever have imagined.  I LOVE IT.  Open your minds, people.
0743270754|5.0|As someone who has always been interested in U.S. presidential history, \\"Team of Rivals\\" seemed to be a must read. The book focuses on the relationships between the political rivals that exist in the 1860s, specifically focusing on the political rise of Abraham Lincoln. The book is not for everyone, its very heavy and well over 700 pages.     The book is broken into 3 main parts. The first third focuses on traditional \\"character development\\" Goodwin provides detailed histories of the 4 major candidates competing for the 1860 Republican party Presidential Nomination, William Seward, Salmon Chase, Edward Bates, and Abraham Lincoln, describing in painstaking detail the motivation and life experience of each man. The next third focuses on the period following the nomination of Abraham Lincoln, the 1860 election, and the formation of the Lincoln administration. It details the decision making process and provides great insights into President Lincoln's motivation and character. The last third details the inner workings of the Lincoln administration and the fragile relationships and rivalries that existed.     The book is incredibly detailed and really makes the reader feel like they are experiencing the events as they happen. By laying an extensive foundation for each major power player Goodwin provides the reader with tremendous insight into what makes each man tick and how that impacted the decisions of the Lincoln administration. The part I enjoyed most was how these rivals developed deep and lasting friendships that shaped the future of the United States. I would recommend this book to other history buffs looking for true insights into the great leaders of our past.

B001R60ESE|5.0|I'm not certain that Chris Botti could release anything that I wouldn't rate a 5 so understand my bias. I have most of his audio CDs and I would rate this DVD near the top. Botti, in his own icy-cool signature, soulful and soothing sound - draws from jazz, pop and classical musical in his line-up. This CD was recorded at an event which took place on September 18th 2008 at Boston's famous Symphony Hall where Botti is joined by the Boston Pops Orchestra. In addition to new and seemingly even more compelling spins on his classic instrumental trumpet solos (\\"When I fall in Love\\"; \\"Time to Say Goodbye\\"; \\"Ave Maria\\"), Botti invites a unique cast of artists to join him on stage including Sting, Josh Groban, Steven Tyler (Aerosmith), Yo-Yo Ma, John Mayer and Katherine McPhee (American Idol) - with my favorites being \\"I've Got You Under My Skin\\" with Botti/McPhee and \\"If I Ever Lose My Faith in You\\" with Botti/Sting and John Mayer's rendition of Sinatra's \\"Glad to Be Unhappy.\\" Botti is at the top of his game in this performance - crisp, warm and soothing - and the man can hit and stick the high notes. Sit back, relax and be prepared to be entertained - - Botti has the magical ability to take you away to a happy place.

B001U891HE|4.0|This is a complete set of Shakespeare's works including his sonnets. This version boasts an active table of contents and works great. Using the search feature, I can look up all of Shakespeare's best soliloquies and lines. The only short coming is that the current act and scene does not display at the top of every \\"page\\" though I am not sure this is a feature the Kindle2 actually has in the first place. This is a real economical deal and you can carry the entire collection without throwing out your back.
B001R4MEYI|5.0|It's been nearly two and a half years since the last record from Mastodon. After Blood Mountain, what should fans expect?   Crack the Skye is a powerful album which knows how to balance heaviness and elegance. It's modeled after the Air element, as Leviathan was modeled after Water and Blood Mountain was modeled after Earth. It emulates a changing, zephyrous wind, and at times strikes out with lightning and fury.  Crack the Skye stands out against their other albums by its production alone. Thanks to the efforts of Brendan O'Brien the annoying fuzz which has clouded Mastodon's previous records is gone. This is how Mastodon should sound.  Most of Mastodon's signature sound is intact and in full effect. Heavy riffs abound, although not as hard hitting overall as Leviathan. Where Crack the Skye really shines is in its vocals. The vocals are split between Brent, Troy, and Brann, giving them plenty of variety. Brann's lyrics, although they only appear on the song \\"Oblivion\\", are incredibly suited to the music. It is one thing I hope to hear much more of from Mastodon in the future. The lyrics are very well written as well, making the story of the album very clear and atmospheric.  The guitars and drums are slower, more even and flowing than swelling and crashing. This is not to say that the unadulterated power of Mastodon is not present; the many solos of Crack the Skye are as imposing and beautiful as any.  In relation to their other albums, this one is one of the best. It doesn't dethrone Leviathan, but it surpasses Blood Mountain. It is focused, clear, and powerful, pushing Mastodon in a new direction exemplified by the Air element.  I can hardly wait to see what's in store with Fire.
B001P9KR94|5.0|SLUMDOG MILLIONAIRE<br /><br />**** ½ Out of 5<br /><br />Release Date- November 12th, 2008<br /><br />Running Time- 121-Minutes<br /><br />Rating- R<br /><br />Screenplay- Simon Beaufoy<br /><br />Director- Danny Boyle<br /><br />Starring- Dev Patel, Freida Pinto, Ayush Mahesh Khedekar, Rubiana Ali, Tanay Chheda, Ashutosh Lobo Gajiwala, Tanvi Ganesh Lonkar, Madhur Mittal<br /><br />Slumdog Millionaire took the film world by storm and won several Oscars, with major ones for best adapted screenplay, best director and the big one best picture. Slumdog Millionaire is the little movie that I'm sure not many expected to become the blockbuster hit it was and of course winning all the Oscars it did. There's a lot of hype on Slumdog and the good news is due to that people will see it; the downside is there's bound to be some backlash. What many people though are wondering does Slumdog Millionaire live up to all the hype? The answer is yes and no.<br /><br />Slumdog Millionaire is a great flick for sure and I would rate the movie as one of my favorites of 2008, but personally I don't think Slumdog is best picture good. I thought the movie was good enough, but there were some other movies I thought were a bit better and some weren't nominated, but despite that Slumdog Millionaire is a great flick and worthy of the praise, but don't get caught up too much with the hype because than you'll be bound to be disappointed. A lot of people have compared Slumdog Millionaire to Rocky due to the underdog vibe both movies have and that's where the strength of Slumdog comes from. Everybody loves an underdog story and I'm sure that in part is what helped Slumdog dominate the Oscars.<br /><br />The screenplay by Simon Beaufoy is very well written and the characters are rock solid; the main character is Jamal and we follow him through his life played by three different actors and I really liked the concept of that and I think that's what makes this movie so likeable to you follow the character around and see the tough life he has and it brings sympathy to him. Slumdog is sort of that movie that as you watch it you get more and more invested in the lives of these characters and any possible flaws you can find are more than made up for due to that.<br /><br />Danny Boyle has been a director who has had a nice following, but here with Slumdog Millionaire he's now a major player in Hollywood. Boyle does a great job with Slumdog and all the praise he's gotten for the movie is more than deserving; the pacing of Slumdog is excellent and the movie is always moving forward with the plot or characters. Boyle manages to grab the viewers' attention from the start and always keeps you invested in the life of Jamal and the other characters. Danny Boyle creates some truly deep and touching scenes and is able to really bring out a lot of different emotions while you watch the movie.<br /><br />The acting is solid from pretty much all the cast members and Dev Patel and Freida Pinto are both talents to watch for in the future. The character of Jamal played Ayush Mahesh Khedekar, Ashutosh Lobo Gajiwala and then by Dev Patel is a truly great character that you can get behind and root for and all three actors are excellent.<br /><br />Slumdog Millionaire is a great movie, but what elevates the movie is how we follow Jamal through different times in his life and that's what will hook the viewer and make us so invested in his life and how it will all turn out. Again Slumdog Millionaire is worthy of the praise it has gotten and worthy of it's best picture win even if it wouldn't be my top pick, but I highly recommend this movie. It's destined to become a classic.og is sort of that movie that as you watch it you get more and more invested in the lives of these characters and any possible flaws you can find are more than made up for due to that.

Boyle manages to grab the viewers' attention from the start and always keeps you invested in the life of Jamal and the other characters. Danny Boyle creates some truly deep and touching scenes and is able to really bring out a lot of different emotions while you watch the movie.    The acting is solid from pretty much all the cast members and Dev Patel and Freida Pinto are both talents to watch for in the future. The character of Jamal played Ayush Mahesh Khedekar, Ashutosh Lobo Gajiwala and then by Dev Patel is a truly great character that you can get behind and root for and all three actors are excellent.    Slumdog Millionaire is a great movie, but what elevates the movie is how we follow Jamal through different times in his life and that's what will hook the viewer and make us so invested in his life and how it will all turn out. Again Slumdog Millionaire is worthy of the praise it has gotten and worthy of it's best picture win even if it wouldn't be my top pick, but I highly recommend this movie. It's destined to become a classic.
B001K3JF7K|2.0|Shame on whoever woke Diana up from her nap to record this album. Did she even bother to sit upright when she was singing? Her earlier stuff was so spot-on perfect (\\"I Can't Give You Anything But Love,\\" for instance) that few singers have the power to disappoint me with mediocre singing that she does. She abused the power with this album. Lots of people get tired of their jobs after a while. Maybe she's just tired of hers.
B00000K44V|5.0|I spent my childhood following my older cousins around everywhere. They would take away my Partridge Family albums and make me listen to Mott the Hoople,Hendrix, Cream, Black Sabbath and of course Jethro Tull. This was a classic in their collection and it really took me back.  Thanx for making it available to me.  Ian Anderson offered me a beer backstage a few years back and I stood trembling in front of him. Greatness like that lasts forever.

0307450570|4.0|I love Martha Stewart's books, and am a life long craft-aholic, so I grabbed this FAST and ran to my nearest armchair. The crafts that are included, are quite good. However, so many crafts are not included at all, that I question how the book could possibly be an ENCYCLOPEDIA. If they had left out this word, I would have given them 5 stars for what is in the book, even though I personally don't consider Glittering (gluing glitter on things) to be a craft in itself- I would have called it Embellishing I think and made it a larger section.<br /><br />The section on candle making has some really wonderful ideas. For example using dyed egg shells to pour candles in and set on the table in egg holders or using lemons as containers for candles.  Techniques for how to dip, pour, roll, and make sand candles are included. Even how to make a candle mold and floating candles.<br /><br />The Botanical Pressing and Printing sections was simply amazing, the clay section was interesting and I wonder how those polymer clay buttons for kids clothes hold up in the washing machine. The soap making section was nice, with extras like bath salts, but they strictly stuck to the melt and pour sort of soap, instead of the much nicer and more difficult to make soaps that take trickier processing and about a month to be ready to use (but are so worth it).<br /><br />The Beading section was a small section of making little flowers and bugs with seed beads (they did included Beaded Jewelry under Jewelry Making but it is not terribly comprehensive). The Rope Craft section and the Etching Glass sections were very brief, as were several others, but what they had was neat and made me want to go buy Ropes and Etching Cream of all things.<br /><br />The book is gorgeous, and a lot of fun, especially if you entertain a lot and need to make super cool Place Cards (has not happened yet at my house). And yes, it is inspiring as well. My main issue however, is not what is in here, but what is NOT in here. What about Antiquing Furniture, Basket Making, Crochet, Knitting, Weaving, Rug Making, Doll Making, Sewing, Macrame, Gourd Art, Glass Art, Stained Glass, and on and on I could go. The criteria for what was including is puzzling. A better title would have been Martha Stewart's Crafts V.I, and then hope for a V. II soon!, Basket Making, Crochet, Knitting, Weaving, Rug Making, Doll Making, Sewing, Macrame, Gourd Art, Glass Art, Stained Glass, and on and on I could go.

0575081244|4.0|This is Mickey Spilane in the future. It has all of the elements of a hard-boiled detective story and a cyberpunk action novel--but written in a near erudite fashion. I say this because the narrator writes everyone in a matter-of-fact, professional manner. All of the words expressed by Takeshi Kovacs can seriously make you believe this world is real, that it exists in sight, sound, touch, taste, and feel. That is a talent that makes me tip my hat to the author. Well done.     Aside from that, the novel is very complex (for a detective thriller). You really have to pay attention to the details or you'll get lost. Even when things are explained, I found myself saying, \\"Wait a minute--...oh...oh, yeah!...I get it.\\" Even though the book is short in page length (my copy was about 376 pages), it turned out to be a long read. There was just a lot to absorb in spite of it being a relatively action-packed novel.     Anyway, it was something I enjoyed, and something I would highly recommend.

0930289234|4.0|I've been enjoying this trend that started a while back in which Super Heroes and Masked Avengers are portrayed in film and television as being flawed, human, selfish, emotional, paranoid, destructive, and all of those other attributes that usually bring out the worse in us.<br /><br />I feel like Watchmen is the apex of that movement away from the likes of Superman (the American Way) to the single-handed retribution of the Punisher and Wolverine. There are real situations explored in the Watchmen that to this date may not be completely acceptable in how we see masked avengers and super heroes. Nevertheless, the real unraveling yarn here is the exploration of the different pasts shared by this fraternity of masked heroes; and how their lives have played together and apart for better or for worse. There is real character development here that should not disappoint.<br /><br />Speaking of disappointments, my only complaint would be the rushed ending: the god in the mechanics that appear without real explanation as to how (expect they were indeed [note sarcasm] developed by the Smartest Man in the World) everything was executed so easily, with such devastating use of high technology... However, the outcome, the logical outcome of the weird deus ex machina was quite the unexpected twist.<br /><br />I recently saw the remade film The Day the Earth Stood Still, and there is a matter of observation spoken within: something along the lines of man often does his best when on the brink. Since hearing that, I have noticed its sad truth and perception. The novel Watchmen does just that: throws a huge mass of individuals into the brink, and because of that, the impossible--for this alternate timeline--happens. The result is alien, extraordinary, and very much needed for the current situation... The realization is how sad that it really, truly had to come down to just that.

B006WXHJNU|5.0|Universal and Marvel have succeeded with this &#34;Incredible&#34; action-packed reboot! Edward Norton is perfectly cast as Dr. Banner. His acting and mannerisms strongly resembled the late Bill Bixby. The fight scene between Hulk and the Abomination was absolutely EPIC!! There is an exciting moment in the film in which the &#34;green goliath,&#34; voiced by none other than Lou Ferrigno, utters his famous catchphrase &#34;Hulk.... SMASH!!&#34; Better casting, a well written plot, similarities to the old CBS TV series and a soundtrack brilliantly composed by Craig Armstrong makes this worth watching again and again.

B0012GMVXU|5.0|As an album that you hear when your parents play it and come back to later to realise it's simply amazing, you can't get much better than this. Leonard Cohen is an amazing man, who has created an amazing number of amazing songs over the year. For me, though, this is his essential album. Partly it's because my parents played it over and over when it first came out, and when I was too young to understand music like this for all its depth. I came back to it about five years ago to find that not only does it contain breathtaking songs, but I didn't have to wait a while to gain familiarity with them.     There isn't really time or space to go into detail about why each song is great, but suffice it to say that from the brooding Everybody Knows, to the wonderful 3/4 timed Take This Waltz, to the majestic closer Tower of Song, and everything in between, these are songs for all occasions. It'll take a bit of time - you'll need that familiarity that my parents bred into me before you fully appreciate this - and you'll at times have to look past the rather 80s synthetic instruments and the incredible blip of mediocre that is Jazz Police, but this album is magical.     Cohen's voice, his lyrics, and over all the craftsmanship and scale of his songs make this a truly excellent album. And one I can't rate highly enough!
B001U9BRNE|4.0|I did not think much of Bocelli before, but with his three songs here, he just blew me and my wife away.  He sang as if he had a power amplifier hidden somewhere inside his body.  The audience's reaction said it all.  Peter Cetera, performing just before Bocelli and himself an incredible singer, just shook his head and sighed that it was tough being in the same room with Bocelli warming up.     I bought the DVD, and I am going to buy the Blu-ray.  For once, my wife encourages me to double dip.

1416914285|2.0|Without being too spoilery, I'll simply say that this book seems to have gone to print without the benefit of any editing whatsoever, borrows heavily from other (better) novels, and uses so many soap opera-grade ploys to create tension out of thin air that I half expected Clary to wake up at the end of the novel and discover it had all been a dream. The characters are flat and unengaging; their personality traits are assigned to them outright rather than being revealed to the reader through the use of skillful writing. The whole thing is an exercise in rote cliches.    Eh, I've already devoted more time to this review than the book warrants. Suffice it to say, I won't bother with the rest of the series.
B001PPLIEQ|3.0|Quantum Solace is an above average action flick, but it is not on par with Casino Royale or the Bourne movies. I think that the film relies too much on spectacle and setting rather than character and plot. At its best, the film shows why Daniel Craig is such a perfect choice for a hardnosed Bond. With all respect to Roger Moore, Timothy Dalton, and Pierce Brosnan, none of them looks like he can take a kick in the ribs, much less dish one out. The film's two best moments are the fight in the Haitian hotel--which is fast and brutal, not staged and spectacular--and the 30 seconds when Craig is topless and we see the scars and bruises on his body. No previous Bond as ever made being battered look good. The rest of the film is globetrotting and lavish action pieces that never sizzle the way the Haitian hotel fight sizzles. Perhaps it is artistic to intercut a chase with an Italian horse race and a gunfight with an Austrian opera, but it is not compelling and does not fit with this new, tougher Bond. I also think that the film misses an opportunity to reveal more character. When M tells Bond that his seductive charm has been lethal to several undeserving people, we never see his full emotional response. I wanted to see him struggle with that insight.    Overall, the Bond series is proceeding in the right direction. In my opinion, Craig is the best Bond of them all. I also like how the films spotlight the relationship between M and Bond. So far, M has mostly reined in Bond; in the next film, I would like to see her unleash him. Maybe she's nearly killed or she loses her position, and she tells Bond to make her assailants pay. Imagine the carnage.    I think that the new Bond movies have a chance to be more than the campy action movies that starred Moore, Dalton, and Brosnan. They have the right actors and the right ideas. Look at The Dark Knight: If a comic book movie can aspire to film art, so can a Bond movie. I would like to see Craig win an Academy Award for Bond.
B0002V7O3S|5.0|Even though this is supposed to be a fictionalized account of an actual event and adds Hollywood special effects where very little may actually exist in the real life drama, it is nonetheless an exceptionally entertaining and well done movie.  The acting is top notch, the storytelling is captivating, the special effects are very effective.  I saw this movie years ago, remembered it as being a movie worthy of owning, and wasn't disappointed when I picked it up and my wife & I watched it.  A very entertaining movie...  -kd5-

B001K3JF7K|3.0|OK, so maybe that's a little harsh, but there's definitely something overly processed and, well, cheesy about Diana Krall's latest.  Maybe it's the Bee Gees cover, or the Mantovani strings, but this is Easy Listening, pure and simple (or Sleepy Listening, given the dirge-like tempos); it certainly isn't jazz.  And that's fine, I suppose, if, like Velveeta, it's what you're in the mood for.  But I've come to expect something far more interesting and distinct from Ms. Krall, and there's nothing of that in this risk-free collection.  I don't share other reviewers' qualms about her vocal stylings here; to me she sounds the same as she ever has.  And, let's face it, folks, Ms. Krall's appeal has never been about what a great singer she is.  I mean, Ella she ain't.  But she is a talent, and one whose past efforts have been far more entertaining and vibrant.  In this instance, I'm afraid, \\"Quiet\\" equates to dull and uneventful.
0226443221|5.0|Heat Wave was one of the required readings for my class on medical sociology, and it is almost single-handedly responsible for sparking my interest in public health. Klinenberg takes an in-depth look at the patterns of decay underlying what seemed to be isolated and exceptional deaths, and in doing so, at the role of community and society in health.<br />He manages to combine methodological discussion, neighborhood history, statistics, personal accounts, and sociology into a narrative of a local disaster that goes beyond the news stories and the simple assumptions that can be made about a string of hot days. It's a thought-provoking read, especially for anyone interested in public health or on the front lines of healthcare.
0783231202|3.0|When I saw this film in the theater, I was confused, distracted and annoyed by the constant MUSIC that runs through this movie. It's not even a soundtrack, but the never-ending emotion-drenching strings; by the time you get to the courtroom scene with Anthony Hopkins, you'll wish for subtitles. Three stars is almost reaching because I want this movie redone!
B000006UD8|5.0|Deep Purple first caught my notice when I was in junior high school with the issue of Shades of Deep Purple. By the time I was in high school, Machine Head had been issued and had etched their name in music history as one of the top bands of the burgeoning hard rock scene. Machine Head was the backdrop for many a wild party and today it still sounds as fresh and compelling as it was back then.  The Machine Head limited edition set is certainly the one to get. Not only do you get the original album remastered with a bonus track and some quadrophonic mixes thrown in, you also get Roger Glover's remix of the original album plus a bonus cut. And that remix is well worth having.  I liked Machine Head from the start and my favorites from back in the day remain my favorites today. Those are: the wildly energetic Highway Star, the soaring Pictures of Home, Lazy, and the relentless Space Truckin'. One aspect of this that makes it an outstanding value is that there is no filler, just first class high octane rock and roll.  Machine Head is one of those proverbial \\"desert island\\" discs, so if you are looking to upgrade or if you are buying for the first time, the moment is right to buy this edition at an obscenely cheap price from an amazon partner as I did. The set is accompanied by an attractive and informative 27 page booklet that only adds value. If you don't have this yet, you owe it to yourself and to your progeny to add it to your music library.

B001PPLIEQ|5.0|Quantum of Solace is a direct sequel to Casino Royale.  In the movie Bond discovers the existence of Quantum, is introduced to his longtime CIA friend Felix, and further develops his trust relationship with \\"M\\" (Julie Dent).  The movie is filled with nonstop action, car chases, shooting.<br /><br />The movie starts off right where Casio Royale left off and quickly introduces bond to Quantum (Spectre anyone?) and Bond is quickly whisked away to Haiti, South America, Italy, London and a slurry of exotic locales that is so typical of Bond.<br /><br />I found this installment gritty with a Bond which is decidedly more thuglike than the debonaire Connery or Brosnan but most certainly Daniel Craig as Bond is much more in tune with what today's audience demands of the character and the fact that there are so many homages paid to the original bond that it will keep traditionalists connected to the old bond.<br /><br />Overall, a solid outting.

B000AP04MO|5.0|This movie is timeless.  It is beautifully written, photograghed, directed.    The acting is second to none.  Audrey Hepburn and Albert Finney are completely  convincing as a long time married couple whose marriage is not always perfect.  Their characters show vulnerability and the insecurity that often goes with real life relationships.  They positively sizzle on screen and are both a delight to watch, their persons and their acting.  The locales make it that much more beautiful, the gorgeous countryside in the south of France.  What's not to love?  It is a poignant love story about the enduring bonds of a loving relationship.

031606792X|2.0|I don't want to go on and on because I feel like a lot of my thoughts on this book are paralleled and discussed by other reviewers.  At this point, it should be clear to anyone reading the reviews that the plot is a huge let down, a disappointment, the characters dismaying, the pregnancy and birth issue revolting, and Edward loses any appeal he may have had in the previous books.    The first novel, Twilight, I enjoyed immensely.  Although I realized at the time, of course, that the writing was sub-par and that already Bella was whiney, selfish and annoying (I still can't understand why a group of 100+ year old vampires would take such a liking to an immature, highschool brat) I still fell in love with the whole forbidden love thing.    Maybe the series should have stopped there.  Or at New Moon.  I don't know, but Breaking Dawn was such an abomanation! No development! No character develops or has to change in any way!  Happy endings for all!  I mean, this garbage is worse than a Disney movie; even Belle had some serious struggles before she and the Beast got it on.    I read the book cover to cover in one night, not because I couldn't put it down, but because I just wanted to GET THROUGH it.  Find out what happens.  But the whole book is pointless, it just leads you to a denouement that is unsatisfying, uninteresting and unexciting.  The Volturi back down.  Everyone is happy, from selfish Bella to pedophile Jacob [...]    But beside this novel lacking EVERYTHING that makes a book good-- not even what makes literature good--what makes a BOOK good-- a BOOK, the number one thing I took from it was how disappointed I was that Meyer is the author of this series.  There could have been so much good to come from these books, better plotlines, better characters, BETTER WRITING!!, better themes, more intricate relationships..yada yada yada!  She could have done sooo SOO SOOOOO much more and didn't.  Wish I had come up with the idea, or anyone really.  Anyone with half a brain, a little creativity, and a varied command of the English language (is hiss really the only synonym for snarl?) could have produced a tolerable piece of fiction.    Sigh.

0679731377|5.0|[[ASIN:0679731377 A History of the World in 10 1/2 Chapters]]<br />Julian Barnes has said that his mother claimed she did not understand some of his books.  This must be one she had in mind.  It is brilliant, but in some respects difficult to fathom.  I missed it when it was first published, but was led back to it by my appreciation of Barnes' recent memoir, Nothing to Be Frightened Of.<br /><br />Start with the question of how to classify the \\"10½  Chapters.\\"  \\"Short stories\\" seems mostly accurate, but there are unifying themes and references that tie many of the entries together.  Nor is the volume entirely fiction, for it includes an essay on love, art criticism, and other interjected commentaries.  It sits comfortably in no standard genre.<br /><br />The book begins riotously with a woodworm's view of life on Noah's Ark.  The narrator, one of seven stowaway representatives of Anobium domesticum, fills in lots of useful information not revealed in the Bible, such as what happened to the unicorn (Noah and his family ate him).  In the final chapter (story) the narrator (a male human dreamer, not a woodworm this time) is in heaven passing several centuries into the future and can get anything he wants.  In large part that entails eating good breakfasts three times per day, meeting many famous people, having frequent and varied sex, and playing golf - think of Nietzsche's \\"last man.\\"  Some hint of where this story leads is provided by the protagonist's concern that even though he has perfected his game he will never be able to reduce his golf score below 18.<br /><br />In between we experience a modern Mediterranean ship hijacking, a trial in early sixteenth-century France, a contemporary sea adventure off Australia, an 1816 shipwreck, two expeditions to Mt. Ararat seeking signs of Noah's Ark (1840s and 1970s), Jewish refugees fleeing Nazi Germany by ship in 1939, variations on Jonah and the whale, and a modern-day filmmaking project in the Amazon.  Noah and the woodworms reappear in various roles across several of these stories and several involve escapes, often water voyages.<br /><br />Few writers today are as satirically clever as Barnes and much of the \\"10½  Chapters\\" is very funny.  For instance, the chapter (story) on the early sixteenth century trial features our friends the woodworms again.  They are the defendants, their offense having been that they ate into the wooden legs of the Bishop's throne at the local church, causing the Bishop to take a pratfall before the congregation.  The punishment sought by the prosecution is excommunication of the woodworms.  The defense lawyer is most adept.  He argues, for instance, that his clients are not endowed with reason, that they did only what God made them for, that the true culprits must have been earlier generations since woodworms do not live very long, and so on, all a good send-up of the kinds of arguments lawyers still make today.<br /><br />Yet Barnes has more serious purposes too.  Among his themes are observations about how stories transform as they are retold through history, how untruths hold power, and how myths adjust over time so that they are not so much about something in the past as about what will happen in the future. Barnes plays on the sometimes narrow or indiscernible gap between fact and fiction.  History is only what historians tell us, Barnes suggests, but even though objective truth is not fully attainable, we must believe that it is and take what we can get.  At least I think that is what he would have told his mother, if asked.roles across several of these stories and several involve escapes, often water voyages.

This \\"new\\" old Cohen is full of spirit, vivacious and with a twinkle in the eye. The music has been completely re-arranged and sounds better than ever.

I am Bohm's biggest critic when it comes to his thick molasses approach to the symphonies, etc...but not here! This is by far the darkest rendition available due to pacing and the rich tonal qualities that totally envelop the listener. And of course it is all appropriate. The opening movements are totally seductive, evoking a morbid trance-like state. But the movements are not so slow as to disorient you from rhythmic patterns...Bohm stresses every critical syllable while maintaning perfect time.  Maybe other interpretations are closer to Mozart's intentions with regard to tempi, but none are so  truly frightening. Play it loudly and revel in the greatest death mass ever written!
B001P9KR8U|1.0|I have heard so many compliments about this movie in the last few months that I could not wait for it to come out on Blu ray so I can go and rent it.  So ,today March 31st it came out officially so I ran into my video store to rent it before all copies get rented out.Luckily ,there was one left.  I ran home turned on my TV started watching and then dissapointment...    Here is why;  Anybody remembers 1990 movie called Time of the Gypsies?  TOTG is a movie about gypsie boy from Eastern Europe,moving to Italy in order to earn enough money as a beggar, so he can return home and marry his sweetheart.  Well, Slumdog borrows heavily from TOTG which made it famous;  the fork,the hot peper scene,the evil brother scene,brother having relationship with his girl scene,the mother gets killed scene,under bridge scene,stealing babies scene,the blind beggar kid scene,the train scene,the richman in the car scene,...and list goes on.    In fact upon further inspection I can safely say that Slumdog is \\"updated\\" and \\"softened\\" version of TOTG with \\"Who wants to be a millionaire\\" plot.    Do yourself a favour and watch the real masterpiece about Slumdog lifestyle;Time of the Gypsies.
0062515675|5.0|I've read number of books on self-help. This book would be at the top of my recommendation list. The first few pages are boring and mediocre. The conversations could have been better. Story-telling isn't great. But what I like and appreciate most is the priceless wisdom it presents. Enjoyable and life-changing.
014241011X|5.0|I almost forgot about this book from my childhood.     I remember having it read to me from my teacher in elementary school and being terrified at the \\"witches\\".     It was made into a movie years later with I believe Anjelica Houston as the \\"head\\" witch. I thought it was done pretty well considering.     Great book!
B001K3JF7K|5.0|This Album is what people are waiting for, very relaxing music even there are couple songs that dont fit the Mood of the Album , the 1st song is very nice , this remind you of the Look of love kind of sound , with the Orchestra in the background , song # 10 is very good , in general , it 's a should buy album , because there are not good music out there anyway , even this is not her best !

B0017VG69U|5.0|Most of my favorite Star Trek episodes are in Season Two, and that is why I purchased it.  The stories are well-written, directed and acted.  The remastering was extremely well done, and the updated special effects are awesome.  If you can get only one Season at a time (like me), this is the Season to start with!
B000SCHBGQ|5.0|this is one of the best books i ever read the others being the other 2 books inthis stunning seriese i think the details were stunning and that the plot based on  actual things is nothing less then geniuse. i give my highest recomendation to this book
B001NERPHS|1.0|This release was a bad project in 1975, 8 years after the songs were recorded. If SONY cannot include the masterpiece of the basement tapes, \\"I Shall Be Released\\" in this remaster, they should not have done it at all. This is insane. The two CDs could easily have include 40 songs from the sessions. Take out the Band-only songs and this CD pair is less than half of what it should have been
B001O9CBG2|5.0|As C. S. Lewis himself said children's stories that are only for children aren't worth reading--or words to that effect.

B0017R5UAA|5.0|There's something about Seattle that brings out creative individuality like no place else.  Fleet Foxes' sound is a mix of everything I like: acoustic folk, rock, Baroque, excellent harmony.    You could have heard them in the Sixties....  You could have heard them in a Renaissance Court...    It's hard to pick a favorite among the eleven offerings here.  \\"White Winter Hymnal\\" was what got me to make the purchase, but every time I listen another song gets put on repeat.  I've never skipped a single number.      If you like folk, baroque, acoustic, just plain good music, at least sample what's offered on their page.  You will probably end up hooked, too.    Rebecca Kyle, April 2009
B0002IVN9W|4.0|Not many debuts made such a sonic claim to new generation indie supremacy like the obvious frames around Funeral. Coming out like an effortless concoction of excellent prior-generation groups like Modest and Pixies with a slightly more informed, and certainly wider ranging, musical bite, is that often needed reminder disc to proclaim why you in fact started enjoying this genre. Of course anthemic heights scaled can only occur so often, unfortunately, but a certain level of consistency is met to deserve at least some of its immense praise.
0930289234|5.0|The book came in perfect condition thanks to the careful wrapping. It was amazing! The U.S. Postal Service never really takes good care of parcels and they made sure it was packaged extra durable! It also came in on time and I was able to complete the novel before the movie came out. THANKS SO MUCH!
B001CTDH4Y|1.0|We purchased this movie as our son loves talking dog movies. He found it boring. I thought the theme of dogfighting was not fit for a children's movie. Disappointing.
B001QB9H10|4.0|Transporter 3 is a exactly what you think it is. It is a very good-looking action film, riddled with cliches. This time around, Jason Statham gets to karate-chop thugs working for a hood blackmailing a Ukranian politician. He kidnaps the politician's daughter (played by real life Natasha, Natalya Rudakova) to force him to allow a shipment of toxic waste into his country.          Statham is forced to drive Miss Broken English of 2008 around so the cops won't find her. Like the last Transporter film, a bomb is involved. This time its strapped to Statham's wrist to keep him in the car, driving. And there is alot of driving in Transporter 3, along with explosions, shooting and many well choreographed fight scenes. All in all, Transporter 3 is a pretty much what I expected, a good but somewhat mindless diversion.

B000002H2H|5.0|Out of all the metal albums I've listend to over the years. Ride the Lightning is got to be at least number 2 on my top 5 I rank it way before Master of Puppets I love Master but it became so overated. But if you really wanna listen to a good Metallica album then I really suggest this one. The solos, the lyrics, the drum beats everything on this album gets me pumped up. If I'm working out this album is definatelly on for me to get going. for pple who don't like this album your either high on something or you don't like metal at all. And one of my most favorite songs of all time is on this album. And that is \\"For Whom The Bell Tolls\\" I just absoloutely love that song. and \\"Fight Fire With Fire\\" I just wanna mosh when I hear this song. And \\"Fade to Black\\" I love this song because it was played at my cousins funeral which is basically what made me pick up this album. R.I.P. Tyler well that's all I got to say I hope my review was helpful to people out there.

B00003CX8Y|4.0|This is a wonderful movie for the whole family.  I got this for my 3 year-old daughter, but it was ultimately my 5 year-old son who was glued to the movie.  This movie came out when I was in high school, and it was great to watch it again.
B001DEVZUG|5.0|Annie Lennox has one of the greatest Rock & Roll voices of our time.<br /><br />The videos are amazing. She should try acting.
B0000E2FLC|2.0|Gave this a two because of the songs. The video on this DVD is very poor. I don't even think that the sound is from the actual concert. If you watch everyone playing and listen to the sound, their movements don't match up with the music. I guess if you were going to order this, you'd want to get the Blu-ray so you'd at least have a better video (although I haven't seen the Blu-ray, I'd imagine it would be crisper). If you just want to listen to some songs, and see the band along with those songs, then get this DVD. If you want a realistic experience, skip this product.
B000005GW2|5.0|Chet Baker had a voice that was very easy on the ear; and that voice of his also had just a touch of vulnerability to make it very special to his adoring audiences. Chet sings some very good numbers on this album and that's grand. Russ Freeman's musicians don't let us down, either! The quality of the sound is excellent and I really like that artwork, too.<br /><br />\\"That Old Feeling\\" has Chet singing rather sweetly; he delivers this with panache and I'm impressed. \\"That Old Feeling\\" gets a rather jazzy arrangement and it works very well for Chet's rendition of this ballad. I always liked \\"That Old Feeling;\\" and Chet makes it sound very fresh and new. Great! \\"Like Someone In Love\\" gets a very sensitive treatment from Chet who sings this to perfection and beyond! Chet never sings a superfluous note; and the piano arrangement is very elegant as well. \\"My Ideal\\" uses the percussion very nicely; and Chet delivers this well. Chet handles complex key and tempo changes like the pro he always was--and he's right there front and center, too.<br /><br />\\"I've Never Been In Love Before\\" is yet another most romantic tune that Chet infuses with great emotion as he wears his heart on his sleeve; and I really like \\"My Buddy.\\" How's about that horn solo? In addition, \\"But Not For Me\\" shines bright; Chet swings gently to make this number a standout on the album and I could never tire of hearing Chet perform \\"But Not For Me.\\"<br /><br />\\"I Get Along Without You Very Well (Except Sometimes)\\" is a very tender ballad; that xylophone works well and Chet sings this faultlessly. Chet uses that vulnerability in his voice to really make his performance all the better. Of course, \\"My Funny Valentine\\" is a major highlight of this album; Chet delivers this as only a true master ever could. Chet's incredible sense of timing amazes me and the gentle music that goes along fits in perfectly with Chet's vocals.<br /><br />\\"The Thrill Is Gone\\" has Chet Baker squarely front and center--right where he belongs! I really like \\"The Thrill Is Gone;\\" Chet performs this wonderfully and that horn makes the music very beautiful. \\"I Fall In Love Too Easily\\" shines brighter than silver and gold when Chet sings it; and the album ends very well with Chet Baker performing a very classic pop vocal entitled \\"Look For The Silver Lining.\\" \\"Look For The Silver Lining\\" gets an upbeat melody and the tempo is just right for this ballad. Chet aces this last tune as effortlessly as if it were just breathing. Of course, it really wasn't that easy; but Chet's talents always carried him through.<br /><br />Chet Baker fans will want this CD; it really highlights his fine talents as a singer in particular. This is also a great starter CD for people just discovering the artistry of the great Chet Baker.rill Is Gone;\\" Chet performs this wonderfully and that horn makes the music very beautiful. \\"I Fall In Love Too Easily\\" shines brighter than silver and gold when Chet sings it; and the album ends very well with Chet Baker performing a very classic pop vocal entitled \\"Look For The Silver Lining.\\" \\"Look For The Silver Lining\\" gets an upbeat melody and the tempo is just right for this ballad.

B001PPF130|5.0|I Love this CD! I was surprised at how good the CD sounds! The first release of this CD sounds a little heavy in the bass end and seems to be mixed a lot better this time. I won't review anything from the original Cd as you should already be familiar with those. The bonus songs on this edition are amazing! I have a few of them from some imports but It is nice having them all on one CD.My favs from the second disk are: Polyethylene (Parts 1 & 2) [Paranoid Android], A Reminder, Pearly*, and especially Climbing Up The Walls (Zero 7 Mix) [Karma Police] Zero 7 being one of the most overlooked bands was great to see in collaboration with Radiohead! The movies are cool and the postcards are....well postcards. Not to sure what I will do with them. They have nice artwork on them.<br />Bottom line, If you like the original OK Computer you will love this and should get it while it is still less than $30
B000L53D4O|4.0|My son (who is now almost 6) had this walker when he was about a year old. He LOVED to push it around. The toys on the front didn't hold his attention for long, he mainly just walked around with it. As with all of the toys in the Fisher Price \\"Brilliant Basics\\" line, it is very simple. Light weight, almost cheap plastic, no lights or gizmos. But it held up well and served it's purpose.
B001GZ6QBU|5.0|Heath Ledger is the movie.<br />Outstanding performance as The Joker.<br /><br />For years I thought that Jack Nicholson's fifteen minute role in Batman was one of the best pieces of acting I'd ever seen.

B0015DROBO|5.0|but learning all the Swedish names, reading everything there is to know about Sweden's financial markets/institutions and trying to keep all the names of every Vanger family member straight (must be 100 of them!) was just a tad too much for my pea-sized brain. It was very, very tough to make it through the first few chapters, but I stayed with it and am glad I did.<br /><br />If you can make it through the first few chapters, it's an excellent book. I can't wait to read \\"The Girl Who Played With Fire\\" coming out in July. I'm hoping it will be available for the Kindle! The story of Lisbeth was left WIDE open. The next book should be even better after what she did!<br /><br />If you're a Kindler and want to read \\"The Girl Who Played With Fire\\" on your Kindle, go to \\"The Girl Who Played With Fire\\" page and click on \\"I want to read this book on my Kindle\\"...it's on the left side of the page.
B001OBT3FC|5.0|This celebratory concert(100th anniversary of Karajan's birth)recorded at the dazzling Golden hall of Vienna's Musikverein on 28 Jan 2008, is arguably the best concert disc on Blu ray that I've seen so far. Featuring Anne Sophie Mutter in stunning form musically, playing Beethoven's violin concerto, the work with which she has performed more times with her late mentor Karajan than any other work,and supported by the Berliners in sparkling form,with immaculate conducting from Seiji Ozawa, this is a must have for music lovers. Yes one may have heard the Beethoven a hundred times but when performed with such panache and virtuosity,one hears it again afresh. The picture quality is first class and the recorded audio in PCM 5.1  is brilliant with great dynamic range and a surround ambience that almost makes one feel one were in a concert hall. In the larghetto Mutter coaxed the most amazing tones from her instrument and with lucid accompaniment from the woodwinds particularly the bassoon this was a movement to cherish. This is a lush and romantic reading , the soloist relishing in the musical nuances of this Mount Everest of violin concertos. The final movement too is played with great aplomb. The solo violin Partita( Sarabande) by JS Bach was a refreshing sorbet before the next major work, Tchaikovsky's Pathetique Symphony, and here too one sees Ozawa urging the BPO in a dramatic account with exciting sonic dynamics very well recorded . How the audience responded. What a concert . If you buy just one music disc this year, buy this one!
B001PPLIEG|1.0|Background: For me, Daniel Craig is a very good Bond: He brings an intensity and physicality to the role that is good fit to the current version of the character (action hero, special ops, not English gentleman).<br /><br />All of the action sequences were not just disappointing, but boring.  The opening car chase didn't have any elements that hadn't appeared countless times before.  And the frenetic cutting created emotional detachment (I felt I was watching it from a distance, rather than in the middle of it).  Similarly for the foot chase (Casino Royale's was infinitely superior).  The airplane chase is so much less than what appeared in earlier Bond movies.  For sophistication and elements, I would place it in the 1970s--lacking the innovations of the 1973 TV movie [[ASIN:B000A3454Y Birds of Prey]] that was the aerial classic until [[ASIN:B0002WZTOI Top Gun]] in 1986.<br /><br />The exploding building insulted the audience's intelligence: No one would build a hotel where a small fire would be able to cascade to engulf the whole building within minutes. From the story, it appeared that the fuel was hydrogen (which has a very characteristic flame), but what was portrayed was the generic exploding building that you have seen in so, so many movies. The only unique aspect was the architecture, which counts for nothing.<br /><br />No plot: not enough plot points for this movie to qualify.<br /><br />No villain: Greene is just banal, but not even \\"the banality of evil\\".  It's a \\"paint-by-number\\" role that resulted from the writer inserting a placeholder and forgetting to come back and fill it out.<br /><br />Cardboard characters: Casino Royale showed a more complex Bond. The script provides little opportunity for Daniel Craig to repeat, much less expand on that.  The substitute is a bad guy telling Bond \\"You are both damaged goods\\".<br /><br />And M repeatedly condemns Bond without even bothering to ask what happened.  The formula is that M highly values Bond because of his ability to get results but is exasperated by some of his means to those ends.  This movie omits the former until the very end (a totally unmotivated change).<br /><br />The killing of Strawberry Fields is the most telling instance of lack of understanding of the formula: The woman to be killed by the villain is a close associate of his--typically a mistress, but the wife in [[ASIN:B000RPCK1U TND]]--who has been seduced by Bond into betraying him. Fields is not that, and her role was too innocuous to warrant a targeted sadistic killing (she was a MI-6/SIS clerical support person sent to be a minder for Bond).<br /><br />Why 1 star? For a random film, being annoyed, but not deeply offended, by having my time wasted rates 2 stars, but I expect a higher standard from this franchise.  But it was more than a waste: This movie left me with a very bad \\"aftertaste\\" that I can't really describe, but which several friends said that they too felt.by some of his means to those ends.

B00092ZMDY|5.0|We are long-time Eagles fans but this is the first DVD of a concert that we have owned. It belongs in every collection! We have watched it over and over and never seem to tire of it. They do plenty of their oldies and also give each member of the group time to be featured. Includes interesting interviews with each of the guys. I would definitely recommend this DVD. Appeals to all ages.
B0014DFCMS|4.0|\\"Juno\\" is a tarted-up Afterschool Special for the 21st century.  Surprisingly, it works.  It's not groundbreaking, or worth all the hype, but it's entertaining, and that's all that really matters.  And at 90 minutes, it avoids the cardinal sin of outlasting its welcome.<br /><br />I never thought Jennifer Garner was a good actress, but she is excellent in this film.  I don't know if it was the direction or the script, but she walks the knife edge between being sympathetic and domineering perfectly.  And Jason Bateman plays a different character than he usually does.  Sadly, for fans of Arrested Development, he doesn't have a single scene with Michael Cera.  Cera isn't in this movie very much, but he is great whenever he's in a scene.  Who would have thought he would turn out to be the big breakout movie star of Arrested Development?<br /><br />On the downside, the dialogue is often a bit too cutesy and precious for its own good, especially toward the beginning of the movie.  And, like all movies with teenagers, the characters don't act like real teenagers.  Nonetheless, my wife (who works at a high school) says that \\"Juno\\" gets closer than a lot of movies to what teenagers are actually like.<br /><br />I'd recommend \\"Juno\\" as a rental.  It's worth seeing, but you're unlikely to want to add this to your permanent collection.
1400077915|2.0|Runaway is the first book of short stories by Alice Munro I've read. I'd just finished reading Now & Then by Frederick Buechner so Ms. Munro's writing style suffered sadly in comparison. I'm sorry but Now and Then, an autobio by Buechner lingered in my memory long after I finished. If Ms. Munro is the best and brightest short story writer we have on the North American continent, we are in trouble, literarily speaking. I saw the usual gushy reviews claiming Ms. Munro is another Faulkner and is likened other Southern greats. I don't see it. I'm sorry. I'm not sure what I'm missing here but the characters of her stories seem pale, smaller than life, restrained and yes, a bit trite. Perhaps her writing is understated and subtle. I was wrong to try to find passion in the trilogy of Juliet. She seemed a bit of a yawn and easily dismissed. Is this what Ms. Munro intended? I'm not sure. Try Ron Rash is you want to read a passionate, lyric Southern short story writer who is a new star in the Southern sky.

B0016HNOXQ|2.0|Perhaps I liked them too much?  Or my expectations were too high?  Or perhaps I am becoming (have become) a grumpy old man.  And in support of the case for my own prosecution; I thought that Radiohead's \\"OK Computer\\" was a very poor follow-up to their previous work, which probably puts me into a group of one!    As with OK C, I have really tried to like P's 3rd, but just cannot.  And you know there is a problem when you try to like an album!   The recording seems laboured and just trying too much to be different, or challenging or avant-garde, or some such similar.  Now that is my personal taste, of course, and I can fully understand someone desiring a more challenging third album. If you are a commited Portishead fan, and that is what you are looking for, great, if not; caveat emptor!

B001P50HOI|5.0|Yes was one of the first \\"prog\\" bands in the 70's to marry the worlds of Rock and Classical. Finally, we get to hear them the way many fans have always thought they were meant to be heard... backed by a full symphony orchestra!

If you love Yes, you won't be disappointed with this.
B00027JYLC|5.0|In the early 1930s, Hollywood had discovered the monster movie and the monster movie was all the rage.  Dracula, Frankenstein, the Mummy, and many other monsters like them were huge at the box office.  At the time, Tod Browning was a hugely successful silent film director who had a major film hit with DRACULA.  Browning had been trying for several years to adapt a short story, Tod Robbins' \\"Spurs\\", into a feature film with Lon Chaney scheduled to appear.  However, it took the success of DRACULA before Browning was finally given the go.<br /><br />FREAKS was a huge success at it's initial screening in San Diego, but the movie was so unusual for its time (instead of fictional monsters the film was filled with real-life human oddities) that many found it squeamish and frightening and the studio pulled the film and had it re-edited.  The movie found some critical success and was very popular in some cities, but overall the film was critically panned.  Critics and many viewers found the sideshow setting of the film, with Siamese twins, armless women, pinheads, bearded ladies, dwarves, and a limbless man to be just too unnatural.  It was banned in many cities across the U.S. as well as in Britain and Australia and MGM pulled the film from circulation.  Fueled by a spirit of rebellion, the movie had a renaissance in the 1960s which continued for over thirty years until the film being added to the National Film Registry by the National Film Preservation Board in 1994.<br /><br />The basic plot of the film revolves around the dwarf Hans (Harry Earles) and his serious infatuation for a regular-sized female trapeze artist named Cleopatra (Olga Baclanova).  Hans is engaged to a female dwarf, Frieda (Daisy Earles--Harry's sister in real life), but when Cleo joins their circus, he becomes obsessed with her beauty.  Cleo encourages Hans' advances, but really just thinks of him as a toy to play with, even making fun of him with other \\"normal\\" people at the circus behind his back.  Cleo's real lover is the strong man Hercules (Henry Victor), who makes his living lousing upon wealthy women.  Though Cleo isn't rich, Hans treats her like a queen and when she learns that Hans has inherited a fortune she and Hercules plan a way to get all of Hans' money.  She marries Hans with the intention of slowly poisoning him over time until he dies.  But the \\"freaks\\" at the circus learn of Cleo and Hercules' plan and set into motion a plan of revenge of their very own.<br /><br />At the time of its initial release, many people found FREAKS horrifying because of the human oddities.  Some would argue that we are now too desensitized by all the graphic and horrifying things we've been exposed to over the past two generations to find the film as frightening as it once must have seen.  I would like to think it's more because we've become more sensitive and compassionate about all people (of course, a movie like FREAKS would never get made today).  Whatever the case, the unusual people in FREAKS aren't disturbing and shocking.

I really enjoyed all of the special features. They are filled with all kinds of information about the movie, the performers, and the history of cinema.r is the strong man Hercules (Henry Victor), who makes his living lousing upon wealthy women.  Though Cleo isn't rich, Hans treats her like a queen and when she learns that Hans has inherited a fortune she and Hercules plan a way to get all of Hans' money.  She marries Hans with the intention of slowly poisoning him over time until he dies.  But the \\"freaks\\" at the circus learn of Cleo and Hercules' plan and set into motion a plan of revenge of their very own.    At the time of its initial release, many people found FREAKS horrifying because of the human oddities.  Some would argue that we are now too desensitized by all the graphic and horrifying things we've been exposed to over the past two generations to find the film as frightening as it once must have seen.  I would like to think it's more because we've become more sensitive and compassionate about all people (of course, a movie like FREAKS would never get made today).  Whatever the case, the unusual people in FREAKS aren't disturbing and shocking.  With our modern lens, audiences can see beyond the \\"freaks\\" and see them as the people they really were (as they movie says, \\"They are all God's children) and see the movie for the excellent film it is.

B000002L9J|5.0|This is very possibly the best album ever.    But you must give it a chance. If you're used to the dreck played constantly on the radio, it make take you many plays before you find this album's appeal. But once you finally discover it, this album may become one of your dearest friends. Try to get to know it, it won't let you down.
1401219268|2.0|When I saw the trailer for the movie for the first time I did a little research and found that this is the best selling graphic novel of all time.  I was shocked when learned this and had a sinking feeling in my soul that I somehow needed to turn in my \\"geek membership card\\" because I never even heard of this graphic novel before.  I knew going in it was more of an anti-hero story so I wasn't fooled by false expectations.  But it became clear after the second book (this is a compilation of 12 comics) that this story is mostly pointless.  Empty and pointless... Not only is it pointless but it's painfully repetitive.  The metaphors just say the same thing over and over... People suck... I GET IT!  The \\"mystery\\" is flat and obvious and after the first book you couldn't care less, you just want it to end...  The grand \\"epic surprise ending\\" was so full of holes I almost laughed.  The first change to the ending I thought of to try and fix it was exactly how the movie changed it to fix it... that's how obviously wrong the book ending is.  I'm not sharing the ending of the movie or book because I don't believe in spoilers even for books that stink<br /><br />It's written well at times.  The art is fantastic especially compared to other comics of it's time.  It does have a surprise here and there and spurs an emotion or two... But I just don't see anything that justifies it's epic reputation.

B001P9KR8U|5.0|I saw this movie in the theater and thought its one of those movies you need to own. So when it came out, I bought it. The dvd case said it had:    Commentary  12 deleted scenes  Behind the scenes   Trailers  and more    I put in the dvd, watched the movie and went straight to the special features to only find movie trailers, and it doesnt have \\"Slumdog Millionaire\\"'s.    I still think it was a great movie to own, I dont care much about special features but if you arent going to have them, dont advertise them.    I bought it at Target so I didnt leave empty handed as they give you a copy of the movie script.
B001AKTZOQ|5.0|This was the first Creedence album that I ever bought many years ago. I still have the album because I can't sell it. It was worn out from constant play during my teenage party years. The album is a collection of Creedence classics and great covers of well know songs. The long play cover of Grapevine is one of their best covers. If you are a classic rock fan then you need to get a copy of this CD.

B000PKX2KA|3.0|Product worked after installation. Worked means it gets a fix within an acceptable time; after plotting (direct online connection) to Google Earth, it shows about 100' off. I cannot tell whether this is GE way to not plot within property lines or a problem with the device; since I don't have my Garmin 76CSx to compare the actual fix, I reserve the right to revisit this one.    Installation was a \\"pain\\"; the CD was full of wrong links and information and the web site was not much better. One can say \\"for the money it's OK\\" but that's the problem; with a little bit of attention to detail they could have offered a much better user experience. BTW, don't bother trying to contact the manufacturer/master distributor (hard to tell who does what in China).    In conclusion, just another gadget to \\"play\\" with provided you don't get easily frustrated. As an aside: the \\"Waterproof\\" part is telling ALL.    I would not buy another one and I would not recommended it to anyone who knows me.

It's a special thing for the two of us to do together, and let me tell you, waiting for her to watch another episode with me is torturous!  I look into Colin Morgan's eyes and all I can think is, MERLIN, I LOVE YOU.  Arthur and Gaius are amazing, too, though.  :]  I recommend it to anyone and everyone who likes a good fantasy storyline mixed with a bit of mystery and action!

1416914307|3.0|Warning, {major spoilers spoilers spoilers spoilers}.<br /><br />So I finished this long book today and felt compelled to give out some warnings to people interested in buying this final installment. To be honest, the overall story is okay at best and borders on being long winded. I would say that the book is worth buying, but only if you're that invested into the story. In all honesty, i feel like the story wasn't very good and i found City of Bones a slightly better read. It's a legit book, but full of major flaws.<br /><br />We start out with the cons.(spoiler)<br />-The incestuous part of the story is still pretty uncomfortable. I don't get how any logical person can accept this part of the story. At the end, you discover that Jace and Clary aren't really siblings, so they get together just for the happy ending. Logically, this is the weakest aspect.It's so obvious that Cassandra Clare just wanted to make a convenient happy ending. Pretty weak.<br /><br />-toooo much exposition.<br />major sigh. this is a huge flaw with books nowadays. authors work so hard to look intelligent, but it becomes a wasted effort. to be humorous, i won't say much here. I'll just say that there are sooo many explanations about fantasy elements and historical issues. i got bored real easy in some parts.<br /><br />-The setting is confusing.<br />For the first two books, we understand that the story is in New York. Clary Fray apparently never even left the state of New York until then. The city of Idris is confusing and all the portal traveling kind of made you lose place of everything. The group splits up at times and you're not sure where people are going. Perhaps one of the greatest strengths of the first book was the fact that the urban setting was so familiar. This so called city of glass is not so familiar.<br /><br />-We're not exactly sure where the story is going the whole time.<br />I suppose this is an inheritable flaw for all last installments, but there's this looming feeling we don't know where the story is going. We already know that Clary and Jace are going to fight Valentine so are the 500 pages just filler until then? It's hard to tell.<br /><br />Of course, there are going to be positive traits. There's a reason why this book is worth reading.<br /><br />+the characters are given justice this time around.(spoilers)<br />Maybe three times is the charm, but i really think the characters really flesh out this time. Maybe it's because i finally understand them, but i think the main and supporting characters are actually worth following. Magnus Bane and Alec hooking up is interesting, slightly strange but interesting(apparently Magnus is 700 yrs old). Little kid Max dies and forces Isabelle to show true emotion throughout the book. Jace and Clary show their inner thoughts a bit too much, but as a reader i want to understand the characters. With this trilogy, i had a chance to do it.<br /><br />+provides closure.<br />As strange as the entire plot and direction could be, i found the ending satisfying. It works. I can't say it's perfect, but some series just don't know how to end or try to tease the readers. I found the ending here decent enough to be acceptable for fans. At first, i thought the ending would be terrible but i was okay with it. I think if you're reading a series, the ending is important.<br /><br />A final point about the series. Jace and Clary's relationship was pretty illogical and it really marked a moment of no return. We discover that Jace is actually born from a dead woman and Valentine decides to raise him as his own. To be honest, the moment we discover Jace and Clary COULD BE related, there was no way to make the story perfect. Everyone knows it. I think another fantasy story in this vein will come around again.

B001DJLCRC|5.0|I love this show and could not wait for it to come out on DVD. The story line is certainly nothing that has ever been done before. Walt is endearing and the viewer can sympathize with what he is going through. His choices are perhaps not what the average person would choose, but they make for very interesting situations. The darker side of humanity, who hasn't thought of what they would do if they were diagnosed with a terminal illness? Definitely better viewed by mature audiences.
0316168815|5.0|The novel The Lovely Bones is written in 1st person point of view. The author was trying to convince the reader of something dramatizing, when Susie Salmon was raped and killed. The general genre of this novel is drama. The book fits in to this because it creates suspense while the family is looking for her murderer, yet Susie can see them from heaven. The book also creates sadness by letting you into the families pain of losing their daughter. The intended audience I think would be for young teens to adults, no one younger than 13 should read this novel because of its realistic situations and heartache. The authors style is informal because it is a young girl of 14 talking to the reader throughout the novel. The writing style of the novel is outstanding. It is very different from any other book I have ever read, and it really makes you appreciate what and who you have in life. It suites the intended audience very well. The book affected me by making me more aware of the world around me. It made me appreciate people more, it shows you not to take anyone for granted. I personally love this novel, it has been the best book I have read so far. I don't think that anything was changed, abandoned, or reinforced from my ideas. The novel isn't really related to my own life or personal agenda. The most it relates to me is that it is a young girl who loves her family. I haven't had any personal experiences in my life relate to this subject, and I hope that I never do. I would definitely recommend this book to others. It is very inspiring and heartfelt. I think all young girls should read it, it makes you aware of what you have around you in the world and how fast it can all be taken away.   The author Alice Sebold has tried to pull the reader in with a very dramatic novel. She grabs the readers attention by starting out with a world that is unfamiliar. The young girl, Susie Salmon, is trapped in heaven and is watching as her family unfolds the mystery of her murder. Alice Sebold has succeeded very well at making her point towards the reader. The novel is gripping due to the fact that how her family struggles to stick together through the very hard time of losing their first born child, Susie Salmon. Alice Sebold accomplishes getting her point to the reader by she wants the beginning to have a lot of suspense, and give you hope throughout the book. There is hope for Susie Salmon's family to figure out who murdered her, and during this time it destroys her family. While the family is going through very hard times they still never give up on their daughter. The ending ties everything together greatly. Reading this novel can change your entire outlook on life.
0312360266|3.0|I picked up this book for my kids after reviews compared it to Twilight. I'm glad I read this before my kids did, because there's no way I want them reading this. I couldn't believe that the F-word is used throughout, and one of the characters is introduced while trying to have oral sex with her boyfriend. My 11 and 14 year old loved Twilight, but there is absolutely no way they're reading this any time soon. In the book's defense, the story line is interesting, but I didn't think the writing was the greatest. And whoever classified this as 9th grade and up on Amazon ought to re-think that rating.
0060935464|5.0|There are so many reviews and websites about Harper Lee's To Kill a Mockingbird that it's difficult to imagine adding much to the discussion.  This was not required reading for me during my middle or high school years and I recently read it because it was chosen by my book club.  There are so many lessons to be gleaned from this book and I think there's something for everyone to take away.<br /><br />Told from the view of Jean Louise \\"Scout\\" Finch who does not fit the stereotype of a young lady, this story highlights and challenges the assumptions that are often made about those whom we don't understand or know much about, the racial inequalities and prejudices that exist in our society, and the importance of family, integrity, and morality.<br /><br />The story starts out a bit slow, but stay with it and you'll be glad you did.  It wasn't a page turner for me and took a bit of resolve to stick with it in the beginning, but it was well worth the time to read it to the end.  It was one of those books that had me going back to reread and ponder passages throughout.<br /><br />Excellent read with layers of meaningful insights.

B001KVZ6F2|5.0|If you are not moved by \\"Gran Torino\\", something must be wrong with you.  We share Walt's journey from curmudgeon to redemption with both laughs and sorrow.    I disagree with criticism of some of the actors being wooden.  Think about it, how many of us really converse as if we were living a glib, prelearned line, Hollywood dialogue.  We hesitate, gather our thoughts, and continue.    There are several call-backs from Eastwood's previous characters.  \\"Get off my lawn\\" is delivered like Harry Callahan's \\"Make my day\\".  He spits tobacco juice like Josey Wales.  He snarls like Will Munny. He delivers \\"F**k me\\" like Ben Shockley.  Walt is my favorite Eastwood character, as he is a compilation of Eastwood's best.    The Detroit urban blight is captured as \\"Gran Torino\\" was filmed on location in and around Detroit.  My hometown (Lansing, Michigan) is much the same as Detroit, this is a movie about people and places I know.    Open your heart, open your mind, and let \\"Gran Torino\\" wash over you.  You'll be glad yo did.
B001GM28HO|1.0|...but it upsets me that such music is hitting the airwaves. When I heard \\"Just Dance\\", it reminded me of all the underage girls from high school who would go out to the clubs and get wasted. \\"Gonna be okay\\". Yeah, right. Massive hangover the next day is more like it. Yes, I know music is about whatever lyrics you want to write about, but it bothers me that this is hitting the ears of the 13-17 year old girls. They probably don't give a care about the words, but I don't feel right hearing my 15 -year-old cousin belt the song out. I guess you can get into a whole arguement about the rappers and other \\"singers\\" about their lyrics, but the fact that she is overly-hyped in pop and media as opposed to others...it's upsetting.<br /><br />I listened to the album so not to be ignorant. Pretty much every song sounds the same; there's a kind of sound effect like a note of a saxophone or something that's present in almost every song (I'm guessing a \\"signature sound\\" for her music) and it's annoying as hell. Like others have said, the instrumentals are okay, but the lyrics are ridiculous.
B00008MZ0N|5.0|I have watched this movie several time and though it was great. Because I was not that knowledgeable about street racing I did not look for details to pick at. I just set back and enjoyed what I thought was a very good movie and I think Paul Walker did a great job as an undercover agent for  the FBI and local police to get to Dom (Vin Diesel) which I also thought he was very good. The street racing was exciting and very colorful.

1416562605|4.0|Adiga has created a stunning portrait of present-day India, some fictional characters in it and its land. If the facts are accurate, the picture is appauling in its poverty, corruption and stink. Adiga skillfully uses suspense and foreshadowing in saying the title character will kill his master without saying when, why or how. A bumpy, disturbing ride.
B001FB4W0W|5.0|I love this show! It's well written, deals with a lot of realistic issues (that is if vampires came out of the coffin and lived openly), It makes you think. I love the characters, Lafayette is my favorite.
B001CZVVUU|5.0|Opera lovers easily put off by \\"updated\\" stagings of traditional 19th-century operas might well be missing something very special here, for this 1950's revisioning of Massenet's glorious 'Manon' is a true showcase for the incredible talents of Anna Netrebko and Rolando Villazon. Netrebko in particular is simply dazzling, undergoing astonishing physical makeovers from act to act, and conveying the varying emotions of her character convincingly and with complete naturalness. You simply cannot take your eyes off of her. All this while singing with her usual luscious, creamy tone. Just gorgeous. Villazon is all intensity and passion, reaching his zenith in the Saint-Sulpice scene, where he and Netrebko all but tear the scenery apart. They have charisma to burn, and the chemistry between them is palpable. The rest of the cast is nowhere near their level, but they do a serviceable job in their supporting roles. Though this co-production between the LA Opera and the Staatsoper Unter den Linden in Berlin (where this performance was taped in the summer of 2007) sets the action a couple of centuries later than Massenet had intended, it nevertheless has some very clever and brilliant moments, but traditionalists will not be happy.  Any doubts about the production, however, fade into the background whenever Netrebko or Villazon is on stage.    The Blu-ray 1080i/60 PQ is stunning all around, and the AQ has great presence and dynamic range. (I listened to the 2-channel stereo PCM track.) Very highly recommended!
B001U0HBPQ|5.0|The career of David Fincher is to be highly commended, and it's about time he got an Oscar nom. My first notice of his career was \\"Alien³\\", not liked by many, but my 2nd fave in the Alien series. Certainly, Ridley Scott was inventive with the first Alien movie; James Cameron blew it all out of the water with \\"Aliens\\". Both directors were establishing their early efforts well. \\"Alien³\\" was Fincher's opportunity to create new stuff to the franchise; after \\"Aliens\\", that was a tuff act to follow. Still, he created a world that was new, different and gave Sigourney great chances to kick alien butt. I liked it even better than the first. I was made aware of Fincher; darkness, intrigue and a new style of film-making. Then I saw \\"Seven\\", and many others by Mr. Fincher, and, finally, \\"Zodiac\\", which I thought brought his purity of thought to fruition.  Well, I watched \\"Benj Button\\", and I knew it was a long film, but with the background of the admiration I've grown to expect from Mr. Fincher, I was open for any amount of craziness done with class. Fincher succeeds. A bizarre story, indeed, dark overtones abide in a relatively simple and sweet story. Love is everywhere, and a driving force throughout. Love, as seen through the eyes of every person involved, is not taken lightly; mortality is second. Love of a child, a mother, a lover, a comrade, a teacher...ALL well-examined. I repeat, I was never bored for a minute. I'm an older male, and could relate to the material. It's a very bizarre story, but in the hands of David Fincher, and his brilliant screenwriters Eric Roth and Robin Swicord, it all makes perfect sense. The flawless editing of Kirk Baxter and Angus Wall puts everything in a perspective to keep it all coherent. Then there's the performances, not a weak link in the bunch. Brad Pitt has been criticized for not being \\"present\\", but he handles the complications very well. I really loved Cate Blachett; all the rest, Taraji Henson, Tilda Swinton, Julia Ormond among others, all perfection. This is a film that will live on as a lesson to film-makers. Taking an impossible story and making it plausible...well, I'm impressed and have no end of admiration for this film.  UPDATE: I have the 2-disc Criterion DVD, and it's fine. Some of the extras explain too much of the FX, which might destroy the magic for some. I really love this film.others, all perfection. This is a film that will live on as a lesson to film-makers.

B001DEVZUG|5.0|Annie Lennox's \\"best of....\\" collection is a great overview of her terrific solo career. Her voice is a one-of-a-kind and so powerful that you never forget that she is one of the greats of her genreration. There are so many songs here that will send chill bumps of the spine that it is hard to single out just one. The best thing to say is that even if you aren't a huge fan, this CD will please even the casual admirer of Ms Lennox's talent.

B001RTP3YQ|5.0|The sound quality is very good, and Mr. Cohen did make sure he used the excellent Leanne Unger as mixer. My only regret is that those folks picked London as the show to record for the obligatory double CD. I think something grandiose like the O2 Arena might be an interesting venue for the DVD. But I remain convinced the CD would have even been better quality (sound, performance, intimacy, nuances, flamenco-guitar solos, etc.) had they picked a smaller theatre such as Paris' Olympia for instance. But Mr. Cohen and the suits over at Columbia are understandably in a rush to take advantage of the 2008-2009 tour's extraordinary momentum, and make money off of it. I don't blame them; it's tough out there, especially in light of Leonard's recent financial fiasco with his \\"friend\\" & \\"manager\\" Kelley Lynch. If I were an executive at Sony Music, I would release half a dozen double-CD package from the tour, like Pearl Jam and Tori Amos did not too long ago. Only means of capturing a tiny bit of the magic of such a remarkable tour.
B00192KCQ0|4.0|Some claim to be old school fans, and that this album is a return to form so to speak. They are alomost right, The lyrics are still problematic, Too many wo-wooowa's and yeah-yeaaaha's in the mix, been there since the black album, Hetfield needs to put everything they made before the black album and listen, his singing was far greater back then, before he self relised people liked his singing and started this crap. Although i admit these are missing on some songs, but still certain ones way too much of it.      Musicly this album is far better than St. Anger, and has more of that Metallica sound that has been missing since justice for all.    My suggestion is shy away from the radio songs and see what this album is about.
B001K3JF7K|5.0|I have never been a fan of Diana's music, but this record has totally won me over.  I really love it--I know I will listen to it again and again.  The whole record was a pleasure, but my favorite track has to be \\"You're My Thrill\\"--fantastic.      I can't understand why anyone would give this album anything but 5 stars.  It seems like a lot of reviewers are upset that Diana isn't singing exactly the same way she did 10 years ago.  That seems a little harsh.  Is she really supposed to just keep repeating herself over and over again?  Her life has changed, so it seems only right that her music should evolve as well.     For me, her singing is much sexier and warmer than it used to be.  I loved the \\"breathiness\\" that has everyone so freaked out.  I felt it gave the record a very confidential, intimate tone--like whispered secrets.   I also sensed a lot more confidence from her--she really owned those songs, while still paying proper respect to their origins.      And by the way, no fair reviewing this record based on the free audio clips.  Anyone writing a review ought to really listen to the entire record first.  Another small point several other reviewers seem to have missed:  Este Seu Olhar is sung in Portuguese--not Spanish.
1439102813|5.0|It's almost impossible to believe that Still Alice is Lisa Genova's first novel, so deft, mature and spellbinding is her tale.    The heartbreaking story of a vital, brilliant university professor diagnosed with early on-set Alzheimer's disease is frightening, compelling, agonising and quite, quite beautiful.    Genova who holds a Ph. D. in neuroscience from Harvard, has cleverly resisted the temptation to impress the reader with her doubtless intimate scientific knowledge of this incurable disease, choosing instead to chronicle Alice's descent into mental confusion and bewilderment simply, and in the most compassionate of terms.    As dementia claims Alice's brain, the family, friends and colleagues who love her must deal with their own confusion and fear as they try to come to terms with the erosion of a mind on which they had come to depend.    During the course of the story I learned much about Alzheimer's, and though it was one of the most difficult, painful reads I've had in some time, I couldn't put the book down.    Still Alice is a story about the loss of hope and the irreversible shattering of a family's dreams. But it's also a wry portrayal of a woman whose mark on the world cannot easily be erased.
B001EYGOEM|5.0|This is my first Taylor Swift CD and she has definitely earned a new fan. Though I listen to a wide range of music, I don't typically buy country music. However, I loved Love Story so much that I thought I would give the whole CD a try, and I'm glad I did. I'm usually inclined to buy soundtracks and mixed artist CDs, as I find that I only like a handful of songs on an artist's album. However, I've listened to this CD over and over and never skip a track. I really enjoy every song.
B001TODO54|5.0|Here is a book with a hero worthy of Alana. I look forward to more stories in this series, with such a promising beginning.
B001ED7C58|5.0|I am a Twilight fan. I LOVED the books, thought the movie was OK. But, I actually really, really like the soundtrack. I had read that some people thought it wasn't edgy enough, others thought it was too edgy - I thought it had a great balance. I've listened to it numerous times and like it more and more each time. I won't comment on every song, but I will echo others' sentiments that Bella's Lullabye just didn't fit the bill. Also, I thought Rob Pattinson's song had real potential, but it drove me insane that I couldn't understand a word of what he was singing! He has a nice voice but, please, enunciate!
B000784WMW|1.0|Oh my gosh!  There is no emotion.  I just can't believe Timothy Dalton's stiff unemotional version of a wonderful classic.  Brits can be very reserved in public, but in private they can be truly loving and...emotional.  This version is cold!  I wasted by money.
B001R4MEYS|4.0|this is the best Mastodon album so far.  The differences  between this and previous albums is immediately noticeable.  first, the production is way better - no more muffled music where it sounded like the guitars were competing for sonic space from other sounds. everything is distinct which is good given that there are many layers to the music.<br /><br />the other big thing - singing.  some folks don't like this. they want 24/7 snarl. but on this music, singing mixed with growl is good. the first song on each of the last albums was an immediate cookie-crusher, where this album eases into things a little bit more slowly. but the end-product is good. damn good. the heaviest song is the title track - if you don't want your cookies crushed, hide them when you play this song.  scott kelly from Neurosis is guest vocals (again) and it is awesome.<br /><br />the DVD extra really is worth the extra cash. most DVDs packaged with music totally suck. the interviews on this one are really cool and give some real insight into the making of the album and the direction of the album.<br /><br />so stop reading, get the album.<br /><br />Update, May 2, 2009. after listening almost non-stop to this album, i've got to up the rating to 5 stars. this is the album to beat this year!
B001K3JF7K|1.0|Holy smoke...this cd is really awful..sounds like she is having a hard time getting the words out and is out of breath.  Was looking forward to the cd but now after just hearing the samples forget it...no wonder it is only $9.99 and will ship for free...
1582701709|1.0|If anyone--and I do mean ANYONE--over the age of 12 and not under the influence of drugs finds this book even the least bit enlightening or entertaining...than you have a serious problem on your hands.<br /><br />And seeing as how the majority of ratings for this book are 5-star, and it's sales were anything but lackluster here in America, than I'd say that's a shining example of why the rest of the world deems us idiots.<br /><br />There is some common sense in this book, that if you didn't already know, proves you simply lack common sense. And then there are absurdities in this book that prove people will believe any rediculous web that's spun for them.<br /><br />What it comes down to is this: self-help books don't exist! How can someone else write a book to help you, and then call it self-help? That's bsurd. It's an author serving as a misinformed psychologist to the masses--nothing more.
B000OONQ30|5.0|There will always be naysayers when it comes to this kind of project--the commercialization of classical or operatic music has its downside, I'm sure.  But the Three Tenors concerts really did help win the hearts of many who were previously unfamiliar with the genre.  It's hard to argue that that's not a good thing.     However, I understand why purists are--at the very least--ambivalent about projects like this. It's at least as much show-biz as art. But then again, one of the first things they teach you about Opera in music appreciation class is that it was originally a popular art form, and if three of the greatest tenors of the latter 20th century could help re-popularize the genre once more, well, it's all to the good, right?     OK, there is the worry of over-commercialization.. The Three Tenors did become something of a brand name while they lasted--and mygosh all those spin-offs: 3 Irish Tenors, 2 Mo' Tenors, 3 Terrors (yes, they existed!), to say nothing of the soprano ensembles. All talented, I'm sure, but it gets to be a bit much.  You're almost tempted to say they created a monster.     But there were just so many good moments, especially when it was all fresh and new as it was for the first concert. Of course, Pavarotti's \\"Nessun Dorma\\" has justifiably become a popular classic, but Domingo's \\"No Puede Ser\\" and Carreras' \\"Granada\\" are almost as memorable. And when the three join forces on a reprise of \\"Nessun Dorma,\\" well, you forget any concerns you may have about crass commercialism and just enjoy these three beautiful voices blending beautifully.     Carreras' begins the program with \\"Lamento di Federico,\\" and he's just shaky enough that you wonder if his return to performing after having beaten leukemia wasn't perhaps a bit premature. But he gets progressively stronger and more assured as the evening wears on. You come to share in his sense of triumph.     I remember at the time that this concert was first broadcast on PBS, a co-worker of mine--an otherwise tough-talking dame in her 60s--declared herself to be a \\"Domingo gal.\\" And you can see why. His easy going masculinity and dashing looks clearly make him the hearthrob of the program. His voice has always struck me as being deeper and richer than most tenors, and I'm not surprised that he is taking on baritone roles in his later career. Of the \\"Three Tenors,\\" he's really the only one who could likely pull off such a move.     His much vaunted ambition and adventureness is evident even in this limited a program. He tackles pieces in German, French and English with a bit more ease than Carreras (while Pavarotti only seldom ventures from standard Italian repertoire).     In some ways though, the two Spaniards seem almost deferential to Pavarotti, the sole Italian and therefore (at least by some definitions) more of the heir to the operatic tradition. He was, in some ways, the most imperious, while being somewhat indifferent, it seemed, to his personal appearance. It may seem petty to wonder why he didn't bother to trim his beard, but it did appear almost defiantly unkempt. Nothing ragged about his vocals here, however. It's hard to imagine a more gorgeous instrument.     Newcomers to the world of opera could watch this broadcast in 1991 and experience firsthand how distinctive these singers were, what each could bring to a given piece--be it an operatic aria or a Neapolitan (or Spanish) song. They could also experience the emotion and the HUMOR that was characteristic of great singers' concerts. All in all, a good intro to the genre. And a brilliant commercial move--not that there's anything wrong with that.
B001NFNFNU|5.0|The ordered item arrived very shortly after having been ordered, which is typical of amazon!! Haven't watched the movie yet but whether or not it's any good doesn't have anything to do with amazon.  Thanks
B00005JLEU|4.0|I am not big on many of the Animation movies with their spin on  what I consider overacting heroes, however from time to time I find those films that rise above any cultural difference and truly inspire and illuminate something special (e.g. Akira, Ghost in the Shell, and Princess Moanoke). This movie along with being nicely animated had an interesting way of telling the story. A family goes on a picnic and enters a strange world through a path into a walking tunnel. The lessons the young girl learns reminded me of another great story (Wizard of Oz). I don't mean it reminded me of it because they are alike, but because they have great and unusual settings and characters showing you very different perspectives. I think most the family will find this animated story entertaining and educational. Great quality DVD with plenty of replayability. If you enjoyed this catch [[ASIN:B00005JM2O Kiki's Delivery Service]].<br /><br />CA Luster
B001O54NHQ|5.0|I listened to this a while back! I was a huge fan of the 1989 version of batman with jack nicholson and Kim Bassinger, and I thought it was one of the best batman's they ever put out. I really loved the funky music they put in the movie when I was a kid, and I assumed it was Michael Jackson or a compliation of other 80's artists. The beats have the best 80's beats of any of the songs that came out during that time.I was excited years and years later to discover that Prince was the sole artist on this album. I was like,wow! I like him already,and now I like him even more.His Music is just great. The thing that made this album cool for me,was that it was catchy. My favorite tracks Batdance, Vicki's Waiting, Partyman. If any body loves good music then this is def. a must have in your music collection!
B0015AARJI|4.0|Bought and loved.  I have two of these so that one is always charged.  Even better, this version has rumble.  Buy WITHOUT hesitation!    However, I also recommend the PS3 blu-ray remote.  Works amazing... it even works without line-of-sight!
B000PKX2KA|5.0|My previous laptop's GPS receiver did not work with my new Vista laptop, and I had some trouble finding adequate documentation on some receivers concerning compatibility with Vista.  Happy to report that this unit works perfectly with the Vista driver downloaded from the manufacturer's site. Plus, it gets better reception than my old one -- it works inside the house where the old one did not.
0307346617|5.0|you know that feeling you get when you leave the movie theatre after a really great movie, the chills and tunnel vision that are the after-effects of total immersion? this book gave me that same feeling. simply amazing. i cannot recommenmd this book enough, and have lent it to two friends so far. max brooks is a genius.
B001NERPHS|4.0|I'm glad Columbia's bringing some more of the catalog up to the level of the reissues from a couple years back... but it's hard not to see these releases as missed opportunities, too -- especially this one.  Entire books have been written (Greil Marcus' The Old, Weird America aka Invisible Republic and Sid Griffin's recent Million Dollar Bash) about these sessions.  One of the finest bootleg collections of all time, the 4-disc A Tree With Roots (which upgraded the Genuine Basement Tapes releases), presented the complete, or nearly, picture of these sessions, which took place over months and encompassed improvised numbers (\\"See You Later, Allen Ginsberg\\"), still-unreleased Dylan nuggets (\\"Silent Weekend\\"), great covers of folk and country songs (too many to pick just one), in an open-ended spirit of good humor, friendship, trust, and endless possibilities.      If this is the only way you know how to access any of Bob's \\"Basement Tapes\\" material, or if you're curious and want a taste of it, or you're a completist or want to upgrade from the 1st-gen cd, or have a nostalgic fondness for this particular collection, then get this.  I'm sure the remastering will make these amateur recordings sound as good as they possibly can (and I hope future reviewers will let us know about the sound quality), but with this music that's somehow not the point.  The complete Basement Tapes need to be officially released, warts and all -- the legacy of American music demands it.  In the meantime, if you can find a way to access the full collection, track it down and revel in it.
0061122416|5.0|Centuries upon centuries ago, mankind survived on instinct, intuition, and fate to rule their lives.  Some say cultures as recent as some American Indians and Australian Aborigines possess similar connections to such spiritual understandings.  In Paulo Coelho's \\"The Alchemist\\", many of these universal truths are reintroduced to the modern world and the obtuse contemporary mind.<br /><br />A young shepherd, Santiago, receives a visionary dream an omen of sorts, and decides to act upon it.  All his life he's followed his heart, sometimes in opposition of his mind, and it has served him fairly well, teaching him lessons about the surrounding life and work that can't be cultivated from classroom lessons.  When his path leads him to a dream interpreter, a king, and eventually an alchemist - from all of whom he receives sage guidance and wisdom - he learns that achievement of his life's moral and spiritual obligation, his \\"Personal Legend\\", will be an incredibly rewarding albeit dangerous journey to the pyramids of Egypt.<br /><br />At its core, \\"The Alchemist\\" is about following one's dreams while embracing the worldly present, and having the wisdom to know that the painful lessons of the journey often dwarf the conclusion's impact.  Embracing all the beauties and miracles of the world, and following your heart, is better than constantly questioning if an omen is coincidence or whether the expectations of a dream will outweigh the dream's fulfillment.  Tapping into what Coelho refers to as \\"Universal Language\\" and \\"The Soul of the World\\" - principles akin to Buddhist fundamental beliefs about the connections between all life - allows true happiness and existence.  And to some extent we all still hold on to the threads of these precepts; otherwise, why do you talk to your car?  Written with simple yet enjoyable prose, this allegorical tale is completely absorbing.  Similar in complexity and profoundness to Lowry's [[ASIN:0440237688 The Giver]], I cannot recommend this book highly enough.
0312383320|5.0|At a time when the news and the economy are SO DEPRESSING - a light-hearted comedy was exactly what I needed!  Several times I laughed so hard I cried.

B001P9KR94|3.0|The Film:<br /><br />\\"Slumdog Millionaire\\" presents the Horatio Alger story of Jamal, a young, poor kid in the Bombay/Mumbai slums who endures various trials and tribulations to win a TV quiz show, get the girl, and escape his troubled life.<br /><br />The movie is slick and entertaining in the best Hollywood tradition. It puts the protagonists in various dangers, and has them escape in the nick of time, usually with some comeuppance being delivered to the antagonists. \\"Slumdog\\" offers a gritty portrayal of slum life in Mumbai, to the point where I was left wondering how accurate it really was. The relationship between the two brothers (Jamal and Salim) is relatively interesting. The central love story, between Jamal and Latika, strains credulity just a bit.<br /><br />The casting director did a very good job of matching child actors to their older counterparts, and it lends a nice continuity to the story.<br /><br />Overall, the ending is a bit too pat, much like many Hollywood stories. I also found the central conceit, that Jamal succeeds because \\"it is written\\" to be troublesome. Isn't this sort of reliance on destiny, social status conferred by birth, and prophecy, the kind of stuff that has held large portions of Indian society back by making them second-class citizens? I am by no means scholar of India's history or society - but I found this notion to be troubling.<br /><br />It's an entertaining movie, but in my opinion it never rises above its material. You can find the same type of story, conflict, and resolution in just about any Hollywood film. A young \\"nice guy\\" protagonist makes his way through a tough world, is rewarded by the universe for how swell he is, and gets a happy ending. This one just has \\"foreign\\" trappings. I found it to be a sort of poor man's \\"City of God,\\" a much better film by Fernando Meirelles.<br /><br />The Blu-Ray:<br /><br />The image in this transfer is relatively detailed, but it suffers from a wildly fluctuating black level throughout. Some scenes have good contrast, while others (usually in dark locales) exist in a grayed-out fog. I get the impression that this movie was filmed on digital, which doesn't handle low light scenes as well as celluloid. Whatever the reason, it just doesn't look very good during these scenes, which I would say comprise about 30% of the film. In its defense, the Blu-Ray offers a very vibrant and colorful image when it is not subject to the hazy mosquito noise of the darker scenes. At its best, this disc looks very good. It's just not always at its best.<br /><br />The DTS audio mix is also seriously problematic. This film switches between very quiet dialogue scenes and EXTREMELY loud action so quickly, (such as trains, gunshots, car crashes, etc.) it threatens to blow out your speakers. Making things more irksome is the heavily accented English - you need to have the dialogue scenes cranked up to really make them out. Essentially, it is impossible to watch this film without subtitles at a lower volume, because of the drastic changes in volume. This plagues the movie throughout. The center channel dialogue never, ever, ever manages to win in any contest with the front and rear channels. I wish they would have just done the film in Hindi with English subtitles. Then I could turn it down and just read the dialogue. Instead, I am forced to fiddle with the volume control for 2 straight hours, trying to anticipate when the next sudden rushing train noise might occur.<br /><br />Which is not to say that the loud stuff is bad. The sound, especially the music, is very rich and has a lot of surround effects. This is nice. But its dynamic range is just too much for the quiet and tender dialogue scenes. They should have leveled it out better.<br /><br />Extras include some making-of material, two commentaries, a music video, and deleted scenes. It's all very nice, except for that fact that they are presented in 480p. Yawn.<br /><br />************<br /><br />If you've seenit already and you are a fan, the Blu-Ray is a worthy purchase. Its image certainly does things that DVD cannot do in terms of detail. If you have not yet seen it, I would recommend renting first. The image is not very impressive, the sound mix is annoying, and the film itself is pretty average.that DVD cannot do in terms of detail. If you have not yet seen it, I would recommend renting first.

B001MYIXAC|5.0|I understand the uproar of the poor translatin of this film, watching Hero with Jet Li comes to mind, but I think rating it 1 star for that reason alone is wrong. The movie stood as an excellent film, dare I see a coming of age piece, and the translation was secondary to the film.     POSSIBLE SPOILER!    That being said, I loved that the movie wasn't soley based on vampirism, but instead was about a young boy learning about love(?) and life. Finding strength in someone else to develop and grow into a stronger person, was what stuck out in my mind. Also, even though there was blood and brutality, the movie had a soft edge to it. I believe the edge came from the scenery (constant snow, and drab apartments), or from the superb acting of the child stars.    I recomend this movie to anyone who can stomach a bit of blood in order to see a wonderful film!
0380730405|5.0|I love this book.  It's a classic for a reason. So well written, great plot. Hitchcock made a movie out of this and DuMaurier's short story, The Birds.
044024367X|1.0|I'm a 20-year naval veteran, and a Buddhist, who's enjoyed ALL of the Reacher books -- until this one, which I finished just moments ago. \\"Nothing to Lose\\" was overlong, bloated with unnecessary detail -- and unbelievably, unexpectedly tedious in its plot development. That, combined with the large type and line-spacing, means this book should've been a third of its sale-size. And, excuse me -- in a world where there are REAL religious terrorists blowing themselves and everyone around them up, every day of the week, Mr. Child couldn't think of a more menacing or believable enemy than America's Christian \\"religious right\\"? Hollywood has been on this kick for several years; it's a flavor that seeps into much of their network programming, and I'm sick of the stale, overworked taste of it. Even the most extremist Christian fringe errs on the side of insularity, and historically is much more inclined to snuff its own membership than anyone around them. Where next, Mr. Child -- evil CEOs daring to make a profit? A little originality, please!
0739367676|5.0|Yes, it had some cheezy-ness to it.  Renesmee is a HORRIBLE name.  There was some backstory to wade through.  It sorta did tie up all the loose ends in a nice bow, but through it all, our friends--Edward, Bella, Alice, Jacob--were all with us.  I've fallen in love with each of these characters, and I'm so reluctant to let them go!  Even if they have become less archetypcal and more like our neighbors, I still love them, and it was great to have more time with them.    As for the audiobook specifically, I really love this format.  It's great for driving (makes commuting a blast), and when I get involved in a series that's read by someone who really fits the part, it allows me to run around the house doing all the un-fun stuff but still listening to my story.  When I am alone at the office, I can listen to them there, too.  My husband has even gotten hooked!
B000AMJG4Y|3.0|The DVD was in great shape it just took really long to receive it.  I understand that I received it within the dates specified.  I have purchased quite a few items from Amazon.com and this has got to be the one that took the longest to receive.  You can say that I was a bit disappointed.  But like I said the DVD was in great shape.
0061245097|4.0|I did enjoy this book and I am glad I read it. It was not as good as the first one, but still a very fun read. Light on intellect, and heavy on action, with some romance thrown in for good flavor. The story line seemed to lull.

B001NHZ2KW|5.0|The finest biographical rock documentary, it is negligent to not include this with 'The T.A.M.I. Show', 'Monterey Pop', 'Woodstock', 'Gimme Shelter' and the other documentaries that have achieved legendary status. But I think there is one more thing that needs to come onto DVD to really understand what The Who meant to their fans.    Much more so than other acts, writers discussing The Who will insist that their opinions are not influenced by radio airplay - as a result they will claim that everything recorded before 'Tommy' was perfect while everything after was garbage (this film even has something to offer that crowd as there are four (!) versions of \\"My Generation\\").    Growing up as a fan, however, my friends and I would decide what to buy and listen to according to our own instincts about what was exciting and energetic rather than the delusions of the writers at Rolling Stone. This meant of course that among one of rock's mightiest repertoires one album would always be the greatest ('Who's Next') and one song would always be the greatest - \\"Won't Get Fooled Again\\". The original version forms a performance so stirring and majestic that it cannot be left off any SINCERE list of the greatest rock songs of all time.    But as the song's reputation grew throughout the 1970's the live performance of WGFA transformed into something far,far beyond a routine rendition. The grandest of grande finales, it became the single greatest moment of anticipation, drama and ecstasy in all of 20th Century music - I personally can't think of anything comparable other than the endings of the greatest Verdi operas. If you were lucky enough to be with 20,000, 40,000 or 60,000 people when every last one of them raised their hands and yelled YEEEEEEAAAHHHHHH!!!! with Roger at the end of the last synthesizer break, then you knew you had gone through a spine-tingling, goose-bumping audience thrill you could experience nowhere else.    All Who fans should be grateful to Jeff Stein for acknowledging the pride of place of WGFA in the Who canon by selecting it as the concluding number. The version here is magnificent, unto itself justifying a five star rating. But because it was filmed on a soundstage, there is only the faintest glimmer of the audience dynamics that would help the viewer understand what that song, and indeed what the band, meant to its audience. I'm still hoping that someday there will be a DVD of comparable quality of one of the large scale shows (the Shea Stadium concert comes to mind) so everyone can understand completely why The Who inspired more devotion than any act in rock music history.
B001KVZ6ES|5.0|A brooding Eastwood just wants to be left alone. He is truly living in the past and quite content with it. His compassion for an ethnic minority neighbor overcomes his self imposed isolation and his Dirty Harry character emerges. My favorite line is when he is confronted by the gangbangers and slowly explains to them that there are some people that they should just not #%*@ with! A must for any Eastwood collection!
B000UJ48UO|5.0|This is a movie that I've viewed repeatedly over the years and still enjoy very much as it is strikingly genuine versus most Hollywood presentations of War.  Having been drafted myself in 1969 and took an extra year to determine my vocational choice versus being dictated.  Military was very different as there was no volunteer system yet - you found yourself serving next to teachers and engineers and other professionals because of the draft.  The presentation of Boot Camp is so real in this movie and the Dufus that commits murder/suicide - there is one of these guys in every company that gets pushed and pushed and during war where you're losing hundreds weekly it's the DI's job to get them through not send them home.    I often found Platoon and Apocalypse nice to look at but found them insulting to GI's and unreal. The portrayal of Boot Camp and it's push to remove individualism at all costs for the TEAM was very real and the discipline enforced by the group in it's partnering in said discipline with blanket parties is genuine.  Somebody screws up invariably and the group pays a price and the group then  becomes the enforcer of TEAM.      The presentation of Vietnam experience matches pretty much exactly what everyone shared and also quite often a number of troops were killed due to simple mistakes - Charlie was a master of guerilla warfare and the war was a roaming battle zone that often had no boundaries. Vietnam had plenty of cheap sex, booze, smoke but younger people may never understand how great the casualty count was on both sides - we lost over 53,000 but the Vietnamese lost over a million.  War is Hell and no real glory.  This movie depicts it far better than any I've seen.      Part ONE the making of a Marine and Part TWO the reality of being (slogans don't mean jack when your in an ambush) - there's no a video game do over.  While most of us that survived are now old farts, this movie brings home one's youth of the day and how overnight you can become theproperty of the US Govt and Holy Crap why am I in this friggin foreign land fighting for this hunk of dirt, swamp - we used to talk of what the hell would we win even if we could claim victory? A place to sell more coke and consumer goods?     Now, today I find myself buying goods like Canon Printers and a Jacket from a luxury store and candles from Target and they have imprinted Made in Vietnam on them.  So we won without having to fight - money talks better than bullets!      For a reminder of what it's about especially when a draft is in place during national emergencies view this flick - God Bless our Troops in Iraq and may they leave that dust bowl (with OIL below) sooner than later and today I would ask the same damn question - If we could declare a Victory what the hell have we one? Nothing!!! The futility of War and the pawns of the soldiers that serve us and die for Jack too far often!  I despise the waste of any Soldier! (Human Being) Enjoy the Movie for the reality it depicts despite the passing of time!
B001PPF126|4.0|A correction to start: The Amazon listing shows 18 tracks on Disc 2 when, in fact, there are 21 tracks. Amazon forgot to list these three from the \\"Fake Plastic Trees\\" single. These three songs are found at tracks 11,12 and 13 on Disc 2 of the \\"Bends\\" reissue:    Fake Plastic Trees (Live Acoustic)   Bulletproof....I Wish I Was (Live Acoustic)  Street Spirit (Live Acoustic)    \\"The Bends\\" was the disc that caused anyone paying attention in 1995 to realize that Radiohead was going to be a contender. Their mostly-by-the-numbers-alt-rock-format debut disc from 1993 called \\"Pablo Honey\\" was, well...somewhat promising, but not really earth-shattering. They had hit the charts fairly big with the late-breaking \\"Creep\\" single (which flopped in the UK the first time around), but the title of this one is a clear reference to the discomfort they were feeling from the increasing numbers of so-called fans coming to their shows--many just for that one \\"I'm a Weirdo\\" song. The condition known as the bends is a painful onset of wide-ranging physical problems facing those who transition too quickly from high to low pressure, usually associated with surfacing fast after diving in the depths of a body of water---i.e. Radiohead was experiencing the pain of \\"rising\\" quickly. In fact, the single that preceded the album release, \\"My Iron Lung\\", is directly about this very issue of \\"Creep\\" becoming a both a \\"life-support\\" as well as a giant millstone around the band's collective neck.     Not much on \\"Pablo Honey\\" prepared the listener for the excellence of their second outing, a time at which many bands have been known to display the notorious \\"sophomore slump\\". Instead, Radiohead demonstrated exponential development from that debut disc to this one. \\"The Bends\\" relied much less on the \\"needles in the red\\" three guitar assault that was trotted out time and again on \\"Pablo Honey\\". The \\"Bends\\" opener, \\"Planet Telex\\", with its fast-tremolo guitar sounds, repeated/delayed keyboard signals, anddistorted off-kilter beat and vocals, sends the strong message right off the bat that this band is not afraid to experiment and test the boundaries (something they would do in abundance by the end of the decade with \\"Kid A\\"). Nearly half of the disc never rises above a mellow, acoustic vibe--much of this quieter territory is explored this time out compared to the very short stretch of \\"Pablo Honey\\" that visited a more mellow zone. A share of the harder songs still had the soft versus /loud choruses dynamics of the textbook early 90's alternative rock song going (\\"Bones\\", \\"Just\\", \\"My Iron Lung\\", \\"Black Star\\"), but it is clear from the overall collection of 12 songs on Disc 1 that Radiohead are pulling away from the expectations of their little niche in the Rock world. Seen in hindsight, this disc is a natural mid-point between the raw guitar-driven debut of \\"Pablo Honey\\" and the more experimental and distinctive \\"OK Computer\\" that would follow this disc by two years.        This period was extremely prolific for Radiohead; they had a hard time selecting the 12 songs to go on the album and were left with essentially more than an entire CD worth of unreleased recordings, usually of very high quality, for their B-sides. Disc 2 contains four BBC session recordings that are rarities as well as all of the \\"regular\\" mixes of the 14  studio B-sides released on the \\"Bends\\"-era singles (and the three live acoustic songs I mentioned at the beginning). This lengthy second disc is far from comprehensive, however; many of the songs released during the year and a half or so around the album release are not to be found here. By my count, there are another 14 songs released mostly as B-sides or promos in this period (they are all alternate mixes/re-mixes of \\"Bends\\" era songs or live tracks) that did not make it to the reissue. This release could easily have added a third CD (instead of the DVD as the third disc on the \\"deluxe\\" version) to round up all of these missing items. Here'sa list of what did not make it on the reissue bonus disc:    Planet Telex (hexadecimal mix) High and Dry single (CD2)  Planet Telex (l.f.o. jd mix) High and Dry single (CD1)  Planet Telex (Karma Sunra mix) Just single (CD1)  Killer Cars (Mogadon version) Just single (CD1)  Talk Show Host (Romeo + Juliet Soundtrack Remix Version)  Bones (Live At The Forum) Just single (CD2)  Planet Telex (Live At The Forum) Just single (CD2)  Just (Live At The Forum) US High and Dry single   Anyone Can Play Guitar (Live At The Forum) Just single (CD2)  (Plus all five songs on the Dutch \\"Pinkpop Edition\\"/Belgian \\"Live\\" promo EP):  Fake Plastic Trees (Live)  Blow Out (Live)  Bones (Live)  You (Live)  High And Dry (Live)    The other two 2009 2-disc reissues, \\"Pablo Honey\\" and \\"OK Computer\\", are much more comprehensive than this one in terms of containing virtually all released material from the same timeframe as the main album. This one certainly included the cream of the crop, but it fell short of serving the very customer base a release like this is aimed at--rabid Radiohead fans that want everything. It's a shame that this misses the remixes of the album's lead-off and most experimental tune, as these demonstrate the dawning signs of the band's open-mindedness regarding dance/electronic/hip hop music. They were surely the only guitar-oriented band commissioning such radical remixes in 1995, and they were telegraphing an affinity and willingness to color outside the lines that would certainly crop up later on their regular releases like \\"Kid A/Amnesiac\\".     You will have to do some further digging to get the full picture of the \\"Bends\\" era Radiohead, but this collection is the equivalent of a portrait that cuts off the top of one's head. Most of the important features are there, but there's something integral to the overall image that is missing.
0783211856|4.0|This is the first time I purchsed something from Amazon, and I am very satisfied.  The product was in gret condition and the price was also great.
0307269752|3.0|The story itself is quite good, in fact it was a breakaway bestseller, but the author's own story is equally compelling.  He was active in the Swedish Communist Worker's Party and he intended to leave all of his assets to that organization.  But his will was not witnessed, and therefore not legally enforceable, and at his death of a massive heart attack at 50, his assets, including this book's royalties, went to his father and brother, under Swedish probate law.  The original title of the book showed his political leanings, \\"Men Who Hate Women.\\"  Someone had the foresight to re-title it \\"The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo\\" when it was translated into English.  I doubt it would have become a bestseller with the original title. He also made no attempt to publish the book, writing it for his own enjoyment.  As a committed communist, the acquisition of wealth was unimportant to him.  His father published it posthumously.<br /><br />This book has two distinct plots.  There is the story of an investigative journalist who is targeted by the horrible rich capitalists.  Of course it turns out that his enemy is not only a capitalist, since readers might not see that as sufficiently venal; he is a drug dealer, a weapons dealer, and runs prostitutes.  The second story, completely unrelated to the first, is the investigation of a missing person/possible homicide that turns into the discovery of a serial murderer.  If there is a connection, it is that the murderer turns out to be...you guessed it...another horrible rich capitalist.<br /><br />As the story unfolds it turns out that the husband of the married woman the journalist is sleeping with is just fine with the arrangement.  And the journalist's sociopathic partner, a gifted hacker with a dragon tattoo, is truly a fine person, despite her emotional disability.  That disability, Asperger's Syndrome, is unfortunately misrepresented in this novel.  Asperger's does not confer any advantages, despite our heroine's extraordinary feats; Aspberger's is a severely disabling disease which usually renders its victims perpetually dependent on caregivers and therapy.<br /><br />Most likely it occurred to Larsson that neither of his two stories had the critical mass required for a full length novel, and he found a way to combine them.  But the patching together left seams which are instantly visible and it is tempting to believe that he hadn't attempted to publish because he was not satisfied that the job was done.  The book's enormous commercial success is most likely due to the creative vengeance which the heroic journalist and little Miss Aspberger come up with to punish their criminally rich adversaries.'s is a severely disabling disease which usually renders its victims perpetually dependent on caregivers and therapy.

B00005KIVN|5.0|I loved the movie.  I bought the vhs at original full price. VHS is old technology.  I wish very much that I could have it on dvd in the US.  It is one of the movies I must watch at least twice a year, every year.  If I canot get it on DVD, I will not be able to continue watching it.  Magnificent woman, magnificent film.    It is more agout relationships than about dance, if there is a difference.  I have heard some call it \\"self-indulgent.\\" If that is so, please Sally, indulge yourself more; you do it so well.
B000A2UBN4|5.0|I disagree with the editors that the remake, which is arguably superior in every way to the original, is not even worth a look. No disrespect intended to Gregory Peck and Robert Mitchum who were both great actors who delivered solid performances in the original, but I prefer the 1991 version. For her role as Danielle Bowden, Lewis was nominated for an Oscar for Best Actress in a Supporting Role. The remake also features one of the greatest actors of all time, Robert DeNiro, and was directed by one of the greatest directors of all time, Martin Scorsese. That is to say nothing of the brilliant cinematography and soundtrack.     In the role of Sam Bowden, Nolte gives a convincing performance as a mild-mannered attorney who is knocked for a loop when his past comes back to haunt him. I give Nolte props for showing his range here. Instead of the stereotypical tough-guy part that he often finds himself in, Nolte as Sam Bowden is a 4-eyed wimp who doesn't even know how to handle a gun.     Take the scariest convict you've ever seen in a newspaper or on TV, magnify him 10x over, give him a very bad axe to grind and you've got DeNiro's Max Cady. With his deranged and (at least in his sick mind) scripturally-based vendetta tattooed on his flesh, he proclaims that he is here to \\"save\\" Sam Bowden and that he is going to \\"guide him through hell to reach his paradise.\\" DeNiro is like a master chess player, besting Sam at every turn.     The remake Bowdens are flawed and thus more believable--they are real people with real problems, unlike the original Bowdens who were an Any Family from Main Street America. In the remake, Sam Bowden cheats on his wife (and maybe in the courtroom). Leigh Bowden chain smokes, screams at her husband and dreams of a lover she doesn't have. Danielle Bowden hides in her room when her parents fight and gets busted for smoking pot. Max Cady is able to capitalize on the weaknesses of the individual family members, pitting them against each other and making them in turn more vulnerable to him and his schemes.    The stakes are also higher in the remake. In the original, Bowden served as a witness to Cady's crime. Scorsese changes the relationship between Cady and Bowden. The storyline is more complex since remake Bowden is not only Cady's attorney, but the attorney who abandoned him and sold him up the river. A larger issue is examined: The all-too-common problem of court-appointed defense attorneys who fail their clients. And while we examine Sam and Max, we also examine ourselves. Would we have done the same thing if we had been in Sam's place? Is there one member of the audience who feels sorry for Max Cady, even though maybe they should? There is a certain karmic satisfaction that after Sam failed Max, everyone around Sam is now failing Sam. As much as we loathe Max Cady we may not be so quick to side with Sam Bowden, either. Remake-Sam carries a heavy weight and for the severity of his transgression he must stand trial, literally.     Where Hero-Sam (Peck) did in the end what we expected him to do all along, Sinner-Sam (Nolte) redeems himself and is absolved of his guilt when his hands are washed clean in the raging river. God is missing in the original but arrogantly and pervertedly invoked by DeNiro's Cady. In the remake, God is in fact the only able-bodied character other than Max Cady. Force Majeure is an unforeseeable act of God that cancels all promises and obligations. And it is the act that saves Sam Bowden and his family. We find out that the villain's flesh-art and bellicose proclamations were, afterall, only the rantings of a lunatic. God is not on Cady's side.    I would recommend the original to someone who is in the mood to be entertained by a simple story about right and wrong. I would recommend the remake to someone who is in the mood to be entertained by a story about a situation so wrong only God can make it right.
B001P9KR8U|1.0|Having missed the theatrical release, I purchased a copy of Slumdog from the local Walmart on Tuesday, 31st March and watched the movie in the same evening.  Sadly all the special features were missing on the dvd, one of the main reasons for my buying it to see old Bomaby again. If the blog on dvd tells the consumers that there are special features, they should have been there. In this case, evidently the first major error in dvd history, FOX used the greed bait, just like the GM and AIG. We all know what happened to them. I think it is the responsibility of FOX to send a free dvd to all who purchased the defective version.   I took mine back for a refund.
B001P9KR8U|1.0|I preordered this DVD especially for the special features of commentary and making of documentary, as advertised. What I received, had none of that. E-mail from Amazon states that I could get a replacement from Fox, however e-mails are not responded to and since I ordered it shipped overseas, a phone call itself would cost as much as a new DVD would.    The movie itself is alright, but you can see the movie in cinemas. This DVD is not worth anyones time.
B001K3JF7K|5.0|This album surely stands out as one of the best Bossa Nova sounds. I love that the tracks have been slowed down for a more intimate and relaxing music. I was so used to bossa nova tempo for being fast and upbeat. This album is as great as other Bossa Nova albums such Rosemary Clooney's \\"Brazil\\", Peggy Lee's \\"Latin ala Lee\\" and \\"Ole ala Lee\\", Doris Day's \\"Latin for Lovers\\" and Joannie Sommers' \\"Softly, the Brazilian Sounds.\\"  This album is a a reminiscent of Francis Albert Sinatra & Antonio Carlos Jobim's Bossa Nova album. I surely love that the song \\"Too Marvelous for Words\\" has been arranged into a more soothing tempo. THE TITLE OF THE ALBUM IS \\"QUIET NIGHTS\\", IT SURELY FITS IT.
B001CTDH4Y|5.0|I have to give this five stars when the whole family enjoy's the movie. The dogs were cute and funny and it had an element of adventure. This was similar to Disney's Bolt but not as scary and sad.
B00004Y6O7|5.0|I will never forget the first time I heard the first track from this album, I about died (Mean Street). It hit me like a brick to the face. The brilliant creativity that Van Halen so kindly provided to their true blue legion of fans put the band at a whole new level of legendary status in the valley of greats. The album is creative, sinister, romantic, and raw. It's the Album that launched Van Halen on it's way to legendary status in the same way that Presence defined Led Zeppelin in 1977. Neither album was a commercial success in it's day, but both bands spent considerable amounts of time writing and recording each album. This album has more than stood the test of time, and the recording has respectively taken it's place in Rock God History. I would bet my house that this album is hands down the main reason that secured Van Halen's vote into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Simply put, my favorite Van Halen album, and their best ever.
B001DJ7PQ4|5.0|I love Doctor Who.....I am never disappionted.  :)  It just leaves me wanting more.
B000H7JD4A|3.0|Its not a bad album...My only real complaint is the songs average from 5 minutes to about 9 minutes long and about the first 2-3 minutes of each song is a slow melodic intro on almost every one....It kinda kills the fast metal pace when all songs have a slow intro and you have to wait to get into it. Plus the songs are very medium-fast paced... Nothing very speedy like their classic albums...
B001QWBM62|4.0|I won't list all of the things I like about the H4n; I agree with the other 5-star reviews as far as the hardware goes. Great unit.    However, the English documentation is awful.     - The language is barely understandable (obviously written by a non-native English speaker, maybe even using a translation engine).     - The graphic elements can be confusing because there are so many that are unnecessary and visually complex and confusing, and examples aren't placed where they belong (lots of useless ink).     - Explanatory text is sparse and hard to find. The index is not only inadequate, but I still haven't figured out how to find the page for any index citations; some sort of weird page referencing convention was used that isn't explained anywhere in the guide. Also, how the page numbering \\"works\\" is a mystery to me.    In short, if you need to rely on the guide to find out how to do things with the H4n, or as a reference, be prepared to be confused.    Shame, Zoom, for not having your documentation reviewed by a professional before releasing it!
B000VLE3IS|5.0|Not much to say other than this is a solid best-of collection remastered on 2 cds with 1 kick a-- dvd of incredible concert footage of one of the biggest and best rock 'n' roll bands in history at the peak of their power. Love Robert Plant's vocals, John Paul Jones is great, but Jimmy Page and John Bonham are freaks of nature. You know, I was in a bar on St. Patrick's this year and hip hop was blaring and I remarked to a friend that it has become the party music of the masses. More often than not you go into a bar where there are lots of young 20 and even 30 somethings and it's hip hop. Sometimes it's even worse whats playing and you get what passes for mainstream rock today. That sucks.
B001K3JF7K|5.0|\\"This album is a representation of who I am: a woman who's 44 and feels great about herself and her marriage and her kids.\\" ~ Diana Krall ~<br /><br />I welcome and embrace this latest offering from one of my favorite modern-day jazz divas with enthusiastic ears knowing that one of my favorite arrangers, Claus Ogerman, is in the picture. After the gigantic success of The Look of Love, I was really hoping for a follow-up album that will reunite Diana Krall and Claus Ogerman. I am extremely glad that they finally made it happen and it is worth the long wait. Like Nelson Riddle and Frank Sinatra, they are a proverbial match made in heaven - they truly bring out the best in each other.<br /><br />I've read an article written by Brian Truitt on the latest issue of \\"USA Weekend\\" that this album is Diana Krall's \\"love letter\\" to her hubby, Elvis Costello. It is indeed. The material is a charming and romantic mix of standards from the Great American Songbook and Brazilian Songbook plus two contemporary songs \\"Walk On By\\" and \\"How Can You Mend A Broken Heart\\" set into typical Claus Ogerman's lush arrangements and orchestrations that are endearing to the ears.<br /><br />Her sultry vocals and stunning piano techniques are backed by seasoned musicians who are my favorites as well - they are all \\"incredibly-mean\\" in their respective instruments: Anthony Wilson (guitar), John Clayton (bass), Jeff Hamilton (drums) and Paulinho da Costa (percussion), and not to mention a lush sixty-piece-orchestra that utilizes violins, celli, basses, alto/bass flutes, French horns, oboe, tuba and vibes.<br /><br />The album's musical ambiance is cool, light, breezy and inspiring from start to finish which is perfect for unwinding on quiet nights. Who could ever resist listening to these songs executed in the most relaxing and beguiling settings? I could foresee another Grammy-winning-album that starts off beautifully with one of Rodgers and Hart's treasures, \\"Where Or When\\" and wraps up with a fittingly-gorgeous-ender, Cole Porter's \\"Every Time We Say Goodbye.\\"<br /><br />There is no uninspiring track from this set, not even an obscure Brazilian song by Antonio Carlos Jobim, \\"Este Seu Olhar,\\" which becomes an ear-candy with her softly sweet rendition. The entire album is such a delight, all the songs are superbly interpreted most especially my favorites: \\"Too Marvelous For Words,\\" \\"Guess I'll Hang My Tears Out To Dry,\\" \\"Walk On By\\" and of course three of the most popular Bossa Nova staples and ultimate charmers - \\"The Boy From Ipanema,\\" \\"So Nice\\" and \\"Quiet Nights.\\"<br /><br />As the saying goes...\\"Beauty is in the ear of the beholder.\\" To my ears, this is an absolutely beautiful album that I wholeheartedly recommend for your listening pleasure of a lifetime. This is definitely among the top five that I adore from her discography along with When I Look in Your Eyes, The Look of Love, Love Scenes and From This Moment On.<br /><br />\\"Bossa Nova is more like a whisper than a scream.\\" ~ Anthony Wilson ~ter's \\"Every Time We Say Goodbye.\\"    There is no uninspiring track from this set, not even an obscure Brazilian song by Antonio Carlos Jobim, \\"Este Seu Olhar,\\" which becomes an ear-candy with her softly sweet rendition.

B001K3JF7K|1.0|I've been a big fan of Krall's up until the last couple of albums. I truly loved it when she recorded with small jazz groups; with that rich, powerful, agile, sophisticated voice of hers. I used to think she was the best jazz singer out there. She could give me goose bumps. But this album is just awful. First, I hate the syrupy orchestra arrangements. And, more worrying, what has happened to her voice? Is she purposely trying to sing in this whispery, hoarse, boring style? Or has something serious happened to her voice? I sure hope it's the former. Because my hope is that the old Diana will come back some day.
B00023B1LC|5.0|If you've read Robert Ludlum's The Bourne Identity, you won't see too much similarity to the book once Jason Bourne is fished out of the water. The only Carlos in this movie is in the (fortunately) deleted alternate opening.<br /><br />Although the Richard Chamberlain tv mini-series was more faithful to this book (at least until the last few minutes), this movie is much more exciting and likely to keep you on the edge of your seat. You don't want to miss it.<br /><br />The extras on this DVD sounded quite good, but were more pr for the movie than anything else. If you have a different version of the Matt Damon movie, don't pick this up just for the extras.<br /><br />If you haven't read [[ASIN:0553260111 The Bourne Identity (Bourne Trilogy, Book 1)]] be sure to pick up a copy. It's great reading.
B001NFNFNU|5.0|OMG!One of the best films I have ever seen.  This is truly Angelina Jolie's best film to date!  Bravo  I cried most of the movie.
B001PPGAIK|5.0|After I saw this movie in the theater, I decided that it was something that I MUST have for my collection when it was released in DVD.  In the meantime, Santa Claus brought me a new Sony KDL-46XBR8 1080p TV and a Sony Blu-ray S550 player to go with it.  So, when \\"Australia\\" was released in Blu-ray, that's what I bought.  To describe the movie in Blu-ray as \\"breathtaking\\" would be an understatement.<br /><br />In addition to memorable performances by Nichole Kidman and Hugh Jackman, the new child star, Brandon Walters, who plays the part of \\"Nullah,\\" will absolutely steal your heart.  The casting in the movie could not have been better.  The scenery is likewise \\"breathtaking.\\"<br /><br />I know that some critics took cheap shots at the movie, but after watching it now six times, it gets better with each viewing, and the Blu-ray high-definition will leave you mesmerized.  Once you see it, you will never forget it.
B0001ARCFA|4.0|These were my first foray into \\"high end\\" headphones.  After breaking 3 pairs of $20-40 headphones during the last year I decided to spend some $ on quality (the construction of these is very good).  On first listen, these were very clear but not as much bass or volume as I expected.  I would describe them as very \\"accurate\\" - they don't add extra bass or treble.  Listening to them on my iPod shuffle and touch I found them a little quiet; Apple's headphones could blast at 10/10, while the little iPods could only drive these to maybe 7/10.  However, there is no way I can go back to listening to Apple's headphones; compared to these they sound like mud.  Also, MP3s ripped at 128k sound like lousy, even at 320k I can hear differences from the original CDs.  These cans have vinyl coverings that make my ears sweat after a while.  Overall, I am pleased but am tempted to spend a little more to try the Beyerdynamic DT770s.

B001P9KR8U|4.0|I love Danny Boyle to death, and nearly everything that he's done that's seen the light of day.  From Shallow Grave, to Trainspotting, to 28 Days Later, to Millions, to Sunshine; he's always managed to deliver visually striking, hypnotic, and intelligent films.  Slumdog Millionaire has proved to be Boyle's most celebrated film yet, as the Oscar darling has captured the hearts and minds of viewers across the globe.  As a fan of Boyle's work, I can honestly say that I'm not in love with it as much as everyone else seems to be, but that aside, Slumdog Millionaire remains a powerful film that should be seen whether you be a Boyle fan or not.  With all the attention it has received, going into the film's storyline would only seem redundant at this point, but what I will say is that Slumdog Millionaire finds Boyle at his technical best.  The editing, sound design, and music are beautifully done, and the film manages to keep a kinetic pace throughout its two hour running time as well.  All in all, while I don't think Slumdog Millionaire was quite the masterpiece that a majority of viewers do, it is a powerful, engaging, and incredibly compelling work that will stay with you after the credits roll, and is by all means definitely worth seeing.
0385339089|5.0|Grisham kept me turning pages with this awesome book.  The story of 11 year old Mark Sway was gripping.  I couldn't put it down.  The ending was awesome and it choked me up.
B001K3JF7K|5.0|This album is one you can rely on for romance. Lush orchestrations, languid vocals, and tinkling piano keys are what you want to hear late at night when, with a cocktail in hand, you are preparing to seduce that special someone. You won't find vocal or pianistic fireworks here, and this may disappoint some fans, but Krall isn't aiming to distract from the dreamy Brazilian mood she introduces with the first track on this album and maintains until the very end. As always, she adapts herself to the theme at hand. Because this CD is a tribute to the samba, she comes across as a cool drink of water rather than a hot mama. Take a sip. It's intoxicating.
0143038419|5.0|Great reading for a woman, especially, if you are still young and have unresolved emotional issues..But also helps to understand  the deeper meaning of meditation and yoga philosophy.
0525951113|4.0|Daniel Suarez may be one of the most insightful writers in today's market.  He weaves a storyline that keeps you turning pages and appeals to the technical side that all of us encounter in our daily lives.  His book, pray not, may be the warning we need for the world ahead of us.  I highly recommend it.
B001NFNFF8|3.0|As an avid fan of all things James Lee Burke, I snapped up this DVD as soon as it hit, only to be disappointed by lethargic directing and muddled plot development.  Tommy Lee Jones (another triumvirate name) is a solid Dave R., but the rest of the cast, especially the guy playing the alcoholic movie star, didn't pass muster.  The dream/hallucination scenes with the \\"Confederate dead\\" just seemed awkward.  Someday, hopefully, someone will do Mr. Burke's novels justice in the translation to film.  Finally, the Blu-ray quality was fine, but there are zero extras on the disc; I was hoping for an interview with J. L. B.

B001K3JF7K|2.0|This new Diana Krall CD should come with a warning on the cover: Do not listen to this CD while driving. Now I love Miss Krall and have everything that she has recorded, however Quiet Nights is not her best outing. Most of the songs are played so slow that you will fall asleep listening to them. And the songs that do try for a more upbeat tempo really miss the mark. This CD was advertised as a Bossa Nova CD, however, none of the songs actually play a Bossa Nova (or Samba)tempo. The vocals sound as if she was half asleep while recording and do nothing to highlight her wonderful voice. I would have prefered a larger rhythm section and no strings.

I've been doing level one for a few weeks and it was hard at first (stamina-wise) but my body has definitely built up it's stamina and I'm already seeing results.  You need a mat and hand weights for this dvd.

There are not many movies that one can compare to this classic; and there are not too many actresses that are as pretty as Ingrid Bergman and as handsome as Humphrey Bogart.

B001N18HOQ|5.0|Oldtimers know that Pearl Jam would never rip off their fans with unnecessary reissues, so rest assured that this package offers special goodies to its intended audience - hardcore fans with a collector's mindset. If you have a few hundred of the official bootlegs then you're in the market for the upcoming wave of reissues of the original albums. Here the immortal TEN definitely gets the deluxe treatment.<br /><br />The item that excited me the most here is the DVD of PJ's memorable 1992 appearance on MTV Unplugged, in which the longer-haired, better-dressed, and much moodier young PJ brought down the house. Last I saw this it was on a grainy and distorted old VHS tape a whole mess of years ago. Recall that TEN didn't become truly huge until nearly a year after it was released, and was still on the upswing at the time of the broadcast. The MTV Unplugged show is a unique historical memento showing a soon-to-be-enormous band at a crucial moment, and their talent and passion were already roaring out of the gate.<br /><br />The other item of interest here is the new remixed version of TEN by later PJ producer Brendan O'Brien. The reason TEN has always sounded different than all the later albums is the reverb-heavy original mix from producer Rick Parashar, which sounded a bit murky but gave the album the huge anthemic sound that appealed to the masses. I agree with many fans that you shouldn't mess with history, and if it ain't broke don't fix it. It would help if everyone viewed the TEN remix not as a replacement for the original, but as a variation. O'Brien's remix removes a lot of unnecessary sludge, which brings the contributions of Mike McCready and Jeff Ament into sharper relief and makes Eddie Vedder sound more human. The sound is crisper overall and the remix is mostly pretty subtle. The only truly substantive changes I can detect are in \\"Once,\\" \\"Why Go,\\" and \\"Porch\\" which sound less metallic and more garage-y. I'm not sure if those songs actually sound better in the new remix, but they are cleaner.<br /><br />As for the six leftovers added to the remix CD, there is some historical interest to be found. \\"Brother\\" (with vocals - an instrumental version appeared on the Lost Dogs compilation) and \\"Just a Girl\\" are intriguing for historically-minded PJ fans. There's a little less interest in early demo versions of the great soundtrack items \\"Breath and a Scream\\" (later re-titled \\"Breath\\") and \\"State of Love and Trust.\\" The final versions of those songs are better. And you can avoid the cheeky studio jams \\"2,000 Mile Blues\\" and \\"Evil Little Goat\\" - serious fanatics already know about PJ's improv habits from all of those collectible bootlegs.<br /><br />But in the end, the true greatness of this reissue is the love that PJ have for their fans. This may or may not be better than the original, but it's surely more of an awesome thing. [~doomsdayer520~]but they are cleaner.

B000641Z90|5.0|I love watching this DVD.  I bought it for my father and I guess I am going to have to buy my own.
B001GZ6QEC|5.0|Loved this movie. Action/drama/in-depth characters and makes you wanting more.<br /><br />I cannot say anything bad about this movie except for 2 things. 1. batman's voice? wtf happened? You can hardly hear the man when he *tries* to talk. Yes, I understand he is hiding his identity by changing his voice but if you are trying to strike fear into the hearts of criminals. They need to know what you are saying to them. 2. Gary Oldman when he talks. Some scenes he is just mubbling gibberish. wtf too. Don't believe me. There is a scene where he goes and talks to Harvey Dent in his office. Gary tells Harvey something, and I was surprised Harvey responded back. lol. Let me know what you hear from that guy. Basically, its a movie where you watch in the theater, and a nice rental too for home if you don't like the movie ticket prices these days.
B001K3JF7K|5.0|Its worth 5 stars BUT I have 5 CD/DVD of Dianas & 13 CD's of Claus I love them both very much BUT with all that BRAZIL & the world of POP has to offer from the banks of yester years to present time why an old style CD for after 12 midnight? Its just to close to \\"OLD\\" DK & CO I expected something NEW from both conducter & singer, they have the ability!!! Hope the DVD shows up better???  The second day and the Cd is weaving its magic! my partner loves it so maybe give it time not with standing I do wish it was 2009 not a repeat of yester years (a marketing blunder!!!)
B00064WSN2|5.0|I will go on record as saying that although 'In the Wake of Poseidon' does follow the style of 'In the Court of the Crimson King', it is still an excellent album.  Heavy on the mellotron, soothing to the ear, with the exception of the raucous 'Cat Food'.  The extra tracks (single version of Cat Food and Groon) are nice although the former doesn't seem all that necessary.  This was Greg Lake's last outing with Crimso as well as for Giles and MacDonald, and our last glimpse of what this combo is capable of.     The cd itself is rendered in high definition cd format and sounds wonderful.  The liner notes are a nice glimpse of the band at the time of the recording, with the transition of 3 members out and the inclusion of Collins and Haskell.    I'm a long time King Crimson fan, so I am biased, but I think this cd is definitely worth your hard earned cash.
B00005QW5X|5.0|I know that may seem like a lofty statement but I love this movie.  Better than the Rocky Horror Picture Show by a mile and I have seen that about 100 times in the theaters with live actors.  This movie played for quite some time as a live stage performance as well and in blew me away.  The sound track stands up on it's own and the performances of the characters in the movie is wonderful.  Pick it up, you won't be disappointed.
B000TGJ80I|4.0|I finally upgraded to Blu Ray on Underworld I have all the movies in the series except the lastest which I will have as soon as it is released. Great detail and really special special effects, I really fall in love with the beautiful MS Beckinsale in this movie very well done.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Amazing show. A friend bought this set, and I watched it for the first time. The only negative thing I have to say about it, is it was cancelled.
B0016Q2D5M|3.0|it was ok, kind of fun to watch being in 3D but u still see weird colors when you're watching it and it seems like the 3D animation wasn't done that well. I watched a 3D movie when I was in disneyland and it was done much better.   The story line started out well enough but as the movie went on it got more and more unrealistic, to the point I was pretty much taken out of the movie and just laughed at how ridiculous it was. I would recommend this movie for children.
B00005QENZ|5.0|This is the second time I have bought this CD. The first one got lost in a divorce. It still sounds just as good the second time around. The songs are all classic Aerosmith. I had to have it bad enough to buy it twice.
B001GZ6QBU|5.0|This is a Batman / Joker pair that made me sit on the edge on my seat all through the movie, as I went there under an invite from my baby girl...(32 years old).  I NEVER Never, go out to see movies, esp. Batman movies as I am sick and tired of \\"Bad efforts\\" with Visual Specialties in them.<br /> The Joker always got me peed off as there never was one that made any bleeding sense to me, and my attention was lost on the first preview of the next movie of \\"POPCORN-AD\\"~!<br />  But, Heath Ledger knocked my socks off as there will never be anyone that can take that part and make \\"HIM\\" the hero of the story~!~<br /> He said all he wanted was Batman off of the streets as HE was the reason for the violence..true!and that was it...the money was given back to the bank as The Insurance Co. covered it, and only the bad guys really got killed, although the D.A. did get a bad burn in the end, but it was Batman that made the choice to stay at the jailhouse and beat The Joker to a pulp!<br /> The story plot was fair, but from DC COMICS, what do ya want?

Plus the only things destroyed were from Batman's daily wrecks on the city.<br />  His opening line to the Black Mob-bosses about their \\"balls\\" cracked me up a bit, as he was so \\"SERIOUSSS\\" as he disapproved of their lack of spine or backbone (paraphrased).<br /> I was saddened by the news of this guy's death, but he brought this onto himself, another gift from HOLLYWOOD!<br /> But I applaud his representation of the \\"Joker\\" the best ever, no \\"pows-bings-splats-\\"underarm-farts\\"-pows-bangs, etc.\\" Thank God!He was the best, but Batman's voice needs cough-drops~!<br />Fourstrings-Rickabout their \\"balls\\" cracked me up a bit, as he was so \\"SERIOUSSS\\" as he disapproved of their lack of spine or backbone (paraphrased).

B000AYEIZY|5.0|I truly believe they have gotten better with age. One of the best CDs of the year for me.
B000V658EQ|5.0|I've had this album since its release in 1971. First on vinyl, then on cassette, and now on CD. It's one album I definitely could not be without. Every song is a perfection of arrangement, vocals, music and lyrics.<br /><br />Today marks the 25th anniversary of Marvin's death but he lives on in his music. I miss you Marvin! [April 2, 1939 - April 1, 1984]
0810979772|5.0|Thye loved it and read it over and over. All the books are very funny and this one is a little interactive (children have to complete parts). This series was a blessing for me becasue my 6 and half discovered the pleasure of reading. Highly recommended.
B00003CXC6|1.0|In Kurosawa's examination of good and evil, he missed the point, namely, that all men are evil.  This is a film which featured four different accounts of a rape and murder, seeing it from different points of drunkeness.  There are several reasons why this film is painful to watch. The first reason is the childish cinematography.  I have a somewhat ambivalent reaction to it. Though the film is entertaining if the audience is gassed with sleeping fumes.
B00005JLSE|5.0|The product arrived on time and was in perfect condtion! Would certianly purchase from this seller again!
031237593X|4.0|In the great TV show \\"Blackadder II,\\" set in the 1500s, there is a scene where Blackadder visits the home of an old crone.  There is a woman standing outside.  Blackadder asks her, \\"Is this the home of the old crone?\\"  The woman cackles, \\"That it be, sir, that it be!\\"  Blackadder, disgusted, replies, \\"Just say 'Yes it is!'  'Yes it is!'\\"  He is clearly fed up with this old-tyme grammatical construction, and frankly, so am I.  Penman's characters talk like this...\\"This be the most dangerous undertaking yet, Ned!\\"  It's awkward to read and unnecessary.    Otherwise I quite enjoyed the story, as well as most of her other works.  But this is grating enough that I had to remove a star.    (By the way, the old crone in Blackadder immediately drops the stilted talk and begins to speak to him normally.)
B001MYIXAW|1.0|I rented the Blu-ray from Netflix and was appalled at the translation.  Thank God I didn't order it from Amazon, like I had planned.  If Amazon does not have some way to tell if it's the theatrical version on its website, I will not be purchasing it from them even after the issue is resolved.<br /><br />If people who know better do not stand up and not put their money into these shoddy products, we will continue to be screwed.
B001R4MEYS|5.0|Now that I have had a good week to absorb the album and sink my teeth into it, I can honestly say that this is the best Mastodon Album to date and I consider myself a big fan and own all their material. If you are looking for brutal and angry, short blasts of molten metal songs, look to the older stuff. If you are looking for a well thought out, layered album that has many twist and turns and really shows off the brilliance of the four personalities coming together and pouring all their creativity and imagination into somewhat of a dare I say it \\"concept album\\" Then you will truly enjoy this. They dial back the distortion a little bit but not the intensity and display the most intricate and detailed songs they have ever written. The reason I hesitate to compare this album to concept albums of the past is because usually I think of stuffiness and over the top grandiose from those types of records, this on the other hand has a very natural flowing feel and does not feel forced or contrived in any way. This is the type of album that at first listen you might say it's alright, but by several listens you will consider it a masterpiece. And the funny part about it is that although the songs are long, it does not feel long overall but instead seems very short. There is a definite classic rock prog feel on some parts but it never feels like you are listening to 70's bands but instead something that is very modern and present.<br /><br />I was very leery of hearing that there would be keyboards, but they are done in such a way, that they totally fit the songs and are more of an accent in the background. The track \\"Ghost of Karelia\\" at some parts reminds me of a hint of something off the Voivod Nothingface album. \\"Divinations\\" is the shortest song and sounds the most like the older material but even at that they add a different feel and there is a surf guitar sounding solo that Brent Hinds rips on, but it doesn't sound like traditional surf but is mastodonized and fits the song perfectly. The CZAR and Crack the sky are Epic songs, that im not going to even get into, you will have to listen yourself to experience it.<br /><br />The Deluxe edition with the DVD is the way to go and is worth the price by itself, proving to be very entertaining and inspirational.<br /><br />Even though 2009 is only 4 months in I'm going to say this will probably be album of the year on many lists. A truly amazing record overall that I know I will be listening to many times and can't wait to see them Live!ectly.

B001N18HOQ|5.0|The Brendan O'Brien mix is brilliant, the bonus tracks rock, and experiencing a DVD of the best MTV Unplugged episode ever of one of the greatest bands ever in surround sound is a joy, \\"State of Love and Trust\\" is a highlight. I was most definitely a Nirvana fan over Pearl Jam back in the nineties yet must say the musicianship here is exceptional, imho this is easily an improvement over the original release. Fantastic, highly recommended.
B001L51RQE|5.0|Absolutely stunning. The videography and the performance of this concert were perfect. Sting and the guys have never sounded better! Sting doesn't seem to age at all!

B001X9O2DI|4.0|A live-action Terry Pratchett movie is either doomed to fail in every way, or succeed in practically everything.<br /><br />And \\"The Colour of Magic,\\" adapted from the first two novels in Pratchett's brilliant Discworld series, is more the former than the latter. This one is no \\"Hogather\\" -- it has rather slack direction at times -- but it preserves Pratchett's wry satirical sense of humour. And of course, it's all about a mercenary, cowardly failed wizard.<br /><br />Rincewind (David Jason) is ejected from the Unseen University, on the very day that Twoflower (Sean Astin) arrives with his many-legged Luggage. He's come to the Disc... to \\"look at it.\\" But after Rincewind tries to con Twoflower, the Patrician (Jeremy Irons) orders Rincewind to be the guide/bodyguard of the Disc's first ever tourist.<br /><br />After a massive fire sweeps through the city, the two end up fleeing Ankh-Morpork and running into all sorts of weird things -- a very assertive magic sword, a floating island full of see-through dragons, a dramatic dragonlady in a leather bikini, astrozoologists trying to determine Great A'Tuin's gender, the aged Cohen the (retired) Barbarian, druids, and even getting thrown clear off the Disc in a strange spacecraft. And you thought YOU had problems.<br /><br />Unfortunately the Unseen University is having troubles of its own -- the magical book Octavo is acting weird, and power-hungry Trymon (Tim Curry) is scheming against the Archchancellor. Even worse, a strange red star has appeared in the sky, and the world is facing destruction. The only thing that can save it is the spell in Rincewind's head.<br /><br />Perhaps it's because it's based on the first, roughest Discworld books, but \\"Colour of Magic\\" is not quite as funny or tightly-written as its predecessor, \\"Hogather.\\" The writing is not quite as complex or as witty, and the direction sometimes feels a bit slack (such as the bar fight scene, or Trymon skulking and schemind around the University).<br /><br />But despite these drawbacks, \\"Colour of Magic\\" is still a vastly entertaining story -- it has a solid plotline and it chugs away nicely after a somewhat sluggish beginning, and blossoms into full-out complexity about halfway through. Once it gets underway it starts to resemble a road-trip through fantasy-land, with our quirky tourist and wizard bungling their way across the Disc.<br /><br />Along the way there's some fun action (an upside-down duel), humorous dialogue (\\"You weren't born with a mysterious birthmark in the shape of a crown, were you?\\"), and a general air of tongue-in-cheekness. Best of all, it's a fantasy spoof -- Vadim Jean preserves Pratchett's clever satire aimed at the staples of your average fantasy: fantasy babes, prophecies, magic swords, retired barbarians, powerful artifacts, and even the idea of reality warping itself to save the \\"hero.\\"<br /><br />Jason is wonderfully snivelly and sour as Rincewind, a failed wizard who basically finds himself repeatedly swept up into bizarre, deadly circumstances even though he didn't want to be involved. Astin is even better as the hilariously oblivious Twoflower, who regards every disaster as yet another great adventure (\\"We're going to run out of world!\\" \\"I have to see that!\\").<br /><br />And there's a talented supporting cast -- Curry chews the scenery with sneering aplomb, Karen David plays a humorously over-the-top dragon-lady, and Irons has a small but wonderful role as the chilly, efficient Vetinari. And of course, the brilliant Christopher Lee takes over as an increasingly disappointed Death.<br /><br />\\"Colour of Magic\\" isn't as tightly directed as it could have been, but it still manages to be clever and quite amusing.c\\" is still a vastly entertaining story -- it has a solid plotline and it chugs away nicely after a somewhat sluggish beginning, and blossoms into full-out complexity about halfway through.

1567184855|5.0|I was familiar with the subject mater in this book having read Ruth Montgomery's 'A World Beyond' back in the 70's.  However, this one goes into much more detail about what happens to us when we depart this life.  What makes this book so much more believable is that the author has a PHD in psychology so he takes a more scientific approach to the subject.  It's a fascinating read and I highly recommend it.  Personally, I have purchased extra copies for friends and family. I want them to know what's in store for them when the time comes.  One word of caution:  Once you read it you will never look at the world, your religion, or the people in your life the same again.  But that's a good thing.  Please don't waste anymore time, buy this book and more importantly read it.

0671015206|4.0|This book lives up to its hype in that it provides some great information on how to create wealth in an entertaining and easy to read guide. If you want some solid strategies that go into more specifics then this book, I highly recommend [[ASIN:0965629252 Nobody's Fool: A Skeptic's Guide to Prosperity]]by Al Jacobs ([...]) Mr. Jacobs provides the real life tools we need, particularly in today's economy to protect our assets and build solid financial security...and you don't have to be a millionaire to make it happen.
B000OLGCHA|2.0|After the wonderful and fun soundtrack for Goblet of Fire, I was excited to finally add this 5th one to my collection. What a waste of money. Unless I am playing it at the highest volume level, tracks 4 through 11 are barely audible on my car stereo. (My car is new so it's NOT my speakers.) Those tracks are so boring I finally just downloaded 4 songs on my own, Fireworks, Flight of the Order of the Phoenix, Professor Umbridge, and Love Ones and Leaving,  and threw the original cd in a drawer. I even went back and watched the movie again this week on HBO paying particular attention to the soundtrack, and I was right, someone really didn't give a whole lot of thought to the music for this movie. Sound effects are great, but if you plan to release a CD with music, put some music in it! Yes, some of it needs to be dark to fit what's happening on screen, but GEE, throw in some bit of lightness if you plan to release a movie soundtrack! This one stinks! I could find at least 5 scenes that would have been great for a 15 second light piece of music that could have been expanded for the soundtrack version. SAVE your money, or at least sample every track before you buy this.
B00008977N|5.0|I do believe that this is one of the Best Live concerts I have ever had the pleasure to have seen. So much thought went into the production aspect of the beautiful music written by the great Peter Gabriel. I don't see how anyone could be let down by this wonderful show.

B001KOFH2G|5.0|Serenity, the movie follow up to the fox TV series Firefly.<br />If you're into the series, you'll like the film.  Joss Whedon was really able to bring out the much darker side, which was the intention of the series, but had to be more 'user friendly' according to fox's standards.<br /><br />If you've grown attached to the characters through Firefly, you may be a little saddened by some of the movie's approaches.  I don't want to ruin it.<br /><br />Two thumbs up, great film.
142312166X|5.0|This is a great book for young readers.  I am a middle school teacher and I recommend this book to students who are fans of the Percy Jackson books.  It contains three fun short stories that develop the characters of this great series even more.  I read the book in one sitting and I have enjoyed going through it again.

0525421033|5.0|If I Stay is a bittersweet memory of a family and their loved ones. It's told through the eyes of Mia, who watches herself being treated in the hospital as her loved ones surround her. And she has to make the toughest choice of all...<br /><br />I really love the way the story was told, while Mia is watching over her own body in the hospital she is reminded of memories of her family and friends and through that we got to know them better. It was beautiful how the story of her life unfolds. I absolutely adored her family and friends, everyone was their own character with specific traits and quirks, and what a loving family as well! That made me that much more emotionally invested in the story, they seemed so real.<br /><br />For as much as this book falls into the heartbreaking and sad category it was actually rather funny at times! It made the book so much easier for me to read. I also loved how much music played a part of the story, Mia with her cello, her boyfriend Adam with his band and her father's days in a band as well. Music was a beautiful background for this story.<br /><br />All in all a bittersweet and rewarding book! I'm not always one for sad books but recently I've been finding out that there are some I actually really love and this is definitely one of them!

0060926317|5.0|It is entirely appropriate for most of you 'legalists' to have, once again, missed the whole point of this remarkable book. You missed it in Celestine Prophecy and once again in Peaceful Warrior...hell, most of you missed it in 'The Greatest Story Ever Told'.<br />It has been said that 'People don't know what they don't know, and they don't know that they don't know it'. If the only thing Marlo came to realize, even through the writing of this alleged 'fictional account', was that Western civilization is the lowest form of life that has ever existed on planet earth...she is spot-on!<br />The greed, corruption, and self interest of modern society is rapidly coming to a close...imploding upon itself.<br />From the Aborigines to the American Indian, the 'ancient ways' have sustained and quenched the thirst of their souls while American and European 'agendas' have fostered war, ecologic and psychological imbalance and destruction of the planet. The 'sheeple', brainwashed in their schools have gleefuly followed these ideals, following nose to tail while deep inside their hearts have ached for something more.<br /><br />Like the Pharisees and Sadducees, Chris Sitka has given us an extremely detailed account of the errors in Marlo's book which leaves us many questions. Here in the states, there are many different branches of different tribes with many different customs...and within each of these are elders with differing philosophies. I doubt there is an American Indian scholar alive that can keep track of every single belief made up of every single life experience. Could this have been Marlo's experience?<br />And as a 'foreigner' in a strange land would it not be common for some of us to err in names and descriptions given to hundreds of thousands of things and places that indigenous folks have labeled for themselves?<br /><br />And finally, is it not possible that the whole reason the book was written, was for spiritual enlightenment, and that the reason Marlo retractedsome of it's authenticity was to squelch the controversy which was poisoning the message? Did she not in fact 'kick the dust from her heels' to those who would not receive it?<br /><br />Only you dear reader can decide. Do you hear the 'cattle-call' or the trumpet?
B000AARKOO|5.0|I found this to be an extremely well done and inspiring epic of the Crusades and some of the things that have been ignored for so long about the realities of those times.  Orlando Bloom, as always, is brilliant in his role and the other actors and actresses only add substance to his character by their great performances.  The cinematography is beautifully done.  Kingdom of Heaven is a keeper to be viewed again and again.
B001K7QAB0|5.0|This was a very easy transaction, the seller is awesome and my audiobook was in perfect condition.
B000EHRXKO|4.0|As was mentioned by other reviewers, some of the songs are cut short, notably Heart of Glass & Rapture which are each 30 seconds shorter than the LP versions.  Since the CD fills only 73-1/2 minutes, there is no excuse for shaving a minute.  Maybe they thought we wouldn't notice?  But what is really inexcusable is omitting Once I Had A Love (aka The Disco Song) which is only 3:18 minutes and helped define the disco sound, for which there was plenty of room.  Bang A Gong (Get It On) should also have been included and there would have been room for it in lieu of Island Of Lost Souls or End To End, both trivial contributions.
0930289234|5.0|I bought it because everyone said i should read it before seeing the movie.  Now that i read it, i can't bring myself to see the movie, there is no way anything on film matched the intensity and depth of this book.
B001PPGAIA|5.0|It starts a little slow but gets very good.  It is certainly an epic, as it covers a descent period of time, but it is quite good.

B001MCBEQY|5.0|It is not wonder that George Orwell became anti-communist. He himself experienced communist purges in Barcelona in June 1937. This book describes these and other events of the Spanish Civil War.
0790731940|5.0|I find this movie as funny now as when it first came out. Mel Gibson, James Garner and Jodie Foster are completely charming and wonderful to watch. It is simply a good time for a couple of hours. Not deep. Not thought provoking. Just a good time and a good chuckle.
B000LXH0AE|5.0|LOVE THIS MOVIE.  PHENOMENAL CAST. FUNNY,SAD AND INSIGHTFUL. NOT FOR EVERYONE, THOUGH.  WOULD BE FOR PEOPLE WHO LIKE \\"SENSE AND SENSIBILITY\\" OR \\"BIG FISH\\" (MAYBE)
0756404746|1.0|I cannot, for the life of me, understand why Mr. Rothfuss' debut novel is so popular when so terrible.  The main character (Kvothe) is nothing short of a Mary Sue -- he's an expert at everything he does even though he's 15 and lived three years of his life as a street urchin.  Secondly, the plot is completely non-existent. The first 450 pages are beyond boring.  Nothing happens.  Kvothe lives, he talks to people, he tells us he's amazing. That's it. There's nothing compelling in Rothfuss' characterization of Kvothe (or of any of his other characters) to keep the reader plugged in (this is actually one of the few books in my life that I almost stopped reading).      Finally, it's overwritten and Rothfuss' writing is just plain AWFUL. His dialog (what little there is of it) is stilted and gives the reader little insight into the characters and so (as is typical of poor writers) he subjects the reader to explanatory dialog tags EVERYWHERE (Kvothe said insistently / she replied begrudginly, he answered enthusiastically). These are the calling cards of awful writers.      The \\"romance\\" between Kvothe and Denna suffers under Rothfuss' mediocre writing skills as well.  He spends page upon page TELLING the reader how in love Kvothe is with Denna, how amazing this girl is, how her eyes are capable of inspiring every man, but because Rothfuss' characters are so weak and his dialog is so awful, he's never capable of SHOWING a real connection between Kvothe and Denna and she never comes across as more than a flat character.  Therefore the reader no longer believes in Kvothe the narrator (which is to say, the reader also stops believing in Rothfuss the writer).      I could go on flogging this awful work, but I won't. All I'll say is avoid this, and avoid whatever steaming pile Rothfuss delivers as Book II of this series.
B001FB55Y4|5.0|This has been another amazing film from Guy Ritchie that never seems to fail, in my eyes at least, with coming up with unforgettable characters and twisting plot lines. One of the great things really stood out to me, other than the brilliant cast, was the way he seamlessly goes through all of plots and subplots about the ever increasing rise to change the way London hasn't been changed for quite a long time.  And not only that, the humor in the movie made it all the better in my eyes. I have been watching his movie ever since Snatch came out on VHS, which no longer works for some reason. Never the less, it was refreshing to see the Wild Bunch as a close group of mates who are all out there to make money and expand, while always looking out for each other. His most previous movie, Layer Cake, was truly a great movie as well, but it really lacked any humor as a driving force, which did wonders for the film. But to get back into the roots of adding just the right amount of hilarious dialogue while also making the story line really progress without getting bogged down with so much detail, you'd need a second viewing to understand what is really going on.  So I must say, if you're a Guy Ritchie fan, pick up this movie to your collection, and with the wonderful lot of actors he has chosen, this will be one movie I hope he makes at least a part two, because the ending does leave the possibility of bringing all the great characters into another movie. A++
B001R7IHA0|5.0|This is an absolute must get cd. From beginning to end, it is filled with unbelievable songs! It's like a greatest hits album!

B001DJ7PR8|1.0|All I can say is this was a really boring and dumb movie.  If I could give zero stars, I would.  I am glad I borrowed it from the library, so I didn't spend any money on it.  I like some of Woody Allen's stuff, but this was a pointless film.
0143038419|4.0|I was completely torn by my feelings toward this book. All through the \\"Eat\\" section, I was enamored by Elizabeth's humor and sympathetic to her heartbreak and happy for her new found love and a little jealous about her life in Italy.  In the \\"Pray\\" section it struck me - she is unable to construct a sentence that does not contain \\"I, me or my.\\"  I fully realize this is a memoir, but I got  tired of reading about how smart & friendly she is and, well, everybody just likes her. And Richard from Texas kind of bothered me a little.  I'm from Texas, I live about 60 minutes from Austin (where he is from) and well, we really don't talk like that.   We are fully capable of intelligent original thoughts that aren't summed up in some sort of canned \\"all tied up,\\" pseudo-insightful phrases.      Another thing that made me wonder a bit -- she mentions that she lost most/all  of her money in her divorce - so how did she finance this trip?  Another reviewer suggested she got an advance from her publisher - so would that make this book a little contrived?  I know this is a picky point, but it still held in the back of my mind as a read about her spiritual journey.     Okay, sorry for that fuss-fest-- the book really is wonderful.  Elizabeth Gilbert is a super skilled, articulate, humorous, insightful writer.  She is bright and sparkly and brilliant.  I highly recommend this for adventurers, anyone who is searching for their true self, anyone who travels alone, or anyone who has a heart.

B001TH16DI|5.0|...While I understand the disappointment of some regarding the version of the films being offered in their first BD version, there's a lot to be said about the nostalgia of seeing the original, theatrical version in BD clarity.  While I'm a big fan of Wise's vision, I can't WAIT to see the version that I haven't seen since \\"Sit Long and Prosper\\" (give yourself a hand if you remember--and sat through--that).     Also, keep in mind that arguably the BEST film in the bunch WAS completely restored, specifically for this release.       I can't get my hands ON this fast enough...
B000002AGE|5.0|I was already a Weather Report fan when this album was originally released in 1977. After hearing it for the first time, I immediately called it the best album I've ever heard.    I don't speak in terms of \\"bests\\" anymore, but 32 years after its original release, it is still my favorite album of all time. An absolute masterpiece.
B000005YZM|5.0|I still get chills down my spine when I hear the voice of Colin Blunstone. So much that I had gone to see them twice in as many years. The last time was The Trump Marina in Brigantine,N.J. What a performance, like a fine wine aged to perfection. Sorry Colin I am not knocking your age,I am in the same bracket. I own,no lie, seven copies of the lp/cd Odyssey and Oracle. One is the original vinyl domestic on Date Records, one came in a Zombies cd box set titled \\"Zombie Heaven\\",the original Repertoire release,one cd on Rhino,the Thirtieth Anniversary Edition on Big Beat(UK),a Japanese mini-lp sleeve edition and oops I don't have it yet,but, has been ordered, the fortieth anniversary concert edition. Am I crazy? Then, I own the original vinyl edition of Begin Here on British Decca,a Japanese mini-lp sleeve version on cd,the original cd released on Repertoire and another German import on Line Records. Add to them,the Five Live Zombies cd,a collection called \\"The Singles - A's and B's\\" and lastly,but certainly not leastly, The Return of the Zombies on RCA from Germany and Live at the Bloomsbury Theatre. Now, I ask you, do you think I like the Zombies?

B00003CXB2|5.0|What can I say?  A David Lean directed film.  That says it all.
B00004SYZ8|5.0|A reviewer describes this as 'house meets jazz' and as such this is an exceptional cd.  However it is distinctly NOT for the jazz purist.  The tunes are bluesy, modal, funky, and (mostly) danceable.  Granting that some of the rhythm tracks are sequenced, the instrumental work here is good to great.  There is a lot of soloing and it all succeeds... not too flashy, with emphasis on tastefulness.  The mixture of soloists --xylophone, sax, trumpet, keyboard, flute, and guitar-- keeps things varied (the flute, guitar and xylophone are outstanding).  The heart of this cd for myself lies in tracks 4 to 9, so I moved the first 3 tracks to the back end on hard drive.  \\"Sure Thing\\" (which first brought me here) is a sultry, smokey vamp over which the guitarist just burns.
B00005JPS8|5.0|Robert Downey Jr. plays Tony Stark, a prodigy who is following in his father's footsteps. He is a billionare playboy. Billionare Tony Stark had reality hit him like a ton of bricks.  He was able to portray that we are all vulnerable, no matter our circumstances, money or no money.   Stark (of course this representation of Stark isn't exactly like the comic novel) represents the wishful thinking of many Americans.  Iron Man was well balanced between comic relief and emotional drama.  I enjoyed it, well, then again I am in my early 20s :-]
B0015DWJX2|5.0|The main story line is a nice compact girl meets boy story.  All the story lines that twist around it makes it a haunting story.  Reading this story has made me think hard about my family and the hardships people went through during WWII and left me wondering if any of us have the determination and drive to live through such events? It has certainally been thought provoking.  Wonderfully written, I enjoyed reading it so much that I also puchased it on audible.

1582701709|1.0|Too much hype... The book tells you do this do that you will be rich, happy go lucky.  If you think positive, you attract positive things... It's all good but it fails drastically to explain why bad things happen to good people...    It is a waste of time and money. Just like many other books, it is a bad attempt to copy the true master's book, the original; Florance Schovel Shinn's writings... Now, that is the book to buy...
B00127RAJY|5.0|The 30-day shred has one of best short workouts around.  The exercises are not difficult, but can be challenging nonetheless.  I'd recommend this for anyone trying to just get started because it seems like Jillian is actually in the room with you as she takes you through the routine.
B001P9KR8U|4.0|This wasn't a bad movie and it wasn't a fantastic movie. Must I say Danny Boyle did do a fantastic job though directing and the acting was great too. The story was alright (interesting), slow at times but you really stay into the movie. The only real problem i had was with the subtitles and how they were placed. I couldnt see them clearly at points in the film. Final Verdict: At Least Give It A Rental.
B001NFNFIK|4.0|This went immediately to dvd after the briefest of theatrical releases.  Fear not.  It's not a hash or a mish-mash.  It's a linear detective story that holds the attention nicely.  Based on the James Lee Burke novel, it offers some of the atmospherics that are the hallmark of Burke's art; it also has some Burkean lines thrown in for good measure.  The casting is (finally) excellent, with Tommy Lee Jones as Dave and other stalwarts like John Goodman, Ned Beatty and the wonderful Buddy Guy.  Those who are unfamiliar with the Robicheaux novels may find themselves struggling to catch up, though there are various exposition points which help fill in the blanks.  The film (like the book) includes scenes in which an LSD-doped Dave begins talking to confederate warriors (here, in particular, John Bell Hood).  This translates to 'magic realism' in the book and here the magic is in Levon Helm's performance as Hood.<br /><br />The Burke novels are so richly textured that the film seems somewhat lean, but it is better to attempt to capture some of the novels' atmosphere than to abandon the attempt.  Jonathan Kellerman has called Burke the Faulkner of crime fiction and here we get a hint of what that means.  The old south and the new converge in a haunted tale in which Dave himself, as a child, played a part.<br /><br />The sets are excellent, particularly the brief post-Katrina glimpse of New Orleans.  Dave's house and bait shop are just as we would imagine them.  So too are the dingy bars on the back roads of New Iberia.  We even get a glimpse of Alafair's three-legged raccoon, Tripod.  Four and a half stars for all Burke fans and at least four for everyone else.  Now read the book.  And then read all the other books.
B001FB55MG|5.0|I would like to say that all of Adam Sandler's people make appearances  in this movie including Allen Covert (Grandma's Boy), Rob Schneider (Deuce Bigalow & The Waterboy),  and Nick Swardson (Reno 911 & Grandma's Boy) plus its a Happy/Madison Production so it is for Adults to enjoy especially if your and Adam Sandler fan like i am. Russell Brand (Forgetting Sarah Marshall) also plays one of Adam Sandlers friends in the movie and is hilarious. So if you want a good clean (no language or violence) funny movie with a good message to it then  watch this one with the whole family.
B00005JLWN|3.0|Equilibrium is an SF action thriller originally released in 2002, starring Christian Bale and set in a dystopian vision of the future where humanity lives in enforced peace, strictly controlled and enforced by a drug called prozium. The theory is that 'feelings' are responsible for war, murder and mayhem, and prozium represses these. Anything that inspires feelings, such as art, literature or music, is classified as 'EC-10' and destroyed, and those who create or hoard such items are summarily executed as 'sense-criminals'.    The government's will is enforced by the Clerics, elite warriors who are trained in the art of 'gun kata', a total mastery of firearms in ranged, close-quarters and melee combat. The Clerics are tasked to seek out and destroy EC-10 materials and attempt to bring down the Underground, a rebel organisation dedicated to restoring senses and feeling to humanity. When one of the Clerics is 'turned' by the Underground, his colleague Preston becomes disturbed and starts his own exploration of what it means to be human.    Equilibrium was somewhat dismissed on release for being a bit of a Matrix rip-off, with its focus on martial arts, gunplay and brooding heroes dressed in black (although Christian Bale is a considerably more intense and charismatic performer than Keanu Reeves), although Equilibrium owes a lot more to prior dystopian/utopian visions such as Brave New World and Nineteen Eighty-Four and computers do not play a significant role. Also like The Matrix, Equilibrium's premise and storyline is full of holes and if you think about it for more than a few minutes, the whole thing falls apart.    Luckily, Equilibrium works better on a thematic basis, asking some interesting (if unoriginal) questions about freedom, responsibility and consequences. It is visually arresting, and the story dodges several tedious cliches and features some genuinely interesting twists along its path. The action sequences are relatively few and brief (possibly a budgetary decision), but when they do take place they are spectacularly executed. On the acting front Christian Bale, Sean Bean and Emily Watson do some excellent work, but the film suffers from weak antagonists who do not present credible threats when stood up against the murderously efficient Preston . The ending is also bemusing, as the scale of the Underground is revealed to be so vast that it is likely they would have succeeded without Preston's intervention anyway.    Equilibrium (***) is a watchable and solidly enjoyable movie which suffers from some major logic problems, but if you can overlook those, it works quite well. The movie is available now on DVD in the UK and USA.
006135323X|5.0|I was watching an episode of one of my favorite podcasts and they were speaking of this book. The host recommended it and I thought it would be an interesting read. So I picked up a copy and loved it! I would recommend this book to anyone. Tho not perfect and nothing mind blowing, it was nice to understand why stuff actually happens. Im sure anyone reading this book understands that these things do happen but we dont necessarily know WHY these things happen. Dan does a great job of explaining things well with good examples; examples you could happen to you. I lent my copy of the book to two friends so far and I have a couple of people waiting to read it. so go on, read the book! i wanted to read more and this books like this are so interesting that it makes me want to keep reading. good job Dan and hope there is more books coming out from you.
B00002SWEM|5.0|This is one of the best music documentaries ever made. If you love Cuban music this film is a must-have. And if you're not into documentaries, buy the CD, by all means. Some of the best music you will ever hear!
067003830X|5.0|Much of the book has been well summed up by the other reviews, but let me put it quite simply; Anyone reading this book who really grasps the fundamental message here will be VERY motivated to immediately figuring out ways to creatively engage their brain in mapping out their future life....for love, for career, for just about anything we can think of...literally. Moreover, the powerful tendency to fall into personal ruts in our lives now becomes, by implication, a sort of hardwired pathway to the degenerative and dehabilitating brain effects of old age. I sincerely believe we can counter that, and I, for one, am not waiting another minute. Neurobics, here we come :)
B001K3JF7K|5.0|I climbed aboard the Diana Krall bandwagon somewhere around  Look of Love which is a stunning album - so I am not \\"that up\\"  on the \\"earlier\\" Krall vocal style that reviewers here are  lamenting for a return to. I just purchased Quiet Nights and  after one listen I am blown away by it. The classic songs never  get old and always move me and the arrangements are highly  creative. I would buy anything orchestrated by the genius Claus  Ogerman anyway ... so as far as his stamp on this album is concerned,  that makes it a winner. Now getting down to commenting on the  vocal style employed by Diana on this record ... I find it  brilliant, intimate and emotionally evocative. It seems like she  is taking the minimalist road which to me is the mark of a musical  genius ...ie Miles Davis. Her phrasing is brilliant in the mold  of the greatest singer of all time (in my opinion) ... Frank Sinatra.   So ... Im not sure what these reviewers are hearing but I think  this CD is a masterpeice of gorgeous understatement and simplicity. It  is heads above the steady torrent of crap being churned out by the  current music biz machine.

B001W3R494|1.0|I am already rather familiar with the Symphony 11 of Shostakovich.  I downloaded the entire MP3 file, and I can state definitely that this music purporting to be Shostakovich Symphony No. 11 is not written by Shostakovich, but by someone much more modern, possibly American, esp. as the 3rd track is for soprano and orchestra and sung in English. (The first track is essentially a piano concerto.) I am more interested in finding out who wrote this music as opposed to getting my money refunded. After an initial shock I kind of like it. But, as I said, who wrote this?  .

B000VBJEEG|3.0|Ratatouille was cute and funny. Remy, the lead character is a rat who struggles with the choice between being his true self in a world of humans, and being with all his family and loved ones. With humans, Remy can cook and produce food, but has few real relationships. He and the human Linguini share a common love of food, but their cross-species friendship is often strained by misunderstanding. With his fellow rats, Remy has a community and the respect of his peers, but is forbidden from his passion. Eventually, Remy is able to reconcile his two worlds with a charming message of friendhip, loyalty, and love.    The writers deserve props for Collette - a female character that is tough as nails while maintaining her humanity. She is likeable and relatable, without being at all weak. Instead, she is sympathetic because her compassion comes from a place of strength.     Another great aspect to this movie is the atmosphere. The Parisian scenery brings to life a city of passion and love. The animators did a great job. This is a new style of CG. The artwork has such heart to it, that I almost forgot it wasn't water colour animated.    Despite all these good things, the film still falls short. It is difficult to suspend disbelief about talking animals when they interact with talking humans. The mix of rat and human storylines also limits the character development opportunities. In the human world, we enjoy following Linguini's career and romantic aspirations and, in the rat world, we grow to care about Remy's journy, but there isn't enough screen time to get any depth in either storyline.     The other big flaw, which will only annoy pedantic animal lovers like myself, is in the very premise of the movie. Rats actually have an excellent sense of smell. And while, in urban settings, they get dirty out of necessity, they are very picky about what they eat. This is the big flaw which keeps the movie from being a keeper. As much as I kept telling myself it was fantasy, I kept getting distracted by the lack of realism.
B001R7IHA0|5.0|I have listened to this CD over and over again since I got it.  I highly recommend it.   It does have more of a pop feel than his last album.  I suspect it will crossover and do well on the pop charts.
B001PPLIEQ|4.0|First off, let me say that with time, and changes in taste, the Bond movies I liked when I was younger are almost unwatchable.  Even one of the highest grossing Bond films, Die Another Day, wasn't that good.  The reason: Everything I used to like about Bond when I was a teenager/young adult.  The gadgets (invisible car, laser watches, \\"Q\\", space stations), the sexual ennuendos.  Listening to the lounge lizard routine now makes even Pierce Brosnan seem lame.  In short, I never really liked Bond movies as they always seemed a bit cheesy.  I guess it's kinda like 80's glam rock.  It might've been cool then, but this is a different world with higher expectations.<br /><br />Now, with Casino Royale and QoS, we have a believable Bond.  One that is not perfect.  One that has more than one \\"look\\", who never has all the answers.  I realize that this takes away what makes Bond Bond, but that's where the problem is.  There is a group of people who liked the old Bond movies, even those with Sean Connery and those that thought they were lame characters in unbelievably stupid situations.  Seriously, how many individuals think that, without an army, they can take over and maintain rule over the entire world?  Or better yet, try and milk countries for money?  How about killing off the main character with a hat or a laser?<br /><br />With QoS, we have a subtle Bond, one still conflicted over what happened to his love interest from the last movie ( a first, I believe for Bond movies).  I thought the story was very engaging.  A movie where the tech takes a backseat to plot.  It is a more complex plot than what you may be used to, but that's a good thing.  The opening car scene, the knife/scissor fight in the hotel, to name a few, and especially, the scene where he is facing the possibility that he will have to do the unthinkable to avoid a horrible fate (hint:  not this way).  I still get chills.<br /><br />I believe the director is trying to flesh out Bond so that the incarnations we're used to seeing are explained.  The fact that he didn't always make it when he was jumping from structure to structure is a basic example.  And this is the first time he slept with a woman, not to pump her for information, but just because he wanted to.<br /><br />I honestly liked the character development mixed in with my action scenes.  It may not be perfect, but I think the director and the Brocoli family are trying to do it right for once.  Give us motivation behind actions as well as some cool action scenes.  From what I rememeber, this had more fast paced action than CS.  I'm waiting for Bond 23 and looking forward to James moving on, focusing on his career and perfecting his free running skills.<br /><br />To the reader, this movie is a polarizer, you'll either like the direction it's taking or you won't.  Either way, you should watch the movie.<br /><br />By the way, my home theater is only a year old.  I had no problems with the sound field or picture.xplained.

B001FSDOZO|5.0|I had to add a review on this latest Nickelback CD \\"Dark Horse\\".  I purchased it the 1st week it came out and well I didn't think of leaving a review but now I will mostly because of a review \\"Five5x\\" left.  Well I commented to him and now I want all that are thinking of buying this CD to listen to what he doesn't know.  FIRST off this CD is great and it is \\"SOLID And SIMPLY...NICKELBACK!\\" It's on the same wave length as their last great CD \\"All The Right Reasons\\".  Every track is impressive.  As a teenager from the 80's and being a major Def Leppard fan, when I saw Mutt Lang being involved in the project I knew it would be an impressive CD.  There was NO doubt to me I would purchase it and I awaited the premier date with enthusiasm.  I knew what Mutt Lang is about... He's A PERFECTIONIST.  I hear little signs of Mutt in it as a lot reviewers have stated.  Is that a good thing Mutt being part of this?  Yes I say only because again Mutt is a perfectionist.  The songs, \\"Something In Your Mouth\\" and \\"Burn It To The Ground\\" are my personal favorites.  \\"Gotta Be Somebody\\" is the 1st track released from the CD, and I think that was a good choice.. It's a great radio song.  The 2 ballads \\"I'd Come For You\\" and \\"Never Gonna Be Alone\\" are I think their best ballads they've recorded to this point.  At first I wan't sure of the track \\"Just To Get High\\" mainly because of the title, but I listened to the lyrics and found their message is anti-drugs and the music compliments it nicely.  Overall the CD I think hits on all cylinders and is a perfect back-up to their last CD \\"All The Right Reasons\\".

B001FBSMF8|5.0|This album is full of musiquality and energy. It wouldn't be fair to still expect Soundgarden sounds from Chris Cornell and rate this album as \\"1 star\\". When listening to this album, you can still hear Cornell's incredible rock background and strong musical foundation. All the songs make a very strong sensation in my heart. I really haven't enjoyed an album this much for a long time. Most people would think that \\"this is a Timbaland factory production\\" but it is Chris Cornell's music and lyrics with a very nice touch from Timbaland. And who can really deny that Timbaland does a very good job in music industry? This is nothing like a Timberlake song or a standard hip-hop. This is really something else. If you are expecting very hard core music like Soundgarden or Audislave, this may not be for you. But this is still Cornell's rock background, with a very energetic touch on it. And when I listen to it, I really feel that Cornell put his heart into it. He wrote all the songs and music... This is great music!
B0010X73ZG|5.0|The Mist is an incredible film. It truly is. You owe it to yourself to purchase this film. The film is about a group of people stuck inside of a grocery store due to a strange mist that is surrounding the environment outside, as far as the eye can see. As it turns out, there are monsters inside of this mist. How will the people escape? Heck, WILL they escape. The movie answers these questions.  This film has some truly creepy moments, as well as epic ones. There is one monster in the film that will make your jaw drop (you'll know it when you see it). The interesting thin about this film is the ending. It's not your steretypical Hollywood (\\"everyone lives happily ever\\") ending. It's quite different.  Most people say that the ending is sad. Personally, I thought this film was incredible except for the ending. However, I disliked this ending for reasons different than most people. Most people disliked it because of what happened specifically to the people involved. I disliked it because I approached this film with the assumption that it was \\"the end of the world\\". Even with that in mind, it is still good and unique.  Purchase this DVD. I can almost promise you'll enjoy the plot, music, ans characters (some you love and some you love to hate). One way or another, after watching the final 9 minutes and 27 seconds, you'll walk away glad that you had this experience.
0694524441|4.0|I enjoyed listening to the voice of Jeremy Irons very much, and then this wonderful book he is reading makes it double bliss.  The only comment i have is that is does not go on longer, i could listen all day to him!  The book the Alchemist is one i never got round to reading, and now have listened to it to and from work, in the car. It is a wonderful book full of interesting views and philosofies. the descriptive quality is good, so you can see in your minds eye the scenery unfolding.  I hope you will enjoy it as much as I have
1416914307|5.0|CITY OF GLASS is the third novel in The Mortal Instruments trilogy and you will not be disappointed in this final installment by Cassandra Clare. In fact, you will be taken on the roller coaster adventure of your literary experience.<br /><br />Buckle yourself in for your ride as you begin City of Glass. It commences several days after The CITY OF ASHES ends. Clary and her family (brother Jace) and friends (the Lightwoods) must travel to the city of Alicante, the ancesteral home of all Shadow hunters. Clary's focus on going to Alicante is to find the person that can \\"help\\" her mother awaken from her coma like state, a fact that is supplied by her mother's friend Madeline. The problem with this scenario is that Jace believes that Idris, the beautiful city of glass, is too dangerous a place for Clary and will stop at nothing to keep her from going, even if that means that he has to lie to her and needs to enlist in Simon's help to achieve it. What happens next will leave you white knuckling your book and breathless and you take your first plunge, and just think your ride has only begun.<br /><br />Clary soon realizes that she has been lied to and left behind and when no one will help her, she decides to use her special powers to enter into the city because she refuses to be a bystander. This action makes her an outlaw in Alicante for you CANNOT enter the city of Idris without permission, thus she ends up in a situation that nearly kills her. Luckily she has Luke to help her, but remember that he is a down worlder and his presence in Alicante is not good news....can you feel the bumpiness of the ride ahead? I know I felt some chills of dread.<br /><br />When Clary is finally within the city walls of Idris and in company of Jace and the others, it is to find the city under much duress and weary over the impending threat of Valentine's wrath. This sickening doom cause Jace and Clary to investigate a \\"vision\\" and spend time together, moments that only seems to cause more heartache and confusion to an already forbidden relationship. Not to mention that a new character draws Clary to him and his presence will forever change how Clary feels about Jace. These moments are the G-force emotions that leave your heart in your stomach and screaming AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!! as you travel the loops this gigacoaster of an amazing story offers you.<br /><br />Jace's story is such a driving force in this book, his character devlopment makes your heart ache for him. His inner struggle, the reason for so many of his actions are brought to light and it is so well presented that you are brought to tears.<br /><br />The other twists and turns of this book ride are of the other characters in this series that have seemed to come forth and shine, such as the case with Simon. We have seen him develop from the awkward, love lorn geek to a confident, insightful and amazingly attractive blood sucker and we love him all the more for it. Any time that Simon is on the page you are drawn towards him and want more of him, as do others :). Magnus is always a welcome presence and you will not be disappointed as he manages to make his flashy, wise self important in helping Clary. Alec also grows into the shadow hunter that he was born to be and finally faces up to his fears (sigh). I adore the fact that the character story arcs were well tended to and you are left contented and happy with their resolutions.<br /><br />The final confrontation had me twisting, nail biting, screaming and absolutely riveted to every single word. It took many stories, words and moments to get to this battle of good and evil, Nephelim and downworlder and the final moments were sheer genius.<br /><br />As I read the last page of this much anticipated novel and realised that my ride was over I was left with a myriad of emotions whirling throughout my brain. I was so pleased that the story arc was so beautifully tied up without being gratuitously violent or having an \\"out of left field\\" resolutionthat I could truly appreciate the pulse pounding, breath taking finale that was created since City of Bones began and say that it was my favorite read of the series.<br /><br />I have to say BRAVO, BRAVISSIMA to Cassandra Clare for creating a story so exciting that it grips you and locks you for the ride of your life, from the first page to the last and never lets you go. I don't think that my praise can ever give it the due justice that it deserves. City of Glass is beautifully written and interwoven with amazingly unforgettable characters and moments, everything is brought full circle and I have to say that I want to get back on the ride and do it all over again and again.<br /><br />[...]<br />The Ravenous Readertaking finale that was created since City of Bones began and say that it was my favorite read of the series.

B000WCBPOG|5.0|First of all I would just like to say I am a big Beatles fan and after watching the movie: Across the Universe, I had to get the soundtrack because the songs are done so well.<br /><br />Anyways, regarding the product and how it was shipped... I got the package within the time range amazon predicted and I got the item in the condition as was stated: new. There was nothing wrong with the product and absolutely nothing went wrong with shipping. Great job, keep up the good work.

B001R7IHA0|5.0|Amazing describes both the artist & the CD.  Love \\"Till Summer\\" and can't get the rest of the songs out of my head either.  I can enjoy & appreciate every song on the CD.  Some critics don't seem to like (or understand) the CD but from a fan's standpoint, it is Keith Urban at his best.  You can hear the emotion of each song through his voice or the instrument he is playing.  The man is a genius at music.  He puts together a song that may appear to be simple, but you know the process to get there was definately not.
0545128285|4.0|When I read reviews, I like to dive right in to the low-rated ones.  I'm more interested to know why people dislike something more than why they love it.  I more or less evaluate whether their negative comments carry any merit.  Some of the repeated complaints about this book are:<br /><br />1.  It's not suitable for young children.  No one ever said it was for young children.  In my personal opinion, most of the Harry Potter series is not suitable for young children, despite the 9-12 age group rating.  Maybe the first 2, but pretty much with Prisoner of Azkaban and beyond, the material is too dark and mature.  Parental supervision required.  Furthermore, there are also legions of people out there who protest the violence and darkness of Grimm's Fairy Tales, yet they are traditionally read to children.  Proceed at your own risk.<br /><br />2.  Not up to \\"Rowling standards\\".  Are you totally missing the part about this book never being intended for the masses?  She didn't write it for you, critics!<br /><br />3.  It's too short.  Again, it was just a small project not aimed at publication.  Besides, fairy tales/fables work best when they are short and sweet.<br /><br />I am happy to have purchased this book and I enjoyed reading it.  The stories bear similarities to the fairy tales we all know, but that's a good thing.  One more reason to believe that if there really is a wizarding world hidden from us, its inhabitants, though magical, are not so very different from you and I.  Hooray for any chance to escape into a little imaginative fantasy world for a while, given the state of the real one we contend with today.
B000053W01|5.0|This is a double-disc remastered set, full of all 'The Carpenters' biggest charting hits. It even contains 'The Rainbow Connection' from 'The Muppet Movie' with added auditory. I mainly bought this collection for 'They Long To Be (Close To You)' and got even more than what I bargained for. I wasn't alive when 'The Carpenters' graced the music scene, but i can still appreciate this great music. I first heard of 'The Carpenters' by shuffling through my aunt's music collection at a very young age and stumbled upon this great band. To be honest i'm not too sure what the hits are in this collection, but each and every one of these tracks goes down as one in my book. Not only a music lover but I have a weakness for ballads with charming melodies. Karen takes it away with ballads like 'I Just Fall In Love Again' 'Tryin' To Get The Feeling Again' 'Rainy Days & Mondays' & 'Yesterday Once More' along with other amazing songs that aren't ballads. If you don't have any material from 'The Carpenters' right here is a fine place to start, you wont be disappointed. What are you waiting for? Order your copy right now!
0553807048|4.0|I too knew shorty er I mean jordy (as he was known then) back from the old Bay Terrace days. I grew up in the building next door to his. I did enjoy both books, but found this better as it described better how he got into this whole scam much better the first book. I did hate hearing about his wife worship, she seems like a money grubbing whore to me. Not someone to worship. His first wife was very cool. Like the rest of his life he screwed that up too. I hated his overuse of the word \\"Alas\\"! Lots of phrases like that were over used and distracted me from an interesting story.   One of the reasons I liked  this better than the first book was it showed how he went from selling ices at Jones beach and then seemingly the next day he was pulling up to the PS 169 back hoops court in his porsche.   BTY even back then he was a cocky kid who thought he was a much better player than he was. Andy Greene (wigwam) and Lipsky (his best friend) were both considered cooler, better looking and far better athletes growing up. Funny how that turned around with Little Napeleon-Jordy.   Overall I enjoyed this book. I just dont know if I would have enjoyed it as much had I not known so many of characters portrayed so well.     Last note: based on Shorty err I mean Jordy's dateline interview, he still does not seem to get it. He is living in a condo on Californian beach and acting like he got a raw deal. You hurt a lot of people dude.

B001DDBCUK|2.0|I enjoyed the \\"Sex and the City\\" series, which chronicled the lives of four successful single women in New York City. The series ended its 7 season run gracefully, with the characters evolving from (mostly) 30-something, slightly self-absorbed singles to mature women embracing mature relationships and, in some cases, motherhood.<br /><br />The most frustating thing about the \\"Sex and the City\\" movie is that, although five years have gone by, these characters do not seem to have evolved at all. If anything, they seem to have backslid into the same immature cycles that they were in during the series. Once again, Carrie is jilted by committment-phobe Mr. Big, then takes him back. Once again, Miranda harshly rejects Steve after he makes a mistake, then takes him back. Once again, Samantha realizes that she's just not the type of person meant for a traditional, monogamous relationship. The only character who seems to have really grown up is Charlotte, who is flourishing in a strong marriage and as a mother. But her character is given little to do, other than comfort the other three women as they continue wallowing in self-inflicted misery.<br /><br />On a superficial note, fashion was always a big part of the \\"Sex and the City\\" series, and the clothes always towed the line between stylish and over-the-top. But the outfits in this movie are hideous ... hardly a scene passed by where I didn't find myself thinking \\"What the hell ...?\\"<br /><br />Although it was nice to see the actresses and characters reunited, let's hope the sequel has a better script, and that these characters are given the chance to grow and evolve. The actresses, and the audience, deserve it.
B00079FUI6|5.0|Prior to purchasing the first four seasons of Desperate Housewives I had never watched any of the episodes on TV. By the commercials I had seen though I had a feeling it would be something I'd like. Recently I've taken the time to watch all four seasons and I'm chomping at the bit now waiting for Season five. I don't know how I'll make it all the way to September!!!<br /><br />This show is different than most, at least to me. I thought it was going to be more of a \\"Soap Opera\\" type but it's more of a drama with comic undertones. It'll make you laugh mostly, make you cry sometimes and make you sit there with your mouth hanging open thinking \\"I can't believe she did that!\\".<br /><br />I find this series thoroughly enjoyable and addictive!!
0802798225|5.0|Sigh. I'm in love with yet another fictional male character: Alejandro Fuentes. As a Mexicano gang member with a desire to make something more of himself, he's your typical bad boy trapped in a life he doesn't want. Enter Brittany Ellis: head cheerleader with a seemingly perfect life, who ends up falling for Alex against her better judgement.    Could I put this book down? Even for five minutes? No, I could not.    I'm a sucker for epic, forbidden love stories, so it's no surprise that I loved Perfect Chemistry. It's like a modern Romeo & Juliet, only with gangs and high school. Simone Elkeles has a brilliant writing style that hooked me from the first page, and there's no way for me to describe it other than compelling and addictive.    I love Alex and Brittany, and I seriously didn't want the book to end. I even liked the epilogue which was a bit cheesy, yes, but oh so satisfying. The classic love story is one we've all seen before: two people from different worlds meet, and, against all odds, fall madly in love with each other. Elkeles has mixed this one up a bit, and has added depth and intrigue to her characters, making them both immensely likeable and realistic.    Perfect Chemistry touches upon some important messages and themes, including race, disability, and acceptance. Each character confronts their imperfections, learns what it means to be in love, and how to deal with the consequences and sacrifices that inevitably accompany it.    I can't think of anything else to say here, as I've still got that 'wow' feeling you get after reading a great book. If you're a fan of the romance genre, I highly recommend you get yourself a copy of this. You won't be disappointed!

0525421033|5.0|I have a feeling that If I Stay may be one of those books that sells millions of copies, wins numerous awards, and inspires people to pick up a pen and tell a story of their own.    It starts off with a lighthearted chapter that showcases the close relationship Mia shares with her Mum, Dad and younger brother Teddy. I instantly fell in love with these four characters, as they reminded me very much of my own parents and sister: happy, fun, and more like friends than family. However, by page eleven, the tone of the book shifts, and everything has changed.    Mia is left staring at her broken body, while her family lie sprawled around her. She finds herself in a kind of limbo, a limbo where she can see, hear and touch, but can't feel anything. From here she must make the difficult decision of staying on Earth and living, or dying and hopefully seeing her family again. This has to be one of the most difficult decisions anyone could ever be faced with, and I applaud Gayle Forman for writing about it so eloquently and vividly.    I loved how the past was interweaved with the present, as this allowed us to get a glimpse into Mia's life before the accident, and to really get to know her. Mia is a strong and appealing character, and one which I think a lot of people will identify with. I also have to mention Adam, Mia's boyfriend. He's caring, thoughtful and the kind of person that we should all get to meet at some point or another. In fact, I think he might be my favourite part of the whole book.    'Just Listen', Adam says with a voice that sounds like shrapnel.    The above sentence is one of my favourites. To imagine that anyone's voice could sound like shrapnel has to be one of the most effective ways to describe someone dealing with unimaginable grief and fear. If that doesn't make you want to read more, I don't know what will.    If I Stay is moving, touching and beautifully written. It's so gripping that you have to read all two hundred and seven pages in one go, andis sure to be one of the year's most talked about releases. With brilliant characters that easily come to life, as well as a story so memorable and meaningful, I'd say that Gayle Forman is well on her way to Alice Sebold-like superstardom.
0316067601|1.0|Marcus Luttrell may be many things - a hero, a patriot, a proud Texan, but he is not a good writer.  This is a book I simply could not finish.  It was poorly written and Luttrell's diatribe against those he perceives to be leftists or liberals was tiring.
B001R7IHA0|5.0|Maybe I'm biased but I just don't think that Keith Urban knows how to make a bad album.<br /><br />Defying Gravity sets itself apart from his previous work in that it has the obvious theme in that it is clearly one long love letter to his wife, but it's upbeat and affectionate tone also carries over to his fans.<br /><br />Defying Gravity is a joyous celebration of love and desire that resonates in a simutaneous message of Hope & positivity. Having come thru a particularly dismal winter, this CD has really hit the spot! I think of it as induced Spring-Fever and will probably have my first copy worn out within a month.
B001LF4IA6|5.0|Well, what can we say about Bruce Springsteen, is one of the best artist in rock and roll history. Working on a dream album, from my particular point of view is a piece of art, all the material is very good, maybe some Springsteen fans believe that the material is a quier of lite, and maybe they're right, but the work in every single sound is majestic, I really enjoy listening the album since the first time I play it, like all the disc, I have my favorites songs, for example Outlaw Pete, My Lucky Days, Working on a dream, This Life, Surprise Surprise, The Wrestler, Kingdom of days, are my favorites ones; I recommend that you have to sit and listen the album complete, is a very professional work, of course we are talking about Bruce Springsteen. Buy the album you will enjoy it
B001P9KR8U|3.0|From what I have seen of most Oscar winning movies, this is a typical letdown;      I rented this a couple of days ago and watched the movie for the first time.  I gave the movie three stars because the cinematography (the visual) and the soundtrack are excellent.  As I said however in my review title this type of movie has such a predictable outcome that it lacks suspense.  Because of the flashbacks you know everything will turn out for Jamal and why would the game show set be used in the first place if he were not going to win everything?  I do think Jamal's adult character does a good job of acting as someone suffering post-traumatic stress as he is forced to relive his life while answering the questions but beyond that the acting is average.  Again, the acting is rescued by spectacular visuals of India, very good juxtaposition between the slums and modern technology and by those cute, adorable children used during the first part of Jamal's life.  Images of cute children will always rescue a mediocre plot.   The story also skips around a lot and has a bizarre speed of slow pace, fast pace- back to slow pace which I found very hard to keep track of.  There were times the movie seemed to be getting interesting, then it would switch back to dull.   Movies that are set in foreign countries tend to do well at the Academy and Slumdog was no exception.  An unfamiliar location and culture adds a certain amount of romanticism to a movie which often will override a mediocre plot as Slumdog Millionaire benefits from the location where it was filmed.   Had this movie been filmed and set in Los Angeles, or anywhere else in America this movie would not have been nominated for the Academy Awards.

B000001ESF|5.0|This is one of the best albums I have ever heard, and proved to me that Rush is without a doubt my FAVORITE band.  Everything about this album is great, but some songs do stand out more than others, but that's okay.<br /><br />2112:  A roughly twenty minute long song that is behind the title of this album and it has some of the best music I have ever heard.  The opening overture is probably Rush's best instrumental piece and always gets me in the mood to rock it out and then we suddenly come to the lyrics with the portion Priests of Syrinx which is also one seriously great piece.  The other pieces are good as well, but the first two parts are just plain brilliance.<br /><br />Other great songs include A Passage to Bangkok and Twilight Zone which also show off the band's ability at executing great instrumentals, but they don't really hold up to the sheer power of the title song.  It's hard to be to follow-up act to a song such as 2112.<br /><br />So, remember, if there is ONE album by Rush you essentially need to own it is going to be 2112.  It doesn't have all their big hits or anything, but the title song alone deserves it as well as the album cover which is still widely used to represent the Band.

B001RTP3Z0|5.0|I swore I would not open this DVD until after seeing L. Cohen in Oakland the Monday after next. But I'm so glad I broke my vow.    This is one of the most wonderful concerts I've ever seen captured on DVD.  The band and Leonard's singers are top-notch, and one senses that they feel as though they are a part of something special.  The songs span nearly 40 years of a canon that is second to none.    Most amazing of all,though, is how a digital disc can cut through its own technology and exude so much warmth and passion.  Even when the camera shows a close shot of Cohen, one can still sense the warmth, love and admiration coming from the ecstatic London audience.    As for Leonard Cohen...if he were to do nothing but sing, that would be enough given the wonderful breadth of material performed at this concert.   However, his gentle and gracious command of the stage provides this show an added depth and dimension.  Within the span of minutes he can be hilarious, self-deprecating, humble, poignant, appreciative...and I could easily go on with the superlatives to describe his on-stage demeanor.    Very often I make a point of remembering to trust the art and not the artist.  In the case of Leonard Cohen, I tend to trust both.  His warmth seems genuine.  Unlike so many of his stature, his humility comes across as real.  His spoken words are every bit as powerful as those that are sung.  Given the way that the barriers are broken down between the singer and the band and the audience...to the point where it feels as though they are all part of one celebratory evening...such humility, graciousness and warmth cannot be anything but genuine.    The highlights are too many to mention:  \\"Suzanne\\" sounds as fresh as it did 40 years ago.   \\"Anthem\\" sounds more urgent today than when it was first penned.  \\"The Future\\" & \\"First We Take Manahattan\\" are even more biting now in the 21st Century than when they were first penned.  Cohen's increased age gives songs such as \\"Boogie Street,\\"\\"Tower of Song,\\" & \\"Democracy\\" a world weariness that makes these songs all the more penetrating.  His lovely \\"If It Be Your Will\\" sounds as much like a prayer as it does one of the loveliest songs ever written.  If I don't stop now, I'll wind up writing accolades about every song on this DVD. Yes, it is that wonderful!    I've been fortunate to see so many of the greats in my lifetime - legends whose works will be remembered for decades to come.  Some have been surly and stand-offish. Others have been appreciative and welcoming toward their audience.      It is refreshing to see the best of everything embodied in this Leonard Cohen concert.  Songs that are amongst the best ever written, still performed with a passion (as well as with the added wisdom that comes from Cohen being 74 years young), with a band & audience & singer all equally committed to one another.      There are moments when I laughed out loud at Leonard's deadpan, wry humor.  There were times when tears welled in my eyes from the sincerity of the words that came out of his mouth, either spoken or in song.      In a day and age where so much seems packaged and perfunctionary, it is refreshing to see & hear someone such as Cohen whose observations can warm the heart or cut like a knife to get to the heart of a matter.  He is the real deal.  No airs, no faux modesty...just a man with four decades' worth of majestic material, with an excellent band whose respect for Cohen is reciprocated by their singer with his respect for their talents & abilities, along with a genuine warmth & sense of humanity that allows Leonard Cohen to turn a large London venue into a setting that is as intimate as being in one's living room.      Without a doubt, one of the finest, most moving and most satisfying concert DVDs I've ever seen.      I'm glad that I opened this prior to April 13.  Seeing this makes me look forward to seeing Cohen in a small Oakland theater even more so than I already was.    However, had I not beenfortunate enough to have gotten a ticket for his upcoming concert, I have to say that this DVD would have been a more than fine consolation.   It is worth every cent.  The staging, lighting, musicianship, song selection and sound are painstakingly stellar, obviously  given great care & much thought.      This is a true gem, a most worthy representation of one of the greatest songwriters of our time.
0307269752|5.0|When I started this book, I almost put it down in the first few pages. It was so slow and boring. I kept at it and once it took off, I couldn't put it down. I actually listened to this book on my iPod which I generally reserve for passing the time in the car. \\"The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo\\" was so good that I found myself walking around the house listening to it. I had to know what happened. This is the best mystery I've read since Val McDermid -- and interestingly enough the main character is reading a Val McDermid in this book.<br /><br />The two main characters are introduced in what appears to be separate story lines which finally come together about half way through the book. Lisbeth Salander is so odd and quirky that at first she's hard to like. I think that's the point. In the story, the other characters react to her in much the same way that I did, but I quickly developed an empathy for her. We learn quite a bit about her inner self but her background -- how she got this way -- remains a mystery even at the end of the book. What we do learn is that she is an expert hacker, has a photographic memory and her own distinct sense of justice. In spite of how she comes across, she is anything but helpless.<br /><br />The other main character is Mikhail Blomqvist, a journalist, and I wasn't sure I liked him either at first. I came to respect his dogged determination and clear sense of right and wrong.<br /><br />The story line that brings these two very different characters together is complex and fascinating and involves the investigation of a girl who disappeared more than 30 years ago. What Blomqvist and Salander find is quite unexpected. I can't say enough about how well-written this story is. Sometimes books I've enjoyed reading don't hold up when I listen to them being read, but this one did. If you like this one, be sure to read the sequel, \\"The Girl Who Played with Fire.\\"

B000MM1F5A|3.0|I'm a fado traditionalist; this art form is best enjoyed in small intimate settings, accompanied by Portuguese and Spanish guitars. The live concert CD is OK, but it's big, orchestral fado, and not what I was expecting.<br /><br />However, the documentary on the accompanying DVD is spellbinding. It's a wonderful history of fado, punctuated with performances by Mariza and others, mostly in small, intimate taverna settings.<br /><br />If I could split my rating for this product, I would give the CD 2 stars, and the DVD 5 stars.
B001K3JF7K|2.0|When I saw the track list, I was excited, then I listened and found myself actually skipping forward and not finishing at least 4 of the tracks.  I hadn't done that since her disastrous \\"Girl in the Other Room.\\"  There's so much that could potentially have been done and so much gone wrong.  It's not that Diana can't do a good job of the breathless singing, it's just that this CD is saturated with it!  The first two numbers are fine, then it starts to get maddeningly repetitious.  Also, it takes until Track 8 \\"So Nice\\" that she finally does something a little up tempo.  I also recognized the Ogerman orchestration from Look of Love, but here it's so bland and lamely attempts to digress into \\"alternate\\" chord progressions, but it sounds like the orchestra simply is lost.  Ogerman seems to think that all romance music is made up of entirely minors and diminished sevenths.  Gets extremely boring.  The \\"Boy from Ipanema\\" sounded like no one in the room had ever played it nor heard it before, let alone not having an authentic bossa nova feel.  \\"Walk on By\\" is missing the KEY hook - the 11-note downward piano bass walk at the chorus.  And SHE's the piano player!  I really thought Diana was going back to what worked which was: sometimes sassy, sometimes sultry, sometimes playful versions of great classic tunes.  Sorry to say this just was a total disappointment.
B00005JPKE|5.0|I guess my response to this excellent war movie is well enough covered by reviewer, 'Darth Rad'. Eastwood is to be commended for the innovative tactic of shooting both sides of the war simultaneously and bringing an even-handed weighting to both. The drive of the narrative is not the epic, grand heroics of so much war stuff. These are given ample footage while the lives, up close and personal, of various levels of the Japanese military machine, are tended with gracious detail. This is a very moving account. Mistakenly, I thought I was watching the Eastwood when initially looking at similarily titled, Iwo Jima, 36 days in Hell. Suffice to say that for all its archival truths, it doesn't bear up to Eastwood's flick. If this war film takes your fancy you might look for 'The Bridge', or some of the Russian, Sukurov's films.
B0019CSXAM|5.0|The best show on TV really found its groove in season 3.  There were fewer great episodes than in the first two seasons, but EVERY episode was good.  The special features alone are worth buying the dvd, trust me.
B001PPLIFU|3.0|They cut out too many scenes to explain wtf was going on.  they just cut and jump.  Then, somehow bond becomes superman and breaks off a steel door handle.  COME ON.  The director was horrible, bad angles, etc.    Casino Royale was amazing.  This was just stuff blowing up with ZERO story.      It got better later into the movie, that's the only reason why I give it 3 stars.  I still like Daniel Craig as Bond - but I think the writer was horrible (the script is probably 20 pages long) and the director sucked - making the movie okay, at best.
B000IFQLLY|5.0|The Best of Depeche Mode, Vol. 1 being Depeche Mode's 5th compilation album and their 2006 release contains many gems. Amongst these being \\"shake the disease\\", \\"precious\\", \\"dream on\\" and many many more. They also a new song for the time, i.e., \\"Martyr\\". We get very well-written liner notes by Paul Morley. Anton Corbijn is an amazing photographer. The rose on the front I have no idea what it is supposed to represent. 5/5.

B000002UWL|5.0|Behavior being Pet Shop Boys 5th album and 4th of entirely new music and contained such hits as \\"Being Boring\\", \\"So Hard\\", \\"How Can You Expect to Be Taken Seriously?\\"  and \\"Jealousy\\". The album does sound a bit like Violator by Depeche Mode and Tennant himself has made remarks that this was actually the case. The lyrics are very introspective and thoughtfull. 5/5.
B000P12LWY|3.0|The more I watched The Tudors and Jonathan Meyers, the more I thought of Elvis Presley.  He pouted his way through this role for which IMHO he was so misscast. I kept waiting for him to start singing Blue Suede Shoes. He's too short, too dark (hair) and does not have the physical stature of Henry VIII. I think a better choice for Henry VIII would have been Steven Waddington, the actor portraying the Duke of Buckingham.    When this series was first aired I didn't have Showtime.  But as luck would have it I was rewarded a free year of Showtime by my satellite provider.  I had already missed a few episodes when the re-runs began and decided to buy both season one and two and finally see what I was missing.    The costumes were sumptuous and the scenery gorgeous; I could almost feel the warmth coming from the huge fireplaces.  Except for Myers, I think the other characters were very well cast.  They could have featured Henry Czerny much more, as he is a fine actor.      Many history buffs have noted the historical errors, so I won't go there.  But when one of the characters in season two, I believe, responded with \\"Okay\\",  I was dumbfounded.  I had the closed caption feature on and there it was in front of my eyes.      All in all, ignoring the steamy sex scenes, all the footage of people riding horses over hill and dale and the pouting of an Elvis look-alike, it was rather enjoyable due to Natalie Dormer, Sam Neil, Jeremy Northam, Peter O'Toole, and a cast of unknown hundreds.  (Why did most of the young men at court have to look alike.  It was really hard to keep track of who was who.)    I also have to agree with the poster who mentioned how user unfriendly the menu of the disk is.  Also, the type used in the description of the episodes is so small as to be unreadable.  And it would not allow a \\"zoom\\" at that point.
B0009OAUSY|4.0|Very being The Pet Shop Boys 1993 release and their 7 album, 5th of previously-unreleased music and contained hits such as  \\"Can you forgive her?\\" , \\"I wouldn't normally do this kind of thing\\", \\"Liberation\\", \\"Yesterday, When I Was Mad\\" and \\"Go West\\". The cd booklet contains no lyrics and the artwork is very avantgarde in a strange way. We do get a list with additional musicians and vocalists. 4/5.
B000NA2BEU|4.0|Arrived when promised, in good condition. Fun to see how series ended, although bonus disc featured the Season 4 network pitch, now wish they REALLY hadn't cancelled the show.
0385340990|5.0|Very interesting and entertaining book.  I already knew a little about Guernsey Island.  That is one of the things that attracted me to the book.  The history lessons about World War II that I learned in the book were of real interest to me.  The way the book was written was fun and easy to read.
B001R7IHA0|5.0|Another solid offering from KU. Look for several number one's from this album; Maybe album of the year. Its a keeper.
B00133KFGW|5.0|This movie has been clearly depicted on here by quite a few people so I will not take the time to go through every aspect of the plot.  In general the movie is creative, the music really adds to the plot line, and the music itself is quite solid.  In fact I also went back and purchased the soundtrack, something I do not do often.<br /><br />For music lovers this movie is perfect.  It really can touch us on a deeply emotional level and gives us a new aspect at which to look or better yet where to listen for music.  Sometimes it can happen in the most unusual circumstances.<br /><br />Overall this movie was fantastic.  The acting was great, the plot was fantastic, and the music did not let you down one bit.  If you are a bit of a rut this movie can definitely lift your spirits.
B001F7XIJW|5.0|THIS IS REAL MUSIC. MUSIC THAT SOUNDS LIKE MUSIC, NOT JUST A COUPLE GIUTARS, A DRUMMER, AND A LOUSEY SINGER. THESE GUYS CAN PLAY.

GOJIRA IS HARD, FAST, AND BEAUTIFUL ALL AT THE SAME TIME. BUY THIS ALBUM, IT'S THE BEST REALESE OF 2008.
B001XRLWPQ|5.0|I'll freely admit that the reason I watched the premiere of Castle (and every episode since) is because Nathan \\"Captain Mal\\" Fillion is in it. Love the man. LOOOOVE him. He was pitch perfect as the futuristic dashing spaceship captain, a hoot in Dr. Horrible's, and he's got an incredible comedic ability blended with good acting chops and toothsome looks. He's great.<br /><br />So, finally, we see him get top dog billing on a prime time show on one of networks. He's Rick Castle, a bestselling author who is drawn into a partnership (of sorts) with police detective Kate Beckett played by Stana Katic when murders by a serial killer are based on Castle's novels. She's the reluctant partner, he's having a grand old time (with lots of humor), needling her while also being insightful and helpful due to his myriad connections. (I do enjoy how, as the show progresses, we see how he puts that celebrity of his to good use.) That's the core of the show, the conflict and chemistry between the cop and the writer.<br /><br />It works because of Fillion's immense personal charm, humor, and snap-crackliness. Stana is fine in her semi-tense, driven, cop-girl who doesn't eat enough way, but the show is Nathan's.<br /><br />It was nice to see Susan Sullivan of Dharma and Greg fame again, this time as flamboyant mom--oh, those bright outfits, that hair--to Castle. She's good in anything, frankly. We also have a cute if way, way, way too sweet-and-nice daughter to Castle. (Pulease, I haven't met a teen this squeaky nice since Sunday School decades ago. Given grandma's dramatics and dad's wicked sense of humor, where did she come from?)The scenes of daughter and dad tend to be really squishily heartwarming, and that's okay with me. Sometimes, I need that sentimental dose.<br /><br />The supporting cop cast adds to the fun--watch them enjoy their espresso in the episode where Castle springs for one for the crew.<br /><br />Whether Katic will be able to keep up is my main worry. She is doing okay, and there are moments when you're glad she's the crankier one, \\"straight man.\\" But this show will rise or fall on not just Fillion's talent and charisma--and yes, hottienss--but on whether she can really ramp it up and keep the core hot.<br /><br />If you like a less serious cop show, and you are a fan of Fillion's, you've gotta watch/get CASTLE.e glad she's the crankier one, \\"straight man.\\" But this show will rise or fall on not just Fillion's talent and charisma--and yes, hottienss--but on whether she can really ramp it up and keep the core hot.

B000GPIPVU|1.0|In the days before digital downloads I might almost say the album is worth it for the song \\"Three More Days.\\" A great tune with a strong resembalance to Dave Mason's \\"Feeling Alright\\" -- its got a good R&B back beat, old school organ, and a Memphis style horn section (that blends into the song perfectly -- unlike the overpowering mixes all too common since the early 70's). It all perfectly supports Ray's mellowed out Joe Cocker voice. Definitely a song worth listening to.    As for the rest of the album? It completely disappointed me. Partly my fault -- I really liked \\"Trouble\\" and was expecting something along those lines. Mellow, yes, but not actually hard to hear. Ray almost whispers much of this albumn (a waste of his vocal talents) and strings or a gently strummed guitar drive too many songs. The result is a guy that is capable of creating a powerful album was prevented from doing so. Some songs are simply dull (\\"Can I Stay\\") and others feel like they might be great live but were a missed opportunity in the studio(\\"You Can bring Me Flowers\\").     If you are a Ray fan, then of course get this. If you are just checking him out, get Trouble instead. And if you really like Trouble and are hoping to get a second helping, this won't cut it.
B00003CXUM|5.0|There are few films that can match internal beauty with visual splendor quite like Wong Kar-Wai marvelous `Fa Yeung Nin Wa'; a film that is intoxicatingly rich in character development as it is in the vast array of color splashed across each of Maggie Cheung delicately designed garments.<br /><br />The film tells of Mr. Chow and Mrs. Chan, two neighboring tenants in an apartment building in Hong Kong, circa 1962.  Though they only meet and or converse in passing they soon uncover that they have a terrible reality in common; their spouses are engaged in an affair.  Determined not to fall into the same trap of infidelity, they form a close platonic bond with one another, frequenting the same restaurants and spending a lot of time talking and confiding in one another.  There is an apparent chemistry, and it becomes obvious that there is a longing for one another, but they remain at a distance so as not to disrespect their own dignity.<br /><br />What we are left with then, is a breathtaking look at restrained affections.<br /><br />I want to just take a minute to talk about director Wong Kar-Wai.  I've made statements before in my reviews of `Chung Hing Sam Lam' and `My Blueberry Nights' that I didn't understand what the draw was to this director, and that my experiences with those two particular films made me question whether I should look into his work anymore.  This film alone is so incredibly good (seriously, one of the top twenty films I've EVER SEEN) that it makes up for any previous concerns and or notions I've had towards this director and compels me to watch everything he's made.  I don't see how he could ever top this (or how any director could really top this) but I am more than willing to give the rest of his films a go.<br /><br />Why, you ask.<br /><br />What Wong Kar-Wai does here is effortless transference of emotional connection.  In other words; he paints such a vividly captivating picture that he evokes in us an immediate reaction, playing on our own internal feelings and drawing out of us a personal connection to the events unfolding on the screen.  With images that linger on the screen for long periods of time; symbolic clouds of smoke lifting to the ceiling; rich expressions of color gracing a dimly lit room and that constant emotional tenseness that just captures the ultimate meaning in it all; `Fa Yeung Nin Wa' is so incredibly detailed that one could watch it multiple times and still catch something new with each sitting (case and point; I've seen in four times this past week and I still feel it has so much more to tell me).<br /><br />The material is elegantly handled by its two stars, Maggie Cheung and Tony Leung.  Both actors have proven themselves time and time again, but this may be their most committed and ultimately most rewarding performances.  They each understand their characters, the pain of betrayal, the fear of loneliness, the desire to be complete.  They just `get it' and so each scene is elevated by their emotional connection to the material.  Cheung is especially captivating, delivering one of the best performances of the year with her smoldering internal struggle to fulfill herself.<br /><br />I recommend this film without any hesitation and plead with you to see it.  There are few films that can achieve what `Fa Yeung Nin Wa' has achieved.  This is an emotionally stimulating visual feast that is as thought provoking and intelligent as it is beautiful.a personal connection to the events unfolding on the screen.

B001M5UDGS|3.0|I saw the show when it was first on the internet, so I was happy to be able to have a copy I could play for my non-net-savvy relatives.  The music is fun and witty, and a delight to sing along to.  The actors all have pleasant singing voices, and hit their notes spot-on.  All in all, the show is rollicking good fun.    However, I got a DVD-R copy, not a pressed DVD, which I was not expecting.  (Missed that tiny line at the bottom of the description.  The ink on the top of the DVD-R was poorly printed (visible printer lines, and ink smudges out to the edges of the disc), and STILL WET.  I ended up with blue all over my fingers when I popped the DVD out of it's case.  To make matters worse, there was blue ink on the _bottom_ of the disc, as well.  Fortunately, it was also wet, and I was able to clean it off.    I am quite irritated to not receive a pressed DVD.  I'm still going through the disc to see if all the features work properly on my DVD player.    Next time, Amazon, make that line a bit larger, a bit more near the top of the description, and have the product's main-line have a disclaimer in it.  If I'd known it'd be this sloppy, I would have bought the download-version and burned it myself.

0756404746|5.0|Searching the internet for news of A Song of Ice and Fire series by George RR Martin, I found this gem.  One of the best written books I have ever read.  Makes me wonder how many great books I have missed out on.  Patrick Rothfuss brings elements of A Game of Thrones in a Hogwarts setting and gives a more realistic view of magic in the world.  Not inherent magical powers, but the power of the human mind, with elements of magic from folklore.  I would recommend this book to any older fan of the Harry Potter series or fan of ASoIF.      The first 50 pgs are slow, but after you break this point, you can not put it down. Enjoy the read. It is an amazing story.

B001K3JF7K|4.0|.....I would live long enough to give Diana less that five stars. But the day is here. And, I'm not sure but what four is too many. \\"Quiet Nights\\", indeed. Too quiet. The softer, more \\"cuddly\\" Diana just doesn't work.<br /><br />  All singers are prone to suffer by comparison, but when that's the first thought with the first cut....bad. Diana leads off with the old classic \\"Where or When\\"...and I instantly heard Carly Simon's voice in my head. Her version on the 2005 \\"Moonlight Serenade\\" is far superior. I love Carly, and have for 35 years, but when she trumps Diana that fast? Now Carly is at least a valid comparison for Diana; the late Eileen Farrell's valid comparisons are few...Ponselle, Flagstad...the true vocal royalty. Still, when Diana does \\"Too Marvelous for Words\\" and \\"Guess I'll Hang My Tears Out to Dry\\", she sounds weak, anemic. OK. Unfair standard. Yet, there it is....<br /><br />  Two special comments...When I reviewed Renee Olstead's new \\"Skylark\\", I gave her kudos for not gender-bending the lyrics of Ray Charles' classic \\"Hit the Road Jack\\"...no kudos here. I can live with what she did to \\"I've Grown Accustomed to Her Face\\". (\\"HIS\\"). BUT, what she did to \\"The Girl from Ipanema\\" really grates. Really. That song was written for a GIRL to sing. Astrud Gilberto...Elaine Elias....GIRLS. No bending necessary. \\"Boy\\" from Ipanema, indeed! Speaking of Astrud, I admit Diana did fine with the title cut.<br /><br />  Diana, I still love you. Really. Maybe she had a bad day. Maybe she got bad guidance and production...but she's old enough to protect herself from that. I'll look forward to the next album, but save your $$ on this one. Four stars are too many....maybe it's the memory of past glories.....
B001IAOEXU|4.0|One of the main reasons I quit playing Playstation 3 was because I'd literally develop hand-cramps while playing.  The lower triggers on the controller tilted upwards into the unit, whereas your fingers wanted to pull in or almost downwards on them.  This required you to either catch the top edge of the triggers, giving you a very narrow contact point, or change the way you held the controller which resulted in great discomfort.<br /><br />These \\"snap-on\\" additions to the controller bring the contact point out much further, and allows you to pull downwards on the trigger in a much more natural motion.  It's a vast improvement on comfort and gameplay.  It's just not 100% perfect.<br /><br />Since these triggers snap over the existing triggers, you end up with something taller and wider than the original piece.  The \\"wider\\" seems to be the biggest issue, as the new trigger now sits wider than the pad between your finger joints.  It becomes a new spot of discomfort, though not pain-inducing.  The bottom of the trigger also angles out a bit more than it should, so your finger can't sit flat against it and basically \\"slides\\" back towards the top of the trigger... ...where it's too wide.  In the end, your fingers still constantly shift around, trying to find that perfect comfort spot.<br /><br />Being somewhat mechanically and electrically inclined, I'd have preferred a trigger REPLACEMENT, which would require opening the controller and swapping components.  Obviously that would create liability issues out the ying-yang, and wouldn't appeal to the general masses.<br /><br />But these certainly improve gaming comfort while adding a few discomforts of their own.  I still wonder how the original design of the Six-Axis/DualShock 3 controllers was EVER approved for production.
B000SX8AKQ|5.0|I bought \\"Very\\" in 1993...I was 39yrs old and it was a very painful time for me - my wife had left with my best friend. I was already a big fan of PSB and didn't know anything about their sexual orientation - nor did I care. I just loved their well-crafted tunes with a catchy melody, unlike so much other noise in the music industry at the time...    I couldn't stop playing \\"Very\\" for the next 2yrs. Along with counseling, a support group, my church and my faith in God it was also an important element of my recovery and to some degree a soundtrack for my big comeback... Whatever mood I was in there was a song to match - and I always felt better after listening...and often more empowered.     Note that my review is for the original version but I'm sure it applies to this release as well. At the age of 54, this is still one of my all-time favorites......

1400063515|3.0|I enjoyed reading the book, mainly for the reason that now I know I am not the only person in the nit-picking tribe. Like Taleb, I like to find fault in every sentence that I read or hear, and I used to think that I am the most annoying person on Earth. Was I glad to read that my way of thinking can be useful in some circumstances. It should therefore not surprise Taleb when I find fault with some of the things that he said in the book. For example, Taleb was angry with his teacher for interpreting a painting in a certain way, and rejected Taleb's reading of the painting. The teacher said that the characters in a 18th century French painting (I may have got the details wrong) put their mouths into the bowls because they were hungry, not because they were not taught manners, as suggested by Taleb. Well, if the teacher knew more about the background of the painter, such as if he was known to depict social ills in his paintings, then the teacher could very well be correct. In life, people do not couch their language in probabilities, since, for one, accurate probabilities are impossible to obtain in most circumstances and almost all social science circumstances, and second, the listeners have too many things that require their attention that they want to get the point quickly. It is because of practicality that people speak in shortcut forms and leave out the 'if' and 'but's in their statements. Of course, this habit often gets us in trouble, and leads some people to think that most issues can be described in one of two states, e.g. either right or wrong, true or false.     Another example. Taleb faulted a politician after 9/11 for saying that New York had overcome many adversities in the past, so it could come out of 9/11 stronger also. Taleb argues that the past does not predict the future. Merely because NY had overcome difficulties in the past does not guarantee that it would do so in future. Again, I think most people would realize that that guy was speaking as apolitician, not as a prophet. My guess is that he was just trying to boost morale, and be inspirational. Taleb has to accept that often people say things not in a literary sense. If Taleb can see that, then he would be less worried about the future of humankind.  It is also not realistic to expect the majority of people to be critical thinkers, although there may be too few at the moment.
B001QB9H1A|5.0|We have become die hard fans of Jason Statham movies. The Transporter series being one of his best, we own all three. An English actor, Statham was born in Sydenham, on the south east London, growing up playing football and diving. His first experience with movies came from being cast by Guy Ritchie, British director in a 1998 hit Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels and later in the 2000 film Snatch.    In 2008 Statham returns in the role of Frank Martin, a driver that transports cargo without asking questions and under strict rules: Stick to the deal, Don't ask names and Don't look in the package. Statham's martial arts background allows him to perform most of his own stunts and it is simply thrilling to observe him in action.    Transporter 3 brings back our favorite hard driving courier, now under the most difficult of circumstances because if he gets too far from the car he will die. Bad guy Johnson, played by Robert Knepper, demands that an influential politician do as he commands or he will kill his daughter Valentina, played by Natalya Rodakova.    Valentina has been drugged, kidnapped and wears a wrist bracelent bomb that can blow her up if she gets too far from the vehicle. She is being used because of her importance to her father, a Ukranian official played by Jeroen Krabbe, who can sign off the papers to allow toxic cargo in transit in one of the bad guy's ships. One of the most amazing sequences in this film is when Frank Martin stays close to his car through the most amazing chase through buildings, store fronts, alleys and finally how he recovers control of the car.    Frank Martin is good at what he does but when he gets involved and his passion is aroused he is a lethal weapon, unstoppable and effective. If you like action packed movies, this is the series to obtain. Don't miss it!
B001K3JF7K|3.0|I agree with the majority of reviewers.  Actually I turned to the reviews hoping I might have missed something, looking for someone to set me straight.  But after so long a wait this was a real disappointment--lifeless vocals for the most part and nothing to speak of in the way of instrumental technique.  In a word, not at lot here.  And no real comparison to \\"The Look of Love\\" album, as the early reviews suggested.  What's happened to the inventive DK who gave us \\"The Girl in the Other Room\\" and two great live-performance albums only a few years back?  Didn't she have a child or two recently--maybe taking care of home stuff has temporarily distracted her--it happens.  Let's hope for a revival when school begins.  Take care of those kids, and then will the real Diana please come back, we all miss you!
B001I0Z43Y|4.0|I got tired of waiting for Sony to release the 32GB memory stick so I bought one of these and two 16GB micro SD cards (all for less than the price of one 16GB memory stick!)    My PSP would only recognize the adapter intermittently, so I sent it back. The replacement worked perfectly and now I have a 32GB PSP.    Highly recommended, but be aware of the limitations of the adapter (according to the manufacturer):     *It can only be formatted and used in a device (Do not format or transfer data to it with computer's card reader).    *It is essentially a RAID device, so once you stick two cards in, they aren't hot-swappable (you'll have to reformat to use it after changing out a card).     *The micro SDs will have to be reformatted before use in another device (again, because it's a RAID).    Once you can work within its limits, it is a great device. Mine has worked flawlessly for six months now. Just keep returning it until you get a good one!
B000GG4Y3M|4.0|I have yet to find a Ridley Scott film in which he doesn't beat the living snot out of commonly held irrational dislikes (like xenophobia, misogeny, and contempt for cops).  This visually striking film takes fear, loathing and contempt for aliens/Philistines to new extremes of irony and complexity that utterly justify the incredibly ominous title.  I've given it four stars because the multilayered ironies are only fully revealed through the commentary which is reinforced by the other special features.  His stereotypes spin totally counter to their vector, and the closer I watch his very financially-successful entertainments, there more art there is to see.  That's not the way this stuff is supposed to work.
B001K3JF7K|4.0|I question whether this was the album she wanted to make, or the album Verve wanted her to make.  She already visited this territory to great effect on Look of Love and I can't help but wonder if this wasn't a record-company-cash-in.     Bill Evans was noted for dragging out old war horses and blowing everyone away with an arrangement+performance that made the songs seem brand new.  Quiet Nights is not a bad performance, but it does nothing to reinvent the way you'll think about these songs.     As a point of reference, check out a title called Bossa Nova (original, eh?) by a Brazilian singer named Ana Caram. If I had to pick a definitive recording of Bossa standards to put in a museum side-by-side with the originals, that's it.      Get this CD because it sounds nice and Diana looks fantastic on the cover, not because it's going to blow your mind.

0553103547|3.0|Without a doubt, George R.R. Martin is a fantastic writer.  Measuring him with the typical yardsticks for what makes a good author will not find him wanting.  His prose is concise yet marvelously descriptive and unlike many authors in the fantasy genre, he keeps the story moving without plodding through setting the stage.  His dialog is also excellent and his ability to intertwine characterization with keeping their dialog consistent and entertaining is top notch.  He clearly has a very clever mind, as his plots are well thought out, complicated without being ridiculous or confusing, intricate, and engrossing.<br /><br />With all of these great attributes, it's a shame his books are ruined by Martin's handling of sex.  In the first three books (I haven't read the fourth), the scenes where any kind of sexual activity takes place are so out of place, so graphic, and so jarring, they remove you from the story.  One minute a character is deeply embroiled in a web of intrigue, and the next scene could come straight from a porno.  I'm not a fundamentalist christian or have any problems with sex in literature, but Martin just doesn't deal with it well.  It seems like all of his characters are psychotic sexual deviants who are incapable of levels of intimacy which fall into any kind of normal spectrum.  On top of that the level of detail he goes into and the kinds of depraved acts (from mass incest to torture during sex) are just so horrid that they really detract from the story.<br /><br />I'm honestly not sure what bothers me the most about it.  Is it that he portrays such horrible things in such detail, or that he actually isn't embarrassed to have come up with these ideas and put them into print for the public to read.  It really makes me think he's just a sick person, and is titillated by writing these scenes as opposed to actually trying to tell a story while writing them.<br /><br />He deals with violence in a similar graphic fashion, and one might dig up the old argument that it is hypocritical to criticize graphic use of sex and not graphic use of violence.  But the violence ends up fitting into the story far better as the setting is a medieval, militaristic society.  When someone in the story is killed in a graphic scene of violence during an epic battle, this doesn't pull you out of the story, but instead very much drives the story home.  By contrast, the sex scenes almost always feel out of place and do the exact opposite.  In a pulpier fantasy novel this is to be expected, but with Martin's complex, political plot lines, it's a distraction.<br /><br />These books are still very much worth reading, but they could have been absolutely brilliant classics on the level of Tolkien, Moorcock, or Howard had they not possessed this critical flaw.tical to criticize graphic use of sex and not graphic use of violence.

B00127RAJY|5.0|Hi all,<br />I just got this, last night 4/1/09. I just got through doing Level 1 and it kicked my butt. I had to do the modified version on some of the exercises and had to lose the weights on some of them also.  I go to the gym 3-4 times a week and do about 40-60 minutes on cardio. This video just proves to me how out of shape I really am. I was sweating like crazy and out of breath doing this video. Jillian knows what she is doing. I have been also doing some other videos that she has on Netflix. We can add it to our instant queue and watch it on the TV and those also kick my butt.  I got this video for a few reasons,it had so many reviews but also because I am not going to the gym as much because I have a little boy and I go to a military gym and they don't have daycare and because I hate working out with so many men. No offense. And gym memberships cost a fortune and I wanted to try something like this before I wasted my money on a gym membership.  I so far am very thrilled with this DVD and looking forward to do more of it. I will update when I have done it for a little while longer.<br />Update: 4-14-09<br />You got to make sure you do the moves correctly. I tore up the tendons in my knees so bad that I had to go to the Dr. I am sure this is entirely my fault. I thought I was doing everything right but I guess not. There is a lot of jumping so be wary of that. I still love this DVD and my legs are getting better so I will be back at it soon.
0679746048|4.0|This is alot like One flew over the Cuckoo's Nest and Bell Jar. It is not as descriptive as the other books, but does lend alot of insights in the psychiatric ward's in the 1960's..<br />all that Freud crap.<br />Really interesting and easy read.
1416914293|5.0|I loved this book so much that even though I usually just get my books from the library I bought it and the other two books in the series.

6305320802|3.0|Lets be honest here! What Fox wants you to believe is utter rubbish! Having been involved in film to video restoration as a telecine colorist I think I know a little bit about the process.    The one thing that Fox is right about is that many negs, ip's and print negs were stored impropperly. Eastman stock developed vinigar syndrome, faded and shrunk. Becoming unusable. The studio's woke up to the fact and started to store  their precious titles in more climate friendly vaults and salt mines. Yup...salt mines.     I have seen several prints, (not negs) in theatres and in private collections. Some have faded and lost color, (turning pink) while others are basicly as beautiful as they day they were struck.     If Fox wnted to do an \\"HONEST\\" transfer of a TODD-AO print or neg, it could have used numerous sources to obtain, borrow or copy elements from existing materials other than a badly damaged IP. IP's (inter Posatives) that some studios will xfer from are well known to have limited range and depth for video xfers than a neg or a print-neg.  Fox was being lazy and decided for some unknown reason to use most likely the only complete, or close at hand elements they had rather than do some research and find propper materials to xfer from!    The story abotu Oklahoma! being soft is that....a story. All the prints and footage and frames from TODD-AO prints are anything but soft. The efinition is the Oklahoma! prints is truely breath taking.     Fox would have been better to have left some of the film damage in and retain the sharpness of the TODD-AO versions. Fox woudl have been bette to have used the available technology and use the pre-existing 4x3 letterbox TODD-AO version and line doubled it to make it full screen.     You would be amazed aas to the amount of color that can be pulled out of a faded print using sate of the art equipment like a daVinci color corrector. Would the color be perfect? No, but it would be sharp and enjoyable. Then they could have gone into digital color restoration and boosted it up even more.     If Fox have have had the backbone to have said \\"hey we made a mistake\\" I woudl respect that and say well atlet they know they messed up. But to blaitantly lie and try to defent themselves is not only an insult to this film, it's producers, cast and crew, it's fans and to those of us who do work in the area of film xfer!    Fox, I challenge you to prove this is the only possible xfer that you can do! And you will be proved wrong!
1594201927|3.0|I've read a few books by Mr. Ferguson and have enjoyed them all.  This one is definitely the \\"weak link\\" of the bunch however.  It seems to start off as titled but then jumps ahead to turn of the century material and retreads a lot a ground from his previous works.  I can't say I didn't like the book - I did.  I just think it could have been worked thru a little better, and even titled differently, or kept more on the stated title.
B000OVLBFS|5.0|I am a Tom Selleck fan. So whatever he does is great. He is the perfect Jesse Stone. We have all the tapes thus far. What's great is this film is a \\"man's\\" film and it's great, but it's TOM SELLECK!

B000VUCIZO|1.0|I found this to be a seriously poor book, in many ways, the title \\"iWoz\\" tells you everything you need to know. And it's not good.    Wozniak was lucky to be in the right place at the right time to grab a lift on Job's back. The Apple computer he's famous for designing had a number of serious design flaws (much less publicised) because Woz didn't understand the 6502 processor employed (why did he use it then? because it was dirt cheap).    Woz had nothing to do with the Mac and certainly not any of the \\"i\\" products (iPod, iPhone, iMac) so why the allusion to these in the title: that's the theme of this book. Somehow merely by being alive he claims to have contributed to this.    The book isn't even saved by being well written.    In every way poor: poor story, verging on dishonest and poorly written. Avoid.
0375842209|5.0|When I picked up 'The Book Thief' at the store, I was a little wary -- it's narrated by Death.  I'm not sorry I decided to bring it home.<br /><br />This is a story about a girl during the Nazi occupation of Germany.  And yes, parts of it are heartbreaking - and parts of it are humorous.  Zusak is very talented, and his writing in this particular book is the strongest I've read in quite some time.  The story rings true all the way through, and the ultimate message is that of hope.
B001NFNFNU|5.0|A really fine movie, enjoyable and interesting.  Wish we had more movies like this.  The caption was not automatic, had to be turned on.
0307454894|5.0|There is very little doubt that this is an outstanding book;  there is also little doubt that the movie was also very good.  There is often a controversy and debate as to whether the book or the movie is better;  I think this is one of the situations where they complement each other.  The book provides a deeper insight into the psyche of the characters and helps one understand more fully their actions and motivations.  The movie provides stunning visual images of the intense emotional drama. I saw the movie first, and thought that Kate Winslet was outstanding as Hana;  it was only after I read the book (actually listened to it on audio), that I truly appreciated what an extraordinary performance Winslet gave of a very complex person.  Well deserving of her Academy Award.  A similar complementary scenario was No Country for Old Men - the movie and the book.   Igor Dumbadze
B001KP2Y3K|1.0|I became an immediate fan of Madeleine Peyroux when I first listened to Careless Love, still one of my favorite albums, so when I saw the announcement for this offering I pre-ordered it. I have to say that the final product is a big disappointment. All the songs sound alike and the delivery is so low-key that I can't listen to it while driving because I'm afraid I will fall asleep. Probably the biggest shock is the way she sounds. Her voice normally is capable of doing justice to even the quirkiest Leonard Cohen song (Blue Alert is spectacularly good), but here she sounds like my mother singing in the shower. If this is what the future holds for her I may have bought my last Madeleine Peyroux album.
B0015HOFZI|4.0|Very nifty product, well-designed with start/stop/lift buttons and automatic lift at end of LP.     I, too, had a problem at first getting my laptop to monitor the sound during recording. The recommended audio changes were checked and applied in the Control Panel (XP), still no sound. But, as another reviewer suggested, go into the Soundforce software and click to Options/Preferences/Audio, re-select the Micosoft default, click Apply/OK -- and the sound flowed out. Apparently it needed to be re-selected even though it was the default player.    The sound on the burned CD was excellent, even without correcting it. On some of my older, and scratched, LPs I probably will correct and see how that option delivers. Also, it's great that the software -- after your recording is done -- allows you to burn right to a CD rather than first having to load up your hard-drive with audio files.    And, as another reviewer mentioned, it would be nice if the RCA cables were detachable from the unit. That way I could leave them plugged into the stereo system and easily remove/replace the phono in the components cabinet instead of fiddling with the back of the receiver to unplug it.    Convenience preferences, is all. Otherwise, very pleased with unit after one night of recording.

B001PPLJIQ|4.0|I have just watched the film for the third time. There is one loose end which made me feel unsatisfied when I left my seat. We never got to see what role Hanna REALLY played in the burning down of the church. Normally, films show flashbacks to what happened). For all we know, Hanna may not have played any role in the church event. She seems a pretty decent person as seen by her benevolence towards the young chap. She may, for example, have tried to stop the other 5 women from doing whay they did. This makes me wonder if she was wronged.

B001QUL73W|5.0|I've already enjoyed Petrenko leading the RLPO (Royal Liverpool Philharmonic Orchestra) in Tchaikovsky's huge symphony-tone poem, Manfred.  I also noted that not everybody got as much out of hearing that disc as I did, with some distinctively negative review notes sounded in passing.  I also enjoyed the way that Petrenko worked with pianist Eldar Nebolsin on their Liszt concertos disc, though yet again some reviewers found either the players (or Liszt's music) wanting.<br /><br />So here we go again.  Bottom line is, I think this disc is possibly the very best of the three discs from Naxos.  I like the other two just fine, for slightly different reasons; but this Shostakovich Eleventh Symphony brings it all together, reaching new sonic and musical heights.  I also think this particular reading can stand comparison with the best of the available catalog and come off very high, if not in some minds and hearts and ears, the highest so far.  I cannot quite recall a similarly auspicious young conductor debut in Shostakovich, since the unhappily aborted Phllips Universal label debut of the young Semyon Bychkov.<br /><br />Maybe we can attribute some of this success to the conductor settling in, quite nicely as a significant musical team, with the band?  Petrenko has been working with RLPO, since at least 2006.  From all indications on this new disc, the conductor and the band are hand in glove, at least from the sound of it.  Add in the composer's high stakes in this musical proceeding; and we get one of those Russian Troika configurations, wild, powerful, pulling us fiercely across the shining snow and ice of hard winter.<br /><br />In Shostakovich' opus, this symphony is all about hard Russian winter.  Or, to be more historically accurate, a famous massacre of the protesting low income and starving citizenry that took place outside the Czar's winter palace, in hard winter.  (Nicholas II)  The palace guards fired into a crowd who were gathered peacefully; killing in allsomewhere over two hundred people.  Thus, the composer's fiftieth birthday roughly coincided with national commemorations of the Julian calendar's January 9th, 1905.  The existing Soviet state apparatus was also partly rehabilitating the composer politically  - yet again - as a duly noted Russian Revolution Artist.  So, for various contemporary reasons everybody yet again had a lot riding on what Shostakovich might or might not manage in his newest symphony.<br /><br />Happily, to my ears, Petrenko and the RLPO get it all pretty much right in this reading.<br /><br />The opening is a remarkable success.  Petrenko and the RLPO Players combine an introductory, scene-setting cinematic narrative flow with a musically canny and flexible unfolding of the harmonic tensions implicit, predictive in those long opening melodies. Such an opening is as much as many good readings of this symphony can manage to offer us.  Petrenko and the RLPO players, however, go even further.  The grim, relentless tread of the rhythmic motive underpins and portends the gathering sounds of an impending tragedy without falling apart, too much or too little.  Given what the composer does in the low end of the orchestra, the challenges of pacing, integrating, combining all the right touches with an unimpeded narrative or musical flow is at least as difficult as Sibelius' later symphonies from the fourth onwards.  A very good performance can get away with managing one or two of these musical dimensions, enough to make considerable musical points, leaving us fairly happy we listened.<br /><br />A great reading brings it all together, and the whole music just snaps vividly, fiercely into sharp focus.  Folk songs, cinema, history, music - bringing us powerfully back to ourselves as humanity.<br /><br />The second movement which spells out the deadly events, is also effectively paced and shaped.  Here the difficult balance to be struck among the rhythmic motif, the cinematic narratives, and the ambivalently coded pure music of western symphonic music in the twentieth century is ringing, clear as a bell.  The Allegro assault gathers in a dramatic or brilliant repeat of Prokofiev's Alexander Nevsky Battle On The Ice; then sounds touches of lament as all fades into the melancholy yet knowing evocations of the third movement.<br /><br />In that third movement, Shostakovich apparently wanted to connote not just memory, but eternal memory.  One may either read that eternity bit as a piece of required Soviet revolutionary hype; the progress of the revolution was after all State Hyperbole - supposed to be the raising of all humanity -  from domination to freedom, to progress, and to well-met feeling among all global brothers and sisters.<br /><br />Or, one may recall the many-sided codes and contexts which make Shostakovich a sort of uniquely modern master, as if his pure music were more indebted to Artificial Musical Intelligence (better than our worst political selves?) than we ordinarily comprehend.  Again, the problems of pacing this movement's music are akin to dilemmas about how to do Sibelius' fourth or later symphonies.  Again, I hear Petrenko and RLPO getting it just about as right as anybody else on disc so far.  Certainly, surpassing other big name conductors whose eleventh symphonies have left me partly impressed, partly disappointed. (Rostropovich, Pletnev,  Haitink, Jansons, Ashkenazy, even the marvelous Oleg Caetani).  Certainly, right up there with my personal fav shelf bench marks (Mravinsky, Ormandy, Cluytens, Stokowski, Barshai, Bychkov with Berlin).<br /><br />The concluding fourth movement is all motion, vigor, and circular music on point cycling and re-cycling.  Who is chasing whom?  Who is mindlessly repeating what tragedy, what injustice?  To my hearing, Petrenko manages to deepen the required surface gloss of Soviet revolutionary martial triumph with that coded emptiness of gesture and purposeless that tells us the revolution was not a rise, not the Great Leap forward it proclaimed itself so loudly to be.  I also think I hear very nice passing touches of the great mass of ordinary citizens, just going about their daily business, anyway.  Allusions to western polyphony, canon, waltz - a bigger and deeper human heritage that even the iron fists of dictatorship or global business cannot quite take away from us.  I also hear touches of constantly passing risk and danger; as if Eisenhower were still with us, say, warning about the dangers of the military-industrial complex in western democracies.<br /><br />Are those final massed alarms, a warning from the state and the secret service police to the cowering populace?  Or, a coded warning to all the big bosses, from all those so long abused, murdered, and repressed, living or dead?<br /><br />The last slow coda returns us to the Eternal Memory movement.  Tender is the Great Vision of Peace, Equality.  Unfinished, unrealized is the Wondrous Vision of a generous and capable humanity, all engaged productively, all living fulfilled in some real peace.  Is this last business of the music, the sawmill buzz of bottomless greed?  Bottomless domination? Or, the near-mystical Last Apocalypse of some impossible yet Just, irrevocable consequence finally crashing in?  No doubt the party bosses at the world premiere heard it one way.  How will we hear it?<br /><br />A listener is left thinking - as in the best of the Yevgeny Mravinsky readings with Leningrad - just how marvelous, intelligent, and deeply human Shostakovich was as a world artist, not just as a famous Russian artist.  This is the difference, say, between a reading of Tchaikovsky's sixth symphony that is replete with sad, compelling personal anguish or secret sexual-romantic tragedy; and a musical reading that reaches even deeper, into what Germans might call, Zeitgeist, Weltschmerz.<br /><br />Very highly recommended.  If the remainder of this proposed complete symphony cycle can keep up the commitment and the musical quality of this disc; we are in for one of the really great Shostakovich symphony sets so far captured in the catalog.  Unfairly, this start raises the stakes very high, indeed.  Yes, in some idealized vision I still wish we could have had a complete set from Mravinsky and Leningrad in very good stereo PCM sound, if not in super audio surround sound.  But, lacking that wish, this is a serious start on reaching high in the complete symphonies. (Ah, Naxos: Super audio?  Sometime?)

B000IVW25M|5.0|The movie is great - although I do think - only MY opinion - the tape was duped - but irregardless we wanted it for the children to watch - not to keep as a future \\"investment\\" or anything else.  We bought it strictly for entertainment purposes.  I say I think it was duped because every 10 minutes or so a video recorder icon comes up on the right hand screen and the inside of the video - where the DVD's are - is not at all like the other Disney Videos we have bought directly from the store.  Would I buy from the seller again - yes I would because as I said - we buy them strictly for entertainment.  We were able to get the movie and watch it and that is what I was wanting.
0374139563|3.0|Dead Aid is an interesting, provocative look at the foreign aid industry and its effects on Africa. Dambisa Moyo, who formerly worked for Goldman Sachs and the World Bank, draws a conclusion not unknown to others in the field: development aid (as differentiated from humanitarian aid) has not only done little good for the nations of Africa but has indeed caused great harm. While I don't necessarily disagree with her conclusion, I didn't find her arguments particularly convincing.<br /><br />There is no question that much of the aid intended to build economies in Africa has been grossly wasted, stolen, and misused. There is little to show for the trillions of dollars that have been poured into the continent--a failure with numerous causes. But Moyo's main premise is that aid itself is the cause, that it creates a culture dependent on foreign handouts and rife with corruption that, according to the author, apparently wouldn't exist if aid weren't available. I find both arguments hard to swallow, especially since they are based mostly on the logical premise of cum hoc ergo propter hoc (with this, therefore because of this). In this thinking, when aid is given, the recipients don't develop other resources, therefore aid causes them to not try. It's the same argument that's been used for years to oppose welfare programs applied in this instance not to individuals, but to entire nations. I find that a little facile. I suspect aid fails more often because it is poorly structured and managed, an argument that Moyo essentially dismisses out of hand.<br /><br />Whether you agree with Moyo's reasoning or not, you have to seriously question the solutions she proposes. While outlining a litany of worthwhile approaches to economic development including micro-lending, opening markets in the developed world to African products, and more foreign direct investment (FDI), her silver bullet is a solution only an investment banker could love: the bond market. Somehow, Moyo expects the magic of the free market financial system to end corruption in Africa, stop wasteful spending, and power the continent out of poverty. I react to that proposal the same way Jaime Talon, one of the lead characters in my novel, [[ASIN:1601641575 Heart of Diamonds: A Novel of Scandal, Love and Death in the Congo]], did when confronted by a similar argument about a panhandler in New York: \\"What matters is that right now--today--that man over there is hungry. Somebody needs to do something about that, not just ignore it and hope the holy and all-powerful market economy will provide a solution.\\"<br /><br />I have to ask, given the brilliant performance of Wall Street and Fleet Street in providing structured finance for America and Europe, how can we expect them to solve the problems of Africa? These are the people who brought us sub-sub-prime mortgages wrapped in gilt-edged bond ratings and called gold. Their ability to assess risk and police wasteful government spending in Kinshasa is rather suspect, at least to me. I also fail to see how corrupt leaders and their minions will be any less likely to steal funds from private lenders than they are from the World Bank. Perhaps my most significant objection, though is when Moyo says the developing nations will be better served paying ten percent interest (the rate she quotes for emerging market debt in 2007) than the 0.75% they are charged by the World Bank. How does that work to anyone's advantage other than the investment bankers?<br /><br />Don't misunderstand my review. I agree with many of Moyos' conclusions and her objections to the current approach to foreign aid. Mandating the purchase of American products with American aid dollars, for example, is enormously wasteful, self-serving, and undoubtedly harms the African farmers and manufacturers such aid could help. She's also dead on when she calls for an improved business climate in Africa so that direct investment, both foreign and local, stands a better chance to succeed.<br /><br />Pulling Africa out of the swamp of poverty is a complex operation. I applaud Dambisa Moyo for presenting a provocative set of arguments in clear, understandable layman's prose. Dead Aid brings an important subject into the public eye.swamp of poverty is a complex operation.

B001MEJY8W|5.0|First I have to say that all the hype about the violent nature of this movie was far too exaggerated. I`m an horror film fan since the tender age of 16 (now I`m 37) and I`ve seen hundreds of films that were more grotesquely and perversely violent than this one. On the other hand I have to admit that I saw the German rental DVD and I`m not quite sure if the film was cut or not. There was little information on the net and from the film itself it was not possible to tell if the German censors had again a field day with that movie, because even after 60 years after the Nazi regime art has no free right in this country to tell, or to show what it has to show, but that`s a different story. In May I can tell you more about the nature of the film, when I get the unrated American edition on DVD from Amazon and can compare it to the German one. Even if the movie I saw was cut, it`s still a far cry from things like Saw and Hostel, especially when it comes to term of the quality and the story of the film. What started with Alexandre Aja`s film High Tension in 2005 and found it`s following with Alexandre Bustillo`s and Julien Maury`s Inside in 2007and Xavier Gens` movie Frontier(s) in 2008 French horror directors have delivered films that stand mountain high above the genre outings from the States. I hope I allowed to quote from the DVD review of that movie from the Fangoria home page that these films are \\"...a shining artistic beacon to the rest of the genre world.\\" There is nothing more to say about this.
B001EO748M|5.0|Love it....its like watching soft porn!  Who know how much mischief really transpired, and I am certain the English people were not the perfect physical specimens as being portrayed in the series, but this series makes for great viewing!
0440244870|4.0|Being a faithful fan of Bridget Jones diaries for a very long time, I was desperate to find books that gave me the same feel. I finally found them! Sophie Kinsella really pulls it off in this one. \\"Confessions of a Shopaholic\\" is by far superior to another book of hers that I read first \\"Remember Me?\\" It is funny, cute, lighthearted with a little bit of romance thrown in. There is no point to get into the details of the story, there are already plenty of plot spoilers on this site. Just pick up this book and enjoy. I will definitely read next book in the Shopaholic series - \\"Shopaholic takes Manhattan.\\"
B000001FMX|1.0|One word can summarize this album: Yawn! It's boring, predictable and generic. They all had to rely on dressing like transvestites for this album to sell and failed epically. Check out Green Day for real punk.
B001K3JF7K|5.0|If you are truly a Diana Krall enthusiast, you will like this album.  Forget the naysayers out there.  Her voice is breathy and romantic.  The orchestration is lovely.  This album is for \\"quiet nights\\" as the title suggests.  You will not be disappointed.  I love this record and I believe it's one of the best things she has done since her Grammy award winning album \\"When I Look In Your Eyes\\".  Simply superb!
B001R7IHA0|5.0|I have been listening to Keith's Defying Gravity CD for two days straight at work, and the more I listen to it the more I love it!  I have been a fan of Keith's since 1997.  I have every CD that he has ever put out, even the one he did in Australia.  If you really love songs that are about love, then this CD is perfect.  There are some ballad type songs, and then there are the ones that make you want to get up and dance.  My favorite song is Hit the Ground Running.  It is upbeat and just makes you smile everytime you listen to it!  I hope you go and get the CD, and enjoy!!!
1416914307|5.0|I really enjoyed the book, and it was well written as well as entertaining. I loved the characters, and the development among them and the story line was absolutely delightful (well, you know what I mean...). It was bittersweet, as it is the last of the trilogy, but I couldn't have asked for anything more (except maybe another 500 pages...)
044024367X|1.0|This awful book can be read as a murder mystery of sorts.  The mystery is: why did Lee Child murder his character Jack Reacher?  Reacher has died and been replaced by a lecturing liberal, anti-Christian conspiracy nut with a hatred of the military and, worse, a condescending attitude toward soldiers.  Oh, and he's now a murdering thug as well who causes the irradiation of several square miles of Colorado.    The Christian preacher-villan is obviously modeled on a left wing perception of President G. W. Bush who plans a terror bombing clearly based on the inane 911 \\"inside job\\" conspiracy theories.  Puh-leeze!    I had really enjoyed the Jack Reacher novels these past few years, but the character has now been so tainted I won't be able to read another.  I guess Child has become so rich off his novels that he has \\"nothing to lose\\" by giving his readers and his adopted country the finger.
B001MYIXAW|1.0|\\"Let The Right One In\\" is without a doubt one the best films of 2008, bar none. Atmospheric, touching, chilling, disturbing, and haunting, it will remain with you for days after your first viewing experience.    That being said I was REALLY anticipating the Blu-ray release. Unfortunately, Magnet/Magnolia Pictures decided to REPLACE the theatrical subtitles with a new translation for home video. The result? A different film altogether. The egregious aspects of this are:    * There is NO indication anywhere on the product packaging that the subtitles on the disc differ from the theatrical subs.  * Magnet/Magnolia has acknowledged the problem in a press release and has stated publicly that future pressings of \\"Let The Right One In\\" will include the ORIGINAL theatrical subtitles in addition to the subs on the current disc.  * Magnet/Magnolia IS NOT OFFERING ANY KIND OF TRADE-IN OR REPLACEMENT PROGRAM FOR CUSTOMERS WHO PURCHASED THE CURRENT \\"DEFECTIVE\\" DISC!!!! In other words, if you own the \\"defective\\" release and you want the original theatrical subtitles, you'll have to spend an additional $20-$25 for the \\"new\\" disc to get them!!    Because this release has been significantly altered from its original theatrical form, AND because Magnet/Magnolia seems to have no respect for it's customers or any concept of what customer service means, I'm giving this release of \\"Let The Right One In\\" a single star. DON'T BUY IT. Send a message to the studio that treating their customers in this way has financial consequences. Maybe that's something they WILL understand.
0439023483|5.0|Again all I can say is wow!  I love this book it is wonderfully writen. It has action, adventure, polical intrigue, and yes romance.  I could not put this book and never have I been this excited about a book since Harry Potter and Twilight.  I can't wait for the next book to find out what will happen to Katniss \\"The Girl on Fire.\\"

B000A0GYD2|5.0|From the Earth to the moon is the best HBO series ever made.  It gives an in depth look into the beginings of the space program, without making it a technical journal.  The stories of the men and women who lived through this exciting time period gives you hope for the future of mankind today.  If we could make it to the moon with all of the problems and uncertainties these people faced, then what else is the human race capable of.
1400064287|5.0|One of the best books about how to make ideas \\"stick\\" in the minds of your audience.

B000002LGQ|5.0|\\"Like A Prayer\\" is one of my favorite Madonna albums.  On this album, she showed real artistic growth.  She broadened her horizons considerably, both musically and thematically, including many personal revelations.  The title song, with its spiritual references and gospel choir, remains one of Madonna's best-known hits.  \\"Express Yourself\\" became an anthem, and I'm sure that many people decided to follow her advice and \\"...make him express how he feels\\".  \\"Love Song\\", a duet with Prince, is certainly odd, but it shows Madonna's willingness to stretch and, contrary to popular belief, to share the spotlight with someone whose ego is at least as large as hers.  \\"Till Death Do Us Part\\" is a deceptively light pop tune with dark overtones, and lyrics that refer to difficulties in a relationship with someone I think we all recognize.  \\"Promise To Try\\" is a remembrance of her mother, who passed away when Madonna was very young;  this seems to have haunted her throughout her life.  \\"Cherish\\" is such a perfect, tight classic pop track that it should be placed in a time capsule for future generations to contemplate.  In it, Madonna references not only The Association's 1966 \\"Cherish\\", but also Romeo and Juliet.  Not bad for a little pop hit.  On \\"Dear Jessie\\" Madonna has fun with strings and percussion while sweetly singing to a little girl destined to be happy forever in a colorful fairytale land.  \\"Oh Father\\" moves me very much, and I'm sure Madonna's close relationship with her own father inspired this somber track.  \\"Keep It Together\\", another song about family ties, echoes the sound of Sly & The Family Stone's hit \\"Family Affair\\".  The dramatic ballad \\"Spanish Eyes\\", with lyrics about \\"the barrio\\", is gorgeous, especially the high refrain \\"I light this candle, and watch it throw/Tears on my pillow\\".  Finally, we have the former Catholic girl's musical version of the \\"Act of Contrition\\".  Now, I was a good Catholic boy, and I attended 8 years of Catholic school, so I said this prayer many times, but I don't remember it ever being this much fun.  I especially like the line \\"...who art all good/Like I knew you would\\".  But that's the thing about Madonna.  Whether her music is happy or serious, it is usually enjoyable.  I always feel that I've had a good time after listening to it.this prayer many times, but I don't remember it ever being this much fun.

B001R7IHA0|5.0|Love this album.  I own every one of Keith's albums, and this is one of my very favorite ones.  The more I play it, the more I love it.
B001EYGOEM|5.0|I find that sometimes a musician will have an awesome first album, then the next album comes out and just doesn't quite have it... This is so not the case here. It has that Taylor Swift sound that you love, but is new and fresh. Her sound has definitely evolved without becoming unrecognizable.   Stand out songs I think are:   *Fearless, the title track, that has those awesome lyrics that are so simple that Taylor Swift always seems to come up with. Sweet message about loving a boy that makes her feel fearless. Makes you feel good.  *White Horse - Ballad about being treated badly by a guy and all the feelings that go along with that.  This is a song that definitely sounded different to me initally (when I heard it on Grey's). It's not as country as some of her other songs. Love, love, love the lyrics.  *Breathe feat. Colbie Caillat - Slow song with lyrics about a separation from someone you love and how hard that is. Simple beat. Love the sound of Taylor and Colbie singing together on the chorus. I love singing along to this in my car. It has so much emotion.   *You're Not Sorry - Slower song about a guy who treats a girl badly, leads her on, lies, apologizes when he doesn't really mean it (hence the title). It's about finally waking up and realizing you're too good for that guy (haven't we all been there?). Catchy chorus. Nice beat.  *The Best Day - This song reminds me a little of Colbie Caillat's style of music as well. It doesn't necessarily have to be considered country, especially if you don't know Taylor Swift. Just a sweet, simple song about her mom. I love it. Plus, my mom is awesome, and I always think of her when I listen to it. Really a sweet thing to write a song for your mom I think (and it's not cheesy like you might think it could be).  *Change - This song is upbeat. It's about being the one to believe in change when not everyone does and some even want to stop you and keep things the same. And how good it feels when that much needed change comes along. Very feel good song and passionate.    I have lots of favorites on here as you can see, but these are the ones that really stick out to me. I like every song on the album, but these are the best (I think). I also have to say that I'm not a huge country music fan. I like Taylor Swift because she has a good voice, simple songs that are fun and catchy with good lyrics. She doesn't sound super country when she sings, and there aren't a bunch of country-style instruments. It's just about the music. It sometimes doesn't even sound like country.
0312330529|5.0|Simply one of the most spectacular books I have ever read!  Books that capture you this well only come around once every decade or so... sigh... I guess I'll have to wait another 10 years for the next one.
B001DDBCUU|5.0|This movie was so good. It did not stray from the style of the show. It stayed true to the series. Of course, the characters evolved and grew and even grew up in a lot of ways. They matured due to the changes and circumstances of their lives. The characters were still the characters we knew and loved from the series. I really feel that they did the show justice with this movie. It was great to see where the ladies ended up a few years after the show. And I think, even though the show is unrealistic to many of us (due to extravagant clothes and things like that), that there were still things normal women of different ages, from different areas of the country, and different income levels can identify with... Things like marital/relationship problems, friend issues, life changes, etc. And even my boyfriend likes this movie, and he is a guy's guy.    And you can't forget about the things that made SATC a cultural phenomenon: sex, wit, fashion, friendship, and frankness. It's all still there.
B001R0KH3M|5.0|This is the best concert DVD I have ever seen. I love it, love it, love it!  I felt like I was there.  I am recommending that everybody purchase this DVD, you won't be disappointed and it is a must-have for all Stevie Wonder fans.
B001F0VHEM|5.0|I have been a fan of Pink for a long time. It seems like she always sounds new and fresh, but not so different that you can't tell it's her. This album is awesome. My breakdown:    1. So What - Totally Pink. It is the first single that I'm sure most people are familiar with. In my opinion, it is by far not the best on the album (as often is the case with singles I think).    2. Sober - This song is so rock 'n roll Pink. It's very raw with emotion. Her voice is so rock star in the chorus. It's her talking about giving up alcohol and the effect it has on her life. Amazing. Serious, but definitely not boring.    3. I Don't Believe You - This song is also raw with emotion. It's about being in a relationship and the realization (and then subsequent denial) that the person you love doesn't want to be with you anymore. Another song that makes you feel something, but that is also fun to belt out in the car.    4. One Foot Wrong - I LOVE this song. I think that many people said they didn't when reviewing it, but it has awesome lyrics, a catchy beat, Pink's awesome rock star voice. What more can you ask for?    5. Please Don't Leave Me - A fun (beat), yet emotional song about the ups and downs of a relationship, the faults of one person in the relationship (not blame, but rather owning up to some of her own), and also a real vulnerability is shown.     6. Bad Influence - In the spirit of 'Cuz I Can from her previous album, I'm not dead. It's very fun, very in your face, and not caring what anyone else thinks. One of the many reasons we love Pink.    7. Funhouse - A fun song about tearing down the house because it's no longer fun (perhaps a metaphor referring to the home she built with someone she is no longer with). There is pain in the song, but it's funny at times as well (lyrically). And of course amazing Pink vocals.    8. Crystal Ball - Slow song. Really good lyrics. And of course love her voice. This song is mostly about her voice and the lyrics. The music in the background is simple, but really fits the song. It's really almost got a rock ballad type feel to it... Not pop at all.    9. Mean - This is so southern rock. It's about being in a relationship and realizing that you're taking each other for granted and basically just being mean now. Really good. Full of emotion.    10. It's All Your Fault - I love this song. The beat is different--don't really know how to describe it even. It has a catchy chorus, but I wouldn't say the rest of the song is very poppy. I love the third verse. It really hits you. You will just have to listen to it for that--I'm not giving anything away.    11. Ave Marie A - I feel like this song could be in a musical or something. It's very in your face with a good message about all the violence and just plain badness in the world. Really good.    12. Glitter In the Air - A very simple song. Beautiful lyrics. Beautiful voice.     All in all, a really good album. I would definitely recommend it and do to all my friends and family.
B0001GOH6Q|5.0|This movie is really inspiring and makes you realize that your life will only be as interesting and fulfilling as you want to. It may not be a fast paced film, but if you are in the mood for some eye candy scenery and a comforting, fun, and touching film you will not be disappointed. It is definitely a movie that you have to watch at least once in your life time.
B001GM28HO|5.0|So, I was really hesitant about this whole Lady Gaga phenomenon... Her name is kind of ridiculous, what I had seen of her previously was a little outrageous and over the top... Plus, I had only heard very little of Just Dance--mostly just the chorus, which is catchy, but didn't really make me want to hear more. So, here's my breakdown:    1. Just Dance - Very techno, club music. The chorus is catchy but is not what draws you in. The lyrics are not really deep or anything (that isn't Lady Gaga's style), but they are fun.    2. LoveGame - This song is ridiculous, but fun. The chorus is so catchy. It's just a feel-good song that you will play loudly in the car just jammin' out.     3. Paparazzi - This song has the same feel, but isn't as techno-dance-music like. It's a little slower. Love her voice. You can actually get a little more of a feel of it here. And the song isn't actually about the paparazzi...    4. Poker Face - The second single, which I'm sure most people are familiar with. I wasn't as I don't listen to the radio very often. My friend played this song for me, and I thought it was super fun and catchy. The song also has that techno, club song feel (but not in the annoying way that many of that type are). It just has funny lyrics that make you laugh and have a good tine.    5. Eh, Eh (Nothing Else I Can Say) - This song has a different feel, kind of a retro sound to it. It's not really techno, but it's fun to sing along to. Her voice is really good (which we know isn't always the case with singers these days).    6. Beautiful, Dirty, Rich - This song I guess would be described as euro-pop... It's fun, a little weird. The chorus is really fun, although this isn't my favorite song on here... it's still worth a listen.    7. The Fame - This song is very fun. It's kind of funny... when you think about the lyrics and how some people really think this way. I almost think she might be poking fun at some people for being so obsessed with fame, but maybe she just feels that way too... Who knows? It's fun.    8. Money Honey - Okay. I LOVE this song. It is already one of my favorites. They just played this song on Gossip Girl as well (you should watch that show if you don't). The song is so fun to sing along to (a thing I look for in songs in case you can't tell). It's also a little techno. Her voice sounds really good here too.    9. Starstruck - This song has a different sound than anything you here on the radio or anywhere else really. It's pretty funky. It has some computer stuff going on with her voice. It's definitely a club tune. Gets in your head, but not in a bad way. Has a rap verse in there, which is different from the rest of the album.    10. Boys, Boys, Boys - Really catchy. It's generally not about her lyrics, just how she sings them. This song reminds me of something... maybe an 80s song or something... Really fun... I could also hear this in the club.    11. Paper Gangsta - Once again, not about the lyrics--just how she sings them. I'm not sure what this song is about... almost sounds like it's about a pre-nup or something... I don't know. It's hard to say as she seems kind of random sometimes with her lyrics. It has a good sound regardless. Not as club-sounding, but still pretty upbeat.    12. Brown Eyes - Slower song. Most of the songs are fast--in fact, I think this is the only slower one. It's kind of different, but her voice sounds good. It's a pretty simple song. The song almost reminds me of some retro rock. Some people dislike it I think because it's slower, and most of her stuff is dance, club music. Give it a listen before you dimiss it though.    13. I Like It Rough - Definitely has a club beat to it, but is a little more subdued than other songs on here. The song seems to be about being mistreated in a relationship, but going back for more anyway. Really catchy. It's becoming one of my favorites (I only got the cd yesterday, but put it on my iPod immediately).    14. Summerboy - A good one, but doesn't stick in my head like the other ones do. She reminds me of Gwen Stefani initially in this song. Almost seems retro, but still very upbeat. Fun lyrics. Fun theme.     So, this is a cd that is very fun and upbeat. It's all about having fun. It's one of those cds you blast in your car, listen to at the gym, or dance and sing along to with your girlfriends at the club. If you're looking for something deep, this is not it. But if you want some fun spring/summer music to have fun to, this is it! Like I said, I was apprehensive at first, but can't stop listening to it! Also, as someone pointed out in another review, the lyrics are kind of strange at times, but it's more about how she sings it than what she's actually saying at times (and I'm a lyric girl).
0307387178|5.0|The book came on schedule and was in fantastic condition. Good experience working with this seller.
0374139563|1.0|Ms Moyo's book has some interesting ideas. However the facts don't agree with her, a fact that she's conveniently decided to ignore. She lumps together a complicated and nuanced history of millions of people over 50 years into a single bin. She then uses questionable statistics to provide evidence for her claims.    She conflates some issues with admittedly faulty implementations of aid with a fundamental problem with the idea of aid. In recent years aid has become more effective and is the only life lines for millions of Africans who would otherwise die of disease and starvation.     Nobody wants a dependent Africa that must beg for table scraps. However pulling aid will quite literally kill huge numbers of people in the name of ideology. Aid is a key part of turning Africa into an independent, prosperous continent. Until that time comes the bridge it provides should not be destroyed.
B001PP9STS|5.0|Salvo's 2009 enhanced CD reissue of The Undertones wonderful debut album (30th Anniversary) differs from last year's Sanctuary reissue of the same in a few ways worth pointing out.<br /><br />Here's a detailed breakdown (67:38 minutes - it's a single disc and not 2):<br /><br />Tracks 1 to 14 make up the 1st pressing of their debut LP \\"The Undertones\\" on Sire Records SRK 6071 initially released in May 1979 in the UK - January 1980 on Sire Records SRK-6081 in the USA. (The 14th track, the 50-second long \\"Casbah Rock\\" at the end of Side 2 is listed on the label, but not on the album sleeve). The original sleeve was a black and white photo (as shown above) with a distinctive red die-cut inner sleeve - the reissue (explained below) had colour artwork with a black inner sleeve (the USA original used the colour artwork version). The album was recorded at Eden Studios in Acton in London in January 1979 and produced by ROGER BECHIRIAN.<br /><br />Cashing in on the huge renewed response to their anthem \\"Teenage Kicks\\" - the album was reissued a second time in the UK as Sire Records SRK 6081 in November 1979 with a different front and inner sleeve and 2 added singles. \\"Teenage Kicks\\" was slipped in as Track 5 on Side 1 inbetween \\"I Gotta Get\\" and \\"Wrong Way\\", while the 2nd single  \\"Get Over You\\" was added on as the 1st Track on Side 2 - making a 16-song version of the LP. The Sanctuary issue of 2008 uses the 16-track line-up rather than the original 14. Of course with a little bit of number programming, the new Salvo issue allows you to program either.<br /><br />Tracks 15 to 18 are the full 4 songs of their debut \\"Teenage Kicks\\" EP issued on the privately pressed Good Vibrations Label (GOT 4) in September 1978 - produced by the band themselves. None of the songs turned up on the debut LP and it has remained a highly sought-after and collectable vinyl piece ever since. (This CD actually mistakes the track order - it should read - A1 is \\"Teenage Kicks\\", A2 is \\"Smarter Than You', B1 is \\"True Confessions\\", B2 is \\"Emergency Cases\\")<br /><br />Tracks 19 to 21 are the 3 tracks of their 2nd maxi single \\"Get Over You\\" issued on Sire Records SIR 4010 in January 1979 in the UK. \\"Really Really\\" and \\"She Can Only Say No\\" are the B-sides and again all 3 songs were non-album.<br /><br />Tracks 22 to 24 are their 4th UK single \\"Here Comes The Summer\\" b/w \\"One Way Love\\" and \\"Top Twenty\\". It was another maxi release, however, the 'single version' on the A-side differs to the version than ended Side 1 of the LP while the 2 B-sides were again non-album.<br /><br />Track 25, \\"Mars Bars\\", is the non-album B-side to their 3rd UK 7\\" single \\"Jimmy Jimmy\\" issued on Sire Records SIR 4015 in April 1979 (on lime green vinyl).<br /><br />Tracks 26 and 27, \\"You've Got My Number (Why Don't You Use It)\\" b/w \\"Let's Talk About Girls\\", are also non-album tracks - their 5th UK 7\\" single on Sire Records SIR 4024 issued in September 1979 in the UK.<br /><br />Tracks 29 to 31 are live John Peel Sessions recorded for the BBC at the Phoenix Studios on 7 May 1979<br /><br />Track 32 is a video track from 1978 of \\"Teenage Kicks\\" (filmed in Primrose Hill in London)<br /><br />As you can see, this new Salvo issue (SalvoCD017) has 31 audio tracks plus 1 video track tagged on at the end - the 2008 Sanctuary issue of last year has only 26 audio tracks.  There's also a new card wrap outside the jewel case using the original LP artwork, a 20-page booklet which pictures ticket stubs, buttons, 7\\" sleeves and band photos - and there's detailed and witty liner notes by their bass player MICHAEL BRADLEY. The remastering has been done by ANDY PIERCE at Masterpiece and is fantastically clear, really clean and in your face. As a downside, it would have been nice to hear more from either their great frontman and singer FEARGAL SHARKEY or especially JOHN O'NEILL - the band's principal songwriter.<br /><br />While the album itself is a blast, what puts this issue into the stellar is the truly brilliant 17 extra tracks - stunning power-pop B-sides like \\"One Way Love\\" and \\"Let's Talk About Girls\\". And the four Peel Sessions tracks allow you to hear just how piss'n'vinegar they really were as a live act (I wish I'd seen them).<br /><br />And then of course there's 'that' song - every time I hear The Undertones blistering debut 45 \\"Teenage Kicks\\", I can't help but think of the much-loved and sadly missed champion of Punk and New Wave music - the British DJ and Presenter JOHN PEEL. He adored the band with a passion and the hand-written lyrics to \\"Teenage Kicks\\" are framed in his home and literally etched above his final resting place (he was the first to air the song in September 1978). Ten seconds into its thrashing riff it's easy to know why - it's thrilling - it's ballsy - it's life itself - and it's as fresh now as is was back then - a full 30 years ago.<br /><br />Derry's finest are held in huge affection by so many music lovers and not without reason. I loved returning to this album, I really did.<br /><br />\\"I wanna hold her, wanna hold her tight...get teenage kicks right through the night...\\" Too Goddamn right!Girls\\".

1416972242|5.0|Do not buy the Kindle Version.  It is actually City of Glass even though it says City of Ashes.  The prologe is the City of Ashes, but the chapters are actually City of Glass.  I know because I bought both books on the Kindle and noticed the error.  I then bought the sample of City of Ashes and it is the same thing.  The right prologe wrong chapters.  I don't know if they even have a Kindle version of City of Ashes.  If you read the first chapter by mistake it will be a major spoiler for City of Ashes!!!
0807014273|5.0|This is one of those books that once you start reading you don't want to put it down.  It is inspirational from cover to cover.  The descriptions of events will paint a clear picture for anyone. This book will really get you thinking about all aspects of your life.  Frankl does a marvelous job providing specific examples for every important point of \\"logotherapy\\" he wants his readers to fully comprehend.    Frankl talks about his experience in the Nazi concentration camp Auschwitz. The description of the dichotomy of man is amazing yet simplistic.  To understand that MAN created such an evil thing like a gas chamber, yet no matter how horrible the situation is, MAN always has the freedom to choose how he will react.  This freedom can never be taken away, even in the darkest of places...Frankl lived to tell about it.
B001MYIXAC|5.0|As others have noted, this version does not contain the actually theatrical subtitles that everyone has gotten so angry about. HOWEVER, Magnet Releasing has agreed to release the theatrical subtitles once all the current inventory is gone. So I suggest you wait to buy it when it is available or  download it.     You will know if the DVD contains the theatrical subtitles by looking at the lower left hand corner of the DVD where it should say \\"Subtitles: ENGLISH (Theatrical).\\"
B001PJRAUS|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this series, but its charms are probably best appreciated by Austen fans with a working knowledge of the Pride and Prejudice story. A lot of the fun of the series is seeing how the P & P plot is derailed when Elizabeth Bennett exits and modern-day Austen fan Amanda Price enters the 19th century world of Austen's novel. Although I am an ardent admirer of Colin Firth's Darcy, I think that Elliot Cowan acquits himself well in the role, and Jemima Rooper brings the right combination of insouciance and insecurity to her modern, fish-out-of-water heroine. At times, the execution is uneven. Amanda is often unnecessarily clumsy in her attempts to influence the other characters, and some of the resolutions seem contrived. Overall, though, I thought the series was ingenious and I was kept in suspense to the very end wondering how Amanda and Elizabeth would \\"fix\\" the perverted plot.
B001TH16DI|1.0|I agree with most of the reviewers here.  No restoration, no directors cut equals big disappointment.  Paramount is sitting on a gold mine with this franchise but it has been so badly mis-managed.
B00243TXTU|1.0|I've had the V2 for only four months and suddenly the tens digit on the distance read-out is only displaying half of the LCD character for the number. For distances under 100 yards it's impossible to guess the range.  A new battery doesn't resolve this problem.  Very poor quality for a company like this.

B001P9KR94|4.0|When a release in Blu-ray  is done right it can literally take your breath away. When however a movie is hurried into release because it has won an Oscar for Best Picture the Blu-ray version is just a more expensive version of the regular DVD.     This should have been a movie as cinematically brilliant as it plot, acting and directing. The slums of Mumbai, the Taj Majal, high-rise cityscapes of a new Asian superpower, the Indian countryside should produce jaw-dropping awe when displayed in Blu-ray. It didn't happen. While good Blu-ray will often surpass the theatrical release and make you feel as if you are sitting beside the camera operator wearing great headphones, this movie felt like you were watching a decent movie on television.    Now the movie itself deserved an Oscar. In essence it is an Indian fairy tale of a young man's rise from the horrors of the slums to a menial but honest job supporting telemarketers in Indian call centers to 15 minutes of fame and millions of rupees on a game show. Simply put, it is brilliant. It's a pity that this Blu-ray release wasn't.

B001L51RQE|5.0|I was at that time in Bs. As. and saw this show... It was amazing. Now we can re-live this unique moment with this DVD. I recommend you to buy the 2 DVD + 2 CD version.  It is clear that Sting is a very \\"special\\" member of the band.
0307450570|4.0|While this book is indeed vast, it is by no means an encyclopedia, even by Martha's standards.  Martha even says in the introduction that she had, long ago, hoped for a collection of books on different subjects.  That idea, however, became \\"the ubiquitous Martha Stewart Living magazine.\\"  Interestingly, though, a book devoted to each subject would have been better defined by the \\"encyclopedia\\" moniker than this book.      Still, the photography,writing, and organization are of the high quality that we've all come to expect from MSLO, and the book will, for the most part, not disappoint.

B001R4MEYI|5.0|this album blew my balls off. Mastodon has changed more with this album than they have in between any of their others. as a whole the album is more conventional than their previous work, but they haven't dulled in any way. they've simply amped up the singing, toned down the screaming and taken a more sane approach to the music (but Blood Mountain is alive and kicking in The Last Baron). the middle lulls a bit, but the album is redeemed by some truly spectacular songs. The Last Baron is one of the best rock songs of the decade. as one would expect from Mastodon, this album kind of makes me want to wrestle a bear and go hunting for great white sharks in the great barrier reef with nothing more than my bare hands and my wits.
0783230079|5.0|I love this movie. It's a love story with a twist.  it's not only about finding and holding on to love, but also about friendships and assisting the ones you love to resolve their lives.  it is funny and amazing at the same time. I highly recommend it.

B000268QB2|5.0|There aren't many CD's I can say this about but I can listen to this front to back over and over.  It's my favorite Keane CD, by far.  She Has No Time is one of my favorite songs of all time.  Tears me up every time I hear it.
0307387178|3.0|Come on, people!  A tragedy, yes, but tell me what's so original about this story?<br /><br />There are so many reviews out there for this book that I'm going to make mine short and direct.<br /><br />The author has a lovely narrative style, and he tells this story skillfully.  His personal identification with McCandless is immediately apparent, and he tries his best to make McCandless seem like something original.  There's just one problem:  This story is nothing new.  It's archetypal.  Maybe that's what makes it so important.  What do we do in an age of destructive technology?<br /><br />American (and world) history is full of idealistic characters who become alienated from the \\"masses\\" and seek clarity on walkabout, often staring death in the face.  From the Indigo Girls to Dostoevskii, from Jeffers to Nietzsche, from Richard Henry Dana to Jesus, from Tom Sawyer to Thoreau, from Wittgenstein to Gandhi, Tori Amos, Rilke, Lenin, etc...  this story is well-trodden soil.  So what is it that makes McCandless so special?  That he wanted to be an ascetic?  That he wanted to be a modern-day Origen?  A Martyr?  That he wanted to be left the f--k alone?  Yes.  Tyson's Corner, Virginia needs to come to that realization as well.<br /><br />OK, so it's nothing special, really, in the context of world history, but it's something new for American history.  I would suggest that this book speaks to the alienated explorer in all of us.  It's appeal is in its accessibility, and the fact that we can relate easily to it.  After all, McCandless just seems so much like an \\"ordinary kid\\", right?  That's because he was.  Anybody remember Kurt Cobain?  The Ubermensch is alive and well, so what's the point of martyrdom in search of it?  Cobain didn't leave us many clues, but Chris McCandless does.

B000JML7EC|5.0|My mother read this book to me when I was much younger, so after receiving a Kindle for Christmas, I found this book and downloaded it.<br /><br />I forgot about the action and adventure that took place for the original \\"Pirates of the Caribbean\\" This is a fantastic read and well worth the cost (HA)  Treasure Island should be a book everyone reads at least once and has in the library to share with kids and grand kids.
B00006JMQG|4.0|The Expressionist sets in this movie really surprised me. Their off-kilter angles and surreal geometries create a suitably dream-like environment for the somnambulist nightmare to take place in. Those wild shapes certainly set the stage appropriately for this unusual movie, but figuratively set the stage for many later innovations in scenery design, as well. The ending, too, has an ambiguity that I didn't expect.<br /><br />The version of Caligari that I saw wasn't the best restored. That, however, worked to my advantage this time. Between uncertain contrast in places and varying light levels, I suddenly realized why actors in the silent classics tended toward stark styles of makeup - it helped keep their facial expressions legible despite the erratic photography of the time.<br /><br />Too many of its descendants have done too much more with movie-making for me to appreciate Caligari as its original audiences did, ninety years ago. In fact, many later movies surpassed Caligari by learning from it. Instead, I watched this as an historical artifact, the originator of ideas that have been developed since. That I found very enjoyable, and I'm grateful that this remarkable movie has survived to the current day.<br /><br />-- wiredweird
B001W63DY6|5.0|I bought this recently from Amazon UK since I did not want to wait till June. The concert is amazing. The high def of Blu-Ray is awesome!! The only thing I have to comment on is that I believe some of the big notes have been doctored to make Barbra sound better. Having owned the CD of the same concert for two years now I am quite aware of the fact that this concert doesn't show Barbra in the best voice of her career. To give her credit she is 65, and Barbra Streisand on a bad day is still better than most other singers out there.     The DVD version seems to have the flaws corrected. Don't get me wrong, I like this. But at the end of \\"Somewhere\\" during the big last note, Barbra's microphone is nowhere near her mouth and she's still in mid-note. Definitely embelished. But like I said, it's probably 98% undoctored. And I'd definitely recommend it to any Barbra fan.
B000001GBJ|5.0|Heaven-sent music! When listened to on a systematic basis, this CD can be a valuable vehicle for meditation and self-induced hypnotic trances. Try it on your way to find your own secret garden. But before you attempt self-hypnosis, make sure your heart's intentions are pure.

B001P9KR94|5.0|Slumdog millonaire really shines on blu ray.  It has 12 deleted scenes and several other bonus features that some dvd pressings did not have evidently.  You have 156 people mostly telling you that this is a great movie, and are they all correct? Absolutely , this is a great movie that has strong characters and is easy enough to follow even though the story jumps from the police station to the game show and back into the past of the main character. This seems confusing but it's not at all. The story is a solid story of the terrible conditions the poor are facing in the hugely overpopulated democratic country of India.  The picture deeerved it's best picture oscar because it tells it's story well , and it is as well acted as any A budget movie made anywhere else in the world.  This isn't bollywood though; a type of movie which had musical numbers thrown into the middle of it and which has it's place in world cinema; this is straight forward filmaking with solid direction and a more western style of storytelling.  Which is why it holds up well against the many other great movies made in the last 100 years and rightly joins them as a top effort in film.  The story of a slumdog orphan escaping poverty and by strange coincidences having his life mirror the questions on the Indian version of \\"Who wants to be a millionaire!\\".  The actor who plays the host of the show also creates a  very engaging and interesting character. He is all about himself yet not a villian and he certainly doesn't like to be reminded that he was once himself a slumdog.  The blu ray looks great and the sound is excellent. This is the reason to buy a blu ray player so that you can see movies they way they looked largely at the movie theater and this disc comes close to that.  So go blu ray and you won't regret it.

B001R7IHA0|5.0|I downloaded this CD as soon as it became available and the next day went out and bought a second copy for my car because I just can't stop listening to it! It's very upbeat and very Keith Urban. I honestly love every song on it, but my two favorites are probably My Heart Is Open and Til Summer Comes Around. Total opposites lyrically and musically but both amazing! I think Keith will have great radio success with this CD.  Get it - you won't be sorry!

031606792X|5.0|I'm absolutely ecstatic with the way Stephanie Meyer went about ending the Twilight series.  My emotions were completely tied up with each book in the series - feeling like a school girl in love during Twilight, being absolutely heartbroken right there with Bella in New Moon, still mad at Edward for ever leaving during Eclipse, and now happy, content, and satisfied with Breaking Dawn.    A lot of readers are complaining that there was little character development and no \\"sacrifices\\" were made for any of the characters' happiness.  What is so wrong with a happy ending, and who says there *has* to be sacrifice?  Honestly, I don't think my emotions could have taken it if the ending *wasn't* happy (ask my husband how moody I've been since I started reading the series).      While I agree that towards the end of Breaking Dawn the characters began to lose their voices somewhat, I think this was intentionally done to show that it was no longer about just Bella, Edward, and Jacob separately.  It became about family and putting them first.  No need for as much self indulgence and introspection about romantic love.  I was happy to see the characters mature in this way.     I loved all the plot twists and all the action (including all the hot action between Bella and Edward!).  I was super happy that Bella became a totally awesome & tough vamp lady.  Who doesn't want it all, including sexiness, grace, and power!?!  Loved the fantasy of it all.  This series was a really fun and frivolous escape from reality.  I enjoyed it immensely!
1439136653|1.0|Just like what I assume includes hundreds or thousands of other people, I saw Slumdog Millionaire, loved it, and decided to read the book that it was based on.  My wife and I enjoy reading together, so we borrowed the book from the library and I read the first four chapters to her.  The movie seemed creative and had many different stories that Jamal (Ram) recounted.  So far, the book's author seems concerned with only one general theme: pedophelia (usually homosexual).  Here's a brief summary of the first four chapters:    Chapter 1-A character's favorite action movie hero disguises himself as an old man, sits next to the character at a movie theater showing the star's movie, and gropes the young boy's crotch.    Chapter 2-The main character lives with a priest, and learns that another priest is having rampant homosexual sex, possibly with young boys.    Chapter 3-The main character lives next door to a family that includes a father who tries to rape his daughter.    Chapter 4-The main character lives in an orphanage in which a staff member invites young boys to his room in order to rape them every night.      I cannot conceive how anyone could enjoy reading this book, especially after seeing the movie.  I realize that rape is a terrible thing that very well may have shaped the character's view of the world, but it seems like Vikas Swarup could have used his imagination a little bit more.     It probably didn't help that our last book was \\"The Brothers Karamazov\\" by Fyodor Dostoevsky.  Compared to Dostoevsky, this book seems like a third grader could have written it.    What a disappointment.
0061122416|4.0|Your approach to this book will determine your love or distaste for it. I started reading it as a novel and found so much forced symbolism in the first paragraph alone that I was going to stop then and there. Luckily I didn't, for this story proved to be extremely worthwhile.  If you read this as a parable or a fable, and accept it as such from the beginning, you will enjoy this tale which has plotlines and situations that are original and unforgettable.
B0015DYIH2|2.0|As a mother of young adults myself and a reader of mostly romance and horror, I usually sit back and wait for one or all of my kids to read the books and tell me how good or bad the \\"best-selling\\" hyped up young adult books \\"REALLY\\" are before I run out and plunk down my hard earned cash. Regretfully, I did not listen to my 21 year old daughter when she warned me off of this one. Live and learn.    I truly loved the first book....found it to be one of the best books I've read in a very long time. I then downloaded the kindle versions of the next three books and read them in two days. The second and third installments were equally as good as the first. I absolutely fell in love with several of the characters in this series, especially Jacob.  And could hardly wait to see where this story took him in the final installment.  AND then I read Breaking Dawn.... to say I was let down would be the understatement of the year!    What was Meyers thinking when she wrote the 4th book? As a long time fan of the paranormal genre, I tend to steer clear of books that take extreme liberties with vampire lore and legend to the degree that Meyers did with this series.  But her characters were so engaging that I found myself somehow able to look past the fact that they walked around in daylight, sparkled (huh??) in the sun, had 'marble-like' skin, felt like stone and were all so perfect and beautiful.  However, when the author threw into the mix a mutant half-breed baby, brought back Jacob and had him imprint on the little troll who turned him into a glorified pet and then had everyone in their creepy dis-functional 'family' live happily ever after that was way more than I could stomach.    What a waste of money and time. I was so very let down and disgusted with the way this series ended that had I not been reading Breaking Dawn on my kindle I'd have trashed it altogether.

B0007Y89ZM|5.0|Hi, I've owned this DVD since it was released, and my wife and I still watch it at least, 2-3 times a month. I just wanted to share a part in the concert where my favorite song, LAST RESORT starts. If you watch Don on the stool in the beginning, he starts to get worried and his head turns back and forth, and suddenly there is a look of disgust on his face. If your system can pick it up, he is upset over a BUZZING noise, and it goes away. I thought it was priceless. I can feel for him. I know he's a perfectionist. With their music I would be too. One last thing, why couldn't somebody SHUT that guy UP!! in the audiance who was yelling ROCK and ROLL constantly. He should've gone to a Metallica head banger!! The Eagles 'ROCK' real well, without making ear bleeding noise. Their passion for their craft, and music is second to none. The adding of Joe Walsh in '76 gave them all the rock they needed. Thank Mr. Walsh for that influence.

0312380852|5.0|I just got my copy of this book and am going *WOW* on just about every page - as in WOW, that's gorgeous -- and, WOW, that actually looks pretty do-able!    Only problem is: which project to start first, they're all so appealing. [Update: ah, got one: definitely the *WOW* stained-glass bracelet on page 98, what a knock-out]    Full disclosure: I'm a friend of the author, whose work (and whose fabulous color sense)I've long admired. But I'm giving this book the full five stars because the production values are right up there with the quality and beauty of the designs. Instead of those boring black & white diagrams I see in other books of this type, here you get brilliant color photos showing every step clearly (good for keeping it real and for keeping up my motivation to go to the next step).

B000P7V45S|3.0|This review pertains to the DVD-A, not the music.  Despite being a \\"DVD\\", you can't play this on a DVD-A or DTS 5.1 player in a car.  I have an 2008 Acura with this system, and the DVD disk could not be played.  I was very disappointed, and felt a bit ripped off.  The DVD portion is for the video that comes on the same disk.  That sort of made-up for it.  You get an audio disk as well and the remix is better than the orginal CD release that I have from 1990.  So if you have a DVD audio player in your car, don't bother with this release.

B001FB55MG|3.0|It's about time. Eddie Murphy did it, so why not Adam Sandler? Disney's comedy \\"Bedtime Stories\\" stars Adam Sandler as Skeeter Bronson, a hotel maintenance man dreaming of becoming a hotel manager someday. Today, however, Skeeter must take care of his niece and nephew while their mother Wendy (Courtney Cox) is away from home looking for a new job. Skeeter then realizes that \\"bedtime stories\\" he and the two kids make up - Westerns, Roman chariot racing, etc. - all really come true next day in an unexpected fashion he can never predict.    Yes, it is a Disney film with the Walt Disney castle logo, which means \\"Bedtime Stories\\" is Adam Sandler's (first) family picture. \\"Bedtime Stories\\" has one good idea about \\"dreams come true,\\" but the film's storyline is largely predictable with stock characters like Skeeter's mean-spirited rival played by cast-against-type, intentionally hammy Guy Pierce, plus a wide-eyed lovely guinea pig. Sandler's easygoing Skeeter makes a nice contrast with Keri Russell's serious-minded Jill, but some of his fans may be disappointed with his toned-down performances and the good-natured, but harmless comedy.    Perhaps some of you will find the unique cast including Jonathan Pryce, Richard Griffiths, Russell Brand and Rob Schneider (and a cameo of one beloved character from \\"Toy Story\\") is more interesting than its weak subplot about Skeeter's promotion and love romance. Director Adam Shankman, who made terrific musical \\"Hairspray,\\" did a decent job, but all in all \\"Bedtime Stories\\" falls into the \\"could be better, could be worse\\" territory.
B001MEJY8W|1.0|AS AN ADDENDUM: My review contains some serious spoilers. Read at your own risk. I use the term \\"torture porn\\" not as a pejorative, but as a commonly accepted term used to describe films of this genre.  I'm not going to waste time here discussing the merits or value of the term.  I'm not a \\"professional\\" critic - nor do I have to be.  And I'm not trying to prove how hard I am by listing my repertoire of violent films watched.  The following is simply an unpretentious opinion, nothing more.<br /><br />The horror genre is my favorite film genre. I've been watching them since I'm a kid. I can remember seeing mainstream movies like \\"Halloween,\\" \\"Nightmare on Elm Street,\\" \\"Friday the 13th,\\" and a host of other more obscure films - some of which were thought of as extreme in their day. But after watching a number of \\"torture porn\\" films lately, I can safely say that I know I'm not desensitized to violence. Torture porn seems to be the nouveau chic, avant-garde subgenre of horror films lately, but these films really have very little to do with horror.  I shouldn't even call it a subgenre.  This is a mistake.  I follow many horror movie sites and magazines, all of which covered this film.  It has about as much in common as Poison does Slayer, if talking about metal bands.  To be honest, try as I may, I absolutely hate the genre! I like my horror films to have a story with a bit of violence thrown in. Torture porn has violence with a little bit of a story thrown in.... maybe... probably not...but just maybe.<br /><br />I was really looking forward to this film.  So to be fair and to develop an honest opinion, I actually watched all of this film, and I can honestly say it's the most repulsive film that I've ever seen. Seriously! I'm about as liberal as it comes with art, but I thought for the first time that I was watching something that borderlined the obscene. It was really that grotesque - and not in the fun way. For the only the second time in my 35 years, I felt truly disgusted and sickened by a film - the other during the rape scene in \\"The Last House on the Left \\" remake (during which time I never heard an audience get so quiet... I suspect they were all shocked, too).  I've since seen other shocking films, too, but my opinion of this film still stands.<br /><br />The movie spends the vast majority of the time shocking the user first with extreme violence and then endless amounts of torture, only to throw in a Shyamalan-esque ending at the very end.  To me, it did nothing to redeem the film, which spent too much time on the torture and violence.  \\"High Tension\\" did the same thing.  There's a formula here apparently:  throw in as much extreme violence as possible, and at the end, give the viewers a twist as a chaser.  I thought \\"High Tension\\" was bit cleverer with this, but after watching a woman get tortured for so long in this film and so graphically, the ending failed to outshine what had preceded it.  I've seen other films that used the violence as a plot element.  In this genre, it has become the main element.  It's the centerpiece, and makes all other element seem ancillary.<br /><br />I have a hard time seeing the artistic value of movies like this. It may be there (I'll give it that much), but I just don't see it.  I'm of the opinion that the violence simply overpowers the movie's story. It's a subtle as a sledge hammer to the face. It's so shocking that people talk more about the violence of the film than its story, which, I think, shows the holes in the argument that the violence helps to move the plot along. What ever happened to subtlety in films? Apparently we all have the attention spans of 2 years olds and have to be constantly shocked into paying attention. The ending didn't leave me with any epiphany. I thought...wow...the violence is finally over....roll the credits....get me back the horror of the real world!  There' s nothing life-affirming, enlightening, or beautiful about \\"Martyrs\\" that hasn't been said elsewhere in more eloquent ways - either in print or film.  Making excuses for the gratuitous amounts of violence seems to be a poor attempt at rationalizing.<br /><br />SPOILERS BELOW!!!<br />\\"Martyrs\\" has a bit of a plot, one that is placed in between the blood, cutting, beating of women, flaying people alive, force feeding people, etc. The plot is this, and only this: a cult believes that martyrdom is possible outside of religious belief and that a person can have visions of the afterlife if they suffer martyrdom. That's it. Period! A cult that wants to know what's after death tortures people to the point of martyrdom to find out what's after death. This might sound like a cool idea, but it is overpowered by the extreme level of violence of the film, which is so incredibly realistic that it's amazing! The French have a knack for producing the most realistic and bloody torture porn films - for good or for ill.<br /><br />I've seen plenty of real life violence and bloodshed, so I'm not of a delicate disposition.  I just honestly don't see the appeal of the genre. To me, it is a proof of the law of diminishing returns. People are constantly looking for new kicks. Surrounded daily by real horrors, people are no longer scared by traditional horror films. In comes torture porn to fill the need and to push the limits. It's S&M film, taken to deadly and grotesque limits. To me, there's nothing scary about seeing someone skinned, repeatedly beaten, force-fed, or cut over and over - especially women. To me, \\"SAW\\" started the modern incarnation of this genre (I liked that film, btw), and now people are trying to outdo each other with the level of gore and shocking violence. I expect more than violence in my horror films. Maybe this is your film; it wasn't mine. I'm sure it will appeal to fans of \\"Salo\\" and other examples of cultural detritus - although I think this film has more in common with \\"Saw\\" than \\"Salo.\\"  I don't see the art in any of these films. Would people say the same thing about, let's say, a realistic depiction of death camps, one that shows everything from internment to the actual mass murder? What's next a torture porn movie about Mengele?  Instead of capturing the terror of horror films and distilling it into its most primal form, it looses its focus and produces a film that stands solely on the broken legs of extreme gore and violence without having a soul (a sound plot).<br /><br />These films are pushing the bounds of hard ratings.  At the rate that they are going, I suspect they'll be in the 18-only section before too long.  These films are utterly doomed to serve a niche market, if not fail altogether.  I think it's safe to say that the vast majority of people, even horror fans, don't want to be traumatized by what they see.  Horror is great because it's fantasy, it's not real.  It provides escapism, a little bit of fear, some excitement, maybe even some humor.  But films that provide true repulsion, the totally grotesque, and even the vile stand as stark contrasts.  They blur the line between entertainment, which is what horror is, and just plain disturbing imagery.  Try as I might, I have a hard time seeing the beauty in violence for violence sake, in any medium.  It's too real and too disturbing.  I feel like I'm strapped into a chair undergoing the \\"Ludovico Technique.\\"ther in print or film.

B00000J7JO|5.0|I'm truly a hip-hop/R&B/reggae fan, but something about this album gets me pumped!  Love it!!!
B000ASATZ8|4.0|This was fun.  Especially #4, which was a prequel.  Great bargain for the price.
0765342294|3.0|On a recommendation from a friend, I found this book in my neighborhood paperback exchange. By all evidence of the physical object, I went into the read cautiously, as it seemed to resemble any of the dozens of pulp sci-fi novels surrounding it.     The writing was, in fact, nothing particularly special. It was, as expected, a fast-moving, simple and rather un-nuanced writing style. There were no big surprises, and read like a pulp novel.     That's the extent of the criticism, though. Although as literature Ender's Game was lacking, the story and the characters were all brilliantly captured and relayed.     Card did a spectacular job capturing the psychology and the complexity of the interplay of individuals with one another, with their society, and with the institutions forming their realities.     Though it did not exceed a simplistic telling of a tale, the subjects and characters were so wonderfully captured that Ender's Game was a complete joy to read, and bore an intellectual payload far overshadowing the writing itself.
B001K3JF7K|3.0|As the owner of a number of prior Diana Krall albums I can be counted as one of her fans. This latest effort has lush arrangements by the great Claus Ogerman, first-class musicians (including Diana on piano), and a fine selection of songs, especially those of Brazilian origin. But Ms Krall's song renditions lack spirit and her voice sounds ... tired. I noticed this watching the broadcast of her performance at the White House in late February of this year as part of the Stevie Wonder tribute. The clarity of tone and honeyed cadences we've come to expect are missing here, and I hope this is just temporary. Meanwhile, I would recommend just watching the lovely video for \\"Quiet Nights\\" in which Diana's singing and the romantic arrangement and beautiful shots of Rio all meld nicely. But pass on this CD unless you're such a devoted fan you can overlook the vocal shortcomings.
B0009UC810|5.0|EXCELLENT! Excellent! Excellent! Excellent!
B0007PLLQ0|1.0|I purchased this video, after reading about its features, thinking it was the \\"original cut, not the directors cut.  I am displeased with the video only because I was sent the directors cut vs the original score, which I may add that the directors cut has a totally different musical score thoughout the entire movie (which I do not like), many extra scenes and cut scenes from the original movie release.  There was \\"no\\" mention on the web page that this was a directors cut, thus I feel ripped off.  This is a great film for me in its original format, but very poor in the directors cut.  The company that sold it probably just wanted to get rid of these extra directors cut videos, and did not tell the truth about the movie format just to get them out of the store.  VERY DISPLEASED WITH THIS PURCHASE
0307450570|5.0|WHAT A GREAT BOOK!  Chock full of ideas. Great graphics. Easy to read and easy to follow.
0316067598|5.0|A great, fast read.  This book made me appreciate what our folks in the military do day in and day out for us without asking for anything special in return.  Also gives you great insight into how the media has changed the ways wars are fought, for the worse in my opinion.  We need to hear more stories like this.
B001P9KR8U|4.0|In these tough times, I applaud Fox for thinking outside the box.  I think the rental vs. final purchase copy is a brilliant idea.<br /><br />I don't mind getting my disc exchanged.  At least they fessed up and let us know RIGHT AWAY that there was an issue.  Most of us have already seen the film - and are wanting to BUY it because it is a PHENOMENAL piece of art.<br /><br />I encourage EVERYONE here to purchase this legacy masterpiece.  I intend on getting more copies for family members and dear friends.  It will make a wonderful gift.<br /><br />Good going, Fox.  No worries.  I still love your movies and TV shows.  You have a loyal customers in me and many others here.
0399230033|5.0|The zoo keeper makes a round before closing the zoo and says \\"Good night\\" to all the animals not knowing the gorilla snatched his key and follows behind and releases all the animals.<br />This is a great bed-time book and as the child says good night to the animal with you, I think it mentally prepares them for bed. The simple illustration is pleasurable to look at and the reciting of the animal names also makes it a good educational tool.<br />It is one of our definite favorites to read before turning out the light.
B001P9KR8U|4.0|Movie goers love a film where the hero triumphs over the most adverse conditions to attain a goal. And this goes back further than the pinnacle of this genre, ROCKY. So what did the voters of the Academy do this year when it came to an Oscar winner for best film? They picked SLUMDOG MILLIONAIRE.<br /><br />This movie features the most improved character when it comes to tough times. The major plot of the film is actually quite simple. A young man goes on TV in India for a WHO WANTS TO BE A MILLIONAIR show. His goal is to make enough to find the girl of his dreams and settle down with her. That's it. And yet, that's not all there is to it.<br /><br />The film uses a combination of present day situations combined with well executed flashbacks to show just how fortunate he is on the show. Each and every question asked of him is something he has learned through the rough and tumble times of his life. And troubled times they were.<br /><br />As the film opens our hero, Jamal Malik (Dev Patel) is being interrogated by the police. His suspected crime is cheating on the game show he is winning. How could someone of his background, a dweller from the poorest community in Mumbai (thus the Slumdog portion of the title), possible know the answers to these questions? As he is questioned, he provides the police chief as well as the viewers of the story of his life and how he came to know them.<br /><br />As a small child Jamal and his brother Salim play amid fields of garbage while living with their mother. A riot involving the Muslim and non-Muslim factions leads to their mother's murder and their quickly becoming orphans. Along with a young girl they meet named Latika, they live off the street until they are rescued by a missionary who collects young orphans.<br /><br />But this is no real missionary as it turns out he uses the small children to scam people on the street into giving them money. He collects it all. He even goes so far as to blind those that can sing so they will make more money. With a little luck, Salim, Jamal and Latika escape, only to have Latika captured before they can get away.<br /><br />Jamal is infatuated with Latika and his search for her spurs the romantic side of the story. He and his brother search for her until the day she is found. But this leads to more tragedy as Salim gets a gun and becomes a young gangster involved with crooks in town. A break between brothers results in Latika and Jamal parting ways once more.<br /><br />More and more happens to Jamal and each experience shows his determination to find a better life as well as Latika. And while Jamal works hard, attempting to rise above his circumstances, Salim dives into the worst the world has to offer, making a living for himself but at what cost?<br /><br />The end result is Jamal's appearance on the game show where he has the chance to make more than he could have ever dreamed of. And with the money he has the chance to rescue Latika from the fate that befell her not only at the hands of Salim but of the local gangster head who has chosen her for his own.<br /><br />There are more scenes and difficulties than I've listed here, but better to see them for yourself. And the best part of this film was the slow unspooling of the tale, as Jamal recounts his life and how each part of it provided the answers he needed to win, The world through his eyes is one of hope, the eyes of Salim a despair. How two brothers can see the world differently makes up a major portion of the tale.<br /><br />All of the acting in the film is impressive not only for the professionals but for the children who play them in their youth as well. Chosen to play these parts were actual children from the area, the real slumdog children. Dev Patel as the adult Jamal has a future ahead of him granted he gets parts as good as this one.<br /><br />So was this the best film that came out last year? Good enough that it deserved the Oscar for best film? Yes, it is an exceptional film. ButI can think of others I enjoyed more. Then again I've rarely agreed with what the Academy chooses over the past few years. But if you enjoy good storytelling, then you'll want to make a point of watching this film. You won't be disappointed.Academy chooses over the past few years. But if you enjoy good storytelling, then you'll want to make a point of watching this film. You won't be disappointed.
B001PPF12Q|3.0|Five star record, three stars for the re-issue...  \\"Ok Computer\\" is a modern classic, definitely one the best records of all-time. This COLLECTOR'S EDITION collects the b-sides and live tracks from the album's singles, as well as 3 songs recorded for the BBC.   You know what you're getting with Disc 1- it is a standard re-issue of the album. The second disc, while compiling all of the non-album tracks, and thus giving a complete picture of Radiohead's \\"OK\\" output, still falls short of making this purchase necessary.  The live songs are nice, but really, don't add anything to this set, and the remixes, while interesting to hear \\"Climbing Up the Walls\\" in a different light, are not going to be listened to more than a handful of times. The best b-sides are already available on the \\"Airbag/ How's My Driving?\\" EP.  Buy that and the original \\"OK Computer\\" pressing (which combined shouldn't cost more than this), and you have all you really need if you are not a completist (who would probably have all of the original singles anyway, thus having no need for this set).
B001PPLIEG|4.0|The James Bond series has seen its ups and downs. While it has always been a money maker, it seemed like it was about to lose steam during the last of the Pierce Brosnan set. And then they decided on a new Bond, one that most fans weren't sure about. Think back to the surprise when Daniel Craig not only filled the shoes well but maybe better than Brosnan, the man fans clamored for.<br /><br />While CASINO ROYALE went on to become a huge hit, fans wondered whether or not the follow up would be. Well  QUANTUM OF SOLACE is as good as its predecessor...and its not.  It is definitely not the same film. But it still ranks as a dynamite action flick.<br /><br />The film takes place shortly after the end of the last one. Bond is literally on the road in the midst of a car chase among the hills of Italy with its winding highway along the edge of mountains on one side, cliffs dropping to the sea on the other. Between gunplay and tight squeezes he escapes the bad guys and brings a lead to the Quantum crime organization to M (Judi Dench) to be questioned.<br /><br />Too bad the captive lets them know they've been infiltrated and M's right hand man is one of them as her guard attempts to assassinate M and kills his man in the process. A fleet footed pursuit follows as Bond takes after the man with a rooftop battle that ends in a platform fist fight and the death of the traitor.<br /><br />With few leads to follow, Bond hits the road and discovers a young woman named Camille (Olga Kurylenko) he helps escape from death at the hands of her benefactor and Quantum agent Dominic Greene (Matthieu Almaric). Greene's front is that of a philanthropic eco-warrior with intentions of saving the world. In reality, his plans involve nothing more than taking advantage of those who want to save the world as well as their money.<br /><br />Bond's lead seems thin and as he ignores M's pleas to come in and debrief, he finds himself alone without the aid of the British Secret Service. Instead he relies on the help of an old friend he once put in prison, Rene Mathis (Giancarlo Giannini). The pair flies off to South America where they confront Greene.<br /><br />More leads, a few deaths and an accidental discovery of what Greene is truly attempting to do lead Bond to a secluded building in the dessert of Bolivia, a drought filled country in need of water where it seems Greene may have found oil. Enough so that the Americans in the form of the C.I.A. are ready to jump into bed with him and support the coupe he intends to sponsor.<br /><br />Only Bond can put a stop to the whole thing and with few people backing him one has to question if he can accomplish this feat. He...okay...come on. This is James Bond we're talking about here. Of course he wins!<br /><br />One major difference here is Bond's motivation. He's not just following orders here, indeed he's ignoring orders and going off on his own. What first seems like an act of vengeance for the death of Vesper from CASIONO, it seems that he's truly attempting to bring down Quantum single handedly as well as take out those who would attack M, his personal authority figure.<br /><br />The film is a genuine action film that holds your interests and also offers enough story to make you think as well. But it isn't CASINO ROYALE or any other Bond film. It's harder, edgier and Bond comes off less flippant and more determined. One thing that helps explain this is to discover that this film isn't meant to stand on its own. It's more of a direct follow up to ROYALE. The two films are meant to be seen together and when done that way make a much better viewing pleasure.<br /><br />So the best thing to do is take a Saturday or Sunday, make plenty of popcorn, fill the ice bucket and break out the 2 liter bottle and get ready. This is gonna be a long viewing experience but well worth it. And when it's over, you'll be sitting, wondering and waiting for the next Craig played Bond feature to be released.once put in prison, Rene Mathis (Giancarlo Giannini).

061891868X|4.0|the review, \\"unstrung\\" in \\"The New Yorker\\" (by Jim Holt, October 2, 2006) curiously concluded with some thoughts that had occurred independently to me. karl popper evidently \\"believed (that) there will prove to be no end to the succession of deeper and deeper theories.\\" the idea - basically repeated in the history of physics - had occurred to me that if string theory is ever completed, it will open our eyes so wide that eventually, we'll begin to notice problems with the theory itself, ultimately necessitating a \\"theory of everything we used to know, and then some.\\"     even if that turns out to be true, perhaps there will be only a finite \\"succession of deeper and deeper theories,\\" but at some point, \\"the next theory\\" simply may prove to be beyond even a group of 1000 newton, carnot, maxwell, lorentz, einstein, bohr, heisenberg, schrödinger, dirac, gell-mann, feynman, 't hooft, etc., clones: \\"Perhaps the most fundamental truth about nature is simply beyond the human intellect, the way that quantum mechanics is beyond the intellect of a dog.\\"     in george musser's book on string theory (a good \\"layman's\\" primer for this book), feynman was quoted as saying, \\"one thing that bothers me about physics, as it is understood today, is that an infinite number of logical operations, by any existing digital computer, would be required to understand what's going on in the tiniest bit of space.\\" turning that statement around, we should expect that this will not be the case with the \\"theory of everything\\" - it basically will be \\"computable.\\"     the final sentence of The New Yorker review bothers me, as feynman was bothered by the above:     \\"And, even if a final theory is found, it will leave the questions about nature that most concern us - how the brain gives rise to consciousness ... - untouched.\\"     during my freshman year, i developed a rather complete epistemology of my own, which is essentially positivistic. i was naive enough to think that nobody else had ever thoughtof that stuff before me (or perhaps i didn't even happen to wonder if anyone else had), but ultimately i concluded that consciousness is fundamentally beyond our understanding and explanation, because the only \\"tools\\" for understanding consciousness are the elements of consciousness, themselves. consequently, any \\"theory of consciousness\\" necessarily would be self-referential, and whatever logic that provided scaffolding for the theory, ultimately would be circular.     it seems to me that an honest-to-goodness \\"theory of everything\\" must also explain consciousness. however, if consciousness is fundamentally beyond human understanding, then so it would seem is this \\"ultimate theory of everything.\\"       for my part, overall, smolin wrote quite an interesting, informative, and thought provoking book. my impression is that the difference of opinion between him and joe polchinsky (as the \\"representative\\" of string theory) - that each tend to perceive the \\"opposing camp\\" of exaggerating their own successes, while having obvious biases against views they don't share - is a somewhat predictable consequence of each having a point of view that he strongly believes in ... and, of course, the fact that they strongly believe in differing points of view is basically due to the fact that they have differing judgments regarding physics, sociology, etc.     in \\"black holes & time warps,\\" thorne made a comment regarding the remarkable difference in the ways that 1st-order-approximation-similar people think, using himself & stephen hawking as an example. one of smolin's central theses, of course, is that given the complexity of present day theoretical physics, such differences in modes of thinking are, in fact, an indispensable resource.     polchinsky, presumably, doesn't fundamentally disagree, but simply believes that smolin overestimates the degree to which string theory's dominance limits the opportunities of those having very different ideas (as the early lack of respect forstring theory affected the opportunities of people like john schwartz, who ... after princeton put him out on the street ... likely spent 12 years as a research associate because feynman thought string theory was \\"crazy\\").     and presumably both would agree with the idea, and ideal, expressed by feynman: \\"Science is a way of trying not to fool yourself\\" ...     note the word, \\"trying\\" - if anyone had a crystal ball, he could easily avoid the possibility that the future may judge him a fool.       but that's too serious a way to end, following peter shor's review, above - without a doubt the funniest piece of \\"scientific humor\\" i've ever read! (obviously, i haven't spent the past quarter-century or so working on string theory.) however, he neglected to mention one key scam, as follows:     String theorists: \\"the theory you sold me yesterday was pregnant. it gave birth to 4 or 5 more theories, and they're spilling all over my neighbors' lawns!\\"     Nature: \\"no problemo! UPS just delivered a bunch of nice new dualities...\\"     String theorists: \\"what are those?\\"     Nature: \\"well, they're kind of like inverse fun-house mirrors. if you set them up in just the right way, you can make a whole bunch of theories look like just only one theory! if you hurry, your neighbors may not even notice that their lawns are covered in physics equations.\\"     String theorists: \\"ok, i'll take a set of dualities, too.\\"     Nature: \\"no problemo! and here's 5 more c-y manifolds, on the house!\\"       i guess we'll just have to wait for the einstein of the 21st century to come along & slash thru this great gordian knot ... maybe a \\"genetic marriage\\" of kip thone & stephen hawking (having 2 Y-chromosomes, and therefore really, really, super mathematical ability, and also lots & lots of facial & body hair) could pull it off.     did peter mention seers? i happen to be a seer, and i \\"see\\" that the final theory will be a quantum mechanical analogue of how to make bets with yourself, in such a way that in the long run, you come out a winner ... unfortunately, i'm not enough of a master craftsman to work out the details.
031606792X|5.0|Although I will not say it is the best book I've ever read, I will say it is the best book of the Twilight series. Much of the questions you've had before will be answered, but you'll have new questions which may not be answered =/
1594481938|5.0|Hornby has already proven his mastery of the male ego in High Fidelity and About a Boy. In A Long Way Down he tackles the often taboo topic of suicide and nails it! A Long Way Down is a work that is nearly impossible to create. At it's core it's a book centered around the issue of suicide and getting through life when life is absolutely miserable. However, the book is packed with realistic humor and is anything but depressing! Hornby also doesn't take the easy way out with any of his characters to create a \\"fairy tale\\" like book. It's real, entertaining and all together surprisingly uplifting! Read it!
B001O5LVPI|3.0|On March 24th Disney released Lilo & Stitch in a two disc \\"Big Wave\\" edition.  This eighty-five minute animated film was a huge success when it was released in June of 2002, and is still an interesting and visually exciting film, but this new release appears to be, well, stitched together.    Lilo & Stitch take the ET formula and turns it upside down as the aggressive and nearly indestructible genetic experiment 626 escapes his prison sentence, makes his way to Earth, and is adopted by the also aggressive Lilo, who loves her unusual looking dog.  Take the antics of the two main characters, throw in Lilos over extended guardian and older sister Nani, a mysteriously stern man in black social worker named Cobra Bubbles, and an alien comedy team sent to capture Stitch, put them all in the serene Hawaiian islands, and set all the action to some classic Elvis songs, and you have a film that children are sure to enjoy.    The film has some unusually violent tendencies for a Disney film, as Lilo is certainly not the standard Disney youngster.  She hits, bites, and talks back, but the film is about growth and change as both characters display a well crafted evolution in who they are and how they relate to their environment and those in it.  There are some good messages to be found in this film, though parents may need to break it down for children, as the story is a bit busy.    The vocal talents of Daveigh Chase and Tia Carrere, as Lilo and Nani do a wonderful job of capturing the local dialect, as does Jason Scott Lee as the local boy interested in Nani.  Writer and co-director Chris Sanders has fun with the sounds emanating from Stitch, and David Ogden Stiers, Ving Rhames, Kevin McDonald, and Kevin Michael Richardson round out a talented cast of vocal artists who bring great energy to this project.    It is the look and sound of the film that will endear it to adults.  The watercolors give this film a look that seems to combine the beauty of classic Disney animation withthe technology of today to create images that jump of the screen and settings that draw the viewer in.  The imagery is truly some of the best in the Disney vault, and it is hard to go wrong with a sound track full of Elvis songs.  The entire soundtrack is worth owning as it contains great rock and roll along with wonderful songs that are sure to transport you to the islands.    It's almost seven years since the film hit the big screen and eventual DVD release, an animated television series would follow the next year, and a straight to DVD sequel in 2005, so it had to be time for a new release.  Disney certainly had enough time to put together something really special, so why does the two disc \\"Big Wave\\" edition seem so thrown together?  From no information as to which pieces of material are on which disc, to repetitive content, games listed as samples that aren't, a ridiculously short hula lesson, and a painfully long documentary, this is a mess.    The reselling of a film on DVD is always about the bonus material, and there is certainly a lot here, but how about putting some effort into the presentation.  The second disk is an embarrassment.  It loads to an amateurish menu that leads to a documentary which follows the making of the film from inception to premiere, and is exhaustively thorough at over two hours.  If that is not enough, the second disk also includes footnotes from the documentary, and deleted scenes and early versions, though both features contain a lot of the same material.    The first disk contains the feature as well some pleasant and educational bonus features including audio commentary featuring producer Clark Spencer and directors/writers Chris Sanders and Dean DeBlois, DisneyPedia: Hawaii - The Islands of Aloha, and the theatrical trailers that creatively inserted Stitch into classic Disney films such as The Little Mermaid, Beauty and the Beast, The Lion King, and Aladdin.      Where as the documentary on the second disk was too long, some features on the first disc are far too short.  The Hula lesson will disappoint kids as it could have easily been a terrific piece by providing some quality instruction rather than the three minute glance that it is, \\"Burning Love\\" is nothing more than watching Wynonna standing in front of a microphone singing the song, and though \\"A Stitch in Time\\" is certainly long enough at three minutes, it makes little sense.     Recommendation: If you don't own the wonderfully edgy Lilo & Stitch, than this is a fine way to add it to your collection. If you do already own the DVD, and really want to know more about the film, there is some quality bonus material here, but the presentation certainly could have been better as could some of the content.
B000003TA4|5.0|This is where most Nirvana listeners start because it has the most hit singles and is most popular. And yes it is a great album but I dont think its the best one but if you're new to Nirvana then you should probably start here. Rating song by song:<br />1. Smells Like Teen Spirit (5/5)- It's a really good song, one of the best on here, very overplayed on t he radio but still one of the best<br />2. In Bloom (5/5)- Its extremely catchy and also has the tendency to wear out if you play it too much but its a good song<br />3. Come As You Are (5/5)- It has kind of a dark feeling to it, not as loud as Smells like teen Spirit but very catchy.<br />4. Breed 5/5- Now this song is very energetic and will punch you in the face with its fuzzed out guitar yet still manages to stick in your head<br />5. Lithium (5/5)- This song is very unique because its a very simple song yet it is very catchy and effective with relatively hard guitar under it.<br />6. Polly (5/5)- This is the simplest song on the album, just one acoustic guitar and a cymbal crash, and it is still very moving.<br />7. Territorial Pissings (5/5)- Now this song isnt for everyone but its fuzzed out punk rock at its finest but still manages to be somewhat catchy<br />8. Drain You (5/5)- a very poppy rock song with an odd breakdown in the middle that kind of keeps you in suspense.<br />9. Lounge Act (5/5)- Not a stand out track on the album but a really good one nonetheless (i did put 5 out of 5). It's catchy and becomes very raw and emotional at the end. Its amazing how the bass intro is so effective.<br />10. Stay Away (5/5)- This is also not a \\"standout\\" but a great song; alot of change-ups in the duration of the song and intense drumming.<br />11. On a Plain (5/5)- This one tends to be overlooked but is really good but its very catchy and kind of cheery haha. The harmonizing is VERY good, if you dont like it at first itll grow on you<br />12. Something In the Way 5/5- When I first heard this I got easily bored of it fast; but now i feel the intensity of it, even if the verses are sung repeatedly. The cellos in the background give it this haunting atmosphere. This will also grow on you<br /><br />This album is catchy pop rock meets fuzzed out hard rock. Simple as that.<br />Its a great combination and I dont understand the term grunge because how I put it is what it really is. Buy this album.ven if the verses are sung repeatedly.
