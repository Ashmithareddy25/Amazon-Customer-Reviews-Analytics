B000WCBMA8|5.0|Hi friends.  Above average Hives fan, keep that in mind.  It's 2007, folks.  People are downloading singles or buying albums designed to be full albums.  The Hives know this and give (as always) the biggest bang for the buck:  fourteen songs priced for EVERYONE to afford, which sound BEST all together, and in chronological order.  You have got the classic Hives songs for the familiar:  Tick Tick Boom, Try It Again, You Got It All... Wrong, Hey Little World, Won't Be Long, Return the Favour, Square One Here I Come, Bigger Hole to Fill.  Great, fast, upbeat songs.  Lots of places to sing along by the time you get to the second chorus, they are THAT catchy.  Guitars sound great, some wonderful piano accompanying songs, bass is deep and prominent.  The amount of excellent classic Hives songs on this album meets or exceeds the number of standout tracks on their other great CD's, so right off the bat, this CD is very satisfying.  I've asked other Hives-loving friends of mine how they feel for the album, and while we all have different favorite songs from the classic sounding tracks, we dig them all.  But here's where it becomes an album, the songs in between:  Well All Right! (zoot suit big band sound), A Stroll Though Hive Manor Corridors (a droning instrumental organ song that makes Won't Be Long TEN times cooler when listened back to back), T.H.E.H.I.V.E.S. (turns into the most self-absorbed cheesy AND FUN disco song, right up there with their superiority complex), Giddy Up! (a lusty DEVO-like disco track), You Dress Up For Armageddon (fun, swinging rocker) and Puppet On a String (slow, droning piano track).  These fun, experimental new tracks, when listened to in proper CD track order, make the album so much more fun.  You get a fun smile about how different or kooky these oddball tracks are, and then before you wonder if the Hives have \\"lost their touch\\", you get a KILLER classic sounding song immediately afterwards.  And, by the time you listen to the album 3x through, you come to love the oddball tracks for themselves.  The classic songs are astounding, the non-classic sounds are damn fun and kooky, but when they're all together, it's a full start-to-finish satisfying music experience.  I'm so glad that The Hives are able to do what they do:  evolve and make their music and shows affordable for everyone.  With three long years between albums, I would want the band to mature, branch out and IMPROVE.  I think they did all three with this.  I also recommend buying the UK version with the bonus track:  Fall Is Just Something That Grownups Invented.  It's 100 mph of Hives fun, and (since the track order of this album is key to its enjoyment) goes perfectly after Bigger Hole To Fill.

B000VI70X6|5.0|Having attended two shows one in Barcelona and the one shown on the dvd in Miami, I can say that Shakira's performance like her music get better and better as she matures. She delivers a great performance that showcases her voice and dancing abilities, while she demonstrates that she does not need a group of dancers or an ornate stage to shine, Shakira shines on her own. Also dont forget to watch the documentary on the Piez Descalzos Foundation, it shows one of the many ways Shakira tries to help out her nation.
B0002Y4TTC|5.0|Awesome gig, decent bonus material. Also, the price is more than fine for a Euro-shopper such as myself ;) All BG fans should check this one out!
B000CNFC76|4.0|When my ten year old son saw that we were putting this DVD into the machine he threw a screamy fit, \\"Not that movie! I don't want to watch that movie!\\"<br /><br />By the end of the film, hole 18, last putt, Francis is ahead by only one stroke, my son was on the edge of his seat with everyone else.<br /><br />I didn't want to see \\"The Greatest Game Ever Played\\" at first myself. When it first came out I could not believe that a young actor with the incredible talent Shia LaBeouf demonstrated in \\"Holes\\" didn't have a better movie to star in than some snoozer about a game of golf. Golf, I thought, is one of the most useless games mankind has invented.<br /><br />This film changed my mind. I can see now that golf has a certain simple charm. You hit a ball with a stick and try to get it to roll into a hole. Even my two-year-old could understand what was happening in this movie. He stood right in front of the screen and jumped up and down and cheered every time the ball went in.<br /><br />I can't say enough about the impressive cinematography, from the opening titles to the last time we see Vardon get into his zone, making everything melt away except the flag at the far end of the green. The acting was good, the pacing was a little slow in places, but I tell you, we were all holding our breath there at the end.<br /><br />As for family friendliness, there was only one case of biblical swearing, and that by a very non-sympathetic character. We all booed him. Best of all, this film sparked a great family discussion on good sportsmanship, which was shown by both Vardon and Ouimet.<br /><br />The one thing I did not like about the film was the antagonistic father character. Why is it that the dad in these sorts of movies insists that the son to do something practical with his life rather than pursue his dreams? Do any parents really do that? Granted, my mom used to get after me for sitting in bed all morning working on my meta-science-fiction graphic novel instead of cleaning my room, and my dad once suggested to me that engineering would be a more practical course than physics, but in general they always encouraged me to develop my talents and pursue my interests. Maybe I'm lucky to have really nice parents.<br /><br />But anyhow, it disturbed me that in \\"Greatest Game\\" dad made son promise to give up golf, and then son had to go and break promise in order to enter tournament and win first place. It wasn't fair of dad to extract the promise, but that was no excuse to go and break it. We talked about that issue with the children too. And what irks me most was that, in real life, Francis Ouimet's father was probably just fine with his son playing golf! Those lousy Hollywood screenplay writers always think they have to add so much drama. Bah!<br /><br />So with all the good fodder for family discussion, and a sport that even a two-year-old can appreciate, I recommend this film to all ages. I think it will be an enduring classic, one of the best sports movies ever made.ngineering would be a more practical course than physics, but in general they always encouraged me to develop my talents and pursue my interests.

B000URDEB0|5.0|The title says it all. While DPP might not be their best, it's a solid comeback from a good band!
B000N4SHOE|5.0|I can not think of the last time I saw a more beautiful film!<br /><br />Perhaps I am biased. The film starts out with Beatrix Potter getting her lucky break with the publishing company. I, myself, have just started trying to sell my first novel, so I nearly cried when the publishers said yes to Beatrix.<br /><br />As Miss Potter drives away in her carriage, trying not to laugh and scream for joy because all she can prim and properly do to celebrate is have the driver go round the park a few extra times, we find out the publishers didn't say yes because they thought Peter Rabbit would sell. They said yes because their little brother, Ewan McGregor, has just joined the firm and they needed an unimportant first project for him to bumble with.<br /><br />What begins as another story of a writer and artist whose once disdained work becomes wildly popular turns into a very human story of love, friendship, loss, and recovery. The acting was incredible! I believed every minute of it. I could not ask for a better script or a better cast to bring it to life. So why do sloppy films like \\"Transformers\\" get in the regular theaters while the brilliant \\"Miss Potter\\" is relegated to the art houses? Let's make amends! Buy it today! It goes right up there on your shelf with your favorite Jane Austen movies.<br /><br />This film is rated PG for some mild language, which I must say I didn't notice. Smaller children will find this film dull, in spite of the lovely animation sequences, but I bet my eleven year old writing, drawing daughter will adore it as much as I did.
B00000HYXB|5.0|Blind Guardian may not be the easiest band to get into, but they're certainly one of the best ones around once you get to know them! Nightfall in Middle-Earth is an instant classic and everyone should listen to it.
B000000LZV|5.0|You know the theme song for the show jack@$$?  The song that sounds like some joke band wrote, making fun of country if anything else?  It was actually by Minutemen, and is found on this album.  The song is Corona, just one song on this 43-track album.  43 different sounds is hard to come up with.  It's an ambitious album, and the songs, as mentioned before, are short.  The great thing is that at least....... damn, I don't even know how many great songs there are!  It's certainly a sprawling album, and the fact that the music is great (with variety !!!), just makes things better.<br /><br />Most punk bands like to play loud as _____ and agressive, not Minutemen.  The three piece power trio adds another talented trio.  Three people? No worries.  D., Mike, and George are all talented, and with their talent, were able to make clean (and messy) music.  Mike Watt is especially good at the bass, his basslines are audible and pop like no other.  He's no Les Claypool when it comes to techniquallity, he dosen't exactly take up lead instrument, but he's a talented bassist.  Any aspiring bassist should give this guy a listen.<br /><br />Double Nickels On The Dime may have a few... or some, clunky tracks on here, but at 74 minutes, that's not going to be a problem. In fact, there isn't a horrible song, there are a average songs, but there not even bad.  A great value, and even better, this stuff is just a blast to play on guitar, bass, or drums.  Not a musician?  No worries.  There's a solution.<br /><br />One word: Air<br /><br />9.0/10
B000Q9IZ5C|4.0|If you liked the series \\"Firefly,\\" you'll love the movie, \\"Serenity.\\"  It is supposed to be the final episode of the short-lived, but immensely popular series.<br /><br />I highly recommend it to all sacience-fiction and western fans.  It's a very well done combination of both.  Well-acted, well filmed, well-produced--WELL DONE!
B000SUKPKM|3.0|If you look through the album credits you will realize that NONE of the tracks are from their Metal Blade years (1987-1995).  Every song is from their last three Warner Brothers albums.  This is really odd since Metal Blade is a division of WB.  Surely it must be a licensing issue; why else would they re-record \\"Name\\"?  The version included here is horrible.<br />If you already own [[ASIN:B000002MUE A Boy Named Goo]], and [[ASIN:B000002MIH Superstar Car Wash]], then this album makes a fine companion, even though it is inexplicably missing \\"Give A Little Bit\\".  For a better overview of the Goo Goo Dolls Metal Blade years, check out [[ASIN:B00005J9YE What I Learned About Ego, Opinion, Art & Commerce]].
B0000640VN|3.0|Kate & Leopold starring Meg Ryan and Hugh Jackman is a cute romantic comedy which features time travel but I felt disappointed and I don't know why. Ryan and Jackman are very talented actors and they have great chemistry in this film but the story feels strange and forced. It's too bad that I didn't like this movie more because this film was directed by James Mangold, he is my favorite director but I just couldn't get into it. Defintely one to rent but not to purchase.
B0000019PA|5.0|Like Rufus Wainwrights' \\"Poses\\" and Sean Lennons' \\"Friendly Fire\\", this is a classy alternative album that is not for everyone. Neutral Milk Hotel might be no more, but they left us this masterpiece of the late 1990s alternative scene - to classify this as 'indie rock' would be doing this a disservice as its a diverse blend of many musical styles.<br /><br />If you can get past the nasal vocal stylings of the lead singer, and the very obviously weird lyrics, you're in for a treat. The album chronicles a young mans' journey through life, with the use of metaphor and allegory. Listeners who have dug deep within this album have mined its' riches - it is full of symbolism and far deeper than any other 'alt rock' title you might have in your catalog.<br /><br />Ten years later, its evident that this band had something special that no other band to this day has managed to capture. Like Jeff Buckley, this is timeless music, and one that should belong in your musical collection.<br /><br />On a side note, this is one of the best album covers of all time. The cover alone will make you weep (listen to the music while looking at the cover, and you'll understand why).<br /><br />Five Stars. Masterpiece.
B000BTGY1O|5.0|Breakfast at Tiffany's directed by Blake Edwards is the perfect romantic comedy/ drama. Released in 1961 and starring Audrey Hepburn is her most enchanting role to date. Hepburn is radiant and vulnerable as call-girl Holly Golightly. George Peppard stars as Holly's potential love interest, his little speech at the end of the film is defintely the best scene. Both stars have amazing chemistry together and the opening shot is 100% genius. Hepburn's style and those gorgeous blonde streaks in her hair give this film a chic and modern look even to this day. The only thing stereotypical in this film is Mickey Rooney passing as a grumpy Japanese landlord, how silly is that? Anyways Breakfast at Tiffany's is pure heaven, and with this speical anniversary collection dvd, the film looks brand new and contains some fun special features. Who doesn't love Tiffany's! Enjoy darling!
B000VWYJ86|3.0|Watching this on the big screen, I felt as though they took everything that was good in the first two movies, and mashed them up hoping it would work again.<br /><br />We all know that the Bourne films give us action sequences like we've never seen before. Here, that trend repeats itself, with an amazing sequence filmed in Morocco where Matt Damon has to save Julia Stiles from a hitman.<br /><br />However, this is not so much a film, as it is an endless string of action vignettes all strung together. One after the other they come at you, and while any action fan is going to have fun watching this, it lacks the emotional depth and mystery that made the first two films such classics. Also, Franka Potente's absence is sorely felt in this film, as Julia Stiles is hardly a match for her.<br /><br />The story gets even more ludicrous - to the point that there is no actual story. At one point, you even had the 'bad guy' hide files named 'Top Secret' (in BOLD RED no less) in a safe and then he looks around to see if no one has observed him. Haven't we left this sort of dumb-as-nails 'suspense' back in the 1980s? I mean, come on, even certain Lifetime movies have more plot than this.<br /><br />So all we get is Matt Damon (in terrific physical shape, though I was surprised at how haggard his face had gotten in the last two years) jumping through glass windows, leaping from building to building - and every image you had of him being a street-smart spy is shattered, as he is reduced to some sort of mega superhero who just WON'T DIE no matter what accident. Toward the end he is involved in a horrific car crash that should have crushed his body, but he just gets up and walks away. I do subscribe to the 'suspension of belief' theory, but this was taking things too far, honestly.<br /><br />The script is very weak. Obvious things are shouted out every now and then, for example - 'Oh My GOD, hes looking at us from across the street!', and 'Oh My GOD, he just drove off the bridge!', like some sort of absurd commentary when we know exactly what happened. I felt this was made for a ten year old rather than for all audiences.<br /><br />This is not to say that the film is bad. On the contrary, the action is always excellent, but I think that this was a terrible way to end the trilogy, especially when the second film in particular had a very strong plot, great emoting, and superb dialog. Here, its just one car chase after another, or one murder attempt to outdo the previous one, and I just felt that director had totally lost all respect for the audience.<br /><br />Three Stars. A very average film. Oh, and an hour after you've watched it, you won't even remember half of it, its that forgettable.en we know exactly what happened.

B00003CY6M|4.0|Serendipity starring John Cusack and Kate Beckinsale is a sweet love story, of course it's not as brilliant as other romantic comedies. This one tries too hard and comes across cheesy after a few viewings but overall, Serendipity is a classy story of boy meets girl, boy loses girl, and boy finds girl again and they live happily ever after. I am a woman who enjoys romantic comedies even though the outcome and the formula is always the same, but Beckinsale is a pretty girl and Cusack is a great actor so that helps. Defintely one to watch if you are having a girls night out. Hope you like it.
0143142356|5.0|Like so many others, I count Pillars of the Earth among my favorites.  That said, I can hardly remember all of the details that other reviewers compare to World Without End.  Given that I last read Pillars fifteen years ago, I don't feel too bad.<br /><br />I'm easy to please, I suppose.  Give me a book with (a) protagonists for whom I care, (b) villains that are easy to hate, and (c) plot enough to keep me reading -- and I'm pretty much going to feel like I got my money's worth.  World Without End satisfied me on all three counts, plus it had enough historical insight to make me think I was gaining some understanding of a small slice of the Middle Ages.  I don't care if it is not exactly \\"historically accurate\\" -- a colorful setting is what I'm looking for. If in the process I happen to pick up a few \\"gems\\" -- such as a fairly accurate etymology of the word \\"quarantine\\" -- that's just lagniappe.<br /><br />It has also given me an excuse to go back and read Pillars again.
6305949980|4.0|Even though mine was authentic dvd released by Buena Vista Home Entertainment and it was truly region 1 but I am having some difficulties to access the set up menu for audio and subtitle. Sometimes the menu for set up did not appeared to the screen and I have to press 'play' or jump to scene to get the DTS track sound. I am also having problem to access the bonus material esspecially to access to Tim Burton's early movie such as Vincent and Frankenweenie. I have to try hard and few times to make sure it appear. By minusing 1 star for this dvd edition, I think is fair enough because of the problems on disc. However the movie absolutely amazing and hopefully Buena Vista will re-release it after fix up all the problems or for Blu Ray and I have no doubt to buy it again!
0767821629|4.0|It was a very thought provoking movie.Not a movie for everyone.Sometimes its nice to watch a movie that gets you thinking.
B00003CY0V|4.0|Before you even START with me, yes I know this movie makes absolutely no sense.  The plot doesn't seem to have a beginning or end and each \\"twist\\" makes a more foolish mess than the last.  But what a blast for visuals!  **SPOILER ALERT**Just reflect on gorgeous Hallie Berry, complete with the \\"it girl\\" accessory a tootsie pop--hitting a long, straight drive off the top of the trailer.  Or all those wonderful ball bearings, or John Travolta's too silly for words villian, soul patch and affected way of smoking a ciggie!  Not too mention the fabulous chase scene and hill roll for Don Cheadle and Hugh Jackman.  Pop a BIG bag of cheese popcorn, grab some peanuts and a Coke (secretly dropping some peanuts into the Coke for a sweet/salty treat), turn off your brain and enjoy this DVD feast of lunacy.
B000WCBMA8|5.0|For any fan of the Rock and Roll you must buy this album immeadiately. Ferocious , in a way only THE HIVES can do it.  Brooding, Punk auteurs take the next step with this fine album.
0440241901|4.0|I loved this book.  Funny, sweet and endearing.  I hated all the shopaholic books, couldn't get past a chapter or two, but I really enjoyed this light fun read.
B000H6SXMY|5.0|This was the best deal I found on this series. All of the disks work flawlessly and I am impressed with all of the background detail contained in the set book. Just perfect if you love this show!
0765348780|4.0|One of the best new Fantasy/Sword & Sorcery authors.    A GREAT read!
B000J10ERO|1.0|Remember to bring a straight razor and or a noose for this movie.  You will be needing it about 15 minutes into the movie.  If you don't want to kill yourself, just don't watch it...
6302886228|5.0|This was the night when everything fell into place. Having watched it on VHS so many times one can hope there'll soon be a release on DVD. Not many video-concerts that gives you goose pimples nowadays but this one certainly does ... Like a Hitchcock thriller the excitement builds up until Neil Young enters the stage. To me, the performance of \\"All Along The Watchtower\\" together with Booker T & The MG's is nothing but pure joy to watch - it must be \\"The greatest video song number of all times\\". Note Steve Cropper's reaction when Neil joins all the other artists for the final - he simply must take his hand with a big smile on his face ...! Six stars out of five ...
0525950079|4.0|The Follett workshop has turned out another quality piece of literature.    It kept me entertained much more than the modern celebrity trials of Britany S and her offsprings.
1593083246|5.0|Classic, timeless, beautiful fiction.  Perfect for young and old (I've read it a dozen times, but it was also a great gift for my niece to introduce her to classic literature).
0753820250|5.0|Like so many really good books, I struggled at the start, becasue the story takes a while to really get going.  But the effort, learning the background and the setting, is so worthwhile because it increases the satisfaction of the book enormously.  It is a thoroughly enjoyable and fulfilling read.  I look forward to reading the next in the trilogy.
B000WGNLLW|4.0|The music is great.  I think they have some real hits on this!! The DVD footage is great for the duranie who needs the inside scoop but there is not much in there.  The enclosed \\"booklet\\" is mostly of the Red Carpet Massacre girls not the band.
B0000TB01Y|5.0|I have to prelude this review by saying that I have neither seen the musical nor read the book it was based on (both things, I hope, that will be remedied very soon.) I bought this CD because a friend of mine had it and had played the song \\"Defying Gravity\\" for me, after which it was stuck in my head for three months.<br /><br />I bought it a few weeks ago, and I have not stopped listening to it since. This is a rare, brilliant gem of a CD, with two truly great songs (Defying Gravity, The Wizard and I, and let's just throw For Good in there for emotional power) and two absolutely hilarious songs (Popular and What Is This Feeling?) The others, though, are by no means bad. Even filler songs like March of the Witch Hunters, Dancing Through Life, and Something Bad are well-written, and the quite intense song near the end, \\"No Good Deed,\\" is great too.<br /><br />But my favorite song on the album would have to be the aforementioned Defying Gravity, whose unforgettable lyrics include, \\"Something has changed within me, something is not the same. I'm through with playing by the rules of someone else's game\\", and \\"I'm through accepting limits 'cause someone says they're so. Some things I cannot change, but till I try, I'll never know...\\" The quality of the actresses' voices and the sound and the songwriting is such that I can actually feel myself there in the theater, watching a musical I've never seen in my life.<br /><br />It's a great CD overall, the best I've seen in awhile. If you've never seen the play, it doesn't matter; the soundtrack provides an outline of important events for observant listeners, telling the story of Elphaba, the green-skinned, idealistic girl who became the Wicked Witch of the West, and of Galinda/Glinda, the shallow popular girl who grew in depth to become the Good Witch of the North. No secrets or plot twists are given away for the casual listener, but if you pay attention, they're there...<br /><br />Highly Recommended.<br /><br />Rating: Masterpiece
0618551050|3.0|This book has two different parts: the first one is vibrant and, even if I did not agree with many of the author's statements, I enjoyed it. You can find some contradictions and doubtful assertions, but it is so lively and well-thought that you cannot stop reading it. You realise that, often, believing in a theory is a matter of how it is told, because I do not think that more than 0.01% of the readers are able to know if the different arguments (pros and cons) are really valid. Really worth reading.    The second part is devoted to the way science is done, and how to improve it. In my opinion, this part is very weak; the way the author justifies the success of the Copenhagen interpretation is unacceptable;  the promotion of alternative theories, difficult to justify; the situation of investigation in Europe, idealized. The good thing is that this part is shorter than the first one.
B000TGJ8IU|4.0|[[VIDEOID:15971961]]Alright, so I think I'll use this video review thing to comment on some more mainstream works where one of my patented long-winded analyses is unnecessary.  This is my second clumsy attempt at this so hopefully I'll become a little more accustomed to speaking to a camera and I can subject you guys to less of the \\"likes\\" and \\"you knows\\" that keep spilling out of me when I'm talking to the electric eye.<br /><br />This DVD is a perfect example of how a director's cut can really alter the quality of a flawed film for the better.  \\"Troy\\" was a decent example of an epic popcorn flick before, but I really think that the added footage pushes it closer to must-see status for fans of this kind of film.  The performances are solid all around, the film looks fantastic, and the story is a classic.  While there is a teensy bit of cheese to be found (\\"Look upon me and despair!\\") and very little humor to break the tension and add more likeability to the characters, this is pretty much as good as historical epics get.  Like I say in the review, the film's biggest flaw is the fact that there are already so many of the same kind of film already out there.
B000OLGCI4|4.0|Anyone who enjoys Disney's traditional animation will love this movie.  Especially for those who are into animation and know Disney animators Frank Thomas and Ollie Johnston.  Traditional animation, anime being the exception, is becoming a thing of the past due to CGI.  This is a great treasure to cherish and to have in one's personal library of films.
0060557818|5.0|This book is the reason I have decided to read everything this person has ever written.  What a wonderful ride through a creepy land of enchantment.

B00005JNJV|3.0|My goodness...with all the 5 star reviews one would think this was the film of the century...its not even the best of the Batman series...Burton's remains the standard by which all others will be judged...Though this film is beautifully shot and has some quality performances (Cillian Murphy, Michael Cane and Bale stand out) the director/writer handcuff would COULD have been a return to the true Batman...Batman's character here starts out as the hardcore avenger that he was meant to be but quickly devolves into a 21st century \\"Oprah-fied\\" version that manages to somehow defeat his enemies without a single death or serious injury...seriously, they even put in dialoge after an extended police chase scene in order to reassure the audience that no policeman were injured during all the rollovers and headon collisions...I felt like I was watching a GI Joe cartoon where lazers whip between peoples legs and pilots always jump from their airplanes with parachutes intact when shotdown...What began with so much promise ends with a dull thud as the \\"water boiling machine\\" (and why doesn't the water in everyone's body turn to steam along with the city's water supply??) is halted with a train derailment...oooo...how very unexciting...If you want a pansified version of Batman this is the movie for you...If you treasure a true \\"Dark Knight\\" stay away....
B000VLE3IS|5.0|You're looking at the newest and best Led Zeppelin hits compilation--Mothership--which includes 2 discs of music spanning the band's studio career, and one DVD of live footage culled from their [[ASIN:B00008PX8P self-titled DVD]].  There's no question about the quality of the material on these discs--every single song is a riff-laden classic, crackling with energy, and it's certainly a treat to see the band at the height of its live abilities.  Considering that Led Zeppelin was a prime mover in popularizing album-oriented rock (as opposed to purely singles-oriented) in the late 60's and early 70's, cutting up some of the finest albums ever made and splicing together some of the transcendent moments onto two CDs seems to slightly contradict the spirit of the band's best music.<br /><br />Who, ideally, is Mothership for?  Well, if you're already a hardcore fan, you'll most likely already have all of Zeppelin's albums and all of this music, as well as the complete DVD set that this disc pulls from.  Only the utter completists would want to add a totally redundant compilation to their collections.  If you enjoy hearing Led Zeppelin on classic rock radio and are interested in actually owning some of their best songs in a compact, 1-case set, this may be a great choice--it's definitely more compact than the separately-sold [[ASIN:B00002SSRG Early Days: The Best of Led Zeppelin, Vol. 1]] and [[ASIN:B00003ZA2Y Latter Days: Best of Led Zeppelin, Vol.2]], and it offers the bonus of DVD video.<br /><br />Honestly, though, if you see yourself ever being interested in Led Zeppelin beyond their token radio hits, I recommend steering clear of this compilation in favor of the actual albums.  Yeah, it's great that Mothership includes the pounding energy of \\"Good Times Bad Times,\\" the epic blues of \\"Dazed and Confused,\\" the radio-ready metal \\"Immigrant Song,\\" the playful eclecticism of \\"Ramble On,\\" D'Yer Maker,\\" and \\"Kashmir,\\" as well as the obligatory grandeur of \\"Stairway to Heaven,\\" but in the context of their original albums, these songs are even more hard-hitting, well-sequenced, and classic.  Not only that, but Led Zeppelin's first five (arguably six) albums are nearly flawless in their songwriting and execution--if you skip out on the full albums in favor of Mothership, you'll also be missing out on all of the other great material that's arguably just as great as these 'greatest hits.'<br /><br />Mothership is most definitely the best career-encompassing Led Zeppelin compilation available at present.  If all you want are the hits in a tidy package, this is the place to get them.  If you're interested in really experiencing what made Led Zeppelin the first of its breed and its members innovators in every sense of the word, the best way to understand, enjoy, and be thrilled into believing the claim that they're the best hard rock band of all time is to experience their albums as they were originally intended--after all, each one is practically a greatest hits package by itself!  Last, if you're looking for a relatively career-spanning compilation that's not quite the same as you hear on the radio, don't miss [[ASIN:B00008OWZC How The West Was Won]]; it's their definitive live collection and a great way to hear a ton of their best songs as raw and epic live recordings.ntext of their original albums, these songs are even more hard-hitting, well-sequenced, and classic.

B000VBJEEG|4.0|First understand that I am a lover of classic disney films such as: Peter Pan, Jungle Book, Old Yeller, Snow White, Bambi, and many others. I am probably more sceptical of recent Disney releases than most of my cohorts, so this movie had to earn 4 stars from me. It is entertaining, a film parents can trust to allow children of all ages watch, and is  equally entertaining for adults. I would by no means put it on par with some of the Disney classics. However, that being said this is by far one of the best films Disney has done in the past 20 years. This film has the feel of one of the classic Disney films prior to the 1980's. A thoroughly enjoyable movie for all ages (I can't say that for all of Disney's recent releases).<br /><br /> My version of this movie comes with two short films. One is the history of the rat, which is actually very educational and informative. The other short is moderately entertaining but nothing I feel deserves more than a passing comment.

B000VI70WM|4.0|Red Carpet Massacre is Duran Duran's 12th studio album (not counting live or Greatest Hits compilations) and marks the first time collaborating with Producers Nate Hills and Timbaland, as well as Justin Timberlake who lends writing and vocal contribution on their first single, \\"Falling Down\\".  To be honest, I wasn't really sure what Duran Duran I was going to get on this new release, or even recognize it as Duran Duran at all. I remember how dissapointed I was about a year ago when guitarist Andy Taylor's departure was announced and wondered what effect it would have(this time around)on the band and the musical style that their fans have come to know. My initial listenings of the Timbaland produced tracks \\"Nite-Runner\\" and \\"Skin Divers\\" a few months back produced a luke-warm reaction but I promised to reserve judgement until hearing the complete work.     I can now say that Red Carpet Massacre is one of their strongest and boldest recordings to date. Anyone who has followed Duran Duran over their career knows that they do not like to produce the same sound twice; so those who are expecting to hear another 'Rio' may be a bit dissappointed. The Timbaland tracks 'Nite-Runner' and 'Skin Divers' have since grown on me, but come up a little short in capturing the essence of Duran Duran as do some of the other tracks on the album.    The album really does have something for everyone, from the heavy club-inspired 'Tempted' (at the moment, my favorite track on the album), to ballads such as 'Box Full O'Honey' and 'Falling Down' reminiscent of some of DD's earlier melodic hits. A great release in Duran Duran's ever broadening repetoire. To quote the boys from Birmingham, \\"Styles change....style doesn't.\\" Red Carpet Massacre is a testament to that.

B000094HMU|4.0|Generally I loath these western stage productions with a Chinese background, but this MET production of Turandot may well be an exception. The sets are beautifully done and finished, very detailed and even refined in certain places. For a Western production one really should not ask for more.<br />Eva Marton as Turandot and Placido Domingo as Calaf both sang as they should, and no more. Marton is sufficiently cold and aloof as the title role princess, and Domingo in fine vocal condition, with perhaps the exception of the famous aria Nessun Dorma. Leonie Mitchell is convincing as Liu both vocally and visually. The biggest bonus, however, comes from the male trio Ping, Pang and Pong. Their excerpt in the second Act is actually the pointer to the theme of the story, and usually in Chinese literature this type of pointer is of fundamental importance. The producer rightly places adequate emphases on this scene, and the three singers really performed marvellously both in terms of singing and acting.<br />The only slight dramatic flaw in this production is the lack of significant high light for the change of heart of Turandot after the death of Liu. Marton could have acted more effectively, but she left most the changes to be brought out by the libretto alone.<br />The music, however, really could not be bettered under James Levine's firm conducting. Generally speaking, this is a very entertaining production of a famous Pucini work.

B000VI70WM|3.0|While this has been heralded as a much anticipated return to the Duran Duran dance floor, \\"Red Carpet Massacre\\" is dominated by its producers. It certainly does make it a club-ready batch of songs, yet it lacks the ready charm of 2004's [[ASIN:B0002X591A Astronaut]]. There's nothing here to rival \\"Hungry Like The Wolf,\\" \\"I Don't Want Your Love,\\" or even \\"Notorious.\\" Like most of Timbaland's projects, making beats seem to take precedence over making actual songs, and for some reason, rinky-dink sounding electronic pulses have supplanted a drummer. It makes the lead-off track, \\"The Valley\\" tinkle like a Lego-set instead of a Killer (pun 100% intended) offensive tackle.<br /><br />This is the primary fault with \\"Red Carpet Massacre.\\" The production lacks meat. There is no muscle, no flesh to these machine driven songs, and other than Simon LeBon's distinct vocals, much of this could have been any other dime-store pop band. There is too much Britney Spears and not enough Brandon Flowers. Saving the album from [[ASIN:B00004TKMJ Pop Trash]] oblivion is - of all people - Justin Timberlake. The ballad he co-wrote, \\"Falling Down,\\" is one of the album's highlights. Timberlakes' [[ASIN:B000H305U0 FutureSex / LoveSounds]] obviously influenced RCM, as the coolest dance tracks sound like Timberlake personally handed \\"Skin Divers\\" or \\"Nite Runner\\" directly to the band.<br /><br />It's just that the old \\"Sex Pistols meets Chic\\" aesthetic seems to have gone by the wayside in favor of an updated sound. Only the buzz-saw instrumental and the giddy \\"Girls On Film\\" reminiscent title track harkens back to the band's younger days. It makes \\"Red Carpet Massacre\\" a mid-level Duran Duran album, on a par with [[ASIN:B000007PSU Liberty]] or [[ASIN:B00000DQSV Notorious]]...competent and experimental, just not a late-game stunner like [[ASIN:B000002V1D The Wedding Album]] and [[ASIN:B0002X591A Astronaut]] were.

B000VL9XE2|5.0|Expectations were high for this album. That tends to happen when a band takes a few years of touring and changing members around between releases, so in a sense, the chips were somewhat stacked against DEP before this record even hit the stores. Still, there was always hope that they would blow a few minds... the growth apparent over the course of their discography made it almost impossible to guess what Ire Works might sound like. Would it be the calculated chaos of Calculating Infinity? The melodic mathcore of Miss Machine? The experimental ennui of Irony is a Dead Scene? I have good news: It's all of those things.<br /><br />Ire Works starts off with a bang on \\"Fix Your Face\\" and continues the expected brutality with \\"Lurch,\\" but by the time you get to the third track \\"Black Bubblegum\\" something is amiss... in a good way. Dillinger sounds focused in a way they never have before. Sure, they've always been good at math, but on Ire Works they're allowing themselves the room to be song-writers first and headache inducers second. This is not a bad thing. Listen to the instrumental (!) tracks \\"When Acting as a Particle\\" and \\"When Acting as a Wave\\" to see just how far these boys have come, and why they've grown exponentially in popularity. Yes, this is the same DEP that melted faces off with 43% burnt, but they've surpassed themselves yet again.<br /><br />Witness the beautiful and haunting \\"Dead as History.\\" The piano is pushed to the forefront and the melody is allowed to come out and play. Of course immediately following that is the all-out barrage of \\"Horse Hunter,\\" which melts into a jazz-influenced breakdown and then goes all out thrash.<br /><br />Those fans who want a return to the pure chaos of the old days might be disappointed, but I have a hard time believing that. This record is simply amazing. I almost took a star off because it's so short, but after listening to it, I didn't feel as though I was left wanting. The boys put together an album that feels like a complete journey, and for that fact alone, this album is worth checking out even for those unfamiliar with the assault that is the Dillinger Escape Plan. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.for that fact alone, this album is worth checking out even for those unfamiliar with the assault that is the Dillinger Escape Plan. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.
B000002HHB|5.0|I was skeptical about this album initially after reading the scathing review  Rollin Stone magazine gave it. It just shows that you can't always trust the megalomaniac corporation that that magazine is.  [[ASIN:B000002HHB Tigerlily]] is an astounding collection of songs from a woman obviously trying to shake her reputation as band fronter for 10,000 Maniacs. Accomplished and wholly cohesive is the only real way to describe this album, never in a long time have I heard an album where no song deliberately tries to tussle for your attention. Commanding your concentration, \\"Tigerlily\\" does seem quite lengthy, but in that length appears some real stellar songwriting. In places the songs are quite charming (\\"Wonder\\") but never kitsch. While in others the quality of the whole song is just superb (\\"San Andreas Fault\\"). The cover art is amazing although Natalie does look a little dull. \\"Tigerlily\\" has a timeless feel to it and sounds distinctly American. There is a story that Aileen Wuornos listened to this album on death row, if so her last years must have been blessed by this pastoral and effectively classic album.
0553260111|5.0|Robert Ludlum's The Bourne Identity, is the explosive beginning to the Bourne Series. It is a great book to read for all people; young adult to adult.  \\"Two abrupt explosions pierced the sounds of the sea....  A man lunged out of the door grasping the railing with one hand, holding his stomach with the other.  A second man followed....   The man at the railing whipped both his hands up to his head, arching backward under the impact of the fourth bullet\\" (7).  Within the first paragraph of chapter one we are introduced to so much imagery and action.      A classic page-turner is just one way of describing this book that follows the journey of one man to self-discovery.  This unknown man is pulled out of the Mediterranean Sea off the coast of Port Noir, France by two fishermen where he'd been dumped after being shot.  For three weeks he is slowly nursed back to health by a drunken English doctor who finds a thin strip of microfilm imbedded under the flesh of his hip leading him to a bank in Zurich, Switzerland.  Armed with an address, a bank account number, no name and no memory, he travels to Zurich and he leaves with $4 million dollars and a name, Jason Bourne, his first link to his former life.  As he continues along his journey he's confronted by memories, enemies and seemingly close old friends that he may or may not be able to trust.  Throughout the story Ludlum employs imagery, characterization and a representation of reality to appeal to and engage the everyday reader.    Imagery  All throughout the novel Ludlum utilizes imagery, giving picture-perfect descriptions of locations that allow the reader to be transported into the book, to feel the cold of the sea, to taste the salty air of the Mediterranean, and to hear the busy streets of Paris.  \\"The waves rose to goliathan heights, crashing into the hull with the power of raw tonnage; the white sprays caught in the night sky cascaded downward over the deck under the force of the night wind\\" (7).  You can see waves in the storm and feel their power.  \\"The rue Sarrasin was no more than two hundred feet long, frozen in time between the stone walls of waterfront buildings, devoid of streetlights, trapping the mists that rolled off the harbor\\" (41).  The darkness surrounds you and you can visualize where you are.  \\"He knew the lobby; the heavy, dark, polished wood was familiar... somehow.  And the huge plateglass window that looked out over Lake Zürich\\" (48).  The bank becomes a real place that we can visualize going into through Ludlum's description.  \\"And there were other sounds - three - lethal, sharp, sudden.  Cracks of muted weapon - weapons; wood splintered on the molding of the proscenium arch\\" (73).  Without explicitly stating that a gun was fired at them, Ludlum, through description carries the point across.    Characterization  Ludlum also makes use of characterization to let the reader connect to the characters and feel for them.  \\"The languages, your knowledge of geography - cities I've never or barely heard of - your obsession for avoiding the use of names, names you want to say but won't\\" (16).  This is our first look at Bourne before we know his name or anything about him.  He doesn't know why he knows these things and neither do we but we all want to discover the answer.  We grow with Bourne as he goes from a semi-one dimensional to a multi-dimensional character.  Bourne intuitively gives the name of a hotel to his cab driver.  The clerk at the hotel recognizes him and helps him fill out his check in sheet giving him his name.  \\"You are J. Bourne, citizen of the United States, resident of New York City, `seventeen-twelve - zero-fourteen - twenty-six-zero' are the most important things in your life.\\"  He recites this to himself in the mirror to memorize who he is, mostly to convince himself.  However, as Bourne learns more of his past and first endangers and later saves Marie St. Jacques, someone he can finally trust, you begin to understand him and his motive;to find out his past.  The reader is just like Bourne; he doesn't know his past and neither do we.  As readers we find out everything about Bourne at the same time as he does.      In addition to Bourne, we are given another character to watch change with Bourne.  \\"[She was in her] mid-thirties and spoke French softly, rapidly\\" (64).  \\"A woman in a dark red dress, the rich color of the silk complementing her long, titian hair....  Auburn hair\\" (68).  Marie St. Jacques first encounters Bourne in an elevator and the two don't talk until he requests her help with something.  At first she comes across as stuck-up and then very emotional.  However, Marie has the same reaction to Bourne as the reader does at first; Bourne is ruthless and calculating yet as we come to know Bourne we change our view, and Marie comes to want to help him.    Representation of Reality  Ludlum's extensive knowledge of events in the book allows us to step into an alternate reality of espionage, an amnesic spy and danger.  This is partly due to the accuracy of his description of places and dealings but also through the use of foreign languages. Through his extensive knowledge Ludlum invites us into the world of Jason Bourne, to live what he lives.  \\"The cranial wound was the real problem; not only was the penetration subcutaneous, but it appeared to have bruised the thalamus and hippocampus fibrous regions\\" (13).  The description of where the wound is is vivid and we know exactly where on the head Bourne was shot.  Bourne and Marie are chased by German hired killers who yell at them in German.  Similarly Bourne and Marie interrupt an Italian presenter and he yells \\"è insoffribile! Ci sono comunisti qui!\\" (73). Through the foreign language we get a real sense for where we are and who these people are.    Conclusion  As the tangled web of espionage, conspiracy, and suspense begins to unravel, the reader is taken along for Bourne's journey to self-discovery and inner struggle between good and evil, entering a world of double crossing, betrayal and back-stabbing.  Ludlum uses vivid imagery, extensive characterization and a real sense of reality to appeal to all readers creating an amazing book that all should read.
B000WCBMA8|5.0|The Hives Black and White Album is somehow so new and so true at the same time. Some of the songs like \\"Giddy Up\\", \\"Puppet on a String\\" and \\"A Stroll Through Hives Manor Corridors\\" sound so different from The Hives usual style, style that songs like \\"Tick Tick Boom\\", \\"Bigger Hole to Fill\\" and \\"It Won't be Long\\" embody.

B00009ATIX|3.0|I'm really not sure if I love or hate this film.  It begins with a sort of Alien or Outlands feel to it, i.e. that there  is an unknown force on a space station that is killing and/or causing people to go mad.  The tension builds as the source of the madness is exposed but then the story flatlines.  Love and loss are the primary themes.  Solaris is not an action/adventure movie.  Space is merely the setting for a love story that is something of a cross between Ghost and What Dreams May Come.<br /><br />Every once in awhile, a work like this simply baffles me.  I don't know whether to recommend it or tell others to avoid it.  I can say that I would never buy and will certainly never watch it a second time, but I got something positive out of it that I cannot quite describe.
B000VNMMQG|5.0|The title of this movie threw me.  When I first heard about this movie, I figured it would be about John Newton who wrote the famous hymn.  Instead, it tells the story of William Wilberforce, the man who led the fight to end slavery in England.  The hymn of the title is William's favorite hymn and shows up a few times in the soundtrack.  Still, I don't completely get why the movie got this title.  Either way, that's my only complaint.<br /><br />William Wilberforce (Ioan Gruffudd) was a member of Parliament during the late 1700's.  He hadn't been in politics too long when God got a hold of him.  While he was good at politics, he felt pulled to devote his life to God.  But through the encourage of his friends, especially Prime Minister to be William Pitt (Benedict Cumberbatch) and preacher John Newton (Albert Finney), he found another calling for his life - leading the fight to end slavery in the British Empire.<br /><br />This movie begins in 1797, and in a series of flashbacks, tells the story of William beginning his struggle to end slavery.  In 1797, his poor health and constant defeats lead him to almost give up his calling.  Will he stop or keep fighting?<br /><br />William Wilberforce was a deeply committed Christian, and that influenced much of his life.  But don't let that fact scare you away from this wonderful film.  Christianity is an ever present part of the story, but the movie never preaches.  And, unlike many Christian movies, this one is well written, acted, and produced.<br /><br />I often have a hard time getting into period movies, and this one was no exception.  But once I figure out who everyone was, I got lost in the story.  The movie brings in the larger historical context, making it that much richer.  And the costumes and sets are wonderful.  Everyone in the cast does a great job.  Obviously, the movie is mostly series, but a few comic moments help lighten the mood.  They really took me by surprise and made me laugh out loud.<br /><br />Mainly through words, this movie depicts the harsh realities that were the slave trade.  Frankly, this made the horror all the more real to me.  There are two uses of the \\"n\\" word.  They are jarring.  While historically accurate, I think their use was intended to jar us.<br /><br />As I watched the story unfold, I couldn't help but notice how little has changed in politics in the last 200 years.  Frankly, this gave me hope that some of the issues of today will eventually be resolved despite how it looks from year to year.<br /><br />This is an inspiring movie.  We need more men like William Wilberforce today who will fight, not because it is politically expedient, but because it is right.harsh realities that were the slave trade.

B000003TA4|2.0|Ok, Im probably gonna get flamed here, but I dont care. I have never like Nirvana, nor will I ever like them. Kobain's death was a tragic loss, I cared about him as a fellow human being, but never a musician. What else can I say about that. I grew up in the 70's and 80's, during the singer/songwriter time, and in the 80's during the Punk, New Wave, Hairband time, so for me, when Nirvana came along with their NEO-PUNK anthems, I hated it all. They said that the GRUNGE MOVEMENT defined GEN X, well not for me. I rebuke that. Grunge killed everything else, which alot  of you might think thats a good thing the Hairbands died, but I dont. The Gunge/NEO HIPPY scene of the early 90's made me sick to my stomach....I was born in 67, and my generation did not know a freaking thing about being hippies. Nirvana killed good music back then, as far as Im concerned, but hey, what is my opinion worth anyway. To each his own....
B000VKJ6VS|5.0|My God, when I firt heard this album I couldn't believe my ears.  At first I was a little skeptical of this cd and wasn't expecting much based on the last album which was sub par, but the band has really come together and found themselves and discovered a truly brilliant, refreshing metal sound.  The singer's deep and resounding lyrics echo with astonishing power over some of the coolest metal riffs I've heard in a long time.  The guitar work compiles an assortment of fast-chug riffs reminiscent of bands like Metallica, classical style riffs, and thick, bluesy bends as well as face melting shred licks in the solos.  This album is astounding from start to finish, except the last song which is still okay, just not as good as the rest.  This is the best album I've heard since Avenged Sevenfold's City Of Evil.  This album is for anyone who enjoys fast riffs and brilliant guitar playing as well as tasteful composition and incredible singing (there is no screaming).  I highly recommend this album to anyone.  A truly great and original sounding album, a piece of art- if it isn't your style of music it will become your style of music.  Go get it!
B000001E18|3.0|Lest time causes us to forget, ZOOROPA was as anticipated an album as Nirvana's IN UTERO in the pre-Woodstock '94 environment. And that is because U2's ACHTUNG BABY was the only album of 1991 to rival NEVERMIND in terms of creative response and chart overthrow. Of course, it was not considered a surprise that U2 dominated the charts in 1991-92. Only that the material they threw out there was so different, and that it was an example of an '80s band being accepted by the alternative/indie crowd, post-\\"Smells Like Teen Spirit.\\"    What followed was U2's pop-art installation tour, known as ZOO TV, where thousands of televisions, German Trabants, Lou Reed projection, belly dancers and shiny Elvis suits were all thrown into the mix to create a multimedia spectacle, every bit as nuanced as it was satirical. The tour hosted a bevy of cool alternative era opening acts, such as the Pixies, Primus and Disposable Heroes of Hipophrisy. And in lieu of the tour's success, as well as five ACHTUNG BABY hit singles, ZOOROPA landed in 1993 after radio had already been barraged with the sounds of their launch single \\"Numb.\\"    \\"Numb\\" caused serious debate amongst fans and aficianados, for, well, basically sounding like your favorite stadium rock band was loaded into a computer and someone hit the \\"random\\" button. And while the rest of the album never quite went as far into the post-rock genre as \\"Numb,\\" I fondly remember co-ed pool parties and smoke-out sessions with this album all summer long. When IN UTERO hit a year later, we sat much more mezmorized to the universal message of \\"Rape Me,\\" knowing full-well where things stood. But ZOOROPA was a sign of the times too, and induced many good conversations about our consumer culture and how far a rock band should take things, experimentally. My answer was, as it is now, farther.     I also had high-hopes for U2's follow-up album, POP (1997), as I enjoyed enormously their Passengers project from 1995. However, nothing on POP (sans \\"Mofo\\")lived up to sonic tone-poems like \\"Lemon,\\" \\"Daddy's Gonna Pay for Your Crashed Car\\" or ZOOROPA's title track. Also of note is the lead vocal appearance by Johnny Cash on closing track, \\"The Wanderer.\\" I honestly can't remember if Cash's AMERICAN RECORDINGS album (with producer Rick Rubin) came first, but it was a sign that the darker elements of American country music were connecting with the alternative generation (Jayhawks, Wilco), as happened with the Baby Boomers previously (e.g. Gram Parsons, Poco, Byrds). How much U2 had to do with the cultural divide between conservative-mainstream country and the burgeoning alt-country movement is hard to say. I only remember many U2 fans feeling confused by \\"The Wanderer.\\"    After ACHTUNG BABY, ZOOROPA and POP, U2 retreated to a tried-but-true angle they'd aspired to in the late '80s, abandoning existential satire for sincerity. Maybe they just got older. Maybe the pressure mounted. Or maybe that's where they felt most comfortable. But while ZOOROPA didn't have the songwriting chops that graced ACHTUNG BABY, and while it wasn't as evenly listenable as the Passengers album... I still find ZOOROPA taking me back to those teenage days when rock was on its last leg, and yet none of my friends had given up hope.
B00004TX5F|3.0|A good source of entertainment, but historically inaccurate.  For one thing, Farinelli famously DID NOT sing Handel's music; he sang for the rival company in London and maintained a very antagonistic relationship with Handel.
B0000AKCLS|4.0|Great guitar work from joe! Even toning it down a bit for the more traditional blues, Joe does some serious ripping on some great blues standards.
057109659X|4.0|Firstly, I want to chide all those whose lame counting of the book's contents parrots publisher information, such as \\"The result of Mr. Ashley's research was a significant collection of 7,000 drawings of 3,900 knots\\" -- this is nonsense:  Ashley numbers every **illustration**, culminating with \\"#3854\\"; and among these there are both a great many duplicates (a quick look in the Index will show many occurrences for \\"Two Half Hitches\\", \\"Clove Hitch\\", & \\"Constrictor\\", e.g.), and there are many illustrated items that most folks won't regard as \\"knots\\".  A more realistic figure for hitches, e.g., is around 100-200, and likewise for loopknots & bends.    People who are fascinated by knots refer to this book as \\"the bible\\", and often refer to particular knots by some Ashley illustration number -- which is a good step towards removing the typical ambiguity of knot names!    More than most knots books, Ashley gives historical and practical information about his subject; and, also more than most, his information is more reliable.  I.p., this book is VASTLY superior to the seemingly competing knots tome, _Encyclopedia of Knots & Fancy Ropework_, which seems to be mostly a product of silly imagination by authors unconcerned with reality or good sense (to put it mildly!).    But Ashley wrote in a time preceding modern synthetic fibres such as nylon, polypropylene, and polyester (to say nothing of HMPE, aramids, composites, and coextruded fibres), and his inventory of knots reflects this -- perhaps most especially regarding anglers knots.  Someone interested in learning about arborists' climbing/friction hitches or rockclimbers belay and anchor rigging or fishing knotting/rigging will find little or no help here.
B000VBJEEG|4.0|I think this film is a tad overrated, but it's negatives are with the story and dialogue primarily.  I still enjoyed the film very much.  I've always liked most of what Pixar has done (which may surprise some of my friends here), and this film is a good addition to their catalogue.  There were a few problems, though.  I felt there was too much expository information, especially at the beginning.  Much of the dialogue (and situations) were very predictable, including the usual \\"the French are rude\\" stuff.  I didn't buy the romance between Colette and Linguini.  It felt forced, and didn't seem like it would really happen, in movie life or in real life.  The repartee between the rats seemed forced, too.<br /><br />On the good side, the film is visually immaculate.  Brad Bird does a tremendous job here, and he has a great sense of composition.  I wish I had seen it in a theater.  The animation is positively gorgeous.  The voices are very well done for the most part, and my favorite characters are Peter O'Toole's Anton Ego (great name) the critic, and Gusteau, voiced by Brad Garrett.  Many made hay of Janeane Garofalo's French accent for Colette, but I feel Garrett's is much, much better.  Garofalo's accent, while good, had a few dropouts here and there where her real voice came through.  This is not entirely her fault, as they changed her character to one with a French accent late in the production, and she did the best she could on such short notice.  Many were surprised that Garofalo managed to do an accent pretty well.  I'm not.  I've always believed in her talent.  Patton Oswalt (best known for his recurring role in The King of Queens, and one of the funnier standup comedians today) is fine as Remy, the rat who can cook.  The film has a real nice wrap up too, incorporating Gusteau's phrase that \\"anyone can cook\\", and Peter O'Toole's final speech in the film is surprisingly moving and stirring.  So, people should definitely rent this film.  It's not perfect, but it is still head and shoulders above most dreck at theaters these days....ill head and shoulders above most dreck at theaters these days....
0810993139|5.0|My son (9 years)just loves this book! He's been reading parts of it over and over again and insists that I listen in and laugh along. I find the style reminiscent of the Captain Underpants books, but with better spelling and grammar.  I doubt that my reluctant writer is going to be inspired to start journalizing, but others might. I highly recommend this book.
B000VI70WM|4.0|for the opening track The valley, your gonna hope you hear somemore song like this and you do, the only songs that dont fit, Falling down, too long, the radio edit should have been on the cd, and Box full o honey, these songs bring the cd to a stand still they sould have been left off, or placed at the end. but, songs like nite-runner, Skin divers, Temped, Zoom in, Last man standing....great....Duran Duran...welcome back. I am a big fan, and i love this cd. Hats off to Mr. Timberlake, I think alot of people will love it. I cant wait to hear the next cd. Cheers boys, it the best thing you guys have done in years.  pass up track 4 and 5.....it a tight cd. thanks guys.

B000VI70WM|3.0|After you get an AMAZING album like Astronaut, which was true to form DD with a modern edge. You then wait for another masterpiece and get this album. Why oh why oh why do they have to follow the norm. People that buy Duran albums want Duran Duran not modern day fluff. EVERY Timbaland song sounds like a Timbaland song, same beats, same chords, and not AT ALL like Duran Duran. He's the flavor of the month just like...wait...what was his name...Dark Child who made everyone say his name in their songs. The only true to form Duran songs would be The Valley and Red Carpet Massacre but the rest are an attempt to be hip and lose their original style that made them who they are.    Duran Duran needed to stick to their true to form Duran songs like Nice, Sunrise, Want You More, these are classic tracks that are modern but have the Duran twist. This album was soooo rushed and even this Falling Down song is unlistenable. The Wedding Album has already been done and it was not true to form. I rarely critique their work so harshly but this album was such a disappointment. We don't want Rio and Save A Prayer all over again but give the true fans what they want and not attempt to be grabbing so many new fans. We want the music, the hooks, the energy, not this MASSACRE of a Duran Duran album. This ranks right up there with Thank You :-(
B000MRAAJW|5.0|The \\"Planet Earth\\" HD/DVD is absolutely fantastic! The images are incredibly  clear, the presentation flows nicely and will not only capture your attention, but keep you wondering constantly how on earth they were able to  take these pictures.  Even our teenage sons watch these DVDs and are impressed (not easily done)! Amazon also had the best price and their usual good and timely delivery.
B000SO7OM0|5.0|I had the immense pleasure of catching Loreena McKennitt live in concert this past spring. Loreena is easily one of my favorite artists of all time. NIGHTS FROM THE ALHAMBRA is a great reminder of seeing Loreena performing live. The three disc set includes two cds and a dvd of her PBS performance from this past March. I never buy live albums but Loreena is the one artist who I have made the exception to that rule. Much to my delight, her PBS performance transferred on to disc quite well. I felt like I am in the audience every time I listen to the album. Her concert is a mixture of old and recent material. I am glad that she packaged the live album with her PBS performance. It definitely made the album worth every single penny spent on it. NIGHTS FROM THE ALHAMBRA is a definite must have for Loreena McKennitt fans.
B000WQ9UA8|1.0|I've given every song on this album a chance. And I can honestly say that not only is it \\"not good\\", it's to the point of just being noise. Annoying, terrible, tasteless noise. I have listened to Madonna all my life and I admit that once and a while Madge would come out with a song or two that were crappy... but an entire album being this bad is just pathetic. People who like this album like Britney. At least, I hope they like Britney a lot. Otherwise they actually like the \\"music\\" (noise) and that is just plain scary. Gimme More is the ONLY song that is dance-worthy. The others are just over-produced trash. I kept thinking there'd be another song that would be at least \\"fun\\" to dance to, but painful to listen to is more like it. Horrible, horrible and more horrible.
B000ULQV0W|5.0|INTO THE WILD is easily my favorite film of 2007. The story of Christopher McCandless is absolutely heartbreaking. Pearl Jam singer Eddie Vedder provides his musical talents to the Sean Penn film, creating an acoustic sound that captures the essence of the film. I never really was a fan of Pearl Jam and never will be but I absolutely loved Eddie's solo work for the film. Eddie's solo acoustic work is a far cry from the monotonous drones of Pearl Jam. His lyrics really captured the story of Christopher McCandless and his journey across America and eventually into Alaska. Love the book, film, and now the soundtrack.
0743486285|5.0|I purchased this book after hearing about it on the radio. I started reading it the day I got it in the mail. I couldn't put it down. The book was as addictive to read as the heroin was for Nikki. Definately recommend. Extremely interesting...how in the hell was Motley Crue ever successful?

B000VWE5OY|5.0|Torchwood is a gorgeous, thrilling sci-fi series that takes the otherworldly-ness of The X-Files, some hilarious one-liners ( mostly ala Owen, or at his expense), and is just plain sexy. Hello, sex-mad alien gas in episode 2!       Twisted and dark, with just enough throw-away lines for Doctor Who fans to giggle and/or sniffle at (\\"The right kind of Doctor.\\"), its great for any sci-fi fan.      As a side note, this is NOT for early teens. Theres, among other things, a openness about sexuality ( one episode sees Jack falling in love with the man whose name he took for a 1940s con). So I only recommend this for people who wont squick over Jack's sexuality or the sometimea randy humor you can get away with on BBC.
B000VI70WM|1.0|I understand how bands grow, change their sound, etc, but this is unlistenable, not catchy and just plain boring.  Thought the last album was great, a real comeback in the making. But this follow up is completely disappointing.
0739358138|3.0|I was getting ready to hop into my car for a total of 24 hours of driving, an intermediate step before relocating and starting my new job on Wall Street.  While I'm not going to be a stockbroker, this seemed like an interesting option among the available choices on the shelf.      The first thing that I would point out is that I do not like the voice dictating this book on the CD.  The other two books I've heard on CD had much better speakers.  Its not so annoying that I couldn't listen to this, though.  Something you get used to.      As a listener, you don't see any development of Jordan.  He is just a lowly connector in the first chapter, and then, six years later, he is the \\"Wolf of Wall Street\\".  I would have thought this would have been part of the interestingness.  How do you go from being an innocent yet worthless kid on Wall Street to ripping off the richest of Americans for their millions?      He uses so many lame similes.  An example of something he might say: \\"Jordan's writing style sucks like an escort girl, trying to get a golf ball through 10 feet of a garden hose.\\"  His writing style really does suck.      Many characters are simply described to have no relevance to his story.  For example, he talks about going to lunch with Steve Madden, shoe designer, and how Steve referred to a mob boss by his \\"mob name\\", which he didn't like.      On the other hand, it was an interesting way to present part of Steve's personality: that he was an idiot.      Its easy for me to dislike this book...but the fact that I'm able to talk about it for a while clearly means that I liked it in some ways.  Listening to the book was definitely a good way to kill a few hours.  I just wish I could have heard the beginning of the story before starting with the demise of Jordan right at the start.  Maybe having a better editor/writer could have made the story more easily enjoyable.
B000002KKS|5.0|The few critical reviews this has received here on Amazon seem concerned that Sabbath had somehow sold out and started producing cheesy, lightweight music with Dio. The reality is that they had already started down that path (with rather disastrous results) on Technical Ecstasy and Never Say Die. Heaven and Hell, which BTW is one of the best-selling albums in the band's catalog, was a vast improvement over those two turds and completely revitalized Sabbath's flagging career.
0823016714|4.0|Any artist, not just cartoonists would find this book useful.  The book presents a nice range of ages, races, and genders.  At the back of the book are close-ups of mouth articulations of consonants and vowels.  Also, there is a reference shots of the skull and different hats and head gear photographs as well.
0060763892|5.0|When I first read Sandstorm it definetly reminded me of Indiana Jones to a certain degree which is always a good thing.    The latest offering from Rollins is like a combination of National Treasure, Indiana Jones and the DaVinci code!    Once again it's Sigma vs. the Guild, but the Guild isn't the worst of Sigma's problems.  They're facing a disaster of pandemic proportions that can possibly kill the entire planet's ecosystem as we know it.    Sound a little over the top? It's easy to think from that short description that it's wayyyy to broad in scope, almost James Bond in scale and incredulity, but Rollins makes it work based on weaving scientific facts along with historical facts and some creative liberties to make a fantastic read.    Some old characters, some new, all interesting.  A great read if you're a fan of rollins or have already read the other Sigma Force novels.  If you haven't read the previous three sigma force novels, I'd say readin them prior to this will make it even more engaging and entertaining, but it's not a necessity.    A great great ending as well!
B000VDDDY6|5.0|At $132 its cheaper than the cost of HDD media to rip it to (in my case this is necessary as otherwise my player has a tendency to freeze during playback) and the cost of renting each disk.  How many titles can you say that of in either HD-DVD or DVD format?  Given your typical new HD-DVD release is about $27 a disc and twice the price of the DVD for the same title this is actually really good value!    I haven't seen the disc yet so can't comment on the content quality - we get a \\"preview\\" at our local cinema in a couple weeks.
0784011710|4.0|Meryl Streep at her best, gorgeous and vulnerable.  Kevin Kline, spectacular.    Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman tried to copy them in 'Eyes wide shut' with no success.  A Modern, more technically advanced Elvira Madigan?  This is a movie to own.  Watch it annually to remind you to never, ever fall victim of living in a rut.  Destruction of ourselves in the need and helpless want of passion.
1582701709|3.0|there is nothing wrong with positive thinking and believing in happiness and visualizing good things and all that fun stuff.  what i couldn't get over is how selfish this book is.  i mean, it is literally about \\"me, me, me.\\"  doesn't happiness come from giving and serving and helping others as much (or more than) yourself?  it's all fine and dandy to \\"attract\\" everything you could ever possibly want through your positive thinking.  but how about helping others?  here's an idea, rhonda byrne can write a sequel:  \\"the secret:  using it to work for others and not just your own selfish desires.\\"
B000000OR9|5.0|You will like this cd because the style is the same of the cd 1987 of David Coverdale's whitesnake, John is not only a master of guitar but a great singer too, you will listen how is great in this first cd of this band.
074356619X|4.0|If you are considering The Secret but are skeptical that it will be cheesy than stick to the CD.  I found the DVD to be cheesy.      This is a really great book, CD, DVD that will help train you to think positive.  Very uplifting.  Something that you can listen to again and again.
B000FTWB7G|4.0|My favorite Evanescence CD is still \\"Fallen\\", but this is a worthy follow-up to that debut album. Amy Lee is amazing as always, and the songs are powerful. Not quite as many sing-along-type songs (for some reason the lyrics don't stick in my head as well as the Fallen songs), but still definitely a good production.     Favorites? Lithium & Snow White Queen
B000MGUZKM|2.0|Overall it's really well played, what less could you expect from masters like Christian McBride or Ray Parker Jr.? Also, needless to say, Crawford's voice is technically perfect and Sample's keyboards soulful as ever. But, apart from a few songs like \\"sea line woman\\" or \\"last night at danceland\\" the end result is somehow deficient in terms of inspiration. Generally, I'm afraid, the album sounds a little contrived, reminding me of \\"Morph the Cat\\" by Donald Fagen, in the sense that it tries to hard and ultimately fails to recreate the magic of the early albums. I find the Crusaders' albums lovely not for their musical virtuosity but, rather, for their unbeatable charm, a quality that seems to be lacking here. Who knows, maybe it's that the plasticized 00's fail to provide the right mood.  P.s. Thinking again about it, it probably deserves 3 stars but unfortunately I can't go back and edit my rating.
B000687M48|3.0|I really enjoyed watching the DVD on this movie. Since I've never gotten to attend a live Evanescence concert yet, it was cool to see what they are like live. Great DVD ..     On the CD side of this package, I was a bit dissapointed. I realize it's a live recording, but it's hard to hear the words in the songs because of the recording. There's also a lot of crowd noise.     So my take? Buy this for the DVD - you will love it .. but get the Fallen CD for the same tracks that are on this but in a studio recorded version. The live ones just aren't as good.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I admit I came \\"late to the game\\" on Firefly.  Although I am a fairly big SciFi fan, I had never seen any episodes of Firefly when I purchased the series. I had the \\"Serenity\\" DVD and thought I would enjoy the series that initiated the film - hoping it would explain some of the questions I had.  And it did!  Unfortunately it also lured me into a series that is already gone. :-(    Don't know what it is about Joss Wheadon series that they just seem to end too quickly.  I would be thrilled if several of his came back including Firefly!!!
B000WCBPOG|5.0|Show the movie four times and learned to appreciate the Mclen versions done by each of the artists. 31 of 33 is much better than the original soundtrack with just 16 of 33!
B00065MDSQ|3.0|As someone who loves the later Discipline-era Crimson, and liked the earlier Court of the Crimson King, I am surprised how unenthusiastic I was after several listenings to Red. It's fine, but not notable. KC has recast itself multiple times - to me, this version of the band doesn't warrant all the 5-star reviews.
B000089CPF|5.0|I can talk about this song or that, or how Calexico has a distinctive and beautiful sound, and all that. Here's how I know this album is good. After I got it, I played it for an entire week to the exclusion of pretty much everything else.    It gets under your skin it's so good. It changes pace and style from song to song, so you don't get bored, and songs don't all convolve together into just one indistinguishable pile of music. It'll keep in your mind even after you turn it off, and you'll look forward to getting back home so you can listen to it again.    And then, you should go to el Guero Canelo and get the best Sonoroan hotdog ever.
0810993139|5.0|This is the funniest book for kids since Captain Underpants - but for their older siblings.  Even our 8th graders thought it was hilarious.
B000ICLRIE|5.0|This movie is even better with the 50 mins of added scenes. It feels like a whole different movie. And the picture and sound quality is amazing. Some of the best on high def and blu-ray. Blu-ray really is better then HD-DVD.
B0001AP12G|5.0|Let me start off by saying I am not a fan of rap or hip hop at all.  I think 99% of it is total crap and I never liked it.  I am 43 years old and a music fanatic.  I own about 1,000 CD's and I love all types of music (except most Rap & Country music).  With that being said, Kanye West is a musical genious and this CD is phenomenal.  His lyrics are witty and the music is very uplifting.  It always puts me in a great mood!  I own all 3 of his CD's and they are all great.  This one or Graduation are his best.  Even if you don't like rap music, give this one a try because it is great.  HIGHLY recommended.
B000063UR1|5.0|This film is a product of its era. It has effects that were state of the art in 1973, a sound track by PDQ Bach and Joan Baez and a story line about the results of guilt, loneliness and isolation, about being in a \\"no win\\" situation and having to betray yourself by action, or by inaction and the results that such a choice will have on a person.    Lots of snide comments are made about this film, and it will certainly not appeal to everyone. It is not action driven and the main conflict is internal to Dern's character. If you want a film that dwells on how pretty it can be watch something else. If you want to see action watch the first Star Wars. If you want to see a film that for a tiny budget and shot in 30 days actually has some guts to say something about how we treat our resources and how we treat ourselves; about how sometimes choices we make for love can be just as damaging to us as ones made for other reasons, how sometimes the choices we have before us lead to nowhere except our own destruction, but that maybe even with all that something \\"not replacable\\" can still be salvaged watch this film.
0061122416|5.0|A beautiful journey.  Follow your dreams, and listen to your heart, understand the language of the world, recognize the omens.  This is an omen.  ;)
B000VBJEEG|1.0|I can safely say that I've seen well over 1,000 moving pictures in my years and I've had a lot of different responses to each and every one; some have left me baffled either with their genius or their idiocy, some have left me in chills and some have left me completely numb and utterly bleak.<br /><br />BUT Pixar Disney's latest installment in animated banality actually managed to make me vomit it was so bad.  Seriously, the film ended, and I was so overcome with anger at it's sheer stupidity and absolute lack of humor that I retched up some of my dinner.  Congratulations.<br /><br />The general population really is full of nitwits if trash like this can flourish as well as it has.<br /><br />Toy Story was absolutely magnificent, everything after that has been total tripe.
032147404X|5.0|I really enjoyed this book. It's informative but fun. Scott Kelby has got a great sense of humor and his writing style reflects that.
B000H0MKGK|4.0|November 2005 was when I became a full-blown Mayer-holic. I driving my brother's car downtown, trying to find a parking space while he bought his iPod, and \\"St. Patrick's Day\\" was playing. I almost hit a car that day. I also put that song on repeat for about 30 minutes.<br /><br />Continuum is in my opinion, one of the top 5 albums of 2006, crossing all genres. I wasn't really sold, per se, on 'Waiting on the World to Change' upon listening to it when it was released as a single. I thought it was okay, but nothing special. Nonetheless, I bought the album for myself around Christmastime. I had listened to it on [...] the week it came out [thank God for their free listening parties!], and I remember loving the whole album. This was also before I started downloading albums, so the wait was verrry long, but worth every day.<br /><br />John, unfortunately, always has at least one or two songs on his albums that I utterly can't stand [on Heavier Things, it was \\"New Deep\\" and \\"Only Heart,\\" and on Room for Squares it was \\"No Such Thing.\\"]; with this album, it is DEFINITELY \\"Belief.\\" It has a good message, but I think very poor execution in terms of production, etc. But of all the John Mayer albums, this is by far my FAVORITE. It's a very personal album, and besides \\"Belief,\\" there is seriously not one track I skip.<br /><br />My personal favorites are \\"Slow Dancing in a Burning Room\\" [which almost made me cry when I heard it the first time], \\"Gravity,\\" \\"Vultures,\\" and \\"Stop This Train.\\" He has definitely grown as a musician, and this album evokes emotions for all lovers of music--good, great, unadulterated MUSIC.
B00005JPRF|2.0|this movie was a little on the corny side to me! the only thing i liked about this movie is how all of the original characters from part two all died! other then that............i wish i could get my money back from the movie ticket!
B000VL9XE2|4.0|If you were to take a look at my past reviews and judge what music I generally like based on them, you'd be incredibly surprised that I really enjoy Dillinger Escape Plan. Whether it's their undeniable ability to craft the most intricate music on the planet, or the fact that they tap into the most primal urge to throw restraint to the wind and rock out; Dillinger has had me since I first listened to their stuff several years ago. Miss Machine, was my introduction to the band. The album's more accessible moments (\\"Unretrofied\\" or \\"Phone Home\\") are originally what drew me in. Before I knew it, I was a full blown fan, picking up Calculating Infinity and scouring their numerous EPs for other great material. I am pleased to say Ire Works continues the bands tradition of making great music.<br /><br />For those worried that the departure of drummer Chris Pennie would spell the end for the band's complex percussion, shame on you. You should know better. Despite this unfortunate event, the addition of Gil Sharone to the band changed absolutely nothing about the Dillinger's sound. Never is this more apparent than on \\"Fix Your Face\\" the album's strong, in-your-face opener. Greg's vocals are intimidating as ever, growling out \\"You were young and now you pay the price for her, price for her,\\" with unparalleled force. \\"Lurch\\" seems to follow the same theme, lyrically, as the first song. Greg's ranting about a \\"little starlet\\" is haunting, and the guitars are all over the place as usual. It's amazing!<br /><br />\\"Black Bubblegum\\" is the first \\"singing\\" song on the album, in the vein of \\"Unretrofied.\\" It took a few listens before I started to like it. Greg enters a high falsetto several times throughout the course of the song, and hearing him sing \\"I had gotten frozen by the way you walked, by the love you gave, by the look on the face,\\" is jarring simply because it seems completely uncharacteristic. The chorus completely washes away any doubt though, and should hopefully have the same effect on other skeptical listeners. The song is followed by \\"Sick on Sunday,\\" a 2 minute song whose first 1:20 is mostly just filler. It doesn't really satisfy on any level.<br /><br />\\"When Acting as a Particle\\" is just over a minute long, and while it could be labeled as filler as well, I've found it much more interesting and worthwhile. This instrumental song creeps up with chimes and violins before implementing the drums, all the while changing what is going on behind them. It's short, but interesting. \\"Nong Eye Gong\\" picks things back up again, if only for a brief moment. Despite it's brevity, I've found it to be one of my favorite tracks on the album. It's bookended by yet another instrumental, \\"When Acting as a Wave,\\" which is also incredibly impressive. This time the band ditches the creepy vibe in favor of what feels like a jam session with a little production flare, including some electronic stutters. It all sounds great.<br /><br />The album continues to impress from here. \\"82588\\" finds Greg reflecting on a fallen angel, crying \\"You were never a saint but now you're a sin, spoiled rotten from within. Who clipped your wings? Cut them yourself?\\" \\"Milk Lizard\\" brilliantly makes use of subtle brass instrumentation during the verses. The chorus leaves a lot to be desired, however, and at times I thought I was listening to Finger Eleven because the music was so easy and Greg's vocals sounded surprisingly similar to Scott Anderson's. Fortunately, \\"Party Smasher\\" does a fairly decent job of reminding me who I'm listening to again, sounding more like old-school Dillinger than any other song on the album.<br /><br />\\"Dead as History\\" marks the first time that the band crosses the 5-minute mark, but the first 2 minutes serve only as a cool, but largely unnecessary introduction. Another accessible song, this one is breathtaking from start to finish. The production of the song is incredible, with little blips and beeps scattered throughout and an enchanting synth line following the second chorus. The song ends with Greg harmonizing with himself in a choir-like manner over a soft, complementing piano. It's the most different song Dillinger has ever made, and I love every minute of it. \\"Horse Hunter\\" is another fabulous song. Though more traditional, hearing Greg scream \\"Commerce is your god, cannibalistic flies, monarch of your womb, messiah of your thighs\\" at the top of his vocal register is just as amazing as anything in the song it follows.<br /><br />Long-time fans may be turned off by the album's closer, \\"Mouth of Ghosts.\\" You wouldn't think of Dillinger being able to pull of a Latin-jazz infused rock song, but that's exactly what they do here. The first 4 1/2 minutes lead you to believe that this song is the traditional comedown track, but it soon evolves into another brilliant example of how Dillinger can take one song and turn it into something completely different. He may begin the song singing, \\"Our trust runs out tonight,\\" but by the end he's screaming \\"You were a mouth without a heart\\" with everything he has. It is a fantastic song and the end to a very strange journey of an album.<br /><br />By the time your CD resets and you're hearing \\"Fix Your Face\\" again, you'll be utterly amazed that you're listening to the same band. I was! Long-time fans of Dillinger Escape Plan, and fans of grind and hardcore music in general may be turned off by the lighter moments of Ire Works, but hopefully the moments where the band turns everything up to 11 and rocks out will make up for that. Personally, I love almost every second of this album and I'm thrilled to add it to my collection of Dillinger records. I highly recommend it to fans and non-fans alike.

B0000399WI|5.0|Note: Some immature Mormon has been slamming my reviews because I wrote some negative reviews of books attempting to defend the Book of Mormon.<br /><br />So your \\"helpful\\" votes are greatly appreciated. A short review is not necessarily a bad review if it leads you to a great movie. I've just noted the general theme. Thanks<br /><br />I hesitated to see this movie because I don't care for prison shows, but at last I rented it. Wow, what a powerful drama. It grabbed me and wouldn't let go. With terrific acting and a compelling plot, you are caught up in the life of an innocent man accused of murder and sent to the notorious \\"Shawshank\\" prison in Maine.<br /><br />This is the kind of movie that you will walk away from feeling inspired about the determination of human beings not only to survive but to triumph.<br /><br />Read my short review, then see the movie. Save the longer reviews until after. I hope I've written enough to plant the hook. Like me, you will wonder why you hesitated on this movie.
B000001F76|5.0|In March of 1947 Hank Williams signed with MGM Records, and released his first hit single 'Move It On Over' shortly thereafter. Well, here we are in 2007 and his music is as much or more appreciated today than it was when it was released 60 years ago. His music laid the foundation for a musical legacy that is still being built to this day.<br /><br />Like many I suppose, I was introduced to the Williams' musical legacy via Hank Williams Jr., in the late 70s in my case. And while I enjoy some of Jr.'s songs, like 'Whiskey Bent And Hell Bound' for instance, as a whole Jr. is just not my cup of coffee.<br /><br />I don't really know when I became aware of the existence of Hank Williams III; sometime in the early 00s I suppose. However, I never took the time or felt the need to investigate III, given that Jr. didn't really do all that much for me, but more so because I'm just not a big fan of Country music, never have been. I am however a fan of Rock, Metal and even some extreme Metals. Consequently, in 2004 I was reminded of III's existence through his Rock/Metal projects; 'III & Assjack' and 'Superjoint Ritual'. However, in my opinion Hank III's excursions into Rock/Metal have to date produced mediocre results at best. But because of his Rock/Metal forays I decided that maybe I should check out some of III's Country music. Well, what a great surprise, now we've got something, III's Country music is really good! And my liking his Country music was a bit surprising given that I don't care for Country music, but III's music is not your typical present-day Country music, it is in large part reminiscent of his Grandfather's music.<br /><br />I found it somewhat odd and interesting that III obviously found more inspiration in his Grandfather's music than his Father's music. So, this left only one logical thing for me to do; spend some time and check out Hank Sr.'s music. Of course I'd already heard 'Your Cheatin' Heart', 'I'm So Lonesome' and 'Cold, Cold Heart', so I had a good idea of what he was about, but WOW, he has so much more great material. Sr.'s music is inspired, and is in my opinion clearly the most compelling of the three Williams boys. That is in no way meant to devalue the other two, but Sr.'s music is on a whole different plane. Sr.'s music conveys emotion which you know comes from a genuine place, you know that his music is pure and real. Hell, the man drank himself to death at the age of 29, and I don't think you can do that without being tortured by a few demons. I've often said that the tortured artist is almost without exception the most prolific, inspired, creative and brilliant. Hank Sr. is an unfortunate but prime example of that.<br /><br />Well, all of this got me to thinking; given that I don't like Country music, why do I find Sr.'s music so endearing? It's simple I suppose, Sr. is PURE Country. It is not the same music that people today are calling Country music. Sr.'s music is totally unbastardized, it is Country music before subsequent generations took it and diluted it with other influences resulting in a pallid concoction that barely resembles what it once was. And this brings me to why I also like III's music. While it's not totally pure like Sr.'s, it's also not that far removed, and it's about as close to real Country as you are going to get from a present-day artist. Don't get me wrong, I do find some value in modern Country, as I would plow Twain and Hill from now till Christmas, but that is where my interest in modern Country terminates. And if you happen to be like me and think that Country music is primarily for the NASCAR set, you might be surprised by the contents of this compilation. Hank Williams Sr. is a warmly welcomed addition to my music collection, and I'm pretty certain that you'll feel the same way.good idea of what he was about, but WOW, he has so much more great material.

B00000DOZV|4.0|This album is one of two Genesis released in 1976. Unfortunately, it didn't recieved the success that it truly deserved. Trick of the tail was not nearly as put together and as good as The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway was, it probably could have been shortened. Too many bands durng the 70's and 80's were trying to hard to come out with multiple disk albums. The overall quality suffered. Not was the case with this great post Peter Gabriel album.

B000Y179KO|5.0|I don't understand why people are taking off stars because it would have made a better single album.  Even if some songs are mediocre, it costs the same as a single album. If they had cut 5 or so songs from it and made it a single album, everyone would be loving it. But they add a few mediocre ones and still charge the same price, and it loses points?
0789208547|5.0|This book is massive! Geesh, I wasn't expecting quite this and was pleasantly surprised. I'm very happy with this purchase, and kudos to Amazon for getting it to me a day before the estimated time it was to arrive! It came in this huge US postal bag and...it was just fantastic. Very exciting and I look forward to having a good look at it soon. I highly recommend this book to anyone. It's the definitive Norman Rockwell.

1416914285|1.0|After all the hype, I decided to buy the book used and give it a try.  I found it to be a complete waste of money and the time it took to read.  The writing and characters were terrible: unimaginative, uninspired, boring.  I couldn't bring myself to care about any of the characters. Nor did I enjoy the fact that they keep changing physical characteristics without reason or explanation.  Was this book edited at all?  The plot followed such a highly predictable pattern I really didn't need to finish reading the book.  Contradicts itself too often, stale, and unoriginal in the extreme.  This isn't the worst book I've ever read, but it's in the top 10.
B000WCDI5K|4.0|You know how it is- Target has one bonus track on an album, Best Buy has a different one and then there are those songs you can only get from an import single. It's so hard to get your hands on those b-side songs.  The Killers really gave us fans a nice treat with compiling all these tracks on one album.  For me, it was important not to have my expectations set too high, as these songs are essentially leftovers from their other albums, predominantly at least. Still, most of the tracks on here, a few fillers aside, are outstanding and original. It's fun to see that The Killers were a bit more experimental with their sound and genre this time.  Overall, definitely worth the purchase!  My favorite songs are Tranquilize, All The Pretty Faces and the live version of Sam's Town which is amazing!
B000VZBCWE|5.0|I've listened to the Rock Montreal concert and noticed how they cleaned up a few mistakes from the WWRY DTS version like the sour guitar note in Somebody to love during the \\"work till' I ache my bones\\" part etc. Also, the video seems to match the sound this time around(two nights were shot and often one video was substituted for the others sound and vice versa). I also noticed the overall mix on Rock Montreal has less midrange than the prior WWRY and sounds slightly more clean and less angry/raw which is a good and bad thing. It definitely sounds cleaned up though.<br /><br />However certain things didn't sound as good, like the \\"thunderstorm intro\\". I always used to stick the prior WWRY disc in to show off my sound system to friends, and the new version lacks the intensity of the sound of the prior release. It sounds so much more intense on the WWRY DTS version because that mix cleverly makes much more use of the rear surrounds which create this *big* atmosphere/ambiance for the bands grand entrance. Instead, they chose to mix the crowd noise in the rear surrounds. Try to A/B both disc if you have them and you will see what I mean. I guess this was done to be more realistic from a concert seat standpoint(band- front speakers, crowd- rear speakers). I should mention that the sequences done with delay(or echo) do make use of the surrounds.<br /><br />I believe the drums are mixed a little bit louder on the newer release and they sound very good. The guitar is low at points like on the lead on the fast version of WWRY, but the fading of the guitar volume up and down found on the prior release seems more cleaned up on Rock Montreal. Less of a swishing sound.<br /><br />I liked the commentary by Roger and Brian as well. It's not overly entertaining, but it's quite informative at times. Queen fans will enjoy it, but the average person would probably find it boring due to a few gaps in commentary.<br /><br />This probably is my favorite live dvd release though, especially since it lack the snyths found on the later releases, and doesn't have any additional players. I think more could have been done with the surround mix, but this is probably the best one out right now. If your looking to buy your first live Queen dvd, this one is probably the best. If you have WWRY DTS, this isn't all that different and might want to rent it first. If you have the original VHS or DVD(not DTS), you will enjoy this one much more. Plus this one has the bonuses of Brian/Roger commentary and Live Aid.<br /><br />I rented this first since I already own the WWRY DTS, but the bonuses alone make this worth buying, not to mention the cleaned up audio.d on the later releases, and doesn't have any additional players.

B000VLE3GA|5.0|This is a generous sampling of the most famous and thunderous songs in the Zeppelin catalog. You've got Communication Breakdown, Whole Lotta Love, Heartbreaker, Immigrant Song, Black Dog, Rock and Roll, Achilles' Last Stand, and of course, Stairway to Heaven.     Another great thing about this double cd set is the outstanding remastered sound. The collection is a must buy for Zeppelin fans for no other reason than this.    The two comments that I have by way of criticism are that a. Led Zeppelin was more of an album band than a singles band. The songs on the original albums had a sequencing and a flow that was intoxicating and purposeful. Also, this collection doesn't give enough space to the folkier side of Led Zeppelin - no Tangerine or Gallows Pole or Bron Y Aur Stomp or Black Mountain Side or Going to California or Battle of Evermore.     I also wish that Dancing Days and Fool in the Rain would have been included.    But still, this is the best sounding Led Zeppelin collection money can buy. Hopefully, after listening to these songs, you'll want to download their studio albums.
B000VL9XE2|3.0|I hate to break it to you mister Dave Klein, but the album of the year honor went to Between The Buried And Me for \\"Colors\\" on August 25, 2007, almost a month before it was even officially released.  I'm all for bands taking their music in a different direction and I hate to say this, but I almost feel as though Dillinger has made their \\"Black Album\\" so to speak in that it really doesn't sound a whole lot like Dillinger.  It sounds like a heavier version of Trent Reznor and Nine Inch Nails (they obviously have found some inspiration from them somehow).  Where \\"Colors\\" was unmistakably BTBAM, the band also pushed the boundaries of what had become their signature sound, while still progressing and expanding their influences even further to create something entirely different altogether and even ultimately superior to anything else they had done before.  However, this is not the case with Dillinger.  I'm not saying they've lost their technical skills per se, but let's face it, there are no \\"holy $hit\\" moments like 43% burnt for instance (a classic in mathcore by the way).  So this album, while still being good for what it is, just does not resonate with me as much as any of Dillinger's previous works, thus I can only give it 3 stars as it does not impress me in the same way.
075640407X|5.0|This book was excellent.      Now that I have finished it, and I am taking an objective step back I'm able to see that the plot, although clever and interesting, did not break new ground in the genre.  The characters are familiar.  The villains felt a bit like the Forsaken of Robert Jordan.      If the book were any less well-written this would have detracted greatly from my enjoyment.    However, Patrick Rothfuss handled everything with great skill.  In his hands, rather stereotypical characters became burnished archetypes.  His plot was not rushed, but instead lovingly detailed.  His language was lush and clean.  His magic system was quite clever.  The book he wrote is the ideal towards which every other fantasy writer of this particular subgenre strives.      This is not a ground-breaker.  But, this is the kind of book that reminds you why you got hooked on Epic Fantasy in the first place.
184195425X|3.0|An interesting and mildly intriguing tale, rich in religious/spiritual symbolism.  I've read better and have read worse.  Personal injury Patel is shipwrecked on a lifeboat with a Bengal Tiger.  What follows is a fantastic tale of survival and borders on the surreal.  The narrative is slow-paced and at times taxed the patience of this reader.  The end of the book offers alternative survival narratives of the protagonist.      I had heard the book hyped so much that in my mind, the actual reading did not live up to the hype.      Are we all on a life boat seeking survival, meaning and love?  PI offers lots for reflection and discussion

0380799006|4.0|I thought this book was helpful in shedding light on what is truly going on between siblings. While the concepts to be applied are simple, I found it very helpful to understand the underlying thoughts of the kids. It includes some very basic parenting techniques that really do work! I've found that my 5-year-old responds well to some of the techniques suggested. However, my 2-year-old isn't yet to that level of understanding. So, I've found it beneficial with my older child, and I'm sure my son will catch up once he's a bit older. Overall, I really liked the book.
B000J233SK|4.0|I happened upon Loreena McKennitt's music purely by accident - a very happy accident indeed. One listen to the song 'The Mummers' Dance' and I was as good as a fan. After failing to find her albums in any music stores, I ordered 'The Book of Secrets' online. Quite a hasty decision by my standards, but I had to have it.    'The Book of Secrets' has a wonderfully rich sound, drawing musical influences from many eras and cultures, and the result works incredibly well: a pigeonhole-defying blend of folk, New Age, Celtic and world music with an occasional Renaissance twist. Though the comparisons to Enya are frequent, Loreena McKennitt is quite a different artist in my eyes. Loreena's work is darker, deeper, more poetic and complex - though I'm a great fan of Enya, her music seems like frivolous, fluffy ear-candy in comparison. This artist is almost in a genre of her own.    If you're expecting an album of upbeat Mummers' Dances (which I confess I was) you may be initially disappointed, but after a couple of listens I appreciated it more. From the exotic rhythms of 'Marco Polo' to the haunting ballad 'Dante's Prayer', there's not one weak track on here. Other favourites include the touching, melancholy 'Skellig', the beautiful harp instrumental 'La Serenissima', and Ms McKennitt's adaptation of the tragic poem 'The Highwayman' by Alfred Noyes.    'The Book of Secrets' isn't so much a series of songs as a musical journey across continents - lovingly made, life-affirming music, though I have little experience of McKennitt's previous work to say how it compares. A truly talented singer, songwriter and musician who deserves to be heard. Though her CDs are mind-bogglingly hard to find, it's worth the effort just to relax and soak in the sound. Recommended.
B000TEUCFA|1.0|Stacey Kent has as little to do with Jazz as Kenny G.  But Kenny G sells, yo, he SELLS.  And so does Stacey Kent - although her songs sound as shallow as the taste of a chewing gum that you've had in your mouth for half a day. You heard that stuff a thousand times without listening - so why buy such a CD? Go into a supermarket and listen, for a change, to that musical oil that you never payed attention to. Everything that is supposed to sound like Jazz and to sell, sounds like this. No, thanks.
B000TSIK14|5.0|Well...to be honest this is a more Herculean than merely human effort. How the Scorpions could make an album that sounds this fresh and relevant, and yet still retain that trademark classic sound they've been peddling for over 30 years...well...it's almost beyond human comprehension. Everyone's performance here is just spot-on. The songs are all memorable, and each one is either head-banging, toe-tapping, high drama, or an absorbing combination of all of the above. Truly...hope for all humankind, or at least \\"Rock `n' Roll!
B000CFLFX4|1.0|I bought this product because I live right on the beach and also have 2 small dogs so I usually have to sweep up at the end of every day.  I have tile floors, short carpet and hardwood flooring so when I saw the informercial, this product was for me.  When I first got it, I fought with others on who would to the sweeping.  Yes, sometimes it blows things around and sometimes static makes dust stick to it and yes when you clean it out each day after you are finished, you have to do a quick turn on/turn off to tidy up but none of this is horrible, actually it was sort of expected.  Well, it's now been a little over 3 months and I too am having all the problems I am now reading regarding the battery not holding it's charge.  If I don't leave the battery plugged into the wall at all times now until I want to use it, I get about 5 minutes of suction and then it starts dieing out.  I'm so sad.  When you look at how much the battery costs and replacing it every 3 months or so, well, it just isn't worth it so another swivel sweeper will meet the dump.  :(

B000MRAAJM|5.0|I received Planet Earth as gift and I must say its amazing.  If you want test your system and see one of the most impressive nature/documentary series to date then I would definitely pick this up.  BTW the version I own is with narration by David Attenborough not Sigourney Weaver so I am not sure if there is any difference between the two.

0525950079|2.0|It causes great pain when the over-arching theme of a historical novel is that its time period is in almost all ways inferior to the contemporary one. Ken Follett achieves this --- and creates a flaccid novel in the process --- by tirelessly relenting the \\"unfairness\\" foisted upon his heroes by one-dimensional villains who represent the \\"obviously backward\\" Middle Ages. When coupled with the soap-opera-quality drama, the novel is perfectly readable and enjoyable, but immature.    Set two centuries after Follett's bestselling THE PILLARS OF THE EARTH in the same town of Kingsbridge, WORLD WITHOUT END tracks the development of its five principle characters from youth to adulthood. Each is thrusted into a different social role, and the many dramas of this 1,000-page text all stem from their struggles in growth.     But their lives are shaped just as much by their limited characterization as by their limited roles in society. The boy to become a nobleman, a bastion of medieval repression, is of course stupid, quick to anger, and a heartless brute, all apparent even at the age of ten. The monk, son of a scheming woman, who intends to be prior of the town (another symbol of medieval oppression), is a guileful schemer himself without any regard for the lives of others. These main villains of the novel never show any real sense of growth or internal conflict. They are essentially nothing but evil, about as sympathetic as an insidious Fu Manchu.    Follett's heroes fare somewhat better. Gwenda is struggling to not be a landless, always-tired laborer like her parents, and is inoffensively hard-working. Merthin and Caris, the main characters and the main romantic story, are actually fleshed out people full of conflicts with themselves, each other, and their society, something of paramount importance in a novel whose structure is portraying conflict to document growth. But even here the characterizations are flawed due to bland simplifying. Merthin is an architect, whose innovative brilliance is of course repeatedly ignored by town conservatives. Caris's personality essentially feels like that of a modern woman with modern sensibilities, not that of a woman struggling against a narrow-minded society. She feels out of place, too much like the creation of an author with practically no sympathy for the Middle Ages. While these characters do experience amounts of growth, they are more reminiscent of abstract heroes than human individuals. The rest of the characters can often be summed up as one-liners: \\"the stupid, mean suck up,\\" \\"the gentle giant,\\" \\"the powerful, forward-thinking realist,\\" etc.    This is not to say that Follett has to entirely like the 14th century. He's right in all of his blatant criticisms of medieval society: monopolizing guilds limit the free flow of ideas; conservative religious institutions may hinder social progress; monks who take a vow of poverty and live in palaces are hypocrites; serfs should not have to devote their lives to their lords; and medicinal science is best served by empirical observation rather than adherence to ancient theory. No modern reader can really find any fault with this battery of criticisms. But in a work of historical fiction, where the past is supposed to be able to speak up for itself, Follett imposes his harshly modern opinions on the 14th century, and gives the past no defense at all. Not only is this an example of flat writing, it further harms the text by oscillating between boring and annoying. WORLD WITHOUT END fails to create the atmosphere of another world; at best, it creates a modern author's impoverished representation of how \\"unfair\\" the Middle Ages could be.    The crippled characterization and setting is well matched by the clownish drama. There is no real over-arching plot; instead there are many interlocking and overlapping episodes, in which an always-in-the-right hero struggles against an invariably evil institution, villain, or convention. The instances of actualizedhuman drama are few by comparison. These episodes are certainly readable (though some feel simply ridiculous), and the more interesting ones are even compelling; this simple entertainment value rescues the novel from utter failure and shall carry it quite far. But from a literary standpoint, they are mostly trite and predictable. This is not the stuff of good historical fiction.    This novel is bound to receive immensely positive press. It certainly has an amount of entertainment value, but fails to achieve the heights ascribed to it. Instead of a round portrait of real individuals in another age, Follett has given us tired frustration.
0143038419|5.0|This is a book I almost didn't read.  However, three times in one day, it was presented to me so I bought it and fell in love the the story.  I was sad when the story ended and miss reading about her journey.  Very well written with humor and insight.  Can't wait to see her next work.  Trish, Daphne, Alabama
B000H6SXMY|5.0|What can I say. I think it is the best sitcom. Ten seasons passed like one day.  This edition comes with nice box. Discs inside six books. Strange decision to insert discs into hard paper books without any soft material. Scratches guaranteed unless you buy some soft envelopes or insert discs in other cases.  But I think this is insignificant fault for that price and for that great show.
1592332803|5.0|First of all, the book is beautiful. The photographs are very enticing and the recipes are well written and easy to follow. I tried the chocolate macaroons first and found them to be a bit too sweet for my taste, so I will adjust the sweetener next time. The cinnamon coffee cake was a big hit at my office. I tackled the chocolate mousse and the chocolate chip cookies this weekend and both were delicious and very well received by my guests. I was particularly impressed with the creaminess and richness of the mousse. The book also has good info about vegan ingredients and veganism in general, without being preachy.
B000VL9XE2|1.0|What happens when you take a band who has a style of music all their own and ask them to create a new album, but you don't want them to make the music all sound the same? (This is regardless of memeber changes) They needed to create a sound that was different because the chaotic, complex DEP of the past could not be repeated in the future. DEP created some of the best progressive music I have ever heard, but if they did this album in the same style they would become boring to listen to because it honestly starts to sound the same anyway. Ire Works was a progression of music that really had gone as far as it could go. Fix your Face is a good track, but it follows the Dillinger of old. Then there is Black Bubblegum...... WHAT THE @#$#! Seriously... There is no defending that song, the vocals are terrible and it is a freaking pop song. My hats off to Chris Pennie for leaving, I would rather buy the new Coheed album and that is something I never thought I'd say.  BEST ALBUM OF THE YEAR... More like the most dissapointing, but it's okay.. they went through alot of member changes
B000MNP2KI|1.0|A truly awful movie. Bond movies succeed when they have an elegant hero, with an understandable plot. This movie requires an understanding of stock market puts, which is hardly common knowledge. The heroine commits suicide for no apparent reason; granted, often the Bond girl dies, but usually by murder, not by suicide. Mindless, extend violence scenes.
B000OLGCI4|5.0|It's always a treat when Disney reissues and revamps the old classics.  Jungle Book is no exception.  The hand-drawn animation, in my opinion, blows away today's impersonal computer-generated images.  The attention to detail and the care which goes into every frame make this a joy to watch.  And the wonderful songs and classic story make Jungle Book a treasured addition to any home video library.
B000RC2EH8|5.0|I'm very happy i bought this film on HD-DVD.  When i saw it in theatres the babies crying kind of hurt the experience.  Now i get to see it just as if not more beautifully then when i saw it in the theatre.  Great movie as well even for a big kid like me (25)
B000KC8O3S|5.0|Bravo! Encore!<br /><br />I bought this soundtrack to have a nice piece of Doctor Who memorabilia, since some things are kind of rough to find here in the States and you have to snap them up while they're available. But I have to say, this is a really beautiful CD! To hear the incidental music independent from the show gave me a new appreciation for the series as a whole and all of the elements it takes to bring our favorite Time Lord's adventures to life (how many of us have been enraptured by a scene and enthralled by the sights AND sounds?), and for Murray Gold as a composer. His compositions are quite remarkable and layered; not to mention thrilling.<br /><br />\\"The Face of Boe\\" and \\"The Doctor's Theme\\" are exceptionally haunting, even though they're short - just under two minutes. \\"Doomsday\\" brings back every bit of sadness and remorse as Rose is separated from the Doctor forever. That scene is played out in melodic melancholy with this track; but it's a fabulous, bass-driven piece that will send a chill down your spine if you are a true fan of the series.<br /><br />I guess I never really gave much thought to the incidental music of a TV show, but I have a new appreciation for it. This soundtrack brings alive some favorite moments, but the music itself is simply enjoyable to listen to. And as a writer, it's the perfect music to have playing whilst writing.
B000001GQJ|5.0|I had high expectations for this CD, and it exceeded them!  Martha Argerich played with passion, precision, and amazing technique.  I was absolutely dazzled, and would recommend it to anyone who likes classical piano music.
0061125237|5.0|Four kids Lucy, Susan, Peter, and Edmund, go in to another world through a wardrobe. This world is called Narnia. The kids fight the white witch, side by side, with the mighty lion, ASLAN.<br /> My favorite part was when the white witch shaved, chained, and killed Aslan on the stone table. The white witch thought that she had won. Then the stone table broke in half and Aslan... well, I guess you will have to read the book.<br /> I love the book and I love the movie. The book was so good. I don't like many books I read, so I was surprised to find a book I can read over and over again. I totally recommend this book because it through your emotions around, you are happy, sad, you cry, you laugh, and you fall in love with some characters. It is just a great book. People of all ages, should read or listen to this wonderful story.

B000000H5K|4.0|I believe this was one of the best metal album of the 90's.  Sepultura are much more influential the they are given credit.  Finally there was a band that used the heavy death metal sound with lyrics with actual meaning rather than just relying on shock value.  I'm not saying the lyrics were splitting the atom but they were much more mature than what death/black metal had been doing for the last 10 years.  The funny thing is when I first heard Roots I did not realize they were the same band that I had read about in the mid 80's who were said to have a sound similar to the great Celtic Frost.  If you love heavy music and have not listened to Sepultura than buy this cd.
B000MV9026|5.0|My family, and I loved this movie. We've seen it now a few times. My daughter loves to get up and dance along with the songs.  The music in this movie is incredible, and very creatively put together. The story is cute, and Robin Williams, who I normally am not a huge fan of, is hillarious in this movie. The ending is a little far fetched and strangely unbelievable but heh it's a kids movie. I found it very amusing, and I especially like how it gets children loving penguins and dancing along. N-Ice Job
B00003CXB4|5.0|great movie.  i consider this to be one of the best carton movie ever produced.  great theme. children love to watch it.
B000DWMYQ8|2.0|This movie came highly recommended to me and my family.  We shut it off after 25 minutes, collectively bored and unhooked. I, myself, was quite irritated with the voices.  The animation was incredible, and very creative. There were a lot of cool ideas going on in the town. However, as I mentioned before, the voices were very annoying. It didn't make sense. The animal children had voices of adults. ANd the father of Chicken Little had the voice of an extremely elderly man. It didn't make any sense.  My daughter was bored and asking for the \\"Witch Movie\\" aka \\"The Wizard of Oz\\" so we gladly put that on for her. Imagine that, a toddler today wanting a movie from 1939 instead of this. That says something.   There are some cute and fun parts to this movie, however overall it just doesn't hold the interest of a child or an adult. The action sequences were so boring we fast forwarded through them. Imagine that. The animation is good, the story and characters are bad.
B000NA28I4|2.0|There's two ways to look at a movie based on a book. One is to hope it really does justice to the fine writing in the book, and brings that vision to life. The other is to completely ignore the book and hope that the movie simply is a great movie, loosely based on a book text.<br /><br />To review Eragon fairly, my boyfriend and I took two different points of view. I read the book first, so I would judge the movie against the book. He did NOT read the book first, so he could watch the movie without any bias.<br /><br />We both thought the movie did a VERY poor job.<br /><br />Let's look at why. Interestingly, the things he laughed at, I laughed at as well. Probably the most key issue was the development of Saphira, the dragon. In the book, Ergaon builds a meaningful relationship with her over time. He learns about her, she learns about him, they grow to care for each other. There are subtle interplays with Saphira's jealousy and love for him. Out of all of the book's substance, this is probably the best done, and the key for the story.<br /><br />To me, the \\"five second explosion\\" where Saphira morphs from a gremlin-like baby dragon into a full grown dragon was ABSOLUTELY ridiculous. It killed much of the meaning of the story. Interestingly, Bob (my boyfriend) found this morph equally ridiculous. Even without having read the book, he could clearly see that this was wrong.<br /><br />So many of the movie's scenes and dialogue are stolen from other movies that it was hard to count them all. The one in particular that had us both rolling on the ground with laughter was when Luke Skywalker (oh sorry, I mean Eragon) was wistfully looking off into the sunset as the music swelled. We kept looking for that second sun of Tattoine. Could you have been more obvious there?<br /><br />There were sections of dialogue where I literally could recite the words along with the characters, even though they weren't in the book. The things they said were THAT predictable.<br /><br />With really well written books, like Lord of the Rings or Harry Potter, the set designers would keep copies of the book on set, referring to them page by page to ensure they had the details exactly right. JK Rowlings was called in frequently when the first Harry Potter book was made into a movie, to ensure that the costumes and environments were perfect.<br /><br />In comparison, you have to wonder if the movie makers here even read the book. The things they \\"got wrong\\" are staggering. Yes, you could say that the book was very flawed to begin with and that they were trying to \\"fix\\" it. But if that were the case, they would have improved on the book. Instead, even the important parts of the book are lost completely - and the thievery involved in the movie is almost even more blatant than what the book held.<br /><br />I'm not saying that the book was without flaws. For example, one serious issue for me was that the only real female character - the elf, Arya - was comatose for 99% of the book. In the movie, Arya is much more talkative. You could say they \\"changed the book here\\" - but to me it was like enhancing Arwen and Eowyn's part in the Lord of the Rings movies. The book had a flaw, and they fixed it. To me that's a healthy change. Of course, they somehow turned Arya from an elf into a human, but that was minor compared to other issues.<br /><br />In general, the damage the movie plot wrought was far more severe. They destroyed Eragon's relationship with Saphira. They destroyed much of the meaning of Brom's mentorship, and of Murtagh's friendship. The variety of villager issues between Eragon and various people was simplified to \\"everyone is scared of the Evil Empire\\".<br /><br />In the end, my boyfriend, who watched the movie \\"without prejudice\\" (i.e. no book knowledge) felt VERY disappointed by what it offered as a story. I, who HAD read the book first, felt equally disappointed with how it interpreted the book. Most movies at least either please the book readers orplease movie viewers. For a movie to fail on BOTH counts is quite an infamous achievement.please movie viewers. For a movie to fail on BOTH counts is quite an infamous achievement.
B000VI70WM|4.0|In spite of Timbaland/Timberlake's meddling, Red Carpet Massacre is Duran Duran's strongest outing since 1986's Notorious.  Lyrically and vocally, Simon has never sounded better and Nick's soundscapes provide the perfect backdrop to these tales of 21st century New Romanticism.  From the haunting arpeggios in the opening verse of The Valley to the chilling synth stabs of Last Man Standing, RCM flows with musical and vocal melodies only hinted at on 2004's satisfying, if not stellar, Astronaut.  The former, which is slightly reminiscient of Planet Earth, and the latter, which brings to mind Rio's The Chauffeur, are separated by ten near-masterpieces, each a standout in its own right.  The best of the lot (the title track, Falling Down, Box Full O' Honey, Zoom In and the aforementioned Last Man Standing) are the ones that seem to downplay the heavy Depeche Mode-esque rhythm loops and are allowed to breathe.  Even so, they merely hint at what might have been had the Timber-twins not seen fit to exile one Mr. Taylor...and no, I'm not talking about Andy.  While the long-haired Taylor's heavy metal crunch is sorely missed here, it's the apparent absence of Roger that leaves the biggest void...which is surprising since he is supposedly still in the band.  However, with nary a sixteenth note hi-hat to be found, one wonders how he might have kept the tempo while pounding on horrific-sounding snares and kicking bass drum beats that sound far less human than anything the Warren Cuccurullo-era Duran ever did...and repeated listens only serve to spark a doubt as to whether the other Mr. Taylor (John) is actually playing a real bass guitar.  It's a shame, really.  Had the rhythm section been allowed to, oh, I don't know, play rhythm, RCM might have been a Rio for this millenium.  As it is, the former fab 5 might at least be able to ride the Timber-wagon back into the top 40.  Guess if you look hard enough you can always find a (blue) silver lining.
B000I0RR76|5.0|This DVD is truely amazing. It not only contains a beautiful transfer of the original negative but also a plethora of special features that will satisfy even the most avid fan of 'The Adventures of Robin Hood'    This HD DVD sets a high bar, i hope other archive titles will be treated with equal reverence and attention.
B000VDDDVO|4.0|Just when I thought this release would finally give this classic movie the treatment it deserved, I was surprisingly suprised lastnight to come home, pop in the black and white disc and see that it is the exact same release as last year's 60th anniversary edition. For those who have complained about the 60th anniversary edition in the past, you may not be surprised to hear that Paramount has not gotten rid of that annoying Queen Latifa trailer when you first pop the DVD in. It's the exact disc in all actuallity. They just added a bonus disc, the colorized version, with no addition bonus features.    Now, I was very upset with this news. I was hoping there would finally be a DVD to accomidate the classic film appropriately and without commercialism to other Paramount movies and products. However, that day still has not come.    With my dissapointment with the packaging of this film, I still give the overall rating four stars based on the brilliance and beautifully done colorization on disc two. They definately spent some time and consideration in this new process as even the pictures of individuals around the living room and offices remain in black and white as they would have in real life. They get real detailed about what they're doing and do such a fine job of it, that at times (not all the time though) it appears as though the film was actually filmed in color. It's really something to see if you get your hands on it.

0805079831|3.0|When I first read this book, I have to be honest- I really did not like her perspective because immediately I saw that Klein associated free market economics with corporatism driven by Milton Friedman, the Chicago boys, the neocons, transnational industries, and Jeffrey Sachs. However, as I read the book I was impressed by her depth of knowledge of how the IMF, the World Bank, and USAID have been able to interfere in other countries so that transnational corporations can monopolize state assets whether it be in South America, South Africa, Sri Lanka, or Indonesia. These entities have been able to strong arm countries so that corporate entities can make a profit especially when it comes to \\"disaster capitalism\\". Personally, I prefer the term disaster corporatism. Whether you agree with her or not, her account of historical events dealing with corporatism is unparalleled. I applaud her in this effort.     Klein loses me from the onset though with the use of the term \\"disaster capitalism\\". Because the use of the term, I think she has either a misinformed interpretation of capitalism or a novice understanding of economics and if at all any understanding of monetary policy. She assumes that Keynesian economics was the driving force that lead us out of the Great Depression- it was not and many historians back this up. Instead, what happened was that the U.S. government via the Federal Reserve started pumping more money into the economy for the military industrial complex. Thus creating many wartime jobs. If anything at all, the Keynesian models she advocates were at most marginally successful during the Great Depression.     Secondly, I have to dispute Klein's use of the words capitalism and corporatism interchangibly. They are not the same though not mutually exclusive. Capitalism has to do with the free competitive exchange of goods, services, and ideas via a common currency. Whereas, corporatism does not allow for any competition- it colludes with governments, other powerful industries, and monopolizes an entire resource or resources to prevent free market competition serving only the interests of an elite few. More problematic, Klein suggests that free market capitalism has to do with neoconservatism- hardly and definitely not at all accurate.     Thirdly, Klein has harsh criticisms for Milton Friedman and Jeffrey Sachs. Her argument at most is tenuous but lacking any substantiative credence. With her harsh rebukes toward these distinguished academics, she does a great disservice to anyone who wants a basic understanding of economics. She indicates because Friedman's free market ideas and his collusion with big business or heads of state, this has created an environment for corporatism to thrive. Here is the flaw in this argument. To suggest a that an economist and heads of state are going to consult with each other- that is, ONE economist, for their economic plan is simply ludicrous and naive. If one wants a complete understanding of economic policy, one will see that most corporations and heads of state consult a variety of economic models and economists for their planning. Moreover, she fails to address that Friedman advocated for competitive enterprise and did not believe in monopolies- it was the state's responsibility to ensure free market competition. Milton argued if you wanted to get rid of elite financial interests, you needed to get rid of the Federal Reserve. Given this information, amazingly Klein even advocated for nationalizing banks! Furthermore, the national interests, i.e., World Bank, IMF, and USAID, hijacked Milton's economic models to serve their own interests. This is hardly any reason to accuse a noble laureate with collusion and corruption. It is like saying partly because of Christian principles, we went to war with Iraq. Therefore, we have to hold Christianity accountable. Anyone see the flaw in this logic?    As for Jeffrey Sachs, his involvement in Bolivia and Poland is indeed correct. But again, as above, his involvement was limited. And if anyone has read his book- The End of Poverty, he delineates his limited involvement in economic planning for these countries. What Klein failed to mention is that Dr. Sachs did indeed advocate for security/safety nets so that economies would not crash and would not fall victim to a powerful few. To suggest he was a 'corporatist' does a great disservice to the field of economics. I think she needs to realize that economists encompass a variety of models and ideas. They do not fit into one category as she suggests in her book. Instead, they extrapolate their own ideas from various macroeconomic models whether it be Keynesian, Friedman, or any other. And just like these models, governments all around the world consult many economists for domestic planning regardless if they are or are not getting monies from the IMF or the World Bank. Accusing Dr. Sachs and Milton Friedman with wrong doing though not having any substantial proof other than an ideology that was hijacked is either simply willfully deceptive or innocently malinformed.     Regardless of what I said above, I'd recommend this book to get a historical perspective that delineates the pitfalls and disasterous consequences of corporatism. It is quite good in this respect. However, to grasp an understanding of economics and how it has played itself out in the USA and around the world for the last 30-40 years, I would recommend you search elsewhere. It fails miserably. Klein has no understanding of economic principles whatsoever- an unfortunate consequence of distortion in my opinion.
0679720200|5.0|(Note: This is a review of Stuart Gilbert's translation)    I am not familiar with Albert Camus's work, but decided to read this. I was hooked from the beginning. Camus is very effective at instilling a sense of urgency and suspense. Throughout the novel, you feel helpless, nothing more than a passenger being driven toward the inevitable conclusion.     The main character is as much a victim of whimsy and circumstance as a willing participant in it. At times he seems like nothing more than a sentient animal, able to communicate with other people effectively, but unable (or unwilling) to emote. As I read, my mind became filled with questions. Is his condition the result of a mental handicap, or an innate acceptance of reality? Is it actually possible for someone to be like this? Was he always like this, or did something make him this way?    What's worse is the question I continually avoid: is he right?
B000002WPI|5.0|5/5    This may not be the most lyrical Wu album, but with timeless phrases like \\"my Clan is thick like plaster\\" and \\"if I die, My seed'll be ill like me,\\" it really doesn't need to be.  This album is every bit as gritty, rugged and raw, and hardcore as it proclaims to be.  The RZA's ingenious minimalist production gives every song the trifling feel of the hood.  It may not click after three or even four listens, but in due time the beats and the rhymes will mesh, and at that point it won't be hard for the listener to see why the 36 Chambers is considered a hip-hop masterpiece.

1416911049|5.0|I bought myself and my 13 year old sister a copy of this, we read it together. It was awesome. We couldn't put it down and would discuss each chapter as we went along. We couldn't wait to get the other books in the series and were disappointed when it ended. I'm looking for something else to spark her interest. It was so great to see her reading like that. Since she has really started reading a lot more, Steven King and such, I'm looking for something we can both enjoy together again. I loved this series.
0810993139|5.0|Reviewed by Connie Anderson    Subtitled: Greg Heffley's Journal-a novel in cartoon    My kid came home (okay, he's 31 and lives in NYC), and when he saw this book, he disappeared into his room with this New York Times Bestseller.    Now I've read it and the entire presentation is a hoot!    Hand-drawn cartoons with conversation balloons are all over the pages. Weird kids/adults are picture with odd characteristics-while popular ones are not. Hand-lettered copy appears neatly on wide-ruled (elementary school) line paper.    The book is written by a middle-school guy, so it's a journal-not a DIARY!-so no one gets the \\"wrong idea\\"-him writing down feelings and all that \\"stuff.\\"    Greg gives his point of view on some these middle-school challenges: - Where to sit in class.  - Sibling tricks (played on you).  - Which reading group he would belong to.  - Best friend.  - Back-up best friend.  - Popularity.  - Your image.  - Hanging out.  - Being talked to or yelled at by parent(s).    The diary (oops, journal) begins when school starts in fall and goes through the last day of school. Greg, the wimpy kid, deals with what to wear for Halloween, whether to try out for the school play or class officer, and advantages to being on the safety patrol.    Greg and his pal Rowley are always planning and cooking up ideas to get in or out of trouble. Greg, after his best friend was blamed for something that Greg actually did, says ... I knew I should set the record straight, but I just am not ready yet. I know if I confessed... (We all understand that quandary, don't we?)    The author is an online game developer and designer-who in his acknowledgements thanked a friend who wasn't afraid to tell him if a joke stunk. They don't. Such a true account of a kid struggling to fit in-and at the same time, and stand out but for the right reasons.    Armchair Interview says: If you are or ever were a middle-school boy, or you raised one, you'll relate to this most interesting point of view and fun presentation.
B0001XTIUO|5.0|It's not hard to see why 'Parallelograms' has developed a cult following.  It is a light, spacious record with a dark, surreal edge.  Joni Mitchell is the obvious reference point, but with a sinister psychedelic twist.  This comes across both in the lyrics and from the strange, unexpected musical breaks.    The song writing is consistent and varied, developing an ambiguous atmosphere that alternates between playful and haunting.  Upbeat tunes like 'Paper Mountain Man' fit perfectly next to the dreamlike title track.  The brilliant, 'Hey, Who Really Cares?' is the subtlest and most beautiful marriage of these elements, and the equal of anything Joni Mitchell ever recorded.
0312323867|5.0|New York Times Best-selling Author, Emily Griffin, recaptures the reality of life, love, and friendship in the sequel Something Blue. Something Blue focuses on Darcy Rhone, the selfish, vain, stunning, outgoing, life of the party whose charmed life comes crashing down by a big dose of reality. Something Blue begins by retelling the events of Griffin's first novel, Something Borrowed narrated by Rachel White, from the perspective of Darcy Rhone.      Darcy's best friend Rachel White is quiet and smart, but overall average. Darcy does not believe that Rachel could ever be up to her high standards, until Rachel does the unthinkable. To everyone's surprise Darcy has committed the same act that she hates Rachel for committing. The two best friends part ways over anger, betrayal, and love. Darcy makes an attempt for a fresh start after loosing everything that is important to her. Darcy moves away from Manhattan, New York, after selling her flat, quitting her job, and getting into a feud with everyone that she is close to. Feeling helpless but hopeful, she goes to London, England to stay with her and Rachel's mutual childhood friend Ethan. England is not all that Darcy expected. With things not going her way, Darcy's self-angst brought Ethan to give her some harsh realities. He has a heartfelt talk with her and puts her in her place. Though at first resentful to Ethan's words, Darcy discovers that he is right about her. Darcy realizes that she needs to make some major changes in her life. Things finally seem to be looking up for Darcy as she makes new friends, gets a new boyfriend, and experiences the happiest moments in her life. As she explores herself and goes through soulful changes, she finds herself and the life that she truly desired.     This story is a present day fairy tale with the perfect happily-ever-after ending. I would recommend this novel to those who have found true love, are searching for true love, romantic junkies, and ladies of all ages. With life lessons to learn on each page, this novel can be used as an everyday handbook to life, love, happiness, and friendship.       This review and others can also be found on NotRequiredReading.
0783219695|5.0|I was at the Apollo 11, 12 & 13 launches - they were family vacations for us. As a teen, I remember this vividly, and the movie more than does justice to the memories. The original news footage was an added bonus. From the uncanny portrayal of Gene Kranz (one of my all-time heroes) by Ed Harris - to every member portrayal of the crew, mission control, and families - this was believable to a fault. I actually felt the tension that I felt when the original newscast was airing - and then some, as we are privy to so much of what was speculation on the ground, from the astronauts point of view. I could go on for hours - get this movie immediately if you are over 40, and share it with your children, so they may understand what made the heroes of our day mean so much to us. Faced with unbeatable odds - they made it back to earth to write one of the most famous pages in US history. I personally salute all of you on a job well done. One of the best movies I have bought to date.
B000WQ9UA8|1.0|People still line up for this mindless, pre-fabricated junk? Wow, we've come a long way.  Instead of supporting these celebrity-only types (read lack of talent), why not buy music from a real artist or band? Go support Wilco, The Killers or any number of the other deserving acts out there, and please, enough of Britney Spears and the celebrity types ...    :)
B000FA57N0|5.0|I always liked the FireFly series and this was a great finally to the series. Even if you have never seen the series this movie originated from it's ok as it's a great movie on it's own. The actors are mainly those from the original series with a couple additions that fit right in.<br /><br />The movie gets quite intense in a few areas and does keep you very much interested. I didn't want to pause it to take a break but did to kick a few people out of the house so I could watch in peace and continue to enjoy a well-done movie.<br /><br />It's a shame the series had to be canceled but that's show biz I guess. The movie was basically an ending to the entire series that could have easily gone for another couple of season. All in all it was a great movie that put a lot of information and action into a 2-hour movie.<br /><br />HD Video: 4.5 star, There are a couple of scenes that were a little grainy but for the most part the quality was exceptional.<br />AUDIO: 4.5 stars, I use a 5.1 system and I caught myself looking around the room a couple times thinking a few cuss words as some sounds caught me off guard and made me look. The quality was a lot better than most other movies on the market as they sounded very real and exceptionally clear.
B000VLE3GA|5.0|I agree with the previous review.  the latest sonic upgrade blows away the 1990-94 remasters.  it's about time Zep got the upgrade.  yes, Rhino, upgrade all 10 lps.  i'm sure they'll sell millions, again.
0765310015|4.0|I enjoyed it.  Good action, good pace, a good amount of magic.<br /><br />I like an author how is willing to add magic, dragons, magic swords, and strong monsters, demons, etc.. and keep it realistic.<br /><br />I am now waiting for book 2!
B000UJ48U4|4.0|For those interested in comparing this with the confirmed unrated edition in R3, here is a reproduction of what I submitted on the Rewind forums.    1.   Both R3 HK and the R3 Korea editions that we own are EXACTLY similar in terms of the audio and video in the movie. (There may be other previous editions in HK and/or Korea which may be different, just a note, but we are not aware of them, if they exist. Note that I have Korean R3 in Keep case; earlier this was in digipack -- if between the first and this release, they have changed the content in the Korean dvd, we wouldn't be able to comment on that.)     2.   There is NO digital censorship in either.     3.   At 1:14:01 (NTSC), the women surrounding the man in the cloak stand up and throw off their clothes. Till 1:18:58 there is a background music that has \\"tabla\\" beats and sounds oriental/Indian, and also sounds like someone is reading something backwards, or if a tape is played in reverse.     4.   From 1:18:58 to 1:22:00 - when Cruise witnesses the orgies happening, there is background music that is definitely Indian - and there are lyrics too -- BUT does not sound like Bhagwad Gita at all. The lyrics I heard, to the best of my knowledge, are not Sanskrit, but Tamil. This ends with the dialogue - \\" have you been enjoying yourself \\" - a woman says to Cruise.     5.  On R3, there are Tamil lyrics and Indian music (Tamil, to the best of my knowledge). A couple of words I could make out - \\"kadhala iruvara...\\" << This is not Bhagavad Gita to the best of my knowledge.
0440238609|1.0|After reading the trilogy His Dark Materials, I concluded that this is not a book for children.  The main characters may be children, the Bolvanger chapters may have involved children, but that would not be an endorsement to categorize this series as children's literature, nor should these books be put in the children's sections of the library or a bookstore.  Although this is fiction, Pullman's agenda is very clear here and it leaps from the pages with all its vitriolic verbosity -- reduce the Christian God to a fairy tale.  To do this, make him powerless, decrepit, insignificant, and destroy him.  The stories reek of the author's disdain and hatred for the Catholic Church and Christianity in general.  It seemed that all other religions (demonology, witchcraft, eastern mysticism, etc.) have the author's respect and approval.  It is only Christianity and the Christian God and more especially the Catholic faith that he abhors.<br /><br />I kept waiting for some redeeming value in the characters and the books, even though it is a mean thesis in disbelief in \\"The Authority\\".  However, that never came and the characters who are suppose to buffet this thesis don't seem to do that very well, they all seemed to be following an agenda with very  bad information.  Going about willy-nilly, and half-cocked depending on every suspicious artifact to guide them along, and they  never questioned in any true sense the artifacts they used, (Alethiometer, I Ching sticks, a demonic knife and a possessed computer) not even the scientist used logic or common sense, never sought out good information or the best advice. On a rare occasion when good information just happens their way they summarily dismiss it.  Do we want our children to take that example?<br /><br />The world that Pullman paints after the Dust settled (pardon my pun) is a world I find distasteful and one I would not trust. There would be no hope, no moral code or self restraints, nothing but despair. Is this the world he's warning us about or is this the world he wants?  Apparently it is the latter and this is very curious.ut or is this the world he wants?  Apparently it is the latter and this is very curious.
1932907009|4.0|I've read many books on screen writing and story structure and this is one of the best.  Blake gives a lot of great advice on how to structure a compelling story and breathe life into it with characters and theme.  He gives many examples of his techniques in well known films and even describes the writing process of a few of his own screenplays. The critiques of films that did not work for him was also very useful.  His list of techniques to improve a story and his checklists to make sure the story is working on all levels, are well thought out.  I still refer back to his \\"things to watch out for\\" daily.    My one complaint is that at time the rules seem to strict.  He says certain story events should occur on a particular page number in every screenplay.  I feel like his principles are sound and helpful, but some of his rules are too constricting.    Despite being geared towards film writers, this is a good read for all aspiring writers.  Recommended.
B000O77SOK|5.0|One of the best shows. When can we get the other parts of this show and Boston legal which is our other favorite, plus lets not forget the great Police Lady. When can we expect the DVD's to be sold???
B000VBJEEG|4.0|The movie is wonderful. The DVD is almost bare-bones. Yes, there are a couple new shorts. There's also a 15-minute video conversation with Brad Bird and a famous chef. But there are none of the features that typically come along with a Pixar DVD, like feature commentary, behind-the-scenes production info, storyboards, or anything like that.     If you're a DVD nerd and want to get a lot of bonus features, wait for a special edition instead of buying this one.
B00005JOHC|2.0|[[ASIN:B00005JOHC Two and a Half Men - The Complete First Season]]<br />the first 2 discs were ok  th third disc kept hesitating and was very upsetting to try to see, haven not seen the 4th disc yet  but if it does the same thing I will want it replaced  I would like to have the disc 3 replaced anyway.
B00008URYM|2.0|\\"American Life\\" was the lead-off single for Madonna's 2003 album of the same name. On this single is the version of \\"American Life\\" that was played on the radio. In the song, Madonna talks about trying to deal with fame and trying to be the best. A rap in the song first talks about how people perceive her (she has all these wonderful things that many only dream of having, and assumptions that Madonna's satisfied). Near the end of the rap, however, Madonna talks about having lawyers, chefs, nannies, etc., and poses the question, \\"Do you think I'm satisfied?\\" In the last line of the rap, Madonna seems to express a sense of disillusionment (\\"I'm just living out the American dream, and I just realized that nothing is what it seems\\"). Overall, this is a pretty decent song.<br /><br />The single is backed with \\"Die Another Day [Calderone & Quayle Afterlife Mix].\\" This remix features a throbbing bassline and drum loop which never seems to progress throughout most of the mix. The intro runs for three minutes before the lyrics kick in, and the mix in general is just too long (it's almost nine minutes in length). However, simply making an edit of this mix would not be enough to save it. It's easy to see why this was left off the \\"Die Another Day\\" maxi-single.<br /><br />The sticker that appeared on the shrinkwrap of this single claims that the disc is \\"enhanced with Madonna extras.\\" However, all that's on the enhanced portion is a weblink to a website that features streaming video of behind-the-scenes footage and Madonna buddy icons.<br /><br />The average listener probably wouldn't enjoy this single; however, a Madonna collector would need this disc for the radio edit of \\"American Life\\" and the remix of \\"Die Another Day.\\"
B000V1Y43W|5.0|Good Movie and Picture. Recommend this over regular DVD's (or HD-DVD) if you have a Blu - Ray Player !!!! (1080 P movie, very clear)
B000UGG3A0|4.0|Boston' finest are back with a new release full of good intentions and a bunch of rock-solid tunes. There are a couple of fillers too many, but it is definitely worth buying, though. Ready to sing along with your pals holding a pint of ale in your hands?
0393061434|2.0|Wozniak gives us a book written for the juvenile mind but marketed to adults, recalling the glory days of his youth and telling us almost nothing about Apple after it grew beyond a home-based business. The presentation is avuncular, excessively colloquial, clownish and shallow. It is fundamentally an incoherent and dishonest book.
B000H0MKGK|5.0|I think this is an excellent cd. My 4-year old daughter even requests to listen to it in the car, although she only listens to a few of the songs.I would recommend anything by this artist. John Mayer is very talented.
B000VI70WM|5.0|I have every single Duran Duran CD - inlcuding the Arcadia one.  They are all great in their own way.  As much as I like their old stuff - I think there's no need to keep making the same music year after year.  It's like our company owner says - Change is the key - if you dont change - you go out of business.  I'm glad Duran Duran evolves.  This CD sounds modern yet unique Duran Duran.  Duran Duran is playing in Dallas next month - I'm definately going to go check them out!  On a side note - I didn't even know their album went on sale - there was nothing in Best Buy/Circuit City weekly ads - I found about the albun release date on myspace - how could THAT happen???

0790744295|1.0|Okay,Let's get started. This movie is not my thing, I thought parts of it were laughable and boring, I thought the acting was completely cheesy, I wanted it to get somewhere, but it never did. So, The only story that made sense was \\"The Crate\\". That was it. Everything else was a DRAG!! Now, the actors who starred in the movie, knew better. There's Ed Harris, Stephen King, Leslie Nielsen and Ted Danson, Hal Holbrook, Adrienne Barbeau and Tom Atkins. They should stick to movies people appreiciate more,have a standard. Well, That's all I have to say other than, \\" Creepshow is more like Crapshow,for sure!!\\"
B000VI70WM|2.0|duran duran had a good run back in the 80's and they were always able to balance a Groove with something smooth and something middle of the road. Justin timberlake and Timberland aren't chic and there isn't a \\"Notorious\\" on here to Re-invent these guys now. vocals are just kinda there and the overall Production is good,but the songs just aren't happening on a whole. not a knockout cut on here. still it's good to hear duran,duran doing there thing.
B000LPQ6DE|5.0|I watched this movie just one month after reading the book for the first time.  As I read the book I could not cheer for Mr. Rochester, in fact I was very much hoping that St.John would have a major change of heart and fall in love with Jane.  This movie adaptation brough new light to the character of Mr. Rochester and now I can cheer for him.  Toby Stephens' (Mr. Rochester) interpretation was wonderful and he made Rochester a much more likeable character--not to mention much better looking than the illustrations on the Jane Eyre copy I read.  He was able to capture his roughness without making him despicable. Like every adaptation there were some artistic liberties taken that, however, enriched the story presented without destroying the essence of  Bronte's original work.    My favorite scene happens right after Jane saves Mr. Rochester from the burning bed, and he returns from the tower.  Jane is about to leave his room and he stops her because she did not say goodnight.  He asks to shake her hand and draws close her.  When she tells him that she's cold he puts his robe around her.  And holding the robe draws her even closer.  They are standing in front of the fire and all we see is their silhouettes face to face as if just about to kiss.  There is a second of silence and he swallows hard before releasing the robe.  Terribly romantic.
0743201140|5.0|Really...a breath of fresh air. I found it so valuable that I began using this book's assessment with another assessment I have for my clients. The one-two punch provides a great basis by which a person can begin to see and capitalize on their strengths and thoughts that support them and make the change they want and need in other areas.
B00006J3WH|4.0|This CD is wonderful. It includes all of the songs from the musical episode, as well as a few instrumental tracks.
B000DWMN2S|3.0|I have not read the reviews about this film, so this an untainted opinion. It is true that Ukraine is a free state today in name at least and the past is there to be sifted through, a battlefield of bloody artifacts.  The Lives of Other's, a recent Foreign Film Academy winner does a nice job on Leftist Fascism, the ruined lives of a police state; however, EII takes a more curious, mystical path to relatives lost not all that long ago.     Elijah Woods plays a young Jewish man from New York that is obsessed with his dead grandfather's roots. Those roots include an escape from death at the hands of the SS in 1941. The old man's village had been rounded up and assassinated, all 1000 residents, thereby obliterating the citizens and their way of life.  These scenes are handled with restraint considering, but especially the first half of the film proceeds as a quirky comedy of errors showing the bizarre misunderstandings between perceptions of American Culture and their adulation in modern Ukraine. The Ukrainian hipster, Eugene Lutz, is tortured by his crazy family and amazed at the very unhip American he must guide back to the past.    Woods' character is almost as an autistic mental patient with a deadpan face that shows emotion rarely which at first is amusing and then when the film becomes serious, it is maddening. Nevertheless, this film has it's moments and I recommend for those that want a little history with a minimum of blood.
B000VLE3IS|4.0|This should go without saying, but a 3-disk set of Led Zeppelin's best is going to have lots of really good songs on it. The first two disks here are in chronological order which is convenient, and sound quality is indeed better than ever on all of these songs.     Based on all of that, this is a good collection in and of itself and the $25 list price (discounted below that on Amazon, of course), is quite reasonable. One could argue about the choice of songs -- I for example, would have preferred 3 or 4 more Physical Graffiti tracks -- but that's how it always seems to go with these compilations.    Here's the rub: most of us already have all of these songs so we have no need for this collection unless we have uber-stereos to hear how much better they sound. To those people who don't already have these songs in their collection, I couldn't recommend in good conscience that this is a good place for you to start. The original albums were expertly arranged, each with a feel of its own. Those of us who grew up listening to these studio albums remember the flow that they had from one song to the next: \\"Black Dog\\" became \\"Rock and Roll\\" and then chilled into \\"Battle of Nevermore\\" and so on. That continuity became an important part of the musical experience. These are not \\"concept\\" albums in the league of Ziggy Stardust or Dark Side of the Moon, but they stick together very well. The songs have remained the same, but listening to them in these repackages is like watching lions pace back and forth at the zoo, out of their environment. It seems -- contrived, somehow, and too commercial.    What's funny is that Page and company could have arguably made more money and stayed truer to their roots by doing a super-remaster job like this on all of their original albums. OK, In Through the Out Door might not sell much, but I bet lots of people would gladly buy II, IV (Zoso, dude-with-the-sticks, no-name album, whatever), and Physical Graffiti for the umpteenth time to get a bit better sound out of them.    I can't recommend this package to anybody but the established Led Zeppelin fan who has a superior high-end home stereo system. You guys who do most of your listening on car stereos or (sigh) IPods will hear little or no difference in sound quality. Led Zeppelin neophytes would be much better off experiencing these songs on the true \\"motherships\\" of their studio albums.     Even with the limited recommendation, I can't bring myself to give this any less than four stars because, hey, it's Led Zeppelin at their best.
0962477060|1.0|I started playing guitar in the 70's when there was no internet etc. Wanna play guitar? Buy a songbook with chord diagrams and learn simple basic music theory.     I bought this book along with Guitar fretboard workbook because I was still looking for the \\"magic bullet\\" to break down this mental block I have on lead guitar. Well! What a waste of money! If you think you were confused before wait till you try this system!      Don't believe the reviews.  I would like to see or hear these so called people who rave about this book.       You can't cheat the system, and you won't find no smoking gun or magic bullet in this book. Basic music theory is the answer!
B000WCDI5K|5.0|No, a rarities and b-sides collection is not as coherent as a whole album, it does have some weaker spots that are interesting for fans mainly. Usually.  Well... Sawdust isn't as coherent as Hot Fuss and Sams Town, and it has indeed some weaker spots (Who let you go and ... errr....). But, man, again it is mostly great. It takes two or three times to get hooked to the beauty of Ruby, Sams Town unplugged or great rock-songs like Leave the Bourbon, Sweet Talk, Ballad of MV, and, well, mostly anything on the album.  Yes on this collection they do sound a bit more like other bands. Well, they were supposed to imitate Joy Division right? But you hear a bit of U2, Bruce Spingsteen etc. Who cares?   The best part is Tranquilize, easily one of their strongest songs ever.
B000TCEU4Q|5.0|I had previous bought the Saitek Pro Flight Yoke system and was very impressed with the construction, much better than the CH yoke I have been using. So, I bought the Saitek Throttle Quadrant to add to it to give me multi-engine capability.<br /><br />I mount it next to the other Throttle Quadrant and plugged it into one of the 3 spare USB ports on the yoke.  MY system and FS9 saw it right away.  It came with a bag of colored knobs for easy reconfiguration.  I tested all the buttons with no problems.<br /><br />Note: I did not load the software.  I have tried this with the Yoke and FS9 would crash.  I removed it, and they work fine without it.<br /><br />I have taken many flights and used the Throttle Quadrant for several hours now without a single problem.  Thanks Saitek for a solid product.<br /><br />Also, This product was available thru ANTONLINE who were great in processing and shipping my order.  Received my order in 4 days.

0143038419|1.0|Despite what other people said about this book I am very disappointed. You don't have to travel anywhere to find peace within yourself. Lock up yourself in your room, meditate and you will be able to listen to your heart and find peace. I found this book very dull, boring and shallow. Will not recommend this book to avid reader.    Good thing, I did not buy this book, my friend lent it to me , otherwise I will have a hard time to hide this book. Don't waste your time. Read something else.
B000UNYJXQ|1.0|He makes a good point that health care would be wonderful IF it was free and readily available, but that is not a good idea for the US and the way it SHOULD be. It SHOULD be that the government stays out of the peoples lives here in the US. Government health care, i.e. Hilary-Care, is going to be MESS. It will cost much to setup, then after setup they will alter the way of it to save money, then it will be a very shody and risky system. Government control of most anything, in some ways even \\"security\\", is mostly always a bad thing for the citizens. This is a short and vague discription of why its bad but but beleive me this DVD has a sugar-coated, poisony message.
B000WCDI5K|5.0|This is a collection of songs that were either unrecored or released as B-Sides overseas. They're all good songs but there is one that stands out and it's Sweet Talk. You will love this song from the moment it starts and it gets better as it goes along. Leave the Bourbon On the Shelf is another new one that is being released for the first time and is part of a trilogy of songs. Bourbon is the first part of murder trilogy about a girl named Jennifer, then you will have to go back to Hot Fuss and play Midnight Show, then finish it off with Jenny Was a Friend of Mine. It's alot of fun to play them all in a row and listen to how it all plays out. Look around online and find the footage of them playing them all in a row for the first time, it's great. I would definatly reccomend this for everyone.

B000WCDI5K|5.0|The killers are such a talented and innovative synth rock group that every song they touch is potential gold.  Their Midas touch is apparent on this album, which is a collection of unreleased tracks from previous albums, b-sides, covers, remixes, and one terrific new track.<br /><br />Seventeen tracks make for a long and enjoyable listening experience, starting with the new track and first single \\"Tranquilize\\" which was recorded with Lou Reed.  This is simply one of the best songs I've heard in a while, and has been playing (loudly) on \\"repeat\\" as I write this.<br /><br />Covers: Shadowplay (originally by Joy Division); Ruby, Don't Take Your Love to Town (The First Edition, which included Kenny Rogers); Romeo and Juliet (Dire Straits).<br /><br />B-sides and remixes: All the Pretty Faces; Under the Gun; Where the White Boys Dance; Show You How; Glamorous Indie Rock & Roll; Who Let You Go?; The Ballad of Michael Valentine; Daddy's Eyes; Sam's Town; Mr. Brightside, Questions with the Captain (very short, very hidden track).<br /><br />Previously unreleased tracks: Leave the Bourbon on the Shelf; Sweet Talk.<br /><br />Other: Move Away (remix of track from Spiderman 3).<br /><br />It's almost impossible to recommend specific tracks, but if I was forced to choose, I'd go with:<br /><br />Tranquilize<br />Sweet Talk<br />Shadowplay<br />Ruby, Don't Take Your Love to Town<br />Mr. Brightside<br /><br />Try the samples on Amazon, and then if you agree with me, buy the album or at least these tracks - they're more than worth the price.<br /><br />Amanda Richards, November 14, 2007

B000X1Z0BU|5.0|I had heard about this movie and was pleased to find it offered by Qantas Airlines on my recent flight back in economy class seating from Auckland NZ to LAX.  I watched this movie on a very tiny screen in a very noisy 747, but I was completely enchanted and haven't been able to stop thinking about it.  I am recommending this movie to everyone I know.  It's charming, real and incredibly touching and I cannot wait to add it to my collection.
B00005JPRD|5.0|This movie was truly a work of art. It transports us to another time that, while decades from the moment in which we now live, pulsates with such a deep emotion and observation of conflict that even a different generation can easily relate. What is truly beautiful is that out of the complexity of the background that is the war/peace/draft/music enveloped 60's falls a very simple and elegant love story. The music is amazing. The artistry of the movie and the talent of the cast is well used to bring new light to the already immortalized songs of the Beatles. The renditions are so striking that I would even recommend the soundtrack =) See the movie. It will touch your soul, and it may even strike a chord to inspire some much needed discussion and action in our current 'universe'...

The only thing this book provided me was confidence in birthing. However, it made me suspicious of my doctor's advice, which is/was bad.      My birthing went well, but could have been less painful and finished faster had I listened to my doctor.  Hypnobirthing says that when your water breaks, to not go to the hospital until your contractions are felt.  In my case, I didn't feel contractions for 24 hours.  I did go in after 12 hours when my doctor said that I should be induced.  I resisted.  12 hours after, they induced me. Hypnobirthing says that if you get the epidural, it will be more difficult for you give birth because you do not know how hard to push so you'll be pushing for a long time and then the baby gets stuck and then you'll end up getting a c-section.    So, I did not get an epidural.  BUT there is no possible way to endure drug-induced contractions naturally.  It is/was the MOST painful thing EVER.  At one point, I was ready to get a C-section just to stop the pain.  Finally, I got the epidural.  And I must say that it was the best thing that happened.  I didn't feel a thing and was laughing and telling jokes.  Hypnobirthing also says that you should not push, but you should \\"BREATHE\\" the baby out.  Well, I PUSHED the baby out and 20 minutes later, I had my sweet baby.      Because I was trying to have my birthing the hypnobirthing way, I had unnecessarily lengthened the labor time and endured massive pain.   In the future, I will only use this book during pregnancy to help me relax, which is why I am giving it 2 stars. But I will not practice any of the book's philosophies.  I will not create a birth plan, I will get induced and ask for the epidural.       My advice is to read this book only for the relaxation techniques and to help understand the birthing \\"process\\" but don't bother with the birth breathing AND Listen to your doctor.
B000WCBMA8|3.0|The Hives past 3 albums were all in your face rock albums. They had a good formula. I wouldn't mind if they changed it up a little bit, but that's not really what they did here. They usually only had one slow song on each album, and the songs were good! On the black and white album, there are about 5 slower/experimental songs that are pretty much downright awful. I can't even listen to them. Giddy up and Puppet on a String are just bland, boring and repetitive. I don't mind slow hives songs, just these aren't very good. With those few bombs on the album, I can't give this more than 3 stars. It does have some classic hives songs though. The best in my opinion would be \\"Square One Here I Come\\", \\"Tick Tick Boom\\", and \\"You dress up for Armageddon.\\" Overall though, a little disappointing. Maybe not their least creative, but definitely their least appealing.
B000WGNLLW|5.0|Duran Duran NEVER disappoints me.  Get this album, you will not regret it for a second!!!    Just incredible!! I love it!
B000VLE3GA|5.0|Do not base your decision on whether to buy this album on whether you have the songs on some other album.  The sound quality of the songs on Mothership is so much better than any other album of Zeppelin you may own that you should add this album to your collection.  I don't know if it is the new technology available or if the band members spent more time on the remasters, but each song on Mothership sounds much better than what I have on their studio album versions or on their previous remastered collections.  I feel bad for the reviewers who are not getting the CD because they have the songs in other forms.  Those poor guys are thinking that the same old songs are just being burned to on a new CD.  Their loss.  I also feel bad for the people who just get the MP3 version of this album.  You lose out on the improvement in sound quality if you don't get the actual CD of Mothership.  You only buy Led Zeppelin because they sound great, so you should get the album that makes them sound the greatest.
B000VDDDVO|4.0|First: Most importantly, there is only one thing new to this edition: the colorized version on Disc 2. Which, if you're open to colorization, is pretty amazing. I, for one, am on the fence about it. I love old B&W films, and It's a Wonderful Life looks beautiful in B&W, but it's nice to have this color version to show my kids before they have to be in their twenties to appreciate a B&W film.    Anyways, back to this 4th (?) DVD edition of the movie, and 2nd by Paramount. If you didn't upgrade to last year's 60th Edition from Paramount and still own one of the older (Silver Screen or other) copies, this would be the one to upgrade. I did a side by side comparison of my Silver Screen DVD to this one, and the new black and white transfer is a massive improvement; the difference is easily noticeable.     Or, you can wait until Paramount decides to re-release it again, which they most definitely will. Only question is, when? IMO, this was the DVD they wanted to release for the 60th anniversary, but maybe the colorization wasn't finished and so they rushed out a branded \\"60th Anniversary Edition\\" just to cash in. That's 100% speculation, but it sounds pretty logical, doesn't it?
0151013047|3.0|I've held off on my review of \\"The Reluctant Fundamentalist\\" for a couple of days...waiting, I suppose, for something to come to me.  This book has been so glowingly reviewed, was short-listed for the Booker Prize...and yet?  I just...I just didn't get it.<br /><br />Let me clarify.  I get the book, I feel like I understand what happened and what the author was trying to convey...but I guess I just don't get what all the fuss was about.  (I feel stupid even writing that, but it's true.)<br /><br />I like the narrative style, I like the voice of Changez, I like the way the author builds tension throughout the book with veiled references to what brought Changez and his companion together, and I even like the vague ending.  It was a pleasant read - and I agreed with many of the post 9/11 observations on America and Americans.  But...but...<br /><br />I read books (now) with a notebook and a pad of Post-Its so that I can make notes and mark passages that I don't want to forget.  At the end of this book?  I hadn't made one note and there was not one sticky note in my copy of this short novel.<br /><br />Seriously - I can't tell you how reluctant (sorry, but that's how I feel) I am to write these words.  I am sure that I am missing THE THING about this book that everyone else got.  I don't feel like I was being lazy while reading it...<br /><br />Anyway - I guess that's all I can say.  I would probably pick up another book by Hamid and I certainly congratulate him on his success but I can't say that \\"The Reluctant Fundamentalist\\" will be at the top of any of my lists.  Sorry.
B000VDDDY6|5.0|Let me say these disk have not been released yet here in California, BUT I was fortunate enough to see a theatrical presentation of HD \\"The Menangerie Pt1 & Pt2\\" at the local movie house. This included a look at some of the special features including the methods used to enhance the original film and the re-recording of the the musical scoring. Plus a preview of Season 2.<br /><br />I was a little surprised to see the movie house was packed/sold out.  It was an expensive ticket.<br /><br />Overall, I was very happy with the new special effects.  The Enterprise, as it flew past the planets, seemed much more clearly defined, and the detail was excellent.  The contrast was much improved over the original prints.<br /><br />On the downside, even though it is HD, it is still in the original TV format.  No 16x9 available.  Going to look a little funny on my wide screen TV.<br /><br />As other have mentioned, the price is another drawback.  I purchased the original series just a few short months back, now I'm expected to buy them over again?  Hello, have owned an HD DVD player for sometime now.  Maybe a bit more publicity about the impending release would have been nice.
B000VWE5OY|4.0|I discovered this show watching BBC America, and it seemed worth a try. After several enjoyable but not exactly strong episodes, I thought, this isn't so bad. Then the series started to gain momentum as the season progressed. The episode about fairies was beautifully done, and \\"Out of Time,\\" about a plane from 1953 landing in the present and the havoc it wreaks on people's lives, was the best of the season (haven't seen the rest of the season yet but am looking forward to it). That episode contained the pathos, heart and meaning of a good novel, not something you'll usually find on television. SPOILER ALERT: When one of the passengers desperately tries to find his son, only to find him an Alzheimer's victim in a rest home, it's devastating to watch. The character Gwen brings a humanity to what has been a chilly group, and the mystery behind who Captain Jack is adds some punch to the show. Just recently found out how Torchwood is a spin-off, essentially, of Doctor Who (even the title is an anagram of \\"Doctor Who\\"), so I guess I'll have to start catching up on the new \\"Doctors\\" to get even more insight to Torchwood.    This is a good and sometimes very good show that can't really be pigeonholed. It has supernatural elements to it, but the heart of the show is its characters. The writers should be commended, because these are very multi-dimensional characters with lots of layers.
B000PMFS2I|2.0|For some reason this movie is revered by the gay community, even as they revile it.  The special guest commentary on this edition is by David Schmader, a gay columnist for the Seattle gay newspaper The Stranger.  That paper's gay editor, Dan Savage, also loves the movie -- as do most of my gay friends.<br /><br />The big question is, why?<br /><br />Is it because Joe Esterhaus and Paul Verhoeven make their Vegas showgirls all look & act like Liza Minelli?  Is it because of all the atrocious post-modernist dancing?  Is it because there is a lot of heterosexual nudity in this movie but absolutely no erotica?  Is it because of the not-so-subtle misogyny throughout the movie?  Is it because it hints that men and women can never cross the divide between them?<br /><br />\\"Showgirls\\" is often cited as one of the worst movies ever made, but it's not laughably amateurish like \\"Plan 9\\" or outrageously unlikely like \\"Yentl\\" or painfully miscast like \\"Scoop.\\"  Nope, this movie is expensively produced, with attractive stars and (somewhere in there) an actual plot.  It's just that the whole thing is so gay.
B000K7VHJQ|5.0|Mel Gibson's The Passion of the Christ is one of the most powerful films that I have ever seen. Honestly, I really do not care about the various controversies surrounding the film... some say that Gibson's interpretation was too literal, some say that his film was a pendulum reaction to Da Vinci code where he has attempted to please the church, some have even said that the film is anti-Semitic. Honestly I don't care. I wept through most of this movie and I can't remember when I last did that (probably Schindler's List). Yes, it's bloody. But that's precisely what Gibson wanted to show... the sheer hell of the final hours of Christ. You have to own this because it's a movie that you will need to watch every now and again to remind us of the harshness of life when we start getting down with minor irritants in our everyday lives.
B000W1V5VU|1.0|...and we as an audience lose! This has got to be the lamest Ocean yet - big, loud, boring, (and the best for last), really, really stupid! So these cool guys have a great \\"franchise\\" - good for them! Great moviemaking it's not - great marketing - well, who cares!
0440238609|1.0|Parents considering this book for their children should be warned of the author's strong anti-religous views, which come through clearly as a core element of the work.<br /><br />Pullman believes that throughout human history religion has acted as a brutal force for evil, repressing human freedom, creativity and intellectual progress.  This comes through clearly in the book, in which God, the Church and religion in general are presented as the villians, without compassion, mercy or any redeeming qualities and routinely committing the most barbarous and hateful atrocities.<br /><br />In the key line of the plot, the two heroic children, Lyra and Will, ally themselves with rebel angels to kill God, so that humans (free of repression by or in the name of the divine) can create their own paradise on earth.<br /><br />If this appeals to you, go for it - the first amendment gives you that right. If you find this worldview and value system repugnant, be warned.  This will be a big movie this Christmas season (could that be a deliberate slap at Christians by Hollywood? - what a surprise) and will be heavily hyped by the usual suspects.  Don't buy in without knowing what you're getting.<br /><br />As an aside, I'll note that Pullman falls into one of the classic traps to which so many athiests fall victim.  Even though he clearly wants to kill God, he's unable to resist the temptation to replace Him with another supernatural agency of his own devising.  In this case, it's \\"Dust\\" - the \\"dark particles\\" that are somehow both the cause and result of consciousness and self-awareness and which are themselves conscious (they speak to one of the characters through a computer, and to Lyra through another device).  Of course, this construct - central to the book - undermines and subverts the main plot line, and in the end only substitutes another \\"divinity\\" that will in all liklihood in time generate its own church and its own brand of repression - for example,even in these early days, we see murders justified as necessary to \\"protect\\" and \\"preserve\\" the Dust.<br /><br />I think it's pretty clear that (reservations about the anti-religous content aside) the intellectual coherence of the books has been vastly overrated by many reviewers and prize awarding bodies.  I wonder whether the books would have received the praise they have if the attack on religion had not resonated so strongly with the biases of many of our secular liberal elites.necessary to \\"protect\\" and \\"preserve\\" the Dust.

B000UNYJXQ|3.0|It's becoming a common theme these days for Americans to feel frightened and frazzled about their futures. Michael Moores, 'Sicko,' may not have succeeded as a fair and balanced appraisal of America's healthcare system, but it does highlight some of its critical shortcomings; his conversation with the Americans currently living comfortably in France was especially enlightening. The level of comfort they experienced with their socialized healthcare provider was astonishing. Equally compelling was the story of the woman who lost her husband to kidney cancer. In the end, in a country as wealthy as the U. S., the healthcare system should be less confusing and certainly more accommodating. Some issues should be considered beyond the realm of profit. In the interest of balance; while I'll confess to loving this movie, I was disappointed that Moore didn't investigate fully the profit motive of insurance companies; thus, my conservative rating.
6305127689|5.0|Greatfuly i didn't have to wait for weeks before delevery of the dvd. It came in great condition in original packaging. Proble one of the fastest delevery times i have seen from any seller on Amazon.
0553582038|3.0|Okay, its been about a year since I read the book, so my apologies for that. However I do distinctly remember being disappointed in \\"Feast for Crows\\". I was hoping that Martin would be using this installment to try to bring things together and bring at least *some* closure to things. Instead, the plot branched out even more than ever before.    My fear is that what started as one of the best series I have ever picked up will end up like Jordan's \\"Wheel of Time\\" series (11 books, and who knows if the 12th will post-humuosly tie things up). This is a potential problem with all \\"epic\\" fiction, unfortunately. It's a real shame in this instance because Martin writes the best \\"bad guys\\" ever - I love the fact that he can make me love the Imp, Jamie, Stannis & Renly as well as the \\"good guys\\" (the Stark kids, Daenerys).     Hope he is able to bring things back on track before the series loses too much focus.
B000VECAEO|5.0|How sad. This is the final season of my favorite show. This particular season had some of the wackiest comedy ever: Kramer installing a talk-show set inside his house, George going to ridiculous lengths to obtain an apology, Jerry becoming obsessed with a toy collection etc. The topper, of course, is the finale, with all four protagonists being tried for being such terrible human beings! Just what the doctor ordered! I am truly saddened that this is the last and final set that I will ever get!
B0007P0LO8|5.0|Reading some of the other reviews here, I wonder if I'm in the same universe. I feared this dvd for a long time, having been bleached of hope by years of indifferent if not hostile reviews and commentary about it. I think Puccini planned that NO performance of Butterfly would ever truly be sufficient, truly right. But surely, Ponnelle's valiant film effort comes close. For me, closer than any other available dvd version. Two reasons front and center - the singing of Mirella Freni and Karajan's handling of the score with the Vienna Philharmonic. Having just this past week watched the Butterflys of Cedolins and Barker, Freni's magnificent singing is proof that the mitred age of Italian opera is passed. Any musician knows there's no comparison between Freni's singing and that of Cedolins and Barker, both of whom offer respectable enough versions of the score. Freni sings grand opera from the inside out, and THAT grace is found missing in every other available dvd of this opera. If the exposition of the human voice, yes even in verismo art, is your reason for opera, this film will love you, and you it. Mirella Freni's musicianly command of Puccini's eternally fecund score is overwhelming from beginning to end. The singing is epic, intelligent and purged of self regard. No less fertile is Karajan's intense way with Puccini, fevered but ever cool, ever rigorous. The Vienna orchestra finesses textures like a cat, every nuance cared for with golden perfection - it's a beautiful thing! Christa Ludwig embraces the role of Suzuki with incomparable singing and a riveting attentiveness as Cio-Cio-San's confidant. Her singing of the incantations that open Act 2 is easily equal to Cossotto's turn with Price. Forget the complaints about lonely heaths and cramped houses. Ponnelle creates a bewitching exterior with coastal grasses; the interior sets are never onerous or pretentious, reaching in fact a tremendous peacefulness by film's end. Ponnelle's genius with colors and texture, and certainly his motive behind the camera is remarkable, emotional, noble. What more can you ask for? The discolation from lip-synching is noticable but minimal, and even used to engaging advantage by Cio-Cio-San who occasionally assumes interior reflection by eschewing singing altogether, something impossible on a live stage. It's not perfect but damned near, a worthwhile filmed vision of an inexhaustible opera.
B000WQW988|5.0|Yes, it's about F******* time. Now I can finally toss out my old VHS recording of this legendary performance.
0060888695|3.0|Roses Pritchard did the audio on cassettes ten to fifteen years ago.  Frankly, I enjoy her rendition much more that the audio on CD with Sissy Spacek.  I am just not hearing much expression in Spacek's voice...very bland.  I was also disappointed that the first CD in the set has a defect.  I don't know if there will be others in the set of eleven CD's or how much trouble it will be to try to get a replacement. Very disappointing and annoying.
057504800X|5.0|Gaiman & Pratchett combine to create probably the funniest book I've ever read.    Warning: this book is irreverent (some might say blasphemous) about potentiall sensitive topics such as God, Heaven & Hell, demons & angels, and the Anti-Christ. If you are sensitive to these issues, do not read this book. It will only upset you.    On the other hand if you enjoyed Monty Python's \\"Life of Brian\\" (or even the Holy Grail), think that God can enjoy a good joke as well as anyone, and try to scare your plants into remaining green & vibrant, then absolutely read this book!
0143038419|2.0|I don't understand all the hoopla over this book.  I have tried two different times to get through it and CANNOT.  It's so boring.  People rave and rave and say it's fabulous but I just don't understand.  I've only made it to India and can't stay awake.  And I read and LOVED LOVE IN THE TIME OF CHOLERA which was slow...but good, intriguing, had a plot. So I can get through books others find boring.  I gave it two stars because I didn't finish - one star is a freebie for the part I didn't read.
0440238609|4.0|I read these books over the course of two weeks.  Whenever I had a spare moment, I could not put them down.  The characters, settings, storyline are incredibly compelling.  Pullman certainly creates memorable characters, from the ethereal, compassionate Serafina Pekkala unforgettable coldness and complexity of Mrs. Coulter to the fearsome Iorek bear king.  These books had me mesmerized and totally immersed in the world/s of Lyra and Will for three straight weeks.  If you like fantasy, adventure, colorful and memorable characters, these fast-paced novels are chock full of all these things.    However, since this series has recently attracted controversy due to the upcoming release of the film version, I might as well address the obvious.. If you are a Christian conservative, this books will likely offend you... I would strongly caution that if you even allow your kids to read these books, you'd better be intellectually prepared for the results. There are very strong adult and religious (or anti-religious, rather) themes, especially laced throughout the second and third books. You should read them yourself and prepare to engage in some thoughtful, open-minded discussion. You can either use the opportunity to simply bash another book a la the Da Vinci Code, or you can use this as an opportunity to thoughtfully engage the culture.      I myself found the atheistic themes a bit overdone and contrived, especially in the third installment, but that doesn't mean I enjoyed the books any less.      The Golden Compass was by far my favorite book of the three.

0201485672|1.0|I agree mainly with all the comments below 3 stars. The book could be \\"refactored\\" in less than 50 pages. I am also surprised with the high ratings of the book.<br />Do not buy the book! It just says: \\"setup a test harness for your code and then improve it without fear\\". I think it is a beautiful idea. However, you do not need to read 500 pages for that.
B00004BZ16|5.0|The most misunderstood album in punk (yes, punk) starts with the most cliched adaptation of the (then) moribund disco scene ever recorded, a song so silly and groovy and flat-out simple that you could hear the groans all the way to Brixton. The Clash Are Dead, said the non-chorus, non-anthemic grooves of \\"Magnificent Seven\\": Long Live Whatever We're Up To.<br /><br />\\"Sandinista!\\" often gets criticized, as most triple-anythings do, for having a lot of filler. I think these folks are missing the overall point. For it is in the moments of supposed \\"filler\\"  - the Rebel Waltzes, the Broadways, the weird radio chatter that supports the whole vibe - that the real distinguishing feature of the album comes alive: it's that SOUND, that weird, twisty funkiness that didn't quite sound like funk, and it sure wasn't soul, but something very strange and new indeed. I may be in the minority here, but for my ears, the peak of the album is traditional side three (\\"Lightning Strikes\\" to \\"Sound Of The Sinners\\", for all you remasterphiles), where everything really just cuts loose from the expectations of The New Clash Album and becomes a bunch of guys just playing songs they feel into for the moment without abandon. Here, the single most Clash-like track appears (\\"Up In Heaven\\", a masterpiece), as well as flirtations with third-world posturing (\\"Corner Soul\\") and the funkiest bassline since Busta Jones jammed with Sly & Robbie (\\"Lightning Strikes\\"). It also contains the closest approximation of what the entire project craves to sound like: \\"If Music Could Talk\\", a song so meandering and captivating that it doesn't have any genre underneath its shuffling feet. Is there really an album like this anywhere?<br /><br />The astonishing thing is, if you were to isolate either of the six sides into one two-sided album, it would still have been such a serious head change that we'd still be trying to figure it out. Imagine if they had left off the last third of the album and all the dub / version / remix mania: I'd still want to have heard it, considering. The mark of a good album that happens to be long is when you couldn't imagine leaving anything off and still retain the big picture. It isn't end-to-end shocking like the album that preceded it, obviously. And yes, I'll admit, it does get overconfident. But if you consider the context of this album's release, from Ian Dury & The Blockheads (most of who appear on \\"Sandinista!\\") to Talking Heads' \\"Remain In Light\\"/\\"Bush Of Ghosts\\" period, The Clash were truly locked into something that was happening at the time. Maybe it's a fascination with roots rock, or the newly-dropping hip-hop culture, or the explosion of punk into subgenres. Regardless, sometimes ambition is as important as results. That's the case here. (In fairness, some of the political moments are actually quite heartfelt, such as \\"The Call Up\\" and its forlorn plea for dignity.)<br /><br />By the time you reach the last songs, you're at an inversion of what \\"London Calling\\" represented: we have suggestion, not aggression. The sound of revolution from all corners, fading into the street parade. Music for people who thought that there were more similarities than differences between mods, rude boys, rockers, skins, punks, and b-boys. Call it impressionistic punk rock.: I'd still want to have heard it, considering.

B000VBP382|2.0|Yet another re-release DVD, promising more special features when any regular fan, like myself, already has the first DVD release.     About this DVD:    1st Disc: Is the exact DVD released prior to this one. It has the widescreen movie version and all the same features on the previous DVD release.    2nd Disc: This is the new disc with \\"extra\\" special features including...  -Fullscreen movie version.  -\\"The Politics of Dating\\" - A short feature with cast, crew, and director talking about modern vs. P&P time dating (i.e. dancing, the 'touch', etc).  Most of the interview clips are recycled from what we've previously seen on the first disc special features. And brought little to nothing new to the table and lasted around 7 minutes.   -\\"Galleries of the 19th Century\\" - Interactive photo gallery. Fun.   -\\"The Stately Homes of Pride and Prejudice\\" - A small handful of about 5 minute interviews with cast, crew, and director talking about the different locations they worked at. New stuff, but nothing exceptionally interesting that lasts for long.  -\\"Pride and Prejudice Family Tree\\" - A DVD menu telling us how the characters in the movie are related. It is pointless and useless, nothing interesting or new.   -And that's IT.     Packaging:  It's absolutely gorgeous. I think all the money was spent on the box rather than putting together a decent 2nd disc. The package is made to look and open like a book. It's a great, beautifully designed set that is hard to resist if you saw it in stores.     Booklet:  A booklet was included in this set with some new, unseen photographs and talk about costumes, characters, and music. It's basically like a scrapbook of images and tidbits of various cast and crew's thoughts.     Included:  The soundtrack is included in a paper sleeve along with a ticket for director Joe Wright's upcoming film Atonement.     Conclusion: If you were hoping for new interviews with the cast and director, unseen behind the scenes footage, deleted scenes, or anything worth shelling out more money to buy another DVD for, then you will be severely disappointed. If you're like me, and already own both the movie and soundtrack this really isn't worth the $28 buy. Because ultimately you're just getting just a pretty box, another copy of the DVD you already own, and a throwaway extra disc. But if you don't have the DVD or soundtrack yet, then I say go for this set because it will be worth the extra money to get both the movie and soundtrack, and flashy box.     I give it 2 stars for the pitiful attempt at \\"exclusive all-new features\\"
B000VI70WM|3.0|If the entire album was as anything like \\"Falling Down\\", this would be a great album.  It's not.  The mix is bad - vocals are flat and too up-front, pushing the rest of the music to the back.  And the rest of the music isn't much to bring forward.  I'm not sure if Roger is even playing the drums - it sounds like synth percussion throughout.  Many songs are \\"club-ready\\", but that's not why Duran Duran fans like Duran Duran.  It's because they're unique, talented musicians...and both the uniqueness and talent fall by the wayside on this album, thanks mostly to Timbaland's influence, I believe.  I really hope that this isn't a lasting first impression, and that it will grow on me.  If so, I'll be sure to retract this review and replace it with a more positive one.  Just disappointed in this follow-up to a strong Astronaut.

B00005JPLW|5.0|Good Movie haven't checked out the Special features but I doubt they are much since they don't put much on em these days. Aliens special edition is still the only TRUE special edition worth the money.
B000WQ9UA8|5.0|This is Britney's best cd by far. This CD could be on repeat all night at any club. Every song is upbeat and dance worthy. Every song could be a single and becomes contagious. Brit's best work.
0810993139|5.0|My 9 year old daughter loved this book and couldn't put it down. She is typically into girlie books, so I was glad to see her branch out and give this one a try.  She was even taking it out during recess to read to others in her class.
0743496728|4.0|So, I loved this book, and I really wasn't expecting to!  This was assigned in my book club and all I knew was it was based on a school shooting.  Not the best topic, in my opinion!  But, boy was I wrong!  The angle that the author used in telling the story made it very real, yet easy to read.  When I was done, I was reccomending it to others (who had the same opinion when told what the story line revolved around).  The 3 people that I \\"talked in\\" to reading it agreed with me and liked it also!
0439813786|5.0|This book drew me in from the very first page and kept me in amazement throughout.  I have been uncertain of what to make of most graphic novels, but this one, though not really a graphic novel, I immediately valued.  I have long been interested in Georges Melies, and that just added to it. I can accept a lot of the problems the one and two star reviewers have with this book, but it succeeds on many more levels than it fails on. For me the criticism of the art is not valid. My one complaint is that the gutter where the book is bound in the middle interrupted several of the pictures in a disruptive and annoying fashion. I hope there will be an edition of the book that will show the drawings without the break.
B00005JNTX|5.0|I just saw this movie last night. I know, how much of a loser am I? I was just positive that I wouldn't \\"get\\" it because I hadn't read the graphic novels, and didn't really know much about them. When I put it in, I was shocked. It is an awesome movie!! I can see how some people didn't like it, but I wasn't one of them. The sweet digital backgrounds, the casts, the characters, the colors (and lack of)made me love this movie. It's definitly going on my wish list. Just give it a chance, you might love it like I do.
038533348X|4.0|Not as good as Sirens of Titan, but easily as good as Slaughterhouse.  Definitely worth the short time it takes to get through one of these.

B000WCDI5K|5.0|Since my purchase of Sawdust, I have not been able to stop listening to it.  Many of b-sides are just as good (some even better) as songs that have appeared on the Killers two studio albums.  Saying that, the album does have a few low points (i.e. \\"Show You How\\" and \\"Who Let You Go?\\").  There are a lot of outstanding songs to be found here, like the new single \\"Tranquilize\\" which is a duet with Lou Reed and \\"Romeo and Juliet,\\" a Dire Straights cover.  Fans of the Killers are more likely to appreciate this compilation rather than the casual listeners.  Definitely worth the purchase and will hopefully hold us fans over until the release of their next studio album.
B000R7HY0K|1.0|All right, I don't work in movies or anything like that, I'm a teacher in a small town. That being said, I don't see how this movie got made. They say that it's an \\"homage\\" to trashy drive-in movies of the late 60's early 70's. Is this really a genre that was screaming for a modern homage? And what about the target audience? I'm 29 and was born in 1978. The people who saw these type of movies at the drive-in's would have to be how old exactly? If it was a good movie in it's own right, maybe that bit of idiot thinking wouldn't matter. But the movie BLEW!!! There were wpman talking crap for 45 mins as we waited for some action, then BAM, 2 stupid minutes of it. Then, more dead space, and then the only part of the movie I liked, when the table was turned on the guy. If possible, just watch the last couple of scenes on youtube or something and save yourself some time and money. Oh, and i love most of Rodreguz's and Tarantion's other movies. This was just them jerking around and having a studio pay for it.
0684800713|2.0|I had a difficult time getting into this book.  It was not difficult to read and finish, but very difficult to have any feelings about or connections with the characters.
B00004Y87O|5.0|Escape From New York is in my top ten list of all-time favorite movies. It is also the movie that made me a hard core Kurt Russell and John Carpenter fan. I've watched it probably 100 times since the 80's and it never gets old. It was the first time I heard Kurt Russell use the f-bomb on screen and it was such a contrast from his \\"Mr. Disney\\" days.<br /><br />Another thing about the movie is the music, scored by John Carpenter. I love it and outside of the Day The Earth Stood Still, is my favorite movie score of all time.<br /><br />I could go on and on quoting lines, lines that I still use in everyday life. This is one great movie and I highly recommend it. Rock on Snake!
B000VBJEEG|2.0|The movie is great, but every time we put in the DVD, it freezes when it comes to the menu.  Others have had this problem (see other reviews).  Disney should reissue this DVD.  Major problem.
B000O1799U|5.0|This movie embodies all of the girl groups of the 60(s) even though it is loosely based on the life of The Supremes including Diana Ross. Buy this movie! There is no wonder Jennifer won an Oscar for her role in this movie. How could she not! What a voice! I'm telling you....you are not going to want to stop watching it.

B00006ADD5|5.0|A timeless classic by David Lean, acted to perfection by perhaps the most underrated actor of the century - Peter O'Toole - and backed up by the electrifying performance of Omar Sharif in his debut \\"big\\" role.  It is the history of how our present day allies - Saudi Arabia - came into existance, and provides insight into the origins of their religious disregard for human rights.  It also shows the depth of character of Lawrence's strength of character as he single-handedly (well, almost) shapes the future of the entire Middle East - whether the British Empire goes along with it or not.  This is as essential to your movie experience as Orson Welles' Citizen Kane - if not more so.  It certainly is more  visual in its widescreen color, and violence among the dunes.

B000VLE3IS|5.0|So what if the 2 CD \\"Mothership\\" doesn't cover any new ground that hasn't been covered on other compilations and box sets?The remastered sound quality( by Jimmy Page and John Davis at Alchemy Mastering,London)of these heavily familiar Led Zeppelin classics now sound fresh and new again.Every guitar lick,bass line and pounding drum has been restored to the highest fidelity,putting it ahead of even the fine 1993/94 remasters ,either on headphones or on a stereo.Considering the low price of this set(as low as $11.99 at some places for the CDs-only set),it doesn't hurt to purchase this for the time being until all the classic Zeppelin studio albums get the same sonic treament as this!
B000AYQJ3I|2.0|Always have been curious about this gig, a curious mixture of characters on stage from Klaus Voorman, Billy Preston, Ringo, and of course Dylan. What stands out is how frankly mediocre a songwriter George Harrison was, the sentiments are in the right place but apart from Badfinger this give a good sniff of why Punk had to happen a few years later... Nice Dylan though.
0553588486|5.0|Pros:<br /><br />+ A well rounded, complex set of characters.<br /><br />+ Feels different from your standard fantasy fare.<br /><br />+ Fluid, descriptive writing style.<br /><br />+ Gritty, realistic, etc.<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />- The book becomes less interesting as the characters separate from one another.<br /><br />- Moves the story (or stories) along very little for an 800 page book.<br /><br />Set in the shockingly complex and realistic kingdom of Westeros, this book follows the conflicts of a dizzying array of people and houses. This has got to be the best fantasy novel that I have read in a good long time.  This book is not typical of the genre.  Gone are the clear distinctions between good and evil and you won't spend the whole book waiting for the sections with that interesting grey character because every character is grey. It is possible to sympathize with each of the nine point of view characters, but each of them also have very obvious flaws and quirks which are heightened by them being viewed through the lens of the others.<br /><br />The book largely deals with the conflicts and political jockeying of great houses and it has a quite a realistic feel to it.  There are a few fantasy creatures such as direwolves, but in general, you get the impression that magic is something that existed in the past and may in fact exist in the present, but it is hard to pin down how to use it or when it is being used.  Most of the more fantastic elements remain on the periphery of the story.<br /><br />The length of the book helps Martin introduce the world and characters to a huge extent.  Some readers, however, may find Martin's slow story development off putting.  Also, the story reaches its most interesting points when these marvelously developed characters interact with one another, but as the story goes on, they become separated and this happens less and less often.  Daenerys is separated from the other point of view characters entirely.<br /><br />Overall, though, this is a marvelous book with few flaws.  The political machinations that pit Stark against Lannister are both fascinating and personal.  You will likely find yourself loving two characters that are constantly played against one another, making reading this book a nuanced and thought provoking experience.pit Stark against Lannister are both fascinating and personal.

0345494997|3.0|I suggested this book for my bookclub, most of the ladies in this bookclub prefer a more uplifting subject matter, but those are hard to find anyhow.  I don't know what I was thinking when I chose this - obviously I knew nothing about Frank and Mamah or the abrupt end.  I learned a lot about Frank Lloyd Wright and the atmosphere for women of that time period.  I can appreciate her struggle with living her life the way she did, but it also gave me a headache to read about it throughout.  I can't appreciate anybody abandoning her kids.  Overall I think it was a good debut novel for the author, and thought provoking, but for me personally I had to take a couple Tylenol.
B000003TAW|5.0|When I was fifteen I had two friends that loved Weezer. We'd walk home together and pop in this CD and they'd dance in their socks around the house. Listening to this CD brings back fond memories of that time when we were all innocent and finding our way in the world.<br /><br />Every song is just great. They're very youthful and evocative of a certain time, but they're also very transcendent. \\"Say it Ain't So\\" is one of my favorite tracks. It is melancholy, but it is also one of those songs you can't get enough of. \\"In the Garage\\" is the perfect follow up track, because it embodies tranquil happiness. It flips your mood back upside down and leaves you with a good taste in your mouth. Other songs are just as optimistic. \\"Buddy Holly\\" is just as silly as the pop tunes of the jazz age, but its innocence is what makes it appealing. \\"The Sweater Song\\" is another example; even though it is seemingly sad, the subject is lighthearted and therefore fun to listen to.<br /><br />I don't know lots about music, so I can't comment on the musical quality. All I know is that this CD strikes a strong chord with me, and I listen to it often.
0525950079|4.0|I'm only half way thought this book, so my comments are based on what I've read so far.    Like other reviewers, I've read Pillars of the Earth (numerous times) and it's on my very short list of most favorite books.    I agree with others that World Without End is very readable, enjoyable and sometimes compelling. I will certainly finish reading it and will probably recommend it to others.    But I can't shake the feeling that \\"I've been here before\\". The structure of the story lines and how the author sets the stage and tells the story is very similar to Pillars of the Earth. It really does feel like this is  simply a continuation of the previous book and that nothing new has really been invented. Of course this could be a good thing or a bad thing depending on your personal tastes.    A good deal of the action of World Without End centers around the constant tug-of-war and plot-twists between ruthless, power hungry characters, and characters that are decent folk trying to get by in tough times with honesty and fairness.    The oneupmanship and cleverness of these events are often entertaining and sometimes impressive, but it feels to me like there's just too much of it.    Worse than the quantity of it is that I just don't care as much about the characters and therefore going on this never-ending ride of who-can-outfox-who is sometimes more tedium than pleasure.    In Pillars of the Earth, I cared about most of the characters. Their inner and outer conflicts were developed enough that you identified with them and wanted the to come out ahead. When they were victorious you wanted to cheer. When they were treated unjustly, you wanted to see all the wrongs righted.    But in World Without End, the author doesn't get us close enough to any one character to really have a vested interest in the story.    Another thing I've noticed is that most characters seem to be driven from a single emotion, which feels single-dimensional to me, and a bit contrite.    For example, Ralph is driven by a need to get ahead and to exploit whoever he can. Ditto for Godwyn and several members of his family.    Merthin seems simply driven out of a need to be a great carpenter.    Gwenda just wants to be loved by Wulfric and that seems to drive almost everything she does.    Claris is really the character that comes across as multi-dimensional. Her reactions don't always follow-suit with single-minded emotions, making for a more interesting character.    She does not always make sense to us because she does not always make sense to herself. You get the feeling she is a person in-the-making and the outcome will be as much a pleasing surprise to her as it will be for the reader.  I would like to see such depth in some of the other characters.    All in all, I would say I'm satisfied with the first half of this book and think the author has done a fine job.     However, it will not displace Pillars of the Earth from it's #1 spot on my favorite's list.
0553582038|3.0|Pros:    + Martin's writing style continues to wow.    + The characters and world retain much of their complexity.    Cons:    - This is half a book (and not the better half).    - Many storylines seem stalled.    Martin's series continues to impress with its scope and complexity, but the decision to split the characters, putting half in this book and half in the next is absolutely fatal to this novel.  Why Martin wouldn't have taken the sensible solution and split this chronologically, especially as the books in this series don't tend to have definite endings anyway, is beyond me.  We are left with a huge book which leaves out most of the more important storylines and characters.  You will not see Jon, Tyrion, Catelyn, Bran, or Daenerys as point of view characters in this book.  Instead we are left with Cersei (one-dimensional disappointment), Jaime (stalled story line), Brienne (completely irrelevant to the plot), and Arya (stalled storyline) as well as a number of characters who don't seem terribly important, but who get a chapter or two in this book.  The only point of view characters who seem to have plot progression or grow significantly are Sansa and Samwell.  The lack of important characters highlights a problem that was not as obvious in the other books in the series -- Martin's story progression is very slow.  At the end of this book, I don't get the sense that anything is terribly different than when it began.      That said, this book is still a step up from much of the fantasy out there.  His world is gritty and real and his characters show nuances scarcely imagined in other fantasy books.
B000VBJEEG|1.0|The movie is wonderful - 5 stars - but the disc won't play correctly in Pioneer DVD players.  The menu freezes when it first pops up (although you can push fast forward to get to the main screen), and then freezes again when you select \\"play movie.\\"  I contacted Disney DVD about this, and they did recognize that it is an issue.  They told me I have to go to scene selection and select the first chapter to watch the movie, and there was nothing else they could do.  Personally, I find this unacceptable -- I think a disc I paid for should play when I push play.  I think the problem is probably a result of some copy protection code they have on the disc, although I can't say for sure.    That said, the movie is beautiful, both visually and thematically, and I highly recommend it to anyone.  I do miss the 2-disc sets with lots of extras that Pixar has released in the past.  I think Disney is a little too fond of releasing subsequent \\"special editions\\" and \\"limited releases,\\" and my guess is that we will see another version of this movie with more content on DVD at some point. Maybe that version will work in my DVD player.
B000VLE3IS|4.0|A good compilation for sure. But the third one. Compare the tracklisting with Remasters (2 CD version) and Early and Later Days... quite the same isn't it.    Yes,the sequencing is quite better than the older ones. But maybe it was time for one or two new acoustic tracks like Goin to California, and most of all, the songs remain the same.    So only 4 stars for the little bit of Déjà Vu.

B00005LC1H|5.0|The set is expensive but well worth it. I bought it at a retail outlet & paid much more than what is listed here. This is the best British TV series I have ever seen. My exposure to British series is limited though, I've only seen what has been aired on PBS. Of all those that I'm familiar with, this one is the least British. John Cleese & company are a riot; some of this borders on slapstick. Hilarious is the best word that comes to mind.  The quality of the discs are excellent & includes a lot of bonus materials. Though expensive, this set was well worth the price. Enjoy one of the funniest shows that's ever been produced anywhere in the world!!!
B000VL9XE2|4.0|i'm one of those guys who still hasn't purchased miss machine.  the only track i've heard from that album is actually panasonic youth, and from what i hear that's the best track from that record.  with all that being said, i'm actually disapointed with this record.  i was expecting more from these guys, don't get me wrong, it's a good record... but i was just expecting more boundries being pushed.
B000OZ2CZW|3.0|I normally don't review new Pop/R&B artists albums but a friend of mine gave me a copy of this album that he burned from ITunes. Even though this is not my type of music I can appreciate the fact that its well produced. It sort of reminds me of the 80's R&B I grew up on. I'm 29 so keep in mind my opinion might be slightly jaded. I'm not familiar with Robin/Rihanna's previous work but from what little I've seen of her she's got the triple threat package going for her: singing, dancing and beauty. She's not a vocal powerhouse and she won't be the next Whitney Houston or Aretha Franklin but I think she knows that. However, her vocals are strong enough to carry the tracks produced for her and she does have a very unique voice. Thats really the key in the music business these days, having a signature sound that stands out so that people will know its you when they hear you. Its good for what it is, good dance music for this younger generation. They don't really care about strong vocals anyway, they just want to hear a good beat and an infectious groove. This album definitely delivers that. Not to discredit Rihanna because I don't think her vocals are horrible by any means. Especially not compared to some of the other female artists out there today. But I'm old school so you have to keep in mind that I'm judging them on a different scale. I'm looking past the looks and moves. I think her vocals are perfect for the type of music that she does and if she sticks to that she will be o.k. and will have a pretty successful career. She already has a large fan base amongst young people and thats really her niche. Overall I'd say its worth buying if you're into this type of music but for me I'll stick to Shallamar, Atlantic Starr, Cameo and the rest of the Old School artists. Hey, get in where you fit in. Music is changing I just don't want to change with it. Guess I'm getting old.  Peace!!!!
1401300529|5.0|I, like many of the reviewers, am a veteran of the Korean War, landing there from Okinawa on July 24th, 1950.   I found the book to be exactly right on, having read most of the other books relating to this conflict. Early authors, at the time, were limited as to their information, which forced incorrect conclusions as to many facets of the war.   Students of history of this era may be interested in reading \\"Mao: The Unknown Story\\" by Jung Chang. Her chronicle of another international megamaniac gives credence to the real reason why the Korean Armistice was signed.  Neither Stalin or Mao believed in Prisoners of War, particularly their own. Stalin observed \\"We don't have prisoners of war, we have deserters\\".  Mao was of the same ilk, and he had 2 million Nationalist Soldiers who surrendered to him during the Chinese Civil War, and Mao was ready to unleash them against Allied Forces in Korea, proving to all that he had no regard for human life, willing to sacrifice every soldier.  At the same time, Mao was making strong demands of Stalin in respect to arms supples for his army. Mao was not satisfied with ordinary arms delivery: he wanted the USSR to build arms factories in China for the benefit of Mao, and once Stalin had the A-Bomb perfected, Mao wanted it as well. Stalin at this point saw the danger in Mao, so he (Stalin) decided to end the war, rather than supply Mao with the A-Bomb.   Moreover, the Korean War continued for two more years and the stale-mate was over volunteer repatriation of all prisoners. Sources in the UN apparantly sensed that forced repatriation of Chinese Communist Forces(really Nationalists) would evolve into a blood-bath when they were returned.   Halberstam's opus in my mind, is timeless history, written in a flawless manner and well covered in tems of the political turmoil that continued the war.  I also authored and published a book on the Korean War, titled \\"Escape from North Korea\\" and I invite my fellow reviewers to read the review comments on Amazon.com  Paul G. Petredis

075640407X|2.0|That Mr. Rothfuss has a good vocabulary is evident. He pounds you with his vocabulary, beats you with his vocabulary and leaves you bloodied and bruised.<br /><br />What he lacks is the ability to draw characters well.  The characters in the \\"present\\" section are entirely two dimensional.  It is not until the \\"first person\\" section that the narrative picks up to anything beyond a crawl and succeeds only because the characters are just interesting enough that curiosity is piqued.<br /><br />The prose (although gorgeous, and filled with more details about geography and money than you could ever want to know) is incredibly tedious by sheer weight of words.<br /><br />A good editor should have been able to chop at least half (if not two thirds) of this massive tome and come up with a far more interesting read.  As it is, although interest is piqued it is not piqued enough to make me want to pursue this any further.<br /><br />Perhaps with age, Mr. Rothfuss will learn brevity.

B000TIO4Z0|5.0|Maria Callas,thirty years after her death, refuses to be forgotten, and nor should she be, for there will never be another like her.  Her artistic, musical, and dramatic attributes are entirely too vast to go into here, and besides, Callas needs no advocates ---- she's still converting people to her artistry today, and probably always will.  Why is she the most revered soprano of the Twentieth Century?  Much of the answer lies here on the discs including in this beautiful box.  The operatic repertoire represented here is immense -- Callas covered everything from Norma and Sonnambula through Turandot and Tosca, by way of Aida, Pagliacci, Cavalleria Rusticana, Lucia, and even two Rossini comedies.  She was a vocal cameleon, taking on a different voice for every role she portrayed.  She had a thousand colors in her voice, and her personal magnetism infused her singing.  A perfect vocal emission?  Certainly not, but it was always a great instrument of expression, and sometimes, of great beauty.  Callas forged an operatic path that no other soprano dared to tread, possibly because she realized that her particular vocal sound was one which needed to be studied to be appreciated.  Virtually all of the Callas performances here are models of their kind.  Her colleagues (di Stefano, Tucker, Monti, Gobbi, Barbieri, Gedda, etc.) all shine alongside of her, and Tullio Serafin (her mentor), Herbert von Karajan, Antonino Votto, Gavazzini, and Galleria all provide exemplary leadership.  This box is a must have for those who have yet to experience the artistry of the greatest operatic artist of the last century, one whose vast legacy will live forever.
B000W74EQC|1.0|Once again, Warner Home Video is here to try to rip you off your hard earned money. Now with this 1 disc edition of Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone. Usually, companies reissue \\"new special edition\\" dvds with new features, extra discs, and deleted scenes sometime after they've released \\"regular\\" edition dvds. They do this to get consumers to buy the new special edition dvds after they [the consumers] have purchased the regular edition dvds. In this case, the new edition \\"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone\\" is nothing more than scam compared to its first issue dvd. The first one was loaded with extras and came nicely packaged in two discs. It sold for 9.99. This new version comes crammed in a single, double-sided disk for your inconvenience.

B000WCDI5K|4.0|So far The Killers have made their mark on the mainstreem music circut. What better way to keep themselves on top than this new release 'Sawdust'. While there is no actual new material on this cd, this band wanted to give the fans a little taste from their archives before their new cd drops next spring. It's not as catchy as the songs on their two studio albums, but The Killers did something that not many bands actually do. They put all their B-sides as well as 3 rare songs on including the dance mix of Mr. Brightside which I have been looking for for such a long time! It's definitly a nice add to the collection and I am very eager to see what the third album has in store.
B00006F7S4|5.0|May I console you with the serenity of such serendipitously surfacing, sad simplicity? Tracks one through twelve of this album have delved deeply in discreetly capturing me completely. \\"Lonesome Tears\\" being my favorite track (number four amongst the sulky selections of this CD's song succession) ascribed concretely helps to highlight the additional baggage, even about my own unfolding inner savage; where in bitter contradiction it exists, although always displayed to be better dismissed (through such literary sumptuousness as this) oh-so-sweetly.    Remaining as an emotionally pressed violin to my spiritually fleshed heart's unconditionally chartered eccentricity of a chin, Beck's \\"Sea Change\\" strikes the strings with striking introspection unbounded; as the bow about all that we refuse to ever sound breathes and bends for only the furtherance of upwardly falling notes to be founded faithfully in the now of assimilative ascension conscientiously again.

If you never seen it before, just look past the puppets and imagine real people, I'm sure you'll find something to laugh at then.
B000G8NXYG|5.0|This is a tremendous presentation package of one of the seminal works of the genre and those which followed (i.e., The Magnificent Seven, The Dirty Dozen (a weak cousin), etc.      I highly recommend it for the collector.

B00000255F|5.0|Bruce Springsteen's Born To Run (1975) is one of the greatest rock albums of all-time in my book, and an existential conceptual masterpiece. It opens with the exuberance and hopefulness of innocence, travels through triumphs and disappointments, and ends with innocence lost. Just as he does on all of his albums, The Boss makes you feel as if you belong in these songs and that you are a part of it all. It begins with one of Springsteen's best songs, Thunder Road. A harmonica and piano accompany the album's first few lines.<br /><br />The screen door slams, Mary's dress sways<br />Like a vision she dances across the porch<br />As the radio plays Roy Orbison singing for the lonely<br /><br />the funky and autobiographical Tenth Avenue Freeze-Out, and the workingman's release, Night, are also very good, and embody the the album's innocent phase. That innocence is tattered in Backstreets, which chronicles a special and passionate love affair that ends badly. The hit title song, Born To Run, is a roaring and poetic anthem of living for the moment and escaping the prison of unfulfilled dreams. It's the exciting high point of the album's concept. Then those dreams are crushed in the puzzling She's The One. At first listen, this sounds like a celebration of finding the right woman, but it's much more dismal.<br /><br />But there's this angel in her eyes<br />That tells such desperate lies<br />And all you want to do is believe her<br />And tonight you'll try just one more time<br />To leave it all behind and break on through<br /><br />More seduction than woman, she keeps you from following your dreams, whatever \\"she\\" is. The downward spiral continues with Meeting Across The River, the story of two small-time hustlers who get in over their heads, and face a do-or-die situation with big-league criminals. The Boss sings their story while a piano and trumpet play a slow, jazzy duet. Jungleland closes Born To Run with a two-part street opera that's divided by an inspiring Clarence Clemons saxophone solo augmented with orchestration and lead guitar. The song takes us from the excitement of the street's magic to the acceptance of the night's reality.<br /><br />And in the quick of the night<br />They reach for their moment<br />And try to make an honest stand<br />But they wind up wounded not even dead<br />Tonight in Jungleland.nd lead guitar.

1582701709|5.0|The Secret  Came into my life at a very crucial time.  It is a wonderful book to read and pass on.  I have already recommended it to several family and friends
B000VI04HK|3.0|Excellent!      The rating would have been a 5 star, but Amazon seems to be shipping on the cheap, sending CD's out in envelopes that result in broken CD's and jewel cases or really scarred cardboard cases.  Amazon seems to be on the decline.
032147404X|5.0|I found this book very informative.  He's humurous approach is sometimes distracting but I guess this makes reading more fun. I couldn't believe that such basic things could be so much more! Book is not like other materials which makes a beginner overwhelmed. I've read so many books, but his book, made me understand and comprehend more what the other books I read meant (hope this doesn't confuse anyone reading this).  For me, it gave that, \\"so, now I understand what the other book was talking about\\".  I just hope there was more..but I suppose Book 2 would provide that :)   Beginners would definitely find this book very useful and a good tool to start learning.  I suggest before reading anything else, start with this one first, light but informative.  Will teach you the basics which would be a good building block.
B000GRUS22|5.0|no. double wow. no. triple wow.  I like all of Cretu's albums.  This on is probably my favorite.  I can understand why some don't like it, but those that don't like it, probably can't hang with variety.  it's very different, by his standards.    P.S. Get a good sound system to play this well
B000Y179KO|5.0|I was a senior in high school when I feverishly waited for Pegasus Records in Bountiful, Utah to place \\"The Long Run\\" on the shelf.  I was the first of my friends to have a listen to this wonderful work.  There is a contagious genius in those tracks; addicting just like \\"Hotel California.\\"  For 28 years I have waited to reconnect with the Eagles.    After first listen, those 28 years have melted away, and I now feel there is a continuum in the Universe.  The stories go on; introspective questions are posed; with seductive vocals and riffs from Joe, nothing has been lost to age, and production is top notch.    Just the title cut alone is worth the amazingly reasonable price of admission.  Did I mention that Joe's guitar work here is haunting.    Congratulations for self publication.      It is damn good!
B0002N4ZEW|4.0|I found \\" Voyage 34\\" to be an album nice to listen to when you want ambient music in the area. Not an album to sample Porcupine Tree's deverse talents from.The second and third tracks are trance themes. As nice a melody as they are they get to be redundant over the lenth of time. Being a fan of PT's music today it was nice to hear the musical genesis of their early stuff compared to the different style and sound they have today.
0375847227|2.0|The first book, The Golden Compass, was very good and very well done I would highly recommend it. If all the series had been on this level I would have ranked this Trilogy five stars.  Nearly all of the positive reviews I read are from people who are basing their reviews SOLELY on the first book,  although they claim their review represents the trilogy. The second book; The Subtle Knife, and third book; The Amber Spyglass, (SPOILER) are very badly written.These last two book have serious grammar issues and seem to take an almost paranoid anti-Christian view. The second and third book are about some crazy conspiracy which show fallen angels as the good side.  I have to admit it was as if these two books were written by a completely different author than the first, a writer with serious mental health issues. In this book God has taken off and left the angles in charge. The devil is a woman and who fights on the side of good. The first angle is running things and has gone mad and thinks he is God. With regard to the 2nd and 3rd books I would not recommend them to a small child. Not just because of the violence, bad grammar but because they suck. The writer Mr. Pullman, I later found out, has been described as one of England's most outspoken atheists. His extreme atheist views or a Bipolar disorder are the only possible explanations of  these last two books. I expect my review to receive negative marks simply because I stated 2nd and 3rd books were anti-Christian.

B000VLE3IS|5.0|Buy this CD/DVD set if you want to hear Led Zep at their sonic finest.  It sounds great, the DVD is a great insight into Zep in concert.  The 5.1/DTS mixes are a nice touch.  Today's bands pale in comparison--this set brings it on home..
0571225381|5.0|\\"The Remains of the Day\\" by Kazuo Ishiguro makes no compromises in telling a story about someone who only lived to work as a Butler, but never  got the chance to actually 'live', love or enjoy life outside his Butler existence. All the Butler, Mr. Stevens, knows is how to serve others, be a perfect butler, and consequently turns to his memories to rationalize his wasted existence and find the will to live through 'remains of the day' when his 'good old butler days' are over. Read the book and you'll see the poor Butler reality come life before your very eyes. Enjoy!

0446343129|5.0|Written in the late 70's this book is well documented.  It is not simply the raving of one man but a voice that suffered a great deal as a result of his addiction to drugs and sugar.  It is a book that tells many stories.  If you take him seriously, you will be challenged as my wife and I were to change the way you do food.  Enriched and fortified is everywhere.  So what?  It begs the age old question: can man make things better than God?  Natural foods is not just a store or another choice out there.  After reading this book, I have found that there are serious consquences for violating the way food was made to be eaten.  In the end you will want to speak up for those who suffer ignorantly from the devastating effects of the sugar blues.

B000VL9XE2|5.0|And possibly the best in this decade. Dillinger is operating on a level of greatness that is approached by very few. They do whatever they want and every album is so far ahead of what their peers are doing. They are a real band in a time when few exist. The certain \\"it\\" factor that bands like Tool, NIN, and Faith No More possessed in the nineties, I really only see in this decade in Dillinger and Radiohead. They really are in an elite class and this album is another mindblowing addition to the deep and rewarding body of work that they have already put out. This is an album that is more like a journey than a collection of songs. Unbelievable.
B000092ZYX|3.0|Well at least Radiohead are coming back from the stars to the topsoil.  I fell in love with Radiohead when they released The Bends and OK Computer.  Why The Bends didn't capture the world will always mystify me.  With OK Computer it was a different affair, an album that truly snuck up on me and knocked me off of my feet.    Radiohead know quite well what they are good at but I wonder what made them so motivated to deconstruct themselves.  On one level with Kid A and Amnesiac I could almost understand it.  At 1st listen these albums were a treat but nothing stuck or made them even remotely memorable.  That's either Radiohead's brilliance or my inability to dig deeper into the music.  The truth lies in the middle.    With Hail to the Thief, the boys are coming back down to their roots in noticeable ways.  There are constructed songs that show some form of one or the other.  I like the album but there is a definite thread of the trademark Radiohead dissonance and disaffection.  And I have to say this \\"trademark\\" is getting all so...tired.    In some ways I appreciate it but it other ways it dissappoints me.  I see and hear growth musically but I have to admit that I have a hard time seeing growth in their views and their arrangements and the wonderful career that they have constructed.    I almost feel that I have outgrown them.    I was complaining to a friend the other day that Radiohead are just too sad and cut off these days.  Where is their evolution?  I just don't see, feel or hear it any more.  And my friend said: \\"Well what do you want?  It's Radiohead.\\"    Sigh...are we to expect nothing else?
B000UNYJXQ|4.0|I just finished watching SiCKO last night and what I went away thinking from it was: \\"How sad.\\"  It is sad that our own citizens get put out of hospitals because they cannot afford the healthcare and do not have insurance.  It is sad when our own citizens who acted bravely and heroically on 9/11 to help others cannot even get healthcare to help themselves after being exposed to asbestos, and who knows what else, from the remnants of the World Trade Center.  It is sad when our own citizens have to LEAVE the country to obtain decent healthcare....<br /><br />Once again, Michael Moore presents the American public with a thought-provoking argument for improved healthcare in this country.  Whether one believes in socialized medicine or not, Moore tends to let the people tell their stories and let them speak for themselves.  But, Moore does more than that.  He exposes a couple other issues, apart from healthcare, that many Americans want to turn a blind eye to: class divisions and the control that the media has on the people of this country.  As usual, the poor get dumped or left behind, the middle class get squeezed to the brims of their pockets, and the rich just keep getting richer, and this applies also to healthcare.  The media exacerbates these class divisions by presenting half-truths, and lots of prescription drug commercials, to entice and inspire more people to go to the doctor and get pills to pop everyday, thus lining the pockets of the drug companies that control the media.  It is all a vicious cycle, and one that Moore tries to expose through his documentary, albeit it being subtle in its approach.<br /><br />In the end, Europe must be doing something right.  The EURO is higher than the dollar, people seem to be happier with more vacations and less workhours with the same, or more, pay, and they have universal healthcare that seems to be working so well that we Americans are going over there for treatment.  Maybe we need to take a lesson from them, and Moore makes this abundantly clear from his visits to the UK and France, and his interviews with Americans living there.  SiCKO is a very interesting film, and whether you like Moore's approach or not, it still makes you think and ponder (and research) the facts for yourself.  Highly recommended!undantly clear from his visits to the UK and France, and his interviews with Americans living there.

B000TXZVGQ|5.0|Really, you can't call youself a MSCL fan if you don't already own this DVD set.  I of course preordered it and was excited to see that it arrived to me on the day it came out.      My love for MSCL started when I was 12 years old in the 6th grade.  Even though I didn't then fully understand everything going on in the show, I knew their was something special about it and I immediatley grew attached to it.  I wanted to be just like Rayanne then.  I remember  Rayanne would always wear a barrette, so, not having access to one in 6th grade, I had a barrette my mom brought back from a trip to jamaica that had fake dread locks attached to it.  So I of course cut off the dreads and wore it all the time, until my teacher told me to take it off during class.    Now I'm 24, and I still am just as attached to the show as I've ever been.  I won't lie by telling you, I actaully partially bought this DVD set in the hopes that I someday pass it off to my future daughter when she turns 15.  I think the show will be just as relevant in 15 years as it is now, don't you?  I'll tell her just to look past the dated clothing.
B000002H97|1.0|I listened to it once in 1991 and gave it away. Why would I listen to it again when it's so mediocre? Besides I can hear it on any easy classic hits radio station with Dire Straits and The Cars.
B00005JPS5|3.0|The first 30 minutes are great -- far superior to Antz as far as the writing and animation go. Unfortunately, the rest of the film reminds you exactly why Seinfeld's sitcom was only a half hour in length -- the writers simply run out of steam and the plot bites off way too much before being quickly resolved. I mean, if you're going to spend years animating a script, why not choose one that made it past a few more rounds of editing? (6/10)
B000UJ48WC|5.0|For me, all Stanley Kubrick movies are a must. From VHS to DVD and now Blu-ray... we're getting close. Saw this opening-night in theatre and it still gives me a good rush.
B000XA5K48|5.0|So maybe the story's a little chippy,but don't let it stop the rollercoaster that you hop on as soon as the movie starts. Nonstop action,one-liners,and terrific performances by Clive Owen and Paul Giamatti.Not much else to say,except that this movie is amazinggg!
B000M341QE|5.0|One of the best movies of the year.  Story plot that will boggle your mind and star cast that will dazzle you from start to finish.  We are in Boston where all protagonists reside.  We have a mix of gangsters, police detectives and each clan is trying to infiltrate the other.  It is the battle of the minds where no one is who says they are and trust is not what they can share amongst each other, even when they are (seemingly) on the same side.  I will not write what this film is about, because plot is so supurb, my elaboration would only spoil the show.  But we learn here that both law and crime are in shades of gray and there are no winners at the end.  We consider ourselves like if we can simply act as a spectators from afar.  Enjoy the show!  Thank you Martin Scorsese.
1932907009|3.0|The Rules of Movie Making.  Well, screenwriting, anyway.  Blake Snyder knows what he is doing, he has work out there.  Yet...none of the work he has out there is interesting to me.  He writes family films, mainstream films, to make money.  He does not hide this fact - you write screenplays to make money.  Which is true when you want to eat.<br />But many of the films I love don't follow the rules, or don't follow all the rules.  True, I also think Signs was a very, very bad film.  But even if they had followed his Rules, it would have still been a very, very bad film.  You should get this book to, at least, know the Basic Rules.  Even if you plan to break them.<br />Liked the cover.  And liked the humor.  But I don't think film making is a science as much as a mixture of science and art.  Rules help you stay on course but they don't tell you where you are going.  YOU need to decide on where the film is going.
B000V8I2QU|5.0|Something about this guy, Bruce--he's getting better with age. This album is dynamite, with alot of great music from him solo, and with the band backing him up. Great tunes all over this CD.Not to be missed.
B000V8I2QU|5.0|The boy is pushin' 60, and gets better every year. (Disclaimer: I'm not THAT much younger, and my songs are pretty darn good too, but not *that* good).    It takes real chops to write a topical album that'll stand up on its own. The Dixie Chicks managed it with The Long Way Home. Neil Young failed miserably with Living with War. On his latest album Bruce pulls it off, and pulls it off with such slight-of-hand -- such *magic* -- that it doesn't hit you until later just what you were rockin' down to.    His latest album, Magic, is as good as the buzz says. Musically, it's a Bruce Springsteen album that sounds suspiciously like, say, Darkness on the Edge of Town. Lyrically, Bruce just keeps getting stronger. Bruce's patter at his concerts makes his opinion of our so-called leaders clear, and the lyrics of these songs makes it even clearer... but without bashing your head in. You have to listen, and think. These are grown-up's lyrics, with all the complexity that comes with getting older and maybe a little wiser. These lyrics are the spiritual descendent of songs like Candy's Room and Born in the USA -- songs that at first glance seem to be great rockers, but then you realize that they're about something altogether darker. But these songs, in my opinion, are better. More mature. More subtle. More willing to take chances. Not every song succeeds, but enough do to make this a must-have for this music season.
6305882592|5.0|I don't think I can see this movie too many times. I first saw it in a college film class, and was completely hooked.  The acting is delightful, and Ruth Gordon is superb!   The music is perfectly matched.  It's a story about life and death, and finding the meaning of one's life. We should all have a bit of Harold and Maude in us.
0374280967|5.0|This little book assembles many things: a humorous and sometime biting look at the royal family as the average Brit imagines them to be, a little bibliographical list for readers, a rumination on the powers of the written word, and finally a debate within the author on the meaning of reading versus writing.  None of these are complex, deep philosophical debates.  But they are all very interesting and challenging.<br /><br />The characterization of the Queen is quite humorous and somewhat poignant.  It is a portrait of someone who has come upon you own identity at a point in her life where she should be very much ground in her identity and life.  The other characters within the royal household, outside of the character of Norman are all caricatures, funny caricature but caricatures nontheless.  The Duke of Windsor is the most one demensional caricature of them all, much like the real duke in the present day press.<br /><br />This was a nice book, short and sweet at 120 pages.  It was an easy and fun read and it does serve to espand one's mind and aloows one to think funny irreverent thoughts andopen up possibilities, which is what a book is all about.
0141185104|5.0|It took me a measly three hours to read John Steinbeck's classic tragedy `Of Mice and Men', a novel that, while written in 1937, still holds so true today.  Steinbeck's accounting of sheer loneliness and desperation is so brilliantly captured that the reader is brought to tears (for me in a literal sense) to realize that this is all these people had to live for, a pipe dream that refused to die.  The story focuses mainly on George Milton and Lennie Small, but as you read you'll notice that a few supporting characters play a big role in the heartbreak that this novel conveys.<br /><br />George is a small framed man, lean and dwarfed in comparison to his companion Lennie, the tall large strong man, but what Lennie has in strength and size he lacks in smarts.  He is, for lack of another word, mentally retarded.  But Lennie does possess a simple soul and a heart of gold, which alone makes this tale all the more tragic.  George, in fulfillment of a promise he made to Lennie's Aunt Clare, takes care of Lennie, taking him with him to work in the fields bucking wheat and the like.  When they make it to their next job they find that they aren't the only ones trying to find a better lot in life.<br /><br />First they meet Candy, an older man who's been injured on the job and thus kept around for sympathy's sake.  He sweeps the living areas and lives his life one miserable day at a time.  He's slipping into uselessness and the very thought of amounting to nothing digs deeper and deeper into his soul.  Crooks is the negro stable hand, an outcast from the others not only because of his skin color but also because of his disability, being crippled due to a horse accident (he was kicked in the back) and thus he spends most of his time alone in his room.  They also meet the boss's son Curly, a jerk of a man who is so insecure about his size and his marriage that he's willing to throw it down with anyone he sees, and he sets the blunt of his rage on poor Lennie because of his size and his demeanor.<br /><br />To me the most interesting and even heartbreaking character is that of Curly's wife.  Ostracized by the working men because of her husbands temper and disregarded by her own husband because of his carelessness and blatant jealousy she's left all alone with no one to talk to and no real place to call home.  She's regarded by the men as a tart, a floozy who wants all the wrong kinds of attention but in all actuality she just wants any kind of attention she can get for any kind is better than no kind.  After the tragic circumstances involving Lennie and Curly's wife the author makes a statement that to me sums up this poor woman when he says that \\"all the meanness and the planning's and the discontent and the ache for attention were all gone from her face.\\"  She was alone and desperate just like everyone else.<br /><br />The one thing that kept these stock of characters going, Lennie in particular, was the prospect of getting out, of getting their own place where they could plant and cultivate and \\"tend rabbits\\" and be their own men.  When this idea is shared between Candy and Crooks they too jump at the idea of getting away from it all and feeling whole again, feeling complete and being far away from the loneliness of it all.  The worst kind of loneliness is the kind you feel even when you're around other people for its then that you know you're truly alone in every sense of the word.<br /><br />Most people are aware of the horrific ending, but in case you are not then I will say nothing further on the subject.  Just know that this novel is one of the finest pieces of American Literature and is sure to bring tears to your eyes.  While this is just barely over 100 pages it still magnificently captures every emotion and feeling that can possibly be provided here.  The characters are brilliantly crafted and their innermost demons are bared all for us to see and to relate.  I will never forget this masterpiece and will recommend this to anyonewho enjoys good reading.  It's a quick read, but it's not one to soon be forgotten.uick read, but it's not one to soon be forgotten.
1594489505|5.0|I loved the Kite Runner but for me, it was outshone by A Thousand Splendid Suns. Hosseini is a marvelous storyteller, and in this tale he's so sensitive to the plight of women. Even though the story was often painful, I couldn't put the book down. I felt totally sympathetic for the female characters, and despised the oppressive males. It also helped me understand what Afghanistan has endured all these years, and how the people have suffered under warlords, invaders and corruption. I highly recommend A Thousand Splendid Suns.
B00012FXB8|3.0|I can honestly say I was disappointed in this film when I saw it at the cinema even leaving halfway thru for a toilet break which I never do at the cinema. I felt I would not miss anything. Anyway I recently purchased the Directors original extended version which sheds a totally different light on the film adding over 30 mins to the original theatre version..this was how this film was meant to be seen in cinemas. Thank God that directors have their dreams realised thanks to the marvels of DVD.
B000002H33|4.0|There, I said it! There are a lot of better albums around. A remix could do wonders to this CD! Note: I'm not bashing this album, for it is truly a great one, that's why Im giving it four stars. However, it is overrated.
B000NDI3SK|5.0|I can only concur with the many accolades this superb program has received over the years. Viewing it as a teen was a broadening and life-changing experience for me. Through its lens, I became fascinated by the complex interrelationships among many fields of learning and started to view the sciences as both poetry and a grand adventure. I look forward to giving the same experience to my children.<br /><br />Jacob Bronowski was truly a renaissance man, capable of synthesizing the progress of human understanding and the scientific method into lucid, beautiful essays. \\"The Ascent of Man\\" is his magnum opus and, in both written and filmed formats, required reading and viewing for all those who would hope to consider themselves educated. It's not simply a history of scientific thought; it's also a vigorous defense of humanism and a passionate assault on dogma.<br /><br />That said, the current edition, which I've checked out from the library, looks like it was mastered from mediocre Super8 film. And I'm a bit flummoxed by the price. I am disinclined to pay $100 for a box set of DVDs when the DVD set for Kenneth Clark's \\"Civilization,\\" a series comparable both in length and in excellence, costs much less. Why overcharge and thereby discourage new generations from exposing themselves to the brilliance of Bronowski?<br /><br />For that matter, why is Alistair Cooke's wonderful TV series \\"America\\" completely unavailable in America yet available in the UK? This makes no sense! Would someone at the BBC get his or her head out of the sand and release these DVDs -- properly remastered, please -- in the US?
B000VNMMQG|5.0|If you like history, you need to see this film.  If you are not a history buff, you still need to see this film, as I guarantee that you cannot and will not walk away from it unchanged!    I knew nothing of the history of the song, Amazing Grace, and certainly knew nothing about either William Wilburforce or his work as a pro-abolitionist member of Parliament, so when I saw the movie in the theater, I was doubly impressed with both of the stories told in this powerful, well-acted film.    Even if you normally don't watch \\"period films\\", take a chance on this one - you won't regret it!    This is truly a masterful piece of work, and it deserves to be seen by everyone!

B000VNMMQG|5.0|I was familiar with the story of William Wilberforce from what I read of him in Peter Marshall's From Sea to Shining Sea, and remember thinking at the time that Mr. Wilberforce should be better known for the incredible work he did to abolish the slave trade in England. It was a story of courage and sacrifice, and it seemed strange that I had never heard it before. The character of William also fascinated me. So when I saw this yesterday I literally pounced on it, knowing it had to be great. It was great, though it focused more on what Williams faith produced than on his faith itself. Beautifully filmed and thouhtfully written, the little known story of a compassionate and strong-willed young man who changed history was brought to life with an all British cast. The settings and costumes were good, and the acters were well chosen. The array of eccentric characters made it seem a bit like Dickens. Wilberforce himself was an odd man, with poor people he didn't know crowding his dining room at lunch time and all kinds of animals running around. His friend Thomas Clarkston caught my eye every time he came on screen. He didn't have many lines and never changed his expression, but Rufus Sewell can do more with a wistful, stoney glare than most actors can do with a dozen speeches. An intrigueing, dark character, greying, sandy hair swaying in the breeze beneath a scare-crow hat . . . And Pitt, another friend of Wilberforce, is convincing in a quiet way. Would watch it again just to hear his accent. The special features are as rich as the movie. Actor interviws, a music video by Chris Tomlin, and a section where a young modern-day abolitionist speaks out on slavery today. Politics often stand in the way of justice, now, as then, and this movie reminds us not to quit fighting for what's right when the tide of political sway is against you. \\"If not you, who? If not now, when?\\"
0812550706|5.0|Loved this book.  One of my favorites.  Wonderful main character and unusual setting.  I think a teenage boy would like this as much as an adult.
B000W4HJ44|5.0|I went to this movie at my \\"tween\\" daughter's request, but was completely surprised to find out that I LOVED it!! The music is fabulous and the moral of the story (stand up againist injustice) is icing on the cake. There are a few words said that we don't say in our house, but aside from that, and some more adult messages, it's a fine movie for kids. Most of the more adult messages went over my 10 year old's head. She just enjoyed the music, and of course, Zac Efron, who was a perfect \\"Link\\".
0143038419|4.0|I am in the middle of this now, and enjoying the read.   I am not a spiritual \\"seeker\\", as is the author, but it is enjoyable nonetheless.  She has a great self-deprecating humor that runs throughout in spite of the serious nature of her quest.  Others that have read it have told me they enjoyed it too.
B000HT3PPG|5.0|\\"Miracle on 34th Street\\" opens with a wonderful holiday feel to it, as the camera follows an elderly gentleman down the sidewalk of a busy Christmas holiday New York street. The scene develops into the Macy's Department Store Thanksgiving Day parade, with the elderly man discovering that the man that Macy's has hired to portray Santa is disgracefully drunk!  Doris Walker, (Maureen O'Hara) who is Macy's special events director, persuades the elderly man to take his place, telling him how much that he looks like the \\"real' Santa! The elderly man proves to be a sensation and is quickly recruited to be the store Santa at the Macy's department store!  While he is successful, Ms. Walker learns that he calls himself Kris Kringle (Edmund Gwenn) and he claims to be the actual Santa Claus! Despite reassurances by Kringle's doctor that he is harmless, Doris still has misgivings, especially when she has cynically trained herself, and also her young daughter, Susan, (Natalie Wood) to reject all notions of belief and fantasy. And yet, people, especially Susan, begin to notice there is something special about Kris and his determination to advance the true spirit of Christmas amidst the rampant commercialism around him and succeeding in improbable ways. Kris even brings together department store rivals Macy and Gimbal! When a raucous conflict with the store's cruelly incompetent psychologist erupts; Kris finds himself held at Bellevue where, in despair, he deliberately fails a mental examination to ensure his commitment. All seems lost until Doris' lawyer friend, Fred Gaily, (John Payne) reassure Kris of his worth and agrees to represent him in the fight to secure his release. To achieve that, Fred arranges a formal hearing in which he argues that Kris is sane because he is in fact the real and genuine Santa Claus!  What ensues is an incredibly entertaining hearing in which people's beliefs are reexamined and put to the test, but even so, it's going to take a miracle for Kris to win!<br /><br />\\"Miracle on 34th Street\\" (1947) has got to be one of the best and original Christmas stories ever made! You'll delight at the scene of Susan watching skeptically as Santa is talking to the children in the department store, and he talks to both the French children and a special little Dutch girl, who he also sings a song to! Susan is amazed that this man knows so much about children and even speaks different languages! The movie's finale is what makes this movie such a wonderful Christmas experience! To see an ordinary lawyer like Fred Gaily represent a seemingly ordinary man like Kris Kringle and in a brilliant moment Fred uses a government service to prove that, not only is this pleasant little man Kris Kringle, but the one and only Santa Claus! And it's all played out on Christmas Eve! You would think that after this scene that the movie would end- not so! Another wonderful scene awaits, and will have you saying, along with Susan, Doris, and Fred- \\"He REALLY is Santa Claus!!\\"n!    \\"Miracle on 34th Street\\" (1947) has got to be one of the best and original Christmas stories ever made!

B00000637V|1.0|Being a fan of multiple genres, artists, styles I always keep an open mind when listening to things the first time.  Having got this on loan from the library, what resonated was how how glad I was I didn't actually pay for this dreadful album.  The writing, singing and playing is uninspired, formulaic and displays little talent.  Reading the various reviews causes me to wonder how someone could give this five stars, or four or three...Thankfully I don't \\"get\\" it.  Not having smoked, drank or ingested some other type of substance likely had something to do with that.  That is the only way I could conceive getting anything out of this and might explain others getting any pleasures out this subpar effort.  People, there is so much better music out there than to waste your time on this!
B000TEUSJK|3.0|I had only previously seen the R rated version and was curious to see the full edition of the movie.  Well, now that my curiosity has been quenched, I don't have any desire to see this movie again.  I would have rather rented the film, but didn't have the option.
B000VI70X6|5.0|Shakira is one of the biggest stars around, the Oral Fixation Tour while not the flashiest of concerts, focused on Shakira's music and unique stage presence.  Some have complained that the show was not flashy enough, not enough lights and props, yet we are constantly bombarded with pop tart concerts filled with sound effects and dancers that take away or rather distract the audience from the music or lack there of.  Shakira as a real artist is able to showcase her range and talent throughout the DVD.  With few costume changes and an intimate setting Shakira was able to connect with the crowd and show viewers what she is really made of.    She seamlessly transitions from pop star, to rocker, to nostalgic romantic to hipshaker throughout the DVD. The added documentaries are a nice touch and allow Shakira to explain to fans old and new the meaning and reason behind her foundation Pies Descalzos.
B000PGTPE6|5.0|I ordered this after hearing one cut on XM radio.  I'm not usually a Springsteen fan as he was a little after my era but I love this album.  It comes with two audio cd's and a video dvd with everything from both cd's. The band behind him is part dixieland, part country, and part Klezmer - tuba, trombones, trumpet, slide guitar, fiddle.  The tunes include several folksy standards. It's just fun.[[ASIN:B000PGTPE6 Live In Dublin (2CD/DVD)]]
B000HWZ4CA|5.0|This is a great film. My husband loves it, he watched it the night he recieved it.  Thanks for carrying these old film.
B000VBJEFK|5.0|So, video is unbelievable on the BD as played by my Samsung BD-P1400. One or two glitches, probably do to Java interactions (dumb to design a DVD around Java!!!!). One complaint, but doesn't lower my rating, is that there isn't (at least that I could find) advanced audio on this BD... where's the Dolby Digital Plus, or Dolby Digital True HD, or DTS-HDMA???? Really too bad...<br />but a great fun time to watch!!!
B000005S5N|5.0|I bought this (vinyl) album around October 1986 when I was 20, now 21 years later in 2007 it still sounds great! I was in a second-hand record shop today and there it was, the original album in pristine condition! I thought about buying it but since I already have the original album and the CD version I thought why deprive someone else of a great album, so I left the shop without it...that's how good it is! Morten, Mags and Pal, take a bow! 11/10 !
0312857063|5.0|Terry Goodkind has written a spellbinding series.  His character descriptions paint a picture in your mind and the action is fast paced.  This is only the second in the series and I look forward to getting all the follow on books.
0316067598|5.0|In a world were few know and fewer care, this book opens the eyes of those who read it.  With an open mind and a respect for the men and women of our armed forces, the reader is brought to the Hindu Kush where the firefight takes place.  This is an amazing depiction of the fighting   and the brave men that fought for our freedom.      How nice it must be for the 18 or so \\"1 star'ers\\" to have this freedom granted them by Marcus and his \\"brothers\\". How thoughtfully they use this freedom to put thier ignorant condicention on display.      Thank you brave men and women.  Know that your time and effort is not wasted on me.    Thank you for your service to this great country.  Your efforts will never be forgotten.
0525950079|5.0|Much like Pillars of the Earth, Follett has once again conjured a story that is totally absorbing and keeps one interested.  His comfortable writing style enables the reader to feel a part of the story, engrossed in how the characters will handle their next challenges.  He goes into less architectural detail than Pillars which results in more story line and a tale that is full of action.  This is a great book which demonstates Mr. Follett's mastery as a story teller.
B000VBJEEG|5.0|This movie is cute and I found Remy adorable. I just didn't like his rat relatives. I thought Ratatouille was aname Pixar made up, but then I found out it's acually a casserole dish made in France. I found an easy recipe on line and made it. Ratatouille has a lot of layered vegetables in it: zucchini, eggplant, mushrooms, and tomatoes with parmesan cheese sprinkled over each layer of vegetables. Wonderful movie! Delicious dish!

B00005JPRD|5.0|All I can say that hasn't already been said is:  If you truly LOVE the Beatles' music and/or movies [especially if you're a Boomer!] you absolutely MUST see this movie or you're missing the cinematic event of a lifetime... This film is destined to become a classic. I read that Paul McCartney and Ringo Starr BOTH previewed the film and offered their \\"approval\\" for its release.  My only complaint is the limited theater release prevented my seeing it more than once on the big screen.  This film is one of my all-time favorites, and I VERY impatiently await the DVD release!!!!!!
B000VL9XE2|1.0|This CD is a concept of a real bully in Greg Piscato or whatever the roid boy's name is. He's not a friendly person and he proudly presents it on this concept CD:<br /><br />  1.

Mouth Of Ghosts - Thats what Greg wants you to think!
0307276902|2.0|I agree with other reviews that the story was not that original.. Even if the book was a little made up.. the made up story was not that big of deal. I applaud the guy for beating his addiction, but I did not find the story that moving. He did write well, and it seemed real(in short phrases to keep the story moving - how an addict may think) -james stated on Oprah. Maybe it was his perspective of how he told his own story that was not intriguing to me...Although, I do understand how this story can be so moving to someone in a situation like his... \\"hold on\\"
055312420X|4.0|There are a lot of books out there (and movies, and TV specials, etc.) about depression, but too often I feel the disorder is glamorized into some kind of melancholic artistic reverie. \\"The Bell Jar\\" is not one of those books.     From the start, the narrator is believable and even likeable. Plath, writing form her own experiences with breakdowns and hospitalization, creates a fully developed and complex, even at times humorous character to whom I could relate. The story moves along well, doesn't sag, and the ending, though ambiguous, makes the story all the more realistic--there is no definitive end to depression, and the story mirrors that well.     As always, I appreciated the fact that it was not a feel-good book; Plath is not one given to sappy interludes and touchy-feely sessions between the characters. It's spare, yet it resonates with human feeling and human frustration.
0525950079|5.0|I'm sure other reviews have discussed the plot and characters in this masterfully crafted tome, so I'll try a different tack; I'll focus on the experience of what it's like to read this work instead.     This book is neither original, nor for that matter, profound, but by God, it is indisputably an intoxicating and bewitching tale. On entertainment value alone, I'd say this book is, without a doubt, an utter masterpiece; it is a captivating tale that holds you spellbound from the very first, to the very last, word. A word, I should note, that just happens to appear some 1,000 pages later.     A 1,000 pages sounds like a lot, doesn't it? But you know what? The book won't seem that long though; hell it won't even seem like you're reading a 500 page book. You'll be so engrossed in the tale, that you'll continually find either yourself reading it or craving to do so, and before you know it, there won't be a single delectable page left to read; there were several occasions, where I was planning on reading a few pages due to time constraints, but as soon as I started reading I couldn't tear myself away from it, and ended up reading well over a 100 pages each time.     The story is as addictive as a soap opera; we become through immersed in the lives and world of the four principal characters of this novel - Merthin, Caris, Gwenda, and Ralph. We are introduced to them as children, and watch the trials and tribulations, and the triumphs and tragedies that they encounter as they grow older. Each character has their own distinct storyline, but Follett effortlessly weaves all four together to create an even more brilliantly engaging tale about life in the Middle Ages in general.     Think of the whole story as a finished painting. Now think of each character's storyline, as occupying distinct sections of the canvass. When all these elements are fused together, what emerges is something more than just a picture or good storytelling. What emerges is an utterly astounding work ofliterary greatness; a picture, all would concede is a masterpiece. The discovery of this literary greatness is the experience awaiting you in this book.     Perhaps, the highest acolyte that I could bestow on this book is that it is such a mesmerizing read, I would have gladly welcomed another 1,000 pages of story. However, since this book was not 2,000 page epic, I'll have to settle for the next best thing; I will now be devoting my attention towards eagerly devouring this book's prequel, The Pillars of the Earth. For those of you like me, that have yet to read this book, there is nothing in World Without End that depends on having read The Pillars of the Earth; the story in each book are basic self-contained; some of the principle characters and the deeds they accomplished from The Pillars of the Earth are mentioned in World Without End and that is it.
B000WCBMA8|3.0|I've always loved the hives, after the new bomb turks called it quits they were supposed to take over as the greatest r & r band, but they failed to reach that plateau on this album.  The rockin' songs still rock but the other half of this album is boring, experimental crap that sounds forced and unnatural.  Hopefully the hives will return to form on the next record and we can forgive this weak effort.

0765316889|5.0|Mistborn 2: The Well of Ascension is a book that I was somewhat weary of... sequels never did go to well with me, especially when the last book ended with such a powerful note.  But I couldn't deny the air of mystery that went unsolved in the first book.  The book started with a logical and chaotic aftermath that brought a high tension to the book.  Brandon Sanderson's typical writing style where the book starts as a slow somewhat enjoyable read and builds up to an awesome ending that blows the world away.  By the end of the book I lost all control and was in love, I've been recommending Sanderson for sometime now ever sense I read Elantris, but after Mistborn I call him my favorite all-time author.  5/5 stars for an awesome intense ride that builds in tension and doesn't release till the last book.  What I love as well, is how he solves the main conflict of the second book, but leaves a new air of mystery for the second.  That made it all the more incredible.
B000VLOKQI|5.0|This is an autobiography DVD. You want full concert songs, buy the bonus DVD from Best Buy. This is the story of The Who, by Pete and Roger. It is very well done, and keeps you interested throughout. Anyone who finds fault with this DVD just isn't really a Who fan. Incredible. Long Live Rock!
0316010669|4.0|This book was recommended to me by a friend, Rory, a fellow student in the doctoral program in Leadership Studies at Gonzaga University.  What a totally amazing book.  I was intrigued and spellbound the entire time.    \\"The Theory of Thin Slices: How a Little Bit of Knowledge Goes a Long Way\\" is the driving theme for this book.  Malcolm Gladwell, also author of \\"The Tipping Point\\", incorporates ample research and rich detail to add depth to the discussion of the incredible ability of the human mind to make split second decisions.  He explains how our neurolinguistic program plays a role in our interpretations of the world around us before our conscious mind ever catches on to the automatic decisions that have guided us to survival or success.  Whether we are judging the authenticity of an ancient work of art or selecting an ideal mate, the automatic decision maker often selects a better decision for us than we have consciously derived after hours of discourse and deliberations.  This book is about those \\"thin slices\\", decisions made literally in the blink of an eye.      Technology has come a long way in helping us to understand how the mind works.  An understanding of these complex concepts helps us to interpret the decisions and actions that we make in our daily interactions with others.  A better understanding of these concepts might help us to change how we train and educate leaders for a more ethically sensitive society.  The author continues to add depth to substantiate the thesis through many interesting examples and research studies.    I highly recommend this book.

I've read House To House, My War, and others before that, which I can't remember the name of, and when it comes to a providing a first-hand perspective of the conflicts of this decade, either in Iraq or Afghanistan, this one takes the cake.

There is also a helpful section on different tools used in the recipes.
0373771665|5.0|Wonderful Regency England romance novel.<br /><br />What sets a Heyer book apart from more modern romances, is Heyer is able to craft a romance story without even resorting \\"into the bedroom\\". She is able to create incredible sexual tension between the characters, with nothing more than a kiss being exchanged between the hero and heroine.<br /><br />In Venetia, we come across a lively and very likeable heroine named, what else, Venetia! She is engaging and cheerful, never one to complain about one's circumstances. In this case, she is confirmed \\"on the shelf\\" at the age of 25, looking after a younger brother while her other brother has his adventures in the Army in Europe. She has spent her entire life in the countryside of York on her family's estate, content to overseeing her home and finding adventures only in the books she reads.<br /><br />When one day, Venetia encounters the hero Lord Damerel, a libertine and notorious rake, at his estate and her life is never the same. Damerel is cynical and hardened at 38, a confirmed bachelor who's lifestyle of decadence and extravagence has made him a social outcast among the ton. After his encounter with innocent Venetia, he decides to stay for a time in the country to seduce her (what else would a rake do?lol), but in turn becomes seduced himself by Venetia's wit, charm, and intelligence and inevitably falls in love with her.<br /><br />If this is your first foray into Heyer territory, I would definitely recommend Venetia to start your journey.=)
B00003CWPL|4.0|If not understanding a movie will make you dislike it, chances are you will not like this movie. I've seen it about 3 times and still don't really \\"get\\" it. I have some ideas, but this is really a strange film. There's a lot of seemingly random stuff that happens. Whether it is or not, I have no idea. With Lynch it can be hard to tell.    That being said, this is an interesting watch. At first I thought it was ridiculous, but I decided to give it another try, with a different way of thinking about it. To my surprise, that actually worked really well. Trying to piece together the meaning behind all the bizarre occurences, the soundtrack, the imagery: all of these are very appealling to the right type of person.    The soundtrack, especially when Henry is outside, is a little creepy. It can very easily crawl under your skin and rearrange your psyche. Be careful with it. :-)    The black-and-white imagery at first made me a little iffy. I generally dislike black-and-white films, because they're so limited. Most of the time I prefer very \\"specific\\" colors, used in an artistic fashion. The contrast in Eraserhead, though, is really quite interesting, even striking in some places. It's different from many black-and-white films, in a very good way.    For most people, it's not the kind of thing you can watch over and over and never get tired of it, unless you're trying really hard to figure it out. Even then you'd probably burn yourself out and maybe go crazy.    The bottom-line: If you're into surrealism (really into it, not just pretending to look cool) you will probably find something to enjoy in this.  If you like being able to understand something easily, if you want a coherent plot, if you want a Hollywood movie, you shouldn't waste your time with this one.
B000WCDI5K|5.0|I have waited patiently for this album to be released.  Some tracks I've heard already in 2 of their shows this year such as Shadow Play (by Joy Division).  Youtube can show you their talent from Abbey Road, where Romeo and Juliet, amongst a few other tracks were recorded.  For an American band, The Killers are simply amazing and energizing.  With Mr. Brightside being their first track I've witnessed on VH1 years ago, it is still a popular song amongst fans.      I strongly recommend front row attendance at their shows to see Brandon's exciting performance supported by the rest of the guys.
B000OV170W|3.0|Honestly, I bought this book because I needed a good satisfying cry, and the subject matter seemed to have potential for to that end.  The main character, Anna, is a \\"designer baby\\" whose genetic material was chosen specifically because she is an exact match for her older sister Kate,who has leukemia. For the past 13 years, whenever Kate has needed platelets or bone morrow, Anna has had to be the donor.  When Kate needs a kidney, Anna finds a lawyer to sue her parents for medical emancipation so she can make her own medical choices.<br /><br />Although Picoult's storytelling and characters have certain melodramatic affectations, the roles of love and death in this book are prominent enough to give some excuse. My Sister's Keeper had me hooked from when I first opened it, and in fact, I finished in one day, so it's a very easy read. However the storylines get drawn out too long with each character, so the suspense gets a little stale, by the time the court case ends, we feel a \\"well, it's about time!\\" sentiment, rather than a reaction to the judgement itself. (Certainly, we're not suprised)<br /><br />The ending is terrible. The whole point of the story until the ending is Anna's need to be consulted for choices reguarding her body. And the end takes that away. I was left feeling angry and puzzled more than sad, because the end doesn't fit the story - thematically or stylistically. It feels like it was tacked on because the author herself could not figure out what Anna would choose, so the ending is mechanical rather than character or plot driven.<br /><br />That said, this book did make me cry, so it served it's purpose.
B000VBJEFK|5.0|This is a wonderful movie for all the family. The storyline is strong and the picture quality and audio quality are reference standards for high definition media - in this case Blu-Ray. Until you watch the commentary by Brad Bird and others you cannot appreciate the incredible job the animators did in this movie. Watch the movie and then the commentary - then go back and watch the movie again. It's worth it.
0393312836|5.0|Anthony Burgess is one of my favorite writers.  He is an extraordinary novelist, essayist, and a very interesting (though overly pompous at times) person.  He wrote over 40 novels during his lifetime, which is remarkable considering he didn't start until his late 30's.  This is (obviously) his most famous novel, which he found somewhat annoying, as there were other books he was most proud of, but it's still a great novel, worthy of all its praise.  I especially like this new edition, which eliminated the Nadsat glossary (which was included in the initial American version of the book), and it reinstates the 21st chapter, which Kubrick didn't know about until filming was well under way.  The final chapter works very well.  It makes perfect sense that Alex would indeed grow weary of his punk/violent teenage days.  Occasionally, people refuse to grow up, but more often than not, they do mature and decide that things they did as youths were ridiculous and naive.  Youth, in my opinion, has always been terribly overrated (something Burgess agrees with), and that as one grows in experience and time, wisdom comes (for most, anyway), and that the silliness of youth can be set aside for a more intelligent, thoughtful, and open minded stance on life.  I feel the older you get, the more liberal and open minded you become, because you see more things and feel more things.  I really do like that final chapter quite a bit.<br /><br />Ironically, when the novel was released in Britain, the reviews were brutal, especially over the Nadsat language.  The reviewers felt that Burgess was committing sacrelige on the English language (which was ridiculous).  The American critics, however, loved the work, praising it for its vision and its inventions in language.  The American publisher did insist on adding the glossary (against Burgess's wishes), and cutting off the final chapter, which they felt softened Burgess's argument.  The final chapter makes it more of a fable (something Burgess talks about in his new intro \\"A Clockwork Orange Resucked\\"), but without the final chapter, the ending is creepier and more ambiguous.  Usually it's the opposite with editing for an American audiences.  Publishers/distributors dumb down for American audiences (when I don't think they should), but here, dropping the final chapter did make the ending darker.<br /><br />The book and the film should be read and seen as often as possible.  Kubrick wouldn't have been able to make such a great film without such strong source material.  And the differences between the film and the book are quite minor compared to most other adaptations.  Read the book, see the film, and repeat.out in his new intro \\"A Clockwork Orange Resucked\\"), but without the final chapter, the ending is creepier and more ambiguous.

B000HCO83Q|5.0|I love all 3 X-Men movies. Unlike some other trilogies, where plots weaken with sequels, I found all 3 X-Men movies full of action, and not just cheesy computer effects. The characters are very engaging, and the underlying message of the movie is not missed.
B000F0UUT6|5.0|I love Pride and Prejudice, and seeing Colin Firth as Mr. Darcy was the icing on the cake!  I highly recommend it!
B00006ADFL|5.0|Reading Peter Jackson's excellent biography recently \\"A filmaker's journey\\" has inspired me to watch his back-catalogue of films. As a huge fan of Peter ever since \\"the Frightener's\\" (which incidently was made in my home town in New Zealand, Lyttelton) I really enjoyed \\"Heavenly Creatures\\" It's certainly different from his earlier films but this had me totally engaged throughout.<br /><br />Peter is a masterful storyteller/filmaker. Highly recomended.
B0002O7XWC|5.0|i watched this work of art in Film as literature yesterday and i was hypnotized. when my teacher said we wear going to watch easy rider i was exited because i had always wanted to see it and oh god this movie is to good to be true, from the style, the cinematography and the narrative, to the fantastic soundtrack. i have always thought Dennis Hopper was a genius and after seeing this i am positive. this film goes so well with the authors i've been reading, Kerouac, Burroughs, Ginberg, and Hunter s. Thompson. oh how i wish i could live as these authors and captain america and billy lived, to travel on an endless journey of self discovery, but i can't due to laws against hitchhiking, camping wherever and freedom, how i wish i lived in their era. i can't, so i live these dreams through books and movies such as this. buy Easy rider its an american masterpiece.
0525950079|3.0|I adored Pillars of the Earth and was thrilled when I heard Follett had written a sequel.  Unfortunately, I am on page 351, and while I will keep reading, it is just more like a tutorial on medieval life than a work of gripping fiction.  The dialogue is banal and the rest of the writing lacks nuance or literary interest. It's cheesey and obvious, but I am ever hopeful that at some point along this very long road, the writing will get better and it will all be worth the wait.
B000Y179KO|5.0|I'm not going to ramble on and on but this album is fantastic. The vocals and harmonies, to me especially Glenn Frey's, are like great comfort food and are classic Eagles. It's so great to get some new music from these guys. I don't care what The Big Lebowski thinks. I am gladly adding these songs to the soundtrack of my life.
B000002GQH|5.0|So many great albums by this band and this one stands out as my favorite. Probably the Moody Blues album that most constantly reminds me of Pink Floyd and Jethro Tull in places and seems to be heavily influenced by both bands. Check out the song you would mistake for Tull if you are only slightly familiar with Tull. Tull fans just laugh like I did. Anyway if you love progressive rock you will need this album in your collection without question. The concept and storyline put this ahead of its time and progressive albums were not normally like this till the 70s. Very much unlike other albums of its time and a giant leap for the Moody Blues. Every bit as influential to progressive rock as King Crimson in 1969.The Moodys will never get enough credit for establishing the progressive rock genre and this album is proof of that all the way through.
B000VLE3IS|3.0|There is a serious problem with the packaging for the limited edition deluxe edition. There are no plastic CD trays within the package. Instead, the discs are wedged tightly between the foldout card backing of the packaging and a similar stock overlay featuring pictures of each member. This design caused my discs to be scratched upon removal from the packaging - there just wasn't enough room to slide them out. The configuration of the packaging leaves cardboard edges exposed where the discs slide in and out. This causes repeated scratches when removing and replacing the discs.     Visually, the design is fine; however, the function is seriously compromised. Scratched discs suck. Bruce Springsteen's Magic CD packaging had similar problems with its sleeved package, but it left a little more room to maneuver the CD out of the package than Zeppelin's and didn't have the exposed edges.     5 stars for the remastering - it sounds good. 3 stars for the song selection - matter of preference. 0 stars for the packaging.
B000002J1O|5.0|This album is just about everything that you can love or is great about progressive rock! You will know why everyone lives this album 5 stars after listening because this is some of the best music you will ever hear. It is a crime Genesis did not become as famous as they would later become with this album. This album is by far the most sophisticated album Genesis ever did and they would never do anything this great again though they were still incredible later on. Firth on Fifth will blow you away as well as Cinema Show which are the types of songs that made classic Genesis a premier Progressive Rock act forever. This is the album that puts Genesis on the level of greatness of Jethro Tull and only the best of the best progressive rock bands! This is as experimental as a Pink Floyd album and as sophisticated as and rock band can get near Mozart or 18th century classical masterpieces which this rivals all the way and totally rocks dude!
B000040OBS|5.0|This a group that was well aware of The Stooges and The Velvets before Bowie was involved in producing Reed and Pop. The Residents were also working in a similar fashion and in similar venues at the same time Suicide were.     David Lynch's name comes up when people want to describe the music, and any of their songs would've been great in any of his movies.     The music has this hypnotic quality (keep in mind this was the 70s and overlook the \\"Casio sound\\", but it shows you can sound great on a shoestring budget) with an in your face attitude out front. Every song on here could be covered, but \\"Ghost Rider\\", \\"Cheree\\" are prob. the most \\"commercial\\",but I think the songs are well written. Pretty dark stuff overall.     Suicide and Television in my opinion are overlooked, yet you can name just about every modern rock band after 1977 and they will mention having this one, because they were signed to a UK based record company. They do get mention in Don Letts' fairly recent documentary on punk.     This isn't a walk on the wild side. This is the true soundtrack for the \\"Summer of Sam\\" in my opinion.      The epic \\"Frankie Teardrop\\" influenced Springsteen's \\"Nebraska\\" (who would cover their \\"Dream Baby Dream\\" in 2005...showing that the Boss is a bona fide music geek), but the screams will jolt you out of the chair if you have it turned up.     You'll either really love it or really hate it. There's no in between.
B000VBJEFK|5.0|I really enjoyed this Blu Ray disc. The picture is clear and crisp beyond belief. You can even see the wiskers curl on Emy's face . My only beef is Disney had way too many previews also the film takes about 2- 3 minutes to begin playing or going from one menu to the next. I don't have to wait this long with other Blu Ray titles.     In defense of Disney they do advise you of the delay so I can't really fault them.    Overall this is the type of disc you will want to watch over and over again just to appreciate the attention to detail and colors in hi-def    I support both formats and this is definitely one of the best discs out there so far. Period    Enjoy!
0439882826|5.0|AMAZING...AMAZING...AMAZING...AMAZING!!!  This is by far the most creative POP-UP book related to Star Wars ever published.  Matthew Reinharrt equals his genius partner Robert Sabuda in developing the STAR WAR SAGA in 3D.  The only question I have is why this masterpiece is so reasonably priced.  My personal opinion is people are not yet aware  this book in the Star Wars Galaxy of Books has not come to earth yet.<br /><br />DO NOT PURCHASE THIS WONDERFUL WORK OF ART IF IT IS USED.  The detail of this book in all of its glory must be taken care of.  If you are thinking about seeing Matthew's wonderful work make sure you examine a sample copy, and before purchasing it open every page to make sure it is in perfect condition.  Above all keep it in plastic and take it out only for your enjoyment and the galaxy of friends you want to share it with.  This is the type of book that should only be handled by the owner.  DO NOT ALLOW ANYONE ELSE TO THUMB THROUGH THE PAGES.  This may seem crazy; however, I wear white lint free gloves when handling this masterpiece.  This book is easily three inches or more in thickness and if not handled with respect, the pop-up portions can easily be bent or worse.  Matthew Reinhart created a work of love, and as a consumer one should treat it as such.<br /><br />This book will disappear in two or three years.  Get it NOW at a price anyone can afford.<br /><br />I LOVE THIS BOOK MORE THAN ANY OTHER STAR WAR'S BOOK EVER PUBLISHED.  It truly is an amazing work for all to enjoy.<br /><br />Steve Horwitz
096798467X|5.0|This is a well written book, nicely illustrated and with a well thought out structure. It covers everything you should need to know on how to build an earth oven. The writing is clear and concise, while still conveying the obvious joy of someone who is genuinely inspired by their subject. I especially liked it because it contains a lot of technical detail illustrated with many examples and not much of the boring, preachy philosophical rambling that you find in so many books on hand building from natural materials. Not that there is anything wrong with philiosophising in its place, but I just wanted a book on how to build an earth oven and this is exactly what I got. I would also recommend, as a companion book, '[[ASIN:1890132055 The Bread Builders: Hearth Loaves and Masonry Ovens]]' which is a more general and comprehensive book on masonry stoves and baking of bread.
B000VLE3IS|4.0|I guess I should have known better. I already have all the studio albums (both vinyl and CD), both box sets, \\"The Song Remains The Same\\", and the Led Zeppelin DVD.  The only reason I bought this was because of the DVD that came with it, which I assumed had different live performances than previous releases.  Wrong!  It's nothing but highlights of the Led Zeppelin Live DVD.  Sorry, but theres no point in watching it.  I would rather watch the entire performance, just as I would rather listen to a studio album in its entirety rather than a \\"greatest hits\\" compilation.  Who out there, besides myself, feels that something is missing if \\"Heartbreaker\\" doesn't immediately kick into \\"Living Loving Maid\\"???    So why four stars?  Well, its still Zeppelin.  If you're a casual fan who only wants a \\"greatest hits\\" collection, it's a good buy.  Personally, I think \\"Out on the Tiles,\\" \\"The Rover\\", \\"Gallows Pole\\", \\"How Many More Times\\", and dozens upon dozens of other Zep songs are equally as good as the songs represented on this collection, so I really don't have any use for it.  Consider it like a sampler platter at a restaurant.  You're not getting any single \\"complete\\" meal, but that doesn't change the fact that its still delicious.    Yes, I will be getting the collectors edition of \\"Song Remains the Same\\", along with the CD.  At least I'll be getting \\"something\\" I haven't seen/heard before.    ...I think.
0143038419|1.0|I really wanted to like this book.  As someone who loves to travel internationally, I bought this book hoping she'd have first hand accounts and great stories of traveling to three such wonderful places as Italy, India and Indonesia.  Unfortunately I am over half way thru reading it and am struggling with every page.  This book is a whole lot of fluff.  It is painful for me to read.  The author is extremely self absorbed with her own issues which to me, seem completely pointless.  I don't see the point of this book,unless you are a whiny woman who wants to read about another whiny woman.
B000Y179KO|3.0|No Felder and no soulful leads. Lots of vocal harmonies..too much actually. Would have been better if they made the album shorter. Too many fillers. Songs with Timothy on vocals are good. This is something you would here from a Henley or a Frey solo album. But not the mighty Eagles.
B000Y179KO|5.0|The Eagles have produced an album that comes close to the genius of \\"Hotel California\\". While there are a few songs which have appeared elsewhere \\"Do Something\\" and \\"No more cloudy days\\", This is an album worth listening again and again. In fact, \\"Waiting in the Weeds\\", \\"Long Road out of Eden\\", and \\"It's your world now\\" are masterpieces. Don Henley's tight song writting, the awesome signature harmony of the guys, and the wicked guitar licks of Joe Walsh are in fine form. If you are an  Eagles fan or love real Rock music and not that crap that is played these days on MTV, DO NOT PASS THIS ALBUM UP!!!!!!!!!
1592332803|5.0|I made the ginger and banana muffins yesterday - the banana muffins did not get the chocolate - just the walnuts - and they were a GREAT GREAT success!  I have 'mini mini'  loaf muffin pan and a heart one so the batch was enough for the mini ones and the heart ones which came out so cute.  Before  they cooled down they were GONE!  I had to make 2 more batches, which made me almost late for work!  And today, everywhere I go people stop me and say, \\"These muffins were sooooo good....you must make them every day!....\\"  Havent tried anything else yet but will let you know!  Apart from the wonderful recipes the book is full of great information, tips and mouth watering photos!  A great gift to us all.  Thank you.
B000UNYJXQ|3.0|3.5 stars<br /><br />Moore really hasn't evolved much at all as a filmmaker since Columbine, and Sicko feels like just another Moore film, with all that implies, perhaps a little lighter on the cheese. What makes this film worthwhile are the facts, and the many mirrors he holds up to American prejudices, especially against \\"socialism\\", which he reminds us is inherent in libraries, police, roads, and government of almost all stripes, services that we all take for granted as part of \\"capitalism\\".<br /><br />Still, Moore can grind on the nerves at times with his cutesy cuts and obvious music choices, and he gets cheesy at various junctures with both editing and close-ups. He's a manipulator, as usual, but then again that's part of making a documentary, so perhaps his main failing is that he can be sloppy at it. He can also be quite good too, though, and let's face it: he got folks watching docs again, and has pissed off the moronic Our-God-or-Die \\"conservatives\\" to no end, so he's doing his job as an active American citizen.<br /><br />Above all, most of the points made in Sicko are worth considering. Personally, I work out and eat well and avoid doctors at all costs. If more folks took health into their own hands instead of going to the doctor for a new pill every week, the health care system would work a lot better. But what sane man would ever expect his government to fulfill this most basic human responsibility for him?<br /><br />And let's do what Moore suggests and be totally honest: if Moore himself wasn't such a bloated foodhog he'd be a much more convincing spokesman for health care. How can a man who clearly places no value whatsoever on taking care of his own health tell us all to pay his doctor bills for him? Moore is a bright guy and has made some good films, but his own ill health is a walking billboard for why universal health care will be a big mess in any country where taking care of your own health makes less sense than waiting for the government to do it for you.<br /><br />In fact, I'm willing to bet Moore himself is more than aware of this irony. He's too smart not to be, but clearly not smart enough to exercise the discipline in his own life that he demands here from Washington, D.C. (a place not exactly known for discipline of any sort).<br /><br />Talking the talk means a lot less coming from one who ain't walking the walk.o it for you.<br /><br />In fact, I'm willing to bet Moore himself is more than aware of this irony.

B000MR9D5E|1.0|Panoramic scenes of breathtaking beauty form the background of this remarkably dull yet amazingly cruel Series.    A true remake of Mondo Cane (1962), in this series, poor David Attenborough has the sad task of narrating the 'story' of each episode: inevitably about predators hunting other animals, eating them, killing weaklings and young.    The series is uninterested about the Planet Earth - you want to see more of it, but unfailingly the producers want to show you animals being eaten by predators, for they went to great trouble to film it and want you to see it.     Not how animals or birds live - but how they die.    Each kill is shown in sadistic detail, so that you can see the poor victim's last moments of pain and terror. You will soon see they or their chicks or cubs in their predators jaws still alive and then being dragged and killed - the camera will still linger long enough for you to see them eating their prey.    When you see an animal, any animal or bird - you already know that in a few moments time you will see their predators, time over time again this will be repeated.    In this series Animals are shown only this context: of killing and dying, for that is what interest the makers of this series , the killing of weak and young animals.     Nature is shown in short quick takes - monotonous text is reread by David Attenborough , for every episode is just a re-run of the previous one. They follow the same format. You saw one, you saw them all.     You wonder how the Producer of Blue Planet managed to create such a series.    Anything is better than this series.    Do yourself a favor and buy any of David Attenborough's great series, buy Blue Planet - head over shoulders better than this stupid disgusting series, a waste of your money and time.
0385486804|1.0|There isn't much of a story here.  A Pilgrim goes into the Wilderness totally unprepared and dies of starvation / food poisoning.  Not in the same league as \\"Shattered Air\\" by the same author.  The author has to really stretch the material to make 224 pages out of it.  I haven't seen the movie, but considering the known facts, it is likely to be mostly fiction.
B00005JLFC|5.0|I have been waiting over 2yrs for this movie to be on DVD. But no!!! this is more than a classic film this is an iconic film for me and i am sure a lot of people out there. seriously what is the hold up?!?!?!?!
B000VLE3IS|5.0|First of all i agree totally with previous posts regarding the sound quality, it's much better than anything previously released. Pro Tools has once again worked it magic. Black Dog looks phenomenal! If this is how the new Song Remains the Same video will look, i can't wait to get it. It pains me to watch the old one where jimmy's playing doesn't match the music and the camera shots make him look like comical. Finally we get to see what the band would have wanted the movie to look like. In addition Robert's voice is not dry like it is in the original release. As far as the cd's go, yes i have everything there but i guess you have to buy this to get the 1 or gems that you don't have. I personally don't care because i'm a true fan and would keep buying whatever jimmy can pull out of his vaults if it's this good.
1594489505|5.0|This heartbreaking tale of life for Muslim women in Afganistan of the last 30 years, gives great insight into the survival skills women had to possess to live through numerous governmental shifts, antiquated male-dominated views and the repression of extreme followers of Islam.  Amazing read, and wonderfully hopeful conclusion.
B00000D9TQ|5.0|I think Phil Collins tonality, his music and approach to music is unique, and of course nostalgic for me as well. In terms of his genre, I truly believe Phil Collins is a legend.
B000VLE3GA|5.0|I purchased this album based on the (positive) review that I read here, stating that the quality was top-notch. The quality is def. worth the money! I compared this album to my other Zep CD's, and you can tell a big difference. Don't complain about this...embrace it!
B000VAPZM2|5.0|My daughters are 8 yrs and 19 months. HS1 and HS2 are movies that I can sit down and enjoy with both of them.  The eldest loves watching the movies and the youngest likes dancing to the music.  Mom enjoys not only time with her girls, but a cute story too.

I listened to the audio version of the book and being a novice became a bit more knowledgeable about this ultra popular search engine with extraordinary features.

6304936362|1.0|I chuckled when I read a few reviews that described this movie as \\"accurate\\".  About the ONLY thing accurate about it is that they depicted the bombers as B-17F's which is the model of the Memphis Belle.  There were a few good flying scenes and some memorable scenes of the inside of a B-17; otherwise, the story has been altered by Hollywood for its own purposes.  They didn't use the real names of any of the Belle's crew (unforgivable IMO), and not even the Belle's nose art was correct (it was dolled up considerably from the real thing).  Anyone interested in the REAL Memphis Belle should see William Wyler's outstanding documentary, or read Belle pilot Bob Morgan's excellent book, \\"The Man Who Flew The Memphis Belle\\".  Then you would understand why I dislike this movie so much.
B000VLE3IS|4.0|I am personally a post-breakup Led Zeppelin fan. The only album I ever bought of theirs is the fourth, just like most casual fans I would imagine, given the notoriety of it (especially \\"Stairway To Heaven\\"). Mothership is an excellent next step for those who want to explore more of the band's repertoire. I would say it's a pretty good overview of their entire catalogue, plus a taste of what they were like in concert. Key words: overview, taste.    A clue that this is directed to the younger generation is the usage of the brilliant Shepard Fairey to design the package. He manages to make classic rock contemporary and relevant to today's kids. Minor complaints: the packaging feels cheap (my cover is already scuffed) and it's hard to remove the discs out of the pockets (they're likely to get scratched up).    For the longtime fans who likely have all the tracks in one form or another, this is only for completists who need to own every release, therefore I doubt you need to buy this. For new fans, I highly recommend this.
1592332803|5.0|If you are Vegan or Vegetarian you must get this book! Especially with the holidays coming up you can easily find a delicious treat to bake for your non-Vegan family and friends. You will prove anyone wrong that says Vegan food is bland or tastes funny with this cookbook. The recipes are with staple ingredients, easy to follow and don't have bizarre amounts of maple syrup like some other Vegan baking books. The pictures are beautiful and mouth watering. It also contains information on substitution of animal ingredients so that you can make your old recipes Vegan friendly. I absolutely love this book and highly recommend it. It is definitely the best book purchase I've made all year!
B00009UW0N|5.0|This film is truly one of the scariest films ever. When I first saw it I had chills. I walked out of the room because I was so scared. It has the perfect atmosphere and the perfect score. And it has a great script.
B00004RF8J|4.0|I have always enjoyed this film. Ellen Greene is the definitive Audrey, and Rick Moranis does a more than adequate job as Seymour, with a surprisingly good voice. My problem is with the ending. The movie, while mostly funny, is supposed to have a very dark ending, with a message of what can happen when you are too success-driven.    The original film, and of course the theatrical production, does have this dark ending, with the warning of \\"Don't Feed the Plants\\". Apparently, there was an alternative ending (that I believe you can find on youtube), which shows the plants basically taking over the world. Apparently, screenings were held which didn't go too well... people didn't like the dark ending. All the film has at the end is that little wink at the audience with the little plant smiling.    The entire scene of Seymour feeding Audrey to the plant (\\"at last I'll be Somewhere That's Green\\"), is missing, which is too bad. What is there is good, but it could have been so much better.
B0000026NC|3.0|This album is both good and bad. It is good because it Has alot of my favorite Floyd songs such as: \\"On the Turning Away\\", \\"Wish You Were Here\\", \\"Comfortably Numb\\", and \\"Time\\". It is bad because it is ruined by \\"The Dogs of War\\" and \\"Round and Around\\" two of the worst Pink Floyd songs i have ever heard. \\"One of These Days\\", \\"Yet Another Movie\\", and \\"Learning to Fly\\" are Ok but far from great. I have to say this though David Gilmour's vocals are alot Better than Roger Waters'.    I recommend Pulse on either CD or DVD. Much Better!
1596912855|5.0|Thank you, Shannon Hale, for a perfect rainy afternoon read!  The writing was clever, and witty, and reminded me of Austen's conversational tennis matches between characters.  Forget those \\"negative nelly\\" reviewers and get ready for a delightful read.  Go Colin Firth!
B0000067L3|5.0|cream's wheels of fire is their 2nd best album after disreali gears - only because it has more material to contend with being a double album.    the first side is studio output. everybody knows \\"white room\\" - its classic opening chords and wah-wah solo. next follows a reworking of howlin wolf's 'sitting on top of the world' gives clapton an excuse to cut loose some fiery blues soloing. 'passing the time' thought a substandard track has some nice soloing at the end. 'as you said' sounds like a nursery rhyme. ginger baker has his turn at the vocals with 'pressed rat ...'. then there's 'politician' with its catchy riff and overdubbed/overlayed solos. jack bruce is in fine vocal form here. cream sizzles on a slightly faster version of albert king's 'born under a bad sign'. 'deserted cities' has energetic acoustic rhythm and stinging soloing from clapton.    the live side opens with a fiery version of robert johnson's 'crossroads' with the immortal twin solos by clapton. but the highlight of this double album is without doubt the 20 odd minute version of willie dixon/howlin wolf's spoonful. this is imo the penultimate cream jam track. superlative soloing by clapton with fantastic bass play by the lord of the low frequencies - jack bruce. i've never heard anything like it ever. traintime is bruce showing his harmonica skills and toad has baker pounding the hides in a bit too long solo.    though it shines in parts, those parts do overwhelm. nobody else, even they themselves today, can repeat such a feat.
B000URDEB0|3.0|As primarily a Nightwish fan, and not a death-goth-prog metal onlooker, I would hope this review would get some recognition. This new album is instrumentally brilliant, as usual by Tuomas, and our vocal newcomer sometimes makes it work.     Tuomas has been paraphrased as choosing Annette over another carbon copy of Tarja, but the fact remains that the maturation of Tarja's classically trained voice made Nightwish stand out from the psuedo-operic, Pop-sounding carbon copies such as Epica, Sirenia, Ellis, so on and so forth.  This new sound album may certainly appeal to the new generation of opera and symphonic rock who are still stuck on \\"bubble-gum\\" girly agnst.     I recently took my wife to Nightwish in Dallas, TX, the Paladium. Excellent performance, and to tell you the truth, Annette sounded better than on the album, but then, that may because she did a number of past Nightwish covers, attempting the octive range of Tarja. Not bad, not bad, but without the control and emotional power of a woman; again, it came across as a bubblegum affair. A few time Annette attempted to cover up here inability to hold the surge, and screamed out the chorus line along with Marcos.     Marcos, on the other hand sounds better all the time. My wife, who was not particularly fond of Tarja (I think she's jealous ;)) agrees with my above synopsis; Tuomas find another mature classically trained voice. I think when you listen to this album's first CD (thank goodness T.H. included the 2nd), you will begin to wonder how much better it would sound with Tarja.     Hey, carbon copies do work... ACDC's front man is arguably better than Bon Scott, and is certainly considered as much a part of ACDC, or more, than Bon. I really am sorry about this Tuomas Holopainen, I was looking forward to many more years of Nightwish...... Still, Thank you guys for the energy and engagement in the performance last Sunday, 11/11/07!!!    Not Afraid Of Change,    Ivan Sheridan
B000VI70WM|1.0|YEOWCH.  Guess all good things come to an end, eh?<br /><br />Throw another failed hero's corpse on the pyre.  An appropriate name for the album and I think the victims are Simon, Nick and the (and now there were) two Taylors (wish Andy could play nice, they're at a loss without him, I mean, Warren Cookaburra, past his Zappa prime?!!?).<br /><br />Simon admitted this was their attempt to get back in the charts but what price victory?  This has all the earmarkings of late '00s production, sparse instruments, heavily processed percussion, and the overall feeling of a humid, sticky dancefloor in some urban setting, all achieved while working with Timbaland and an ex member of one of the many boy bands to follow in DD's wake in the two decades since the band was going up the charts and most of South America was going up their collective nose.  You could hear this in the clubs and not remember a single song.  I don't.<br /><br />At least the boys are being honest in their bid for something beyond the cabaret circuit Limahl and Human League work these days.  It's shallow and so were they, and Simon said in an Uncut interview (21 January 08.  It was actually SPIN.  Ed.)  they wanted to grow old disgracefully like the Stones.  Well Simmo, it's a start.  Get it out of your system, patch things up with Andy, and do another brilliant work like Astronaut.<br /><br />Signed,<br />epsteinsmutha
B000WCDI64|4.0|Not quite sure why no one's reviewed this item yet of everyone's favorite tabloid car-crash...It appears this DVD was taped in May of 2007 (had trouble verifying the date)...And it's interesting simply to watch Winehouse when she AND HER VOICE are actually in really good form.  She and her stellar band of course play all the songs off Back To Black, a couple 1st LP tracks, a couple B-side covers, along with a snippet of Lauryn Hill's Doo Wop (That Thing)...She's charming, random, self-deprecating and actually quite funny between songs--at times.  She's mostly loose and lucid as opposed to being drunk or too drugged up to perform...Sound quality and performance top notch...The documentary bonus (50 minutes) is nice but not too enlightening...Still worth a watch...Wish they'd had more in-the-studio footage, and that her performance was a little more varied...Only other criticism is of the few unnecessary times the camera would pan to her husband in the audience.  Oh well...Overall very, very good!
0525950079|4.0|After a month of reading I am finished! It was a great book (as usual by Ken Follett), though the story would've been just as good without the lesbian relationship and the sex/rape scenes in my opinion. Ken Follett has the knack for creating villains that compel you to read obsessively to see them get their due by the end of the story. This man's books have glue on them! I couldn't put this one down! WWE was a nice sequel to \\"Pillars\\" if you want to call it that. Both stand on their own and are well worth the price! Great Entertainment
B000VSBX34|1.0|I do enjoy the Beatles movies.  I also remember that outside influences made the audiences during the 60's enjoy the movies, maybe more than they deserved.    But there is a major problem with this product.  I think the transfer is remarkable on a visual level.  The sound has problems.  I wonder if the music sound producer for this release is the same person who didgitally remastered the LP'S back in the 90's or early 2000's.  There seeems to be a lack of bass and an over abundance of high end sound.  Did the music sound get remastered at a different studio from the movie dialog sound?  When Dialog is being spoken the sound is very good, when the songs start the frequencies are very different, making the sound out of balance with the spoken dialog.  And almost painful to listen.     I recommend purchasing the original DVD release just for the quality sound.  But if you really need explosive color, picture and sound get this one.  But remember to release the pressure in your ears before you start to carry on a conversation with people who have not watched the movie with you. They will thank you for not talking louder than needed.

B000HC2LI0|5.0|Anyone who is a fan of the West Wing already knows how wonderful the show is.  However, the added features offered on the DVDs make this series even more special.  You learn more about the characters and the actors themselves and you find out about the directors and producers and why they did scenes they way they did.  It is especially interesting to find out about the secret of CJ's fish bowl!!!!
0143038419|5.0|Liz Gilbert is a wonderful pop style writer. She's not afraid to share her neuroses and insights. As a seeker of inner peace and an alternative to the dogmatic protestantism with which I was brought up, I also study meditation, Buddhism and yoga and have been curious about Bali, so her experiences are insightful. However, I can't help but think how nice it was that she could follow her journey with enough money and time to be so independent. Her experiences therefore are rarified and elitist and not for us average Josephines.

B000QUCNP4|1.0|Dont buy this DVD. Not yet anyway. This is a lame bare bones edition rushed out too fast. There will be a special edition with Finchers Directors cut, commentaries and a full documentary on the case released later this year or early next. Great film but they will double dip ya so wait!
0060888695|2.0|I was really expecting the definintive reading of this fantastic classic but was disappointed in Sissy's reading.  It is stiff, slow, and a bit forced.  She reads like she's reading to a 2nd grader rather than reading about one, working too hard to be completely articulate.  It is worse at the beginning of chapters and loosens up some in the middle but is disappointing from such a fine actress.  If the Roses Pritchard version comes out on CDs, I'd rather have it.
B000001ESP|5.0|The first time I heard this album was 1981 and I was hooked instantly.  The sound was incredible.  This is one of the rare albums you can listen to over and over again.  The only drawback is that it spoiled me and I assumed that every album would be just as good (Rush's other albums are good but they aren't \\"Moving Pictures\\").
006054094X|4.0|Haven't really read the whole thing, but so far so good. Too bad it has no GOOD criticism, meaning that the truth of this book is limited to certain extent. However, there are amazon tribes that have \\"mongoloid\\" features and use wooden needles like acupuncture... Hmmm, coincidence or did the Chinese really came to America first?
B000VH3FV8|5.0|Perhaps I'm talking thru my hat, but all the other people who reviewed \\"Love, Luther\\" missed the point.  Everyone talks about what's missing, what should have been included instead, all the rare and unreleased stuff that could have been put on.  Then it dawns on you, if Sony had done what these people wanted, it would result in a 10-15 disc box that nobody would be able to afford.  The point is, Luther was a rarity in the music business: a truly gifted musician, singer and performer who could do it all, so Sony wanted to touch on as many points of that as they could within the confines of a 4-disc box set, and it succeeds beautifully.  It includes hits, early work from groups like Luther, Change and Bionic Boogie, live cuts, rarities, and even a cut written and produced for another artist (\\"Jump To It\\", the 12-inch version by Aretha).  All this is what I bought the box for.  Sony was obviously gambling that people who were not into Luther before would buy this, and it would whet their appetites for more, and they're right.  So the box doesn't serve \\"long-time fans\\" as well as it could have.  So what?  There's no arguing the sheer artistry of what's here, so even if you're a long-time fan, you'll buy it.  Those of us who were not \\"into\\" Luther before, will now become converts, unfortunately after the man has already passed on.  And I'm betting that that's where Sony was going when they put this box together.
B0001Z6440|5.0|Some beards are jarring, some persnickity details are off (Buford's men were better armed), and time doesn't permit representing every engagement, but this movie gets better with each additional watching and is well-crafted such that plausible drama is created.  Enjoyable reenactments, relatively good acting and even better writing.  Best civil war movie out there.  Louis J Sheehan
B000001EAQ|5.0|A friend of mine told me this was his favorite U2 album. I liked it, mostly, when I first heard it. I recently listened to it again after months of not touching it, and have rediscovered the incredible complexity of the art that makes up this album. As a result, I have fallen back in love with U2 in a new way. Beautiful in its obnoxiousness, shifting between the bawdiness of \\"MOFO\\" and the subtle beauty of \\"If you wear that velvet dress\\", this is a true gem.     Also, as a bass player myself, I have to appreciate the fact that this is by far Adam's best album. He is reborn in many ways with this release.
B000GT4H0Y|5.0|I loved this movie so much that i had to rent it twice, then bought it, now it's going on my ipod.     If you watch it from the very beginning, don't be high, and just pay attention, you'll love the movie if your into sci fi that is, if your not, you won't.    It's got a cool, futuristic lifestyle going on in the movie, I like that. Who knows where our future will bring us, I wonder about stuff like in this movie, if it's possible                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     that these things can happen one day.

0441172717|5.0|You have to read this book! When I purchased Dune I expected a good book. What I had was something unimagined! I got addicted to living in the world Frank Herbert created. I became emotionally attached to the characters. Actually I became depressed when I finished reading it.    Dune is about love and feud, treason and loyalty, fear and courage, politics and religion it's about life. Most surprisingly, in Dune you can see how myth is actually reality but viewed from the outside.    The world and the characters Frank Herbert created were just too real. Actually while reading this book you forget that this is all the imagination of Frank Herbert! The way that Frank Herbert writes, the style, the logic, the details are just surprising. Even if you are not a science fiction fan, read this book; just forget about the fictitious stuff and concentrate on what could be real, you will be amazed.     I did not read the sequels and I don't want to. I loved this book and I am afraid to ruin the feelings and memories I have for the characters and for the story by reading the others. However, Herbert has a message he wants to deliver in the rest of the series, but I think I am already aware of it as I read the genesis of Dune. I think each person will love this book in his own way. Extremely Recommended!

B000E33VWW|3.0|I made the mistake, as it were, of having first seen \\"[[ASIN:B000M341SC Infamous]]\\", which for some inadequately explored reason is a film about the exact same theme made only one year after Capote and its coveted statuettes. There is no doubt in my mind that had I seen Capote earlier, I would have enjoyed the way it brings a somewhat forgotten eccentric author to the fore of this generation's mind. I've devoured Capote's writings, and am especially a fan of his short stories -- there is no better or more succinct introduction to the American south, its lingo, its dailyness. He was quite the social butterfly and made no effort to hide it.<br /><br />That is why, as much as I am myself a vocal proponent of a relaxed sensitizing style of movie-making such as Bennett Miller's, I cannot help feeling that life of a man in the fast lane simply does not belong in a noirish glacial film such as this. It seems so punch-drunk on being important and creating atmosphere that it forgets to develop its characters. The last half hour or so is probably the most tedious reminder as we wait listlessly for extension after dull extension to the hanging of the 'cold blood'-ed murderer.<br /><br />For people truly interested in Capote, \\"Infamous\\" does a sharper and more eloquent job of infusing the kind of joie de vivre for which Truman Capote is known. Seymour Hoffman may have gotten the Oscar nods, but Toby Jones kicks b*tt -- pardon the expression given the context -- as the actual character; he even looks and lisps like him! The script is strewn with just the kind of jaunty wit that was his hallmark. But the biggest sucker punch of all comes from Daniel Craig, whose intensity is orders of magnitude more hard-hitting as the criminal who became the cynosure of Capote's famous last book \\"[[ASIN:0679745580 In Cold Blood]]\\".<br /><br />Taken on its own, I am sure \\"Capote\\" is quite a film, but \\"Infamous\\" towers over its award-winning predecessor in almost every department conceivable: pace, dialogue, acting. Its breadth of emotion is all the more staggering for the depth it achieves; it bares the soul of everyone involved. Go for the laughs and stay for the tears and come away with a sense of what is human and what is kind. Do not miss that fabulous film, and watch \\"Capote\\" afterward if you absolutely must., dialogue, acting.

0143036742|5.0|It didn't take too long for me to fall in love with this book.  Beautifully written, carefully sculpted, full of wit and charm, very hard to put down.  I have to limit myself to picking it up only when I'm tucked in for the night, otherwise I don't get anything accomplished during the day...just reading this wonderful book.  I have recommended it to everyone I know who enjoys a good story.

He brilliantly escapes with the help of a French cryptologist named Sophia.  Together they must solve the mystery.

0142403881|5.0|Charlie and The Chocolate Factory is about a young boy whose family is poor. The famous chocolate maker in town has a contest for a big prize. They have adventure in the chocolate factory.<br /> My favorite part of the book is when Charlie finds the last golden ticket. Once he finds it everyone chases him and he becomes an instant celebrity. Now that he got it he gets to go to the chocolate factory and maybe even win the bid prize. All these news reporters come and interview Charlie at his home. In a couple of days he gets to go to the factory and meet Willy Wonka.<br /> I'd recommended this book to anyone that wants to read a fun easy read. This book tells you that no matter how much money you have or your living style you can still succeed. This is a good book for any age of people. This book helps you think about the positives and not to be greedy. If you're good then good things will happen.
B00005JA2B|5.0|First of all Kansas did not produce a bad album during their 70s career, however one thing is for certain they never sounded quite like this before or after recording this masterpiece. Clearly this jewel contains the best of what they do, and while Masque hints at what was coming this is the real deal. Interestingly I purchased this used thinking I was getting the remastered version, and ended up getting the original release, which sounds fantastic, infact I have just received the other Kansas Cds in the remastered series, and none approaches the sound of this standard version. Go Figure!
0316166685|5.0|Lovely bones is about this girl who is raped and chopped into pieces. Her dad and sister try to find out who killed her and in the process her family is destroyed.<br />  When she dies it gives us flash backs about her life before. She wasn't a goodie goodie like every one thought she was. She was a real person who made mistakes and did things her parents didn't want her to do. One flash back she skipped class to go make out with a guy and almost got caught.<br />  I recommend this book because its a great mystery and it explains what happens to a family and to the community when someone is murdered and raped. This book is a little different because it was written from a view of a dead teen. It makes you feel like anything can happen to anyone at any time and it's scary. \\"Listen to your feelings\\".  Parents always say that when they give those weird rules. In this story, she should have. She was uncomfortable and she should have gotten out when she could.
0399211667|5.0|My two-year-old enjoys reading this book.  While the book is repetitive, it enables a toddler to \\"read\\" along with you and complete the sentences.  The book is replete with farm animals, a common feature in children's books, and the web that the spider is building is raised, so children can trace it with their fingers.
0812550706|5.0|Enders game is about a kid that is  enrolled into a battle school where they play games that make them better soldiers. As Ender is at the battle school he kills wolves, other kids and a giant. My favorite part of the book is when Ender kills the giant. I love it when he hops in the giant's eye and scoops the giants eye out. Then he does the same thing to the other eye. I recommend this to people who like sci-fi books or adventure books. It is a very good read that has many up and downs. You will not want to stop reading until you reach the last chapter. This book has a very good plot. This book  is one of few books I enjoyed reading and I hope you will like it to.

After a near death situation that left Joe with a broken leg they now must work together to climb down the mountain safely, until about halfway down another disaster strikes which separates the two friends.<br />  Could you imagine crawling down a mountain, with a broken leg, all alone? You try to turn on your headlamp but the light just flickers and instantly goes out as you try to make your way through the pitch black night. You feel lost and ready to give up when that voice comes in your head that won't let you quit and tells you to keep going.  Joe never gives up as he hangs on to his last chance of hope....and finally he is rewarded.<br />  I would definitely recommend this book as it kept me interested the whole time. This book shows perseverance and the will to survive, which keeps you in suspense and makes you want to keep reading. It shows that you should hang on to every last chance you might have, as the unthinkable can happen. I admire the characters in this book as I remember how they never gave up and kept fighting, I now think of them when I am about to give up something. Overall, this book is exciting and will give you a better understanding of what it means to persevere and never give up.<br /><br />  Jake J
B000TJBNFI|4.0|You all know what the movie is about, so I won't rehash it here.  This film has been released on DVD before, but that was back when MGM owned themselves and put out poor DVD product.  Now (circa 2007) that Fox owns MGM, they are re-releasing a number of MGM titles in much better quality.  This is a prime example.  MGM had released this important film in letterboxed only format - no 16:9 anamorphic enhancement for widescreen TVs.  No bonuses either.  Fox has now delivered a superb 16:9 transfer that totally blows away the older disc.  The bonuses are plenty, entertaining, and informative.  The packaging is nice too, and looks like a hardcover book.  It is easy to recommend purchasing this disc by Fox.  I own a Blu-ray player, but DVD is still my main squeeze.  And with quality like this, why not?

In the end though it made him one of the strongest people in the world, a Navy S.E.A.L.<br />  Lone Survivor is one of the best books I've read. It is so realistic because its a true story. The other goes into deatail somuch that this book will havew you hanging on thedge of your seat. Although it starts off slow it is so action packed that you will never want to put it down. I beleave that this book should be read by everyone, to understand what our soldiers are going through. I would also recomend this book to anyone who likes to read about the Iraq war.
1582701709|4.0|--- First of all, sorry about my english, I'm ecuadorian ;) But I promise you that you'll find some interesting thoughts in my review ---<br /><br />This book is great, in fact I've been using 'the power' of the Law of Attraction for a long time and IT WORKS 100% of the time... I mean it... but...<br /><br />The problem with ALL THESE AUTHORS is only one, they encourage people to question their beliefs, they encourage everyone to believe what they want to believe, what makes us feel good... but the BIG problem that seems nobody has noticed is that they teach that we must almost IGNORE everything else that isn't agree with what they are teaching. Then, where is the freedom to choose our own beliefs? It 'looks like' they try to take everything else out of the scene and only let us with THEIR beliefs? doesn't it?<br /><br />And if we are smarter, why not wonder about who came with these teachings first? Because everyone talks about it with great confidence and autority, but why do we have to do it their way? Ok, Napoleon Hill talked about that, Carnegie talked about that... so what??? If you track the law of gravity you could go back to Newton... and??? The law of gravity and the law of attraction exist since the begining of time, but who gave the autority to all of these authors (that I like and respect a lot) to teach what they teach, the way they teach it... ask yourself, why are they the only ones that have the reason (even when we know now that the law of gravity isn't exact as Newton said it was) can't they be wrong? Who taught the rules of the law of attraction to the first of us, so he/she can claim he/she knows THE truth? The Universe??? (please... don't believe everything you hear) Can anyone really believe (when he/she isn't hypnotized by these so delicious beliefs) that the universe thinks, or everything works by human thoughts? C'mon... what about the planets, comets, galaxys that crashes every day, who was the stupid that made that happen, who is the responsable about the constant extreme heat in Mercury...? when look at any star in the sky it's the image of something that happened millions of years in the past, we only see the light that that star produced, and that light has travelled millions of years to reach the planet earth, so, who was the human that 'create' that star millions of years ago??? The universe did it??? By itself??? Do you really think that... if so, why do you believe in it? Because someone else teaches that... why is he/she correct?<br /><br />The way that absolutely everyone is teaching does not leave opportunity for anyone to say anything different, and the universe (^_^) can't say anything to correct the 'teachers'. Why? Because the teachers are right??? NOOO, it's just beacuse the universe can't think or speak... this sounds very funny to me :)<br /><br />That's enough... as I said I do believe in the L.O.A. I only encourage you to think... just THINK. I love all these authors, I buy their books and everthing... I have spent a small fortune in these knowledge.<br /><br />I believe and apply the teachings of the law of attraction, and (to me) everyting you need to know and some things you just don't need as well (that's the reason 'cause I give it only 4* stars), ARE in this book. It's interesting to read other books, but in my opinion this book could easily be all you need.<br /><br />1) Know what you want.<br />2) Truly believe that you'll have it, be clear and very specific about it, and start to FEEL with all your senses that you already have it.<br />* Don't let anything (thoughts, beliefs or memories) or anybody (people, doctors, teachers, economists, negative news at the tv or in newspapers, etc.) make you doubt about you'll recieve exactly what you want.<br />3) Recieve it and be thankful.<br /><br />To me that's all you need, that's how I get everything I want, the way I want it, by the time I want it... 100% of the time.<br /><br />I hope my comment can be useful to you. And yes, Irecommend you to buy this book.

B000MM1F5A|4.0|HER VOICE IS WARM, PATIONATE. SHE CAN MAKE YOUR SENSES FEEL ALIVE. THE CD IS FANTASTIC.
B000MRAAJW|5.0|If you have seen parts of the documentary, and you like them you should buy this. I was'nt disapointed.
B000K7VHQ4|4.0|One of the nice things about a strong cast is that they can hold your attention even after you've realized what's coming.  \\"The Illusionist\\" is a film saved by it's cast, all of whom are excellent.  The story's resolution becomes obvious almost as soon as the conflict is established, however.  Nevertheless, the acting and imagery created by the scenery and special effects creates a compelling vision of the fairly straightforward storyline.  Good musical score, too.  I recommend it as a date flick, although it is a little dark and quasi-spiritual (not a 1st date flick).  Not an outstanding movie, yet worth an evening or slow afternoon, especially as an alternative to romantic comedies or some other type of relationship movie.
B000WM725C|5.0|this is a must for any neil young nut, like me. i agree with what all the others have posted,
B00000IREA|5.0|Okay, Jane Fonda has that Viet Nam thingy going against her - but to err is human!  Fortunately for us all, Barbarella isn't one of Fonda's mistakes.      Granted, males would certainly enjoy this film more than females, still being an artistically inclined female, I certainly appreciated the styles, the settings, and was fairly amused at some to the humorous situations.      This is a nice movie to unwind with as it was written and delivered in a \\"we're not taking ourselves too seriously\\" style.      The colors, the imagination, the sheer beauty of some of the scenes makes this a worthwhile way to unwind or even to prepare for bed - for who knows what wonderful dreams it may trigger?  (Warning: If you're married, this film might inspire you to play out a few of your own fantasies???)      As you might expect, yes, this is a classic piece of fluff that I would highly recommend.
B000M5AJQI|1.0|i was comparing the picture quality of this blu-ray dvd to the hbo hd broadcast and i was shocked to find that the dvd is not in true cinemascope as advertised...but a regular full screen ratio CROPPED AT THE TOP AND BOTTOM OF THE SCREEN to give it the APPEARANCE of cinemascope. so not only is it lacking the width of the original in theater version...but cropping off the top and bottom of the picture. what a rip off! i intend to return this product.
B000YMBBH0|5.0|The Bourne Trilogy is one of the greater trilogies that has been released. Each movie just as intense as the last, these movies fail to disappoint.  If you're a fan of any of these movies, then the trilogy is a must have. Also, there won't be a boxed set released in HD DVD any time soon, so this is a great deal!
B000069HKH|5.0|I absolutely love this CD, I've been listening to it for 5 years now, and still have tears running down my face when certain songs are on.  He captured the raw emotion I felt on 9/11, and it still to this day can capture me.  Now that's fantastic music.
B000VI70WM|3.0|What a shame.  This had the potential to be the best Duran Duran CD in years.  The problem is the Timber/Justin involvement.  What was the band thinking? Some great song writing but horrible mixes.  Hopefully the CD crashes and we get the real Duran Duran back.
0767802551|5.0|DONNIE BRASCO is an excellent film in every way.  The justly Oscar-nominated screenplay is complexly layered.  The performances are all of the highest calibre.  Pacino should have received a Best Actor Oscar nomination for his performance as Lefty and Anne Heche deserved a nod in the Supporting Actress performance as Donnie's put upon wife.  This was Depp's first great performance as well. His Donnie has to be able to operate on three levels simultaneously - allowing the audience to perceive wordlessly what he is thinking and feeling, while not betraying any of this to the underworld characters he is interacting with - a subtle and galvanized performance.    At first with a moustache and sporting a Brooklyn accent, Depp as Donnie is an FBI agent infiltrating a NY mob.  His protector is a two-bit gangster, Lefty, disillusioned that he has nothing to show for a life time of service. He is also disappointed in his drug-addicted son.  Donnie gives him a chance to believe in something and becomes his surrogate son. Donnie in turn gives Lefty the respect and schemes for wealth that have been absent from his life.  These two bond in ways that go beyond the FBI's predictions of what the sting should look like.    Donnie becomes enmeshed with Lefty, slowly becoming a \\"wise guy\\" himself, disillusioned at the lack of respect and reward he as an FBI agent is receiving.  As the sting gets closer, Donnie is torn between doing his job and saving his new friend, Lefty.    It is an emotional film and one very taut and tense.  There are moments when we are sure Donnie is going to be exposed and we cringe.  The whole thing is superbly directed by Mike Newell, who manges to extract amazing nuances from a script that Scorcese would have trampled over.  (Indeed Scorcese's THE DEPARTED is simply a reworking of the DONNIE BRASCO script with two infiltrators rather than one.)    The mob is ugly- we are taken inside their world and see them for what they are - macho, ugly, brutal, ignorant,uneducated, evil pieces of scum - disgusting and revolting dregs of humanity.  Newell pulls no punches here - be warned. We are shown in minute detail the steps whereby a novice gets into the undeworld and how he moves up, step by step - as well as the \\"language\\" of the streets.    There is an excellent and unobstrusive dramatic score.  Paul Giammatti (sp?) appears in two small scenes, one as the inquistor we've been waiting for, asking \\"So, what does 'Forget about it!' really mean?\\"    To sum up: This is an excellent film about ugly people with a superb script, fine direction and top notch performances.  One of the best and Depp's first step up the ladder to his position today as America's best screen actor.
B000OVLBGC|5.0|I give this a 5 star rating. It is seldom one sees a truly memorable film of this high a caliber. It is first rate - finely written and superbly acted - tense, sexy, political, and touching. It is one you will remember for a long time afterward.
B000JJRIN4|3.0|I think some of these artists are trying sooo hard to do something different that it ends up sounding like sh**.    The tracks 'Breakin' Up' and 'Orange County Girl'    What in holy hell was Gwen thinking with those 2 songs?? Why would she even put that horrible garbage on her album? I didn't buy the cd( glad I didn't), but I've heard the album and only a few songs stood out, some other songs just make you go WTF?
0316287059|5.0|I am an aspiring MUA and I must say this book is fabulous. Whether you are a professional or just the everyday gal who loves to look great, this book is for you. Granted there are some things in here that are more advanced but it is still a great book. Kevyn is fab a describing the most difficult techniques. I truly have learned so much from both of his books I have purchased.
B000O75F7C|4.0|Bleak stuff, to be sure, but the subject of techno-sensory overload has long been a Steve Wilson theme. A fan since 'Signify', I've often wished their aggressive moments weren't so few and far between; the metal infusion suits me fine. My only criticism is that the last two cuts seem \\"tacked on\\" and the big choruses, by that point, a tad predictable. I withhold one star solely because I set the bar impossibly high for these guys.
0316286850|4.0|I loved this book. I love the amazing abilities make-up has to transform people. Kevyn is a master at this art. This book is definitely more advanced and more for your enjoyment and to be wowed!!! As a professional MUA this book could be a great learning tool but a little more over the top for the everyday person wanting to learn makeup tips.

B00005JNX0|3.0|Zoo animals forced to survive in the wild.  Sounds good.  Some funny parts but overly-sensitive overtones.  I guess it was kind of fun in parts but the moral of the story ruined it for me.
B000VKJ6VS|5.0|This second release by Alter Bridge definitely reveals the heart and soul of this band. The Zeppelin influence brings back the roots of true rock but Tremonti has a talent all his own that is indisputable in the is album. Myles Kennedy has a range that is amazing. I especially like the title track which I continue to replay as loud as I can while I'm driving down the highway. Can't wait til they stop by Atlanta.
1400064287|5.0|Wow!  Now I get it!  Now I understand why the corporate world (in general) and information technology realm (in particular) are so ... hmmm ... challenged.<br /><br />We struggle with ever-increasing complexity.  We polarize into groups and teams that specialize in [this], or become experts in [that.]  Communication breaks down, efficiency and productivity plummet, morale drops and chaos reigns.<br /><br />Sound familiar?<br /><br />By reading \\"Made to Stick,\\" I learned why communicating ideas and concepts to other people is not as easy as we intuitively think it is.  More often than we probably care to admit --- we talk, people hear, but our message doesn't resonate --- we ultimately fail to reach our intended goal to persuade, inform or entertain those around us.  Our ideas and messages go in one ear and out the other.<br /><br />How many times have you made an important point to a business client, or rushed through something with a co-worker that you thought was intuitively obvious, and walked away thinking \\"Hmmm, I don't think s/he got it?\\" or \\"Why is this problem so difficult to resolve?\\"<br /><br />We sometimes forget, or have never been taught, that people don't always remember everything they hear, see or read.  Only a small percentage of \\"content\\" actually gets through all the filters and barriers that our brains use on a daily basis to protect us from the sensory-overloading world that we live in.<br /><br />\\"Made to Stick\\" will teach you how to recognize those message-squashing, idea-blocking impediments to effective communication.  And guess what?  It will do so in a way that is easy and dare-I-say fun to read.<br /><br />Getting your thoughts and ideas to \\"stick\\" in someone's brain (aka \\"guessing machine\\") requires that we unlock many of the mysteries concerning how and why that wrinkly organ between our ears works.  Without giving away the punch line, the authors of Made to Stick provide the keys to unlocking much of that puzzle, offering a powerful yet simple framework for making your ideas sticky, or spotting the elements that make some ideas more effective than others.<br /><br />Just for fun, here are some of my favorite quotes from the book:<br /><br />\\"Becoming an expert in something means that we become more and more fascinated by nuance and complexity.\\"<br /><br />\\"Common sense is the enemy of sticky messages.\\"<br /><br />\\"Abstraction is the luxury of the expert.  If you've got to teach an idea to a room full of people, and you aren't certain what they know, concreteness is the only safe language.\\"<br /><br />\\"And that's the great thing about the world of ideas --- any of us, with the right insight and the right message, can make an idea stick.\\"ting the elements that make some ideas more effective than others.    Just for fun, here are some of my favorite quotes from the book:    \\"Becoming an expert in something means that we become more and more fascinated by nuance and complexity.\\"    \\"Common sense is the enemy of sticky messages.\\"    \\"Abstraction is the luxury of the expert.

B000SUKPKM|5.0|this is not all ther best i mean they left off NAKED,LONG WAY DOWN,WE ARE THE NORMAL,and a few others from ther earlier days but a pretty impressive  collection of hits from the goo.
B000E1MTYU|1.0|We were sent a replacement DVD for the original one was returned as \\"unplayable\\" in all of our DVD players including our Playstation 3. It was shocking to find out that the NEW one sent to us is also non-playable. We will be returning it too.
B000EGEVZK|5.0|For all those who've worn out the grooves in their It's Alive vinyl and have always wished they could SEE the concert as well as hear it - here it is! Not only do you get to finally see that historic footage but also decades worth of other gigs and clips as well.  I didn't think there could be another Ramones release that could possibly offer me anything new but this one does.  If you call yourself a fan you must own this.
B0008JIJ2E|5.0|I admit I really love this movie.  When I was in middle or high school, my mother insisted that I watch this movie because I was bullied at one time and I learned like Daniel to stand up for myself with some confidence and coordination.  also, I learned how to make friends because at one time, I had a problem making friends, too.
B000VKW7AK|5.0|I am not into buying sets that includes the same songs I already have in my collection...but this Box Set is AWESOME!!  The Box Set includes a concert with the Rust in Peace lineup.  The music selection is great and the live songs are not the same as always.  There are great remastered songs also.  This set is really a good compilation for anyone who is just starting to listen to Megadeth or a metal fan.      Listening to old songs but remastered is another experiece. There is only two short interviews...just a couple of mins each, so they really focused in bringin back good songs.      WORTH EVERY PENNY!
0553260111|5.0|This novel is so much better than the movie! I understand that the movie was supposed to be an updated, more modern version of the book, but I felt like the movie omitted very important details that were in the book. Also, I feel as though the action in the book is better than the action in the movie! I have to admit I was disappointed that the movie does not do the book justice. I seriously suggest reading the novel prior to seeing the movie (if you haven't already seen it!). I can't wait to read the other two books in this trilogy!
B000J6I0U2|4.0|My girlfriend and I enjoyed this movie very much.  I would classify it as a romantic comedy \\"chick flick\\" that guys would also find entertaining.  The period buildings, colors, and clothing really \\"pop\\", thanks to the high definition transfer.<br /><br />Heath Ledger (Casanova) has some hilarious one-liners in this movie.  My favorite was when a woman in a book store  tells him, \\"Casanova, I left my window open!\\"<br /><br />Casanova responds, \\"Darling, so many windows.... so little time.\\"<br /><br />The transfer to Blu-ray appears to be very well done.  I am glad I purchased this title.
B000VS6P9Q|5.0|There are a few multi-artist Dylan comps on the market, notably [[ASIN:B00005BGGV A Nod to Bob: An Artists' Tribute to Bob Dylan on His Sixtieth Birthday]] and the decent 30th anniversary concert soundtrack, the latter recorded long before his late 90's artistic revival when his new recordings again became as indispensable as his 60's and 70's output. Then there's compilations by individual artists like the Byrds, the Hollies, Richie Havens, Joan Baez, the Dead, and recently Brian Ferry, which aren't always spectacular either. Joan Baez, in my mind, is the greatest interpreter of Dylan's work; she can make each song her own like no one else.    Baez doesn't appear on this album, and neither do the remaining members of the Band. Perhaps they've developed and have been developed to such an extent by Dylan that an interpretation by either would be almost worthless. It's far more interesting to see an artist with an entirely different style, like Sonic Youth, Steve Malkmus or Cat Power, come along and modernize an old Dylan song.     Cat Power covered Dylan on her first Cover's Album, but her version of 'Stuck Inside a Mobile..' is not only recognizable, but up-tempo and very non-Cat-Power-like (almost happy). Former Pavement front-man Steve Malkmus has three songs on the album, as do Calexico. Both sets of contributions are outstanding; Steve Malkmus channels Dylan's vocals without leaving his own Lou Reed-influenced delivery far behind and Calexico may be an ideal backing band for Dylan himself if he didn't work so much in country and rockabilly; instead they play behind Willie Nelson, Roger McGuinn, Iron & Wine, and Jim James (of My Morning Jacket). Sonic Youth's cover of the title track, an obscure song, presumably off the basement tapes, with the original included at the very end of the second disc, sets the tone of the album along with a pretty good Eddie Vedder take of (the Jimi Hendrix interpretation of) All Along the Watchtower.     Other surprises include Yo La Tengo's profoundly gorgeous take of the early gem, Fourth Time Around, the Hold Steady's cover (not that great, but entertaining) of the early B-side \\"Can You Please Crawl Out My Window?\\", Jeff Tweedy's passionate delivery on Simple Twist of Fate, and perhaps the most profoundly moving cover on the album was done by an actor in the movie, a young african-american kid named Marcus Carl Franklin, one of the several actors who portray Dylan.     There aren't any big disappointments. Tom Verlaine's (of Television) cover of Cold Irons Bound comes to mind as one that could have been reworked a little so that it wouldn't drag as much. I skipped past Jack Johnson on my last couple listens, so I can't say much about that. Antony (of Antony & the Johnson's) sing Knockin on Heaven's Door just as you'd expect, but without adding much to note.     After all that, there's still a lot of artist contributions to comment on, but the nicest thing about the collection is that it doesn't sound like a bunch of disparate recordings patched together on one album. The arbitrary differences in production on most movie soundtracks and collections can cause them to fall apart if not well-sequenced. These songs all sound like they were recorded in the same studio under the same conditions, and the result is largely a sense of cohesion and purpose that's lacking on most tribute albums (even including Dylan's own tribute to Jimmy Rogers).     So, if you're going to get one collection of Dylan covers, this would be it. Now I can't wait to see the movie...
B00005JPS9|4.0|Like the beating bass that runs throughout the musical score of Robert Zemekis' adaptation of Beowulf, the computer animated epic will get your blood pumping. While not a flawless film, Beowulf has accomplished something great. Not only has Zemekis proved that animation can transcend audiences, assaulting viewers with its fiery adult content, but with Beowulf he proves that there are still new discoveries to be found in filmmaking.<br /><br />Adapted from the Seventh century epic poem, Beowulf (Ray Winstone) tells the story of a legendary Viking hero who arrives on Danish shores to purge the kingdom of a horrid monster, Grendel (Crispin Glover). However Grendel is far from the darkest creature plaguing the countryside, and Beowulf soon encounters a being far more manipulative, promising through its treacherous evil hedonistic pleasures of lust, riches, strength and power. Like King Hagarth before him, Beowulf's greed plunges the kingdom into misery and darkness, forcing the unrelenting warrior to atone for his sins in order to protect what he holds true in his heart.<br /><br />The challenge facing screenwriters Neil Gaiman and Roger Avery seemed monumental. Translating the dense, highly symbolic tale into mainstream, popcorn entertainment will most likely cause 7th grade English teachers to cringe, but with their tight adaptation and Zemeckis' brilliant vision, Beowulf comes to life in a way that not only anyone can enjoy, but will leave audiences absolutely astounded.<br /><br />Structurally the film doesn't flow as smoothly as other modern epics, like Peter Jackson's Lord of the Rings trilogy; in fact the film's opening is rather jerky. It isn't until the first appearance of the title character that the narrative begins to settle, after which point the picture becomes as grand as the legend it was based on.<br /><br />While the performances are solid, especially Ray Winstone's captivating presence as Beowulf, one can't help but feel there was something lost in translation after the layer of computer animation was applied to the actors. While Zemeckis has honed his technology, correcting many of the mistakes found in Polar Express, there is one thing the motion capture process has still not been able to capture, and that is the emotive presence of an actor's eyes.<br /><br />While a stage performance requires projection of emotion, film is far more capable of capturing the subtleties of human expression. However it seems that each character in Beowulf possesses no life behind their brilliantly illustrated eyes, seeming more like something out of Madame Tussaud's Wax Museum than living, breathing characters.<br /><br />However, the real heart of Beowulf doesn't get its pulse from its otherwise fine animation, but rather the brilliant and imaginative use of the third dimension. Like the mythical warrior, audiences should fight their way to see this film in digital, 3D projection. Being the first film to truly be designed from the ground up to take advantage of new 3D technology, Beowulf will leave audiences floored. This is not your parent's 3D; this is something wholly new, and seeing a seasoned filmmaker like Zemeckis take advantage of the extra dimension is a joy for anyone who has ever found pleasure in going to the movies.<br /><br />A visual masterpiece that will tantalize audiences with its stunning presentation, Beowulf makes up for its narrative flaws by creating an experience the moviegoer has never seen before. If Beowulf accomplishes nothing else, it will inevitably spark the imaginations of filmmakers both young and old, opening an avenue for an exciting new chapter in cinematic history.<br /><br />- Joe Russo, [...]mputer animation was applied to the actors.

B00003CX9Q|3.0|This review was originally written by my husband, Daniel Aeschliman, who has given me permission to repost it:<br /><br />As a child of the '80s, I must begin by stating that E.T. is, in my opinion, one of the truly great movies that has been released in my lifetime. When I began acquiring DVD's, I was truly saddened to find that E.T. was not available. After Steven Spielberg reissued the movie to theaters in early 2002, I eagerly awaited the impending DVD release.<br /><br />The Ultimate Gift Set version has some rather important differences to the regular two DVD version. First off, the set contains three DVDs - one for each of the released versions of the film and one for the bonus features. Additionally, it contains a CD of the score, composed by John Williams; a senitype (a fragment of film from a print of the movie in a cardboard frame - it contains an enlarged print of the image from the film strip on the top of the cardstock, and the back is numbered) of an image from the film; a \\"certificate of authenticity\\"; and finally a 200 page hardbound book \\"E.T. The Extra-Terrestrial: From Concept To Classic,\\" which contains a reproduction of the script for the 2002 reissue of the movie, in addition to interview bits with cast and crew members, and numerous stills from the movie and behind the scenes photographs.<br /><br />I will admit that I have yet to sit down and watch the 2002 edition of the movie. While a part of me would like to see it, there is still a part of me that wonders why I should watch it. The 1982 original version was a classic and is so firmly a part of me, that I don't really want to tamper with my memories of it. However, as I did view the redone versions of the Star Wars trilogy (and, ultimately, enjoyed the remakes over the originals with only slight reservations), I will likely sit down and watch the redone E.T. at some point - just not in time to do this review.<br /><br />The biggest disappointment with the DVDs in this set was the amount of repetition in the documentaries about the film. The problem seems to be that there isn't a real delineation of what material will be covered in each documentary. It could have been one specifically on how E.T. came to be a film, one about the making of the film, one about the special effects, one on the release of the film and its impact, one on the 2002 release, and so on. Instead, many of the documentaries overlap each other to such a large extent that you feel you're watching the same material over and over. The worst offenders of this were the roughly forty minute long \\"A Look Back\\" documentary (on disc two) and the fifty minute long \\"Evolution & Creation of E.T.\\" documentary (on disc three). With these two documentaries mirroring each other quite frequently, it becomes difficult to distinguish what material was seen in either one.<br /><br />More disturbing than this, though, is the \\"special announcements\\" section of disc three. After two serious promotional clips (one from the early '80s about the Special Olympics, with an appearance by E.T., the other a more recent clip about adoption), Universal chose to throw in a lengthy promotional piece about their theme parks. It feels completely inappropriate to be marketing their theme parks on the heels of the public service announcements, and calling the section \\"special announcements.\\"<br /><br />The soundtrack CD seems to be the same as the individually sold 20th anniversary edition remastered soundtrack CD, though it does not come in a jewelbox. The four discs (three DVD and one CD) are packaged together in a DVD box sized fold-out digipack style case, which has four panels with trays for the discs. The booklet that accompanies the CD was simply loose in the box and there is no booklet or even chapter cue sheet to accompany the DVD.<br /><br />The true jewel of this edition, however, is the book that was packaged with it. In the course of the 192 pages, a vast amount of material is presented. The book is divided into three main sections: the first details the story of how the E.T. story was created and the characters were cast, the second is an annotated script recreated from the 2002 edition of the movie, and lastly a section that details the special effects work done in post production of the 1982 edition of the film, and the work done for the 2002 edition.<br /><br />Most of the material in the first and third sections are presented in a series of quotes. A topic will be presented, such as \\"The Script: Writing The First Draft\\" and this heading will be followed by two or three quotes (sometimes more, sometimes less) from people involved in that aspect of the production.<br /><br />The second section provides the bulk of the book. This is where the script is recreated. It's hard to say that this is the original script of the movie, as there are some spots where this clearly is not the original script. For example, as the kids are getting ready to go trick-or-treating on Halloween, the script contains the \\"You are not going as a hippie!\\" line instead of the original \\"You are not going as a terrorist!\\" line. Additionally, some of the scenes that were cut from the movie originally (the bathroom scene and the extension of the halloween sequence) have been included in the script presented here, but other deleted scenes (such as Elliot drawing on the walls in the nurses office and Elliot in the principal's office) are left out. Other spots in the script have more inexplicable omissions - likely due to printing errors or something similar (for example, when Elliot is faking his fever, Mary checks the thermometer, asks Elliot a question, then responds to his answer, but the script contains no indication that Elliot has given any response to Mary's question).<br /><br />In the end, the original version of E.T. still stands up well (my five year old daughter watched it with me, and was reduced to tears when E.T. died, but was just as ecstatic as Elliot and Michael when they realized he was still alive), and the movie itself is what is ultimately important. My vote is still out as to whether the rest of the package was worth the hype of the ultimate gift set label (it appears that not only did Universal back down on their original stance of only putting the 1982 version of the film in the Gift Set, but the book is also available for sale separately, making the only \\"exclusives\\" to the set the senitype and the certificate of authenticity). The documentaries are generally worth watching, though a bit repetitive. Ultimately, while the Ultimate Gift Set may not truly live up to its name, it is a respectable presentation for a truly classic movie.of how the E.T. story was created and the characters were cast, the second is an annotated script recreated from the 2002 edition of the movie, and lastly a section that details the special effects work done in post production of the 1982 edition of the film, and the work done for the 2002 edition.

B000Y179KO|5.0|The anticipation I had while awaiting this large new collection of work, was completely worth the wait! Immediately, with the onset of the first song those familiar harmonies hit you and you find yourself seduced by your old friend. But since it is all new material it feels like the first time of course.<br /><br />I could not pause the playback, I let both discs play all the way through and as I progressed, it got richer, better, stronger. It was completely fulfilling, the sounds have all those variable genres that the Eagles have always been able to pull off. There was the rock sound, that pensive 'losing love' sound, the lone cowboy sound and even a couple (especially the one the album shares its name with) that are absolutely epic in nature.<br /><br />The lyrics also have a full range of body, from light to moving and from political to poetic. They are written with an artful skill while being completely up to date with current events. If you are a fan, you will not be disappointed, this Eagles album gives you everything they have always promised you, if you are new to the Eagles this album is just as good a place to start as any of the Eagles other satisfying compilations. I'm so glad some things never change.
B00003CX8Y|4.0|Beauty and the Beast (Platinum Edition) is a two disc set; the first disc contains several versions of the film and some bonus features, while the second disc is comprised entirely of bonus features.<br /><br />The menu for the first disc is in a street sign motif (the street sign is designed to be like one from the little village where Belle and her father lived). From here, you can choose to play the movie (which will automatically default to the Special Edition version), setup (choose the spoken language and whether or not you want English for the hearing impaired captions), scene selection (the scene selection was done in a storybook setting, and there are 22 scene selections in all), see the bonus material, see an intro for a game that appears on disc two, and see \\"sneek peaks\\" of upcoming Disney releases (there are a total of seven \\"sneak peeks\\").<br /><br />If you go into the bonus features, you can choose to see the Special Edition version of the film (with or without audio commentary), the original theatrical film, the \\"work in progress\\" version of the film that was shown at the New York Film Festival in 1991, or you can see the film with a \\"Sing-Along\\" track to sing along with the songs in the film. The only thing different about the Special Edition is that a song originally cut from the film (\\"Human Again\\") is put back in; personally, I thought the new sequence helped to enhance the story. You get to see the enchanted objects excited about becoming human again, and you also get to see Belle and the beast getting even closer than you did in the original film. The \\"work in progress\\" version was interesting to watch, in order to see some of the animatics and storyboards for the sections of the film that were not completed in time for the festival; however, this is not a version of the film that I would watch very often. The audio commentary for the Special Edition was amusing and entertaining, and you learned a lot about what went on behind the scenes.<br /><br />Also included in the bonus material is \\"Maurice's Invention Workshop Game,\\" where a player helps Chip finish building Maurice's machine to get a code to open the castle door for the \\"Break the Spell\\" game on disc two. In order to play this game, the viewer needs to answer questions about the film by choosing one of the objects on the side of the screen that answers the question; the interface for this is to choose the answer by using the arrow keys on the player's remote. I thought the interface was a little cumbersome, and, overall the questions were rather simple (I assume this was done in order to make it easier for young kids to play the game).<br /><br />The second disc's menu has a stained glass window motif. There are four stained glass windows: Cogsworth and Lumiere, Chip, Mrs. Potts, and the rose (which is an entrance to the forbidden \\"west wing\\"). The first time you click on the rose window, the beast growls about that being the west wing, and that it is forbidden to go there. If you click on it a second time, it takes you to the \\"Break the Spell\\" game. You use the code you got from the game on disc one and enter the castle. You and Chip see in the magic mirror that the glass case has blown off the rose during the storm. You must follow Chip and complete tasks on the way. For each mistake you make, one petal falls off the rose. When five petals have fallen, the game is over, and no one becomes human again. I can't say much about the actual game itself, because I never made it past the first task (trying to avoid hitting candles on the dining table).<br /><br />If you choose Cogsworth and Lumiere's window, you get a lot of the background information about the film and musical (documentary-type pieces, artwork, etc.). Included here are \\"Origins of Beauty and the Beast,\\" development (which includes an early presentation reel), story (which includes an alternate version of \\"Be Our Guest\\" and the deleted song \\"Human Again\\" with storyboards), music (whichincludes an alternate score for the beast's transformation and the deleted song \\"Human Again\\" with storyboards), production design (including galleries for concept art, design and layouts, and backgrounds), animation (including animation tests, roughs, clean ups, and a pencil version of the beast's transformation), tricks of the trade (including a camera move test), release and reaction (including awards, Howard Ashman: In Memoriam, two theatrical trailers and four TV spots, original release and large format publicity galleries, and the music video for Celine Dion and Peabo Bryson's version of the theme song), and the Broadway musical (musical publicity gallery and costume design gallery).<br /><br />If you choose Chip's window, you get \\"Disney's Animation Magic\\" (a documentary hosted by the young stars of \\"Even Stevens,\\" which is designed to show kids how animation is done), the video for Jump 5's version of the theme song, and \\"Chip's Musical Challenge Game.\\" In the game, the player watches what objects are chosen for making the music, then the player must choose the items in the exact same order; again, this game utilizes the arrow buttons on the remote. This game was definitely intended for kids; as an adult, I found it to be rather tedious.<br /><br />If you choose Mrs. Potts' window, you get some documentaries, the music video for Celine Dion and Peabo Bryson's version of the theme song (which opens with Celine Dion talking about the song, and closes with an ad for soundtracks featuring Beauty and the Beast music), and \\"Mrs. Potts' Personality Profile Game\\" (after choosing your gender, Mrs. Potts asks you multiple choice questions; from your answers, she determines which Beauty and the Beast character you are most like). The main documentary, \\"Tales as Old as Time: The Making of Beauty and the Beast,\\" runs about 28 minutes long, is bookended by an opening and a closing by Celine Dion, and includes interviews with a number of people involved with the film. The other \\"documentaries\\" are \\"The Story Behind the Story,\\" where celebrity hosts reveal the stories behind seven other Disney films; this includes an introduction hosted by Celine Dion. Personally, I wonder why \\"The Story Behind the Story\\" section was included, since it has nothing to do with Beauty and the Beast (and the DVD already has quite a few extras on it).<br /><br />The magic mirror, which is also part of the interface of disc two, shows everything available.<br /><br />Despite the few faults I think the Beauty and the Beast (Platinum Edition) has, I feel that this DVD is a must-have for any DVD library.t's transformation and the deleted song \\"Human Again\\" with storyboards), production design (including galleries for concept art, design and layouts, and backgrounds), animation (including animation tests, roughs, clean ups, and a pencil version of the beast's transformation), tricks of the trade (including a camera move test), release and reaction (including awards, Howard Ashman: In Memoriam, two theatrical trailers and four TV spots, original release and large format publicity galleries, and the music video for Celine Dion and Peabo Bryson's version of the theme song), and the Broadway musical (musical publicity gallery and costume design gallery).

B000VBJEFK|5.0|Ratatouille is great! The story is sophisticated, genuine and lovable! Characters are great and everything was beyond excellent.    the video looked great! I was impressed with Cars, but not as much as Ratatouille. The colors are so vivid, and the contrast is done very well. Sepia tone in the kitchen is just.... amazing.    Extra are nice as well, it has a cooking game that's great for the kids.    ALL IN ALL, i was shocked that the film grew on me and that it looked so amazingly great on Blu-ray.    Its a perfect demo disc and its a definite must buy.
B00005JLEU|4.0|Spirited Away is a film directed by renowned anime director Hayao Miyazaki.  This was a critically acclaimed film, and even won the Oscar for Best Animated Feature.<br /><br />This coming-of-age story revolves around a spoiled 10-year-old girl named Chihiro.  She is unhappy about having to move to a new home and going to a new school.  While heading to their new home, the family takes a detour and end up in another world, one that is populated by spirits.  Chihiro's parents are turned into pigs, and she must find a way to survive in that world until she can rescue her parents.  This is a very well-done story, and the animation is simply exquisite.<br /><br />This DVD release includes a documentary about the film, the Nippon television special about the making of the film, a storyboard-to-scene comparison, a short documentary about dubbing in the English voices, and a collection of the original Japanese trailers for the film.<br /><br />Spirited Away is an anime masterpiece, and it will definitely continue to be an anime classic well into the future.
B000IU3XTW|5.0|BUY THIS NOW!  It's the next best thing to actually being at one of their shows.  Foo Fighters never disappoint, and this collection captures that energy.  It's a must have for any Foo fan.
B00005MAM2|3.0|This classic anime film was released in 1988 and became a landmark in the genre.  For its time, the animation was highly advanced.  It was also one of the few productions done in Japan at the time using prescoring.<br /><br />This is a story that takes place in Neo Tokyo in 1988 (a new Tokyo that was built after Tokyo was destroyed by a mysterious explosion).  In the course of this anime you see biker gangs and mutated children with precognitive abilities.  And for good measure, there is a corrupt government and terrorist insurgents trying to destabilize the government.<br /><br />The story itself is interesting, but yet it is also on the strange side and a bit confusing.  Ultimately, while this film is an anime classic, this is a film I probably wouldn't really give repeat viewings to.
B000NA28I4|1.0|You have GOT to be kidding me. I have read my share of Fantasy books, and I have a fairly decent collection of Fantasy movies as well. When a book or a film comes out that is in this genre, I give it some latitude, because we are talking about a fictional world, but this was such a horrific movie.<br /><br />No, I did not read the novel, and I am aware of the age of the author, which I doubt would have changed anything about this film either way. This film was such a huge empty calorie. There is plenty of screen time, and very little actual substance.<br /><br />First of all, when you have John Malkovich in a film, you have a wonderful villain. USE HIM! He had maybe a total of 5 minutes on screen, and it was in a little throne room with the villain that chased the hero ... how trite. If that is all the character has in the book, then you wasted money on paying for J.M. to be in the film, and not use his malevolency to its maximum.<br /><br />Secondly, what was with the dragon? It didn't look, bear with me, REAL. I know that it is CG, but come on. It looked more like a glorified Gila monster or something. And having a female voice that wasn't ... harsh ... what is that? \\"I am a celestial being from a heavenly planet?\\" No, it is a dragon that couldn't scare a sheep into fear. I was drawn into the movie for that alone, and I was disappointed.<br /><br />Third off, the character deaths were so lame. I am your mentor, I am dead! I am your enemy, I'm dead! No I'm not! Yes I am, this time for real. Hey, I know that your friend that you just met and now completely trust for no reason is here to replace your other friend that you knew for 30 minutes, and died revealing that he was, *GASP*, a dragon rider! Say it isn't so!<br /><br />Side note here, I loved how there was the, \\"We must walk from this point on; the horses cannot go this way,\\" as they walk along the flat, wide path with those horse-killing pebbles. I still laugh when I think about this part.<br /><br />Lastly, there is the ending. Well, I guess it was the end. The credits started rolling. That usually signifies the end of a movie. I didn't feel that anything was ... resolved. Yes, I am aware that there is a sequel, but make me want to see it because I WANT to, not because I HAVE to, to know what happens to the characters. I honestly don't care about any of the characters. Or the supposed \\"love interest\\" ... \\"I will see you again,\\" \\"I know you will\\" ... I'm thinking, not if I see you first ...<br /><br />Do Not Buy this Movie, do not rent it, do not even download it illegally ... it is a retched horrible movie!nd. The credits started rolling.

B00005JNDZ|5.0|Bridget is the best person all over the world, great movie for every one who do not believe in itself. She believed so you can do it, too.
B000URDEB0|5.0|I am one of those females in the \\"screw-Tarja\\" camp, yet I am not impressed with the singer. She's more mainstream, making the whole album sound decidedly more \\"pop-y\\"... that is not to say some of the songs seem a bit more \\"predictable,\\" (i.e. I think a little is Tuomas' fault) but the album is good nevertheless. Anette, IMO, is much better live than in person. She has more life in her live performance than on the album. I do like her very much but I think NW has a lots a little of it's \\"uniqueness.\\" One thing I really do like about Anette though is her English pronunciation. Tarja had a BIG problem with her English *cringe.*    Anyhoo, there are some gems in here and some that I'm okay with. I overheard some guy at the concert saying he liked this better... I think people like it more because there is a lot of \\"familiar\\" devices used in here... while nostalgia is good, I think sounding too \\"familiar\\" has it's drawbacks. Anyhoo, those songs in questions were done well. My favorites on the album are \\"Sahara\\", \\"Bye Bye Beautiful\\", \\"Seven Days to the Wolves\\", \\"the Islander\\", \\"Master Passion Greed\\" and \\"Last of the Wilds\\".     \\"The Islander\\" is an acoustic piece which some think is unexpected, but I think it is in keeping with the \\"soundtrack\\" theme of the whole album. I wish they would have added \\"While your lips are still red.\\" I thought that was a superior ballad to \\"Eva.\\"    Overall superior album... more upbeat (although the lyrics are not ^_^)... great!
0767827902|4.0|This review is based on the book by Larry McMurtry who also co-wrote the screen play. Most of the points made here about the book apply to the movie. I would only add that in the book the football coach's wife Ruth is given a more sympathetic portrayal. As for the rest Bottoms, Bridges and Cybil Sheppard do a good, if not great, job as youth in a dying, (or semi-dying) Texas boom town looking to get the hell out one way or another.      There has been no shortage of coming of age stories in modern American literature. J. D. Salinger's Catcher in the Rye is merely the most famous and probably widely known of the genre. Here Larry McMurtry, the Texas bibliophile, Old West aficionado and pack rat gives us his take on growing up absurd in a faded semi- boom town Texas during the Korean War era early 1950's.     Although the locale is different from Catcher in the Rye the issues raised by the teenagers who drive the story and those of their perplexed and clueless parents are the same. And what does those issues entail? Sex, the meaning of existence, sex, what to do on Friday night, sex, what to do on Saturday night, sex- well you get the drift. And those dilemmas of youth and its fight for recognition as presented through the main characters Sonny and Duane are in McMurtry's hands well thought out and, at times, poignant. The attention to detail that McMurtry is noted for is on full display in the interplay between the 'jock' students, the nerds and the 'in' crowd. High school football, the whys and wherefores of the high school classroom and the shear fight to find one's own identity in this mix all contribute to a very strong trip down memory lane for this reader.     From my own personal experience I know how tough it was to grow up in the 1950's and it is good to see that there are indeed some universal ailments that are common to the 'tribal community' called youth in America. Moreover, read this book because it also has a few things to say about the adults, especially Sonny's lover the older woman and the football coach's wife Ruth, and their dilemmas as well. Damn, McMurtry is singing my song.
B00003CX9W|5.0|It would be difficult to praise this film enough.  Disney took music to a new level when he imagined how music might look when animated.  The result alternates between drama and comedy, between whimsy and pathos.  The result is entertaining and fun and a grand vision of creative animation that has set a standard that has yet to be exceeded.<br /><br />The imaginings in this movie begin smoothly with Toccata and Fugue in D Minor.  Disney animators imagine what music might look like, with the clever use of abstract art.  The animation for this opening number is but a small taste of what is yet to come.<br /><br />The end of the Toccata takes us back to the orchestra we began with, leading next into a brilliant rendition of Tchaikovsky's Nutcracker Suite, featuring flowers, mushrooms, fish and fairies dancing flawlessly and whimsically.  I find temptation to use the words imagination and creativity endlessly in this review, because each of the pieces contains incredible amounts of each.<br /><br />The next selection features Disney icon Mickey Mouse in Paul Dukas's The Sorcerer's Apprentice.  Mickey discovers that using magic to make his life easier has a downside.  We benefit from a wonderfully performed piece of classical music well-matched with a clever story.<br /><br />Drama abounds in Stravinsky's The Rite of Spring, which shows the creation of the earth and the evolution of species through dinosaurs.  Purists may cry foul because species that existed in different eras appear together and T. Rex has three fingers instead of two, but the combination of music and animation is expressive and chilling as extinction reaches out to claim dinosaurs.<br /><br />After an intermission and an imagining of how waveforms might appear, presaging graphic equalizers and screen savers, Beethoven's Sixth Symphony provides the music for a world of mythology.  Centaurs, a Pegasus and family, cherubs, fauns, Greek gods, and assorted other creatures cavort in Grecian-inspired scenery.  This portion of the movie has generated significant criticism.  There is brief female centaur nudity and a centaur inspired by African American caricatures of the era, the latter of which would be unthinkable in modern film and the former would be unacceptable in modern children's films.  Versions released in recent decades have excised the African American inspired centaur, but the nudity remains.  I find the nudity unusual, but inoffensive.<br /><br />Amilcare Ponchielli's Dance of the Hours provides a vehicle for dancing ostriches, crocodiles, hippos, elephants and alligators in a classical setting.  The animation is incredibly frantic and humorous as the alligators give chase faster and faster, all the while missing out on a meal.<br /><br />The final segment features Mussorgsky's Night on Bald Mountain and Schubert's Ave Maria.  The Bald Mountain segment is the most dramatic portion of this film and contains elements that may be frightening to very young members of the family.  A demon appears on the mountain and raises an assortment of ghosts, skeletons, zombies and other fantastic creatures.  This segment ends with a segment showing a line of people walking through the forest to the song Ave Maria.<br /><br />The 60th anniversary release is the most complete version of this film that exists.  The scenes involving the stereotypical centaur are gone, but the film quality is otherwise the best it has been in many decades.  The original Leopold Stowkowski soundtrack has been restored as fully as possible.  Unfortunately, the narration by Deems Taylor had deteriorated to the point where it was unusable, and voice actor Corey Burton provided the updated narration.  The restoration is effective and brilliant.<br /><br />\\"Fantasia\\" remains a controversial film.  Some music critics lambasted the film because of the liberties Disney took with editing of some of the music.  Disney also received criticism because of the matching of Beethoven's music with mythological themes.<br /><br />The visual elements also contain aspects that are controversial to various segments of the population.  The depiction of nudity, however brief and non-sexual, always generates outcries from certain groups.  Other groups decry the depiction of pagan gods and mythological creatures as somehow promoting witchcraft and paganism.  The depiction of evolution rather than creationism also generates isolated indignation.<br /><br />What critics seem to forget is that \\"Fantasia\\" is an artistic interpretation.  The interpretations in the film are those of Disney and his animators, and they are neither right nor wrong, they are just art.  Fortunately, the vast majority of people will ignore the undeserved criticisms and focus on the unique achievement that \\"Fantasia\\" represents.  I doubt there will ever be another movie with the artistic scope and vision of \\"Fantasia,\\" which makes it even more precious and marvelous.  This movie is a great addition to the libraries of people who can appreciate the artistic vision Walt Disney tried to achieve.<br /><br />Enjoy!l to various segments of the population.

B000VBJEEG|5.0|What a wonderful film! I had the most intense urge to COOK something after watching this. As I have said before, Pixar cam seemingly do no wrong, and this film continues their winning ways. The detailing is amazing to see. The image of the Paris skyline at night could be used in a Parisian tourism ad. The wizards at Pixar get better at their craft with each picture. The story is touching as well, and that's what really counts: to be true to yourself and be what you're meant to be. The truly funniest parts are when Remy(the lead hero and main rodent) is learning to control Linguini(the clean-up boy of the restaurant) by means of pullng Linguini's hair. Way too funny! All in all, this film is as good as any of Pixar's films, and better than you might expect considering the main hero is a rat. Get this fine film on DVD and go to Paris and enjoy!

B000WCBMA8|5.0|I rarely give something brand new a 5-star rating, only because I tend to think that an item has to stand the quality test of time before I can comfortably say, \\"I love it!\\", but The Hives have quite simply secured my vote with their musical attitude.<br /><br />I first saw the Hives on one of those sinful MTV shows (movie awards? music awards? is there a difference?) and one of the corporate trend-analysts-cum-vee-jay was talking about the rise of the 'The' bands, and the next feature (after commercial) was to be a classic 'Battle of the Bands,' featuring The Hives and The Vines.<br /><br />As soon as the commercial break was over, and the so-called Battle began, it became quite clear who were MTV's boys.  The Vines played in the center of the ungodly large stage, and The Hives were set up in the furthest corner of stage right.  The 5 Hives were crammed together and of course played a tight rendition of \\"Hate to Say I Told You So\\" through an equalizer set-up that was probably done by the lowest intern on the food chain, while the 3 Vines strutted about in their MTV mansion and the singer did everything he could to make sure we thought that he didn't want to be there.  Of course, the cramped quarters worked wonders for The Hives, for a band that stands close together plays close together, while The Vines were trying too hard to not look like corporate lapdogs.<br /><br />Immediately, I knew that The Hives had something special going on, a purist energy that was both serious and playful, self-effacing and lacking the quality of giving a hoot about it, while The Vines were going to have a short career that would spiral into pretension and tediousness.  The Vines wanted to be a mix of Kim Gordon and The Beatles, while The Hives were there to play, damn the consequences and who might be listening (or not wanting to listen).  The kitschy matching suits, the bravado of their image (this album titles each band member His Royal Highness Prince)--all of it shows a desire in The Hives to make fun of themselves in their bravado, so that the real focus is always the music itself.<br /><br />While previous albums carried themselves on their tight, energetic, basement sound, this album has a little more refinement--but not so much to lose track of the fact that these guys are quite simply the most balls-to-the-wall band in the popular limelight right now.  From the head-bobbing energy of the first single, \\"Tick Tick Boom,\\" to the vocal meltdown into wordless energy in \\"Return the Favour,\\" The Hives have freneticism in spades.  There are, of course, some attempts for new direction with the lounge-meets-Zelda \\"A Stroll Through Hive Manor Corridors\\" and the almost disco drive of \\"T.H.E.H.I.V.E.S.\\" and the Swedish-country gallop of \\"Giddy Up!\\"  These are interesting tracks, especially since The Hives merely remind us that they think about their sound and are willing to try out something new, as long as it remains fun.<br /><br />By the time I finished my first listen, I wanted to go back to the beginning and go through it all again.

0143038419|5.0|Elizabeth Gilbert's memoir \\"Eat, Pray, Love\\" is a powerful travel, self-help and spiritual guide. In addition to her exquisite writing the book is fun, funny, profound and enlightening.<br />When I read Gilbert's eloquent description of entering the \\"void\\" in Chapter 67 I got goose bumps. I had just completed an article about my \\"void\\" journey titled, \\"The void: a steppingstone to enlightenment.\\"<br />Gilbert's book helped me better understand my experience. She said she got through the wormhole of the Absolute and suddenly understood the workings of the universe. She left her body, the room, the planet and stepped through time and entered the void. She said the void was a conscious, intelligent God. It was a place of limitless peace and wisdom and it was just as Kabir, the sage, said, \\"All know the drop merges into the ocean, but few know the ocean merges with the drop.\\"<br />Although Gilbert had a feeling of deep love she had no ego, euphoria or excitement. She had no experience of \\"I\\" but still had thoughts that were modest, quiet and observatory.<br />When she thought, \\"I want to hold onto this experience forever,\\" she tumbled out of the void.<br />Gilbert's book has 108 Chapters. What are the chances of my reading her two pages about the void just after writing about it myself?
B000UNYJXQ|2.0|Yep...It takes a real sicko to eat those people in the waiting room down to the bone and then have the audacity to put the picture right on the box art. Look, the film is entertaining, as are all his film. But as is typical for Michael Moore, it's filled with half truths. The man is a proven liar. It's true France has been rated the best health care system in the world. But it takes 20 minutes of fact checking to see that it is a system with it's own set of problems (bed shortages, high co-pay on some services, paying for someone else's sex change operations) and a growing number of people within the system who say that it is unsustainable in it's present form. Some even cite France's generally poor economy to it's lavish funding of it's health care system. Bare in mind that according to a French government website, the system is only for legal French citizens. I do not know how France deals with an illegal immigrant who needs medical attention but given the fact that it is against the law in France to even provide shelter to an illegal immigrant, I doubt the government takes it on the chin when the illegal can't pay. I also doubt that France has an illegal immigrant problem like we have here in the States. We are talking about millions of potential patients here in the U.S. who don't pay into the system but will still be treated. The whole ideal that \\"they do it there, so it will work here\\" is wishful thinking. We are not Norway. Norway has huge natural resources and the population of Oklahoma. Have you been to Oklahoma? It's about 5 million people. Now imagine Oklahoma with California's economy. Even so the cost of living in Norway is 30% higher than the U.S. Not to mention that the Norwegian people value things like work and education much more so than too many Americans. Lastly, while I agree that we need a better health care system (which I think would be better served by private industry), having the U.S. Government run it would be a complete disaster. Do you want to see U.S. Government run health care? Look at the Veterns Administration and Indian (Native American) Health. I've been a patient in both those systems and if that's an example of the government running hospitals, then forget it.want to see U.S. Government run health care?

B000Q9IZ5C|5.0|What can I say......   it's \\"Serenity\\"!   I really didn't need the Collector's Edition, but there's no way I was passing it up.  There's not a whole lot extra, but the box is worth it!
B0000640S2|5.0|It's getting a little chilly here in the North Pole so, Sid recently took a trip to Vietnam with his old pal John Rambo. He managed to avoid all the gunfire and explosions to make it home and write this world-class review. In Rambo II, Sly Stallone is assigned a mission to free American POWs 11 years after the war ended. Thanks for the effort guys! Anyway, this was Sly at his Cold War propaganda peak. He put out Rambo II and Rock IV in the same year. I'm not sure what happened to Sly. Was he picked on by a Russian bully when he was a kid? Because he takes shots at the Russians in this one too.<br /><br />There are a number of notable actors in this flick. You have the bad guy from Beverly Hills Cop, who's possibly a little sweet in that one. We thought we had a Mr. Braden from Lockup sighting in the begining, but that could not be confirmed. There was the evil sensei from Karate Kid, who dissapointed us by not giving Rambo a \\"Mercy is for the weak...\\" speech. And you had...Mr. Chan from you know where it's going Death Ring. Oh, and the closing credits song was done by none other than the immortal Frank Stallone.<br /><br />Obviously, Rambo is the man. He was sensitive. He fell in love with the Vietmineese chick in about 2 seconds, leading to the most shocking/uncomfortable/horribly acted sequense of the film. It was a great 30 second swing. He was the inspiration for the guy you always were in one player Contra, and has an endless supply of ammo. I mean, the guy used a bow with exploding tip arrows. You can't put a price on that kind of B. For us, the highlight of the flick was when Rambo meets Mr. Chan. Chan must shoot at Rambo 50 times, and Rambo is as calm as can be, taking his time to set up the perfect shot, and...he shoots Mr. Chan with an exploding tip arrow and Mr. Chan actuall blows up! Words cannot do this justice. See the movie. We're imploring you!<br /><br />Sid's two halves could not decide if Rambo II or Redline was the movie that made the least sense of all-time. We should have just said that to make you see this classic because that's what Rambo II is. We swear, you will freaking love it.ld have just said that to make you see this classic because that's what Rambo II is. We swear, you will freaking love it.
B000UZ4EP2|4.0|I have this cd 3 weeks now. I like it very much, it's a very moving and enchanting cd. It's always difficult buying a cd based on some pieces of music from about 30 seconds. But talking about Maire/Moya Brennan you never buy a pig in a poke (my personal opinion). Just sit back in a quiet place and enjoy this music. No yoga can compare with this. I hope there are more cd's from her to come.

0634049011|5.0|I've purchased a dozen or more books of this genre.  This is the first that'd recommend enthusiastically.  The \\"workbook\\" method outlined here is the fastest and most enjoyable I have experienced.  Each building block is learned via a slick combination of visual \\"tricks\\" and vocal/written exercises that cement and connect them.    This and \\"The Guitar Cookbook\\" are what I would now suggest to a niece or nephew moving up past simple chords.
B000VI70WM|1.0|This is a perfect example of what I tell my clients when they enter my studio. KNOW YOUR MARKET !!!  This album is a complete train wreck !! Thank God that Amazon has audio preview, I didn't waste my money. I don't blame Duran Duran for this....some suit that sits in an office trying to make a buck did this. Who's \\"brilliant\\" idea was it to use these producers for this album? This sounds like a bad night at Karaoke. The music tracks have NOTHING to do with Duran Duran's sound and makes Simon sound like he's never sung before. There is a complete LACK of feeling in his voice. It sounds like he's singing with a gun to his head. This is NOT what true Duran Duran fans want to hear. A note to the record company execs : this formula doesn't work anymore !! It may work in Rap/Hip Hop still by taking Artists who want to rekindle/start their career by sticking a popular producer/feature on the album to give it merit, this was NOT the group to do this to. They would have been better off producing this on their own.    Of course I will not critcize without offering a solution. Amazon actually helped with this solution. \\"Customers who bought this item also bought\\" . When you look at this list, it is always the same list of artists.   Why not have these artists create original singles to be compiled on to one CD? What about cross producing each other's Cd's ? Duran Duran has a particular sound from a specific time and shares this with a handful of other artists such as Depeche Mode, Pet Shop Boys, Annie Lennox, Erasure, and the list goes on. You get the point? I understand that, to the record execs,  this may be more WORK to sell the same amount of CD's/Downloads , but what about making GOOD MUSIC ?!! The artists above have had multiple Singles hit from one album. What happened to making albums like this anymore? Luckily, the consumer now has a choice and they can buy the ONE song they like from an album and leave the rest behind. What a waste of good/expensive studio time !!!
1591391105|1.0|I tried to read this book.  I hate, hate, hated it.  It was dry, boring and uninspiring.  I much preferred First Time Manager by Loren Belker and Gary Topchik.  I know this book has a lot of positive reviews, but it failed to capture my attention.
B000J3EEBY|4.0|I like this new cd from Loreena. I have all her previous cd's but this one again is better. I always play her cd's when I need some rest in my head and this one is no exception. It's better then having therapy. Especially track 8 (Beneath a Phrygian sky) is wonderful but as always with beautiful tracks, far too short (it's 9.29 minutes!).
B000022TSH|5.0|An Oldie but one of my favorites. Thay don't make them the way they used to anymore. Highly recommended.
B00008LDPU|5.0|I predict that digital computing will be fading away in probably about 15 years or so; Quantum computing will be the future and because of the theoretical capabilities of Q.C. of mimicking the human brain (which it works based on Quantum Mechanics) this movie, by then, might not look like fiction anymore.
B0002VEPRQ|5.0|Disney's Mary Poppins is an amazing movie. Back in its day, no one had ever really seen animated characters dancing alongside real humans, and Disney made this possible. Mary Poppins has stood the test of time, making it a Disney Classic, and for many years to come. This movie is excellent for the young, and young at heart. The tunes get your feet tapping and you sing the songs, and when it's over, you want to watch it all over again(or buy the CD)! This is a great movie for the whole family, brought to you by Disney.
B000O75F7C|4.0|Instrumentally and melodically, this is a brilliant album, quite possibly their best. Gavin Harrison's talent with percussion is especially impressive, mind-boggling and entertaining.    But lyrically, it's the Final Cut, a la Steve Wilson.  Been there, heard that. Celebrations of dark, unhappy childhoods have become so cliché, I just want to say, \\"it's in the past, get over it, life's too short to sulk.\\" Show me something new.
0143038419|1.0|I was hopeful for this book--especially because it comes with a blurb by Ann Lammot on the cover, whose \\"Traveling Mercies\\" is a great read about finding God and faith.  But \\"Eat, Pray, Love\\" doesn't deliver what I'd hoped.  I got tired of the author telling me how many other people called her \\"cute\\" and how social and open and friendly she is and so on.  She struck me as an ebullient fourth grader. Cute? Sure, but her brand of emotional immaturity doesn't wear so well on a thirty-something-year-old.       A friend of mine (we read it in tandem) said, \\"Maybe this book is like that mantra [the author] had to say that she hated in India.  Maybe I'll get something out of it if I just stick with it.\\"  Alas, neither of us found much reward.    The writing is stellar, really: descriptive, strong.  Elizabeth Gilbert can tell a story.  But I never did fall in love with her.  I didn't even fall into like with her.  She remains separate, cute, and even worse: cute-sy throughout.
B000W1V44I|5.0|This is the best BSB album yet.  The Boys keep getting better and better.  Every song is a masterpiece.  Anyone who says BSB is just a Boy band needs to get their heads out of the toilet and take a listen to the new album.
6305784116|5.0|Can't go wrong with this. Very cute, but if you're picky about being PC, one or two character's are sterotyped. It was made in the 70's; so you just have to remember that. Totally recommend it.

B00007AJF9|5.0|While not necessarily very historically accurate, Shekhar Kapur's Elizabeth, is a veritable feast for the eyes. Shekhar's Bollywood background probably inspired the vivid imagery, the vibrant colors as well as some of the song-and-dance routines. The rest of the story is known to virtually any student of history.  Elizabeth ascends the throne upon the death of her half-sister Catholic Mary (who had done everything that she possibly could to prevent the Protestant Elizabeth from becoming the monarch). She ascends at a time when the country is divided in two along religious fault lines. The kingdom is at its weakest and most of Elizabeth's advisors think that the only way to bring stability is for Elizabeth to get married. Not so, thinks her majesty. Definitely worth watching.
0143038419|5.0|I loved this book! I've read the reviewers who gave Elizabeth Gilbert one or two stars and their major complaints seem to be 'narcissim'. Folks, this book is a MEMOIRE! If you don't want to read about one woman's journey then don't read this book.   On the other hand if you are going through life's regular turmoils, this book is for you. It's honest, candid, yes judgemental at times (who isn't) but she writes like she's having a conversation with you. Absolutely fabulous. I had no idea that other have fallen apart on the bathroom floor, until I read this book. She talks about things that no one wants to - like the 'need' for spiritual connection that is often seen as weak in this society.   I dislike that although she identifies as broke (in the beginning) she still has white priviledge, enough to be able to make back all the money (and more) she lost in her divorce. That aside, the writing and book itself is worth while.
B00003CX9S|5.0|The Elephant Man is the finest film I've seen.  This true story has very   emotional performances by an excellent cast, especially John Hurt in the   title role.  This is a great atmospheric film superbly filmed in black   and white.  It is masterfully directed by David Lynch.  It also has a   beautiful and mesmerizing musical score.  An unforgettable film!     I also recommend buying the movie soundtrack, which is available on CD.

No regret.
6304806434|4.0|Generally I'm not a fan of Hollywood blockbuster action movies. These days they mostly rely on CGI effects, have no characterisation and really are only worth seeing once. Con Air is the exception to that rule. I must have watched this film 7 or 8 times in the first five years after it came out.<br /><br />The main reason its so watchable is the cast: Nicholas Cage, John Cusack, John Malkovich and Steve Buscemi are all, given the right material, excellent actors. Here they are put to good use. Cage is a US Ranger hitching a lift back in a airbourne jail/transport plane. He's just been released from prison, but don't worry he's a good guy. The rest of the plane is full of the baddest of Americas bad criminals. Some of them, like Buscemi's Garland Greene (an appalling serial killer) are complete fruitcakes and he arrives on the plane in a secure steel box. Buscemi is brilliant. He only has a few lines of dialog in the whole film and steals the acting honours from the rest of the cast. Naturally the plane full criminals escape and all hell breaks loose. Fortunately inbetween the carnage and violence there are also a few nice comedic touches as well, which is relief.<br /><br />The ending is perhaps the weakest point of the film where it does degenerate into a typical blockbuster movie. Overall though, its great entertainment thats in a different class from most bloated blockbusters. This is a rollercoaster ride you won't want to get off....
0312117337|5.0|This is the most beautiful deck I have ever owned. I am weary of using systems that reinforce the heterosexual patriarchal conceptions of being and hence usually use decks created by women such as Mother Goddess Tarot, Daughters of the Moon that have an androgynous \\"lovers\\" card, but this deck is too beatiful too pass up. It's best used as a daily meditation as it is not 'tarot' in the traditional sense.
B000KWZ7VU|5.0|The DVD Barenboim on Beethoven is one of the very best DVDs I have ever owned.   A great investment especially if you are trying to introduce wonderful music to a young person.  Also it is a DVD you are able to watch over and over again for many years.  The Master classes are excellent, and the concerts given by Mr. Barenboim are just wonderful to say the very least.    Of course I must add that I am a fan of Mr Barenboim, Lang Lang and of course Beethoven.
B000OLGCI4|5.0|This is my favorite Disney movie, and the only one I own. Jungle Book is a fun, timeless story with fantastic songs that stay in your head for days. It's truly enjoyable for both kids and adults. They don't make them like this any more!
B000P0J09C|5.0|Kubricks Full Metal Jacket deserves it place alongside 'The Deer Hunter', 'Platoon' and 'Apocalypse Now' as the definitive Vietnam war movies.<br /><br />FMJ is split into two distinct halfs, training and battle. This is unusual in a film, as the standard rule when writing a story is to have a beginning, a middle and an end. Obviously there are always exceptions, and in this case it works because the two part story reflects the grim reality of war. In truth if you can't survive the training there probably isn't much hope for you at war.<br /><br />The performances are uniformly excellent. More importantly the ending is really quite shocking. If you have seen Dr Strangelove you will realise that this probably reflected Kubricks own view on war. Watching the film again twenty years later, and baring in mind the problems in Iraq and Afganistan it does make you think.<br /><br />A great film.
B000RIHBIE|3.0|Sum 41 are one of those bands that you can kind of call a one-album wonder, because their second album All Killer No Filler was really the only time a lot of people were talking about them. And I think I was the only person that picked up their fourth album Chuck, but they still decided to come back with Underclass Hero.<br /><br />Although the lead guitarist has left the band, the music doesn't sound a whole lot different from previous material. This is especially evidenced by the title track, which, as another reviewer said, sounds just like \\"Fat Lip\\". And one surprising thing is that Deryck and the boys are actually better now at mellow songs than the regular material, like \\"With Me\\", \\"So Long Goodbye\\" and \\"Best of Me\\".<br /><br />With that said, the faster songs that Sum 41 are more known for really don't impress. \\"The Jester\\" just zooms by, \\"Speak of the Devil\\" makes no sense, and \\"Walking Disaster\\" proves that trying to be a deep storyteller doesn't work for everyone. And although I'm normally a fan of anti-Bush songs, even I'LL say that \\"March of the Dogs\\" is going a little too far. Underclass Hero is really the kind of album that makes you wonder if the band is running out of ideas, so only buy it if you have all their other albums.<br /><br />Anthony Rupert

You're blamed for the murder,but escape on the Chicago Limited, as a nationwide APB is issued for your arrest. Aboard the train you're befriended by a female double agent who first protects you from the police,then arranges your death the following afternoon in an Indiana cornfield beneath the wheels of a malevolent cropduster! All this in a little over an hour of viewing time.Absurd? Of course it is! And, there's plenty more to come. Just hang on for what a really great movie should be-entertainment at its best.
B000127LW2|3.0|It's hard to type because of the tears in my eyes as I was laughing so hard when I saw the price of this series. I only checked on this series as I was going through withdrawals, having purchased all the other Star Trek stuff... wow... Somebody at the studio has been drinkin' some raw Romulan Ale!
B000M06K5C|5.0|Frankly, I couldn't disagree more with those who hold the view that this album is inferior to Silent Alarm - it is FAR better. On balance, \\"Weekend in the City\\" is a more mature recording, not only musically but also lyrically. They've retained much of the sound that made Silent Alarm stand out, but have, if anything, expanded their reach. In general the lyrics are more accessible than on the predecessor, covering a broad range of topics from xenophobia, homophobia, racism and drug addiction to urban street life and love. More so than on Silent Alarm, lead singer and songwriter Kele wears his heart on his sleeve and gives us some insights into his inner turmoil. In Kreuzberg we find him \\"Crying again in the Hauptbahnhof\\" after a fleeting love affair that ends in heartbreak. This beautifully plaintive song is, for me, the highlight of the CD, closely followed by the magnicent Uniform, a thundering fusilade against teen materialism and uniformity. Like on Silent Alarm, there are at least five tracks that could make great singles, bearing in mind that \\"The Prayer\\", \\"I Still Remember\\" and \\"Hunting for Witches\\" have already been released. Amazingly, there`s a whole album worth of B-sides and extras out there, some of which are absolutely terrific. If you can, check out \\"Cain Said to Abel\\" (this one rocks), \\"England\\" and \\"The Once and Future King\\", not to mention the latest single \\"Flux\\". Like the Prince of old, these guys are not only good but also prolific.

Four Irish singers with superb voices (one of whom accompanies herself on the harp), one pixielike lady violinist who dances around the stage whilst playing, two creative drummers who so obviously enjoy their 'work' and the musical director who put it all together make for a delightful hour and a half's entertainment.  Interviews with the participants included.  Have also purchased their second DVD, Celtic Woman, A New Journey, set in Slane Castle.  Extra includes how production was put together.  Again, magical.

B000VBJEFK|2.0|After loving the movie in the theater, I was excited to buy the blu-ray to share it with friends who have not seen it yet.  I have the latest Samsung blu-ray player (BDP-1400) and the disc freezes up when I try to enter the set up menu. Updating the firware improved the load times (it was extremely slow before) but the freezing is still there.  Too many previews are also annoying. Another issue is that the movie is in 2.39:1 aspect ratio which results in horizontal bars.  I understand that it's the original aspect ratio, however, it does take away from the feeling of being immersed in the film.  Another issue is an on-screen button that shows up occasionally suggesting to switch to a different camera angle. I have not been able to turn this off so far and it's annoying to have it pop up during the movie.  The function to swtich the angle does not work for some reason on this disc.  It's a shame such an excellent movie is implemented so poorly on Blu-ray.  Disney did not need to do anything with this film but to release it on Blu-ray to have a home run.  By overloading it with features that will disappoint a lot of people.  Interactive features are wonderful but there should be a simple option to put in the disc and watch a movie without having to deal with anything else.
B000Y179KO|3.0|The diffence between The Long Run and Long Road out of Eden, is that Glenn Frey and Don Henley have effectively taken over, and allow no dissent whatsoever. Walsh and Schmitt are apparently  intimidated and scared to raise their voices in fear they will be fired like Felder.  Glenn Frey has TOO MANY songs on this cd.  Henley has a couple too many as well. Glenn Frey has chased away anyone with musicianship and a spine in this group over the years: Bernie Leadon, Randy Meisner and now Don Felder. Frey now owns the room, but it's an empty one. This Eagle no longer can fly.

Finally, I've got the Monterey performance of \\"Killing Floor\\" on CD again! (One of my all-time favorite Jimi moments).  Packaging is nice as well, although I'm not a big fan of digipaks.  If you have never heard or seen this performance or are new to Jimi's music, seek these releases out ... you will not be disappointed.  Now if EH can get the ball rolling on the Royal Albert Hall gig ... ;)
B000Y179KO|5.0|as much as i have cherished all of this band's music over the years, i must say this may be their very best ever!  it is the one album i hum nearly every song all day long...my personal favorite is glenn frey on \\"what do i do with my heart?\\" the emotional plea from someone we have all been, at one time or another.  what makes this song even more plaintive is don henley taking over the vocal near the end.  thank you for all the music, all these years and ESPECIALLY this music, this year!
B000EQ47HC|5.0|This CD brought back alot of old memories also as well as the other CD's I've  ordered.
0060090383|2.0|this book was sooo boring and depressing.  I'm surprised I finished it.  Rachel's (main character) experience at the treatment center reminded me of the book, \\"A million pieces\\".  I bought \\"Anybody out there?\\" and \\"watermelon\\".  I should have finished this book before i bought those books.   I hope those aren't as depressing as this book.
B000UR9T8C|1.0|Spider-Man 3 was a soap opera badly disguised as a superhero movie. As other reviewers have said, there were too many villians--each with enough background for their own installment in the franchise. This movie should have been about The Sandman (with a less stupid origin) and Harry Osborne. Venom should have only been a set-up to Spider-Man 4.      Anyone who thinks any of the Spider-Man movies were good just doesn't know Spider-Man. I would suggest that if you really want a true Spidey experience, buy any of the Ultimate Spider-Man trade paperback volumes and see exactly what I'm talking about.     I'm pretty sure that if another Spider-Man movie gets made, people will watch it. But if we've learned anything from Batman Begins, it's that there is always room for a second chance.  And that is exactly what this franchise needs.
B000VBP382|5.0|Yes, the same extras are in this set as are in the original release, but it also contains extras that were previously only available on the region 2 release.  It also has both the widescreen and the fullscreen versions of the movie and the soundtrack.    Granted, if you already own the single disc and the soundtrack you might not care, but there are a lot of people out there who still don't own this beautiful film and they will most likely enjoy this set.      It's still Pride & Prejudice and I still want to own it.  So I do.

B000VNMMQQ|4.0|The is a great movie, Bruce Willis doing a bang up job that he always does. The cast is outstanding like always, this is a Full review.
B000WCBPOG|5.0|I saw this movie on a whim one night with my roommate.  Immediately after seeing the film, I went out and bought the CD.<br /><br />This was 3 weeks ago, and it hasn't come out of my car since that night-- it is fantastic. It's like calorie-free chocolate cake for your ears.
0843175109|5.0|Mr Tall is a tall man. Well, he's just got really long legs, hasn't he? This makes him sad, and this sadness is what makes the book, I feel. It's bittersweet and romantic and brilliant.
B000Y179KO|5.0|I couldn't wait to buy this CD when I heard it was being made and I am not disappointed.  It's the best album I've bought in years!  Thanks to all the members of the Eagles for getting together and doing what you do best and that is making great and lasting music!  I love it and hope to hear more new music from this talented group!  Way to go, guys!!
B000IU3XU6|5.0|This CD/DVD set is absolutely wonderful. I especially enjoyed hearing Josh tell about making them.  He is so gifted.  His music and words just sweep me off my feet.
B000ICL3KG|5.0|If you don't believe in global warming, you're wrong. Want to be dumb? Fine. This document is great.
B000ICL3KG|5.0|I found this movie to be very eye opening.  Mr. Gore presented the data in a way this is informative, easy to understand and very convincing.  I would recommend that this DVD be shown to school age children beginning in middle school.  Perhaps our future generations will see the importance of taking care of the Earth so that a good quality of life will be available to future generations.  It is absolutely incomprehensible that there are still skeptics out there who refuse to listen and believe the data or recognize the damage we are doing to the environment.
B000003C2S|5.0|This is a great cd by a great band. If you can find the reamastered version get it. It is really hard to find and I got it by accident. The vocals are a bit more coherent than other albums but still gutteral and crazy. Altering the future and Spiritual healing are pretty long but build up to cool guitar solos. Defensive personalities and lowlife have crazy good riffage that stays in your head for days. The starting track is called Living Monstrosity. It is a monster of a song. After two speed based albums with gore lyrics Death redefines their music into a more technical reality based band. Still worth getting but get the remastered version. It sounds better and louder.
B000JBXXZ4|5.0|but what some may say shows that they \\"sold out\\" or are \\"losing the magic\\" I just see as change which has always been in their catalog and varied ways to get there point across.<br /><br />It's weird but Oil and Water and Anna Molly are pretty much the first Incubus songs that I can shake my butt too! Sure, that's a bad thing to some but I love it!<br /><br />Incubus has always put their emotion in the forefront with the awesome vocals and that is still here. The production to most of the songs is varied to a tee. (Check out Quicksand and then Dig and then A Kiss To Send Us Off).<br /><br />But most of you know what this album entails so far. It did come out in 2006 and many of you have had the pleasure of it being ingrained in your very minds or having to live with this \\"disappointment\\".<br /><br />Thank goodness that I am on my way to join the former and that this is my second favorite album by Incubus. The underrated A Crow Left Of The Murder being my first. But honestly, this one might grow to being the best.<br /><br />The only \\"weak tracks\\" in my opinion are Light Grenades (it's just there) and Pendulous Threads which just goes on. They are both heavy ??? but don't go anywhere really, especially LG. But that's my opinion.<br /><br />Earth To Bella Part II is another headscratcher but it's tolerable. It's just nothing like the first. It's quieter and then you hear Brandon harmonizing over and over. It's kinda freaky. LOL<br /><br />Key tracks thus far are:<br /><br />Anna Molly<br />Earth To Bella Part I<br />Paper Shoes<br />Oil And Water<br />Dig<br /><br />4.5 stars.<br /><br />I think the biggest surprise for me is how almost all the songs sound different. Yes, we're used to that with my favorite band ever. HOWEVER, it has a bit of everything for all old and new Incubus fans. HOWEVER, if you didn't like A Crow Left Of The Murder, I'm afraid that you should pass on this. It's all about the slower mid-tempos focused on love gone bad. I have always loved the softer side of them and this is why this album is my second favorite, possibly on the way to being my favorite.<br /><br />Oh. And picking favorites was as tough as nails!g my favorite.    Oh. And picking favorites was as tough as nails!
0446691437|5.0|This was an excellent book.  Puts into perspective the war and battle we rage within ourselves and work environments to have \\"ART\\" in whatever we profess to do.

B00003CWPL|4.0|Plot: A movie involving a man living in what looks to be a post apocalyptic world. He and his wife have a deformed baby. Also a man that lives in a planet, a singing lady in a radiator and bleeding trees.. Thats about all I can tell you of the plot of this movie.<br /><br />From that point on the rest is strictly left open to interpretation....<br /><br />I went through multiple possible meanings. One possibility was I thought everything was dreamed up by him or he was the baby and then finally breaks free from whatever was holding him back.. The true meaning is almost impossible to figure out for sure and I cant stop thinking about what it could have meant. I still have a feeling it was about more than meets the eye, more than just a deformed baby and adulthood- I think it was either about something sexual or something in his head.. maybe inner fears. For instance some kind of psychological inner war with yourself kind of thing or it could have all just been a dream.<br /><br />I heard this movie was supposedly disturbing... it wasnt. It was like a dream almost. You feel like you are in a another world when watching this movie. Almost transe-like. With this movie its all about the sounds and images more than dialogue.<br /><br />I read David Lynch said there is a specific meaning and nobody has figured it out yet.. hopefully one day he will say what this movie meant. This was more than a movie, it was an experience.
1878424505|5.0|I had heard mixed reviews about The Four Agreements for a while now but I finally decided to pick it up. I only purchased it a few days ago and I only have maybe 20 more pages left to read. That being said...  This book is wonderful and a must read for anyone into personal development! The ideas seem so simple and like with common sense we should already know these things and put them into play in our lives but it's so very interesting WHY we don't, or have difficult doing so. For such a short book there is so much wisdom that I feel can help everyone evolve in life and their relationships. I won't go into the specifics as I see that others have done a clear job of it but I just wanted to state my opinion.  I have already noticed some changes in my life as well as my relationship with my husband. I am looking forward to him reading The Four Agreements just as soon as I am finished so we can grow together. I am looking forward to seeing what this will also do for my business relationships.
B00006DEF9|5.0|This is a great DVD with lots of extras.  You'll find yourself humming these songs weeks after you watch it!  Of course, Amazon service is always exemplary as well.
B000957O7S|5.0|I have always liked Will Smith and Kevin James... put the two together and you get a classic. I loved this movie! It was funny, cute and charming. My husband even liked it! So it is a chick flick for all! :-) I hope Will Smith does more romantic comedies. He was made for them.:-) And Kevin Smith is just plain adorable. The female leads were great too. But can't remember their names. Sorry! I have already watched this movie ten times!! ENJOY! Donna
0783240236|5.0|This is such a classic film by the master of all suspense films, Hitchcock.  Set in Northern California on the coast, it shatters the \\"cocoon\\" of a small town's security with unexplained and illogical events.  The buildup, the subtle anticipation, they are so perfect in this film.  We've watched it so often my daughter has made a trivia game about it!!  You'll love it.
B000WCDI5K|5.0|I love the killers and have been a huge fan since \\"Hot Fuse\\".   I was really happy that in April of 2007 I got to see them in concert in Phoenix, Arizona. I'm glad that \\"The Killer\\" released an album of  compilation of B-sides, rarities and remixes to hold us Killer fans over till the new studio album in 2008.      What I'm most excited about is that after 3 Years the \\" Murder Trilogy\\" is now complete!   They way I have interpreted the \\"Murder Triogy\\" is this:  'Jenny was a friend of mine' and 'Midnight Show' are two thirds of a trilogy of songs. They chronicle the murder of a girl named Jenny. In the first song, Brandon is seemingly interrogated over a crime he claims to have not committed. In 'Midnight Show', he tells the story of how the jealous murder came about. The two songs are linked with the lyric, \\"She said she loved me\\". The third song is a song called \\"Leave the Bourbon on the Shelf\\" and is supposed to explain why Jenny was murdered.    The \\"OTHER\\" orrder I have heard is:    1) Leave The Bourbon On The Shelf  2) Midnight Show (about the actual murder of a girlfriend who wasn't being faithful)   3) Jenny Was A Friend Of Mine (The murderer is being interrogated by police. )    Thanks for a great CD, and thanks for finally giving us all 3 parts of the \\"Murder Trilogy\\"!    In an interview Lead singer Brandon Flowers says, \\"The murder has something to do with water, but it's not drowning.\\"
1844137872|5.0|This is an amazing book full of beautiful pictures of some of the best stencil street art in the world.  Banksy's tongue in cheek humour never ceases to bring a smile to your face and a lit bottle of gasoline to your throwing arm.
B000IFQLSW|5.0|I'm impressed by the effort made to create this dvd, the music cd is good but the real GEM is the movie,<br />some of these folks will never be seen again, but they live on in our hearts! BUY THIS before it is gone then support the living artists by finding and listening to their other works.
B000WCBMA8|5.0|the Hives have made the worlds first perfect album, but who is really surprised by that fact? Everyone that is a Hives fan knows how awesome they are and is in no way surprised, the people that aren't yet Hives fans will no doubt be fans now.
B00004Y6NP|5.0|Any rock fan must have this album, doubly so for any guitar fan.  Mark Knopfler's unique style is showcased quite nicely.  I really like this album for the deep cuts like \\"Ride Across the River\\" and \\"The Man's to Strong.\\"
B00008PX8P|3.0|I enjoyed seeing the Zeppelin concert clips. It was neat seeing them over the years. It would have been nicer if they had more extras - interviews, behind the scenes, etc..
0891419195|5.0|Sledge has detailed[[ASIN:0891419195 With the Old Breed: At Peleliu and Okinawa]] the war in the Pacific at a level I have not seen before.  His attention to detail and lack of sanitation of the day-to-day events of these two campaigns defines the dirty truth of combat.  If you can't stomach the blood and guts of warfare in the trenches, don't pick up this book.  This will certainly get your attention.  It did mine.
B000TUXL2A|4.0|An excellent album, with engaging lyrics and the beautiful Knopfler guitar.  I disagree with the comparison to \\"Ragpicker's Dream,\\" which is the weakest of Knopfler's albums.  While this does not have as many memorable tunes as \\"Sailing to Philadelphia,\\" it is a more immediate and moving album than \\"Ragpicker.\\"  I love Knopfler's stuff, but I do think he suffers a bit from the one-man-playing-around-in-the-studio syndrome, an image underscored by the photos on this disc.  Each album tends to have a few duds on it and a few great songs.  But if you like Knopfler's other work, you'll find this album rewarding.
0761145613|5.0|I have purchased this calendar for 6 years in a row.  There isn't a better calendar for a family that has to keep track of (up to) 5 busy schedules.

B000ICL3KG|5.0|An excellent portrayal of man utterly destroying his own home.      A excellent teaching tool best geared toward middle and high school age youngsters.
B000T2OMX0|5.0|I'm from Europe. My comment will be short. This is one of the top-10 CDs on Bach since it has been released (one or two months ago). Give it a try (it would be nice if you can hear good samples in an acceptable music set). In my opinion this recording of the cello suites is the among the best together with the ones by Pablo Casals, Yo-Yo-Ma and the rare and dificult to find by the swiss cellist Esther Nyffenegger.    Very good sound, it's Bach and it has a dancing mood.
B000002UJQ|5.0|I agree most of the reviews pertaining to this Album...it's an absolute joy to hear this masterpiece each and every time.  I've had this CD since it came out and even today, it's just as enjoyable paying special attention to the complexity of this music.  Don't give up on this music!  I like many have bought some of their other CD's only to be initially un-impressed.  Give it time, the more you listen, the better they get.  This music will become a favorite in anyone's collection.    Radiohead Rules!
B000UGG39Q|5.0|Down is a southern stoner metal band featuring numerous member's of high quality metal act's such as Phil Anselmo (Pantera), Jimmy Bower (Eyehategod, Crowbar), Pepper Keenan (Corrosion of Conformity), Rex (Pantera), and Kirk Windstein (Crowbar).<br />The music is in the vein of Black Sabbath, Pantera, Led Zeppelin or Danzig, with a southern stoner metal vibe. Anybody who are fan's of the previous band's mentioned should give this album a listen. This is one of the best metal/rock band's out there right now and it's great to see them back in the saddle.<br />Down's third album is a whole different monster than NOLA but this is not a bad thing (even though honestly I was hoping for a return to the NOLA sound). When I first listened to a couple of song's on the internet, I honestly was not that impressed at all, and it even took me a couple of week's to actually pick up the record, just because I was hoping for that NOLA sound. I could not have been more wrong.<br />Over the Under is a more musical album with weaving guitar lines and harmonie's with better structeres than some of their previous work. The sound is a lot thicker and tight than anything they have released so far and while it's not AS heavy as NOLA, it's makes up for it in songwriting skill's and great molodies.<br />This album just refuses to leave my car stereo no matter how hard I plead with it.
0345409671|3.0|Well, Anne can certainly Spin a grand tale that keeps you turning those pages faster and faster.  The subject kept me right up to the very end, then I don't know what the hell happened.  I did love her interpretation of God.  Someone you can't wait to meet and be with.  Jesus on the way to the cross was another superb interp.  I felt that she gave so much to the main part of the book that she just so sort of dwindled away.  Maybe I lost my focus, but I couldn't wait to see what happened and how all of this was going to come out.  I was not satisfied, by any means.  Several of her books do that...
B00008S2VG|5.0|As a child of the 80's, I was a crazed-Madonna-fanatic. I literally grew up with Madonna. Everything she did was always such a huge, world-wide spectacle. Because, Madonna was once, arguably, the most famous human being on this entire planet. And, more than a decade before Kathy Griffin coined the phrase, Madonna really did have millions of her very own g-a-y-s, all over the world. I always loved how Madonna would disappear for a few years and then come back as a totally different person; she always sounded so different, acted different and of course, she looked completely unique. Some say that Madonna cannot act; I tend to disagree. The most difficult, challenging and intricate role she has ever played was \\"Madonna.\\" Who knows, maybe she had Dissociative Identity Disorder...?     Out of all of the incarnations that Queen-Madonna possessed (or should I say possessed Queen-Madonna?) I prefer the relatively short-lived \\"American Life\\" phase. During this \\"era\\" (Winter-Spring '03,) Madonna was the catalyst. She talked about nuclear testing and was very interested in the peace-effort. With her jet-black hair, form-fitting military fatigues and now-trademark \\"American Life\\" beret, Madonna resembled a fighter who was out to \\"change the world\\" so to speak.     If you're unfamiliar with Madonna's impressive musical resume and do not know where to start, look no further, because you are home with \\"American Life.\\" This is truly Madonna's best record in years. Because (maybe for the first time?) she wasn't just playing a part. Yes, I know she got all dressed up for the cameras. But her music and lyrics were so real and fundamental. She revealed so much of herself on this CD.     Of course, I love the title-track, lead-single and most controversial song on this album, \\"American Life.\\" Madonna sings about all the clichés that society thinks about her, but she is nothing more than the \\"American dream.\\" In staccato, she even raps for us. You might remember Madonna had the music-video pulled before it even débuted within the US. This was one of the only times in Madonna's 20+ year career where she publicly showed a sense of contriteness and humility.     \\"Mother & Father,\\" \\"Hollywood,\\" and \\"X-Static Process\\" are three first-rate songs that I also especially enjoyed. On these songs alone, Madonna brings the listener into her lone world. You will be able to look inside Madonna's intricate mind and actually see what makes her tick. You don't have to like what you see, and you don't even have to respect her; but you can't deny that she was (is?) a bona fide, unabashed iconoclast.     My favorite track on this CD and one of (if not my favorite song, ever) is \\"Nobody Knows Me.\\" It is pure artistic poetry. And, I was always disappointed that \\"Nobody Knows Me\\" didn't come out as a full single. Like a cat holding onto her last breath, Madonna starts this song out by singing, \\"I've had so many lives.\\" She goes on to tell us that she isn't \\"that kind of guy.\\" Nope. The real Madonna is shy and introverted. She may have once sung about \\"expressing yourself,\\" and telling him where to stick it, but in the end Madonna's just a shy housewife that's content on standing behind her man. (Incidentally, does anyone else believe that Madonna was once a g-a-y man in a past life?) Madonna also sings about a \\"social disease.\\" This phrase is so funny, because there was once a time that \\"social disease\\" was a euphemism for HIV/AIDS (when society was too bigoted to actually talk about this ;) and everyone knows how Madonna was always such a teacher as far as AIDS-prevention/education was concerned. On second thought though, maybe Madonna's social disease isn't sexual? Instead it is more deep-rooted. The \\"social disease\\" that she is singing about is personal intimacy. The day this album came out, I went to a release party in celebration of Madonna's latest work in Greenwich Village. But Madonna took off early. Like Greta Garbo, Madonna just wants to be let alone; maybe that's why nobody knows her?
B000P0I4O4|5.0|I clearly understand where the detractors are coming from.  They did not have the patience (or the initiative to fast forward) through the first few bits where one gets the impression that John Cusack is a dim-witted loser.  I was cursing him myself, which in retrospect is a testimonial to his acting ability.<br /><br />As a former Marine Corps infrantry officer and clandestine spy who likes to tune out with DVDs, I give this movie my highest rating.<br /><br />The first few sets are indeed boring and annoying, but they are setting the stage for \\"loser makes good.\\"<br /><br />This is an uplifting film about a father connects with his son, a wimp who becomes a lion, a teacher who meets love in the forest, I could go one, but I will not.<br /><br />Buy or rent this film and be patient (or fast forward).

B000VLE3IS|5.0|I had to review this timeless work, a true master piece and a sheer genius work of art in music and sound reproduction! After reading some really aweful reviews and seeing that such a Great work is not getting its proper appreciation, I had to say something. This is such a huge leap in the advancement of sound remastering, that you would have to be absolutely deaf to not to realise it and appreciate it! These two CDs are like the masters of all masters. The GOLD CDs of all GOLD CDs. The difference is like Day and Night! My four year old could spot the diffs. I am really sorry for those people, who don't recognize it and value its true merits. I suggest you guys please get your Ears cleaned and checked! A thorough exam should be in order!       Let me tell you how huge this reincarnation is: For the first time we (rare breed of course) the audiophile and/or true Zep fans alike, who don't listen to LED ZEPPELIN only on their mediocre iPod or from the downloaded crappy no quality MP3s, can enjoy or relive the true experience of this everlasting Sonic Phenomenon AKA. LED Zeppelin! Now you can represent this music to your offspring and the upcoming generations and prove that you were not crazy all these years when you loved and endeared a band not like any other bands in the history of Rock and Roll.        Every song in these two CDs is so vivid and vibrant that you get goosebumps for every note played and every sound reproduced. I could not believe my ears! It was like listening to the LED Zeppelin in your own studio while they recording the songs just for you and you are listening them LIVE and for the first time and falling in love with the music and the sweet sound and the melody of every note played, all over again! For years I thought that I could only hear that kind of sound in my Record Player. Yes, I am one of the rare breeds who still owns a record player and collected every vinyls ever produced by the Led Zeppelin. CDs were supposed to bring more Dynamic Range and realism to the sound and the music but what we had all these years are the washed down version of Super Genius work of art. I could not stand the CDs that were released. However, that did not stop me from buying the CDs. I bought every release hoping someday it will come out right. Well my patience finally paid off thanks to everybody who worked on this project and has made the band immortal for all the generations to come.       This compilation is to all the Audiophile's dream come true and prayers fulfilled, as some other reviewer said a true GODSEND indeed! Normally you would pay Ten or Twenty times more to get this kind of recording and remastering. If you are a true fan and audiophile you will definitely buy this set. If you are just another cheap downloader or iPod listener you will just utter non-sense to justify that you are right and everybody else is wrong. Well, let me tell you something. \\"Grapes are always sour\\" to those who never had them or can't have them.
0143038419|4.0|Although this author is a good 25 younger than me, I truly enjoyed this book.  I had seen the author interviewed, which may have helped, but I was also charmed by her unaffected tone. I have to admit I find anyone who blithely admits to meditating for an uninterrupted hour suspect--but at the least this author gets you thinking about the state of your own life, and there's nothing wrong with that.

1401302378|2.0|My son's teacher suggested I purchase this book for him as my son, Mason, loves to read. Well, to be honest, I think that it is way above his level.     First, it was my understanding that [[ASIN:0738835048 The Adventures of Long Tail]] was about a family of cats named Long Tail, Boots, and Biscuit. I don't know if Mr. Anderson ever gets  around to even mentioning these cats because after chapter 3, Mason and his sister Emma gave up on reading this.     What's worse is just this past weekend, I asked my kids if they wanted to go see Bee Movie with their cousins, Skyler and Hannah, and Mason clucked his tongue and said that I was just another product of common culture. After painting his back porch red for the sassmouth, I asked him where he learned this garbage and he said the tail book.

B000WQ9UA8|5.0|With the media and press constantly following her and having her appear on the front page of every newspaper and magazine, it's no surprise Britney was going to choose now to come out with a new album. The biggest shocker is, after losing custody of her children, giving the most horrible performance of her career on the MTV Awards, and getting a divorce, her CD is one of the best albums of the year in my opinion.    The album kicks off with the smash hit and possibly the best song she's ever created \\"Gimme More\\". Sliding into the next tracks smoother than a baby's behind, Brit showcases a new side to her with a new \\"techno-pop\\" sound on \\"Piece of Me\\". This song mocks the media and press who constantly decide to give her slack for every move she makes. I love the lyrics. The albums best track (\\"Radar\\") not only shows off how good the producers are, but also the eagerness and fun in her voice as she wails out \\"Wonder if you know you're on my radar, on my radar!\\" on the chorus that you cannot help but sing a long to. The album continues with a similar sound (that does not get old) until it reaches \\"Perfect Lover\\". Many reviews of this song aren't too good, but I love this song to death. It's very mysterious and sexy which do the album justice. She ends her rollercoaster ride of an album with a song I constantly put on repeat \\"Why Should I Be Sad\\"; a callout to Kevin. She puts Kevin on blast telling him all of the wrongs he's done to her and their relationship yet repeats \\"Why should I be sad? Heaven knows, from the stupid freakin' things that you do.\\" Giving the audience a set mind that their relationship is over. For a bad year, Brit makes up for it with this CD. It's a must buy.
0060558121|3.0|Having heard about this book for years, I was ready to be blown away. But I found the book good, not great. The premise is wonderful, and the writing is good---not flashy but smooth and effective. The book's greatest weakness was the episodic plot: a road-trip that lasts 3/4 of the novel and is fairly repetitive. I appreciated the ending, though: very thoughtful and appropriate and yet also surprising.
B000H6SXMY|5.0|I bought this for my girlfriend last year and it was definately worth it! She has watched the whole series like 3 times! For the price, you will definately get your use out of it! The shipping was fast and the product was exactly as described! Amazon had the cheapest price around at that time.
B000WQ9UA8|5.0|This is a really good dance CD. Sure, some of the songs are \\"naughty\\" and sure, Britney has a ton of not-so-personal problems, but this CD isn't bad at all. I can't think of a song on it that I don't really like for one reason or another. I was hoping that the release of this album would help her straighten up a bit, but I think that's not going to happen.    Songs I personally highlighted:  Radar (it's so dang catchy, and I like it.)  Heaven on Earth (Again, I like it- no concrete reason, the cutesy chorus?)  Hot as Ice (Excellent. 'Nough said.)    Yes, it seems you can't really hear \\"her\\" voice due to production, but the effects are actually cool, and the beats are undeniably good. Coming from someone who desparately wanted Britney to go away early in her career, I've managed to over look her craziness and see that she (or her people) can make good, poppy, dance music.

B0002F6BRE|5.0|This is a great Christmas movie for all ages! Will Ferrel is wonderful and hilarious. I especially love the animation at the North Pole; puffin, narwhale, sno-man, and the animated titles. Bob Newhart as Papa Elf is goofy great! Love the ending, so beautiful. Brilliant from start to finish!
B000X1Z0BU|5.0|This is without question the best film of 2007. Glen and Marketa put on amazing performances...especially considering they are musicians, not professional actors. It's a beautiful love story that is simple on the surface, but has many deep layers.  I fell in love with this film last summer and cannot wait for the DVD release. Seeing Glen and Marketa in concert only made the experience and my love for this film that much sweeter.
B000E0WJIC|1.0|\\"Bullet for my Valentine?\\" I thought to myself as I read an article on them in Revolver Magazine, \\"What a horrible name!\\"  An obvious rip off of Guns N' Roses who they have toured with (not the cool lineup just so you know the Gun's featuring a washed up overweight axl rose who can't deal with the fact that the whole world is completely over his shenanigans and other people who i have no idea who they are).  But for some stupid reason I kept on reading and read that the lead singer said \\"we aren't into the whole punk thing\\" to which i thought \\"hey i'm not into the whole punk thing either!  Then he went on to say how they were into the Testament and Pantera back catalogs and again I thought \\"Hey! I like Testament and Pantera too!, maybe these guys are a really cool band with just a horrible name!\\"  So then i went and bought the piece of garbage and realized that I had been duped!  Last time I checked lyrics like \\"where is my angel i need her now\\" or \\"would she hold me if she knew my pain\\" wouldn't even come close to finding there way onto any Testament or Pantera cd or any real metal cd for that matter.  To sum it up if you like emoish metal/mallcore with riffs that do absolutely nothing for you and with lyrics so sappy the backstreet boys would probably pass on them more power to you!  I'll be too busy listening to my Demiricous cd's to care!

I loved the \\"Star Wars\\" method of showing you the pre conditions to cancelling a policy,,,,like everything known to man.<br /><br />Being a Canadian with Universal Health Care I was shocked that HMO has such power as to refuse a patient and send them away without treatment.<br /><br />I found it very interesting that France, Britain, and Sweden had such outstanding programs.<br /><br />Found the staging one sided but to give Moore credit...the issues he brought to the front are very serious indeed.  With the Insurance companies having a strong strangle hold on the system...it is very frightening.<br /><br />We in Canada do not have a perfect system what with longer waiting times to see a specialist, longer time to get the needed operations, the starting of some private clinics that will do you work for a fee.  Some new Doctor's are opting out of family practise and choosing to work in shared Clinics and Hospitals to avoid costly overhead.  However even with these problems we still have outstanding Health Care in Canada.<br /><br />Would have enjoyed seeing suggestions on how to improve the US system.  With extremely powerful lobbyists coupled with other self interest groups it is an extremely difficult problem to solve.

B000YMBBH0|5.0|It's lame the way Universal is treating this trilogy.  Sure, DVD owners get an official box set, but not us HD buyers? weaksauce.  Still, the movies are great, probably the greatest spy films since 007.  There's not a weakpoint in the trilogy, and I loved the way it ended; a coda to the way it began, underwater.  Damon is pretty convincing, doing a lot of his own stunts so you can see his face close-up during chase scenes.  I also like the implied former romance with Julia Styles hinted at in Ultimatum.  If you like intense action and intelligent storylines, pick up these thrillers, as they're even better than most of the books.
B00006JDSI|5.0|This DVD is a fine product. The quality of the film print is good, and it offers two modern soundtracks to choose from. Before watching the film, I was hesitant about the soundtracks. But I quickly found that the music works extremely well with the film. I highly recommend it.
1582701709|2.0|Take a basic principle, The Law of Attraction, which teaches you how to use your thoughts and feelings to get what you want in life.  Sprinkle in a lot of hype and divorce it from deeper spiritual values and principles and you pretty much have THE SECRET. Fact is, it is no secret that people attract what they want; the key is to want the right things for the right reasons! Knowing WHAT TO WISH FOR, not merely how to wish is why I wrote my own book this year, [[ASIN:1571745564 Beyond the Secret]]<br /><br />Here are a few of the 20 different points of disagreement I had with this book that I addressed in my own.<br /><br />\\"You are the most powerful magnet in the Universe.\\" - The Secret.<br />\\"Who are 'you?' Who is the 'you' that is doing the attracting?  Your spiritual self?  Your ego?  How can you distinquish between the two?\\" - [[ASIN:1571745564 Beyond the Secret]]<br /><br />\\"Only do what feels good.\\"  - The Secret<br />\\"Attempt to do what feels right.  Feel good by doing good.\\" - [[ASIN:1571745564 Beyond the Secret]]<br /><br />\\"You cannot catch any illness unless you think you can.\\" - The Secret<br />\\"Even the most spiritual people amongst us may suffer from disease.  The causes for disease are numerous and not always a result of your thoughts.\\" - [[ASIN:1571745564 Beyond the Secret]]<br /><br />\\"We never run out of good things because there's more than enough to go around for everyone.\\" - The Secret<br />\\"There is enough for our needs, but not our greeds.  Global warming is a problem right now precisely because as a species we are over-consuming. Remember the ego is afraid of not getting what it wants. When we are truly identified with Spirit we want everyone to have enough, not just ourselves.\\" - [[ASIN:1571745564 Beyond the Secret]]<br /><br />Look the Law of Attraction is neutral.  It doesn't care what kind of person you are, when you let the genie out of the bottle to make a wish.  That is why I emphasize that the Law of Attraction is not just about \\"getting and spending\\"; that if wedded with deeper spiritual principles it can be understood as a tool for developing an authentic spirituality that leads us from a focus on consumption to one of contribution, or feeling that we are primarily here to make a positive difference in our world.<br /><br />After all, if we as a human family don't make a more concerted effort to attract \\"spiritual abundance\\" over \\"material abundance\\" we may attract a lot of stuff to ourselves, but we won't create a world we really want to live in.  That is why I believe it is time to move WAY \\"beyond\\" The Secret, and to put the horse before the cart so we can orient towards spirit, negate our egos, and attract soul qualities that will help us become better people, so we know what to attract that can be of benefit to ourselves and everyone around us. The Secret says practically nothing about this. Which is why I don't think the Law of Attraction is the \\"greatest secret of the universe\\" as this book hypes it to be. I think learning the secret of Spirit is so we become loving and caring individuals capable of attracting and creating a better world. - Dr. Lisa Love, [[ASIN:1571745564 Beyond the Secret]]s it can be understood as a tool for developing an authentic spirituality that leads us from a focus on consumption to one of contribution, or feeling that we are primarily here to make a positive difference in our world.

B000000XB9|5.0|This has to be one of the greatest greatest hits albums around.  Creedence Clearwater Revival (hereafter, CCR) was a top band on its time, and this CD does a terrific job of showing the listener why.  If you didn't know of this group before, this CD explains why they were so well received in their era.<br /><br />John Fogerty, lead vocal and lead guitar, was a key motive force for the group.  His unique voice is displayed well here.<br /><br />Some classic cuts:<br /><br />\\"Susie Q\\" is a rock classic.  CCR does a nice job here.  They show off the classic CCR sound.  No fancy guitar work, but effective nonetheless.  Fogerty's voice captures the spirit of this song well.  In addition, some interesting vocal effects.<br /><br />\\"Proud Mary\\" is one of their absolute best works.  Many may know it from Tina Turner's version, which is itself a classic.  CCR's version is also classic. The start of the song is probably one of the best (and best known) introductions  in rock and roll. \\"Rollin' on a river\\" is one of the most recognized tag lines, I would guess. As already noted, guitar work and instrumentals generally are basic but quite effective.<br /><br />\\"Bad Moon Rising\\" is a rollicking song. \\"I see a bad moon rising; I see trouble on the way.\\"  One of my favorite CCR pieces.<br /><br />\\"Down on the Corner.\\" I can never get \\"Willie and the poor boys\\" out of my mind!  This is straightforward, unprettified rock and roll.  As liner notes mention, CCR went against the grain of psychedelic music, current at a portion of their period of work.  This song well exemplifies their body of work.<br /><br />And then there is \\"I Heard It through the Grapevine.\\"  This was a Temptations' song, and their version is stunning and one of the great moments in the genre.  But CCR takes this and makes it their own, too. The instrumental work is well done and Fogerty's voice works well on the lyrics.<br /><br />So, what's the bottom line?  One of the classic compilations of a group's work.  You want to know about CCR?  There isn't a better way than to listen to this work.n to this work.

Although I will state that this is just one look at Islam.  I agree with Ayaan's thoughts and feelings on her outlook on life based on what she went through, I'd now like to read the Koran and form my own opinion.

Even though it's obvious these are Petes situations in the main Roger is ,has and always will be a wonderful vehicle for Pete to articulate his thoughts,hopes and on more than one occasion frustrations on the world and those who live in it. After all that, a wonderful record then and an equally good CD now.
0060557818|4.0|For some reason, I had thought that \\"Neverwhere\\" would be a dark novel.  There are several dark elements, but the tone of the novel isn't dark (though it is often darkly comedic).<br /><br />Overall, I found it to be faster paced than Gaiman's \\"Stardust\\" and as enjoyable as Gaiman's \\"Anansi Boys.\\"<br /><br />\\"Neverwhere\\" (like \\"Stardust\\" and \\"Anansi Boys\\") features a hapless, likable hero on a quest to escape a world that is both more dark and more whimsical than the ordinary life he knew before he fell through the cracks in the world.<br /><br />The hero of \\"Neverwhere\\" is a bored worker bee named Richard Mayhew who could easily fit into the world of tv's \\"The Office\\" before almost literally stumbling across a wounded girl.  The girl begs for his help, and that's where Richard's trouble begins.  Before he knows it, Richard has lost his job, his fiance, his apartment, and quite possibly his mind.<br /><br />Has Richard gone crazy?  Even he isn't 100% sure.  Perhaps he's become one of the homeless, haunted by delusions and talking to himself.  Or perhaps he truly has fallen into an unseen world of magic, killers, monsters, witches, and angels that exists above, below, and through the shadows and cracks of London.<br /><br />This is a modern fantasy/adventure with sparkling wit and enough darkness to keep it interesting.  Overall, it was a fun, enjoyable read.

B000Y44LBG|5.0|First off this is a great film and well worth seeing at the big screen.  The acting was good and the period feel was well done.  Enough said.<br /><br />I don't like to rehash plot or write spoilers, so here's why this is a must see film:<br /><br />It clearly shows why the America war on drugs is a losing battle and fraught with evils greater than the disease.  Much like the movie Traffic showed (and Blow, Scar Face, etc.) the drug world is ugly and it's not going away not matter what governments do; in fact, governments usually just make things worse.<br /><br />The Russell Crow character points out in the film (okay a bit of a spoiler here) that maybe the government really doesn't want to eradicate drugs; too many jobs are at stake.<br /><br />Sure things aren't so bad in the police department as they were in the 1970's, crime is down, two thirds of drug enforcement cops aren't on the take like they were in New York during the period of the film, however I live in Orange County California and the top sheriff just got indicted by the feds.  Power and money still corrupt even in the twenty first century, even in white professional (O.C. Housewives) Christian, family values Orange County.<br /><br /> I'm not saying all cops are bad, and as the movie shows, some are truly professionals; but when you have a group of people whose job consists of trying to run other peoples lives and dictate how those people can treat their own bodies mixed with another group of people that believe in free enterprise (well actually they probably like the profits created by the black markets, but lets pretend thugs like Frank Lukas are entrepreneurs) and a group of people that really want said product, and now mix in guns, the fight for control of markets in an illegal market, prisons, addicts, etc.; well it's no surprise that we get violence and death.  And this movie does a darn good job of showing a real life example of it all.<br /><br />I give this movie a strong recommendation; I believe all who support our losing fight in the war on drugs ought to see the movie twice.war on drugs ought to see the movie twice.
B0006L0LOS|5.0|Okay, it took me a LOOOONNNGGGG LONNNNGGG time to really be able to see this movie without being biased (because i'm a huge catwoman fan) towards it. But every time it's come on t.v. I would find myself watching it. I decided to actually go to Best Buy to Buy it, that's how much i wanted to see it. Great storyline (they should have just called her Selina Kyle though, I don't know WHY THEY didn't call her that.) But yeah great movie. I would have liked to see on the dvd sketches for the costume, Halle practicing using the whip or cracking it. Maybe some concept designs on what didn't get shot but was on the drawing boards. If Catwoman were not In BAtman Returns and ont the animated series, this movie probably could have been seen by itself but everyone had their idea of what it should have been and that's why people say it's not a good movie. But I bet everyone like myself watches it.         Now, my opinion on why it didn't work.     Costume  When I, like everyone else saw it first I absolutely was pissed off at whoever made it the way it was. I remember even before the movie came out everyone was pissed at the costume and i know by how Halle looked in interviews she knew it was bogus to. I mean come on CSI has been on for a while so common sense of viewers would be to know you can't be half naked b/c you'll leave evidence (DNA, blood if you get stabbed, fingerprints, etc). Not only was the exposed skin a problem but the glittered gloves was dumb and I like a lot of people HATED THE MASK. It was toooooo tall. I mean the ears were all the way up there. Bogus. And the opened toed shoes was dumb too. REallly dumb. I BET if she had a cooler costume it would have worked out better in sales/box office.    2. Storyline    Okay Catwoman has always been a major thief so they really should have made her want to steal things more. If they were getting pressure from the Parental control (whoever does ratings of movies, then i see why they should have avoided it, but the plotline could have been Catwoman steals from the rich snobby elite clique of clients that have invested in this guy stealing exotic cats (lions, tigers, etc) from jungles and zoos and putting them on display at his own personal mansion. Not only that but later it's revealed some of the investing clients (rich snobs, women, men etc) want to get the cats furs made into coats (sorta like Dalmations movie). That would justify the theft from CAtwoman. Steal from the evil people.     Totally dissed the fanbase    In these kinds of movies with HUGE fanbases, it's a pretty dummmmbbbb BUSINESS MOVE (if you're looking at just for the money)  to take a name, movie, concept and then make a completely different movie with it. That's what they did and it was a dumb move. The fans are the ones that pump in the money to knock the movie into the #1 spot on the box office. They're the ones that see the movie three and four times. (I saw the first X-men movie 3 times even though I wasn't as impressed, but it stayed a little more truer to the comics as far as powers concepts, etc). We're also the ones that help with the DVD sales. So, the creators totally pissed on the fans. Well let me be nice about it. Okay, Catwoman can be compared to vampire movies. Now vampire movies have been done SOOOO MANY TIMES that you can deviate from the classic great vampire movies, because you have to set yourself apart if you wanna get a pat on the shoulder. It's only necessary if you want a medal or soemthing, other thann that you can still do a basic vampire movie. The ones that keep truesst to a vampire (having teeth, and drinking blood are usually the requirements for it to do well)   now the problem with this movie is that Catwoman hasn't been done enough times to deviate from the known concept. It would have been different if Michelle Pheifer had done that solo movie (she had a baby i think that's why she dropped out). Or if there were a Catwoman t.v. show, but there hasn't been enough on it, that's whyfans were pissed at this movie.   I NEVER THOUGHT race was an issue with this b/c one Eartha Kitt was CAtwoman and she did a phenomenal job. Besides with only the hairpiece/ears being different she was basically playing the same role. So that's not an issue. I truly was envisioning Halle with the long hair (like in the first part of the movie) in the purple costume. I would have believed and I would have loved it.    Halle I think did say if they revamped it (probably meaning did it like the comics, be more truer to it, like Storm in part 3 of X-men) then she'd do it, and I hope she would. AS a promo someone needs to have a mannequin dressed in the purple outfit to show what could have been. it still can do really well. I think that bootleg independent movie is doing rather well. Though i hate the spandex purple. They should use jogging pants material. it's thicker and more believable.

The characters are colorful and the terror of ancient Japan is brought to life by the author.<br /><br />My problem with the novel is the ending is sudden, anti-climatic, and left me wondering if I missed something.<br /><br />Still, this is a great novel and a worthy read.
B000OLGCI4|3.0|Now before you die hards spew fire at me for giving this movie three stars let me explain myself. Three stars says you like the movie, but at the same time your not in love with it. That explains my position perfectly. This is a charming movie that I thoroughly enjoyed as a child, and by all means it is superior to most films that are made for children today. My main issue is that I don't feel it is as strong as other classic movies from the Disney vault. It just doesn't compare to a Snow White, Peter Pan, Bambi, Lady And The Tramp, or Mary Poppins. It is good to note that this is a solid childrens film that the whole family can enjoy. However, I always hold Disney films under a more critical lense. Disney themselves set the standard for childrens films, so they should be judged by the standards they set forth. Jungle Book is a solid movie I am proud to own.

Plus, a lot more videos than what is here were recently available a few year ago on the dvd set. As far as the best rock band ever, get off the drugs, you're a little too old for that anymore. MAYBE after the Beatles, Rolling Stones, Pink Floyd, Black Sabbath and The Who;  MAYBE! Each of these groups is more influential, more original and had members who went on to very successful solo careers or continued putting out great music past 1979(Zeps last album) after the core years passed. If they're so wonderful, what have they done since '79? The next time Plant does a classic rock song as Robert Plant will be his first time. Jimmy Page did the soundtrack to Death Wish 2! I guess Page could only steal so many riffs from old black blues guitarists that the well has run dry. Besides the plagiarizing he's known for, there are other Zep songs that were never challenged. Check out \\"Boogie with Stu\\" from Physical Graffitti. Compare it to a Richie Valens song from 1958 called \\"Ooh my Head\\". Don't buy this crap. If you must, wait for the individual remasters.
0099422697|4.0|A tough read.  Kepesh is a likable figure, but one that gets lost in his own mind.  This book is reminiscent of Banville's, \\"The Sea\\" in that finished it but felt like I immediately needed to re-start in order to understand what I just went through.<br /><br />All-in-all, a quick, good read. Another brilliant description by Roth of what makes humans tick.  If you ever find yourself re-evaluating choices in life, read this to make you feel better.
B000W1V44I|4.0|this is the best cd that they had made so far. if you are a bsb fan, then you will have to get it. trouble is, in pieces, love will keep you up all night, inconsolable, something that i already know is the best songs that they had made. what ever they did this make this one they should use on the next one. they still have songs on there that is still the old them like downpour, unssupecting sunday afternoon, and panic. but over i will get this cd a \\"B\\". i really like this cd. Keep up the good work.
0765357151|5.0|...at least based on scripts I've seen, the trailers, and the previous film versions (Charlton Heston in The Omega Man and Vincent Price in The Last Man on Earth.)  Both took the story and made the vampires into, well, something else--diseased zombies.  It LOOKS like the new Will Smith movie does the same, but we'll see.<br />Anyway, the most important aspect of this book hasn't been touched on by the dozen or so reviews I've read here, so I thought I'd comment.  That aspect is the idea of how we define the \\"other.\\"  The hatred Robert Neville holds for the vampire population and how we \\"root\\" for him because he's \\"like us\\" is remarkable, and turned on its head by the end of the novel.<br />Speaking of the end--if the movie ends like the early drafts of the script, I, for one, will be sorely disappointed.  I won't comment further (to give it away) but the \\"new\\" ending doesn't allow Neville to come to the realization in the title...

B000EHSVQ4|5.0|I loved \\"The Kingdom of Heaven\\" as shown in the theater.  But I was blown away by the director's cut.  It isn't just the theater version padded by a few deleted scenes.  Whole sections of story line were cut from the film before it was placed in the theaters.  The director's cut restores these and completes an already great film.  Without these deleted scenes, the behavior of some of the principal characters doesn't make as much sense.  Makes me wonder how much sense was applied by the studio execs who ordered the scenes cut.  If you liked this movie at all, or if you missed it the first time around and are curious, please be sure to see this version.  It is wonderful.    I do have to caution that, although many of the characters were real people, significant liberties were taken with historical fact.  After you see the movie, you can look up the history of the fall of Jerusalem and see for yourself.  This time period was very interesting in the factual form, yet also very entertaining and moving as portrayed on screen, even if not entirely accurate.
B000VI70WM|1.0|Boy, what a letdown this is. \\"Astronaut\\" may not have been perfect, but it's a masterpiece compared to this trendy mess. Only \\"Falling Down\\" is touted on the cover sticker, and for good reason; it's the only really good track here. This is so lacking in what made \\"Astronaut\\" so good; namely, melodies, harmonies, and actual songs, as opposed to the hip-hop-trip-hop-whatever this is. The drums sound totally programmed, so Roger may as well have left the band along with Andy. Was he used at all? I'm really aghast at how much this album is a total sellout. Simon claims that Timerlake was a \\"fan\\" of the band, but I don't believe that at all. He was brought into this because he is the current teen sensation, like Duran was back in the '80s, and they probably thought if they get together, his fans would follow into this project. Yes, \\"sell out\\" is the operative phrase here. I do rather like \\"Falling Down\\"; at least it's a song. Simon said the whole point was to get back in the charts, but alas they have failed. \\"Falling Down\\" did not do the trick, and RCM peaked in the low 30s and quickly tanked. Back to the drawing board guys. Next time, don't try to appeal to today's teenagers, OK? They are not interested anyway.
B000H305U0|4.0|Even though most of singles are great, his songs on the album see like mindless club beats that seem to focus more on music beats than actual content such as with \\"LoveStoned\\" and \\"Summer Love\\".  \\"Losing My Way\\" & \\"(Another Song) All Over Again\\" has its moments but you are more drawn to the beats than his lyrics, I'm not sure if its due to the production.  If you are looking for anything lyrically deep forget about this album.  This is mainly a mellow R&B club disc and not a dance album because the weight of the R&B beats takes away the electric dance energy found in more pop-oriented songs of the '80s and late '90s (i.e. I Want You Back).    With Justin's release of FutureSex/LoveSounds, there's no question that his singles are remarkable.  \\"SexyBack\\", \\"My Love\\", \\"LoveStoned\\", \\"What Goes Around...\\" & \\"Summer Love\\" mostly contain the heavy bass beat of hip-hop, but has electronica elements that make it more pop/dance friendly compared to the gritty rap & hip-hop music of the 90s    Despite these super hot singles, his producing talent is still questionable because at least 85% of both of his solo albums are produced by Timbaland and Nanja, and you wonder what his musical style would be like without them.  (Maybe it explains why so many songs sound so similiar.  In case you are wondering, artists' songs on an album usually use the same producer in at most 40% of their albums.)    I would suggest just downloading/buying the singles, rather than purchasing the album.  Justin may have had some great hits, but he seems rather too timid to break out of the \\"go with the music scene\\" flow by choosing a safe formulatic process of creating a pop-oriented spin to the popular \\"hip-hop\\" sounds of today.  He may be a great artist, but his music personality seems covered by the \\"safe route\\", slick production of Timbaland and not taking any musical risks like Christina Aguilera (i.e. Ain't No Other Man, choosing a swing song), Fergie (i.e. Big Girls Don't Cry, choosing a pop ballad), Rihanna (i.e. Shut Up and Drive, breaking away from her Reggae genre), Britney Spears (i.e. Gimme More, working with Nanja for the 1st time), and Pink (her profound genre change from hip-hop of her 1st album to rock in her subsequent albums).    It's kind of ironic that Justin uses the heavy bass of hip-hop, but his voice is still as high as a pre-pubesent teen.  (Sorry but songs like \\"My Love\\" remind me of his 'N Sync days.)  Too bad there isn't a male artist that has a Barry White or Luther Vandross voice for today's popular music.
B000VSBX34|4.0|Having been a Beatles fan for many years, I have enjoyed all of the Beatles movies, and Help! is no exception. The restoration of the movie itself seems to be top notch (watch the behind the scenes of how they did some of the restoration of the film master, lots of painstaking work behind it!!). I am not giving it the 5 stars it so rightfully deserves because of the audio soundtrack, particularly when the Beatles break into song. This remastered Help! comes only in either 5.1 DTS (Digital Theater Sound), or 2-channel PCM stereo. Most home theater systems have Dolby Digital 5.1 instead of DTS 5.1, which doesn't make sense why this movie wasn't remastered in Dolby 5.1. The music is loud when the Beatles break into song, and I find myself turning down the sound for the songs, then turning up the audio again to hear the regular dialog from the movie. I used to have the MPI release of Help!, and while the picture wasn't quite the same as this version, at least the musical soundtrack was in Dolby 5.1, and wasn't hard on the ears between songs and movie dialog. I did like watching the second disc of interviews, restoration of the movie, etc. (great to see what Eleanor Bron looks like today versus 1965). Again, 4 stars, great picture restoration, questionable audio sound and no Dolby 5.1
0152048049|5.0|SPOILER WARNING! This review reveals the end of the story.<br /><br />This is one of my favourite books but its popularity puzzles me because I've always felt The Little Prince dealt with the dark side of life, and that it might tempt us with the lure of an easy exit.<br /><br />This is a tale in which a child commits suicide. Period. It's no good insisting that Saint-Ex's story offers life lessons, or that it is a metaphor for wanting to go home. This might well be true, but it's at bottom still the story of a little boy whose heart is broken by a difficult relationship who chooses to end his suffering by killing himself with a snake bite.<br /><br />I believe the book is Saint-Ex's suicide note. Saint-Ex considered suicide unmanly and base. Man must fight on and struggle with life no matter how bad it gets. He clearly states this in Wind, Sand, and Stars. Yet Saint-Ex was an unhappy difficult man stuck in difficult relationships with difficult women. Furthermore, as a French thinker he was living through the same period of existential angst that would give rise to Camus and Sartre. (Not to mention World War II! ) He cleverly trapped himself in his own rules. Men don't kill themselves, and Saint-Ex was a Man. He had to find a subtle exit and any suicide note he left had to be disguised.<br /><br />He died returning from a reconnaissance mission in an unarmed plane. Why unarmed? Why did he insist on being given these excessively dangerous missions? Pure conjecture on my part, but I think he just wanted to end it all, and he wanted to go out a hero.<br /><br />In this light, I see The Little Prince as his suicide note. A possible reason is ordinary to the point of being trite. A mere failed love affair, a turbulent romance with his wife Consuelo. The deeper reason is that like so many artists, Saint-Ex suffered and could not shake that off. But being the man's man that he was, he had to go out like a man. Not for Saint-Ex the easy exit. Not for Saint-Ex the certain exit. I suppose his plane was unarmed so that he could not go looking for a fight, as a safeguard against his engineering an easily found death. He had to come back safely for his mission to be successful, and yet the risk of being shot down was always there, the German defenses promising to end his suffering like the snake promises to send the Little Prince home to his beloved rose with a single quick bite.<br /><br />Saint-Ex himself is thus the Little Prince, but not wanting to be obvious, he makes the narrator a pilot, just as he was, so that we mistake the narrator-pilot for the author-pilot. Instead, perhaps we should see the child-prince in the author and see ourselves, the readers, in the narrator. When the Little Prince tells the narrator not to worry, that he would only seem dead but that he would really be up there in the stars, isn't this really Saint-Ex telling us that his spirit, his soul, would be there for us in his books?<br /><br />Not for children.<br /><br />Vincent Poirier, Dublinthat he could not go looking for a fight, as a safeguard against his engineering an easily found death.

B000SNUMC0|4.0|Honestly, I have only listened to the entire recording a few times.  So far, it has been enjoyable.  I am not so impressed with the whole concept, but the music (which is what really matters) is pretty good.  Ripper is better here than on the previous effort and with Beyond Fear.  There are a couple of what seem like filler songs, particularly \\"A Charge to Keep\\" and \\"Order of the Rose\\".  Kind of boring and I usually skip.  Overall, though, it seems a decent effort and I will definitely keep it in my music rotation.
031236198X|4.0|The book is a must-read for anyone involved (leaders, managers, participants, etc) in organizations and/or processes that need change (and who isn't!!).  Easy to understand and internalize, but still sufficiently profound to demand a second read.    I have already given mine away ... I might have to buy anther.
0440237688|5.0|Still it remains in my memories! I like the depth and the details, however there is really only one word I can use to describe the story, different! It's a great book because it allows you to think on your own and lets you have your own opinions while the author has hers; it's not just there for pure entertainment. This book was an easy read yet it taught me some significance to life.
0743455967|5.0|Mr. King, a name synonymous with horror fiction, as well as the writer's craft in general, presents a memoir/journal of the trade of writing that reads with his typically engaging styles. It is brief, in comparison with his other works, and is written in a personal style that flows more like a conversation than a text.     While the memoir is entertaining and engaging, the real heart of the book is in the notes on writing that occupy the middle of the work. It is not a comprehenive book on editing and style (such as Strunk & White, or assorted other books), but provides little bits of advice that have provided me with more motivation and guidance than most of the other books that I have read on the art of writing.     King is not only a gifted storyteller, and engaging writer, but a plain-spoken teacher who's trials in the realm of writing should be enough to encourage most students of the art to aspire to greater ability and renown. In the library of a man who is known as one of our century's most prolific writers, this is a rare and precious gem of knowledge, from one who has gone before. Mr. King reminds us that writing is first and foremost fun, and a journey that never really ends.
B000LAZDQA|4.0|This was an interesting movie.  It is definitely for adult 18 and older but what makes the movie good is the following:<br />1 - sex scenes were not restricted and provide some surprises when watching<br />2 - The actor had to be good to do some of things in the movie which I think anyone will find interesting regardless of gender<br />3 - I looked at this as neither straight nor gay in turn of a movie.  It concentrated on everyone's issues.  I happen to be turning the channel one day and saw this on logo.  I almost didn't watch this the first time I saw it because I thought it was a gay movie.  Much to my surprise.<br />3 - In the end I wasn't sure I got what the real issue was other than everyone has problem within.  Maybe I need to watch it again to see if I get something else out of it.<br />4 -  Overall this really is a interesting movie.<br />5 -  Watch it.
B000N6TYLW|5.0|Although, I had heard that the 7th season wasn't great, OF COURSE PEOPLE ARE GOING TO SAY THAT! It was the last season of an amazing show!     I on the other hand loved it and thought they did a great job wrapping everything up!

B000LPQ6DE|5.0|Anyone going into a film/tv adaptation of a book should never expect it to be 100% true to the book.  You will always be disappointed.  There are just some things which you cannot adapt to the screen.      I cannot praise this adaptation highly enough.  In fact, I cannot stop thinking about it.  I watched it yesterday.  The atmosphere, emotions and passions, portrayed by outstanding actors, is truly remarkable.  The central plot, the relationship between Rochester and Jane, is wonderfully portrayed.      Of course some of the sections in the book are not included, but come on!  This is an amazing book made into an amazing tv 'adaptation'.  All you Jane Eyre purists will never be happy!
B000RW3YYA|4.0|I read quite a few of the other reviews (but not all, so I apologize if this has been brought up already).  I love the show (see my other reviews) and truly thought that Season 3 was great fun.  Really, the only reason I gave this 4 stars instead of 5 is that the the DVD cases and the inserts were disappointing.  Maybe it was just an error for my discs alone.  I know that they are not knock offs because I bought directly from Amazon, but the cases from Seasons 1 & 2 were much better quality and the inserts had some of the episode info on the inside of the covers.  This time around, it's just printed on the outside with the usual action shots, and no info on the inside.  Just white, blank paper.    I don't mean to be picky, -- the show is the best, most enjoyable, scifi out there and actually, this was one of only two complaints.  Maybe they were saving money for making the SG-1 movies, who knows (lol).    My other complaint was that every single commentary was from background people (they are the ones who make it all happen, but I personally thought that prior seasons' commentaries were more entertaining).  I don't remember hearing one commentary from any of the actors.  I enjoy hearing what happened on the set during filming from the actors' POV some of the time.    My fav episodes were \\"The Tao of Rodney\\", and \\"Sunday\\" (even though it was so sad).  These complaints are small and definitely won't keep me from watching this season over, and over again.  I still recommend that you buy it and know that you will enjoy it.
0066620996|4.0|Good book with lots of good info, but a little hard to follow.  This book has to be read from cover to cover to understand even small portions of it.
0060890096|5.0|A friend recommended this CD to me and it was a great recommendation.  Jay Sanders does an amazing job reading this book.  He provides interpretation that goes beyond the book and makes the book seem even more ironic and entertaining.  Parts are laugh out loud funny.  He changes his voice to match various characters and really brings the characters to life.  I think his voices and interpretations for Yossarian and Milo are great.  The part of the book describing events following Orr's crash landing and the time in a life boat is truly hilarious, made more so by Mr. Sanders's retelling.  If you have read the book (which everyone should as it is a bit of genius and a great commentary on the absurdity of life) get the CD, if you have not read the book, get the CD. I think this is one of the best CD versions of a book I have ever heard.

B000YABIQ6|5.0|i couldnt have said it better than the previous reviewer.  This show is absolutely addicting and completely in the realm of almost entertainment therapy, since any adult can relate to the situations of this show. The social strata and class labels of \\"secretaries\\", \\"bosses\\" and \\"wives\\" and their assigned roles and duties is sheer brilliant drama and the frustrations of those in the classes is effectively conveyed to us.  You can see the 60's ready to explode with the liberation of all these classes and \\"free\\" the women from the men, the men from their almost god-like bosses (having to take off their shoes to enter his office like entering a temple) and the general workplace poplulation from onsite smoking and drinking and carousing.  it makes you wonder how would life today be if things were still like that, but i get the feeling that the creator's purpose is not so much to contrast, but to juxtaposition, to make you really think... did it really change?... is it really any different now?......    When this comes on DVD every adult in America will enjoy this show!
B000WCBPOG|3.0|Having been entranced by the movie and being a big Beatles fan, I was really looking forward to getting the soundtrack. Well - it wasn't as  expected, rather dissapointing really. Many songs were a different version than what was recorded and used in the movie - most notably  \\"With a little help from my friends\\". The CD has only \\"Max\\" & \\"Jude\\" singing rather than the fun, infectious version of the movie. On top of that, the CD didn't include two songs from the movie!    I waited a little longer to be able to get the two-disc special edition soundtrack and am disappointed at not getting what I really wanted. Question: if I just got the regular version, paid less & waited less, would it have been any better?

B000Y179KO|3.0|Well, after perusing several of the reviews here I see fans can't make up their minds how to feel about \\"Long Road Out Of Eden\\" (LROOE). The Eagles seem to evoke many different feelings from many different people. My take is that \\"LROOE\\" is average for The Eagles. There's nothing new here. I think \\"How Long\\" was the perfect choice for first single with its throwback to \\"Take It Easy\\". Outside of \\"How Long\\" it's slim pickin's.<br /><br />I find it easier to just list the songs that I thought were good, mediocre and weak.<br /><br />The good:<br />No More Walks In The Wood<br />How Long<br />Busy Being Fabulous<br />Waiting In The Weeds<br />Fast Company<br />Do Something<br />You Are Not Alone<br />Frail Grasp On The Big Picture<br />Last Good Time In Town<br />Business As Usual<br />Center Of The Universe<br />It's Your World Now<br /><br />Mediocre:<br />Guilty Of The Crime<br />No More Cloudy Days<br />Long Road Out Of Eden<br />I Dreamed There Was No War (which sounded completely like Vangelis's \\"Hymn\\")<br />Somebody<br /><br />Weak:<br />What Do I Do With My Heart<br />I Don't Want To Hear Any More<br />I Love To Watch A Woman Dance (THE WORST TRACK HERE!)<br /><br />I feel bored more than anything. This could have been one disc, not two. They underutilized Joe Walsh and Timothy B. Schmidt. They didn't include Randy Meisner, Don Felder or Bernie Leadon (which probably would have helped). They have nothing new to say, though some of Henley's rants are spot on, and Frey's ballads are convincing. My preference is Henley, and I wish he'd just put out solo albums on a regular basis. Fleetwood Mac did a better job four years ago in terms of making a relevant album with four of the five key members. I don't think The Eagles will make another one after this if the lyrics to \\"It's Your World Now\\" are true. My friend told me the other day that he wasn't waiting for a new Eagles cd, and the band really didn't need to end their illustrious career on \\"LROOE\\".<br /><br />Here's to the solo careers!
B000Y44LBG|4.0|\\"American Gangster\\" tells the true story of Frank Lucas(portrayed by Denzel Washington),a Harlem drug kingpin who,in 1968,began a drug operation of Southeastern Asia heroin--that pertained to the Vietnam War. The operation and what came out of it,as well as the life that Frank Lucas lived at the time and what the New Jersey and New York City police had to do,alongside the efforts of detective Ritchie Roberts(portrayed by Russell Crowe)that were made during an unmerciful period in Roberts' life,are all documented by \\"American Gangster\\".    There are several ways in which \\"American Gangster\\" could have been done. The way that was chosen? Telling the true story behind \\"American Gangster\\" in order by year,but twisting the events around. While this is a risky theory,it works pretty well. It is a theory that tells viewers the story they have come for--but makes them think and put pieces of the puzzle together while acquiring the film's information. While \\"American Gangster\\" would have had more life to it and stood out more if it had been directed by Oliver Stone(it is closer to the films and style of Stone than it is to the films and style of Ridley Scott),Ridley Scott's style of direction on \\"American Gangster\\" still works well. This is by Ridley Scott allowing \\"American Gangster\\" to balance out the drug operation depicted by the movie and the documentation of Frank Lucas and Richie Roberts' personal lives to not overlap,the operation depiction being suspenseful and a thorough and entertaining portrait of New York City in the 60's and 70's being painted. Add all of that together with strong acting,and with \\"American Gangster\\",you have an informative and \\"entertaining\\" film.    Well worth the time and the money.
B000I5X81A|4.0|vinyl-length album in here.  Put Danger, Heads In Georgia, Sporting Life Blues, Dead End Road, Hard To Thrill, Anyway The Wind Blows, Three Little Girls, Don't Cry Sister, Who Am I Telling You, and Ride The River in your iPod, and you have EC's best album at least since Riding With The King.  The other four tracks just aren't as good, and would likely have been the outtakes in the days of the elpee.  (Then we'd be clamoring for them as extra tracks on a reissue or something.)    His best since Riding With The King, I says, and I don't think it's any coincidence that Riding, too, was a co-headliner gig, a collaboration with one of Clapton's big influences.  Cale's presence, and his songs, seem to have inspired Clapton just like B.B.'s did, and the result is just as good, although it walks the Tulsa side of EC's territory rather than the Delta side.      The difference isn't just stylistic, though.  On Riding, Clapton's and King's voices were so different, and their guitar styles so distinct (surprising, given how much Clapton got from King's style), that it was always clear who was contributing what.  Here, not only are there seven credited guitarists, most of whom Clapton could be mistaken for, but Cale's and Clapton's voices sound so similar, and are mixed so close together, that it's genuinely difficult to tell who's singing at times.  They sound like brothers, or alter-egos.  Appropriate, although disconcerting at times.    As with most post-Cream EC efforts, if you're listening just for guitar fireworks you're going to be a little disappointed.  They're here, but the most memorable guitar lines belong (I *think* - I wish every Clapton release came with a track chart like the ones in the Layla box) to Derek Trucks on \\"Anyway The Wind Blows.\\"  It has that sinuous, luminescent Allmans sound.  But Clapton gets his licks in, too, as do Cale, Bramhall, and everybody else.  Dig the successive guitar statements in Danger:  I don't know who's playing what, but it's all sweet as honey.    Mostly what you get, though, is really in-the-pocket, comfortable playing.  The band(s) just hit the sweet spot.  It's country soul music, in spirit not too terribly far from that Cosmic American Music Gram Parsons talked about:  a little blues, a little country, a little western, a little pop, a little rock, a little gospel.  You can tell this the kind of thing EC's been chasing, off and on, since the early '70s;  this time he really nails it.      I say band(s):  the musician credits take up a whole page, so there's really no way to know what combination of players is on any given track.  What can be identified deserves special mention, though:  Billy Preston providing Hammond licks just as tasty as ever (some of his last, RIP);  John Mayer more than holding his own on his co-written Hard To Thrill;  and that fiddle player on Dead End Road, fulfilling all the country promise made by the empty Vince Gill collaboration on Back Home.    If you're really into EC's revisitation of his Tulsa fling, it's worth noting that he contributed a song in this vain (Positively) to Jamie Oldaker's Mad Dogs & Okies album, and a duet with Tony Joe White on Did Somebody Make A Fool Out Of You on White's album Uncovered, both in 2006.  Neither are quite as strong as what's here, though.

B000FGGE68|4.0|There are two types of Milla Jovovich fan. Many admire her as an actress. That kind of fan likes to see her in movies like Joan of Arc. The other type of fan just likes to see her, regardless of the movie because she is one of the sexiest actresses to hit the wide screen in a long time. That kind of fan zeros in on her fabulous physique and doesn't notice the kinds of gaffes that plague this movie.<br /><br />That first kind of fan will consider this movie to be a dud. The second kind will not be disappointed with this movie, which features Milla Jovovich repeatedly in gymnastic performances in fom-fitting outfits. The fight choreography is above average, and the movie has some other worthy technical merits. The plot could have been more believable and the characters should have been better developed.<br /><br />This movie is obviously not the caliber of Joan of Arc, but it's still entertaining and not just because we get to see Milla Jovovich's awesome body from a variety of angles. If you're looking for something worthy of critical acclaim, this isn't it. If you just want to escape into a movie that stars one hot babe, Ultraviolet fits the bill.

0316010669|1.0|On the average I read about 6 books a month. In the last 12 months this is the worst book I've read. It's not just boring it's simply awful. Imagine a meal where they served up a decent salad then your second course was another salad not much different than the first, then your entree was a really big salad and the meal was finished off with a desert of, you guessed it by now didn't your, salad.    This book is a series of stories about how things happen really fast and that some people can tell really quick whether something is authetic art, a dangerous situation, whether someone is a virtuoso muscian, etc.    But the \\"meat\\" that's missing from all this salad is the basics of how to develop that skill and whether there is really any difference between intuition and dumb luck.    The chapters second guessing law enforcement officers that have to make life and death decisions in nano-seconds is particuliarly egregious.      This book is sold on a promise of a premise that would be useful in everyday life. No way, it's another \\"I wrote one interesting book, now I'm going to take advantage of it as soon as I can with something I'll throw together as quick as I can\\".    this is no \\"tipping point\\".  Run don't walk away from this dog.
B000R348BM|4.0|It's the best album the allman brothers ever made and what makes it really special is that it's a gold original master recording.
B000UCEJEQ|2.0|For myself, Annie Lenox has forever been one of the great voices in pop music since I first heard her in the early 80's...I fell in love with her unique sound almost instantly. For the most part since she's been solo her works have been imaginative and heartfelt...especially her last effort Bare and certainly Diva before that. This collection of songs just seemed to have nothing to pull it together to capture the listener, nothing unique to entrance or pull me in itself. Dark Road and Big Sky I would say were the only two songs on the collection for me that I can really say I liked to some degree...such a shame. I had waited in great anticipation for her new cd  as did all her fans, I only wish the wait had been worth it more so. I still enjoy her voice immensely, just not this collection of songs.
B000059T00|2.0|It was a one hit wonder.  \\"Can't find my way home\\" to me is the only good song but it was good enough to buy the album because I really like that song.

0790732203|4.0|This was a great movie to rent and watch in my teens, and it's still fun. Forget what a jerk Tom Cruise is in real life, there's no denying this is fun (and that Rainman is superb, but that's another story). In this movie, TC plays Joel, a young man with sickening parents (are they EVER understanding in these movies? If they were, what kinda fun would it be to watch?). Joel's got a hot mom I wanna do it with, but she's preoccupied with her stupid egg. TALK ABOUT ANAL RETENTIVE!! Joel's just a decent guy who's horny and meets Rebecca DeMornay (daughter of Wally George, whose album ROCKS!! Wonder what happened to him...)...he meets Lana, and --no, I can't give away what happens in this tension-filled drama! Guido--man of a thousand nightmares--was it me, or did he seem like Pacino on the screen? Anyways, Joel looks up to his friend, Booger (don't we all?). Now, the unfortunate thing about this movie is that not enough time is given to Booger. But he has the best line, words to live by--'cept I have to censor it here--(ahem!)--\\"sometimes you just gotta say, WHAT THE HECK!!\\" And he's RIGHT!! For IF you do, you will soon be involved with a BE-YOO-TIFUL prostitute, and you won't have to listen to Phil Collins when you have sex.  The ONLY bad scene is, unfortunately, the most famous one--Cruise dancing around in his underwear, miming to \\"Old Time Rock 'n' Roll\\" by Bob Seger. Now, I like some Seger, but not this cheesy-sounding song. WHEW! It's a damn good thing that the producers of this movie didn't choose some really GREAT tune--or even just a better one, like say, Takin' Care Of Business, that's a good song, and thankfully I don't think of Cruise dancing in his undies to it. Also good that no other Seger is used--I mean, it's not hard to imagine the train scene preceded by part of Night Moves, now that's a classic.  This movie is great if you're young and horny; even Joel's teacher has a nice ass (good camera work). (if you like really sexually-oriented movies, I highlyrecommend Pretty Maids All In A Row--it's a dark comedy, but its just as non-stop tension-filled need-sex-now kinda deal as this.  There's some genuinely tender moments in this, and Cruise has never been more likable in a film--hell, he's a creep in Rainman (and that's Dustin's movie all the way!).  so, let's forget the brief scene of him dancing (\\"I'm not enjoying this...I think I'm gonna throw up!\\"). YEAH, it's too bad Booger didnt throw up on Cruise, but nevertheless this is one entertaining flick, with really only vague pretenses to reality. Unless you're looking for a really cerebral movie, you'll enjoy this. It's hard not to.  STILL, I wish that the DVD could have added the original unreleased, shown-only-to-test-audiences ending, a real BUMMER one!! I'd love to see the original ending. Seriously, viewing this movie should be part of every young guy's adolescence. It's pretty cool--not a GREAT film, but who cares?! It's FUN.  now GET OFF THE BABYSITTER!!!  And check this flick out.
0446677450|5.0|This book will totally change your perspective about working at a job vs being an entrepreneur or owning a business.I would recommend this be required reading for high school students or even junior high. Our society has been programmed to go to school and get a good job instead of to explore all our options. This book opens your way of thinking about that.
B000ROALCG|5.0|I just saw the movie a few nights ago and I had not heard much of Hector's music before this. I love the CD! The production and playing is incredible. I think Marc does a great job and I am looking forward to exploring more of his stuff too.    DJ-RJ  Music4Life
0316779237|5.0|Fantastic. David Sedaris does not disappoint with this collection of short stories.  If you have an appreciation for sarcastic humor and dry wit, you will be doubled over with laughter in no time.
B000ICL3KG|5.0|Despite I am a proud republican, I think this is a great movie. Don't  get blind before Gore only because he's a democratic guy, what he's  explaining is pure \\"truth\\", scientifically proved. More people must be  aware of this REAL problem and act quickly! Be part of the solution and  not of the problem, I am a proud American and proud America produced  such a movie. And since I believe so strong in my country and people, I think we can change this stupid way we keep running. I hate to be known as the second bigger polluter in the world after Australia, that's really a shame and we can't ignore it. If you ignore it, you don't love enough your country and your world.

1580176941|5.0|I needed a special hostess gift for a friend who bakes and also loves to add creativity and fun to food presentation.  I was so glad to find \\"Cookie Craft\\" as the perfect book to give her (very reasonably priced too considering all the recipes, photos, patterns and tips inside.)  My friend was so excited to thumb through the pages. She immediately planned out numerous cookies she wants to bake for the Holidays (Hanukkah included which is a nice plus).  My friend was also keen on making cookies for some grown-up occasions as shown in the book which I never would have thought of-- an upcoming bridal shower and a \\"girl's only night.\\"   As someone who will be a guest at these parties too, I can't wait to see how these cookies turn out and how the other people react.  We tend to think of cookies as a child's treat, but as my friend pointed out--watch who eats the cookies at a party--it is definitely the grown-ups too!    I highly recommend \\"Cookie Craft\\" for anyone who wants to entertain with special and unique cookies throughout the year.
B000W1V5VU|4.0|I purchased Ocean's Thirteen because I enjoyed Eleven and Twelve. All techie details and between movie comparisons don't matter tremendously to me. I didn't watch it with a check list and detailed focus to make sure all the facts lined up perfectly. My review will be different on that level. I love a good story, snappy dialogue and fun characters. I want my movies to either entertain or make me think. Ocean's Thirteen is entertaining. Not perfect, but entertaining.<br /><br />Though less technically splendid than Twelve and the laser dance, Ocean's Thirteen still delivers. Neither of the females from Eleven and Twelve return but Ellen Barkin lends a feminine touch.<br /><br />The charm of the previous films still plays out. I love the camaraderie and bantering. The campy, quirky blending of outlaw \\"good guys\\" is still fun. I like the differing points of view, piecy film editing, the time twists and the final reveal of missing details.<br /><br /> Al Pacino is a nice addition to the cast and Terry Benedict's turn as a semi-good guy produces a few laughs.<br /><br />Thirteen may not be enjoyable unless you've watched the other two. If you have and liked them both I think Thirteen is a safe bet for you.
1416523359|3.0|In this book we get to know Lisey. A woman who`s mind wanders in thoughts of her deceased husband. Stephen King does a superb job of letting us get to know their long lost relationship; thoughts and everyday gestures between a couple deeply in love. As the story travels forward, her memories and the world of her husbands meanstreak comes back to her.  This escalates into something beyond this world...  I was a little disappointed when I finished reading this book. Mainly because I wanted more of King`s bad- gunky (for those who have read the book!) fantasies. But as a combination between love, horror and fantasy stories; it ain`t bad.
B000UJ48U4|5.0|I have seen this movie twice. First in it's original NC-17, Uncut version than mistakenly in the R Rated format. I could immediately see and notice from the movie's beginning until the end , see the differences between the two. The Uncut version by far is the best. You view the R version and will miss this movie's true occultic display.  In saying so, I ordered this movie once with two additional replacements because I recieved the R version each time. The first movie I opened and in viewing the main menu noticed immediately that the DVD is not RATING selectable as the box cover denotes.   ***This movie is only SELECTABLE in different ratings as specifically chosen when purchased.   ***Meaning you get one version or the other not both.  Amazon has change this movie's descriptions and ratings twice because of this.    First from NC-17 to Unrated.   Second by adding the erroneous following ill-correcting footnote.  (NOTE: The version of Eyes Wide Shut on this DVD is the unrated version, not the R-rated version. The packaging may incorrectly state that the R-rated version is included.)    *** This will unfortunately make those whom have not seen Mr. Kubrick's uncut version into falsely making a bad purchase. I will try to purchased the uncut version when Amazon finally fixes this distribution error.
B00003CXAT|4.0|The storyline is a simple one.<br />Billionaire John Hammond (Richard Attenborough)has sponsored as his latest pet project, an amusement park of cloned dinosaurs on the island of Isla Nublar.<br />Hammond invites a group of scientists to visit the park, including world renowned paleontologist Dr. Alan Grant (Sam Neill) and Grant's sweetheart and paleobotanist Dr. Ellie Sattler (Laura Dern). They take a vehicular tour of the park accompanied by Hammond's two young granchildren Lex (Ariana Richards) and Tim (Joseph Mazello).<br />What starts as a fascinating foray into the re-awakened world of prehistory, turns into a nightmare, as sabotage and a fierce tropical thunderstorm, traps the tourists, and unleashes a bunch of dinosaurs gone completely wild.<br />The film can be best remembered for the incredible special effects, and the amazing recreation of the dinosaurs making for some thrilling soundbites.<br />The real stars, apart from of course the dinosaurs, are Ariana Richards Joseph Mazello who are just naturals as the kids who accompany the scientists, and get just the right balance, as American kids in a  fantastically surreal situation.
B000UR9T8C|3.0|Spider-Man 3 has been hyped as the best of the trilogy. I have to respectfully disagree. While not bad, it is the WEAKEST of the trilogy. On its own, its a good film but when compared to the first two (especially Spider-Man 2), it falls short. Here is my take:    PROS - James Franco's portrayal of Harry Osborn remains strong here. His \\"New Goblin\\" is arguably the best villian in this film though he later turns good to help Spidey against The Sandman and Venom. Also, I found this one to be funnier in spots than the first two. Particularly Tobey Maguire's performance as \\"Bad Peter\\" when he acquires his black suit. The dance scene in the club was amazing and probably one of the better non-super scenes in the film! I also thought that the Sandman was handled well. The CG's for him were incredible!     CONS - Speaking of Maquire, his and Kirsten Dunst's performances were still good but not as strong here. I blame that more in the writing though. Not enough Aunt May or J. Jonah Jameson in this one too.    Bottom line here is this, there was too much stuff crammed into one film. In other words, some of this stuff could've easily been held over for a Spider-Man 4 if not for contractual concerns. I personally would've had just the Sandman and the black costume situation here and held Venom for a fourth film. Speaking of Venom, his character development was very rushed in my opinion. Another film could've fleshed him out much better!    Overall, this film isn't a waste of money BUT I'd get it at a reduced price. While nowhere near as bad as some other superhero films such as Hulk, Daredevil (theatrical version/not the uncut), Batman & Robin (1997), Superman IV, Spawn and Steel, it falls way short of the first two Spidey films! I enjoyed the two Fantastic Four movies more than I did this one and that's sad!    If you are a family oriented viewer however, then its probably the most moral of the 3 films. Not that the other two weren't virtuious but this one seems to make a pointabout morality without shoving it down your throat.     Anyway, I'd get it at a reduced price or part of that 3-pack that comes with the first two movies. Even with this weak offering however, I am glad I was around to see my favorite childhood comic hero come to life in these three films.
B000VLE3GA|4.0|There seems to be some confusion over \\"Mothership\\" especially with regard to the 'sound'. While it's not exactly the 'Motherlode' in terms of track content - SOUNDWISE - it is streets ahead of what's been offered before and at times just BREATHTAKING in its clarity. (For the rest - see the end of this review).<br /><br />Here's the lay of the land first:<br /><br />The albums \\"Led Zeppelin\\" though to \\"Houses Of The Holy\\" ('69 to '73) were originally released in the UK on Atlantic Records and from \\"Physical Graffiti\\" onwards on their own imprint label \\"Swan Song\\" ('75 to '79, distributed by Atlantic). The awful live double that is \\"The Song Remains The Same\\" from 1976 is wisely not featured at all on \\"Mothership\\". The 8-track odds and sods album \\"Coda\\" from 1982, which features studio out-takes and live tracks recorded between 1969 and 1978, isn't featured either. As you'll see from the list below - all the other official studio albums are:<br /><br />Disc 1 (66:18 minutes):<br />Tracks 1 to 4 are from their debut \\"Led Zeppelin\\" (January 1969)<br />Tracks 5 to 7 are from \\"Led Zeppelin II\\" (October 1969)<br />Tracks 8 and 9 are from \\"Led Zeppelin III\\" (October 1970)<br />Tracks 10 to 13 are from \\"Led Zeppelin IV\\" (November 1971)<br />(Officially their 4th album is untitled, but of course it's often referred to as \\"Led Zeppelin IV\\" or \\"Four Symbols\\" or \\"Runes\\" or \\"ZoSo\\" after the four symbols that appear on the original LP at the top of the Atlantic Records label - Zodiac letters for each member of the band).<br /><br />Disc 2 (69:21 minutes):<br />Tracks 1 to 4 are from \\"Houses Of The Holy\\" (April 1973)<br />Tracks 5 to 7 are from \\"Physical Graffiti\\" (February 1975, a 2LP set)<br />Tracks 8 and 9 are from \\"Presence\\" (March 1976)<br />Tracks 10 and 11 are from \\"In Through The Out Door\\" (August 1979)<br /><br />As you can see - \\"Zeppelin II\\" sees only 3 tracks on Disc 1, while the debut gets 4. This misses out on gems from \\"II\\" like \\"Moby Dick\\", \\"Livin' Lovin' Maid (She's Just A Woman)\\" and \\"What Is And What Should Never Be\\" - odd omissions for an album that is constantly cited in magazine polls by the public as their \\"favorite rock album ever\\". Worse however is \\"III\\", often referred to by fans as their 'acoustic' album. By only representing it with \\"Immigrant Song\\" and \\"Since I've Been Loving You\\", you get the 'feeling' that the album is like its two predecessors - 'hard rock' - when it actually contains some of their most beautiful and underrated softer tracks, especially the gorgeous acoustic workout \\"That's The Way\\". Four songs from the iconic and brilliant \\"IV\\" are only right and proper - and some would argue the entire album should be on here (the lyrics to \\"Black Dog\\" title this review).<br /><br />Downside: as you can see from the playing time, a full 13 minutes on Disc 1 could have been used up - and isn't. Extending the acoustic theme to \\"IV\\", the equally wonderful \\"The Battle Of Evermore\\" (Sandy Denny on backing vocals) is missing too when there was room. Coupled with \\"That's The Way\\", both would have made for huge bonuses and more importantly made the disc more representative of the band. The 'acoustic' element of Zeppelin, which was featured in most of their live sets, is oddly absent here - a mistake I think. Their diversity as a band - away from just hard rock - is one of the reasons for their enduring appeal and why fans love them so. \\"Hey Hey (What Can I Do Now)\\" the brilliant non-album B-side to the US 45 of \\"Immigrant Song\\" would have been a tasty choice too - but again - a no show.<br /><br />Upside: having said all of that, Disc 1 has very clever sequencing on it and listening to the song selection straight through is a superb and impressive experience. The space around the opening guitars of \\"Baby I'm Gonna Leave You\\" is ethereal and beautiful. The fabulous guitar-work in the left speaker on \\"Ramble On\\" from \\"II\\" catches your ear too - and Plant's double vocals - great.  I could hear the band count One Two Three on the fade in to \\"Immigrant Song\\". Genius choice however, goes to the stunning blues workout of \\"Since I've Been Loving You\\" from \\"III\\". Sounding just fantastic, the squeaking of Bonham's drum pedals can be heard just a few milliseconds before Page launches into that blistering guitar riff (lyrics above). And finally - at long last - the remastering has brought out the full ferocity of Bonham's drumming and Plant's harmonica playing in the simply awesome \\"When The Levee Breaks\\" - cleverly placed before \\"Stairway\\" and not after it - rounding off Disc 1 very nicely.<br /><br />The sound quality on Disc 1 in particular is BREATHTAKING. Page transferred the original master tapes carefully to digital in 1991 for \\"The Complete Studio Recordings\\" and John Davis of Alchemy Mastering in London has used these for the 2007 Remasters. THEY ARE BETTER. And in some cases unbelievably so.<br /><br />But it all goes a bit belly up on Disc 2.  It's clear the band feel that \\"Houses\\" is a bit under appreciated as an album, so no less than 4 tracks are featured, including the clever placing of the reggae \\"D'yer Maker\\" with Bonham and Jones both playing a rhythm section storm. But to leave off the melodic winner that is \\"The Rain Song\\" is a huge omission. Three from \\"Graffiti\\", but again the wonderful \\"Ten Years Gone\\" and the rocking \\"Custard Pie\\" are not here. For me \\"Presence\\" was a tedious listen in 1976 and still is now, despite people trying to reappraise it. I really don't need to hear the 10 minutes of \\"Achilles Last Stand\\" ever again when the blues finisher \\"Tea For One\\" would have been a braver choice. And last up is \\"In Through The Out Door\\" featured by \\"In The Evening\\", the album's great opener. But the truly awful \\"All My Love\\" finishes Disc 2 when the funkier \\"For Your Love\\" would have been better. Also - as with Disc 1 - with only 69 minutes used, there was enough room for a more varied picture.<br /><br />And why a DVD of what we already own, when a live disc should have been Disc 3 - representing the band in what 'they' feel is their best arena?<br /><br />The booklet is disappointing too. No album covers pictured! Where the hell is the artwork that was so integral to their releases? There's no fan pleasing rare 7\\" picture sleeves from around the world either - no sense of their global affection or effect - not even a UK or US discography! But David Fricke's essay is good - it gives a brief history of the band and its output across 12 pages. And at least the wholesale nicking of blues tunes is finally acknowledged in the writer's credits for \\"Whole Lotta Love\\" (a Willie Dixon song made famous by Muddy Waters), Anne Bredon for \\"Baby I'm Gonna Leave You\\" and Memphis Minnie for \\"When The Levee Breaks\\".<br /><br />Some have said this compilation is 'money for old rope' - I don't see it that way. Without doubt, the 1991 Remasters by Jimmy Page were way better than the crappy 80s issues when issued, but these 2007 upgrades have been long overdue and sounding as good as they do, they're to be welcomed. If ever a band deserved lavish attention spent on their catalogue - it's Zeppelin. The set it flawed for sure, but the sound is great! Personally I'm excited about buying better sonic versions of the albums when they eventually do come out.<br /><br />Hey Hey Mama indeed...<br /><br />PS - IMPORTANT ADDITION: I took my own advice with regard to track selection and went to iTunes to download \\"That's The Way\\" and \\"The Rain Song\\". To my astonishment and disappointment, they're EXACTLY THE SAME AS THE 1991 VERSIONS when I A/B them with what's on my hard-drive. As everyone knows the entire catalogue is advertised as REMASTERED and went on sale the day after Mothership was issued, but it craftily doesn't say 'when' they were remastered. What a MASSIVE DISAPPOINTMENT!<br /><br />In fairness to iTunes, the entire catalogue download does include all the studio albums, the \\"Mothership'\\" 2CD set, the redone live double \\"The Song Remains The Same\\"with its bonus tracks, the excellent and overlooked 3CD \\"How The West Was Won\\" live set, also with remastered Sound and even an extended version of \\"Coda\\" to take in the odd box set track like \\"Hey Hey (What Can I Do Now)\\".<br /><br />The important point with regard to the catalogue is this - it's clear that ONLY the \\"MOTHERSHIP\\" SET and \\"THE SONG REMAINS THE SAME\\" re-issue HAVE THE 2007 REMASTERED SOUND and NOT ANYTHING ELSE.<br /><br />So I would say that the purchase of the ENTIRE CATALOGUE is good value for money overall for newcomers, but for fans that already have the CD albums, avoid the iTunes downloads on INDIVIDUAL TRACKS outside the 'Mothership/The Song Remains The Same' sets.pictured!

B000WQW988|5.0|All I can say is \\"THANK YOU, THANK YOU, THANK YOU!!!\\"   Thank God this is finally available on DVD.  I have been waiting since the first time I saw it on Unplugged.  Words can not describe how great this performace is.  Everytime I listen to the CD I realize how much we lost when Kurt died.
B000VNMMQG|3.0|While Amazing Grace is a good movie, I wasn't as impressed as I hoped I would be. I much preferred Amistad. One of the reasons might be because I only watched it once but some movies, such as Amistad, take only one viewing to really leave an impression.  For me, I think one of the things that disappointed me was the lack of African-American actors and also, not enough was spent on the terrible aspects of the slave trade. I don't mean by that to say, horror filled scenes of the slave trade in action should have been shown except for maybe an example or two to give the audience somewhat of a feel for how horrible it really was. I know the movie was about William Wilberforce and his efforts to abolish the slave trade and, therefore, the story focused on him and rightly so. I just think a bit more of the African experience should have been shown as it would have re-inforced the good Wilberforce was trying to do.  I loved the ending performance of \\"Amazing Grace\\".
0440238609|5.0|A wonderfully complex series of books that keeps the action rolling and makes the reader think.  Fast paced and very unique.  Nothing reminds me of any other book I've ever read.  A superb work for young and old alike.
B000HC2LI0|5.0|It's really the series that you're buying, and what you're willing to spend on the packaging and the assorted extras goes a long way towards showing how much you value the show. This set, however, justifies the expenditure. It's smart, generous, and exactly what both a collector and a lover of the show would want.
B000B7BRMM|1.0|Well, I disagree with most of these reviews.  I own all of Ms Krall's cds and this is, I believe, her poorest.  Her voice is so coarse and so often off key in these arrangements that I felt compelled to listen carefully to a couple of her early cds as a reality test.  The same vocal issues are there too in the beginning, but just a little bit.  Her voice has changed to my ear, and not for the better.  And that little bit in the earlier cds is covered up by her solid, swinging piano, which clearly gets her into the music--her brio carries the day.  Not here.  A real disappointment.
B000WQ9UA8|4.0|Blackout...I digg it.  Her style, the sounds, the beats.  It's different and more grown up than ever before.  It feels like a recap of her steady decline.  But with this album, she's clearly come back, in a good way.      Lots of beats and new sounds, its fun, flirty and exciting. There isn't one song that blows like Dear Diary on her Oops album.  Gotta love her.  I just hope the next album will be more lyrically stimulating, but JUST as FUN!
B000Y179KO|5.0|This may be their best yet. The more I hear it the better it gets.

I was suprised as I thought it would be full of filler but it is not. If you are an Eagles fan do not hesitate to buy this. I know you have to go to Wal-Mart but it is worth it. Enjoy!
B000VSBX34|5.0|One thing is for sure if this doesn't take you back to simpler times, than you might as well just give up. Contained here is a an instant getaway back to 1965 with colour and images that you must just experience for yourself. This is the Beatles right where you will want them-just before it got kind of weird and spooky, when the guys still smiled a lot, and with hindsight knowing where they would go next. The last of the innocence whether we knew at the time or not. Buy it and enjoy!
B000003CMB|5.0|I have been listening this song almost every day for quite a while this year and I just can't get tired of it.  I think it's the strongest live jam I have ever heard.  I love when talented musicians deconstruct old tunes and put them back together with their own interpretations.  And the version of \\"You Don't Love Me\\" on this record is the greatest example of this I've come across.  Joy to the world, the Allman Brothers play on!
0440238609|1.0|This strange series follows the journey of a new age Adam and Eve on a quest to kill God and destroy religion. Don't be fooled by the pretty package and the Hollywood film, this is a heavy dose of anti-religious propaganda aimed at young minds. I can't believe such themes could even be considered for a children's book.
B000VNMMQG|5.0|While I had missed this movie at the theater, I knew that I wanted to add it to my collection. The quality of the DVD is excellent. Being a history buff, I have watched this DVD three times since it arrived four days ago. This movie is on my shelf next to AMISTAD and ROOTS.
B000NVIXDW|5.0|I first listened to Michael Buble with his song \\"Swing\\" that my mother loved.  She got his debut album \\"MIchael Buble\\" and I was listening to that one a lot.  I thought it was a good quality album, a classic.  I thought he might not be able to top that album but I was wrong.  \\"Call Me Irresponsible\\" is probably his best album yet.  I like every song and his voice continues to grow with every album unlike some artists who manage to get worse (Alicia Keys, Celine Dion, etc).  My favorite songs are \\"The Best Is Yet To Come\\" and \\"Always On My Mind.\\"  I remain a Michael Buble fan for life and kudos to him and his management for producing yet another flawless album.  If you like old standards this album is for you... HIGHLY RECCOMENDED!
B000VI70WM|4.0|This is definitely a different sound to what I expected to hear after 'Astronaut'. It's fresh and new, very experimental... and at least it's not a rehash of Astronaut. The Valley, Falling down, and Last man standing' are the hooks for me on this album. 'Night runner' and 'skin divers' are ok, but nothing uplifting or new. I would've prefered studio or reworked versions of 'Beautiful colours', 'Lonely business' or 'salt on the rainbow' for this album. All AMAZING songs, and should never have been left to die. These could've replaced some of the weaker ones here. I'm glad these lads are still pumping out tunes for us fans though.. I hope we dont' have to wait too long for the next album.
B000SFJWLU|5.0|With a voice sometimes reminiscent of tool, and a nice chunk in the music, this band is pretty killer.  I'm not a chick that goes for pounding double bass all the time and guitars so fast that you can't tell what chords are what.  If this stuff is thrash/speed metal whatever you wanna call it, I like it!  No wimpy songs here, nice melodies with a toughness to them.
B000VL9XE2|3.0|Um, yeah I knew this album would get very mixed reviews from people from the moment I heard it.    Let me be clear:  I'm one of those guys who gets aggrivated when a band goes and puts out a \\"black album\\" (we're all talking about Metallica, right?)    So why don't I hate this album?  I can't figure it out.  I put it in my car and quickly had a puzzled look by track three, unsure how I felt.  Yet I'm still listening to the thing.    Here's the deal.  I LOVE MISS MACHINE.  This ain't Miss Machine.    DEP is still skilled as ever.  Their chops are solid, no question.  Furthermore, I don't care what anyone says, I like Greg's singing.  A lot.  He can do the screaming thing just fine but if I focus only on his SINGING voice, I actually say he sounds good.  It's not thin, it's got body and warmth.  Plenty of other bands have singers who scream well but their singing sounds thin.  Greg is better than that.    There's more electronic effects used on this album and I'll actually say it's put to better use than I've heard in a long while.  It's integrated with the music thoughtfully and has a symbiosis with the guitars.  98% of the time when any band feels like toying with electronic sound, it ends up being some filler track between songs and leaves me saying \\"so what?\\"  Usually it sounds like someone was playing around with toys in the studio during recess and they decided to throw it in there just because.    Really.  A lot of things are done right on this album.    But what about it isn't quite sitting with me (and I'll bet a lot of others?)  I think it's because what we've always loved about Dillinger is the chaos of their music.  It wasn't sloppy, it was very calculated ... but their music was just a GLEEFUL CELEBRATION OF CHAOS.  It's the kind of music that no one over the age of twenty should be able to listen to.  (Incidentally, I'm turning 32 next month.)  Am I saying your parents will like this album?  Absolutely not.  They'll hate it as much as their others ... butthey'll be able to wrap their brains around it.  My dad would hate this album but he'd basically understand it.  Their older material is difficult even for me to fully figure out, I can only imagine if my dad tried to listen to it.  That happy indulgence in insanity and excess just isn't there now.    When I listen to Calculating Infinity, I feel it's the musical equivalent of a five year old boy discovering for the first time the usefulness of a hammer ... while he's standing in front of the cabinet holding those dishes mom only pulls out for \\"special occasions.\\"  With Ire Works, it just feels like that little boy full of id has lost interest in that hammer.
B000UK73QO|5.0|I was quite resistent to some of the subjects of this book on the first reading, And I am now reading it for the third time. Each time I'm gaining new insights. This is the first Tolle book I have read. The profound effect this book's message has had on me and people around me made me choose to purchase 4 copies for family, then another 4 for friends and now another 4 for presents. Having been a seeker of truth most of my life, and having read many books with a spiritual message, I found this book helped getting beyond some ingrained stumbling blocks. Let me add, that the books given out were given with the option to read or not to read. So far I am aware of immense insights this book has instigated in several people, whose relationships and ability to accept life as it is has greatly grown.
1594489505|1.0|What a disappointment.  The author is not a woman, and he cannot convey a genuine female experience, let alone two different experiences. He 'gets' the male characters, but how can a male pretend to know what an abused, terrorized woman feels like?  I feel like his publisher pushed him to make a deadline.  This effort is not anywhere close to the precision, beauty and sense of truth of The Kite Runner. Perhaps Number Three will work for us all.
B000V6BE6C|5.0|Let me begin by saying that a7x was my favorite band when I heard Waking the Fallen, and I've been with them since 2003.  With that said, I will say that I was not overly wild about City of Evil. It was good, but I will definitely say that their self-titled performance is better.  I had become nervous about this album when a7x began projects with Korn and Good Charlotte, but it pleasantly surprised me with a ballsy adventurous ride.  Shadows' vocals are a LOT better on this album than the previous one. He found his appropriate range, and the addition of the Rev's backing vocals on select tracks is a brilliant one.   Before you dismiss this album, give it at least 3 listens. The first listen through, I didn't like it much. The songs sounded dreadfully similar, and not too impressive to begin with. The more listens I took, though, the more I enjoyed it. The best song is easily A Little Piece of Heaven.  Just a note - don't be fooled by the first teaser video they released for the album. There is no screaming on this album, which was sort of inferred by a number of people when the first few seconds released from this album was Shadows screaming his head off in the beginning of Critical Acclaim. Despite this, it is definitely a great album and worth your time and money.
0307277887|4.0|I read all the hype and bought the book.  I expected the main character to be on the light and likeable side - boy was I wrong.  Dexter is dark and twisted and I never found myself looking on him as a good guy gone wrong.  He wasn't someone who was doing the world a favor by ridding us of the vermin who skulk in the dark corridors of the night.  He was only scratching an itch in his tweaked psyche. He's a bad guy, albeit not his fault - he's an ultimate victim in this culture of victimization.  I just couldn't stop reading.  It was like watching a train crash - you can't just turn away.  I continued the page turning until the end and then asked myself what in hell I was doing reading this trash - and then went out and bought book 2 in the series.  Guess that tells it all....bg
B000TX7B5U|4.0|This album had no expectations from me until I heard Empty Walls.  Then I couldn't wait for this album.  All I can say is that half the tracks are phenomenal, and the other half are rather forgettable.    I LOVE: Empty Walls, Unthinking Majority, Money, Feed Us, Lie, Lie, Lie, Sky Is Over  I Can live without: Saving Us, Baby, Honking Antelope, Praise the Lord and Pass the Ammunition, Beethoven's C, Elect the Dead.  None of the latter songs are bad, they just aren't ones that I would listen to if I wasn't playing the record through.  As a whole, though, I'd definitely recommend this album.
B0000025T6|5.0|Like a lot of people, I find Springsteen's more mainstream stuff catchy but perhaps a little superficial. I mean, sure there's the entire working-class ethos going on, but someone the barroomesque party effect seems to artificially limit the effect. Instead, I always found myself far more drawn to the stripped-down stuff, such as The River. Nebraska is all stripped-down; just a guitar and harmonica and his voice, with slower, compelling songs that come across as far more measured and perceptive than more energetic stuff with an entire band. It probably won't strike any chords with Jersey party girls or your frat buddies, but the songs are effective and insidious. Great stuff.
1401322336|5.0|Very good book have had a good read and am about to start making some of Jamie's great recipes have had to order another or I wouldn't get my one back from my Step-daughter.  I always try to watch his TV series and love the great ideas that he has.  You will not be disappointed with this book.
B000UX6THK|5.0|I don't have to speak so much for the quality of the series-- because i think we all know that it is top notch... What excites me is having everything available together for the first time... Also the show never looked so good they obviously did a lot of work on this.. The price is fairly reasonable considering the contents..
B000V1Y43W|5.0|Contrary to the person who reviewed that this was in aspect ratio of 1:33, it is NOT--it is in full HIGH DEF 2.4 1920x1080 with 7.1 Dolby Digital sound.<br />It is gorgeous--they did a wonderful job with lighting, effects, etc.  We have both the Widescreen regular version as well as this Blu Ray and it's a world of difference.  Of course, with Blu Ray, you see SO much more, but even I was surprised with how much more crisp an animated picture could be.<br />The movie itself is cute--has a GREAT message, and of course, lots of adult humor mixed in with the kids' stuff.  Great movie for all ages.  Gotta have a Blu-Ray player--whether it be a PS3 or a separate unit, it's a must-have for any HD home.<br />Oh, and the soundtrack is great, too!
0316010669|1.0|Blink, is predominately a collection of outcomes from previous research on unconscious thinking.  In the first half of the book, the author tries to categorize rapid, unconsciousness decision making as an \\"instinct\\" that the human mind makes on its own.  The second half of the book the author wonders off into a re-interpretation of unconscious thinking as something that is a product of extensive training and experience.  The preface of the book is \\"The power of thinking without thinking\\".  With the two different interpretations of unconscious thinking, I am not sure the thesis of the book was proven.  For anyone with little education into the human mind, this could be a good primer on unconscious thinking, otherwise, leave it alone.
B0001I551K|4.0|Space Battleship Yamato was the source material for the anime that would become known in the U.S. as Star Blazers.  This movie takes the twenty-six episode series and whittles it down to a 135 minute film, only using the sections of the series that are absolutely necessary to tell the main story of the series (the Earth being polluted by the Planet Gamilus, the crew of the rebuilt Yamato making the 148,000 light year voyage to Iscandar to get a neutralizer to rid Earth of the pollution... and must accomplish it all within one Earth year).<br /><br />This isn't bad for what it is, which is an overview film for the first season.  The DVD release also includes the original theatrical trailer and alternate animation footage (both of which are subtitled), the original program book (which is translated), a gallery of promotional art, and a history behind the Yamato franchise.
B000VI70WM|3.0|Although this collection of songs is okay it does not measure up to the anticipation and delivery of Astronaut. Upon first hearing Astronaut, I was thrilled to hear the original sounds of DD. When I first listened to RCM, I could help but think \\"sell out\\". Why try to sound like so many other songs out there. I suppose they are trying to appeal to the younger generation, but stick with making the DD music that your core fans appreciate. The band's website said they put aside all the songs they had written originally and started fresh with the songs on RCM. I'll be waiting for the next batch of songs...hopefully not three years!!
B000YABIQ6|5.0|Attention goons at AMC! Pleeeeeeeeeeease don't wait forever and a day to release the season 1 DVD set for your marvelous evocation of the New Frontier era, you know, the transition period between the relative comformity of the Eisenhower era, and full-blown upheaval of the mid to late 1960s and its various social revolutions. MAD MEN has been far and away the best and deepest program that television has had to offer in 2007. God bless you for producing it!
0380820846|5.0|This is my favorite book of the Bridgerton Series. Penelope is very likeable and I believe many women can identify with her. She is a wallflower, not fashionably thin, aging (26), and has never had even one proposal of marriage. She has been in love with Colin since she was a teenager and he and his family were her champions during her awkward first season. Though, Colin has never noticed her romantically.     Colin, like all the Bridgerton males is great. However, he battles insecurity and jealousy as he struggles to find a legacy in life. His older brothers have a viscountship and an artistic career respectively.     The book begins with Colin's return from Cyprus. When he meets Penelope at his mother's birthday ball they quickly resume their comfortable friendship. But then, with a push from Lady Danbury (Lady D, who appears in the other Bridgerton novels as well as in Quinn's How to Marry a Marquis)Penelope becomes more brave and confident. Colin begins to fall in love with Penelope and in turn finds out a huge secret that she has been keeping for years. Penelope, likewise, discovers Colin is an excellent writer. She pushes him to publish his works which is met with some trepidation. Meanwhile, Colin has to work damage control when Penelope's nemesis threatens to expose her big secret.    This book is a real page turner. I have read it several times and never tire of it! I highly recommend!
0451216725|4.0|This review is for the New American Library (Division of Penguin) softcover edition, December 2005, 372 pages. CODE TO ZERO was on the USA Today's Top 150 Best-Selling books list for twenty-two weeks achieving the peak position to fifteen. Ken Follett has ten novels on this best-seller list, which has tracked book sales since October 1993. Follett had other best sellers before then.<br /><br />Around five in the morning, on January 29, 1958, a man wakes up in the men's room at Union Station, Washington D.C. He cries out in shock at his reflection in the mirror. He sees an unshaven hobo in filthy rags, and he has no recollection, none whatsoever. He shouts, \\"Who am I.\\" Another bundle of rags on the floor replies, \\"You're a bum, Luke.\\"<br /><br />The reader learns that a woman in a motel near Cape Canaveral is worried about Luke, and that she met him during a panty raid at Radcliff in 1941. On page 31, Luke, penniless, wandering around D.C. with global amnesia, realizes two men are shadowing him. He does not know that someone in the CIA thinks he's the most dangerous man in America.<br /><br />And so this espionage thriller continues, with Luke sleuthing out who he is, and the reader knowing not much more than he does. The story is suspenseful, fast paced, and true to the time when nice girls were virgins, gentlemen wore hats and Hudson automobiles were not relics.
B00004TH83|5.0|My family has owned and listened to Lara for years yet remain always in complete awe of her near perfect vocal abilities.  She is an amazing melding of Celine Dion & Mariah Carey, but unlike those two, she presents her vocal talents without pretense - pure music.<br />Lara Fabian is gifted in many languages and easily represents herself in French, Italian and Spanish (oh and English of course).  I will likely never hear another who's so gifted vocally; who can better the power of Dion, has cleaner virtuosity than Mariah and yet can suddenly drop down into the most mesmerizing pianissimos.  I would simply consider this voice to be akin to a concert pianist who can at will do whatever is wished musically.<br />If you've not heard her, you miss a superbe talent!
0439882826|5.0|This book is one of the most amazing things I have ever seen.  It has a main pop-up in the center of each page, and then pop-ups on some of the corners of each page.  The last page has battery operated light sabers that pop up & automatically turn on (give it a few seconds to turn on)!  Well worth the money!!!!
0743298039|5.0|I finished this book a few days ago and have not started another because I am still savoring this Gothic wonder. While paying homage to the obvious influences of Woman in White, Jane Eyre and Wuthering Heights with several direct references, Setterfield absolutely holds her own amongst these classics. While the atmosphere, melancholy and suspence (by way of a dusty bookstore, lonely mansions and ghosts), is everything you would want from the Victorians, Thirteenth Tale has a slightly modern sensiblity with the Tim Burtonesque topiary gardens and creepy twins...excellent! This book will absolutely join the pantheon of Gothic greats.
0143038419|2.0|I'm surprised this book was a bestseller.  The premise of the book is very interesting but I agree with other reviewers that the author is self-absorbed, immature and seriously lacking self esteem.  I can't believe how selfish and self-centered this woman is!!  She gives the stereotype, that women are neurotic, validity.  It's a good thing she doesn't want children because she definitely shouldn't have any.  As a conservative new mom, I found her views on motherhood and politics semi-offensive and irritating. That being said, I thought SOME of the book was well written and humorous.  I found a lot of her spiritual \\"exploration\\" to be irritating but it did make me think about my own spirituality.  And I did enjoy the historical and cultural information she included, written with a nice twist.  If you are trying to pass a rainy day, it's not the worst book to read.   There were parts of the book that were difficult to get through but overall it's a pretty \\"easy read\\".
B000TJBNFI|5.0|Paul Sheldon (James Caan) is a very successful writer of romance and thriller novels, one snowy night he crashes his car and a lonely woman named Annie (Kathy Bates) rescues him and provides shelter for him. She happens to be Sheldon's biggest fan and would do anything to be with him as her wish has come true, even though she's a bit on the psychoctic side as she wants him to do a novel based on her wish-fulfillments and wants to keep him as her personal prisoner.<br /><br />A twisted and brilliant modern horror thriller classic that is quite faithful to Stephen King's suspense novel and is adapted by William Goldman and directed by Rob Reiner. The film co-stars legendary Lauren Becall, this movie is one of the greatest cinematic horror and psychological thrillers ever! in fact, Ms. Bates got an oscar for best actress for the memorable role of Annie. This is a truly unforgettable movie with such disturbing moments like the sledgehammer sequence, great acting and dark atmosphere.<br /><br />This Collector's Edition DVD contains excellent picture and sound with fine extras like two audio commentaries, 7 featurettes, teaser and trailer which makes this a true must own for fans of horror and thrillers cause this one is a winner all the way.<br /><br />Also recommended: \\"Black Christmas (1975)\\", \\"Funny Games\\", \\"The Shining (1980)\\", \\"Psycho (1960)\\", \\"Psycho II\\", \\"Audition\\", \\"Deep Red\\", \\"Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer\\", \\"Psycho III\\", \\"Vertigo\\", \\"Rear Window\\", \\"Basic Instinct\\", \\"Rope\\", \\"Nightmare (1981 a.k.a.

B00005JPS9|5.0|Written around 700 AD and being of unknown authorship, \\"Beowulf\\" may be one of the purest fantasies ever told--it was one of the first to tell the story of a warrior who fought demons and a dragon. In the hands of director Robert Zemeckis and screenwriters Neil Gaiman and Roger Avary, the story transcends what we might have envisioned when reading the epic poem. This latest film adaptation is a triumph of classic storytelling, giving us a both hero to root for and monsters to be afraid of; it's a story told in the language of entertainment, having the power to capture its audience with compelling characters and breathtaking visuals. It's an honest to goodness fable that tells it like it is, completely free of long-winded setups and complicated details.    Relying on the same motion capture technique he utilized in \\"The Polar Express,\\" Zemeckis has crafted an entirely computer generated film that has an appropriately surreal look. This is especially true of the characters, which exist in a gray area between the realistic and the fantastic; they don't look phony by any means, but they're not completely authentic, either. I suppose part of this can be blamed on the limits of computer technology, which still isn't able to fool an audience despite major advances. The thing is, I don't think the film should have looked too realistic, simply because it's telling an unrealistic story. \\"Beowulf\\" is a purely imaginative piece, and as such, the film needed a purely imaginative look. Zemeckis chose to make the entire thing one big special effect--there are no individual effects that enhance live-action scenes.    Taking place in the sixth century, Ray Winstone voices the title character with the perfect mix of pride, arrogance, and youthful impulsiveness. He also gives Beowulf a hard-edged masculinity that's just as expected as it is cliché. Upon hearing that a monster is terrorizing a Danish kingdom, Beowulf and his Geat men come to the rescue. His motives are purely ego driven--he only wants to fight in glorious battle and be remembered for it. Stories of his past battles make this clear because they're all so dramatic, downright boastful. Basically, it's obvious that he's exaggerating practically everything he says to make himself look more like a hero. All arrogance aside, he does believe himself capable of killing the creature that attacked the mead hall of the drunken, disgraced King Hrothgar (Anthony Hopkins) and the quiet, suspicious Wealthow (Robin Wright Penn).    This creature is Grendel (Crispin Glover), a character that, like Frankenstein's Monster, is hideous yet pathetic. He's a grotesque sight to behold: he's massive, hunched over, and deformed, bearing little if any resemblance to a human being. His soft, pitiful voice--which speaks in a Scandinavian tongue--is pretty much his only connection to the rest of us. Here's a character that's truly nightmarish in appearance. And when his anger is added to the mix, it gets even worse; he loses control at the sounds of merrymaking, forcing him to retreat from his cave and attack the mead hall. As he breaks through the wooden door, the orange flames in the fire pit become a cold blue that engulf everything surrounding it. Beowulf is able to lure Grendel back by making his men sing, after which the two engage in fierce combat. Because Grendel has no armor or weapons, Beowulf decides to \\"fight him on equal terms\\" by stripping completely naked. How this was necessary, I have no idea, but I guess it doesn't really matter.    It's only after the battle is finished that Beowulf learns of Grendel's mother (Angelina Jolie), a seductive water demon whose feminine curves are accented by shifting slivers of gold paint. Her hair ends as a living, tentacle-like ponytail, and her feet are naturally high heeled. When Beowulf first meets her, he carries a golden horn given by Hrothgar as a gift; in the presence of Grendel's mother, the horn glows like molten metal, just as the water she emergesfrom becomes a phosphorescent blue. In this strange yet magically erotic atmosphere, she temps Beowulf with promises of fame and fortune. At what price, no one can say, but considering how fiercely protective she was of her son, I think it's safe to assume that it'll be quite high.    When the film flashes forward by a number of years, signs of Beowulf's age are not the only differences--his views on glory, battle, and fame have changed, forcing him to wonder if his years of arrogance were worth it. At one time, he would scream, \\"I am Beowulf!\\" at the drop of a hat, but now, there doesn't seem to be any reason to do that anymore. It doesn't help that he's keeping a big secret, one he's held onto for many years. The arrival of a monstrous fire-breathing dragon brings his past back up to the surface, and he must face it whether or not he's ready to.    But to face his past is to redefine what it means to be a hero. The young Beowulf believed it was all about winning battles, but the older Beowulf begins to feel that there's something more to it, something that doesn't rely on physical brute force and bloodshed. In Zemeckis' film, Beowulf is just like any character on a Hero's Journey: he matures as his quest nears its end. He looks back on what he's been through and is able to draw strength from it. This well-established narrative formula is one of the things that make \\"Beowulf\\" an incredibly enjoyable film; it follows the most basic rules of fantasy storytelling, which is both necessary and effective. This movie thoroughly accomplishes what it set out to accomplish--it's an engaging, exciting, and highly artistic vision, made with style and precision. Odin be praised.
0790729628|5.0|Harrison Ford and Rutger Hauer! What more could you ask? Very violent and some terrific emotional scenes (like the final scene with our two heroes on the roof.) Darryl Hannah and Edward James Olmos perform beautifully.  This is the directors' cut and is slanted a little differently from the original version, but still has a wonderful impact. I love it!
B000G7PNAE|5.0|An excellent CD which rightly belongs in the definitive 200 Hall of Fame record list. Should have been much higher on the list though. Has the great hits of Don't Stop Believin', Open Arms, Who's Crying Now. Other less popular but just as great tunes were Still They Ride, Stone in Love. Steve Perry's vocals on Mother, Father are extraordinary. Again, released in the collectible digipak with expanded booklets of tour dates and pictures. You won't be disappointed with this CD.
B000VI70WM|1.0|i have loved this band since i was a kid. when they reformed several years ago i was thrilled. 'astronaut' was awesome. my wife surprised me with a trip to see them on their last night in london, the one that was filmed for the concert dvd 'live from london', and we are in the front row, quite visible in several shots on the dvd. i have been a bass player for over 20 years because of this band. i can say without question i am a duranie geek.    what on earth were these guys thinking releasing this album? where's the MUSIC? one of the things i like about them is that they PLAY INSTRUMENTS! did andy leave because they were going to throw the MUSIC tracks away? i realize they have always gone after the latest producer types but...timbaland? justin timberlake?! UNBELIEVABLE!    this is really a terrible album guys... get andy back. beg him if you have to, and put out the record you scrapped...
B000V8I2QU|4.0|What to think of Magic? A record, which recalls, as well as reignites, one of rock n roll's most successful collaborations in Bruce Springsteen & the E Street Band.<br /><br />Now an elder statesman of the music industry another great Springsteen record can't help but recall everything else he has recorded in terms of musical choices, so the question becomes how much of Springsteen, along with The E Streeteters, past resonates in the here and now.<br /><br />The immediate response for me as a Springsteen fan, is the post 9/11 world is one where the opinionated and fiery charge behind songs like Radio Nowhere and Living In The Future creates a seething record of frustration laced with all the raged edge of a life in rock n roll. Whereas the younger Springsteen who railed on Born in the USA seemed a man coming to a realization about his country, the older Springsteen seems like an angry elder desperate to let out one last blast at all that seems wrong and on Magic he has that. Therefore much like the most brazen of senior to impatient to engage in tactful discussion, the Springsteen on Magic is in your face and blunt.<br /><br />Therefore whether bluntly asking who will be the Last to Die for a mistake or is there anybody alive out there, the Springsteen on Magic is wound up and bristling with lyrical intention. There is no running theme on Magic, unlike the 9/11 landscape investigated in The Rising, but one wonders if that is just because no one subject could hold The Boss in the here and now. Therefore it makes sense that the music on Magic plays more homage to his previous records because Springsteen the lyricist doesn't have time to reshape his sound, Magic instead pounces on what Springsteen & The E Street Band have done well before and still do well. Songs like Girls In Their Summer Clothes recalls Born To Run's wall of sound, Radio Nowhere could've easily slipped into Born In The USA and Clarence Clemons saxophone gets prominent inclusion on many songs, unlike The Rising, adding a nice touch of R&B nostalgia for Springsteen's earliest recordings.<br /><br />If Springsteen wasn't such a talented lyricist Magic could be considered purely an act of nostalgia at a time when the music industry can only reproduce established artists. But Springsteen has always been good at differentiating his intentions from his peers simply because the words that he sings always seem to be commenting on the here and now.<br /><br />The music on Magic maybe retro, but the commentary is fresh and timely therefore the music might not be the message because the lyrics are what require you to think.ice touch of R&B nostalgia for Springsteen's earliest recordings.

B000ULQV0W|5.0|If you like Pearl Jam, you'll love this album because it's Vedder at his best. You'll also love this album if you like the movie or the book because this album fits Chris's story extremely well. I can't stop listening to it.
B000V8I2QU|3.0|I chose 7 of the 12 songs (counting the hidden track)as being iPod worthy.  This is a lower percentage than is usual for a Springsteen recording.  Some recordings such as Ghost Of Tom Joad, Tunnel Of Love and Human Touch merit 100%, whereas his earlier two efforts merit close to 0%--but that's my personal taste.  But objectively, what I like the least about this recording is the sound quality.  The sound is garbled and fuzzy and I wished that Springsteen had stuck with Bob Clearmountain to mix his work.
1582701709|5.0|the cd and the book, \\"the secret\\" are great tools for building self-esteem and self worth, and keeping things positive.  Gave to my children as gifts.
0156027321|4.0|This is a great book, very different from the ones I've read. It is not packed with multiple characters of whom you have to keep track of. The story is simple yet offers a lot of food for thought through two main characters, Pi and a Bengal tiger. It tells a simple yet deep tale of a teenage boy stranded in the ocean on a small \\"boat\\" with a huge tiger and how they stay together and survive together. I especially love the ending. If you are a member of a book reading club, it offers some very good discussion topics and thoughts to ponder upon at the end of a book which can be even more interesting than the book itself.
B00079FUI6|2.0|in addition to all the other complaints ppl have made about this set, (dvd skipping, special features - incl. spoilers - on the first disc instead of being on it's own.. so as to not ruin the show for someone who hasn't seen it already).... it \\"currently\\" doesn't come with an episode guide booklet. i've bought this stupid set THREE times.. and returned it THREE times. 2 out of the 3 the packaging was crappy as well. (jewel casing coming off of the cardboard, broken disc holders - the discs kept falling out).. maybe they should rethink their marketing strategies, not to mention pay a litttttle more attention to product detail and quality. because whereas this is a great show, they're bumping down my enthusiasm about it with crappy products.
B000QFAJ7S|4.0|My December is a good CD. But it is no where near as GREAT as Breakaway. After all is said and done, i would still buy this CD, because it's Kelly Clarkson's! And i beleive that anything that she puts out has to have her approval, which gives me great hope for it.
0790729989|5.0|Long is the way, and hard, that out of hell leads up to light ...   [John Milton, Paradise Lost, Book II. Line 432]     \\"Seven deadly sins, seven ways to die\\" is the tagline for this intense psychological thriller directed by David Fincher:     ~ Detective Sergeant Mills [Brad Pitt] is set to replace Detective Lieutenant Somerset [Morgan Freeman], a world-weary cop retiring after years on the force. Somerset can see no end to the harrowing crimes he has witnessed, the sickness that is the City. Dealing with murder, rape, abuse, and poverty has become the Lieutenant's life and he now hopes for some small shred of peace. Mills, on the other hand, is new to the city; he is arrogant and brash, having little time for Somerset's thoughtful and analytical techniques.     As retirement beckons, so a new spate of killings begin. Like it or not, Somerset is given the investigation by the Captain [R Lee Ermey] while Mills is put on a different case. The murders are soon linked to the same killer - a twisted genius who chooses his victims based on the seven deadly sins in Dante Alighieri's 'The Divine Comedy' - and Mills and Somerset are paired together once more.     Despite their clash of personalities Mills and Somerset strike up a good partnership, Somerset's introspectiveness and Mills's self-confidence turning out to be a useful combination. Each one learns a lot from the other; indeed, Mills's wife [Gwyneth Paltrow] thinks Somerset is a good influence on the husband she is rapidly growing concerned about.     It soon becomes apparent that the 'sins' killer is playing a deadly cat-and-mouse game with the detectives, enjoying watching them either stumble or succeed at every turn in the case ... while he continues to kill according to the seven deadly sins: gluttony, greed, sloth, envy, wrath, pride, lust. They must stop him before he can finish his murder spree and most probably disappear forever ~     Se7en is not only the most accomplished film by David Fincher [Zodiac]but almost certainly - from a writing and directing viewpoint - the best psychological thriller in the history of film and television. There are none of the stereotypical clichés found in countless thrillers of violence, no room for the predictable, for the viewer is kept constantly in the dark until the very end. And the climax is both ferocious and awe-striking ... for once Hollywood kept the outcome a secret until the day of release, not an easy thing to do.     Whatever vision Andrew Kevin Walker had before he took his script to screenwriter David Koepp [Secret Window] was ultimately realized once in the hands of David Fincher. Fincher's dark and rain-driven sewer, his city of sins, has yet to be matched on film. His choice of cast was spot-on. Se7en is a true classic, crossing genres like crime, horror, thriller and police procedural ... dark and moody, harrowing and painful, Se7en will appeal to the darker side within us all.     Co-stars John C McGinley as California [captain of SWAT team]
0151013837|5.0|I had already read \\"Life of Pi\\" with great admiration for the way Martel managed to combine a tender philosophy of life with the tough reality of his story. I never, though, expected that it could be illustrated in a way which reflects the pleasure I had when reading it. The drawings by Torjanac are however above praise and made a perfect marriage with the text. This is the way a good book has to be presented, it combines excellent penmanship with  sensitive drawings and that all in a shape about which the publisher can be very proud. BRAVO!!
B000HT3Q3M|1.0|the performance on this album is below the standard that Benson and Al Jarreau are known and loved for. it is shameful at times the way their singing performance trails off or is out of tune on a particular track....i'm dissappointed.

0805079831|5.0|Ms. Klein has written a well-researched tome that will bear itself out in the upcoming presidential elections in 2008 and future generations.<br /><br />Milton \\"Uncle Miltie\\" Friedman wrote \\"Capitalism and Democracy\\" ironically the year I was born in 1962.  It was the promotion of capitalism and a critique of the so-called emerging welfare state: \\"The war on poverty\\"; government assistance/welfare that Reagan railed against evoking the \\"welfare queen\\" racist imagery.  Reagan was a Friedman disciple and he (Friedman) was his unofficial economic advisor during his 1980 presidential campaign.  It explains a lot.<br /><br />It explains why in 1980, I heard that freshman class had at the time, the largest number of African American males in a college freshman class (mine).  It was a legacy from the Civil Rights era and the efforts of pioneers like Rosa Parks, Malcolm X and Martin Luther King.  It was the beginning of neo conservative politics championed by Mr. Reagan... and Mr. Friedman.<br /><br />Ms. Klein further expounds on this brief history in the evolution of what she calls \\"disaster capitalism\\": the willful exploitation of calamities for financial gain.  As such a philosophy dictates, charity, mercy, even common decency cannot get in the way of the market's triumph.<br /><br />It explains why Wall Street can have a record day when \\"Main Street\\" pays $3.00+ at the gas pump along with rising heating and grocery prices.<br /><br />It explains why professional, white collar jobs must be outsourced in the US; in New Orleans with Hurricane Katrina and in Iraq.  Baghdad is no more sovereign and in control than New Orleans, and the mayhem that happened in Iraq; that happened in New Orleans was by design: without \\"disaster,\\" there can be no \\"capitalization\\" on the potential for profit from parasitic firms in such businesses.<br /><br />[[ASIN:0976297450 Unemployed: A Memoir]]<br /><br />If what she says is still correct outside of Atlanta -- a municipality with only four persons working for it and all other government functions outsourced -- it is a chilling prophesy of democracy in the US.  In it, like Jonah, I sincerely hope her predictions are wrong.<br /><br />The writing is well-reasoned, and the research impeccable.<br /><br />Her comments on \\"end-timers\\" paint all Christians unfairly as a crazed group of fanatics.  There were many prayers going up from the roof tops of New Orleans, and the African American Christian tradition is decidedly less hostile, less conquest-oriented than its European counterpart.  The oldest churches for the faith, contrary to popular views are on the continent of Africa: thanks to the Ethiopian eunuch (from Candace) and the Apostle Phillip (Acts 8:27).  However, her pointing out that this group feels there is no coming disaster they could not buy their way out of points accurately to a Eurocentric thesis.<br /><br />That this former Nobel laureate economist that started during FDR and the \\"New Deal,\\" eventually turning his back on it can still have this kind of influence 11 years after his death is testament to the staying power of an idea: and ideals, not reality is what neo conservatives run on.<br /><br />In this book, Naomi Klein runs on facts and realities.  This is her \\"shock treatment\\" and therapy for Americans since the elections in December 2000 and the aftermath of 9/11.

B00001OH7P|5.0|Let's see here... a concept album about a space-traveling soul man who tries to save the world with rock `n' roll? A collection of songs that take their cues from Chuck Berry, the Rolling Stones, and Flash Gordon? A drug-addled post 60s journey through rock `n' roll decadence that invites you to \\"freak out in a moonage daydream?\\" The ultimate glam rock album, then.    The Rise And Fall Of Ziggy Stardust And The Spiders From Mars is David Bowie's ultimate statement of purpose, a delicious and endlessly engrossing rock `n' roll funhouse mirror. The songs gleefully run the gamut from cocaine-powdered sleaze to hazy, beautiful balladry. Its acoustic and electric, cheap and soulful, decadent and moralistic, nihilistic and emotionally uplifting, comic and tragic, beautiful, hideous, and everything in between. It's the history of rock `n' roll condensed into one irresistible package, an entire universe held together by sheer force of will. It's also a hell of a good time.    Bowie assumes the role of the album's titular character, simultaneously celebrating and mocking the concept's strange extravagance. Just listen to \\"Lady Stardust,\\" with a beautifully, hilariously self-deprecating lyric soaring over a rafter-shaking white-soul melody. It works as both a tribute to and a satire of rock `n' roll myth, and it works brilliantly on both levels. But there's more to the album than just pastiche. \\"Moonage Daydream\\" is poetic, dreamy, and eternally memorable, with an incredible guitar solo thrown in for good measure. \\"Suffragette City\\" is a rollicking, ridiculously catchy, utterly irresistible sleaze-fest, and \\"Starman\\" is utterly hypnotic. \\"Five Years\\" is one of the most gorgeous, nakedly emotional love songs ever written, and \\"Soul Love\\" is just plain lovely. \\"Star\\" is an absolute sleaze-rock rush, and \\"Hang On To Yourself\\" features a classic sing-speak performance, plus a great guitar riff. \\"Ziggy Stardust\\" is simply one of the greatest rock songs ever (so, for that matter, are about half of the songs here), a clutch of brilliantly bizarre lyrics and haunting melodies. Great guitars, too. \\"Rock `n' Roll Suicide\\" closes the album on a suitably bitter, broken note. I even like the often-maligned cover of \\"It Ain't Easy,\\" in all of its folk-bluesy goodness.    It's one of the absolute classic rock `n' roll albums, and a great addition to any music collection.
B000TXNDUW|4.0|a Good remix of  an old chestnut. I  wish though the  sound had  been updated.
B00006JJ51|5.0|Yeah. So they were violent, misogynistic, racist, and homophobic. So they seemed to celebrate everything from drug dealing to cop killing. Since when do we have to agree with an artist in order to like their art? No matter how odious their message, N.W.A. were a brilliant band because they could describe such an outlandish lifestyle with clarity and unflinching brutality. Straight Outta Compton is a masterpiece because it's uncompromising and raw and aggressive, and because it grabs the listener from its first few moments and refuses to let go until the very end, because its best songs are absolutely irresistible and unforgettable.     Take the title track for example. It's a statement of purpose the likes of which you've never heard. Over a background of thundering electrified funk, rappers Ice Cube, MC Ren, and Eazy-E unleash a flurry of great lines, ripping your ears open to make sure that you can hear every word they have to say. It's raw and loud and brilliant. Seriously, I still get a little burst of joy every time Ice Cube thunders \\"AK-47 is the tool/ Don't make me act a motherf***ing fool!\\" After that comes \\"F*** The Police,\\" a pissed-off, brutal, and often hilarious rant against police brutality. \\"Gangsta Gangsta\\" is a stomping, darkly funny personal narrative with lines as immortal as \\"To a kid looking up to me/ Life ain't nothin' but bitches and money.\\" \\"I Ain't Tha 1\\" is righteously furious, and \\"If It Ain't Ruff\\" is smooth as hell. \\"Compton's In The House\\" is classic everybody-on-the-mic jam session, and \\"Dopeman\\" is just plain cruel.    So, it's just plain freaking great. Anybody who wants to know anything about rap outta have this.
B000PFUA9G|5.0|Bought this for my husband for one song - Online.  And, we both love the entire thing.  It's so refreshing to have a CD that you enjoy listening to from the beginning.  Maybe we are at the same point in our lives, but the songs are slightly nostalgic, often funny, peppy and fantastic.  This is great!  If you like Brad Paisley, definitely add this to your collection.
B000002KHH|5.0|Black Sabbath's second album is a big, mean, and downright dangerous slab of heavy metal mayhem, a tangled web of crushing guitar chords and apocalyptic vocals. The rhythms are pure, sludgy, crawling doom and the songwriting takes the scorched-earth dynamics of the blues to their logical extreme. In short, this is a heavy, cathartic rock classic.<br /><br />If nothing else, Paranoid home to three of heavy metal's most durable anthems- \\"War Pigs\\" is a protest song gone gruesome, a snarling anthem built around sledgehammer guitar chords and vicious lyrics. Meanwhile, the title track is a short blast of proto-punk anguish, with its rhymic guitar attack and vocals that sound downright, er... paranoid. Finally, \\"Iron Man\\" features the guitar riff to end all guitar riffs, pounded home by a twenty-four megaton drum attack and vocals that are a darkly hilarious throwback to the schlock-filled sci-fi comic books of old. Brilliant! But those ain't the only good songs here, no siree bob. There's also the monstrous \\"Fairies Wear Boots,\\" which features lead singer Ozzy Osbourne dueling with a howling tornado of guitars. \\"Hand Of Doom\\" is a creeping, crawling, oozing slice of drug-addled despair, while \\"Electric Funeral\\" is the sound of apocalypse pounding on your front door. And then there's the eerie space-out of \\"Planet Caravan.\\"<br /><br />From start to finish, it's a heavy rock `n' roll classic. Pick it up.
0618551050|4.0|I got this book because I had read a book about string theory before.  Now I don't know much about physics but this book was an interesting and easy read.
B000002OX5|5.0|The Who's third album is a classic ode to crass commercialism and teenaged popular culture, a colorful burst of psychedelic power-pop goodness, glazed with spiraling harmonies and raw guitars. It's like what would have happened if Andy Warhol had sponsored a rock band. Wait...<br /><br />Anyway, it's a fantastic record. The songs are among the group's finest, and they're held together by a concept that's brilliant in its simplicity: The album is designed to sound like a pop radio station broadcast, complete with station identifications and cheeky commercials. The whole thing works incredibly well. Too bad that real radio stations don't sound this good! I mean, today's airwaves could certainly benefit from more songs like \\"Mary Anne With The Shaky Hand,\\" a swirling, hypnotic pop confection with a dreamy rush of acoustic guitars, lulling percussion, and filthy, filthy lyrics. \\"Armenia City In The Sky\\" is a soaring psych-pop jewel, and \\"Sunrise\\" is a haunting acoustic ballad. \\"I Can See For Miles\\" is a swaggering rush of raw guitars and snarling vocals, while \\"Tattoo\\" is a hilarious tale of lost innocence and self-discovery. \\"Relax\\" features a way-cool organ part, and \\"I Can't Reach You\\" is spacey power-pop. \\"Rael\\" is a severely underrated, constantly shifting mini-opera, and \\"Odorono\\" is a hilariously catchy deodorant commercial.<br /><br />This is a classic of 60s pop, and one of the Who's greatest achievements.
B000FVNX2Q|5.0|This is an initial review, been using a few weeks, good device so far.  Instead of repeating everything said in other reviews, will just point out a few things:    1.  The case is actually really nice.  Yes, too big for your pocket like others have suggested, but frankly I find the calculator alone too big for my pockets.  At 1/2\\" thick at its thickest, it's not something I want to carry around in my shirt or pants pocket anyway.  Would rather have the nice, leather, magnetically closing case.  Only improvement would be to make a case like this that lets you use the calc without having to remove it.  Can't use 12c in this case, have to remove it.    2.  For hp 12c noobs like me, use [f][2] to change from the default decimal configuration of 1 to 2 (or however many decimals you want to see).  If you get a result with more decimal precision than the 12c is set to show (as in the examples on pg 25 of the manual), it will automatically round the result instead of changing the precision.  And info on how to manually change the precision was difficult to find in the otherwise superb manual.    Otherwise, quality device (never used the original 12c so can't compare), love the horizontal layout, all calcs should be this way.
B0001ZMWQO|4.0|Franz Ferdinand were one of the best bands to make it big during the post-Strokes Indie rock revolution of the early 2000s (i.e., now). They had all the right ingredients: tight, catchy songs with angular guitars vaguely funky rhythms, just the right combination of punk, dance, and pop influences, and a hipper-than-hip aesthetic that combined everything that was cool between 1975 and last month. As a result, their debut album garnered a heap of critical praise and great sales. And they say that good music doesn't get any recognition these days.    Here's the thing: Franz Ferdinand, although it may be derivative, and not exactly 100% perfect, is still a fantastic album. One of the shining lights of the past seven years, as a matter of fact. It isn't just that the songs are catchy or smart or ridiculously exciting (even though they are certainly all of those things)- it's that they breathe new life into the whole grimy, post-grunge, post-90s, post-O.K. Computer, post-everything rut that the mainstream had been stuck in. Just listen to \\"The Dark Of The Matinee,\\" the way it combines a lush, seductive vocal with a stomping, just-plain-raucous rhythm and elastic guitars. Listen to \\"Jacqueline,\\" to its slashing, apocalyptic guitar chords and hedonistic lyrics. Listen to the tightly meshed melodies and shape-shifting stomp of \\"Take Me Out.\\" And then there's the spastic cool of \\"Darts of Pleasure,\\" and the gorgeously erotic \\"Michael.\\" \\"This Fire\\" is an offbeat anthem.    As I said before, it isn't perfect. There aren't any truly bad songs, but after a while the album's formula does get a bit thin- it's hard to listen to this music for a full forty minutes without starting to feel like every song sounds like a slight variation on the one before it. That's not always a bad thing, but it does mean that the album tends to drag a bit in its last half, in spite of some truly inspired performances. Fans of alt-rock after Nirvana should love this.
0812932293|5.0|This was a wonderful book to read.  Richard Branson comes across as a very down to earth guy with lots of great ideas who makes things happen!  I was impressed with his love for his family and especially his wonderful and supportive parents.  Even his grandmother is inspiring!!  I can't believe how many risks he took with both his balloon rides and in his business ventures.  This book is a real page turner and I really, really hated for it to end.  Besides being a great businessman, Richard Branson really knows how to tell some interesting stories.  I highly recommend this inspiring and interesting book!
B000002ADT|5.0|Like any great work of art, Kind Of Blue transcends its genre. The record's soft, hypnotic textures and stunning emotional range should appeal to just about anybody who's listening, no matter what they think of jazz. It's a masterpiece of sustained mood and atmosphere, brimming with restrained cool and nervous energy. The group's playing is spare and beautiful, layered with a multitude of emotions, attitudes, and ideas. It's music that speaks to the thoughts and feelings that you've never been able to express, that brings to life your half-forgotten dreams and quiet longings. It's the record you would have made, if only you knew how.    All of which is my pseudo-intellectual, laughably pretentious way of saying that this album is wonderfully unique. It's dreamy; it's gorgeous and atmospheric. Its textures are lush and nuanced. The music epitomizes simplicity as a source of beauty- the arrangements and compositions are spare and open, giving each player ample room to express himself. Indeed, Miles' genius is in how large a canvas he creates, stripping the entirety of jazz down to a basic framework of scales and chords, and trusting his companions (a veritable dream team of middle period American jazz) completely.    The result is a masterpiece. The five songs here are among the greatest recordings ever made: \\"So What\\" opens the album with an incredibly smokey, soulful late-night ambiance, instantly evoking some sort of nightclub nirvana. Coltrane's solo is a thing of wonder. \\"Freddie Freeloader\\" is somehow both unabashedly passionate and a paragon of hip detachment. \\"Blue In Green\\" is simply gorgeous, and \\"All Blues\\" is full of tense, nervous energy. \\"Flamenco Sketches\\" is a dreamy, fluttering slice of atmosphere.    It's absolutely brilliant. No music collection is complete without it.
B0002WINF0|5.0|\\"To Kill A Mocking Bird\\" is so well represented in this editions packaging and extras, including print extras, I can only hope the buying power of AMAZON customers will demand another issue of this fine set. To whom it may concern: if this is in the works...Thank you in advance!
B000056VJ7|5.0|There aren't very many albums like Bat Out Of Hell. I mean, how can there be? Who else would think to create an intentionally bombastic, willfully ridiculous rock opera opus that turns teenage make-out politics into myth? What kind of damaged visionary would think it worthwhile to create a Wagnerian symphony out of something as moronic as a Lover's Lane triumph, complete with epic guitars, dynamic lyrical poetry, soaring vocals, synthesizers, multi-part songs, and tracks that last longer than seven minutes? And once someone actually decides to do that, who the hell would want to listen to it?    Indeed, Bat Out Of Hell could (and probably should) have been a disaster. I mean, if rock operas with serious subject matter and pressing themes are often (rightly) denounced as pretentious and over indulgent, what chance does this junk have? Well, here's the thing: this album succeeds where others have failed because it accepts, embraces, and feeds off of its own absurdity. Of COURSE it's all junk- that's the point!  By turning teenage palm sweat into opera, the album is both a satire and a tribute, a gloriously moronic celebration of everything we once held dear. It's stupid, and it knows it's stupid, and it revels in its own stupidity, celebrates it, honors it- and that makes it one of the least pretentious albums ever recorded. It would've done Johnny B. Goode proud.

B000VZBCWE|4.0|I think it's safe to say that 99% of the people who are familiar with Queen have already made up their minds about the band. Either you love `em or you hate `em, and there isn't much room for middle ground. Strangely, though, I find myself in that 1%, a `hater' who has slowly crept over into the `fan' category. Growing up in the `70s, kids had to choose between `glam' music or `rootsy' music. That meant that you could listen to Bowie and Queen, or Lynyrd Skynyrd and the Allman Brothers, but never both. I fell in with a crowd that worshipped southern rock, so Queen was verboten in my high school days. Remarkably, though, the band survived such prejudice. Queen even survived the punk onslaught, as this show from 1981 proves with a vengeance.<br /> An independent crew filmed \\"Queen Rock Montreal\\" in 1981, and the band was unhappy with the final results. This DVD is the result of the band claiming possession of the footage and restoring it to a state that meets their own exacting standards. If you are fan of Queen, the result is glorious. The band opens with \\"We Will Rock You,\\" and they definitely do just that. This live version blows away the bombastic studio/stadium version that is now abused by sports franchises. They then move through a series of album tracks, building momentum as they progress. Freddie Mercury is at his peak, which is a primary reason for this video being so valuable now. The entire band shines behind him, and the harmonies are fantastic.<br /> Here's a fun fact for the ignorant (like me); did you know that both Freddie Mercury and Brian May play piano with flair and grace? I did not, but the footage for \\"Save Me\\" displays them as piano-playing `switch-hitters', changing the piano seat to suit the song's instrumentation. It seems as if much of Queen's catalog is slipping into the ether, growing ever more forgotten as time passes. Other than the obvious hits, this material is rarely heard, so it is both entertaining and informative to see and hear the band tackle this wealth of material without straining to prove anything. Throughout the show, not one single bandmember ever acknowledges the presence of the camera crew, which is beneficial, leaving us with the impression that this is just another show with Queen on the road. The truth is different, and seen from today's perspective, it is plain that by any standard, this is not just another show. If for no other reason, you ought to see the video just so you can gawk at Mercury's outfit for \\"Another One Bites the Dust\\" - even Elton John would have blushed at that outfit.  The commentary by Brian May and Roger Taylor is extraneous and not particularly informative, so you can skip the 'special features'. Just crank up the volume and let the band rock you. Long live Queen!  A- Tom Ryantackle this wealth of material without straining to prove anything. Throughout the show, not one single bandmember ever acknowledges the presence of the camera crew, which is beneficial, leaving us with the impression that this is just another show with Queen on the road. The truth is different, and seen from today's perspective, it is plain that by any standard, this is not just another show. If for no other reason, you ought to see the video just so you can gawk at Mercury's outfit for \\"Another One Bites the Dust\\" - even Elton John would have blushed at that outfit.  The commentary by Brian May and Roger Taylor is extraneous and not particularly informative, so you can skip the 'special features'. Just crank up the volume and let the band rock you. Long live Queen!  A- Tom Ryan
0393327655|4.0|Harris offers us four very interesting assertions in this book. The book is structured around these 4 concepts which are not equally supported or defended.     The first assertion is that religious dogma and ideological practice has lead to terrible acts of murder and cruelty of one group against another for many years. He supports this assertion with lengthy discussions of the witchcraft hunts during the Inquisition, the Holocaust, and the recent clash between Islamic and western cultures. Most of the book is devoted to this assertion.     The second assertion is that religious moderates provide coverage and implicit support for religious fundamentalist extremists. Most religions are not self correcting in that they rarely allow moderates to exert pressure on extremists to bring them back into line with more tolerable moderate levels of belief and action.     The third assertion is that morality and ethical behavior need not be based on religion but can be based on philosophical ground.     The fourth assertion is that spirituality need not be based on ancient scripts and dogma but may be an internal state of being independent of organized religion and ideology.     These are all very interesting and Harris' first assertion is clearly supported by the historic record. His last two assertions are clearly supported by contemporary secular existence, particularly in the educated, the industrialized, and the middle classes of Europe and North America. It is his second assertion that moderates provide political and conceptual coverage for extremist that needed much more expansion and discussion and did not receive the expanded treatment that Sam Harris gave his other points.     At times I felt that Harris overstated or understated points. I particular, if mankind was not killing each other in the name of God, then mankind would probably be killing each other for a range of other racial, ethnic, linguistic, or resource allocation reasons.
B000FS9FCG|5.0|Based on a comic series by Alan Moore this one was supposed to be a 1984ish vision of the future but really how futuristic was it if you think about it? V showed a world with thuggish police, cameras everywhere monitoring your every move (it is already like that for real now in London), fabricated news stories and blowhard political pundits who worship government on the airwaves, religions used to control and manipulate the masses, artificial government created boogeymen and false flag terrorism, laboratory concocted diseases, torture in secret prisons. Sounds like the here and now to me and not the future.
B0002858YS|5.0|One of the best alternative rock albums of all time (including edgy radio rock from 1990 to today).  This album puts together a stockpile of hits and great melodies.  But even if it wasn't for the hits, it does so well that it puts albums of that year by similar artists Franz Ferdinand/Modest Mouse/Bravery/and plenty of others to shame.  Since then this group has kept up with a quite impressive catalog including another CD, a new rarities compilation, another hard-to-find rarities compilation, and many singles.  This band is getting better on stage and with the music videos as well.  Excellent!  Standouts, other than the entire record, to me are \\"We're On Top\\" and \\"Smile Like You Mean It\\".
B000Q6ZG6G|5.0|This was marketed to the masses as an opportunity to see Nicole Kidman naked. It was also an attempt to dispell all the gay rumors about Tom Cruise by putting him in sex scenes which ended up backfiring on them because those scenes were pretty flat as far as being \\"hot\\" so it just added fuel to Tom Cruise is gay fire. Even though I would imagine that he probably really is a homosexual I have to be fair to Cruise and say that Kidman doesn't exactly get the flames of lust going for me, she's a beautiful woman no doubt about that, but there is just something cold and icy about her. So you have to consider what he had to work with.<br /><br />There were also a lot of conspiracy theories and speculation about this film, which is the real reason it interested me. Three days after Stanley Kubrick turned over the final cut of Eyes Wide Shut over to the movie studio the thought to be perfectly healthy Kubrick turned up dead. People in his family initially said that they believed there was foul play involved and then shortly thereafter they mysteriously clammed up on the subject. If you've seen the movie then you know that the story is an overlap of the relationship between Cruise and Kidmans characters, and Secret Societies of the wealthy and well to do. The theory that many have is that Kubrick let out too much about how these groups operate in Eyes Wide Shut and was murdered for it. It is known that the studio totally redited and recut the movie after Kubricks death before they released it. Most of these filmmakers are agents and propagandists for the \\"illuminated\\" ones or powers that be or whatever you care to call them so they all are privy to secrets and modus operandi of those people. There is lots of occultic symbology in Kubricks past films. Especially 2001: A Space Odyssey, just find a copy of Bill Coopers radio show where he pointed out the occultic symbology in 2001. But I did see some of that stuff in Eyes Wide Shut, but not as much as one would have thought, which is probably due to the editing process that took place after Kubricks death. There is some symbology that were placed in the backdrops of certain scenes and more than that there was some very cryptic meanings you might be able to decipher out of some of the dialogue that had me raising an eyebrow but I don't know that this is what would have gotten Kubrick killed. I think it has more to do with how he showed how these secret socieities operate. Especially using sexual and other types of blackmail on people how they set people up and how people turn up dead of \\"overdoses\\" and \\"accidents\\" if they know too much or are thought to be possibly spilling the beans on certain information. Its actually pretty creepy that this was a focal point of the story when you consider what happened to Kubrick.<br /><br />A few other random thoughts of mine are both Kidman and Cruise are both under heavy mind control in real life through the \\"Church\\" of Scientology. The scene where a masked Cruise sneaks into the secret societies ritual is great. So was the music that was used throughout the movie. The scene where Kidman picks an argument with Cruise is unrealistic because that is not how anybody who is getting paranoid on pot acts. It does fit the behavior of a few nasty drunks I've encountered though.  Also to give some random Cruise information he is originally from my old hometown of Louisville Kentucky. His real name is Mapother. They are known as an \\"old money\\" family around Louisville. There are few well known attorneys and at least one Judge in this family. As far as I know Cruise never comes back to Louisville or has any interest in returning. After spending most of my life there I can relate to that entirley.robably due to the editing process that took place after Kubricks death.

B000001F9N|4.0|Donna's on fire on this platter of foreplay and deep dippin'.  Everytime i hear Donna's hot moans and groans and crys of passion during \\"Prelude to love\\" i want to tear my clothes off and grab my loved one so i can play dr.love.  Then i hear Donna telling me how we can make it if we try and then i start to ask who would not try for Donna???  You'd have to be a zombie not to want every part of that sizzling tasty body of Donna's.  Then i put on the sexy soulful yearning's of \\"Could it be Magic\\" and i think of Donna and I lying in a bed of whipped cream and chocolate as i eat my way to climactic paradise.  To get down to the nitty gritty, this album shows the hot sexy queen of sticky disco lust at her peak reaching orgasmic plateaus you thought weren't possible.  You can dance or make sticky sweet love to this platter of juice because it was custom made for that.  Sweet delicate sophisticated disco grooves diving deep into a hole of melodic ecstacy meshed in with a voice made out of honey and sweat.  I simply guarantee that you won't be able to sit when you hear this  manifesto of disco 69.  It'll give you a gusher of a time.    Oscar F.
B000UD0ESA|5.0|I had watched this a few times as teenager and loved it but I haven't seen it since. I'm very much into the idea of science fiction writers being agents of the new world order and using their works as a way to psychologicly condition people for what they have in store for us in the future. I have no doubt that H.G Wells, and Aldous Huxley were just that. With George Orwell its debatable whether or not he was a propagandist working for them, or if he was warning us about them. Either way he worked for them at one time writing war time propaganda for the BBC, as well as being active in Communist and Socialist movements in his younger days. So regardless he had gotten a glimpse into the belly of the beast so he was privy to inner knowledge. As far as Phillip K. Dick I don't think there's any evidence that he was working for \\"them\\" but I did pick up on stuff in Blade Runner that are reality today that I don't see how they could have known about back when this movie was made (was it the early 80s?) Like there's all this stuff with eye scanning for example. The public had no knowledge of this back then, but its real now. I haven't read any of Dicks books so maybe the eye scanning and other stuff was added to the film by Hollywood and not pulled from his stories. But anyway as far as the story itself and just being entertained I loved Blade Runner just as much as I did when I saw it years and years ago.
B000EGEVZK|5.0|I swore I would never buy another Ramones album (I guess I'm showing my age), DVD or book.  Been there...done that...bought the t-shirt (actually, several t-shirts over the years).  This set is a must have--vintage concert footage from the hardest working, best touring band ever.  The only downside is, when the music stops, the harsh reality that they are gone forever sets in.  R.I.P. guys and thanks for everything...
B00001QEE6|4.0|First off, this movie gets great marks from me and our 5-year-old. (Only problem is the ethnic stereotyping, particularly of the Siamese cats... oh, well, typical of older Disney movies).    But I cannot tell from product descriptions, and can only guess from reviews, whether they're referring to the 1999 DVD release or the later \\"platinum\\" release. This is a problem with many DVDs listed on this site.
0761536434|4.0|I'm a vintage game geek.  I loved video games from my first Magnavox home system, through my Atari, NES, up to my PS2. I grew up in an arcade at my local shopping mall.   I've not moved on to the current systems because life (mainly job and wife) kind of make growing up a necessity.  However I've always had fond memories for those early gaming years.  Now that you know where I'm coming from, it'll give a little background to my review.    This is a very well researched and written account of the birth and growth of the video game industry.  I've read this book cover to cover and truly did enjoy the in-depth history and annectdotes that is put forth in the book.  But I can't say enough how much I was really wanting this book to be THE definitive book on the video/arcade game culture.  That should include far more photos and captures from the games themselves.  This book lacks severely for photos at all!  The book reads a lot like a text book, but I think some re-formatting to something even like Jon Stewart's \\"America\\" text would actually benefit this book.  In fact, I'd be willing to pay the increased cost to have such a book.    That said, you will certainly come away from this book with a cool understanding of how the industry ebbed and flowed over the years.  If you are prone to setting down a book that is pretty wordy, you may want to think twice about this book, but know that you will be missing a lot of the inside story that connects so much from the past to the present.    Hope that gives you some good information to make an informed purchase.
B00005JPS9|5.0|Definitely look for \\"Beowulf\\" in 3D and IMAX, if you can.  It's even worth the extra $2.50 for a pair of 3D glasses. (Pass them off to your friend who keeps losing their shades afterwards)  The animation is so real, you're going to be ducking weapons, dragons, etc. Prior to this year, the last 3D movie I'd seen was \\"Space Balls\\" and I was singularly not impressed.  Of course, the technology has improved since then. Honestly, 3D is now so good people with serious visual challenges can see and appreciate the effects.    Why does one story get told over and over?  Revisited, retranslated, and reissued. Truth is, Hollywood often keeps redoing stories til they reach the zenith of the tale's capability.  If director Robert Zemeckis hasn't gotten there with this version, I'm not sure where they can take it. He's certainly improved on his 3D effect since \\"Polar Express.\\" (Which I still liked very much and saw twice in IMAX)     Most of us have encountered the tale before in an English class or two.  It's an anonymous poem taking place in about 500 AD, young Beowulf (Ray Winstone) comes to King Hrothgar (Anthony Hopkins) who his father owes a debt to and offers to settle that debt by killing Grendel (Crispin Glover), the monster who has plagued Hrothgar's hall. Of course, there's always more to the story--and that's what makes things interesting.      Neil Gaiman did an admirable job bringing the screenplay to life. The only other author I'd consider writing this tale for film would be John Gardner, who wrote \\"Grendel\\" in the 1970's; however, Gardner regrettably died almost 25 years ago.     The cast was stellar. Anthony Hopkins can play just about any king or faded hero and make them real. Angelina Jolie was at her wicked best as the temptress of kings and heroes. Crispin Glover just broke my heart.      The soundtrack was even good.  Too much music overscores the action.  The music rose at appropriate places and fell when we needed to hear something being said.      All inall, I'd give this effort a solid 5 stars.  It'll be a long time before anyone can rise to this cast and crew.  And please do go see this show at the theatre at the best screen you can find.
0060955775|5.0|I loved this book. It's simple and profound making you think about the way we live our lives and why many times we tend to suppress certain behavior because we are afraid of what people will think.  It's hard to say much more without giving away the content so I'll stop now.
B000VNMMQG|4.0|Ioan Gruffudd gives an invigorating performance as William Wilberforce, the sharp-witted, determined supporter of abolition in Amazing Grace, the true story of one man's struggle against a kingdom. With impressive performances from an equally impressive cast, this epic battle is one fought not with blood and steel, but of intelligent words and cunning linguistics. Brimming with intricate character development, pertinent morals, and thematic gusto, Amazing Grace is a period piece not confined by its period or the piece of history it so masterfully depicts.<br /><br />In 18th century England, William Wilberforce (Ioan Gruffudd) fought tirelessly in Parliament to end slavery and the slave trade throughout the British Empire. Amazing Grace chronicles his successes and defeats and also delves deeper into the life of the remarkable idealist and the events that shaped and influenced his extraordinary career. Forced to contend with debilitating illness as well as the ruthlessly powerful and deviously manipulative lords supporting the slave trade, Wilberforce overcame adverse odds and managed to construct a diverse and unexpectedly strong movement for abolition. Comprised of a flashback structure that relates his many tribulations, Amazing Grace also reveals a poignant tale of love, friendship, and the unending efforts that led to his monumental achievements.<br /><br />Based on the true story of William Wilberforce and his endeavors in Parliament to abolish slavery, Amazing Grace utilizes flashbacks to connect the arcing storyline that traverses several years nonsequentially. At once both an engaging courtroom drama and a whimsical love story, the carefully structured film remains assertively paced throughout and the mood is seldom as grim as its subject matter would expectedly afford. Combined with compelling characters and subsequently affecting character development, Amazing Grace boasts a surprisingly epic feel for a film devoid of any gladiators or soldiers dying on the battlefield.<br /><br />Though its themes are powerfully presented, Amazing Grace would not have achieved its pronounced conviction were it not for the overwhelming talent of its cast. Ioan Gruffudd magnificently portrays the brazen speaker with rebellious charm and heartfelt sincerity from his stunning accomplishments to his tragic defeats. Aiding him in his ceaseless crusade are Pitt (Benedict Cumberbatch) and Clarkson (Rufus Sewell) who both give strong performances; Pitt as a figurehead working behind the scenes and Clarkson as his resolute right-hand man. Michael Gambon effortlessly scene steals as the cynically droll Lord Fox, ever ready with his sharp tongue and comedically commanding presence. Albert Finney also turns in a bold portrayal of John Newton, the former slave ship captain who wrote the title song and sought forgiveness for his sins. The antagonistic Lord Tarleton (Ciaran Hinds) and Duke of Clarence (Toby Jones) add a refined touch of villainy to their characters, creating a far more satisfying conclusion when they finally fall to the band of ingenious heroes. Not a dull performance exists in this graceful drama, and even the rather expected love interest is handled refreshingly by the lovely Romola Garai.<br /><br />Perhaps a bit over sentimental at times, Amazing Grace still captivates with its diverse cast of exceptional talent, often movingly witty dialogue, magnificent recreations of 18th century costumes and sets, and the incredible true story of one man's unceasing quest for justice. Thankfully relinquishing any long-winded speeches, Amazing Grace allows the actions of the dauntless Wilberforce and his followers to do what they do best - speak for themselves.<br /><br />- Joel MassieThough its themes are powerfully presented, Amazing Grace would not have achieved its pronounced conviction were it not for the overwhelming talent of its cast.

B000EBD9TY|4.0|Most of the commentary had nothing to do with the scenes in the movie.  It was basically anecdotes from the play that had already been told on the bonus CD that accompanies the package.  I felt that Brando was the only one of the 4 cast members that deserved the Oscar yet he is the only one that didn't receive one.  Ironically, although we always hear about Brando mumbling, it was Vivian Leigh who was mumbling in which you couldn't understanding everything she said.  The movie is somewhat dated but worth a watch.
0060977493|3.0|I know I'll be unpopular, but I find this novel overrated. In fact, I struggled to keep up with the long-winded descriptions and narratives. Call me boorish, but isn't a novel supposed to make you want to read further. For example, consider this sentence (p19): \\"He put it somewhere between indifference and despair. He didn't know that in some places, like the country that Rahel came from, various kinds of despair competed for primacy. And that personal despair could never be desperate enough. That something happened when personal turmoil dropped by at the wayside shrine of the vast, violent, circling, driving, ridiculous, insane, unfeasable, public turmoil of a nation...\\" Sorry, lots of words. Period.

B000WGNLLW|5.0|This is unlike any other DD release. It's a fresh new sound that is very \\"radio ready\\". I have read a lot of reviews that call this release a \\"sell-out\\" but I think they simply wanted some airplay and a hit after Astronaut performed so poorly. (Though I can't see why because it's a BRILLIANT CD) The addition of Timbaland and Timberlake is apparent but I think there is something for everyone here. My fave tracks are: Skin Divers, Nite Runner and Falling Down. Great CD to put on at a party, I think it will get the guys back on the charts again.

B000EHSVSC|5.0|I have watched this movie several times. I know that many have had a difficult time seeing it once. This is not some great work of art. It is more like a docudrama of today's TV networks. The good thing about this movie is that it is a precise enactment of the events leading up to and including the bombing on Pearl Harbor and attempts to present as balanced a view as possible on the compulsions, motivations, fears and actions of both sides. One of the best war films I have seen. A must watch.
0440238609|4.0|** Parents beware!**    This trio of books is beautiful, magical, mind expanding. Pullman's creation of multiple fully-faceted worlds is spellbinding. Just beautiful writing, I'd recommend it for any adult/young adult.    That said: the central premise behind this fantastic chronicle is not something I would want my pre-teen child or younger teenager to be exposed to. It's nihilistic and heavily into materialist philosophy: exactly what kids today DON'T need.    For older teens and adults, highly recommended. For anyone younger (even tho the cover says this is recommended for anyone 8 to 80), definitely NOT recommended.    If you're thinking about giving this to a child (-14 or so), please read it first. Consider keeping your young ones' innocence for a few years. Teach them values, hope, and faith in something. Then the imaginative springboard that is Pullman's saga will be a good thing.
1567184855|4.0|I don't generally pay much attention to people who relate near-death or past-life experiences because, frankly, it all sounds like New Age mumbo-jumbo to me. Near-death experiences are, by definition, only NEAR death rather than the real thing, so any observations from someone who \\"came back\\" are inherently flawed. Past-life memories make a certain amount of sense to me since I believe in reincarnation, but they are also susceptible to current-life egos - like all those people who insist they were someone famous like Cleopatra.<br /><br />This, however, is something different. If Newton is telling the truth, thousands of people from very different spiritual backgrounds - from atheists to religious zealots - all give about the SAME DETAILS under deep hypnosis of what it is like in the spirit world. These details are far, far too specific to be explained as mere ego fantasies or coincidences, and since he claims to ask non-directive open-ended questions during hypnosis, the consistency of what he claims they report is startling. It's the CONSISTENCY OF DETAILS provided by thousands of unrelated subjects that is most persuasive for me.<br /><br />So, what it comes down to is the question of whether he is telling the truth about his work or just making the whole thing up. If he is not telling the truth and this is all a hoax, it is an extremely elaborate one that he has somehow managed to carry on for decades. His books have sold about 500,000 copies over the last 13 years, so critics have had plenty of time and reason to expose any fraud. Given the thousands of people he claims to have personally had sessions with since the 1970s, and given that he has trained other hypno-therapists who have used his technique on countless more people, it seems unlikely to me that he would be able to maintain such an elaborate hoax over such a long period of time. Although he certainly has his critics, I haven't been able to find anything on the Internet that actually debunks his research. IF YOU CAN, PLEASE LET ME KNOW. Until that point, I'm inclined to put my SKEPTICISM aside and assume that the session transcripts he includes in his books really happened.<br /><br />My SKEPTICISM is based on the following:<br /><br />1) As a PhD, he is very familiar with the rigors of academic research, so what's with the total lack of substantiation for his claims? If this isn't a hoax, his findings are monumental and deserve academic validation - independent reviews of session tapes, for example. If he can include transcripts in his books, he should be able to make the original tapes available for peer review. Anecdotal evidence is interesting for the casual reader, but doesn't really validate his claims.<br /><br />2) As a playwright myself who has struggled with writing dialogue, his transcripts don't sound very real. Perhaps that's because the subjects are in deep hypnosis, or because at the soul-level we all sound alike - or perhaps it's because he's just making the transcripts up as he goes.<br /><br />3) There are important areas he doesn't address in his first two books. I haven't read his 3rd book yet, so I'm waiting to see if he says anything about these areas. For example, how does shamanism fit into all this?<br /><br />4) Despite the above reservations, the way he describes the spirit world sounds very convincing to me. Ironically, it is so convincing that it makes me suspicious. If I were to create a hoax regarding the spirit world, his multi-tiered system of non-judgmental educational development is about how I would have designed it myself. In other words, I am suspicious of being seduced by a vision that is so similar to what I would have created if I had been intent on perpetuating a hoax. I realize this is a double-bind, but so be it.<br /><br />Despite my skepticism, I'm willing to take the leap of faith and say that, with reservations, this is what I believe. I still have some unanswered questions so this might change, but for now it's the best explanation I've heard thus far.<br /><br />If you are interested in knowing what he has to say, a good place to start might be a 30-minute interview with him that someone posted on YouTube.Com. Go to [...] and search for \\"Michael Newton between lives.\\" I'm not very good at telling when people are lying, Perhaps you are - in which case you cand decide for yourself by watching his video.<br /><br />Good fortunes to us all.terested in knowing what he has to say, a good place to start might be a 30-minute interview with him that someone posted on YouTube.Com.

B000Q9IZ5C|5.0|First off, despite coming late to it, I am a complete Browncoat.  I love the series, and love the film.  I bought this, despite owning the original release of the film on dvd, hoping for some spectacular extras.  That is NOT the case, sadly.  There are four additional items, and I haven't found a single easter egg.  The extras are nice, but why didn't they add the extras from the Australian edition, or all the stuff that they said they had to cut in addition to the cuts shown?  Yes, I'll buy the 'super-dragon-tiger edition' should it come out eventually, but for what is advertised as a great collectors edition, I was disappointed.  Though the packaging is shiny.

It even has variations of ribbing for the socks and many different patterns to knit. The socks are beautiful and there's tips for fixing common errors when knitting socks (e.g., gusset holes, socks that are too big, etc.) At the beginning, there is a whole section dedicated to the basics of knitting socks, like how to turn the heel and work the toe. This book was extremely helpful, and my socks are beautiful! A nice choice for anyone interested in learning how to knit socks.

I bought this CD knowing that there probably wasn't going to be anything new or groundbreaking on it, I bought it for my \\"inner teenager\\"; that thirteen year old kid who so much wanted to be \\"normal\\" and \\"acceptable\\" and yet somehow knew this was too much to ask.<br /><br />I bought it for that inner fifteen year old who had a perfectionist dad who wanted his son to have short hair and take an interest in school and to stop hanging out with those kids with the bleary red eyes and smelled of pot.<br /><br />I bought it for that scared and superstitious eighteen year old who bought into all the nonsense that somehow Led Zeppelin was associated with Satan and darkness and actually threw away all my vinyl recordings only to regret it the day after trash day.<br /><br />I bought it for that twenty-four year old who had some kind of \\"mystical vision\\" that all creativity...all art...all magic comes from a place/a space where the Invisble desires to become Visible and Led Zeppelin's music definiely showed me in a raw way that in order to stay sane, one must go over the edge.<br /><br />I bought it for the 42 year old man that I am now; a man who still can't believe he actually made it to see 42.<br /><br />I put it on the stereo and I turn it up. Every song has at least five clear memories associated with it. It's a musical time capsule and all the while I am creating new memories.<br /><br />I have a \\"whole lotta love\\" for this group who dared to go beyond \\"normal\\" and \\"acceptable\\" into territories that were dark, mystical, shadowy, and finally into a place of pure brilliance where the Invisible becomes the Visible over and over again and long after we're all dead and buried, their music will burn Holy Holes into the minds and souls of those who not only need a place to escape to, but a space where they can be in the world but not of it.<br /><br />It's a great collection and I love it and I love them.<br /><br />Peace & Blessings,<br />john, \\"the Light Coach\\"Peace & Blessings,  john, \\"the Light Coach\\"
B000UCEJEQ|5.0|Annie Lennox's gorgeous voice is a paradoxical blend of sadness and joy, frailty and strength, woe and wonderment.  Songs of Mass Destruction is a masterpiece that reflects Annie's talents as a vocalist, back-up singer, composer, and lyricist.  These songs will get under your skin and into your soul.<br /><br />The album begins gently, with \\"Dark Road.\\"  Simple musical accompaniment lets Annie's passionate lead vocal stand out, as she weaves a wistful, pessimistic yet hopeful message to a loved one.  The song builds in intensity, peaks, and ends calmly.  The next cut, \\"Love Is Blind,\\" is remarkably intense, with a rock vibe, superb back-up echoing harmonies, and an incredible conclusion with Annie repeating the words \\"so screwed up\\" six times.  \\"Smithereens,\\" a beautiful ballad that builds to a dramatic crescendo, is followed by \\"Ghosts in the Machine,\\" another driving rock song which is a blast to sing along with.<br /><br />\\"Womankind\\" features Annie harmonizing and singing back-up for herself, which is always a joy, and a rap from Nadirah X. \\"Through the Glass Darkly\\" is my favorite cut on the album, with a vocal that soars.  \\"Lost\\" begins simply and builds into a layered, rich drama. \\"Coloured Bedspread\\" is a paean to a blanket.  Why?  Why not!  This sounds very much like a Eurythmics track.<br /><br />\\"Sing,\\" the song to raise awareness for a treatment that prevents pregnant HIV positive women from passing on the disease to their children, has been discussed a fair bit by others here; it is fun to try to pick out voices of some of the other singers who offered their voices.  \\"Big Sky\\" is another vehicle for Annie to demonstrate the range, clarity, and power of her voice, and the poignant final song, \\"Fingernail Moon,\\" is a bit of musical harmonic heaven.<br /><br />I would urge those who did not get hooked on first listen to give the album a chance.  I've been playing it non-stop for days, and with each listen I discover new pleasures and new beauty.<br /><br />And finally, if you have the chance to see Annie perform live, you'll be amazed.  I saw her last weekend, and the performance was just incredible.  She has so much energy, and her joy in performing is clear.  And oh, that voice...o see Annie perform live, you'll be amazed.  I saw her last weekend, and the performance was just incredible.  She has so much energy, and her joy in performing is clear.  And oh, that voice...
B000002L68|3.0|I love 1999, Controversy, Sign O the Times, etc., but I don't like this album.  Prince sounds so stiff and soulless on \\"Purple Rain,\\" like Al Gore singing Ray Charles. Also \\"When Doves Cry\\" is just annoying.  A long drop from Little \\"Red Corvette\\" and the like.
B00028HBKM|5.0|Mel Gibson's The Passion of the Christ is one of the most powerful films that I have ever seen. Honestly, I really do not care about the various controversies surrounding the film... some say that Gibson's interpretation was too literal, some say that his film was a pendulum reaction to Da Vinci code where he has attempted to please the church, some have even said that the film is anti-Semitic. Honestly I don't care. I wept through most of this movie and I can't remember when I last did that (probably Schindler's List). Yes, it's bloody. But that's precisely what Gibson wanted to show... the sheer hell of the final hours of Christ. You have to own this because it's a movie that you will need to watch every now and again to remind us of the harshness of life when we start getting down with minor irritants in our everyday lives.
B000N3ST9I|5.0|This is for sure the best album money can buy!!  So go on, go get it. Freakin' awesome!!  Probably the best album 'till MH brings out the next one!
B00006JKOL|4.0|Ian Anderson really turned in a more acoustic direction with the release of Minstrel In The Gallery in 1975.  A very complex and rich set of compositions, one of my favorite Tull recordings.  The audio is excellent with this remastered CD (2002) and the bonus tracks are indeed a bonus.  Highly recommended.
B000001FS3|5.0|Every song in this album is a winner. If you must have one U2 album (CD) tthe Joshua Tree is the ONE. Bullet the blue sky is so amazing, as all their songs are.
B000J103PC|5.0|This brilliant film starring Meryl Streep and Anne Hathaway is just incredibly funny. The \\"terrible\\" Miranda Priestly (Streep) and the docile Andy Sachs (Hathaway) make for an odd couple. But as it turns out the winners and losers in life are not necessarily what the rest of the world deems them to be. There is a lot to be said for love, family and quality of life. At the heart of this hilarious movie is a serious message... it is far too easy to ignore our hearts and dance to the drummer's beat instead... but it takes much more courage to take the path less traveled because it also happens to be less glamorous.
1592332803|5.0|In all my years of baking (or cooking for that matter) I have never see a more beautiful and user friendly book. The layout is outstanding. The page stock is impressive, the colors and images outstanding. The book pages lay nicely when the book is open and the recipes are superb. You KNOW you are eating healthy foods and feel good about it. From beginner to experienced veg*n baker/cook, this book is for you. I simply cannot say enough positive about this book. Just look at it and you will know what I mean. Literally superb job Colleen! This is the standard others should shoot for in recipe books!! Very educational as well. LOVE IT
B000N3T0DW|2.0|You either like him or you don't like him...that is Almodovar.I have watched enough of his films to say finally that I do not need to have to see anymore of them to know that his films are not for me.VOLVER just simply left me flat.The film concerns itself with the small village mentality of Spain's women who superstitiously believe that their loved ones appear to help them after death.This is a very interesting theme,but Almodovar does nothing to make this at all compelling .After watching the DVD interview with Almodovar, I now understand that he ,through his films, is working out his life and his childhood.His films concern the women that influenced his childhood.That's all well and good,but I think the film is more cathartic for him than it is for me.Good for him,but I don't have to like it and I don't.This will finally be the last Almodovar film I see,unless he finally comes to grips with whatever his deal is with women in his life, and makes a more interesting film!!
0060776757|5.0|I thought I knew everything about the boys...guess not. Great book with the most amazing pictures. Any U2 fan will LOVE this book.
0099457164|5.0|Grisham is a gifted writer.  The story of the Broker is rich with Italian culture and history.  But more than that.  It is a story that builds interest and suspense with each chapter, slowly but steadily.  I look forward to the next book he writes.
B000UR9T8C|3.0|Here are the problems I had watching this movie (spoilers follow):    1. The best action sequence was the first one between Parker and Harry.  Although that ring should definitely have hit the ground... Plus, Harry takes a ton of punishment before the clothesline and fall that 'kills' him until he's revived.  Obviously he doesn't have any specifically supernatural abilities so it's odd that he can just hop on one of his dear ol' dad's contraptions and suddenly show lightning reflexes and an ability to bounce off walls at high speeds with little damage.  The real problem is pacing... the fight scene is a lot of fun, breathtaking at times, and nothing in the rest of the movie, even the climax, comes close.    2. Too many villains.  Three villains, three plot threads that all kind of messily combine at the end.  This makes for a movie that's too long but also too shallow.  Some elements occur too 'easily'.  For instance, Mary Jane's going along with Harry when he blackmails her.  She knows that Peter's Spiderman and can take care of himself.  Why does she just give in?  The Sandman's family and his interaction with them at the beginning was interesting, but he by the end of the movie you forget all about them.  Venom and Sandman become partners way too quickly, and then Sandman just as quickly does an about face for no apparent reason.  And why does Harry's butler take so long to tell him 'the truth' about his father?  And for that matter, what _was_ the apparation of Harry's father  that appears to Harry throughout the movie?  Was it all in his mind?  And why does Harry so quickly change sides?  Just because dear ol butler contradicts dear ol figmentary dad?  Seems a bit too convenient.  The writers made events which should have been relatively complex for them to have any believability into events that happened way too quickly.  Sandman suddenly having a change of heart was the only way they could have ended the movie without him killing Spiderman, since it was obvious he was indestructible to anything used on him (water?  he'll escape... turn him to glass? nope, he'll come back).    The pacing was just wrong throughout the story.  Nevertheless it was entertaining, even if it had giant plot holes.  Certainly a decent movie to watch when you don't feel like thinking all that much.
032147404X|5.0|I have it. What I like about it is it gets straight to the point. You want to learn about how to take a certain type of photo? It tells you how to do it. It's like a recipe book for getting specific types of photographs that you want. The binding in the book could be better, but that's a manufacturing issue, not a content issue. For content I give it 5 stars. For the book binding (or lack therof), 2 stars. (Mine started falling apart the 3rd or 4th time I leafed through it, unfortunately.)It's still worth having, though, for those times when you know what kind of shot you want and have no idea how to get. Great for beginner DSLR users.
B000YMBBH0|5.0|Excellent high def picture and audio quality with a ton of interactive extras exclusive to HD DVD.
B000P2A256|3.0|I had no preconceptions coming into this CD. Whilst I liked moments from there precious CD [[ASIN:B00006879E Songs About Jane]], and that CD grew on me, in time, I waited quite awhile to pick up this CD. But pick it up I did, and, to my ears, it's a mixed bag. The sublime moments mentioned in my title would include 'Makes Me Wonder' (which I think was the first single) and is a perfect mix of funk & Rock, 'If I Never See Your Face Again, 'Wake up Call' & 'Can't stop'. Seeing that funk resonates more with me than straight out Rock/pop, so the rest of this CD doesn't move me as much. For these songs listed I'd give this 3 stars.
B000002513|5.0|To rate this album anything less than a full five stars is ridiculous!  This album is genious on so many levels, from the deep, thoughtful lyrics, to the amazing music arraingments; jazzy/bluesy/hard heart pounding rock & roll.  There is no better one-two punch than Incident on 57th and Rosalita!  Well, okay, maybe Born to Run and She's the One :).  Kitty's Back is the best roller coaster ride you'll ever go on!
0743486285|4.0|Amazing story, just amazing.  Also a very cool way to tell the story: you read the diary entry, you get his comments from today's perspective and you also get commentary now from the people who were around him then.  Very much a retrospective on a totally decadent and wasted (no pun intended) life...
B00005614M|5.0|This is simply beautiful music;<br />fresh from the be-bop academy of Charlie Parker, Miles Davis has finally proven himself as an carismatic leader...<br /><br />Having spent some time at Julliard and (according to his own autobiography), having studied some classics of the classical western music, Miles also drew from some earlier interesting models of jazz arranging  - Claude Thornhill is mentioned most of the time, but young Gerry Mulligan has heralded this style even in some arrangements for Gene Krupa's big band (not to mention some of the \\"advanced\\" tracks by Henderson, Ellington and other classical bands).<br /><br />This is therefore a beautiful blend of the be-bop musical language and more subdued and subtle arranging (\\"neo-classical\\"), creating a genuine and very influential cool breeze that will influence future cool and west-coast jazz artists. Gerry Mulligan seems to be the best arranger of the album (although Gil Evans is also excellent), while Miles, Mulligan and Konitz give the most inspiring solos if you want my humble opinion...<br /><br />Well, since other have put it so eloquently, I'll only add my 5 stars...<br />Naturally, if you liked [[ASIN:B000002AH6 Porgy and Bess]]  or [[ASIN:B000002AH7 Sketches of Spain]][[ASIN:B00003XAQ6 Sketches Of Spain]] you're bound to love this as well...
B000X9PNOG|4.0|The mighty voice rip-roars through the songs from the Bat trilogy with all the power of a jumbo-jet tearing down a runaway and blasting into a hell-raising takeoff. Here is another Meat Loaf performance that goes far enough to make the original studio recordings sound timid (listen out for \\"Objects In The Rear View Mirror\\", \\"Rock and Roll Dreams Come Through\\" and \\"Bat Out Of Hell\\").    \\"Rock and Roll Dreams Come Through\\", \\"You Took The Words Right Out Of My Mouth\\" and \\"Blind As A Bat\\" are amongst the songs to have segments missed out - pity that these songs are 'incomplete' when they are sounding this good. It doesn't really matter that Meat Loaf doesn't always hit the notes like he once did or that he survives the chorus of \\"Blind As A Bat\\" with the help of a backing track because what he does sing, when he really goes for it, is all there.    I saw this show when the tour arrived in London, England by which point \\"Paradise By The Dashboard Light\\" had found a few great gags and \\"I'd Do Anything For Love\\" had a franticly awesome new opening arrangement (all of which are not present for this show). John Miceli's drum beats are pure rock, delivered like an earth quake bulging through an intravenous drip. The cover songs at the end are fine, but if Meat had the energy (and he does) it would be nice to hear him perform his own classics, after all, he has plenty more of those that aren't included on here. The show is superbly filmed and includes plenty of sweeping camera angles and a feeling that you're up on the stage next to him. It's this intimacy that helps give this DVD an edge over the Melbourne Symphony Orchestra DVD.    Where the show flounders is where the lead female vocals come into play, and they come into play frequently. Sure the girl can sing, but she isn't Patti Russo who, after 13 years, Meat Loaf appears to have unforgivably replaced in favour of a 'newer model', prior to the release of Bat Out Of Hell III, and a mistake that no amount of on-stage pyrotechnics can compensate for. Maybe Patti Russo was just too good. Russo is why I'll favour the Melbourne Symphony Orchestra DVD, and her absence here is my main reason for giving this DVD four stars and not five.    The bonus DVD is a fly on the wall documentary of the few weeks leading up to the show in London, Ontario and compliments Disk One perfectly. We see Meat rehearsing, driving his car, packing his suitcase, preparing for shows and collapsing from exhaustion after them. You might be disappointed to see this towering rock legend reveal enough of himself to make us realise how 'un-star' like the man behind the Meat Loaf character is: quiet, reclusive and fragile. It is a documentary that is in essence about the road leading up to the show on Disk One, and as for Meat Loaf himself - we are left little the wiser. Even his autobiography was told in glimpses. It does leave you realising that perhaps the on-stage and off-stage personas couldn't be flung any further apart.    The king of rock crown isn't leaving Meat Loaf's head (even if the king is missing his queen). Frankenstein has no hope of ever recovering this overweening creation.
B00004XQ83|4.0|On Amazon's MP3 downloads I found many, MANY versios of the movie songs I wanted - \\"Constant Sorrow\\", and \\"Jailhouse Now\\".  A version of \\"Jailhouse\\" by the Memphis Jug Band from the 1930's is a real hoot with very different words from the movie version - do yourself a favor and check it out.  The movie version is also well covered.
B00005O5CM|5.0|Witty and smart is how I'd describe this movie. I'm a big fan of Reese Witherspoon, so she's an added bonus to this movie. I saw this movie once and fell in love with it so I had to buy it. It's so funny and cute at the same time. Definitely a movie to see!
0739302752|2.0|I think that there's gold in this book. But it's awfully hard to listen long enough to find it. It's read by several people: the co-authors plus a professional? They cut in at various points and take up the monotone. Oops, monologue. Curiously, the co-authors are better than the professional?<br /><br />There are 2 kinds of business books, from what I can tell. One type, like \\"Good to Great,\\" takes data, and conducts research to spot keys to success. This book takes two successful people (better than one, I guess) and lets them tell why they think they were successful. No real testing outside of th authors. So let's call this a biography, with lessons that hopefully will apply to you.
B000S0GYRU|3.0|I've read a lot of rave reviews of this classic film by Italian filmmaker Dario Argento. And I bought this 2-disc special edition at the mall recently, simply because of its reputation. After all, Entertainment Weekly rated this film #18 out of the top 25 scariest movies of all time, and said it had \\"the most vicious murder scene ever filmed.\\" But just like a lot of the other so called horror \\"classics\\", I feel that this film is a bit overrated. Not to say that this is actual \\"bad\\" film, but what exactly separates this film from all the others? Its certainly don't think its the story. Though the main plot isn't bad, there's nothing real special about it. The story is about an American dancer who arrives at an European dance school and has odd occurrences begin to happen to her, including disappearances/murders of fellow students. Later she finds out that the school is simply a front for a coven of witches who practice a diabolical black magic. Again, not bad for a story, but nothing amazing about it either. The acting is not terrible; Jessica Parker does a decent job with the lead role as the American dancer, but there are really no stellar performances here. Now, as far as the \\"most vicious murder scene ever filmed\\" that happens just minutes into the film, I gotta say I was somewhat disappointed in it. It wasn't nearly as graphic as I expected, and the blood look a bit fake (it was too bright). Nevertheless, the scene was done pretty well, with some good suspense. With this opening scene, the film did fool me a bit. I thought it was going to be more of a slasher film than anything, but turns out, its not. The special effects weren't nothing great, again, my biggest complaint was the blood being way too bright in color. As well as the body count being fairly low, which I suppose really has nothing to do with this type of film since it isn't a slasher film or anything, but thats something that I do look at when rating horror/thriller films. Now as far as the strong point in the film, its got to be the atmosphere, lighting, and overall mood of the movie. This is something that Argento did exceptionally well. The soundtrack to the film is creepy and dark, the unconventional lighting, mostly bright red and blue, are really good as well as some great camera angles. But I feel that in some parts of the film where the story bogs down a bit, the mood and atmosphere try to carry the movie by itself, which really doesn't work. Yes, I think the overall feel of a movie is very important, but there has to be some substance to it as well. And I just feel that the overall story doesn't match intensity with the mood at most times. Again, like I said before, I'm not saying this is a bad movie, believe me. But I'm not sure why this film is so highly praised by some people. Perhaps after a couple of more viewings, I'll see what some of you are talking about. Meanwhile, I do recommend watching this movie to any horror fanatic, however, I would suggest to watch it before you buy, unless you find it fairly cheap to purchase.oint in the film, its got to be the atmosphere, lighting, and overall mood of the movie.

B000V8I2QU|3.0|sounds like old Bruce, but maybe a bit too much so. Often the songs remind you of an old Bruce tune. Not a lot of diversity, but an enjoyable CD.
B000V6BE6C|5.0|This cd rocks! it is a great follow up to city of evil. great job you guys!
B000I2J2W2|5.0|I will admit I was a little nervous about the treatment one of my favorite scifi flicks would get in it's HD DVD release. I am here to say Job well done! The restoration and HD transfer are flawless, It's a testament to the skill of the original matte painters that their backgrounds hold up so well under the glare of HD. The special features, especially the Robbie one are first rate. The only problem I had was with the remastered sound. I had never noticed how complicated the electronic 'score' was but now you can hear every sound clearly. My problem? There were a couple times when it could have been a little lower in relation to the dialog track. Other than that nit picky complaint I am beyond pleased.
B000VLE3GA|5.0|I give this a five star rating just for the sonic improvement over the original single CD's and the 'remastered' box sets from the early 90's.  I hate to admit it but I would buy all the single titles again if they were all released with the improvement in audio quality that this title has.  I personally would've released a 3-disc set so a few more of my favorites could've been included but for a newbie this sums up ZEP pretty decently.  One question though I hope somebody can answer for me.........why does the guitar intro to \\"Babe, I'm Going To Leave You' start in the left channel on this release but on the right channel on both the original CD and the Box Set?  I'm confused, which is right?  I don't have the original LP anymore to compare it to.    Update Nov 18th....About my comment above on the mix of \\"Babe, I'm Going To Leave You\\".   This left-right thing appears to have something to do with the way I-Tunes encodes to MP3, 256 Khz.  The CD itself when played on my regular stereo starts with the guitar intro in the right channel, not the left like the ripped copy.  Now I'm even more confused, I wonder how many other songs have been 'flip-flopped' by I-Tunes?  Oh well, it still sounds very, very good and is a recommended buy.
B00005JPLW|5.0|I saw it first in the theater, (IMAX, no less) and knew almost immediately that--oh yeah--this girl's getting the DVD!  Not just for the obviously hot Gerald Butler, but the groundbreaking visual effects (I'm stealing the 'Oracle dance' for a video I want to do) and just the the sheer and surprising visceral joy I got from watching the movie.  I'm no stranger to violence in \\"sword and sandal\\" movies but I will say I appreciated the hyper-stylized violence, even in the more grittier scenes.  I find myself watching it over and over and completely thrilled with this ancient world \\"special forces\\" almost manga-type story.
B000UFAURI|5.0|I generally like most of the Foo Fighters songs on past CD's. This CD is great one to add to any collection. I like every song on it and the more I listen to it the more I like it. It has slow melodic tunes and some, not as full wide open as in years past tunes but all the songs are good. It's rare these days that a CD comes out that is good all the way through. I can envision at least 4 or 5 tunes hitting the airwaves in the near future. A solid effort to say the least.
0803730470|5.0|My two year old daughter and I absolutely love to read Julia Donaldson's books.  We love the way the book flows it is almost lyrical.  The illustrations are beautiful too!
B000W1V5VU|1.0|This is the grainiest DVD I have seen in a long time.  Do not buy this piece of junk.  It looks like they crammed too much on a single layer DVD where they needed a dual layer.  Buy the Blu-Ray or HD-DVD version, but don't buy the DVD!!!  Very disappointing.
B000669GAI|5.0|This is just a great compilation of tunes by the best grunge band of all time.  Kudos for Eddie Vedder & Co.
B00005JPRD|5.0|I have never seen anything that depicts the 60's better than this film. It was a rerun of my life. All the intensity, passion, purpose and fervor are portrayed beautifully. My 19 year old daughter drove from Portland to Seattle to see the premier then the next weekend insisted I go back up to Seattle with her to see it. I've seen it twice since then and love it more every time. I can't wait for it to come out on DVD.     Read the review written by \\"Happy Camper.\\" I agree whole-heartedly with everything said.
B000RMQH30|4.0|If you've been around for a while, these songs sound slightly familiar to 1970's combination of rock, blues, and soul music. But that shouldn't detract you too much from giving this CD a few good listens, before you make up your mind about it's quality. After all, good music is still good music, and sometimes going back in time is a good thing.
B000VLE3GA|5.0|I had to review this timeless work, a true master piece and a sheer genius work of art in music and sound reproduction! After reading some really aweful reviews and seeing that such a Great work is not getting its proper appreciation, I had to say something. This is such a huge leap in the advancement of sound remastering, that you would have to be absolutely deaf to not to realise it and appreciate it! These two CDs are like the masters of all masters. The GOLD CDs of all GOLD CDs. The difference is like Day and Night! My four year old could spot the diffs. I am really sorry for those people, who don't recognize it and value its true merits. I suggest you guys please get your Ears cleaned and checked! A thorough exam should be in order!     Let me tell you how BIG this reincarnation is: For the first time we (rare breed of course) the audiophile and/or true Zep fans alike, who don't listen to LED ZEPPELIN only on their mediocre iPod or from the downloaded crappy no quality MP3s, can enjoy or relive the true experience of this everlasting Sonic Phenomenon AKA. LED Zeppelin! Now you can represent this music to your offspring and the upcoming generations and prove that you were not crazy all these years when you loved and endeared a band not like any other bands in the history of Rock and Roll.     Every song in these two CDs is so vivid and vibrant that you get goosebumps for every note played and every sound reproduced. I could not believe my ears! It was like listening to the LED Zeppelin in your own studio while they recording the songs just for you and you are listening them LIVE and for the first time and falling in love with the music and the sweet sound and the melody of every note played, all over again! For years I thought that I could only hear that kind of sound in my Record Player. Yes, I am one of the rare breeds who still owns a record player and collected every vinyls ever produced by the Led Zeppelin. CDs were supposed to bring more Dynamic Range andrealism to the sound and the music but what we had all these years are the washed down version of Super Genius work of art. I could not stand the CDs that were released. However, that did not stop me from buying the CDs. I bought every release hoping someday it will come out right. Well my patience finally paid off thanks to everybody who worked on this project and has made the band immortal for all the generations to come.     This compilation is to all the Audiophile's dream come true and prayers fulfilled, as some other reviewer said a true GODSEND indeed! Normally you would pay Ten or Twenty times more to get this kind of recording and remastering. If you are a true fan and audiophile you will definitely buy this set. If you are just another cheap downloader or iPod listener you will just utter non-sense to justify that you are right and everybody else is wrong. Well, let me tell you something. \\"Grapes are always sour\\" to those who never had them or can't have them.
0767800958|2.0|Sally Potter snatched defeat from the jaws of victory in \\"The Tango Lesson\\". I had high hopes thanks to \\"Orlando\\". The film began well and sank under its own weight very quickly, that not even the genius of Pablo Veron could rescue.<br /><br />Dance movies are not for those looking for a strong plot. Nor are musicals. More joy would have gone a long way here. Instead there is a nagging low-grade fever of sourness.<br /><br />There are bald references to the Nicholas Brothers, and Fred and Ginger, but these are different days. And if you are going to swipe from either of them, as she did, then go for broke and burn down the house with it.<br /><br />The camera is unflinching, and Potter looks gaunt and weary throughout the black and white proceedings. Of course this fits into the bi-continental story line.<br /><br />In the end, if you can project your notions on the film, study Veron, and let Sally go forth, you'll be OK. Otherwise I'd consider this a disappointment, but not the incompetent debacle of \\"Tango Assassination\\".
B00005JNBQ|1.0|...and I say that as someone who has actually written bad comedy for a living.  There is an art to deadpan, but this wasn't that.  It felt sado-masochistic to me.  Like I would be tortured by a bad film until I sadistically started laughing at the brain dead, class \\"retard\\".  Bleh.     There are a lot of funny movies out there, this isn't one of them.  Bleh again.  Bleh, bleh.
061891868X|5.0|I have to say I am now completely confused - for a long time I thought the string theory is nearly ready and there are just a few tweaks to make it work. After reading this book, I realized that the string theory may be a great hoax and we are as far away from knowing how the universe works as we were in 1980's. Thank you Mr. Smolin for opening my eyes!
B000V1Z8KK|5.0|Although I'm not nuts about Mark Walberg personally (he blinded a man in a racially motivated attack as a young man) he can surely act.  He does a great job in this non-stop action flick.  He doesn't carry the whole load here, however.  The director should get top shelf billing.  And Danny Glover plays a really detestable bad guy.  It was beautifully staged.  I loved it.  I'd watch it again.
B000UGG39Q|4.0|Great southern-style metal.  Not quite as much soul as on the last 2, but very good.  I get the chills from the lyrics to \\"On March The Saints\\".  Given the origin of this band, I think a few of you will understand: NOLA.
B000OYC7A8|4.0|Excellent, no doubt. For those who are thinking...\\" another DVD again!...\\" well I can tell them this is a very good production. You will not waste your money. Good imaging quality and magnificient sound.  The only little problem that I noted and also I read from other customers is the fact that at some point you will see briefly the movie \\"frozen\\" and then it will continue. This happened to me in my computer but I did not notice it when I used the DVD player. That's why I give 4 stars and not 5. In other words 5 for the concept and the art, 4 for the technology.

B000VNMMQG|4.0|This movie tells the story of William Wilberforce, an English Christian and politician who fought for the abolition of the slave trade in the British Empire in the 18th. century.  Plagued by physical ailments and political enemies, Wilberforce worked with clergymen and like-minded politicians to outlaw the dehumanizing slave ships which had plagued both Britain and Africa.  His close friend, William Pitt, became Prime Minister and the two teamed up to oppose the slave traders.  The movie is well-made and well-acted and will serve as an education to many about the inhumanity to African captives during this difficult period in history.
B000BC8TBE|4.0|Only reason I give this a higher score than the original is for the DualDisc videos. I paid 11 bucks for this and overall, am satisfied with the 5 outstanding tracks on it.<br /><br />All I Want For Christmas Is You (Best X-Mas song ever. Made Me tear up twice! No other songs do that!)<br />Christmas (Baby Please Come Home)<br />Miss You Most (At Christmas Time) Lovely. The second best song here. It's so sad.

B000MGUZM0|4.0|This is a pretty good follow-up to \\"Funeral\\", which set a standard so high it would have been almost impossible to reach.  It took me quite a few listens before I started liking this record.  Initially, the catchier songs sounded too obvious and too familiar to be real.  Am I the only one who thinks \\"Keep The Car Running\\" sounds like \\"On The Dark Side\\"?  I guess I just didn't know what to expect.  Some reviews of \\"Funeral\\" described it as bombastic, especially the vocals (in a positive way).  I think \\"Neon Bible\\" loses some of the bombast and energy but succeeds in the mood setting that \\"Funeral\\" succeeded in, and its overall sound is concise and direct, but less playful.

0684853523|4.0|\\"On Writing\\" is a memoir of Stephen King's writing life. Part autobiography and part advice, King shows us how he formed as a writer and tells us how to be a writer -or at least how he does it. This is a personal exploration of the craft of writing written while King's own literary life was imperiled. The book was completed while he struggled to recover from a near-fatal accident in 1999 and concludes with his account of the incident and resulting debilitation, underlining the significance of writing in his life.<br /><br />First, King gives us his \\"Curriculum Vitae\\", 38 memories of what formed his writing life and career, from early childhood, through teenage years awash in rejection slips, the excitement of selling his first novel \\"Carrie\\", to struggles with drug and alcohol dependency and beyond. Then he offers \\"everything I know about how to write good fiction\\", based on the belief that it is possible for a competent writer to become a good one if he or she pursues the craft with passion and diligence.<br /><br />King presents us with a writer's tools -vocabulary, grammar, and style, shares his ideas on what attracts readers to a story, explains a novel's three elements -story, description, and dialogue, opines on writer's courses and plotting, talks about his own books, and offers some tips on getting published. King's advice is customary: Read a lot, and write a lot. Avoid adverbs and passive voice. 2nd draft = 1st draft -10%. But King speaks from the heart and from experience. \\"On Writing\\" is an enjoyable lesson on the craft of writing even if you're not a writer.
B000WQ9UA8|1.0|This album and the supposed \\"singer\\" are exactly the epitome of what's wrong with popular culture and our infatuation with dumbtard celebrities and their fake attempts for stardom.  This album is irrevelant in terms of artistic merit.  Sure its been getting fairly subtle reviews, but the reality is that albums are based on product, not the talent or use of technical wizardry that are used for an outcome.  The package as an album is actually a great listen.  The BEATS (AND I MEAN ONLY BEATS) are amazing innovative but suffer immensely due to SPEARS lackluster vocals.  Her voice is as robotic as ever and i'm left to wonder why noone cares to realize that this \\"singer\\" is indeed not \\"singing.\\"  I'd rather listen to BRITNEY talk retarded (as she usually does on camera) then to listen or see her fake no talent exterior.  The stand out song, GIMME MORE isnt even doing much for Britney's already flopping album and the odds of a saviour track are slim.. This album is arguably a good listen but I just cannot merit this worthy of 5 stars for the mere fact that she isnt a \\"in-control\\" artists or talent, she is not deserving of any of that!  It disgusting and embarassing that she is even \\"singing\\" nowdays.. I suggest true talents, ALICIA KEYS, MARIAH.. or just anyone who actually sings will do!  This girl is just fake and untalented, she cant even coreograph her own dance moves.. She doesnt write-produce and when she does write, the results are floptastic! (when she takes charge of her career, you get horrible results)  Gimme more video shoot is just a great example at why she should always rely on other's for her limited talent.  With GIMME MORE VIDEO, she chose the DIRECTOR, SHE CHOSE THE DANCE-ROUTINES (THE DREADFUL POLE-DANCER WANNABE) SHE CHOSE THE OUTFITS, EVERYTHING WAS BRITARDEDS IDEA and the end result is 100% Britney.. Dreadful.. Buy this album only if you want to waiste your money, otherwise just do yourself the favor and listen to true REAL MUSIC!      I hope JIVE listens, we want \\"BLACKOUT\\" INSTRUMENTALS please!
B000W1V5VU|3.0|\\"Ocean's Thirteen\\" is better than the abysmal \\"Ocean's Twelve\\", but this is another exercise in panache from Steven Soderbergh and all-star company with limited entertainment value. Danny Ocean (George Clooney) and his gang plot a revenge job this time. Mentor Ruben Tishkoff (Elliot Gould) has been swindled out of his share of a dream Las Vegas hotel by business partner Willie Bank (Al Pacino). The gang intends to compel Bank to restore Reuben's share by making the hotel's Grand Opening go very wrong. If they can cause the casino to lose money, Bank will default on his loans. And if they ensure the hotel won't receive a 5-star rating, Bank will be humiliated.<br /><br />To call this plot flimsy would be generous. \\"Ocean's Thirteen\\" is a series of disjointed conversations and glamorous sets. It jumps from one person or place to another with little reason. The point seems to be mediocre one-liners and a striking color palette. Soderbergh fills the screen with oranges and cerulean blue. Most scenes could have been left out. The crime itself is dull as dishwater, an unforgivable fault in a heist movie. But all the frenetic editing and meaningless scenes left me to ponder the fabulous colors. The production design and lighting earn all 3 stars. \\"Ocean's Thirteen\\" is a 2-hour fractured vignette of a fantasy Las Vegas. Cutting a half hour would have helped.<br /><br />The DVD (Warner Brothers 2007): Bonus features include some deleted scenes and 2 featurettes. \\"Vegas: An Opulent Illusion\\" (22 min) is an interesting documentary on the evolving culture, architecture, and economy of Las Vegas. It interviews an architect, casino host, owner, and others about the Strip's constant reinvention, the lure of casinos, the lifestyle of high rollers, and the current transition from mega resorts to design-oriented architecture. In \\"Jerry Weintraub: Walk and Talk\\" (2 1/2 min), the producer takes us on a tour of the casino sets. Subtitles are available for the film in English, English SDH, French, Spanish.

B000VI70X6|5.0|When i attended the Shakira concert in Madison Square Garden just last year, i was left with this excitement and urge to have more.  The same could be said about this amazing live concert footage from none other then Shakira.  Shakira has this quality that no other globally known pop star possesses and to better understand who Shakira is, you might just have to experience Shakira at her finest, live in concert.  No other artist can own a stage without having to have high-cost productions and over-the-top dancing-coreography other then Shakira.  Shakira owns the stage by herself without having to rely on \\"distractions\\" to make up for the lack of artistry.  It's clear from the very begining (INTRO-ESTOY AQUI) that you are in for a true artistic treat.  The concert is absolutely a marvel to the ears.  In ESTOY AQUI, Shakira manages to cross-breed a beautiful mix of modern contemporary sounds with infused mystical sounding arabic instrumentation.  Another memorable moment in this concert was within the song \\"TE DEJO MADRID.\\"  The performance was oustanding and the visual excitement was Shakira herself on stage beautifully managing to posses this confidence and sensuality behind a backdrop of illuminating lights, bright piercing orange hues.  Older shakira classics where my favs including (ANTOLOGIA, DONDE ESTAN LOS LADRONES,ETC) How can I not mention the outstanding collaborations with Wyclef and Alejandro Sanz.  Hips don't lie was definately the crowd pleaser, both visually and for some musically, as it was just that year that Hips dont lie was in its Prime.  La Tortura was amazing as well.  Nothing wrong could be said about the performance all together.     Bonus Features: I think her previous DVD (LIVE & OFF THE RECORD) did capture a better feel for DIARY-ESQUE look behind Shakira's life, however this dvd did let us have a peek into Shakira's world, mainly with her overlooked and often, never-mentioned, Humanitarian work. It was interesting to know that Shakira had started her humanitarian effort ever since she was 18, way before her global popularity, and way before being a ARTIST-HUMANITARIAN, was the \\"IT/PUBLIC RELATIONS\\" thing to do in Hollywood.  The AROUND THE WORLD documentary was more like a DVD PROMO since it almost felt like they started the project and left it as is.  Around the world doesnt mean 3 countries, what about Europe? What about Latin America? It was nice but it was definately sad to know that it was only 5 minutes.    Overal: 5/5 Perfection.  If hot sexy singer and their dancers sliming around half naked on stage is your thing or if your more into hearing playback and fakeness, then this dvd is definately not for you! However, if you want to witness a true talent-singer-writer-PERFORMER who is deserving and growing globally in fame, this is the concert DVD you have been looking for.  Its no lie, her hips dont lie.  I dont lie, its a great DVD, must for any Shakira fan or anyone looking for a CHANGE.
B0009IW98O|5.0|A great album that I just never get tired of- I always wish it was just a little longer every time I get done listening to it. Every single track on this cd is done extremely well with the only \\"average\\" song being Jesse James. What makes this cd so great is that it is the only successful album ever put out that was made up of mostly cover songs performed by one artist...something few artists would ever have the guts to do. And the fact that the covers are done in a way that they aren't carbon copies of the original versions makes them even more enjoyable to listen to. I would recommend this cd (especially at this ridiculously cheap price) to anyone looking for a refreshingly unique and innovative listening experience.
0061547832|5.0|A another great book by THE DONALD.  I feel lucky to receive his advice and learn from his experiences that he shares in this book.

B000WCBMA8|5.0|If you haven't already bought The Hives new Black and White album then you are definitely depriving your hears, and should immediately add their album to your collection. The album is jam packed with songs that will have you up out of your seating dancing and singing along.    The thing that I love best about their new album is that they were not afraid to take chances and experimented with different sounds. The album is not what I expected and that's a good thing. The Hives are able to make the transition from strictly rock n' roll/punk songs to a more eclectic style. All the while staying true to their rock roots and keeping their distinct sound that distinguishing them from other musical artists.    There is definitely a strong blues and hip hop-esque influence on this album. I think most notably heard in the song Giddy up. For those of you who are not into the whole hip hop thing dont be scared away by my description. The Black and White album is definitely a rock n' roll album but influences by other genres of music can be heard. The Hives create their own, new, unique sound.   Hey Little World and You Dress Up For Armageddon has more of an old school punk sound to me, which I really like.  The album even includes a catchy anthem song- T.H.E.H.I.V.E.S.    Buy the new album. If you dont, you are definitely missing out and depriving yourself.

B000VNMMQG|5.0|AMAZING GRACE  is a beautifully mounted, well-scripted, powerful film that reminds us that there were heroes in the late 1700s who vehemently fought the fight for abolition of slavery. Benefiting from a tight intelligent script by Steven Knight and directed with great sensitivity and fluidity by Michael Apted, the film captures the flavor of the turn of the 18th century into 19th century in England when slavery was a commodity the wealthy could ill afford to lose, and how the courage and perseverance of William Wilberforce created probably one of the first human rights movements on record.<br /><br />William Wilberforce (Ioan Gruffudd) witnessed the horrors of transporting slaves from Africa to be sold around the world to wealthy plantation owners and to serve as cheap and disrespected servants to the British populace.  Encouraged by a previous slave dealer John Newton (Albert Finney) turned contrite priest, his friend Prime Minister William Pitt (Benedict Cumberbatch), and the informed woman of his life Barbara Spooner (Romola Garai), Wilberforce bonds with a band of abolitionists including Thomas Clarkson (Rufus Sewell) and Oloudaqh Equiano (Youssou N'Dour) and begins long years of battling for abolition in the Parliament where cads such as Lord Tarleton (Ciar&aacute;n Hinds) and the Duke of Clarence (Toby Jones) fight his every word.<br /><br />One of the hallmarks of this fine film is the dignity it sustains: in a film that could have easily focused on depictions of slave abuse to make its point, it instead elects to keep the focus on the heart of the struggle against the inhumanity by subtle yet powerful means.  The title of the film, of course, comes form the song the reformed John Newton wrote as he had a life altering experience to end his slave trading to fight for human rights.  It is a haunting reminder that is used throughout the film in the score by David Arnold.  The cast is uniformly excellent with not only first class performances by each of the leads, but also by superb cameos from such fine artists as Michael Gambon, Nicholas Farrell, Sylvestra Le Touzel, Jeremy Swift, and Stephen Campbell Moore.  The atmosphere of both elegance and poverty of London is captured in the cinematography by Remi Adefarasin. This is an epic film with a powerful message that deserves the attention of us all.  Highly recommended. Grady Harp, November 07cameos from such fine artists as Michael Gambon, Nicholas Farrell, Sylvestra Le Touzel, Jeremy Swift, and Stephen Campbell Moore.

B0001ARCFA|5.0|I have four pair of headphones costing between 20-50 dollars, including such brands as Sennheiser, Logitech, Sony, and Eton. They're all capable headphones but they're Closed-Back style, which, while keeping external sound out, is also harder on the ears and which, I've read, compromises sound. So for my ear safety and for a bigger sound, I opted for the AKG K24. Here's what I like: Good build quality, comfortable large ear gel ear cups, microjack fits in iPod without needing an adapter (true of all my other headphones). The sound is good, great even, but I wouldn't go so far to say they produce the \\"wow factor.\\" However, be aware of the fact that I don't pump up the volume very loud because I don't want to blast my eardrums. Are they worth the price? That's a subjective question. For many who want to spend less on an Open-Ear headphone without compromising sound, I think most will be happy with the 20-dollar Audio-Technica ATH-MZX Open-Ear headphones.

B0000DD7LC|5.0|First of all, this album contains \\"You Don't Know my Name\\", \\"If I was Your Woman\\", \\"Karma\\", and \\"If I Ain't Got You\\". I can't think of anything except Janet's 1993 album that has so many classic tracks one after the other. One of my favorites remains the album opener (I love how Alicia always has a quiet piano intro that breaks into a big song).<br /><br />However, moving past the obviously amazing singles, there is much here to drool over. 'Samsonite Man' in particular - there is something very unique about that track. When most people think of this CD, they almost always remember \\"If I was Your Woman\\" first, but I would say that I personally think of \\"Dragon Days\\" first - its a slow burner, but when it hooks you in, it really never lets go.<br /><br />Alicia Keys made a better album on \\"Unplugged\\" (she has never sounded better before or after that album), but as a studio album, this will always be my favorite Keys album. There is something special about it, you can just put it on ANY time of day, let it play and do its' thing, and it will never disappoint you. Her debut album is certainly not 'timeless', but this one definitely is.<br /><br />If you are at all into collecting classic R&B records, then this has to be in your collection already. If you're new to the scene, there are very few albums on Amazon with so much repeat value. Get this today!
B000002HAJ|3.0|I'm a diehard Cure fan.  However, to me this cd represents the beginning of the Cure's demise as a great band.

B000E41MS6|5.0|The first season of the new Doctor Who is everything a Doctor Who fan could ever hope for.  Never has a series so lived up to its potential as these new episodes have done.  Right from the get-go the producers and respective episode directors have gone for a newer, gleaming, edgier look--and yet the dialogue and some recurring villains from the doctor's past keep the series simultaneously grounded in that past Doctor Who most of us grew up with, especially those of who were us weaned on the Baker and Pertwee years.  Each episode builds on itself as well.  Although Russell Davies was the primary genius behind the resurrection of Who, a good portion of the credit must also go to the onscreen chemistry of Christopher Eccleston and Billie Piper.  Eccleston will grow on you so quickly that it will be all the more painful to see him depart by the end of the season.  The Rose character is a wonderful continuation from Ace, the last onscreen companion we saw (unless you are counting the TV movie that most people have pretty much disowned) the doctor with.  She is both tough and vulnerable, but on way many more levels.  These episodes are all beautifully written-watch for Rose's short speech in The End of the World episode right after the earth explodes.  The Unquiet Dead brings us a world weary Charles Dickens-our first glimpse of him just before he has to face another Christmas audience is a hoot.  The Dalek episode is stunning: there isn't much action, but the Moby Dick take on the Doctor and just about all the dialogue is positively electric, especially when the Dalek nonchalantly remarks how the Doctor would have made a good Dalek.  My personal favorite episodes are the two-part story arc of Empty Child and The Doctor Dances.  One reason is that we get introduced to Capt. Jack Harkness (supremely played by John Barryman), the most over the top and larger than life sidekick we'll probably ever get to see with the Doctor.  The other is the reason for the title of the second part--not going to tell!  When the Doctor does dance, it is perhaps the defining moment of the whole series for the whole of the 40+ years it has run.  Trust me, it's that perfect.  The Long Game is probably the creepiest episode in the series.  Those of you who saw the movie, Shaun of the Dead will see a familiar face in Simon Pegg.  Father's Day tweaks the familiar why-time-shouldn't-be-tampered-with-and-changed angle.  Boom Town has an interesting twist-the villain gets caught, but it is the Doctor who has to dispatch the justice.  Bad Wolf and Parting of the Ways bring the first season to a close by reintroducing an old enemy and a seemingly inescapable outcome.  Bad Wolf is a keen parody of the reality tv/survivor shows that have come to dominate the ratings.  Parting is almost mystical in its resolution.  Eccleston gets a nice sendoff.  The DVD extras almost defy description.  There are commentaries for all the episodes and interviews with all the major stars as well as featurettes on everything from special effects to location choices.  Truly the future has never looked so golden--and you will see when you crack open the second season!
B000RFPORM|5.0|One of the greatest movies in history. Funny, serious, cerebral, experimental, touching, hopeful, autobiographical . . . not list of words can really describe it. A director struggles to make the film that is in his imagination. Internal and external conflicts pull him from all directions. It is a movie about the movie you are watching (that will make sense after you see it.) Every scene is wonderful. Fellini's masterpiece.
B000H0MKGK|5.0|I loved it instantly, and it still keeps growing on me! I think the first single, Waiting On The World To Change, is the weakest song. But even so, I like it.

This is an album I can listen to all the way through, without even being tempted to skip any songs. Get it!

B000069KGM|5.0|ESSENTIAL ALBUM!!! This is one of the finest debuts in the annals of rock 'n' roll. It's on this record we hear the Chicago that the band could've & should've been; not the trite pop ballad singles band that they became. Yes, they sold a ton of records but the talent was misused. Chicago, in its original incarnation, was one of the most talented groups there ever were. Jimi Hendrix had commented that Terry Kath was the greatest lead guitarist he had ever heard; & with his accidental death Chicago lost its heart & soul. They had three lead vocalists, each distinctive, that could do every imaginable style between them. On this album the styles of music go through blues, hard rock, Latino rock, ballads, psychedelic & more. If Chicago had remained like this I would've bought every album they had released. When I first got this album on vinyl in '69 I was impressed by it; but now, 38 years later, it impresses me even more.    Chicago Transit Authority made it to #17 on the album charts, an impressive debut. The only single that was released originally to get any chart action was \\"Question 67 & 68\\" in 1969 (what were the first 66 questions?), it only got to #71. A year or so later when Chicago began to get a lot more exposure & press the original singles were re-released, this time with much more success. This time \\"Question 67 & 68\\" went to #24. \\"Does Anybody Really Know What Time It Is?\\" went to #5 on the Adult Contemporary chart in 1970, later, in 1971, it would go to #7 on the Pop Singles chart. \\"Beginnings\\" would go to #1 on the Adult Contemporary & #7 on the Pop Singles charts. Even \\"I'm a Man\\" made it to #49 on the Pop Singles chart in 1971.     The album opens with the Kath composition \\"Introduction\\", lyrically it introduces the group. It's a good rocking number that has a slower jazz section in the middle. \\"Does Anybody Really Know What Time It Is?\\" is composed by Lamm; in the early days of Chicago he was the main composer & vocalist. It's a pop song, though catchy, doesn't really go anywhere. Then comes Lamm's classic \\"Beginnings\\" that has a unique rhythm guitar. The final half of the song shows the band off in a jam mode that has the horns featured & then closes with a percussion section that has a Latino feel. \\"Question 67 & 68\\" is composed by Lamm & is the only song that features a complete lead vocal by Peter Cetera. It's pop & it also has a jazzy middle section. \\"Listen\\" is another Lamm composition that features a great bass riff by Cetera. Kath also gets to show how good of a lead solo he was capable of. \\"Poem 58\\", written by Lamm, allows the three piece of Kath (lead), Cetera (bass) & Seraphine (drums) to show what they could have done as a power trio. The long intro reminds of the 'controlled chaos' that Cream was known for. After about five minutes Chicago gets into another section that features the entire group. Then comes the Kath composition \\"Free Form Guitar\\", so many groups did this sort of thing in this era; the lead guitarist goes on for almost seven minutes by himself. Personally, I could've done without this. Then comes the excellent bluesy song by Lamm, \\"South California Purples\\". Kath once again does a lead solo that shows just how good he could be, even Lamm does some excellent keyboard riffing, one of Chicago's very best songs. Then comes \\"I'm a Man\\", written by Jimmy Miller & Steve Winwood & recorded originally by the Spencer Davis Group. Chicago makes this THEIR song vastly improving on the original. It's not often that I think that a cover version is better than the original but this is one of those times. Terry Kath once again shines on the leads. By this point you might understand why Jimi Hendrix gave such high praise of him. The lead vocals are shared by Kath, Lamm & Cetera, each taking a verse in turn. The rest of the album doesn't really do much for me. \\"Prologue, August 29, 1968\\", \\"Someday (August 29, 1968)\\" & \\"Liberation\\" are songs that I never listened to very often. The first is an exceptfrom the Chicago Democratic Convention. The second is a plain composition with lyrics that stem from that time. \\"Liberation\\" goes on forever but it's the best of the final three songs. Chicago borders on psychedelic with this composition.     When you analyze the group Chicago at this period you can't help but realize how talented they were. For those that are only familiar with the Chicago that put out syrupy sweet pop singles you are in for a major surprise but, honestly, if you like the pop single version of them, you won't like this version. But this album shows that Kath was an excellent guitarist, Cetera was an excellent bassist, Seraphine was an excellent drummer. Though I didn't mention the rest of them, I'm not slighting them. It's just that those three in particular never got to show what they could do once the group went into pop completely.    Quality of the disc is excellent & there are liner notes but not extensive. This is the remastered version by Rhino. For those that don't know, Rhino is probably the best at remastering old albums. Buy & ENJOY!!!

And what about that one scene when he performed that weird clown run down the hall?  It also felt a bit long.  Honestly there were too many painfully acted scenes, but I do give the screenwriter props for an interesting concept and I think the director's cut ending was bold and won another star from me.

B000VL9XE2|5.0|'Miss Machine' was, of course, a controversial release for DEP.  I'm in the apparent minority which considers 'Miss Machine' equal, if not superior, to 'Calculating Infinity'.  Personally, I like albums that actually have a mix of sophistication and a certain amount of accessibility, and 'Miss Machine' did this beautifully, even if it was at the cost of some of the sheer unrelenting madness of 'Calculating Infinity'. Overall, however, I think it balanced out, and I was prepared for further change with 'Ire Works', whatever it might be.<br /><br />Unsurprisingly, 'Ire Works' is an extension of the ideas found in 'Miss Machine', and it's sure to raise the ire(hahaha) of many a fan.  That said, some are severely overstating the change.  I've noticed that at least two people here have compared this to the change Metallica underwent by making the Black Album.  This is a comically ridiculous comparison, and I say that as someone who doesn't see that release as an abomination before God and Man.  First of all, roughly half of the material here would fit in on 'Calculating Infinity' nicely.  You sure as hell can't say that of the Black album and Metallica's 80's material.  Second, there are only two really overtly commercial tracks on here. ('Black Bubblegum' and 'Milk Lizard', of course.) 'Sick on Sunday', 'Dead As History' and 'Mouth of Ghosts' may not be old-school DEP, but they ain't gonna get much play on the radio either, and the idea that this album is, as a whole, particularly commerical is truly laughable.  I'll admit that I think they maybe went a little too far and I think this could definitely stand to have maybe one more pure tech-metalcore track.  Still, the fact of the matter is that all the material here is first-rate, so I can't complain too much.  Anwyway, with an album this dense, I'm not prepared to say whether or not it's superior or inferior to their earlier releases, but I can say that it's worthy of being mentioned alongside them, creating a three-release sequence that few bands can match.<br /><br />Again, 'Ire Works' is an extension of 'Miss Machine', continuing to mix DEPs signature frenetic, flailing technical metalcore with electronic elements and some singing/melody.  We've got a few changes, with Gil Sharone taking over on drums, Ben Weinman now the sole guitarist and a sharper, much more expensive production, particularly when compared to the rougher than expected 'Miss Machine'.  None of these changes hurt the band, in my estimation.  Weinman is more than sufficient to cover the guitars in the studio, Sharone is, if anything, more manic than his predecessor, and the production is crystal-clear without sacrificing any intensity.<br /><br />The openers, 'Fix Your Face' and 'Lurch' ought to satisfy old-time DEP junkies, though no doubt some will naysay them anyway.  The guitars are pure metallic shards twisted through lightning fast, shifting time signatures, the drums a mad, jazz-metal cacophony and Puciato's vocals primarily either a feral shriek or roar.  This is vintage DEP, and few people can do it like them.  On the downside, they can't quite match the extravagant brilliance of these tracks with any of the later tech tracks, but they're all very good.<br /><br />Then the album takes a weird turn. 'Black Bubblegum' is the most controversial track, and while I can respect why some people hate it, I don't.  Fact is, I like it a lot.  No, it's not particularly sophisticated, certainly not sophisticated at all by DEP standards, but it's a fun, catchy track.  I wouldn't want 'em to make an album exclusively like this, but in the whole context I think it works well.  The pacing also gets a bit off at this point, with two neat interludes followed by a very short tech track followed by another short, 'Calculating Infinity'+ more electronics style instrumental.  I've nothing against having what is almost an intermission in the album, but it comes too early.<br /><br />Anyway, after this sort of interlude we get to '82588' and 'Party Smasher', two more caustic, tech-metal barrages, which are sandwiched around another  controversial track, 'Milk Lizard'.  '82588' and 'Party Smasher' aren't as good as the two openers, but they're still remarkably solid, and I'm, again, fond of the controversial song. 'Milk Lizard'is a bit more out there than 'Black Bubblegum', but you can still see it being played on the radio.  Nevertheless, I think it works as such, with a varied, powerful performance from Puciato and a nice epic ending.<br /><br />The album closes with three more unusual tracks.  'Dead as History' reminds somewhat of 'Phone Home', as it's another relatively slow-burning, electronically tinged track, albeit with more melody this time around.  Again, I wouldn't want them to make an entire album of this material, but it works as a one-off on a particular album.  'Horse Hunter' opens up as another techy number, but it gets a bit more conventional as it moves on, changing into straight up pounding metallic punk mixed with some ghostly, falsetto melody.  Not the best track here, but it definitely works.  Finally we get to the unusual closer, 'Mouth of Ghosts'.  This is a moody, low-key number with smooth, flowing bass, jazzy piano, ethereal, reverberating guitars all before the expansive, epic close.  Initially I didn't think this one totally worked, but after a few listens I think it's a great and unexpected closer.  The last minute and a half is just fantastic, with perhaps Puciato's most emotional, affecting vox ever.  It's an effective culmination of the album.<br /><br />Anyway, there's not much else to say.  This is just a remarkably sophisticated, intense album, and DEP are perhaps the best band on the planet.

B000Y7U98C|5.0|I saw this movie in the movie theatre and some knucklehead in front of me complained all the way through because the characters made stupid decisions leading up to disaster and that the movie was not realistic. THAT'S THE POINT!!! There would be no movie if people didn't screw up and disaster was not in the horizon. That being said... this movie is worth the price of admission simply for how beautiful it looked. It was like watching sci-fi art. If you like the tense heart pounding moments of 28 days later in a beautiful landscape... this movie is for you. I can only imagine how awesome this movie would look in HD. If you like sci fi... get this movie!!!! If you like art.. get this movie! And cillian murphy who is british has the potential of becoming the Johnny Depp of England. I really like him as an actor and the rest of the cast was a good mix of mainly unknowns. Get this movie!

0784011680|5.0|`Chaplin' has a lot going for it.  It's a biopic and that always rests well with me.  The subject of that said biopic is a man who was famous for his ability to entertain.  The star cast in that important role of lead delivers a performance so electrifying there's no wonder why he received the Oscar nomination.  The rest of the cast is so star studded you're drawn to the prospect of what you'll see, even if every apart from the star is limited in their screen time.  It's faithfully directed by a man who adored and respected his subject.  But, without a script, without a story none of this really matters.  So, what makes `Chaplin' a film worth every second is the fact that it tells quite a story.<br /><br />The life of Charlie Chaplin was one filled with rises and falls.  He started off struggling but then rose almost immediately before falling back down only to be lifted up once again.  It's a rollercoaster of a way to live, but it makes for one interesting journey for the audience.  Charlie Chaplin started his life dirt poor.  What made things worse was the fact that his mother, for her own good, was admitted to an asylum while Charlie was still quite young.  His mothers theatrical aspirations did have an impact on Charlie though, a good one, for he soon made a name for himself as a comedian of the stage.  It wasn't until he moved to the states to pursue film roles though that he became the face behind silent film.<br /><br />`Chaplin' would be little more than a good story without the brilliant performance given by Robert Downey Jr., a performance that captures the essence that was Charlie Chaplin and exposes this man to the full.  Downey Jr. understands Chaplin and brings so much light and charisma to this role, a role that defined him as a star and not just a Hollywood bad-boy.  I only wish that Robert Downey Jr. could receive more roles of this nature for he really sinks his teeth into this performance and drags out something everyone can admire and respect.  He captured the emotional depth of this man while embellishing the signature charm and comedic grace of the legend himself.  A far cry from a mere mimic, Downey Jr. slipped away inside this man and recreated him from the ground up.<br /><br />Sadly, this was released the same year as `Malcolm X' so I can't truthfully say that Robert Downey Jr. was robbed of the Oscar.  In fact Denzel Washington was robbed of the Oscar, but that's for another review.<br /><br />The film exposes the good as well as the bad times in this mans life, from his womanizing days, his many marriages and his confrontations with J. Edgar Hoover, a volatile relationship that caused much heartache in Chaplin's life.  It never rushes things but takes it time to flesh out this man and create a feeling of truly knowing him inside and out.  Apparently the original cut of the film was nearly four hours long, and while that seems like a long time I'd be interested in seeing the film in its entirety for I'm sure there is so much more of this mans life that would be intriguing to discover.  Still, with all the cuts made to the film it never appears condensed or lacking.<br /><br />The film sports a slew of supporting performances, all of which are brilliantly crafted by the cast.  Geraldine Chaplin plays her own grandmother Hannah effortlessly with such commanding presence and Paul Rhys is able to play second fiddle to the star without giving up is star power entirely.  The beautiful actresses who played the women in Charlie's life all do splendid jobs, Diane Lane in particular is stunning and makes the most lasting impression.  Moira Kelly is wonderful as Chaplin's loving wife Oona, but she lacks the screen presence that Lane brings to her performance.  Milla Jovovich is stunning as Charlie's first wife Mildred and Dan Aykroyd is in top form as Mack Sennett and delivers an exciting and well rounded comedic performance.  The cast is so extensive it's really hard to single out everyone, but one performer that needs to be mentioned is Kevin Kline who just delivers effortlessly as Charlie's good friend Douglas Fairbanks.  He's charming and graceful and so in tune with her character it's an utter joy to watch.<br /><br />`Chaplin' delivers everything you could ask for in a biopic.  It's interesting, informative, entertaining and commanding, giving us reasons to laud, admire and sympathize with a man who brought so much joy to so many people.Kline who just delivers effortlessly as Charlie's good friend Douglas Fairbanks.

B000VNMMQG|3.0|Amazing Grace is a silly title for this film, designed, I assume to capture a conservative, Christian audience. Why? Because the song refers to God's grace, poured out on the undeserving. Wilberforce's faith was not a component of his life; it was what drove his every action. But this movie was clearly made by people who see religious belief as a quaint custom from the past. It exemplifies a very modern sensibility: Christianity, if it must exist at all, should be a social club dedicated to doing good works. \\"Oh how nice it was when those nice religious folks did such nice things,\\" say, I suppose, the Hollywood folk who created this pap. But the lyrics to Amazing Grace are not about doing good things. Even worthy good things. They show how God rescues us from sin and despair and gives us new life. \\"I was blind, but now I see.\\" Despite the droning bagpipes and funereal pace that conclude the film, it is a happy song. We have received a priceless gift. Wilberforce is never shown as either blind or seeing. And his faith is a jolly willingness to enjoy nature, but little more.<br /><br />So, the drive that came from unshakable faith is missing. We see a driven man, but driven because he's a softy, not because he loves God. And how did a whole culture change its mind in just a few years? Slavery had been the way of the world since the beginning of time (and still is in many places.) The English, the owner of the seas, making a good living transporting this human cargo, stopped. And gave up an immensely profitable practice. That is an astounding, nearly unparalleled, accomplishment. How did this happen? One man? No, there was much more going on during this time, and we witness precious little of that. It's as if Wilberforce was working in a vacuum (sure we see the petitions, though why a body generally elected by a very tiny percentage of the populace would care about them I cannot say.)<br /><br />And, I suppose, as a sop to feminists, his wife is portrayed as a fiery believer, capable of an all-night discussion (which would never have happened between two unmarried people such as these) not the happy stay-at-home mom she apparently was.<br /><br />Not a bad film, with superlative performances all around, but one that downplays what was important to its protagonists and focuses on what is important to a contemporary audience.of an all-night discussion (which would never have happened between two unmarried people such as these) not the happy stay-at-home mom she apparently was.

B000TLYERA|5.0|Coming after a brilliant debut which proved to be their best ever album, it was always going to be tough top but this, their second album, came pretty darn close.  Some of their most popular tracks are on this album: \\"Sweet Home Alabama\\", \\"Don't Ask Me No Questions\\", \\"Workin' For MCA\\" and \\"Call Me The Breeze\\" but just like in their debut album, there are no fillers on this baby.<br /><br />This version comes in a mini-lp replica sleeve (mlps) design which is very well put together with good quality, thick cardboard that very faithfully resembles the original vinyl sleeve.  The sound quality is also pretty good indicating a successful attempt at remastering and hence a cleaner, less muddy sound.  Overall though, I still think \\"Pronounced Leh-Nerd Skin-Nerd\\" is the better album but only just.  There is also an insert with all the lyrics in both English and Japanese.  The bonus tracks are:<br /><br />9. Don't Ask Me No Questions (Single Version)<br />10.Was I Right Or Wrong? (Demo Version)<br />11.Take Your Time<br /><br />Before the tragic plane crash which decimated the band, Lynyrd Skynyrd was in the zone churning out great classic southern rock album after album.  Their first two albums are essential listening material for all classic rock fans and should be in every music fan's cd library.<br /><br />Highly recommended.

B00005JPS9|4.0|Good stories can't die off. They live on by being retold again for every new generation. My condolences to the purists: this telling speaks to today's generation.<br /><br />What's of this generation is great. Star power includes Anthony Hopkins, Angelina Jolie, John Malkovich, and scripting by Neil Gaiman. The animation (yes, it's animation) represents the very best of this generation too. Jolie has voice credits, but she clearly gave a lot more than her voice to the animators. Ditto Hopkins, who transformed expertly into Hrothgar - computerized alchemy explored the ridiculous idea that Hopkins could ever be dumpy, but did so convicingly. Fussy bits, hair and beard among them, set this animation ahead of others, but so do the other aspects of cinema and artistry. Today's best animation comes up short of reality, but this comes right up to the best of today's animation.<br /><br />The story itself survived largely intact. Specialists (I can name one) will be disappointed - but they always are. The graphic novel might be the literary form of the emerging generation, and this speaks directly in that idiom as only computer animation can. Even with that, real tensions with real ambiguities come through. The odd logic of senior wife protecting junior doxy and vice versa gives a little to think about, even if only a little.<br /><br />If you want the grandest of comic books, you came to the right place. After a thousand years of telling, maybe more, this story still fits well between the covers of today's comics. Then, once comic-fied, it becomes the grandest of comic-book movies. Whoever did \\"300\\" did well, but was just practicing. \\"Beowulf\\" is what they practiced for.<br /><br />-- wiredweird
0440238609|5.0|My three girls and I all love to read, I mean LOVE it!  We also like to discuss books we read together.  As such, it is always a joy to come across a book or series that engages all of us and ends with long conversations we all learn from.  While I do not feel these books are age appropriate for my 8 year old, even with an advanced reading level, it IS for my 13 and 17 year olds.  After The Golden Compass, they both fought over who would get to read The Subtle Knife first.<br /><br />Based on some of the reviews here, much of this series seems to personally offend anyone that is christian.  It seems like anything that is threatening to their beliefs is deemed dangerous and negative.  However, I think it is a good thing to have your beliefs challenged; it makes you use your mind, question things, and creates thought!<br /><br />I would much rather have my girls read something they didn't agree with and found distasteful than have their right to read what they want denied.  I am grateful for the freedom they experience in our country and the opportunities they are afforded because of it--opportunities to read something like these books that will make them use their minds, for example!<br /><br />It comes down to this:  If you are someone who likes to read, likes to be entertained, likes to use your imagination, and likes to think for yourself rather than allowing someone else to think for you, you will find value in this series!
B00009MGGI|4.0|My wife and I watched all three in this series, and were horrified at the snobbishness and outright hatred the screenwriter has for Margaret Thatcher. Absolutely no reason for this silliness to be in \\"The Final Cut\\" except for the screenwriter to show the world how much of a left wing nut he is. The first two, \\"house of Cards\\" and \\"to play the king\\" were good, altho the second one with Michael Kitchen should have foretold the left wing bias coming in the third. The ending of \\"The Final Cut\\" was rather disappointing and seemed as if they just couldn't think of any way to end the thing and took the easy---and laughable---way out. A majour disappointment to say the least and not at all believable.<br />If you get the chance, at least watch the first one, \\"house of cards\\" and perhaps the second \\"to play the king\\"(only for the great michael kitchen) and leave it at that.
B000MV8ABS|5.0|Without a doubt,the very best Horror/Science Fiction hybrid ever made & one of the very best Horror movies ever made. This classic movie will surely touch a nerve & still scare mostly anybody that watches it. In the same class as Kubrick & Friedkin.....genious. It goes without saying that this falls into the category of must owns.    Its so great that Anchor Bay recently re-issued Phantasm on dvd because even as little as a few months ago people were paying 20.00+ on the secondary market any time the 1999 issue surfaced. Just be aware that this is a very special movie & in my opinion nothing even comes close. You must be a fan of 1970's style horror that can at times be a little slow paced, but makes up for it with very unique content. I am extremely critical on horror movies as they are my favorite to films watch & Phantasm in my mind was perfect in every way. Its a true shame that there will never be another Phantasm & while part 2, 3, & 4 are very good, they can't compare to the original as it has a totally diferent feel & atmosphere. If you're a newer horror fan & are unfamiliar with this iconic film, just buy it without thinking twice.

As someone not familar with most of their material, I saw the band give a furious performance of \\"The Pretender\\" on SNL last month, a charging rock tune that reminds me of Metallica. The Foo Fighters seem influenced by the best players in rock music both near and far as you listen to the rest of this album, and in an era sometimes drowning in Hip Hop and American Idol, it's a blessing to find an album you can still bring home and simply enjoy as it keeps the sound of Rock'N'Roll fresh and alive.

Enough of that, now to the review...\\"Die Hard\\" was a great film...it had great dialogue, great acting, and scraps of 'violent interaction' every now and then...    \\"Die Hard 2:Die Harder\\" was a really solid entry, with really good dialogue, good acting, and scraps of 'violent interaction' thrown in for good measure...    \\"Die Hard With A Vengence\\", the third 'Die Hard' entry, rounded out the trilogy perfectly, with excellent acting, an excellent storyline, excellent dialogue, and a smattering of 'violent interaction' thrown in as an afterthought...    now comes \\"Live Free Or Die Hard\\", the fourth installment, made over a decade later and for a generation that isn't really used to hearing great dialogue or seeing great acting...they just want action...and while Bruce gives it his best when allowed to, this flick envelopes itself into a 'roadrunner' cartoon, with the bad guys ending up looking like Wile E. Coyote...    Not to say that that's such a bad thing, but...    with the other entries being so thought-filled, it's a shame to see this one 'lower it's standards' for today's generation...    still...a bad day of 'mcclane' is still better than anything else out there right now...
B000Q6GX5Y|4.0|The picture quality of the movie itself is amazing.  There is a very perceivable difference between the SD special features and the HD movie.  People say the picture is grainy, but it's because the enviroment calls for dust or ash or embers.  If there's one complaint, it is that the contrast seems a little harsher than the DVD which I also have.  There are much darker shadows covering more of people's faces, and there are scenes in the sun where the color looks a bit off (compared to the soft yellow-ish hue from the DVD).  I love the movie, and overall, I'm happy with my purchase.
0446577391|4.0|If you liked either The Camel Club or The Collectors, don't miss this book!<br /><br />If you haven't read The Camel Club or The Collectors, read those books before this one.<br /><br />Stone Cold is an exciting and major step forward in the plot development of the Camel Club series as Oliver Stone and Annabelle Conroy deal with deadly challenges and old demons.  In Stone Cold, the Camel Club moves from focusing on quirky to being operationally driven by the tools and tradecraft of assassins.  The title appears to be an attempt to capture the psychology of the professional assassin, someone who is effective because he brings no emotion to terminating life.  In keeping with Mr. Baldacci's ability to define and beautifully develop new characters, you'll be fascinated by the new character, Harry Finn, who tests for terrorist vulnerabilities as a profession, is a loving husband and father, and moonlights in assassinating assassins to settle an old score.<br /><br />The novel has three main story lines:  Finn's quest to eliminate old enemies, Annabelle Conroy's efforts to avoid being crushed by Jerry Bagger (the man she conned out of forty million dollars in The Collectors), and Oliver Stone's attempt to stay out of the public eye as someone chooses to expose his old connections to the CIA.  I found this worked well for making the story fast-paced and continually surprising because the stories interweave.<br /><br />But ultimately the appeal of this book is that it brings a lot of resolution to past and current conflicts in the series.<br /><br />The only thing I didn't like about the book was that it lacked most of the usual quirkiness of the characters and past plots.  Instead, this book is more of a standard spy versus spy, crook versus crook, and government against the bad guys type of story.  But it's quite good for what it is.  I hope the quirkiness doesn't disappear after this story.<br /><br />After you read this story, think about where you have followed orders . . . orders that you should have questioned.  What orders should you be questioning now?d.  What orders should you be questioning now?
0765357151|3.0|I guess I really don't like Vampire stories, if this tautly written classic filled with rich description, and keen insights into the human condition, can't hold my interest, then there's no hope for me. Even though I didn't enjoy the book as much as others have, I can certainly understand why it has achieved legendary status among fans of the genre. Unlike a lot of post-apocalyptic tales from this era, it has held up surprisingly well despite the 50+ years since it's first publication. Matheson's writing is on par with Heinlein, Dick, and the other masters of science fiction. Give this story a chance, I hope you like it more than I did.
B0000ADY9I|5.0|Of all of the live Allman sets  you MUST own this one!The original lineup and a legendary recording!
B000VLE3IS|5.0|I'm pleased by the sound on these cd's. I haven't bought any of the other compilations, so I can't compare. A few people have complained about the cheap cardboard packaging being tight on the cd's and scratching them. Others have commented that there isn't anything on the bonus DVD that isn't on the \\"Led Zeppelin\\" DVD set. So I bought the 2 CD set without the bonus DVD, it comes in a high quality plastic case. Since I have the DVD set, there was no point in spending the extra for the \\"bonus\\" version.
B000VSBX34|5.0|This clearly is not the best Beatles movie out there, but the outstanding restoration of the sound and picture is really well worth the price of the DVD. The picture is so sharp and clear that this is what the standard for all restorations should be. You can see that they devoted a lot of time in restoring HELP!. The extra's are a little weak and would have loved to have see some outtakes (if they exist)and perhaps interviews with George Martin or Paul McCartney on some of the stories behind the songs in the movie, but nevertheless I recommend you buy this because of the superior picture. The only disappointment is how come they didn't release this in Blu-Ray or HDDVD?
0061544493|5.0|Victoria Adams is a super-model woman of our times, with a fabulously famous and wealthy husband and three adorable sons. She became famous as a Spice Girl, but came from beginnings that were of modest means.  This is why I think the average woman can relate to her words of fashion inspiration.<br />  Victoria has a wonderful knack of expressing herself; one can imagine her pretty British accent as we read her prose in the book. She goes on quite a bit raving about the expensive stores in London and then other stores that only stock small to smallest sizes. Now, now now! How am I supposed to use that type of advice if I represent the average dress size in America? Size 10's are invited to read this book too, aren't we?<br />  Anyhow - - - too much emphasis was placed in these foreign stores, (I went to London and never did see them!) but I think that the main thrust of her book was to get us women to reevaluate our daily look and to perhaps, inject a bit of mischeif and fun back into our everyday wardrobes. Victoria goes on to discuss the practicality of picking out what we will wear the night before, so that there is time to browse in the drawers and closets of our shopping choices. She insists that adding a bit more effort in choosing our palate of clothing, we will emerge from our homes looking more pulled - together, more mature and if we look good, that directly impacts how we must feel on the inside.<br />  I enjoyed this book immensely; Mrs. Beckham helps to encourage us all to look terrific and enjoy our lives.  My favorite dress of Victoria's in on page 175. Go take a gander at this beautiful designer frock, in colors of pure white and majestic royal blue.  It's just a magnificent thing for her to place on her thin body. How nice it must be to have such a wardrobe as Victoria's!  I get inspired that I can do wonderful things to improve my looks too.<br />  Get this book and savor all the handy pointers given generously from Mrs. Beckham, from her grandiose closet in Beverly Hills to yours.<br />I think you will feel the joy she lives every day, and how wonderful her life is. She isn't much different than you or I; she values her modesty and I like how she is too modest to show her \\"knickers\\" in public, unlike other starletts of our times. Victoria is where she is today largely due to her as an individual possessing style and grace.  I liked the book so much, I bought one for a friend recovering from surgery. HEY - if all one can do is sit around all day, healing from surgery, one may as well enjoy a healthy laugh, chuckle and giggle or two. You'll get plenty of that from this charming little book!Beverly Hills to yours.  I think you will feel the joy she lives every day, and how wonderful her life is.

B0007SMD3W|4.0|Okay...this is the TRUE first Genesis album , before \\"Trespass\\". A lot of people dismiss it because it doesn't \\"sound\\" like what Genesis was soon to become. Much shorter songs , with a \\"pop\\" feel. But , still Gabriel's talents shine through.....there have been many versions of this available; this is the one to get..Superior sound , full lyrics , bonus tracks. Listen to it for what it is , not for what they were yet to become.
0618680004|3.0|This book is definitely worth reading, and by far the best of the current crop of anti-God books. The scientific parts, on evolution, are fascinating.  Most of the rest is simply silly.     To do him justice, he does not actually warm up the old chestnut that the Church persecuted Galileo for denying that the earth is flat (to which the answer can be found in one word: \\"Ptolemy\\"); but a great deal of the book is on that level. The problem isn't just that he knows no theology and not much philosophy, or even that he knows no history: it's that he doesn't know that he doesn't know, and doesn't know that it could be relevant. It's not a question of \\"respect\\", as in \\"you mustn't criticise religion, because that might hurt their poor little feelings\\", but of honesty in debate. No one expects Dawkins to become a profound theologian as a condition of disbelieving in religion, but if he actually writes a book about it he needs to do his homework; just as no one forces me to criticise \\"The God Delusion\\", but if I decide to do so I must first read it. On any other topic, Dawkins would find this instantly obvious: the fact that he doesn't when it comes to religion shows that we are in the presence, not of a rational argument, but of something like a phobia.     He takes it for granted that something like today's fundamentalism is the core form of religion, and that it prevailed universally until modern science and scholarship forced theologians to invent a liberal compromise in a last-ditch effort to save their skins. But he presents no evidence for this: he just knows it because it MUST be so. After all, the fundamentalists say so; and they have Bible quotes to back them up. (Naturally: a fundamentalist is, by definition, someone who takes the Bible literally. This is merely circular.) As Karen Armstrong argues, fundamentalism is itself the product of the modern literal, scientific understanding, and that may be why it is the only sort of religion that Dawkins can understand.Similarly, he takes it for granted that the foundation of all religion must be a scientific (though false) theory of cosmology, and that everything else is secondary. (Religions often _contain_ such a theory, but that is another question.) Again there is no evidence for this: the only reason is that that is the only presentation of religion that he can understand. The target is re-arranged to suit his convenience in hitting it.     Finding any connection between the scientist's awe at the workings of nature and the God of any religion is \\"intellectual high treason\\". Again, this has nothing to do with the evidence; any dispassionate reading would show that the God of Philo, Plotinus, Avicenna, Maimonides or Aquinas is far nearer to the God of Aristotle, and thus, in Dawkins' terms, Einsteinian religion, than to the God of the fundamentalists; so I suppose the philosophers too are guilty of intellectual high treason.  (And as a matter of fact, the quasi-physical God Dawkins has to posit to make the hypothesis testable would be unrecognisable to fundamentalists too.) No, it is all a priori prejudice. It is clearly not enough for him to argue that religion is irrational: that would leave it open for an opponent to argue that religion is rational, and that would never do. To make any concession to popular religion is to betray reason itself, because reason has already been defined as excluding religion. But if reason (by which he means the scientific method) is, for purely methodological reasons, excluded from supporting religion, it is equally excluded from refuting it, and we are back to the non-overlapping magisteria Dawkins so despises. He can't have it both ways.     His masterpiece is where he shows that atheism cannot cause atrocities because no one can go to war for the absence of a belief.  This piece of semantics is supposed to show that, in physical reality, religion is on balance a force for evil.  The empirical approach would be to contrast crimes committed by religious people which they would not have committed if they had been atheists with crimes committed by atheists which they would not have committed if they had been religious.  (And then repeat for good actions.) But no, the rules must be set so as to disqualify one side before the race begins.    A story of the Mullah Nasruddin shows him looking for his key in the garden. No, he didn't lose his key in the garden, but in the house. So why is he looking in the garden? \\"Because there is more light in the garden\\". That is the Dawkins method all over.     If you want a reasoned case, from someone who actually knows what he is attacking, read Bertrand Russell. If you are after entertainment, read Dawkins, to have your prejudices confirmed, or to be pleasantly irritated and titillated, as the case may be. The prose bounces along with a cheerful schoolboyish cocksureness, far preferable to the hysteria of Harris or the nastiness of Hitchens; and I am so pleased to read that the Bible is chiefly important as a literary prolegomenon to P. G. Wodehouse!
B000RL0WM8|3.0|\\"Acoustic Soul\\" is a classic album by India.Arie but this \\"Special Edition\\" is a complete waste of money if you have the original. The extra disc just has bonus remixes from the Singles off the album and these remixes are usually found on the CD Maxi and Vinyl singles. The same thing was done with Warren G.'s [[ASIN:B000ROAKSG Regulate...G Funk Era]]. And while the remixes aren't bad, they are not worth the re-purchase.
B00005JPKE|1.0|I tried to watch the film but I quit after the first few minutes.  The problem was that the second line of the captions were not displayed, making it impossible to understand what was going on.  I tried it on another TV-DVD player but it still did not work.  Strangely, it worked for the second disk, the one with the specials, but not the disks with the movie on it.   I wrote Amazon and they responded that it was too late to return it but not whether this was something wrong with my disk or with all of them. I would like to have the movie and would be willing to pay the few bucks to buy another disk but not until I know something about this problem.      Counting The War by Ken Burns as five movies, I bought 18 movies from Amazon about the same time.  I have watched almost all of them but I broke the cellophane on Letters from Iwo Jima just yesterday, found the problem, wrote Amzaon and got the form letter email from Amazon today.  First time I ever found Amazon unhelpful. Maybe they are too big.
B000T7FO6E|4.0|A fun CD for sure! 8 of the 14 tracks were originally recorded by The Beatles, and the others are gems from Ringo's solo career, including the tribute \\"Never Without You\\" written for George Harrison. Ringo's band sounds great. Granted it is not the full show that was recorded for PBS, and that is somewhat disappointing, which is why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5. But the recording is well mixed and clean, and Ringo plays many of his best songs.
B00003CXAW|5.0|I just saw this again on TCM, and the surprising thing about this film is that despite the fact that it's over 70 years old, its power hasn't diminished at all.  Despite 2 remakes and countless parodies (The Simpson is especially fond of parodying this film), it is still a great motion picture.  It is very intense and surprisingly terrifying, especially in the uncut version.  Despite the \\"advances\\" in SFX today, these effects don't feel dated, because you're so drawn into the story, and you really care about the characters.  Fay Wray and Carl Denham are real people, not just stock characters reading movie lines (ironically, Denham is a film producer here).  The scenes where Kong battles prehistoric creatures are unnerving and still unsettling even today (in some reissues, these scenes were cut, but have been restored for all subsequent DVD editions).<br /><br />As much as I admire Peter Jackson, I cannot understand why he would want to remake/\\"reimagine\\" this film, as it is his favorite film.  He is an excellent filmmaker (the scope of the Lord of the Rings films is amazing, and he should commended for that), but how can you remake something you love?  I don't understand it at all, and especially when the original film has so much force, power, and depth to it.  It's like remaking The Wizard of Oz or Gone with the Wind.<br /><br />Regardless, the original King Kong is magnificent, one of those movie classics that more than lives up to its reputation.
B000AXSN5G|4.0|The breezy, mellow feel to the opening song on this CD, \\"The Painter,\\" perfectly sets the pace and tone of \\"Prairie Wind.\\" \\"The Painter\\" quietly offers up laid-back but nostalgic lyrics sung in a wary, classic Neil Young voice; a beautiful slide guitar intersperses the gentle guitar plucking; light drums and a dependable bass lend weight to the composition. Undoubtedly, \\"Prairie Wind\\" was an ideal title for this album. The following tune, \\"No Wonder,\\" contains a darker sound, but the song's lyrics uphold the naturistic feel of the CD, and convey a sense of one's own mortality.<br /><br />The down-home instrumentation and vocals make it seem as if these tunes could be played on the rustic porch of a windswept prairie in the middle of nowhere. \\"Falling Off the Face of the Earth\\" is an example of Young's amazing ability to mesmerize simplistically, without bells and whistles. Whether he's rocking out electrically with his Crazy Horse band or playing lighter fare, as on \\"Falling,\\" many of Young's songs have a way of sneakily sucking you in in a catchy, repetitive manner that's lulling, both vocally and musically. On some of Young's tunes, seven minutes have passed by before you realize it; but somehow, the composition doesn't drag.<br /><br />Not all of \\"Prairie Wind\\" is soothing Western ballads played on the Badlands. \\"Far From Home\\" has a good-time, old-fashioned vibe that's endearing like an enjoyable family reunion; the title track dares to flex its acoustic muscle with hardened but longing lyrics and great backing vocals by a slew of talented female musicians; \\"He Was the King,\\" a tune about Elvis in all his incarnations, is pure rock and roll fun, while \\"When God Made Me\\" is a piano-soaked gospel relic that questions just as much as it faithfully believes.<br /><br />As poignant as all these songs are, perhaps none are more so than the sublime \\"This Old Guitar,\\" sung and played plaintively by Young, but somehow stirring up emotion by the truckload. The song is indicative of this entire heartwarming album, which thrives on simplicity, feeling and easy hooks.entire heartwarming album, which thrives on simplicity, feeling and easy hooks.
B000002NIW|1.0|The Deftones are not a talented band. Their lyrics are not deep, thought provoking, or poetic. The songwriting lacks depth. Their music gets old after the first listen. Most of the songs sound the same. There is no repeat value whatsoever. The singer acts like he has something important to say, which he doesnt have the savvy to express (he sounds like a girl). The guitarist tries way to hard to write a catchy riff, at which he fails miserably. Brian Welch could write a better riff if he was dead. The singer's voice is very annoying with that whiny tone that is stereotypical to numetal. I am shocked that this album recieved so many good reviews. I wonder if it was all the same person. True fans of music will realize that this album is drivel. The Deftones redeemed themselves later on with much better albums. The song, \\"Minerva\\", is a fantastic piece of songwriting. But this album sucks. Sorry, fanboys, but you should have picked up a Nine Inch Nails album instead, or a Depeche Mode album, U2 album, or hell, even a Linkin Park album (they suck) instead
B00005JPLW|5.0|It's hard to describe why this film is so visually compelling...just something you have to experience I think.  But combine that with the intriguing story and terrific performances...and you've got two thumbs up.<br /><br />Better than Troy, and as good as Gladiator.  I wonder how much more press 300 would have gotten if it would have had a Hollywood A-list cast.  ...although it probably wouldn't have been as good.
B000N4SHOE|5.0|Charming and beautifully crafted period piece based (somewhat loosely) on the life of Beatrix Potter (e.g. it portrays her relationship with her parents as warmer than it was).  However, what struck me, after some reflection, is that it is an amazingly powerful and gentle study of  complicated grief. Beatrix's disbelief and anguish over the sudden death of her fiance and publisher, Mr. Warner, is all the more agonizing as she had been forced to keep the engagement a secret, depriving her of social acknowledgement and support for her grief. Her overwhelming and disorienting grief is expressed poignantly in the change in her relationship with her heretofor reliable animal characters.  I found the pictures (Beatrix, brilliantly played by Rene Z., with her animal character drawings augmented with limited animation) to be worth 1000 words.  .....and it has a happy ending, both in the movie and real life!

B000P2A256|5.0|Everybody must know that Maroon 5 isn't a rock band. And as a Pop Band, mixing great production with smart samplers and dancing grooves, they are the best today. This CD is a prove that a record can talk about one single subject without being boring. Adam also can give Maroon 5 an unique style with his voice that is very hard to find or imitate. A great CD from a great band.

When the director tried to shorten Gary Cooper's court monologue she threatened to walk off the production and remove her name from the credits.   One of the studio owners had to call the director to get him to give in.    Enjoyed the film too...
1401300529|5.0|My father spent 13 months in Korea from 52-53 and after reading several of Halberstam's books, including the Best and the Brightest, I purchased this book for my father who served in a combat front line capacity with the U.S. Marines. He was particularly impressed with the interesting detail that Halberstam captures, which is what Halberstam has been known for along with his ability to tell the story in a most coherent fashion. My father's particular interest was how Halberstam documents vividly the lack of U.S.'s preparedness militarily for war at the time of Korea and the faulty intelligence that totally underestimated the tenacity of the North Koreans, the potential of the Chinese to enter the conflict, underestimating the effectiveness of the Chinese and their massive movements across the Yalu. Although well aware of the failures of Major General Almond, Mac Arthur's prot&eacute;g&eacute;e, my father still found it a fascinating to read about Almond's constant conflicts with the more experienced Major General O. P. Smith of the First Marine Division, contributing to decisions that over extended the U.S. forces approaching the Yalu River and the gaps between them that the Chinese expertly exploited resulting in the famous and brutal retrograde movement. Other interests  my father noted, were some of the  high ranking officers that lacked experience but were put in the command rotation merely to get experience regardless of their qualifications, he certainly does not mean everybody but enough who contributed to operation failures. Halberstam captures the feel for the front line troops very well and it is interesting that he describes Almond as a well taken care of martinet with his own elaborate personal trailer that followed his troop's movements. My father recounts a time when his outfit was pulled off the line for some RR in the rear and coming directly from a combat zone they were dressed down by an officer who chastised them for their lack of neat attire, it sounded like something out of a MASH episode where an authority figure with a total lack of awareness of real war conditions comes in conflict with those who actual are doing the fighting.  I guess there really were 'Major Burns' characters.

B00030EIXW|5.0|XXXXX<br /><br />Ludwig van Beethoven (1770 to 1827) created nine symphonies that are spiritual dramas of universal appeal.  In this DVD, two of them (composed before he was completely deaf) are performed by an orchestra led by \\"one of the most remarkable conductors of the twentieth century\\"--Carlos Kleiber (1930 to 2004), son of the late, great Austrian conductor Erich Kleiber.<br /><br />The first symphony performed is Symphony #4 in B flat major, opus 60.  The score was written in 1806.  It is characterized by it \\"deceptive lightness.\\"  Tempo of its movements is as follows:<br /><br />(1) Adagio - Allegro vivace<br />(2) Adagio<br />(3) Allegro vivace<br />(4) Allegro ma non troppo<br /><br />The second symphony is Symphony #7 in A major, opus 92.  Its score was written in 1811-12.  This symphony is \\"ruled by rhythm.\\"  For me, the Seventh seems to rival Beethoven's Fifth in its universal appeal.  It has four movements with the following tempos:<br /><br />(1) Poco sostenuto--Vivace<br />(2) Allegretto<br />(3) Presto--Assai meno presto<br />(4) Allegro con brio<br /><br />Each symphony is about 34 minutes long.<br /><br />Filming was live at the Concertgebouw, Amsterdam.<br /><br />I could see why Kleiber received such high accolades as a conductor.  He led the Cocertgebouw Orchestra with great passion and dynamic flare resulting in two unforgettable performances.<br /><br />Finally, the DVD itself (the one released in 2005) is perfect in sound and picture quality.<br /><br />In conclusion, this is a chance to see a great composer in action as he gives us his interpretation of two great symphonies!!<br /><br />(1983;  70 min;  full screen)<br /><br />&lt;&lt;Stephen Pletko, London, Ontario, Canada>><br /><br />XXXXX
0066620996|5.0|Two things make this one of the quintessential business books of our time.      1 - The book's conclusions are based on widespread, tested, and statistically proven observations, not personal theories.     Unlike most authors who write based upon their own experiences or those of a very limited number of other individuals, Collins' team spent years undertaking a massive and very well designed study examining thousands of companies. Their insights are fundamental, timeless truths of business which apply equally to your business and mine.     2 - It is written very clearly and makes for an easy read.     Many authors have good content, but few are able to express themselves in a simple, concise and easy to understand manner. Jim and his team hit the nail on the head despite the complexity of the issue covered.     If you are a business leader or would like to be one, this book is a must-read!     Marc Folch
B000VSBX34|1.0|Let's just say that some works don't hold up well over time.  This was little more than a poorly written 96 minute music video.  On a deeper level it is said to have reflected the growing despair that the Beatles felt as their career(s) took over their lives.  In any event, it comes across as forced, a hastily written script that gave the Beatles another go at the silver screen.  A Hard Day's Night was much better; it rocks while this one reeks.
B000VI70WM|5.0|I've been a Duran Duran fan for the past 24 yrs.  I have listen to the good, and the bad (Thank You, Pop Trash)and I have to say....This is there best sense the Wedding Ablum.

B000850IHW|5.0|This 1975 album has been referred to by musicologist John Covach as the most contrapuntal album in all of progressive rock.  While this could probably be said for many of their albums, Free Hand really is very complex and features some dazzlingly intricate counterpoint.  This album would be the last of its kind however, and although the follow-up In'terview (1976) is very good, it marked a point where Gentle Giant started to simplify their sound.  In general, I think the Gentle Giant sound was perfected on albums like The Power and the Glory (1974) and especially Free Hand.<br /><br />The lineup at this point included Gary Green (electric and acoustic guitars; Derek Shulman (saxes, lead and backing vocals); Ray Shulman (bass guitar; violin; acoustic guitar; backing vocals); Kerry Minnear (organ, piano, synthesizers, vibraphone; lead and backing vocals); and John Weathers (drums; percussion; and backing vocals).  The performances on Free Hand are very tight and the ensemble work is superb.  I like Kerry's use of synthesizers on the album too - although they are used sparingly, I like the addition of these tone colors.  There are some great vocal harmonies too and the mixture of medieval woodwind instruments and electric instruments is fantastic.<br /><br />Most of the tracks are in the 4 - 7 minute range with Talybont clocking in at 2:40.  Musically, this is a fine album and the tracks seem to be smoother - evidently the band had worked out the bugs by this point and the music flows.  The combination of classical music and rock is very well integrated - I think On Reflection is a good example of this and features a fugue at the opening and closing of the track.  There is also the use of short bits of melodies that are superimposed, creating a very intricate, dense sound. This is a technique apparently influenced by Stravinsky and Holst and is featured on a lot of Gentle Giant albums.  There is a lot of dynamic contrast too (His Last Voyage is a nice example of this).<br /><br />With respect to the remastering of this album by DRT, it is OK but there really is a lot of room for improvement.  The album features restored cover art and the lyrics to each track but there are not any historical notes or photos of the band - in short, the \\"perks\\" that make remastered efforts so much fun.  With respect to the bonus track of Just the Same, it was recorded in Calderone Theater in Hempstead, New York on July 3, 1976.  The sound quality is just OK and while it deviates little from the original the performance is great - the fact that these guys could pull this complicated material off live is very impressive).<br /><br />All in all, this is an excellent album by Gentle Giant and the last of their \\"full blown\\" prog albums.  Highly recommended along with Acquiring the Taste (1971); Three Friends (1972); Octopus (1973); In a Glass House (1973); The Power and the Glory; In'terview; and the live album Playing the Fool (1977).ct to the remastering of this album by DRT, it is OK but there really is a lot of room for improvement.

B000PMG16U|4.0|The thing about the original trilogy is that the picture quality has been maximized to its extent considering the quality of the original footage.  The audio can be replicated and enhanced, but the video quality would not be up to our standards of high def picture.

B000WQ9UA8|5.0|I'm one of the 5 people that rate this girl by her music not what the paparazzi makes her out to be. 95% of the things said about her is false and its completely ignorant. I saw a video of when they were filming her ordering food from the drive-thru. Who in this world goes that far to care what she orders? Thats sick. People need to leave her alone.    This album is crazy. I like her I don't give a F*ck, in your face attitude and style. The beats are sick.    Gimme More- 1st single, this song has been addicting since day one. Danja is definetly the next Timbaland. And Timbaland is a genius. It's too bad they didn't release the actual video.    Piece of Me- 2nd single, this song sums up her life that is right now. Its sad that she has to put up with all this scrutiny.    Radar- At first I wuz like hell no but I like this song now. Bloodshy & Avant are a good team.    Break The Ice- This is my 3rd favorite after Gimme More & Piece of Me. This should definetly be a single. Danja is gonna be huge.    Heaven On Earth- This is 1 of 2 outcasts of the album. It sounds very different. 80's vibe.     Get Naked- Danjas background vocals are crazy on this. The hook is very different from whats out there nowadays.    Freakshow- My 4th favorite.    Toy Soldier- Had to get used to it but I like it now.    Hot As Ice- I heard this song like april this year and i wuz hoping it wuz not the first single. Its a good album track but should not be a single.     Ooh Ooh Baby- Touch her and she comes alive. Lots of sexual energy. I like it haha.    Perfect Lover- Not the best but still good.    Why Should I Be Sad- This is the other outcast. This could have stayed off the album and they coulda made Get Back a album track instead of a bonus track. The Neptunes days are over. Their style has changed to an unpleasurable sound. This is the worst song of her career. I like the lyrics though.    This album is fire. At the end of the day Britney still can make a very good album even while under so much pressure. Rating: 97/100
B000WGNLLW|5.0|I've been a fan of this band from the beginning; own every album and I have to say this is an excellent album!    I must confess I had serious reservations about Duran working with Timberlake and Timbaland and count myself as a fan of the work of Andy Taylor. However, that being said, all concerns and doubt were quickly erased when I listened to this album in it's entirety.    It's one of Duran's best albums and I think that if some of these songs can get some airplay, Red Carpet Massacre will be a huge hit.    But, then again, that was the case with Astronaut as well. However, only  \\"Sunrise\\" got any airplay when there were at least two other radio-worthy songs on that album as well.    Time will tell how this one does.
B00005JPS5|3.0|I thought that I would never see<br />A movie based upon a bee<br /><br />The penguins really had their day<br />But now there's not much more to say<br /><br />So Jerry thought he'd do his thing<br />For busy bees that work and sting<br /><br />Extremely funny at the start<br />But by the end it lost the art<br /><br />Not even Ren&eacute;e could revive<br />A movie that just failed to thrive<br /><br />I really enjoyed the beginning of this movie, with Barry Bee Benson (Seinfeld) graduating after days and days of college, and getting his first taste of the workings of the hive with his friend Adam (Matthew Broderick).  After being told by the tour guide (Megan Mullally) that his first job will also be his last, he decides to take a look at the world outside the hive, and then the movie begins to go into decline.<br /><br />While on a routine pollen excursion, he has a close encounter with humans that prompts him to break a basic bee rule of keeping your mouth shut, and before long he's ingesting caffeine with a florist named Vanessa (Ren&eacute;e Zellweger) and chatting his way into an inter-species relationship.  One day, he discovers that humans have been harvesting honey in larger quantities than roaming bears have ever managed to gather, and decides to take the players in the honey industry to court.<br /><br />One kangaroo court case later, with Judge Oprah presiding, the movie reaches the bottom of the hive with an absolutely mind-bogglingly ridiculous grand finale that will give you an uncontrollable case of the \\"WHAT????'s\\"<br /><br />Sure, there are lots of funny one-liners and sight gags, and inside jokes, and lawyer jokes and innuendo, as well as a message about the importance of every individual to the big picture and the rewards of hard work, but overall, the movie boils down to \\"Oh, Jerry, where is your victory? Bee Movie, where is your sting?\\"<br /><br />Amanda Richards, November 17, 2007
0525950079|5.0|Others have given you the particulars.   If you loved \\"Pillars,\\" you'll revel in this semi-sequel.  It's extraordinarily engaging.  Each page is an indulgence into the almost alien world of the 1300's.  Follett brings the horrors of The Plague to light with vivid imagery.  I've bought many copies of \\"The Pillars of the Earth\\" to give to friends and students and all have loved it.  This is an equal to that epic tale in every way.  The attention to detail is remarkable; his characters are cast in all shades.  It's a wonderful read and it's too bad it's only 1000+ pages!
B000Y44LBG|4.0|Unfortunately for \\"American Gangster\\", it tells a story within a genre that has provided some of the richest contributions to pop culture over the last half century.  When holding Ridley Scott's foray into the world of the mob against most average films, \\"American Gangster\\" looks like a classic, but when compared to The Godfather, the crime films of Scorsese or even The Sopranos, this feature seems stuck in a pair of cement galoshes      \\"Gangster\\" details the meteoric rise and fall of Frank Lucas (Washington), a 1970s narcotics drug lord from Harlem.   In what could be a lesson in an introductory business class, the film shows how Lucas was able to create a monopoly in the drug world by providing a better product at a lower price.    A true capitalist innovator, Lucas achieved his bargain basement prices by eliminated the dozen or so buffers between the opium fields and the street.  He flew to Southeast Asia himself, bought his product and had his family sell it on the street.  With no skimmers taking a piece at each port, truck depot, or airfield, Lucas built a company that crushed his competition.       Because of the skills of Denzel Washington, Lucas is both monstrous and human.  His work ethic, creativity and dedication paint the picture of a man who could have been the CEO of a major company had life dealt him different cards.  Instead, he built an empire described as more powerful that the mafia.   His counterpart (and equal in many ways) is Richie Roberts (Crowe) the unrelenting by-the-book New Jersey cop who brought him down.       By casting these titans as leads, Scott is able to camouflage many of his flaws.  Washington and Crowe both deliver what for other actors would be career-defining performances, but \\"Gangster\\" doesn't offer the total package of other crime stories.  It lacks the humor and cinematic artistry of Goodfellas and The Sopranos and fails to grasp the regalness of The Godfather.  The most creative element of the film is the Scorsese-liketrailer with the retro sounds of Jay-Z`s  Heart of the City.  Many films would fail when compared to the best of the mob genre, so that does not mean \\"American Gangster\\" is without merit.  With two of America's finest actors at the top of their game and an irresistable story that brushes up against Vietnam, Ali and Nixon, the lack of creativity on the part of Ridley Scott is all that's keeping this from being one of the best films of the decade.

B000QFAJ7S|5.0|Kelly's My December is a very introspective look at her life.  It is different from the hard thumping tunes of Breakaway (which I love) but for me, this CD is so much better.  It travels a journey of her life with rock songs & soft ballads.  Kelly is a great songwriter.  Her talents are endless, and anyone who loved Breakaway will adore My December.  This CD can accompany an intensive workout as well as invoke tenderness with a loved one.  How many CD's out there can give you the best of both worlds?  Sober, Haunted, Irvine, Chivas (hidden track), these songs epitomize Kelly's growth as an artist, singer, songwriter.  Kelly is the best to come out of A.I. along with Carrie Underwood.
B000WTLDPU|5.0|This movie was much better than I expected.  It is quirky, funny, and pretty creative.  I would recommend this film to anyone whole likes a good fantasy movie.
B000MXPE7O|5.0|A great movie. On the surface, it is about the founding of the CIA, going back to the OSS (WWII spy agency). At the core, it is about how someone losses their soul, bit by bit; and, lives a life less full than it could have been. I was surprised that I liked it, as I normally not very interested in spy movies. While there is some killing, it is not the focus of the movie; rather what is important is inner destruction. Effectively jumps around in time, which is something that I normally do not like; but well and usefully done here. Outstanding performances by everyone who has a speaking role, particularly Matt Damon and Angelina Jolie who give understated performances. There is a bit of background that was clearly shown, but might not be well understood: Yale University has a secret society called Skull & Bones; most of the early US spy aristocracy came from it, including the first President Bush.

087349976X|5.0|I purchased this book after looking through it at a crafts store and think it is just great. There are a lot of 'do-able' projects for the beginner to advanced level.  The book contains basic fundamentals to get  you started on the beginning to intermediate level, and clear photographs of all the projects. It does not spoon feed step by step instruction beyond that. Some reviewers have disagreed with this, they want the step by step. However, once you have mastered the basics of wire work much more instruction isn't really needed. Many pieces can be figured out by the photos alone. The value of this book lies in the inspiration it provides you, the wire artist, to look beyond someone elses work and become original with your own pieces.
B000NA2BEU|4.0|Veronica Mars was an awesome show.  I had to watch the first two seasons on DVD because I was UPN-less but it quickly became an all-time favorite.  While the third season wasn't up to par with the first two, it was still better than a lot of what was on TV.  And I still miss the show.  I highly recommend it to anyone.  It's not a teen show in the least--it's very unique.
B000MR9D5E|5.0|[[ASIN:B000MR9D5E Planet Earth - The Complete BBC Series]]    Prepare to be awed! Not only is the camera work spectacular but also the editing. My only complaints, which are really minor, are (1) transistions are a bit ragged between where commercial breaks had occurred and the documentary and (2) the long lead-in time (titles, intro text, etc.) should have been on the first disc only--it's tiresome to listen to it all five times. We loved it so much that my three adult children are getting the complete Planet Earth Series for Christmas this year.

B000VLE3GA|5.0|The double-disc set MotherShip by Led Zeppelin is an amazing and powerful compiltation of the band's historic sound. The remastering on this is far better than early/latter days and the tracklist is for that matter. You basically have the first complete essential Led Zeppelin album where if you had no clue who the band was, this would be the only CD you would ever need. (no offense to LZ fanatics). If you are a fanatic, get the DVD bonus version. Otherwise, this is REALLY where Led needs to stop with the compiltations. By the way, I bet another live album is on the way, so keep your eyes peeled.
B00013RC8O|5.0|This movie is one of the best ever produced during the '70's. Right from the start, it's obvious that it's a counter-culture, don't trust \\"the man\\" movie. I saw it when it first came out in the theaters and now I can enjoy it anytime I want on CD. The ending is absolutely the best part of the movie.

B00081912E|5.0|Like others reviewing this DVD I am not a big Jim Carey fan. He does create a sympathetic character in this movie. This is the first movie that I remember seeing Cameron Diaz and her beauty in this film is breathtaking. For me however an unmentioned hero in other reviews is the dog. The dog saves the day and actually gets the mask on his face and then everybody has to Watch Out! The film is worth a watch. :-)
B000NA2BEU|5.0|This is a good series, with good writing and an interesting group of characters. The resemblance to Buffy The Vampire Slayer is obvious, except Veronica has perceptive powers and a taser. Well worth watching.
B000GFLE86|5.0|Yes, for just one song, Joni Mitchell's \\"River\\" this album deserves pure five stars. Peyroux's voice is so fragile and humble with Lang's one melodic and strong without overpowering. Sheer pleasure for vocal lovers.     But there is more. I could never figure out that somebody can sing \\"Summer Wind\\" after Frank Sinatra covered it. Frank is of course always perfect. Yet, Madeleine's version is equally good. She has a naturally swinging voice and it shows. Leonard Cohen's songs are real delight, especially \\"Half the Perfect World\\", sung by Madeleine almost jokingly. And Charlie Chaplin's \\"Smile\\" ends the set. Bravo!
055358894X|2.0|This book probably deserves three stars, but I was so disappointed after having read so many glowing reviews that I can't help but give it a lower rating!  The main character doesn't seem to have any substance at all.  He's supposed to be extremely clever, witty, and street-smart, but he makes mistake after mistake in his adventures, getting his friends killed in the process.  I found the one-liners to be inappropriate and annoying.  The swearing doesn't bother me too much, I just didn't feel any respect or sympathy for the main character.  It's not really the same type of literature, but you might try Robin Hobb's Farseer series if you're looking for something better.
B000002UB6|4.0|Just ask a trivia question: \\"Name a rock album with three Number 1 hits. To make it easier to guess, band members considered this album a failure\\". Certainly you know the answer. At the same time, it is still a four stars production. Quality of the songs is superb, just to mention the \\"Long and Winding Road\\", which has become a karaoke favorite for so many. Paul's voice shines on this one just like on \\"Get Back\\". He really could do wonders with both ballads and rockers. George has fun playing blues and John dreams about the \\"Universe\\".     I agree with all reviewers who like Phil Spector's version instead of the \\"Naked\\" one. \\"Naked\\" truly makes the album exposed while Spector's female choirs (a first on any Beatles album) and orchestras add a very needed polish and substance to otherwise modest production. Another proof that George Martin was a badly desired but absent when making \\"Let It Be\\".
B000C65Z1G|5.0|My wife and I just finished watching The Constant Gardener.  I was so impressed I came straight to Amazon to write a review.  I ordered it for 2 reasons:<br /><br />1.  John LeCarre always tells a good story, full of intrigue (remember \\"Smiley's People\\", \\"Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy\\" and \\"The Honorable School Boy\\"?  LeCarre's characters may be fiction but the overall plot and point of his literary work is always based on truth, fact, and his real-life experiences in the British \\"Foreign Service\\".<br /><br />2.  Ralph Fiennes might not be able to pronounce his own first name correctly (Rafe?) but he is incapable of a bad performance; the man is a brilliant actor.<br /><br />This film is beautifully shot, the acting is fantastic, the locations are incredible, the story is first-rate LeCarre, and it has a great musical score to boot.  What more could you possibly want?<br /><br />It's impossible to walk away from this film saying that it was enjoyable.  It wasn't.  Like Blood Diamonds, it was full of disturbing and heart wrenching realities. Sadly there is no denying the continued exploitation of third world peoples for profit whether it be for precious stones, drugs, weapons sales, etc.  I feel sorry for anyone who can watch this and not be moved b the plight of those people and does not feel very fortunate that they do not have to endure such an existence.<br /><br />The Constant Gardener is full of well-paced suspense.  It is a fairly long film (over 2.5 hours) but it did not seem that long.  This film is very worthy of 5 stars and YOUR attention.  Those who would \\"dis\\" this film were either made very uncomfortable by the sad and outrageous truth, or would not know a great film if it walked up and bit 'em on the backside.
B000VBJEFK|5.0|I recently snapped up a Sony PS3 because I didn't want to wait any longer for the format war to end and had established that Blu Ray was far better than HD and selling much more anyway. I have not been disappointed! This movie just pins exactly what Blu Ray is all about and delivers crystal clear animation with a wonderful depth of audio. It adds so much more to an animated masterpiece such as this and is worth every cent! I'm glad I took the plunge because I am enjoying movies so much more now.
0743270754|5.0|Excellent review of his political years. Clarifies many of the issues and the people involved in the end of slavery. Good background of the people he surrounded himself with in his administration. Exellent history of the civil war and the politics behind the 13th amendment.
0805028846|4.0|Good book in that it tells a lot of various methods for making pop up's and shows example and tells you to prctice and gives good advise if you are a beginner. Doesn't have many practical ideas though for beginners. All examples are with heart motifs and other examples of pop ups made are obviously for someone who has lots of experience as they are really impressive and took lots of practice. No way a beginner could make those. Overall a good book though as it has lots of instructions.
B0002Y69NG|4.0|It's always a weary thing when ordering something online. Your mind goes all over the place imagining the product to be in shambles by the time you get to it. This product though, was in very good condition (also with its original wrapping). I was very pleased.
B000Q9IZ5C|5.0|I'm not sure how to justify buying this dvd after getting the other and the whole series.  I guess I just need more of it.  I was there since the beginning and I'll continue being there to support this great show.  Ebbert and the other guy gave the movie two thumbs up, so it must be better than your average space movie.  OOOh, I'm sorry IT IS better than your average movie for all those thing every body is saying.
B00007E8V4|4.0|\\"Steal This Album!\\" was the last major System of a Down release that I didn't own, and so I finally thought I should pick it up in order to complete my SOAD collection.    The album, essentially, is just what it sounds like: good but not fantastic, one that didn't really need a cover because it obviously didn't matter as much to the band as some of the previous recordings. The songs range from the fast-and-short energy bursts that we know to the longer, more intricately-layered tracks. The problem is, the shortest tracks are a bit too brief, while the longer songs don't flow and move with the same energy than other SOAD tracks like \\"Aerials\\" and \\"Spiders\\". The sixteen songs (at a few points) contrast too sharply between the two types of songs, and the album seems uneven, especially about a third of the way in, where the CD's fast start quickly slows down with longer songs like \\"Mr. Jack and \\"Highway Song\\". There aren't quite enough slower tracks and too many burst-of-energy tracks.    Now, this said, Toxicity is one of my favorite CDs by anyone; therefore, if you like Toxicity, you will like this one as well. Even at the first listen, I could make out similarities between some of the tracks on each album (compare \\"Nuguns\\" to \\"Deer Dance\\", \\"F**k the System\\" to \\"X\\", and \\"Boom!\\" to \\"Prison Song\\"). The energy in most of these songs is classic System and the heavy riffs with Serj Tankian's barking and bellowing move the album along with such speed that it feels like the band's shortest album. Tracks 8-12 make up the best part of the album.    This is a good album, and even though I thought the album's progression was a bit uneven with the contrast in song length, it is an enjoyable listen. It's not as superb as Toxicity, but it works if you're bored of everything else they've put out.
0810945797|5.0|I didn't grow up with \\"The Dark Crystal\\" like most others who bought this book.  I watched it for the first time in 2007.  While I found the movie charming, it didn't leave much of an impression.  Still, I was fascinated with just how so powerfully so many people love this movie.  The film has such a following that a sequel is on the way after 25 years.  So, I bought this book to see what it was I was missing.  This book is mostly written from the point of view of Aughra, one of the main characters in the film.  The art is fantastic but what I adored was the mythology I found within these pages.  In this book is a vivid history of the world of the Dark Crystal, complete with philosophical and religious ideas that have a strong connection to the events of the film.  If you wish to understand the films themes and events better, there is no better book than this.  A MUST for all fans of \\"The Dark Crystal\\"
B00005JO20|3.0|What good are spectacular effects if you're asleep by the time they arrive?<br />Ridiculously poor editing makes this a third longer than it should be. So many long pans over lavish sets as if to say, look at all the effort we went to, instead of trying to tell the story and move it along. Major continuity issues surface at various points to add to the mess.<br />Some stunning visual moments, but in the end I didn't care as I was bored stiff an hour in and realizing more than two were left. Some really B-movie moments, too. Cheesy script and not one exceptional performance add up to snoresville in my book, even if the ape came off the screen and sat beside me. He'd start snoozin' too, I bet.
B0001IMD2Y|2.0|I was really excited to finally sit down and watch this as I always enjoyed the first two Terminator movies. So this is not a review from someone who hates cheesy unrealistic sci fi or action films.    I was really disappointed by the:    1) Plot  2) Script  3) Acting  4) Pace    There were some cool special effects and a hilarious chase scene, but overall the movie is terrible! Its worth watching if you were a Terminator fan, but don't get your hopes up that it will add anything significant to the previous two stories. It would have been interesting to go forward into the future and focus on the wars against the machines.
B000MXPE7O|3.0|3.5 stars<br /><br />This film just bites off more than most any movie could ever chew. It should be lauded for its ambition, but it's just too slow and sprawling to really move the viewer as much as it wants to.<br /><br />Damon is good but not great, and never made me care much for his character. Same for Jolie and most everyone else. Not a great script, but I applaud the effort to inject some truth into the many CIA myths out there. The MK-Ultra scene was quite interesting. Anyone who's read some the books by ex-agents will recognize some enlightening little tid-bits; the cynicism generated by playing both sides against the middle comes through nicely.<br /><br />In the end, however, close but no cigar. The definitive Agency film has yet to be made. But then, that might be far too much truth for the kool-aid drinkers to grasp...
B00005R8GU|5.0|I purchased this album when it first came out.  I have owned a copy, in one form or another, for over thirty-five years.  To my mind this is the quintessential example of Chicago Blues and is an amalgemation of all that went before it.  The studio work is flawless but full of feeling.  The live material is the best live Muddy I've ever heard, including Newport.       I think the greatest revelation on this album that is full of them, is Paul Butterfield.  I had just started to play harp when I first bought this record and Butter became my favorite player then, and has remained so.  Over the years I've seen him in concert many times and owned just about everything he played on, his own and others' records, legitiment and bootleg recordings.  This is the best work he ever did.  Succinct, soulful, eloquent, technically perfect, his playing on this is beyond compare.  I rate his solo on \\"Same Thing\\" with \\"Claire de Lune\\", Hendrix's \\"Drifting\\", \\"La Boehme\\", \\"Amazing Grace\\".       Should you purchase this cd make sure you have time to listen to it without being interrupted by phone, kids, etc.  It deserves that level of attention and you'll be glad you did.
B000VLE3IS|5.0|Okay here tis',another Led Zeppelin best of set,(2 CD's and a DVD),while nothing is new here,the sounds and sights are still incredible,thanks to awesome remastering,all these years later!!!The only quibble i have here is with the shoddy packaging(cardboard w/sleeves),the CD's and DVD(the booklet is also in a sleeve,but booklets don't scratch,nice booklet though,with great liner notes,track info and photos!)!) gets sctatched when you try to remove it from it's sleeve,not such a great thing,I now suggest putting them in empty jewel cases to prevent further damage,if you can live without the DVD,a 2 CD set(same great songs!) is also available with better packaging(a plastic Super Jewel Box case!)Absolute classic rock n roll!!! The five stars is for the performances,NOT the packaging!!! Two thumbs up!!! Way Up!!! A+
B000KZ3BWE|5.0|Having read the book and seen the video, I am determined to help get the message out.  Facts and examples presented one after another force the viewer/reader to see what we all wish weren't so--life on our planet is endangered. We need to act. Now. So I am buying and giving away books and videos, asking people to \\"Read/view this and pass it on.\\" I drive a Prius, and when people ask me about my car, I bring out the book, opening first to the page that addresses their bggest question.  Thank you, Al Gore, for providing such a straight forward and user-friendly presentation.

0812550757|5.0|Speaker for the Dead is the sequel to Ender's Game, although they are very different books and it's hard to compare them, the second Speaker is the one I favor.  It is easier to get attached to the characters and since they aren't just little boys and instead represent a larger cross section of people in general it seems to more accessible to a non-sifi fan.    Either way both are great and you should read them!
B000PMGS8G|4.0|I've never liked my science fiction funny... nor have I cared much for camp either, but this one got it down right.<br /><br />The 1980s version of 'Flash Gordon' had a lot going for it. Big sets and costumes, big name actors like Max Von Sydow, Brian Blessed, Timothy Dalton (pre-James Bond), Peter Wyngard and Topol. Sydow was the perfect Ming the Merciless. I cannot imagine anyone else playing the role like he did!<br /><br />The remaining cast were largely unknowns and filled the roles nicely too. And of course, one cannot talk about this film without mentioning Queen's contribution to the soundtrack. Their music added a perfect element to all this campiness.<br /><br />I can only think of one other genre that did camp just right (the 1960s Batman). Interestingly enough, there is a connection between the two: Writer Lorenzo Semple, Jr., wrote for both productions.<br /><br />Sure, the movie is over the top! The sets are colorful and splashy with no logic whatsoever; the special effects also colorful are not  convincing in the least (just like the original), yet somehow the movie captures the innocence of the original 1930s serial.<br /><br />One piece of interesting trivia regarding the film is that lead actor Sam Jones and film producer extraordinaire Dino De Laurentis had a huge quarrel over some issue during the film's production. In retaliation, De Laurentis had Jones' dialogue completely dubbed over with another actor's (name unknown) voice.<br /><br />'Flash Gordon' is one of those films where you sit back, (and using one of the lines from the movie) \\"strap yourself down\\" and go with the silliness! It is sexy, entertaining, silly and heck of a lot of fun!
B000NA2BEU|5.0|So as you can tell from the title I\\"m a huge V. Mars fan. The main question is why aren't you?  Season 3 has more snappy comebacks, more edgy plot lines , and more adultish situations.  By no means is Veronica a push over but there are situations where she is \\"put in her place\\" in a more adult sense than when she was in High School.  All in all the third season is both more and less realistic.  In both cases however it is totally awesome and in my opinion better than the first two seasons in the show has progressed to this point naturally.  Someone should slap the faces of every WB exec who voted to cancel this show it was really beginning to come into it's own.  Anyone who liked the girl let cast of Buffy and other such shows should be watching Veronica Mars!
B000W4HJ44|5.0|Hairspray was one of the few movies in the summer of 2007 that really just took me by surprise. I walked in expecting just another musical and came out feeling on top of the world. Now i will say, i have never seen the 1988 original or the broadway musical, so while i can't say this is the best adaptation of Hairspray, i say it comes pretty darn close.<br /><br />The premise of the story is relativly simple. A plus-sized girl named Tracey Turnblad (the delightfull Nikky Blonksi) dreams of dancing on the huge TV hit the Corney Collins show but naturally, she faces challenges from the vindictive show producer (Pfeiffer vamping it up) and falling in love with the most talented dancer on the show.<br /><br />The muscial numbers were great, both campy, full of energy and inspiring, particularily the final number \\"You Can't Stop The Beat\\", which had me tapping my feet and my heart soar. Not only that but the movie was hilarious! I found my self laughing so hard at certain points and it has been awhile since a movie has made me laugh so hard. All the actors are great, some impressing me more then others. First off, who can honestly say that they knew Amanda Bynes could sing? And as for Travolta as the mom? A piece of casting genius. This is probally his best role since Pulp Fiction (and no, i ain't lying).<br /><br />This is the kind of movie that proves there can be more to the summer then just big-budget flicks and fancy effects. This proves a movie can make you sing, dance, and feel like on top of the world.<br /><br />Hairspray is by far, one of the best films of the summer.

0374280967|5.0|This slim little novella takes about a minute and a half to read, and is the most delightful story I've read in a long time. When Her Majesty, out on walkies with her corgis, stumbles upon a traveling library, she checks out  a volume to avoid seeming rude. Her following transformation into a reader and, in the process, into a better human, is laugh-out-loud funny and touching at the same time, an experience this particular very common reader absolutely loved.
0226752275|5.0|for the people who hated this book and gave it poor reviews. Really missed out on what may be the greatest novel of all time. For me it's hard to put down. And the themes are deep and everlasting ones that humans will forever struggle with. Life and death, God vs science, good and evil, spiritual themes, and social ones also, all wrapped up in a GREAT story. Oh well, you can't expect everyone to get it and resonate with it.<br /><br />One thing about this Rieger version: it says it \\"reproduces for the first time in more than a century the text of the first edition published in 1818\\". Not true. Donohue produced at least three editions (I have them) around 1895 that are all the 1818 text.<br />Just an FYI.<br /><br />Believe the hype! This book is hard to surpass. I virtually never give 5 stars to ANYTHING. This deserves it.
B00068TJM6|4.0|I must first say that I am extremely happy with the design and quality feel of the watch. Really the only concern I have is that the warranty card was not filled out by the seller. According to SEIKO the card must be filled out with watch s/n and case s/n as well as the merchant identifier. The case s/n was not available, nor was the store information... I would assume by this, there is no warranty.
B000V6BE6C|5.0|Since the release of City of Evil, Avenged Sevenfold has been crucified for knocking off the kings of 80's metal. With their latest self-titled effort, they haven't mimicked their idols; they just may have become them for their generation.       Avenged Sevenfold is bigger than its categorical brethren in every way. The ungodly solos, the intricate measure for measure harmonizing, the heart-attack drum licks and huge chorus' all make for a career defining performance.       Kicking off the album with their heaviest track to date is \\"Critical Acclaim.\\" After an organ intro that sounds as if listeners are passing through cemetery's gates and some sleek guitar work that paints the path to come, the track explodes into metal mayhem with double bass and give and take guitar chugging not heard since a certain Vulgar Display of Power. Vocalist M. Shadows' lyrical rant is easily the most delicious liberal call-out heard in years.       \\"Critical Acclaim\\" also unleashes A7X's newest vocal talent - The Rev. His \\"Sebastian Bach on heroine\\" vocal styling is interesting to say the least and plays an important role throughout the album.       The classic thrash of \\"Almost Easy\\" continues the upbeat journey, complete with trip-licks courtesy of The Rev and a monster chorus. Following suit is \\"Scream,\\" which possesses an extremely dark vibe, complimented with one of the most interesting ascensions and dissensions of scale heard to date.       \\"Afterlife\\" proves to be the first explicit differentiation, as it opens with mournful strings and paints a heavy picture of the young dying and trying to escape the afterlife in hopes of resurrecting what was lost. This fascinating display of self-examination and self-regret ends with the most impressive Synyster Gates solo yet.       \\"Gunslinger\\" is yet another dissension, as it starts off with M. Shadows delivering smooth vocals, only accompanied by a plucky, acoustic Gates riff. The Southern Rock vibe is strangely welcome and the moment inwhich the strings go electric is the kind of thing that raises goose bumps.       Shadows' vocals throughout the album are smoother and more melodic than ever before. He has truly come into his own, developing a sound similar to that of Phil Anselmo of the now defunct Pantera.       \\"A Little Piece of Heaven\\" is an absolute triumph. With the help of Danny Elfman's go-to guys Oingo Boingo, it sounds as if it's the center-piece of a yet-to-come Tim Burton epic. The dark, yet circusy vibe, complete with full orchestration, vocal give-and-take between Shadows and The Rev. and A7X's darkest lyrics to date add up to undoubtedly the biggest accomplishment of their career.       Concluding the ride is \\"Dear God,\\" an outright country track. Somehow Avenged manage to pull this off, creating their most heartfelt song to date. It obviously wouldn't be an Avenged track without a solo, which is provided over the last minute of this monster country ballad.       \\"Dear God/ the only thing I ask of you is to hold her when I'm not around/ when I'm much too far away/ we all need that person who can be true to you/ I left her when I found her/ And now I wish I'd stayed,\\" sings Shadows.       Avenged Sevenfold is a career-defining album. This self-produced masterpiece reaches heights not even remotely envisioned within the parameters of today's metal genre. This is a musical journey that will not soon be forgotten.
B0001XALTG|2.0|Ummm, I remember hearing about this movie when I was an undergrad back in '96. I didn't get to watch it back then, but I finally have been able to see the movie. All I can think is that I am 30 something, and this didn't appeal to me. The humor was off the mark for me a bit, but I still couldn't say that the movie is bad. Its just for the younger crowd. So if you are 20ish, it will be good for you.
B00012QM8G|5.0|I have seen this movie many times,but it has been awhile.<br />I just rewatched it, and felt compelled to write a review on it.<br /><br />The movie is Stephen Spielberg's masterpiece on the Holocaust, and it is a totally unforgetable movie.<br />The acting is AWESOME, and the fact that it is shot in black and white only adds to the authenticity of it.<br /><br />The main character is Oskar Schindler, a nazi-German living in Poland during WW2.<br />Although he was a womanizer, and a nazi, he also had great feeling for the Jewish prisoners, and saved thousands of them from sure death, just by coming to work for him in his factory...<br />Schindler Jews were treated MUCH better than other Jewish prisoners of this time period.<br /><br />What really boggles my mind about the Holocaust is that these atrocities done to the Jewish people happened in fairly MODERN times...it is just hard to get over that fact, and especially while watching this movie, and seeing jews shot and killed for such unbelivably small things like looking a nazi in the eye, or talking out of turn...it is just unbelivable.<br /><br />Anyway, the movie basically focuses on Oskar Schindler, and how he helped these people along the way.He fed them right, and did not beat them or abuse them in other ways. He also let them practice thier religion which was UNTHINKABLE back then,<br /><br />And most importantly, he let them all go when the war was over, and that was where the list comes in.<br />He and his loyal secretary and friend (a jew), made a list that<br />broke Schindler by \\"buying\\" over a thousand Jews who would have surely died, as most jews did in the end.<br /><br />This movie has so many unforgettable scenes in it.One in particular was where hundreds of Schindler's women were mistakenly misrouted to the wrong camp, and they were horrified.They were supposed to meet thier husbands and children at schindler's camp, but ended up all stripped down and loaded into what they thought was a gas chamber.<br />When water (instead of gas) came pouring out on them they all cried in relief. It was terrible.<br /><br />The train scene was also VERY disturbing. The jews were packed like sardines into railroad cars waiting to ride, on the hottest day imaginable.They were actually baking alive in the cars. Schindler ordered fire hoses to be turned on the cars, and water to be given to them.<br />These small acts of kindness is actually what saved many lives.<br /><br />Again I say this movie is probably the most important movie ever made.It is a dark piece of history,yet it needs to be looked at, and never forgotten.Modern day Jewish people STILL flock to visit Oskar Schindler's grave, and leave a stone on it.<br /><br />As for Mr. Schindler;<br />On the night his Jews were freed, he became a fugitive himself.in relief.

B000056VJ7|1.0|If you would ever want to defend [[ASIN:0679737294 Rolling Stone]], their 1992 review of \\"Bat Out Of Hell\\" should be your start. the tenth biggest-selling album in my home city of Melbourne during the 1970s, \\"Bat Out Of Hell\\" has caused me no end of irritation ever since I first heard it on the radio when Australian radio in the ealy to middle 1990s was fixated with \\"classic rock\\" from long before I was born.<br /><br />David Keenan, a brilliant and extremely eccentric critic from the Scottish magazine-with-an Australian-namesake \\"The Sunday Herald\\", listed \\"Bat Out Of Hell\\" as one of the \\"Best Albums Ever...Honest\\" in 2003, saying \\"here his [Todd Rundgren's] restless logic works just fine, supported by a metallic backbone that keeps things driving throughout the most convoluted of arrangements\\". Although I have nothing but respect for Keenan, especially his appreciation of such touching masterworks as [[ASIN:B00004R7TP Kate Bush's Hounds of Love]] and [[ASIN:B000002GFT Fairport Convention's Liege & Lief]], I cannot agree with him here.<br /><br />Like the worst of 1970s glam-rock, \\"Bat Out Of Hell\\" actually has nothing but the shallowest emotional impact even when the music is at its fastest. Rundgren's production may actually keep it in check because later Meatloaf  albums were - believe it or not - even worse in their melodramatic tone. The changes of tempo are so obvious and deliberately contrived that they lose all emotional impact. \\"Paradise by the Dashboard Light\\" and \\"Bat Out of Hell\\" are so catchy that even children will sing along, it does not eliminate the absence of feeling and depth in the playing or the fact that songs which should never be put together as one piece are fused in a manner that could never work.<br /><br />The simpler power balladry of \\"You Took The Words Right Out Of My Mouth\\" and \\"Two Out of Three Ain't Bad\\" paved the way for Bryan Adams to conquer the world in the 1980s and 1990s, and manage to sound as bad as Adams ever did because of the soppy vocals, which permeate even the rockers and are far worse than [[ASIN:B0000026E5 Springsteen]] or [[ASIN:B000065AI3 Petty]] could imaginably be. the lyrics are as self-conciously funny as any band could ever be, but should be seem as laughable by anyone wiht the lsightest maturity in their musical tastes.<br /><br />Bluntly put, it is impossible to imagine a record so childishly overdone and contrived as \\"Bat Out Of Hell\\". Lacking any emotion or depth, this is a record that sold by the tens of thousands in Australia but is very hard to listen to even by the standards of the most pompous rock.h permeate even the rockers and are far worse than [[ASIN:B0000026E5 Springsteen]] or [[ASIN:B000065AI3 Petty]] could imaginably be. the lyrics are as self-conciously funny as any band could ever be, but should be seem as laughable by anyone wiht the lsightest maturity in their musical tastes.

B000UX6THK|5.0|I was a little late to catch Twin Peaks on TV, I remembering seeing a couple of episodes and not understanding what was going one.  It's not just age; in a series such as this you can't just drop in halfway and expect to understand it all.    The series begins with the building of the characters and establishment of the town.  I had watched a second hand copy of my old college roommate's on video, so I had watched the show all the way through.  What I didn't get to appreciate is the beautiful Cinematography and complex yet patterned Sound Design that this show boasts.  This show is a film that was made into a series, meaning that David Lynch and the other creators of the show brought in Film standards when making this show, they got good actors, established dialog, shot on film and most importantly shot on location.  It makes all the difference.  Since I now live in Seattle, not too far from the actual location this show was shot at. And this show is able to capture that northwest feel, that's unique to the mountains and valleys of the area.  Something that so many shows would have ignored as they shot in a studio (ie; Grey's Anatomy).    The restoration of the film negative brought to the DVD it beautiful, the remixing to digital audio does the show justice, the first couple of episodes I was wondering why I was hearing a faint whistle blow of a factory every 5 mins.  Listen for it; it becomes a constant and comforting audio motif as you get sucked into this bizarre town.    I definitely recommend this show and the set to anyone who wants a challenging, insightful and thoughtful murder/mystery that far exceeds the drivel on TV today.  It's a rare triumph of a film director that wanted to try his skill in a different medium.  Though let's just hope Michael Bay doesn't make a cop show or we're in trouble.
0385751532|5.0|An interesting and welcoming angle to take which surely can't fail to make children (and adults) think about the horror of the death camps. Although Bruno himself isn't aware of the ironies, the reader certainly is.<br /><br />Because the story is told through nine year old Bruno, the author is able to use childish descriptions to explain his experiences and observations. The reader has more understanding than Bruno and so his innocence and ignorance of the situation make the events all the more poignant.

B000006NUW|5.0|The Motown Hits Collection is absolutely marvelous! It is a varied  collection of memories and history of music in the 60's and 70's from the African-American perspective. It is music for those who enjoy excellent musical arrangements,clear and wholesome lyrics, and music that is filled with love and inspiration from the Motown writers, arrangers, and singers. Above all, it is tribute to Barry Gordy who founded Motown when our world was in racial and political turmoil. He reached in and made some sense of it all. Thanks to him, Smoky Robinson, Holland-Dozier-Holland, Ashford and Simpson, The Miracles, Marvin Gaye, Tammi Terell, Kim Weston, Mary Wells, Brenda Holloway, The Marvelettes, Martha and The Vanellas, Stevie Wonder, The Supremes, The Temptations, Gladys Knight and The Pips, Diana Ross, and many others for making this magnificant music that we have today. This music is timeless and universal. It's guaranteed to please, to soothe, to stimulate, to conjure up memories, and to entertain your deepest sense of pleasure. Sit back, quiet your mind, listen, snap your fingers, stomp your feet as you journey into a galaxy of historical and musical delight.
B00004YA0T|5.0|I have listened to Bruckner for more years than I'd care to admit, but these recordings by Eugen Jochum are like hearing him for the first time.  It is startling how good these recordings are, and what freshness Jochum brings to the more familiar Bruckner offerings...the 3rd, 4th, 7th, 8th and 9th.  Electrifying is not too strong a word to describe them.  In addition, these EMI recordings are an astonishing value.  Buy and listen for yourself.  I dare you not to be transfigured by the music-making.
B000WQ9UA8|5.0|Britney's best CD and the first one you can listen to from start to finish. There are no duds. Some are better than others...and there are a lot of great one's here. Sure her voice is vocodered but this is state of the art dance music and it works. She's even edgy - something that she was not able to pull of with her last CD \\"In the Zone\\"...remember Outrageous \\"her shopping sprees - Outrageous!\\" The lyrics aren't that stupid this time around. And \\"Gimme More\\" is just the start...it's gets better. \\"Piece of Me\\" - fun tabloid bashing with clever lyrics, \\"Break the Ice\\", \\"Heaven on Earth\\" - hot dance songs. Then \\"Get Naked (I Got a Plan) - this could be a club smash. Freakshow - quirky beats, \\"Hot as Ice\\" kind of cheesy - sort of eighties sound - but fun and could be her next \\"Toxic\\" hit. \\"Ooh Ooh Baby\\" samples Gary Glitter to make a dance anthem. The songs are well produced and there's a lot going on in them - some songs have two hooks going on at once, strange background moaning in \\"Piece of Me\\". This is a fun dance party album so it never gets deep (except for the last song \\"Why Shoud I Be Sad\\") - the rest of time it's all about sex, excess and fun. She plays up her sex kitten image all the way through. The music's production is like a cross between dramatic Eurodisco and Dr. Dre. It's the best pop CD to come out in a long time - and as good as the beats are, you can sing to them too. Maybe during all that club hopping she's been taking notes.

B000VI6T6U|3.0|If you already have this on DVD from Criterion then there's no need to rush out and get this.  In the past, Experience Hendrix has done a great job of supplementing their DVDs with great behind-the-scenes docs or additional material.  The Band of Gypsies and Woodstock being prime examples, where the docs run almost twice as long as the performances.  While the extras on this are good (read other reviews for details), they simply don't justify the extra expense, in my opinion.  Yes this is one of the most legendary rock performances ever caught on film, and it's nice to have the extra angles but  in comparison to the other Experience Hendrix releases, I felt sorta ripped off after the half hour or so it took to watch this DVD.
B000N4SHOE|5.0|This film was an absolute pleasure to watch (more than once) and it has been an absolute pleasure to read so many favourable reviews.  If any film deserved praise this is the one.

B000W1V5VU|1.0|Ocean's 11 was a great film, Ocean's 12 and now 13 however are two of the most narcissistc, vain showboats I have ever seen. There is no point to Ocean's 13 - it is vacuous and has one of the most absurd plots you'll be likely to see. It is again just a vehicle for Pitt, Clooney et al to be paid  to have a good time, without worrying about making a good film.    My friend bought this on DVD, he may as well have simply posted £15 down the drain. What a waste of time. If you buy it, don't say I didn't warn you.

0151013047|2.0|The beginning of this novel set the stage for some terrific action. The main character, a Princeton graduate, takes up a job at a unique business that specializes in pricing other businesses. He has about all that an immigrant can ask for in the American dream, and with the nature of the title, you think that this is going to turn into some fantastic questioning about American values and capitalism. It was a great foundation that totally fell through. He hardly explores any doubts about what his loyalties are, and he never gives any indication about becoming a fundamentalist, much less a reluctant one. Don't be duped by the interesting title (like I was). There is no substance to this story.
B000UGG3A0|3.0|Overview: This album is #6 for this Boston based Celtic-punk band. A lot has happened since the release of their first album, \\"Do Or Die\\" back in 1998. They lost their original lead singer, Mike McColgan in 1999 just after the band had won over the modern punk rock scene. They have managed to successfully continue on with their current lead singer, Al Baar. They also picked up some fame with several music fans outside of the punk rock movement thanks to their appearances on the Conan O'Brien show, The Jimmy Kimmell show, and an appearance on \\"The Departed\\" soundtrack with their song, \\"Shipping Up To Boston.\\" They have also re-written the anthems for both The Boston Red Sox, and The Boston Bruins. This album is also their first release on a major label after departing Rancid's Hellcat Records.<br /><br />Pros: Dropkick Murphys have returned to a sound similar to the sound they used on their 3rd album, \\"Sing Loud, Sing Proud.\\" The bagpipes go along to the punk rock riffs on several songs, more so than any of their previous albums. Spider Stacy from The Pogues also sings with the band on \\"Flannigan's Ball.\\" \\"Famous For Nothing\\" makes for a great introduction to this album that is full of plenty of feel good anthems about the working class, the troubled times in politics, and even some of the old depressing traditional Irish songs they covered sound upbeat, or have plenty of emotion behind them.<br /><br />Cons: This band has lost some of their punk rock credibility since Mike McColgan left the band to pursue his own interest of becoming a Boston city firefighter (he recently returned to music with his new band, The Street Dogs), and they have received a large amount of criticism from even the devout fans that continue to pack concert halls to see them. This album is guaranteed not to sit well with their fan base, although it will generate a new fan base for them since their growth in popularity after \\"The Departed\\" soundtrack. The band also abandons several of the oi! influence that have been featured on previous albums.have been featured on previous albums.

0525457585|5.0|Having grown up loving the movie, I had to read the book as an adult.  I love the movie just the way it is, but knowing when it was made (without CG, special effests, etc..) I knew lots of really cool stuff had probably been left out.       The book is actually both movies (1&2) so that was cool since I have only seen the second one a couple of times.  (We all know is stinks compared to the first one.  Of course gotta love J.B - RIP)     I wouldn't mind seeing a few of these left out parts in a new version of the movie, like the desert and lion part.      I only wish this one had the Orin on the cover like in the movie, that would be sweet. Also, I thought it was cool that the book is printed in  two different color inks, one for the world of Fantasia, and one for bastians' world.  Neat!

B00005JPS9|5.0|BEOWULF isn't exactly subtle. In the annals of barbaric Sword & Sorcery, subtlety doesn't much enter into the picture.  BEOWULF is over-the-top, gruesome, and violent. And that's just the way we like our Beowulf. The story, written by Neil Gaiman and Roger Avary and adapted from the ancient, anonymous epic poem, begins in 507A.D. as a kingdom in Denmark is beset by the giant demon Grendel. Hrothgar (Anthony Hopkins), the beleaguered old monarch, sends out the word far and wide, calling for a hero to vanquish Grendel. Then comes Beowulf of Geatland (Sweden), brawny, fearless, and indomitable, who, in the midst of his swaggering and name boasting, manages to slay the demon. So, it seems, the curse is lifted and it's all good and gravy in the land of the Danes. But no one knew about Grendel's vengeful mother...or, as Beowulf vehemently asks: \\"Must I hack down a whole family tree of demons?!\\" Well, yes.<br /><br />As a guy, it's hard not to like this flick. It's action packed, with monsters and beautiful women and lots of testosterone-generating activity. And it's all animated. With today's sophisticated technology and the bar being constantly raised, we've all come to expect a certain standard of quality. Yet, even as jaded as I am, there's no denying that the animation in BEOWULF is worth marveling at. It's a mindboggling, painstaking work of cinema, and it does right with this oldest of adventure stories.<br /><br />Robert Zemeckis, who brought us the fabulous-looking but soulless Christmas fable [[ASIN:B000AGTPUK The Polar Express (Widescreen Edition)]], brings the same dazzling CGI animation to BEOWULF. In fact, his \\"performance capture\\" technology - which is basically a live action performance that's been digitally captured and enchanced by CGI - is even more realistic now and, in BEOWULF, wonderfully evokes a sense of grandeur and myth and a feel for time and place. I don't know too much about the process, but, man, do I like it. And this technique is simply perfect for this sort of larger-than-life storytelling as Grendel, his monstrous but seductive mother, and other mythical creatures are brought to vivid life. Oh, there are still moments when we're reminded that this technology still hasn't been perfected, as the camera catches a character engaged in a weird facial expression (for some reason, Queen Wealthow has a lot of these) or in the middle of some awkward movement. But these are infrequent moments. Instead, a lot of the scenes are simply breathtaking.<br /><br />On a side note, it shouldn't be a surprise that the story of Beowulf, with its grand, melodramatic themes, has even carved its way into the world of opera. The film mines several of these elements: power, in the vigor of youth and in the weight of the crown; ambition and temptation; loss and tragedy, redemption and regret. Love's in there, too, somewhere. So, in the midst of the carnage and chest-thumping, there are actually moments of introspection.<br /><br />As the bold and bombastic hero, Ray Winstone brings it - the commanding presence, the cool confidence, the fire. In real life a doughy 5'10\\" fella, Ray would've found it very challenging to physically play the warrior's warrior. But, thanks to \\"performance capture\\" we get to enjoy watching a mighty-thewed 6'6\\" Beowulf and have Ray's amazing voice and acting talent shine thru. Initially, I did feel that Beowulf was being depicted as too much a one-note character, all glory, no depth. But his character did begin showing layers following his confrontation with Grendel's mother in the cave.<br /><br />With a larger than life lead character, it's sometimes iffy for the supporting actors to make their mark. But veteran big time actors Anthony Hopkins and John Malkovich do add texture to the film, while Robin Wright-Penn, whom I haven't seen in a while, turns in a surprisingly good performance as Queen Wealthow. Crispin Glover adds depth to Grendel, a tortured soul, and even makes you feel sorry for the monster, even if you can't really  understand what the hell he's saying (apparently, it's in Old English). Angelina Jolie steals the show as Grendel's mother, who just 2 seconds ago shoved Jessica Rabbit and COOL WORLD's Holli Would off their perches as the hottest animated girls. I happen to find her accent very alluring.<br /><br />Ultimately, BEOWULF is a truimph in sweeping spectacle with just a touch of character study, and that's as it should be. This film is brutal and rowdy and visually compelling and will appeal to the barbarian at heart. This is Beowulf slaying monsters and downing mead, not Beowulf doing the crossword and sipping tea. Before Conan, before John Carter of Mars or Elric of Melnibone, before the Lord of the Rings, Beowulf made his mark. Now I'm not saying he inspired Conan and company, but Beowulf's story has been around for a thousand years and has been rooted in our public consciousness for so long that, well, you know what, maybe he did.ster, even if you can't really  understand what the hell he's saying (apparently, it's in Old English).

B000MV8AE0|4.0|Ed Harris did a wonderful job portraying the character of Beethoven.  I found the story line to be accurate as much as we know about the man today.  It made him very real to me, as a spiritual being - an artist creating with sound, and his love of the effect of sound.  The movie was interesting and inspiring, all the way through.<br /><br />Though it was not thought provoking, the movie had a deeper spiritual aspect that cleared up misconceptions I had about Beethoven, allowing me to enjoy Beethoven's works with enriched understanding of the man himself.
B000Q79HS8|4.0|If you liked the first two movies in this trilogy, you're probably going to like this one. Plenty of action, jumping in front of trains, etc. Even the cover looks like the previous movie.
0375831002|5.0|I bought this book with the intent of giving it to my 13 year old sister as a Christmas present. However, she has a rule that I have to read the book before I give it to her, to ensure she'll enjoy it. (Vampire novel didn't go over so well last time.)<br /><br />She'll like it.<br /><br />Zusak weaves a wonderful tale of a small orphan girl growing up in the heart of the Fatherland. Narrated from the point of view of Death, his writing style is unpredictable and engaging. The characters are painted beautifully, and the end of the book was the first to make me cry since Sirius died in HP5.<br /><br />I wholeheartedly recommend this book for anyone, girl or boy, from 12 on up to adult. (I'm a 19 year old college student). 5 stars.
B000YKFJ66|2.0|Pretty boring. The main character can see two minutes into the future, which is apparently farther than the screenwriter could. Cheesy special effects.

Well worth the read, if you have interest in spirituality and/or other parts of the world.
B000GRUMPU|4.0|This remake from 2006 stars Kurt Russell and Richard Dreyfuss. You've got an elegant cruise liner, a diverse cast of characters, and suddenly a rogue wave tips the whole thing over. Most of the survivors huddle in the main dining room - but a small group of passengers decide to make it out on their own.<br /><br />It's hard to judge this film just as a \\"stand alone disaster flick\\" since the 1972 version was so spectacular. It's sort of like if you really loved the Titanic with Leonardo - and then watched an action-adventure movie made now, that was half as long and truncated the characters. It would be really hard not to compare the two. So there are probably two types of watchers for this movie. One will be the people who saw the 1972 version and who are probably disappointed with this one as a result. On the other hand, people who watch this movie without any expectations, and just want a \\"wild ride for 1 1/2 hours\\" will find the special effects quite thrilling.<br /><br />Part of what this story is about is how a wide variety of characters - young boy, just-engaged couple, stowaway, older homosexual, etc. - manage to get over their issues and bond and get through troubles. Again if you're just looking for a \\"wild ride\\" won't care that these people are very stereotypical and cardboard cutout types. If you're actually a fan of drama movies where the characters grow and learn and reach into their inner strengths, you'll find this a poor version of that earlier film.<br /><br />On the other hand, part of any disaster movie is the excitement and reality of the disaster. A lava disaster movie seems hokey when they are running from \\"red water\\". When the lava is roiling, the heat waves are filling the screen and the smoke is thick, suddenly you can feel the panic and the danger. That is why we watch disaster movies - to watch people face dangers, and their fears, and hopefully rise above them. It gives us hope and encouragement that we might do the same.<br /><br />So while the 1972 version of Poseidon had some rather silly scenes of water and flood, this 2006 version does a GREAT job with many of the scenes. The way the water bursts through the windows, the way the ship is affected as it tilts upside down, it all feels very real. After the footage and experience of the Tsunami, it definitely feels real and scary to have a gigantic wave of water coming at you with nowhere to run to. You can also understand the panic of being in a submerged vessel that is sinking.<br /><br />There are numerous plot holes and factual errors, that if you're even half paying attention, make you lose your suspension of disbelief. I suppose it's that way with many disaster films - you have to just accept that they did things A and B even though doing C makes MUCH more sense to any sane person. Also, you would have thought that people working on a high budget film involving a ship would have made sure that all their basic research about how a ship works, how the ballast works, how the propeller works, etc. was correct.<br /><br />Still, in the end, you probably watch this film because it's a fun way to pass an hour and a half with your popcorn and soda. So in that sense, the movie suits that purpose, and is well worth a watch.ile the 1972 version of Poseidon had some rather silly scenes of water and flood, this 2006 version does a GREAT job with many of the scenes.

B000VBJEFK|4.0|i caught this film over the weekend and enjoyed the creativity and overall storyline and concepts. the pacing and adventures in the kitchen and all the things going just added so much to this film which will hold your interest from start to finish. it was a rags to riches and reality based film that will make you pay attention to details and everything else in between.very good and charming film.
B00000FCBC|4.0|This is a pretty damn good album.  I like many of the covers here, and this album is actually better than the misguided St. Anger.  Metallica's cover of Turn the Page is very well done and powerful, almost on par with Seger's original.  I like the choice of Sabra Cadabra, an obscure Sabbath track off their Sabbath, Bloody Sabbath album.  Their version of Tuesday's Gone (a cover of a Lynyrd Skynyrd song) reminds me of their beautiful (and unjustly trashed) songs Mama Said and Low Man's Lyric.  Hetfield does burp before the song starts (bad), but luckily, the rest of it is so good that you forget about this.  The inclusion of Garage Days, Revisited EP is a nice bonus, and having copies of Am I Evil? and So What? are great too.  And thanks to Metallica, I went out and bought Overkill by Motorhead.<br /><br />I'm not really sure why Metallica did a cover album (and a 2 CD set too), but I like it and think it's a worthy addition to their catalogue.

061891868X|5.0|Lee Smolin has written an excellent overview of the current state of science and especially, string theory. As a layman I found his earlier chapters more valuable, as he describes in clear and easy to understand language, the history of science up to the discovery of string theory. The later chapters deal with the lack of progress in theoretical physics since the mid 1980's, and the reasons for it.<br />Smolin is an excellent writer and the book is easy to read. There is so much material in the book that I intend to read it a second time.
B00003CXTG|1.0|Pearl Harbor is fantastic entertainment - fun, lively, it's an escape worthy of the hassle of popping a bunch of popcorn and setting up the home entertainment \\"just right\\" for two hours of mental candy.    But they should have named it something else.  I watched this in the theater and felt like standing up and waving in front of the screen - \\"NO! NO!  That's not right!  It wasn't like that!\\"    If filmmakers want to be inspired by history to produce schmaltz and cheese, fine - just don't name it after an actual event in an attempt to legitimize it.    The combat scenes defy physics, the portrayal of historical figures is overwhelming (Jon Voight's portrayal of FDR would have been made complete had he stood up, broke out of his clothes like the Incredible Hulk and shot death rays from his fists) and the history, suspect.  For one, I am reasonably confident WWII battles weren't broadcast \\"live\\" over radio.    Though it's nowhere near the Golly! Wow! Bang! Whiz! of Pearl Harbor, Tora Tora Tora is five times the film - accurate, balanced and passionate.  Buy that.  Leave Pearl Harbor for the people who stand in line at \\"Dukes of Hazard\\" conventions to get their photos taken next to a genuine plaster cast of the General Lee's tire. (YoooHOO!)    I'd have liked Pearl Harbor more if they would have added a giant laser-blasting sea beast or maybe brain-headed aliens....and then named it, \\"The Giant Sea Beast From World War Two.\\"
0684803356|5.0|Ernest Hemingway wrote another great adventure story with FOR WHOM THE BELL TOLLS. His style is very vivid, and reading the book is like being on the scene of the Spanish Civil War itself. Prior to reading FOR WHOM THE BELL TOLLS, I had read all his short stories while taking a short story course in college, then THE OLD MAN AND THE SEA. The short stories vary in style, except that they are also written in short sentences, just as Hemingway preferred. THE OLD MAN AND THE SEA tends to be boring, but FOR WHOM THE BELL TOLLS is fascinating throughout. I just wish I had the time to read more of Hemingway's novels, just to see what they are like.
B00003CX5P|1.0|I remember when this film came out, I kept putting off seeing it.  And putting it off, and off.  Then it came out on video, and I finally rented it.  I think I was putting it off because I instinctively knew it was going to be awful, and I was right.  It is one of the dullest, most atrociously acted films I've ever seen.  The acting was stody and boring, and considering the acting talent involved (Liam Neeson, Ewan McGregor, and Samuel L. Jackson), you'd think Lucas could have done something spectacular with them.  Alas, no.  Lucas has said numerous times that he detests directing (this was the first film he's directed in over 20 years since the original Star Wars film), and his contempt for directing shows.  It feels like a sonambulistic exercise, intent on putting us to sleep, and it has an overall lackadasical feel that really irks the viewer.  Many who saw this were extremely disappointed because they loved the originals so much (the original 3 are far superior than this tripe).  They more than likely felt a sense of obligation and loyalty to see this film and the progressively worse prequels.  They grew up with the original Star Wars films, and they went away disappointed and angry at the fact the prequels were inferior in every way to the originals...<br /><br />Lucas's dialogue is wretched, his pacing is totally off, and he seems to be killing time here.  There's no real enthusiasm here, in front of the camera or in back of it.  Perhaps the actors picked up on the fact that Lucas didn't give a damn about his own film, so why should they?  I sometimes think Lucas purposely made bad prequels so he wouldn't have to film the final 3 chapters.  And why did he decide to make the prequels?  If he made the 3 films that were supposed to take place after Return of the Jedi, he would have had no real creative restraints.  Who knows why George Lucas does what he does?  I haven't a clue, other than I really disliked this film.

0307346617|5.0|I'm not a zombie guy--no interest in them whatsoever.  I've watched the zombie craze in pop culture, observing from afar, and simply didn't get it.  So when a hardcover came out a while back featuring a storyline about zombies overrunning the world, I quickly dismissed it.<br /><br />Last week, my friend told me about an incredible book called World War Z.  I said, \\"Isn't that a zombie book?\\"  He said yes, but then quickly fought to overcome my bias with reasons why I would love it.<br /><br />It worked.<br /><br />After just mere minutes of describing the book, he had me soundly invested.  I got my own copy the next day and had World War Z finished inside of a week (remember I work full time and write on the side, so a book in a week is pretty fast for me).<br /><br />World War Z completely won me over because it was written as though it belonged to the nonfiction genre.  The author presents a narrator who conducts a series of interviews years after a pandemic global outbreak of a zombie virus that nearly drove humanity into extinction.  The interviews are typically only a few pages long and focus on military leaders, doctors, scientist, and regular citizens literally from all over the world.  The reader then has the pleasure of piecing all these interviews together in order to get a broader sense of an epic story.<br /><br />The sheer imagination of the author, Max Brooks, is staggering.  He truly considered every possibility with World War Z.  The ideas he presented as fact were absolutely plausible, and at times you forget you're reading fiction.  I caught myself thinking, \\"Okay, what would I do if I were in this situation?\\"<br /><br />Furthermore, the zombies were almost secondary in the book.  Brooks focused more on the human reaction to possible extinction, and the power of fear that can overcome us all.  But he also emphasized the human will to survive, and the motivation to triumph in any sort of adversity.  And while I wouldn't call this a political book, I believe Brooks made a few statements about our current geopolitical climate if you read between the lines.<br /><br />It's not all roses, though.  I loved the book, and I literally could not put it down, but I must admit it was probably about fifty pages too long.  Near the end, things started getting a little repetitive.  Not enough to quail my enthusiasm for World War Z, but it could have stood a little trimming up.<br /><br />To sum up, Brooks' imagination and style have won him a loyal reader.  Remember, I've been telling everyone I know to read this book about zombies, and I hate zombies!<br /><br />~Scott William Foley, author of [[ASIN:0595360823 Souls Triumphant]]current geopolitical climate if you read between the lines.

B0002A2WDQ|5.0|Eugene \\"Lightning Boy\\" Martone (Macchio) is a classical music prodigy, an early admission to Julliard, who's fascinated with the blues.  Research tells him he's found Willie Brown/Blind Dog Fulton (Joe Seneca) who was one of Robert Johnson's last companions--who may well know Johnson's missing 30th song.     If he thinks he can just ask for that song, Eugene's got it wrong.  Willie Brown wants him to break him out of the hospital he's been incarcerated in and take him to Mississippi.  Once he's there and got his business done, Brown will teach him that song.     Eugene learns first-hand just what a bluesman's life is like.  Eugene's money won't take them any further than Memphis, so they have to hitch the rest of the way.  On the road, they meet Francis, (Jami Gertz) a 15 year old who's running away from an abusive stepfather and is going to get a dance gig in LA.      On the way, the trio run into everything from crooked cops to a prostitution peddler. They earn their way to Mississippi busking.     What Eugene gets to deal with is poverty, cold, love, abandonment....all the things that give birth to the blues.      \\"Crossroads\\" is a great piece of Southern fiction based on a long-told story.  The film's just in general well done and the scoring is par excellence. Ry Cooder really does know the blues.
0451205766|5.0|Think you know alot about the Corleone crime family from watching 'The Godfather' trilogy over and over again...? Hey, take it from me --- FUGGEDABOUTIT! This great book by Mario Puzo takes you inside \\"the family\\" in ways the movies couldn't. The characters of Don Vito Corleone and his sons Sonny, Fredo and Michael (among many others) are brought vividly to 3-Dimensional life here. The plot twists and turns through the ups and downs of their mafia life of crime are expertly handled. There isn't a single wasted page in the 440+. From the first page on, the reader knows they are in the hands of a master storyteller and it truly is one of those books that's really hard to put down. And when it ends, you really don't want it to. This is one of those remarkably rare books that was the fountainhead for countless films, tv shows and books that were inspired by it. It's like the characters, themes and settings have all literally taken on a life of their own! Guys like Tony Soprano would never have existed if it hadn't been for 'The Godfather'. Filled with great food, sex and violence it's no surprise why this book has been one of the best selling in all of publishing history over the years since it first came out back in 1969!

B000U1ZV8K|3.0|As cool an idea as this 4 Film Favorites line of DVDs is, this Lethal Weapon one probably feels like a slap in the face to those who spent a large amount of money buying the box set from Amazon, etc (or, in my case, from a seperate seller who wasn't specific about what he was selling). Sure, some people aren't fond of flipper discs or even directors cuts, but if your money conscience enough not to care about those things (some of the original Lethal Weapon DVDs were double sided as well), this under $20 two disc set is probably a good choice. I just wish they had come out with this sooner.
B00070DK5K|5.0|Yes, Bowie looks ill and deathly thin on the cover.  Yes, he probably was not in the best of shape when this record was recorded.  I don't care.  Maybe that's what makes his performance so phenomenal........maybe the music was all he had at this time in his life, and he was clinging to it desperately.  This is one of the greatest rock live records ever recorded!!  Buy it!!  You'll be knocked back by the incredible performances by the sterling band.  Mike Garson (piano, mellotron) and a two piece horn section featuring David Sanborn (alto sax, flute) and Richard Grando (baritone sax, flute) point the way to a very jazzy sound throughout.  Earl Slick (guitar) throws a fiery edged rock touch into the mix.  Add lots of percussion, a second keyboard player, and a couple of great background vocalists, and you have a band which would be hard to match anywhere.  Bowie draws on a variety of his early 70's material, but the record is dominated by selections from Aladdin Sane and Diamond Dogs.  I actually prefer the performances here to ones on those two studio records because of the spontaneity of these great musicians in a live setting.  Bowie gives urgent vocal performances on some of his most passionate tunes such as Rock 'n' Roll With Me and Big Brother.  The band, particularly Slick, prove they can rock hard whenever they want on Cracked Actor and Width of A Circle.  All in all, just a tremendous and most essential record if you really want to experience live Bowie at his best.

This book mostly focuses on e-commerce sites but it still has some good tips that may apply to any website.    This book doesn't teach you HTML or any programing it is strictly usability.

B000VLOKQI|4.0|As a long-time Who fan, I had high expectations for this documentary, but it doesn't hold much of a candle to 'The Kids Are Alright'.  'Amazing Journey' I found to be somber, but fitting and overdue tribute to Keith Moon and John Entwistle. I was very disappointed that this documentary wasn't fun and wild like 'The Kids Are Alright' and that the rare concert clips were very short! There wasn't anything covered in this documentary that I didn't already know, but the concert clips were great! Since the 1970 'Live At Leeds' was recently discovered on film, I am hoping that Daltrey and Townshend will release that and the return to Leeds concert that happended a couple of years ago.  For fans who are just discovering the band, see 'The Kids Are Alright' first.
B00006GA4C|4.0|Some may say this, GF's second record, is a musically simplistic piece of work.  But no one ever listened to Grand Funk for complexity.  For a raw, burning power trio sound, this record is hard to beat.  Lots of fun, funky rock 'n' roll and lots of sex in the first four tunes.  The record gets heavier after that, including the longer concert staples In Need and Inside Looking Out, Mark Farner's climactic hard edged guitar playing on display.  Only one throw-away tune:  I just never cared for Paranoid.  If you're looking for depth and complex musical layers, buy some Pink Floyd or Deep Purple.  If you're looking to party and nothing else, put on this record.
B00000DOYR|5.0|Let there be rock indeed. This album can be hard to review in isolation given the circumstances the band were in. But let's try to give it an unbiased spin shall we?<br /><br />Released in 1980 at the height of the NWOBHM and produced by Mutt Lange who did a scorching knob job this album with it's plain statement of intent right down to it's simple black cover and stark white lettering for band logo and title did the business in a seriously no fuss way. On this album AC/DC perhaps for the first and maybe last time put out an album that was not only consistent in terms of musical style but also very trimmed of fat. Boogie metal gone seriously acidic in an almost gleeful defiance.<br /><br />On this album AC/DC seem to have distilled their combined experiences and created a stronger, more pure version of their riff driven brand of head banging hard rock. The use of studio tricks on numbers such as Hells Bells carries over from the similar use of such trickery on earlier albums but here it seems a touch more mature and atmospheric. Really the only earlier DC album that can really be considered in the same ballpark is Highway to Hell. And given that was the previous album it really does back up the theory that at this point the band were able to translate all the skills and flair learned on the hard touring circuits of Australia and the UK and channel them into a purity of mission. The rhythm section is tight as, well it's as tight as anything you'd care to mention. Angus and Malcolm as usual are excellent riff masters and Brian Johnson has a voice that suits this music perfectly.<br /><br />It all adds up to one of the most famous and biggest selling hard rock/heavy metal albums ever and it's easy to see why it was so successful given the heads down work ethic of the band, rocking with and never above the punters who paid for the albums in the first place.<br /><br />Heartily recommended for parties, highway cruising, invading foreign nations or robbing banks. Preferably all at once.
B000Y7U98C|3.0|The movie opens up with enough potential, and with a pretty interesting idea: the sun is dying, and the crew essentially need to restart it. The initial crew that went out to attempt to do the same thing, Icarus I, mysteriously disappeared. Of course, the crew of Icarus II hear the distress call that was masked by the gravity of Venus, and decide to alter their course to use the payload to double their chances of recharging the sun.    So far so good. At this point, the movie is moving at a brisk pace. with a surprisingly good performance by Chris Evans who places the mission above all things. Also, the movie portrays what life on a ship must be like, especially for one of this length: the ship has an on board psychologist, an 'Earth Room\\" to de-stress oneself, a replenishing oxygen/fauna room, ect ect. The point where the Icuras II comes into contact with Icuras I is where the movie falls apart.    Of course, following the conventions of the thriller, something goes wrong. And the tension is HIGH, Danny Boyle does a fantastic job of conveying the urgency of getting back to the Icurus II. After a miraculous jump through space, the crew comes back, but unknowingly, with an extra passenger. Who do you think sabotaged the linking of the ships in the first place?    After this, rather than go on a philosophical angle like \\"Solaris\\", it takes notes from \\"Event Horizon\\", the movie reduces itself to a slasher/horror movie. Thats right, the single living crew member of the Icurus I is still alive, still able to speak, still able to run around not only normally, but superhumanly, and is pretty damn strong, goes around the Icurus II, because he's had conversations with God. An interesting idea that is ultimately executed terribly. The script could have used another revision or two or three to rework this entire act and the motivation of the stowaway.    Over all, the movie is in a pretty wrapper, but nothing much else. It is beautifully filmed, great acting, Boyle's directingis up to par, as per usual, but over all, a major disappointment.
B000LC4CVA|5.0|This dvd is one of my newest but already  it has earned its place as my favorite, one I will never let go. My husband and I saw parts of it months ago on the PBS special. We liked it and looked around found it on Amizon. For some reason or another we couldn't buy it right then. Flash forward many months. My husband has been diagnosed with Lou Gehrig's Disease. We have been hospitalized for several months, several hours away from home and friends. (Well, he has, but I stayed there with him the whole time.) One day in October,I was puttering around on the computer and I came across the link I had saved for this dvd, and I ordered it. By the time it came and I drove home to get it it was almost Halloween. When I brought it to his room, he insisted that we watch it immediately. By this point in his disease proccess he was unable to stay awake for very long, unable to stay focused very long. He was scared, because he knew his body was dying around his brilliant, beautiful mind. From the moment this dvd started, the first strains of music, the first girls began to sing, he was captivated. He did not drift off or waver away from the performance even once. These women have such gifts, but I am sure they don't know what a gift they shared with my husband and I that night, and for several nights to follow. For just a few hours, we were not in a hospital, we were not battling a terminal illness, we were just us again.  Music, theatre and performing had been my husbands whole life, and this concert was able to take him back to that place. We watched and listened to the dvd many times over the next week and a half. On Sunday evening, November 11, he was tense, tremoring, wouldn't wake up, but couldn't seem to rest either. I put in the dvd of Celtic Woman. From the first notes of the music he visably began to relax. While all of the ladies were singing You Raise Me Up, though I thought him to be asleep or unconscious, a tear rolled down his cheek. I let the concert play at a lowvolume the rest of the night and the next day. He remained calm and peaceful throughout. At about 4:45pm,November 12, my husband laid down his arms and stopped fighting, went quietly with death as if it were an old friend come to lead him home. He will always be a part of me, and I will always be greatful to Celtic Woman for making his last days peaceful ones.     Ok, as for a critical review, the music is breathtaking. The women all sing beautifully, each bringing their own unique sound to the table.  Mairead is one of the most talented fiddle performers I have yet to see. And you will note that I say fiddle performer, not fiddle player, because she does not mearly play, she truly performs, flying across the stage and all about dancing and jumping while never missing a note as she is playing. The show is visually pleasing, stimulating yet soothing. The set is well thought out, suitably showcases the ladies, but also the many parts of the band and the choir. The use of so  many cameras and great angles make you feel as if you are really there, and assures that each person involved gets their moment on film.  I give it 5 stars! It is deserving of more, but that is all that is available on the Amazon reviews! BRAVO!!!
B000WQ9UA8|4.0|Britney has done it again.  Love it!  My favs are Piece of Me, Radar, and Toy Soldier.
B000002JQ6|4.0|AC/DC are one of those bands that bring out the wastrel in all their listeners, continually making pretty much the same record time and time again in brilliant fashion - in fact when their career has stumbled it's usually because they tried something a tiny bit different. So it makes sense that a double live CD of this band in full flight is going to stick to the tried and true formula of intellect negating good time heavy rock. And does it ever.<br /><br />Blasting off with Thunderstruck with huge sound and production values the first CD barrels down the highway to brain cell oblivion in fine style, rendering resistance futile with wave after wave of top notch, blues based boogie metal. Songs like Shoot to Thrill, Back in Black, Who Made Who and Heatseeker - it doesn't matter a devil of a lot what part of the bands career they pick `em from, just about every AC/DC platter has something tasty to feed the adoring hordes that can be heard screaming their lungs out in the background as the Young brothers with Cliff Williams and Chris Slade in the engine room (bass and drums respectively) and Geordie belter Brian Johnson out front as ringmaster lay waste to the punters in the nicest possible way.<br /><br />As the collection rolls ever onward it becomes apparent that no, there will be no let up, the toe tappin' and head bangin' collection of boogie metal will never stop until there are no more doubters in the arena, all attendees either having long since started bopping along with the bands ever reliable muse or otherwise having fled the building. Disc two - oh just look at some of the wattage on the thing - Hells Bells, High Voltage, You Shook Me All Night Long, Whole Lotta Rosie, Let There Be Rock, Highway to Hell, T.N.T and For Those About to Rock. I mean there are more bona fide metal massacre stompers on the second disc of this release than most bands write in a career.<br /><br />You may have read between the lines of this review that in some ways I'm not a fan. And you'd be right. The inability to reach out/branch out. The revelling in underachieving low brow culture, the utter denial of anything to aspire to apart from the next drink or bonk. But it's simply undeniable that the world of heavy rock and metal needs at least a few bands like AC/DC to shake things down to a simple brew, a hedonistic explosion of throwaway good times for the sake of it. And this double disc version of the Australian/Scottish (whatever they're claiming to be this week) bands greatest cuts performed raw, live and sweaty is a testament to how a simple plan will work wonders as long as it's a good plan. And this is a band that is seriously brilliant at what they do as this fine collection attests.nability to reach out/branch out.

B00004HYLF|5.0|I had forgotten just how good this recording was. I purchased the original album back in the 70's when it came out. The music still sounds good, as good music usually stands the test of time. If you have never heard this recording you are in for a treat.
B000UOOT1W|2.0|I have been listening to Santana for over 30 years and this is nothing new.  To re-hash the same music and sell it is an embarassment to the great musician that Carlos Santana is.  If I want to hear old/greatest hits of Santana, I will get out my old records/CD's.
B0000DJZB9|3.0|A straight run through of 13 Gunners video clips in chronological order.<br /><br />No booklet (which is usual for DVD's). Not even internal cover art.<br /><br />No extras. No interview footage. No insight into the creative process.<br /><br />If you don't like the style of the first part of this review you may not like the idea of this release. Or the lack of one. What annoys me is that it would of been good to have had something other than the songs to entertain the viewer with. That might of been a nice idea. Or they could of made this a double disc and transferred the Makin' videos series onto DVD to add value. It probably would of been a nice idea. They could of used some of the millions they've earned off the buying public to put some extra value into this release with at least a booklet or something. Or some behind the scenes footage from the making of some of these videos. Now THAT would of been a really nice idea.<br /><br />I wholeheartedly recommend buying this DVD for the sheer brilliance of the enclosed hard rock/heavy metal music. You simply can't go past the visceral Welcome to the Jungle, the simply brilliant Sweet Child O' Mine or the genius of concept with November Rain. You can't but nod your head in appreciation of a band that was swimming in money still coming out with videos like The Garden or Dead Horse or having the intestinal fortitude to try something like Estranged.<br /><br />My issue is not with the music, but the lacklustre packaging and almost arrogance of the powers that be that we'll buy this no matter what. And you know what grates? That they are right. This is really great music and some great video making with ideas and soul. It's a pity this package didn't have some. Actually, don't buy it. Download it.

B00001NFCY|4.0|Creeds breakthrough album comes armed with a number of slants on the bands staunchly hard rock musical outlook. With meaty guitar sounds the album is firmly a hard rock affair though with less moments bordering on metal than the My Own Prison album. Scott Stapp seems to have become better at putting feeling into his vocal performance and the timbre of his voice is still impressive. Of course with all vocalists he won't suit all tastes but his smooth mid range delivery definitely suits the full blooded rock that it's backed up with.<br /><br />The album changes gears from heavier to lighter shades of Creeds post grunge hard rock, I suppose Nickeback were their main competition, very few other bands having much success in breaking into the mainstream in the name of rock with the exception of teen friendly pop-punkers during much of Creeds existence. And that is another thing that probably worked in their favour, the honest and at times quite gritty guitar riffs and melodies being a welcome change from the endless procession of teen starlets we were forced to suffer during the early 00's.<br /><br />As for my favourite songs? Well With Arms Wide Open is a quality song where Stapps voice is front and centre and the band take a back seat and Higher is an excellent full bodied rock `n' roll song. In addition I'd have to give a special mention to Beautiful which has a good short sharp riff that clips along when unleashed while the lyrics are actually a bit of a downer. But in a good way, the band touching on the subject of youthful disillusion with wanting something it's perhaps better not to get. And the problems that can happen if you don't keep it in perspective.<br /><br />Overall this is an album that hangs together as a collection of songs, something Creed had a knack for right from the word go, everything sounds like it belongs here even if not all the songs are pistol packin' desperados. The production is good - I mean it'd wanna be since this is an album from '99 right? And as for the much discussed religious overtones they are there, but as per their next album the lyrics are usually vague enough that even those not from the bible belt USA can enjoy this album and take something from the lyrics. And that DOES denote talent, regardless of what the backlash merchants might have you believe.<br /><br />For the fan, well your only reading this for your own amusement - I mean you already own this and just wanted to see the opinions of others right? As for the casual fan who is thinking of buying this you'd be better served to get their greatest hits collection initially released in 2004 and then decide on whether to pick up the back catalogue.ch discussed religious overtones they are there, but as per their next album the lyrics are usually vague enough that even those not from the bible belt USA can enjoy this album and take something from the lyrics.

B000I9YLUI|5.0|I loved the book Pride and Prejudice and this movie follows the book beautifully, it flows great, and Kiera Knightly is such a belivable rendition of the character in the book. Mathew Mcfayden also is good as Mr. Darcy, could be a little better, but works wonderfully with Kiera Knightly. The movie definitly does justice to the book.
B00005JPS9|4.0|The movie was pretty good, but the Digital 3-D makes Beowulf a must see. My local theater has the digital screens, so I didn't have to go to the IMAX. I had to pay $2.00 more for the glasses, but it was worth every penny. The visuals are stunning to say the least. Everything just pops out crystal clear. Without the 3-D I would have rather waited to catch it on High Def DVD, but it's really more of an event than a movie.
B000002IH5|5.0|The bulk of the Tracks here included Previously Released Singles, B-Sides, And a handful of of Unreleased Gems from the vaults. This well put together collection finds Otis in various settings. Album includes the #1 Billboard Gold R&B/Pop Hit Single \\"The Dock Of The Bay\\", Plus Hit Singles: \\"Tramp\\" (With Carla Thomas) which was a Billboard #2 Hit in 1967, \\"The Glory Of Love\\" a Billboard Top 20 Hit also in '67!, and \\"I Love You More Than Words Can Say\\" a Billboard Top 40 Hit Single also from '67 . Included is the Album Favorite \\"Open The Door\\" that could have/should have been released as a Single to boost album, but the good folks at Atlantic was going through the vaults for future Otis Redding releases and was moving fast!, so there was no further Singles released from this album. There are a couple of \\"Best Of\\" Collections, a Box Set, but if you're seeking out getting ALL of Otis Redding's Albums (Compact Discs)...This IS a Must Have.
B000002JS8|5.0|This album manages one of my rare five star gradings due to a range of issues. Firstly is it's purity of mission. There is nothing but self belief on this album and that's always a good start. There is no hint of compromise nor of doubt and the band has here achieved a purity of mission the like of which they only ever achieved again with such perfection on Back in Black.<br /><br />Secondly the tunes themselves are excellent. Numbskull boogie metal this may be with about the same level of adventurousness as Status Quo post about 70's but AC/DC have their auto pilot locked onto a far more testosterone fueled trajectory. From the opener Highway to Hell which is anti authoritarian and triumphant to the hot and heavy boogie of Girls Got Rhythm to over the top heavy rockers like Touch Too Much, the whole album hangs together beautifully. Not to mention the endless double entendre of which Bon, with his mischievous and evil vocal tones, bring to life with an evil glint the eye.<br /><br />Thirdly the album not only sounds right in terms of tunes, it sounds right in terms of production. Even my remastered edition is not in possession of the sort of super plush shag pile production you'd get in later times but a traditional knob job that allows the songs to breath and to rely on strength of riff without the overuse of bells and whistles of studio trickery to spark things up. Which adds to the feel of honesty and grit that always surrounded this bands early output, even where the songs weren't quite up to the task.<br /><br />With a strong sense of purpose and a frontman who'd grown in stature through relentless touring AC/DC here produced a quality party metal album, pure in form and unapologetic about it's lack of nuance. Everyone should own a couple of AC/DC albums for those times when you need something without frills and IMHO this and Back in Black are the best of the lot and perfect for people wanting to find out what all the fuss is about.
B000UGG39Q|5.0|About 10 years ago I came across the first down album and loved it, at the time Pantera was one of the best bands in the world while Down was something as a different approach to the singing style most weren't use to by Phil.    Alot has happened since then and as many know that old saying, \\"what doesn't kill you, makes you stronger\\", which in this case means more than ever.    There were lots of Pantera fans (even myself) that thought that it was because of Phil was one of the reasonings Dime whinded up where he is. RIP!!!    As time went on, I took a step back and realized that things just happen that is beyond anyones control. Hell no one knows what tomorrow will bring, you just got to live your life to the fullest and that prick who killed one of the greatest guitarists ever is burning for it...that is if you believe in religion, but that's not the point here.    Things may have been messed up at the time of the dismemberment of Pantera which led to some things I'm sure Phil regrets saying but you have to know when to keep your arms open for someone that was a big part of it. Vinnie has alot of hate for Phil but I don't care what anyone says, this is the time where whether he knows it or not to have Phil back into his life, the same with Rita. I know I am probably gonna to piss people off by saying that but I don't care because it's my opinion.    People need to know that bands break up and have lots of tension but in time, those people put things behind them and know they are better than that. No one knew Van Halen was going to come back but they did and I was at the last concert which rocked! So you just never know.    This is a different circumstance but if Dime was still around, you never know what could've happened. Hopefully in time, both Vinnie and Phil will realize that they both cared more than enough for Dime, putting their differences aside and know they don't have to have hate for one another, I think it's more on Vinnie but I don't know cause I don't live their life.    It's all about forgiving and if we don't some how find a way to do so, then we doom ourselves of not knowing just how much we are missing out.    If the song \\"Mourn\\" doesn't speak in volumes, I don't know what will.    That, amongst other things. The CD is great! The first time I heard some of the songs before the album came out, I wasn't sure if I'd get it, now it's funny cause those same ones I'm liking even more...or more than I did.    It's an album that grows on you. I liked the entire album at first listen but liked it even more the second time around. For anyone that keeps an open mind and doesn't shut it out because of of your own personal reasons of Phil, than this album is for you.
0316010669|3.0|I read this book as an extra credit assignment for my Social Psychology class.  As I was reading it, I did indeed find it to be well-written; the anecdotes were fascinating, and the basic overall idea about the value of intuition and \\"gut-feeling\\" sounded pretty interesting on paper.  But, after I finished, and I had time for the ideas to sink in a bit more, I began to question the value of what was presented.  I presented these concerns at the subsequent class discussion, and I'll present them again here.    To start the criticisms off on a light note, I can't help but point out a certain amusing irony I noticed all throughout my reading of Gladwell's books.  One of the fundamental ideas that Gladwell ends up presenting is that a lot of our information-deducing today is based off of information overload that gives too much attention to all sorts of potentially irrelevant details, at the expense of concentrating on a select few key factors.  Sounds fair enough, right?  Well, ironically enough, these ideas are often accompanied by very long-winded, hit-you-over-the-head-with-detail descriptions of the places he goes to and the people he meets in his examples/anecdotes (ex: \\"the JFCOM building is situated in such and such place, and appears to be a regular nondescript building, but inside houses...\\" or \\"he had a runner's build and a peculiar accent...\\").  As I was reading these, I found myself chuckling to myself and saying \\"Okay, yeah, that's interesting and well-written.  But didn't you just say that we shouldn't be drowning ourselves in details?\\"  Gladwell's a journalist by trade, so I guess it's to be expected that he writes so much, but it's still a little ironic, given the subject matter.    Moving on, there are greater concerns to be addressed, one of the paramount ones being how and when, exactly, the seemingly ground-breaking ideas Gladwell presents can be practically applied.  For example, the first couple of chapters discuss anecdotes where experts are ableto use their \\"gut feelings\\" to their advantage (ex: expert art historians identify a statue as a fake as soon as they first see it), and essentially uses these anecdotes as an attempt to show just how cool and unique these new ideas of \\"thin-slicing\\" information are.  However, he also goes on to show how snap judgments can be bad, such as in cases of racial prejudice.  So snap judgments can be good, but they can also be bad.  Okay, that's true enough.  But that begs the question: HOW can you tell when they're good or bad?  When the cops who shot Amadou Diallo ended up shooting an unarmed man who, at first glance and according to a select few details (someone standing around outside in the middle of the night in a rough NYC neighborhood), appeared to be a threat, how, exactly, was their snap judgment different or flawed?  How can you differentiate between good and bad snap judgments?  Unfortunately, Gladwell doesn't really elaborate on this, except to say in the prejudice chapter \\"don't let prejudices get to you\\" or \\"associate minorities with something positive in your mind,\\" which really isn't that big of a help.  A bit more elaboration would have been very useful.    The other main complaint has to do with Gladwell's reliance on experts and the successful judgments they make as examples of how intuition can be so helpful.  I once read Richard Posner's negative review of \\"Blink,\\" and one of the things he came up with that I found to be a good point was: \\"the contrast between intuitive and articulate thinking is overdrawn: it ignores the fact that deliberative procedures can become unconscious simply by becoming habitual, without thereby being intuitive in the sense of pre-verbal or emotional.\\"  In other words, experts are able to make such quick judgments because they have spent so many years making the same logical deductions over the years, that they eventually become second nature to them.    Gladwell does go on, in one part, to laud the value of expertise and experience in improving an individual's ability to make good judgments.  But that's just it: so many of the examples he gives deal with experts, people who have so much practical knowledge of their fields that they know how to do their jobs by heart.  Which begs another question: how does the layperson know what to do?  Most people aren't like the veteran police officer who knew not to shoot the teenage gang member, or like the food tasters who can specifically identify different aspects of taste.  How, then, is the average person supposed to take advantage of all of these ideas of intuition and quick judments, when (by Gladwell's own admission, no less!) experience, gained gradually over time, counts for so much in making them successful?    And finally, the key aspect that I found.  So much has been said about the \\"intuition vs. deliberate logic\\" debate that this book supposedly inspires.  And yet, when you think about it, do the examples Gladwell present really do much to promote \\"intuition\\" and fly in the face of cold hard logic?  I think not.  Consider, for example, the anecdote in the book about Lee Goldman's algorithm for detecting heart attacks, using only three or for symptoms.  Is this really an example of intuition?  Hardly.  Goldman found these factors through a long process of research and observation.  And applying these factors nevertheless still employs logical observation to detect these physical symptoms; the difference is, it's a more efficient form of observation that doesn't get bogged down in details.  It's the same thing with the Millenium Challenge and Marine Corps general/military strategist Paul Van Riper.  Did Van Riper defeat the behemoth opposing team in the war game using intuition?  No.  He employed commonsense, yet fundamentally logical, solutions.  When the opposing team had satellites to intercept military messages, Van Riper used bike couriers to deliver messages that weren't detected by the technology.  He used surprise attacks andblind-sides to work around the opposing team's bloated intelligence systems, and therefore scored a decisive victory.    And yet it seems like Gladwell is trying to pass these examples off as examples of the triumph of gut feelings.  In reality, I think that anecdotes like these do better to form a different conclusion: it is not logic that's the problem.  It's the KIND of logic that is often employed; that which gets bloated by irrelevant details.  Instead, Goldman and Van Riper's experiences seem to imply that what is needed is a more efficient form of logic, which uses common sense and remains focused on the key issues at hand, but which are nevertheless conscious and deliberate forms of reason.  I think that's what the case is largely made for via these examples.  For all I know, this could have been Gladwell's intention, but so much of the book is spent trying to sell the idea of \\"intuition\\" and \\"quick judgments\\" that this really isn't clear.    And that, fundamentally, is the book's major problem.  I think it's trying more to \\"sell\\" a seemingly ground-breaking idea of new ways to think smarter, not harder, rather than making sure that these arguments hold up under scrutiny.  Personally, a few simple, critical questions (\\"How can you tell when your instincts are right or wrong?\\" \\"How can the layperson do this?\\" \\"Is that really intuition, or is it still logic?\\") were enough for me to think, \\"huh.  It's interesting on paper, but I don't know if it's really right.\\"  Like I said in my title, it's kind of lacking in overall substance.  In the end, I suppose I would recommend that people borrow the book and see what they think from there, but I would at the same time advise them to approach it with a relatively quizzical eye, and not to accept everything at face value.
