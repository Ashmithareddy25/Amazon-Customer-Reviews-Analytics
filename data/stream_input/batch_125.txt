B000IYBERG|5|Change this on my 2001 Honda Accord EX 4dr, works fantastic, easy installation and fits perfectly! I can feel my car accelerates faster. I would also recommend buying the NGK spark plugs along so that you can change them all at once.
B0126A02AO|5|Nice beuty n my car fit perfect.ford escape 2004 great.
B00VB2OI2C|2|Nice durable cover but does not quite fit correctly on the 2013 Hyundai Veloster.  Should have ordered the next size up
B000TYORRE|4|did the job and fit great
B0088V424S|5|awesome decal
B00XBEJZA8|5|My fiance came home on his lunch break today and his new light bar came in the mail.He immediately hooked up to his battery in his truck and it works great! very heavy duty ! he is extremely happy with this product!
B00PJ3ACOW|5|Love it
B000C9ODLQ|1|Make noise
B001GG09GW|5|Awesome I love it
B00OYQA9WK|5|This is the whole light assembly.  It was easy to remove the old part and plug this right in. It fit perfectly and works just fine. The whole removal and installation took less than 15 minutes. We have a 2013 Pilot and the Honda dealership wanted $250 to replace this part.
B00B6X7PGM|5|Arrived quickly, works great!
B001UC72UI|5|Right product.
B0044A59JE|5|Works perfect on my 2006 Pontiac GTO.
B00267PXOS|4|I purchased this stool so that I can scoot around in my crawl space that has only 52&#34; head room.  Walking bent over is for someone much younger than I!  I can't say that I have given it the true test, but it seems like it will work perfectly.  Sturdy - easy to assemble.
B004C8L1AE|2|might not work with your vehicle.  Even though they claim the built-in resistor will allow them to work anywhere
B00937YVXI|5|Plugged right in awesome
B0046I3I8I|4|They fit our boat tires perfectly
B004BTRQHQ|5|Good product, have them on my car and every thing is good.
B00LBUAN46|5|for the price,i only use the pad once...it's to much hassle to clean & reuse
B00GHT6SF4|5|This fits perfectly and looks great! Highly recommend!
B00KB4ZI02|5|Excellent quality applies very easily
B0058VETJE|1|After going through hell and breaking most of the pieces that hold my bumper on and blowing 10 fuses to instal these correctly without instructions. the right fog light burnt out a week later. And these are certainly not OEM at all. you have to plug them directly onto the battery and splice the wire for the low beams.
B004P9DQLC|5|One of the best recovery straps on the market. Buy it.
B008R0ZXPC|5|Great fit for 6 foot and athletic/healthier frame. I have a long reach and wide shoulders so it is very hard to buy jackets that dont look short in the arms, this is a tad short but much better than all others I tried at a B&M. No miles yet, but out of the box I am very happy with the purchase.
B0034ZL3I6|4|Love the performance and look, chrome could be done a little better, overall a decent buy.
B00KX03VCQ|2|a lot smaller than they appear in the add not very bright unless you look directly at it
B009G43N28|5|I HOPE IT LAST
B00WQ3JNH0|2|Over Priced and poor quality
B000CGFS3G|5|Bought for a 1998 Silverado with a 5.7 Vortec. These engines are notorious for distribitor/spark issues, especially due to aftermarket distributor caps. Delphi/ACDelco are the ONLY caps I recommend to install as the cheap ones from the parts stores/online are very prone to jump spark inside the cap in the plastic between the paths from the rotor to the wire connectors. Do NOT cheap out. Buy this. The truck came in with a no start issue, had spark but very weak spark. New cheap cap and rotor were installed 6 months prior. Installed this and a matching rotor and fixed the issue.
B00QUL6U8Y|1|Junk wont work on a 2001 Buick and my truck (2008 chevy) works only part time. I wont try to get my money back not worth the trouble. You get what you pay for. My fault
B00EVY344K|5|This is the best thing I've found for removing all streaks from the ports for my underwater camera housing. It also works great for drying glass shower doors
B00RDEUKS8|5|I bought extras to give away.I was saluted by a military man and am proud to have this little accessory.
B0027QR2SI|5|Works great in my 2008 jetta!
B0009TTXL4|5|works great
B001F15SO6|5|Plenty of ports!
B00J21N3XE|5|The delivery was spot on and the pleasure to open and find the roof rack put together, just had to put on the &#34;feet&#34; and attach to the roof. Love it!
B000ALJ4NS|5|When nothing else would hold my rearview mirror in place - this stuff did the trick.  I can hardly wait until I find something else to glue up!
B000B7PHQY|5|This one appeared to be American made.  I thought most Champion products have been outsourced to Mexico.
B006EKKFL4|3|the product is good, but it does not fit my 2004 Hyundai accent hatch with 4 cyl engine base model on drivers side which amazon's product match said it would.  the shaft is around 1/3 of an inch too long and does not seal correctly with the transmission and leaks gear oil.  will have to return.  the other shaft I ordered (GSP ncv 37516) fit the left side perfectly and I have no issues with it.  the left side shaft (no this one) came with the nut that holds the shaft in the hub.  this one did not come with a nut i reused the old one not a big deal.  Neither comes with the codder pin (cotter? I don't know how that is spelled).  good value for the shaft considering the CV boots are 18.00 apiece at my local auto shop(in Hawaii).  Both of these shafts have the ABS teeth on the axle.
B001N0E188|5|product was received in excellent condition!
B00LBOK8JW|3|Lights delivered where square and not round.
B006TMOSBU|2|One year later and the glue inside is already starting to come apart. The plastic is a very low quality product and the bulbs will no longer screw in tight.
B00EAOIKWC|5|First time replacing this and have to say once I learned how to do it in my car, it was easy, although it was difficult to put everything back together. Not the fault of the filter though.
B002LF30AO|2|Seat is fine but strap is too short and tight when put around the seat.
B005JPJMI2|5|I love this stuff,I use it when i dry off and then after.Spray a little on car or rag then wipe off.Use on glass and inside on the dash Hell i use it everything.I use this on the shower walls and tub.
B002UC4SWM|5|Extremely well made...delivers as promised..<br />Terrific warranty and very cheap insurance for our Airstream!
B00544ZD86|5|Very bright compared to my old ones
B008CE0W5Y|1|I too found regular ol incandescent bulbs in the side marker, but this was not the amber marker but the red side marker on the tail light. YET the license plate lights are LED.<br /><br />My kit included 2 left side tail light, ok, but now I have a nice bright led light shooting up at the stars. I pulled the lens and blacked it out, but will also have to seal it up with a goo of some sort as rain tends to travel down, and would certainly penetrate the unsealed lens that is meant for the bottom of the lamp.<br /><br />The wire MUST be ran in a Y configuration for anything exceeding 12 ft. I made it on a 18 ft with millimeters to spare, but my trailer was navae set up for a &#34;Y&#34; so.... need a different harness.<br /><br />The connectors are the ol blue taps that corrode easily and just everything about this kit was lacking, wrong, missing, or incomplete.<br /><br />You CAN do better with almost anything else, avoid this product at all costs.
B002UC8LXE|4|great deal, fast service
B00BJ7Z562|5|They  look fantastic , great fit great  price  and really  added  to  the  looks  of  my truck .
B008NDGSHA|1|Horrible quality. I installed and was initially happy with the look but it only took 2 weeks for the emblem to start turning a weird yellow color in the silver areas. Three weeks into it the front emblem cracked. Do not but this item! I am regretting big time and now have to teach out to Amazon cause the return window has now expired (I didn't install them right away, big mistake. Had I, maybe I would still be within the return window).
B0009I5WRO|5|wired in easily.
B00HHGS0NO|5|great buy and seem to operate as expected
B003B44C6U|5|Just what we needed for camping!  Sturdy and doesn't slip, even with no roof rack!
B00MM0OEQC|1|Shipping was fast. Wiring harness melted and almost caught jeep on fire. 1 section stopped working 1 day after instalation.
B00CJ5DY16|2|Do not recommend. I have a '73 Charger, and thought if would be nice to do this by myself and not have to get the wife involved. No such luck. The plate wouldn't consistently seal on the brake reservoir. I tried a number of times, and &#34;finally&#34; got a seal, at least enough to hold the 10 psi the instructions state as being a sign a seal has been achieved. I pumped it up to 15 psi and it promptly burped all over my new asphalt driveway. No seal after all. I fiddled with the plate, trying all relative sealing locations on the reservoir and different torques on the wing nuts that secure the plate to the brake reservoir, but had no resolution to the messy burps (I used a lot of kitty litter to sop up the brake fluid). May work just fine with other brake reservoirs, if a seal is achieved, but I had to get the wife out in the Charger and do it the old fashioned way. Took 5 minutes.
B00VU0VXBY|5|These are by far the best improvement of many I have done to my vw . Easy installation.  Cars handle better and have better traction when the wheels are pointed in the same direction  very slight increase in light road noise but reduced impact on larger bumps or pot holes. Eliminates torque steer all together , full throttle or full brake no need to adjust the steering wheel to compensate. Awesome product! !!!!!    The passat some of the gti,s and the eos have aluminum control arms and it is more difficult to remove and install the bushings do to the roughness of the casting of the control arms recommend soaking it penetrating oil at least one day in advance
B001NZVLEA|5|Great pump! Quiet and effective. Using ACDelco the first time will save you troubles in the future. Will last another 170000 miles I'm sure.
B00MG687JW|5|An essential for any car and as good as any I have used / tested / owned.<br /><br />These are pretty basic in concept. You use them as a portable battery to charge your devices and one day if you have to start a car then it can do that also. 600A peak which should be enough to start most cars and a variety of voltages for different batteries although most of the time you will want it a 12v for a standard vehicle.<br /><br />I have just used it as portable battery and charged my tablets and phones through this as you want to make sure the battery is functional and 'moving' as it is better for the life and performance (when it may really count) of the battery.<br /><br />The hardware feels decent and even has a multi use flashlight for utility. Despite owning many of these I'm yet to come to the rescue with one so maybe they are just making cars better these days I don't know but I'm at zero chance of messing up my car if I need to jump someone else (this happened to me and was an expensive repair)<br /><br />Every car should have one and in time they will be as common place as a tire jack. Like many I assume I have done stupid things like leave lights on and come back to a flat battery but with affordable tech like this it really is a thing of the past.<br /><br />Product provided for review - its just my opinion
B001F0NNA8|5|Works great. got it quick.
B00ULQLR46|2|The covers were poorly made had holes in the seams and didn't fix the seats. Zone Tech responded quickly and sent me a return label,
B00N31LYLC|5|Just what I wanted
B0031BM328|1|This part does not fit my 2010 KTM 690 R  I was also unable to get a refund due to my purchase being outside of 90 days.  I would not get this part unless the manufacturer tells you it fits.  Don't rely on anything you see here.  My last post was deleted, maybe this one will hold since it related to the product.  Product doesn't fit...Product doesn't fit.
B001MOX5KK|4|like
B00ACN3EBW|5|Amazing
B0002JN56A|4|I had mixed reviews on this one.  I remember buying a product that was similar or maybe this same one in the past and it worked really good so I bought this and it didn't work at all even though I read and followed the instructions.  I bought another one though and followed the instructions again and am mystified as to why it worked so well the second time.  So I give it 4 stars since it has worked so well the second time and am so happy that the mirror is not falling off in the heat of the summer.  I just thought of a reason, the second time I used a brand new metal plate that gets glued to the window and attaches to the mirror.  Maybe that was the difference.
B000NU5LP6|5|It isn't making any noise in my limited slip differential, so I guess it's working
B0009X1MHS|5|Put this on the back of my car a little small but works well
B00WVZV074|4|During the day these lights look fine,  but when the running lights are on along with my headlights, the difference between low power running lights and high power turn signal is barely anything. It hardly looks like I'm signaling.
B00BLPT176|2|It fit correctly just hope it stay on. This was little to expensive, needs to be cheater.
B007Q92GT6|5|Absolutely LOVE it. Just wish it came in orange (that's my favorite color)! Fast service and the product delivers all it says!
B00M32ZCEM|5|Plug n play for my 2015 Ram 2500 crew cab.  I installed by myself, but two people would be smoother.  About 3-4 hrs install time.  No major tools requiredright in my driveway, major difference getting in & out of truck, yet completely hidden when retracted.  Love it!
B009DJTEMO|4|Too bad it does not has the center emblem...
B004UTCR1W|5|Love this tag-especially since my 'Rango is the same red as the Ram on the tag. Item arrived QUICKLY! Thanks a bunch!
B0006VHELQ|5|It's AWESOME!! Installation was very simple and my wife is a very happy lady..
B000BZG62K|5|It does it's job.  But I rated it 5 stars because of the value, when compared to the same sensor at any of the local auto parts stores.  It was an exact fit for my OEM in my '03 Alero 3.4 liter.
B00SS14WU2|5|I chose these for comfort over looks. I ride long distance and wanted comfort. Most of what i thought looked much better were solid with only rubber isolators under the solid top. These have the rubber isolators plus the large rubber pads for your feet to rest on. Tell you what once i put these on they look damn good on the bike and are very comfortable. I was very pleasantly surprised at the looks on the bike. I definitely chose right for these have looks and comfort the best of both worlds.
B00F7H0SAI|4|Worth the money.
B00JN2N5C6|5|Fit perfect and in great shape when arrive
B00BFDFT98|5|Came quickly, correct part, great price. Perfect.
B006V3XNE0|5|Seems to be a high quality sticker. I hope it lasts longer than the previous one.
B00LH4MAY2|5|EASY ENOUGH TO INSTALL, FITS WELL. ONLY THING IS THE DIRECTIONS NEED TO BE CLEARER. CALLED PSI AND THEY WERE VERY FRIENDLY AND HELPFUL ON HOW TO INSTALL THEM.
B004C6OBBC|3|as advertised, bigger size than I needed, may need later threw in bin
B0066TF4YG|5|exactly as needed
B00DSPVBP2|5|Exactly what I needed.
B0050GURVQ|1|This helmet did not meet our expectationa at all.  First off, the sizes are out of what, not to to what they say, 2ndit was falling apart when we opened it.  The back head cushion was not attached it seemed cheap and it looked used?I have to mail it back for the 2nd time-very inconvenient
B006P87CUM|5|Just got my vest back. Looks great! It's a big patch, so it will fill the back of a vest. I would recommend it.
B0082GKQQW|4|not quite as thick as I imagined, but way better than what I had
B0058HZK4Q|5|Worked as expected
B0082A9QSW|5|Great for the money, you just have to make sure you hold them tight to the car while tightening them up
B0055KTFTM|5|Easy to install, easy instructions. Looks amazing, great bright LEDs. Very impressed
B009S7I96I|5|It arrived in just two days. It was a perfect fit, easily installed.
B009HQGJ6W|4|I have used many different moog parts in the past and they are absolutely fantastic so im sure these will live up to the moog name. However for the price I would expect made in america parts. Mine were made in mexico and my experience with Mexican parts is they do not hold up like genuine made in america parts. Time will tell..
B005BFKDOW|5|As described. It fit a 2005 E500 base.
B0089AJYNW|4|I've had these installed on my Z for almost a month now, and they've performed great.  Lots of stopping power, and almost no added noise.  Once in a while there's a bit of a squeal at parking lot speeds, but not all the time.  Dust wise they perform, phenomenally!  They make less break dust in a month than my old pads made in 3 or 4 days.
B00CORBQUA|5|Very excellent and provide the demand for appointment
B0006Z9SPW|5|Yeah awesome products very shine.
B004RCP49O|5|This truly is the best stuff to seal joints on your RV.
B00EQ01PZ4|5|Used on our retro camper.  Works well
B00EE56UAG|3|works fine
B004GCY9I2|5|Excellent product would recommend
B00T31OTFY|5|Great price and perfect fit. Saved over $200 off dealer cost. Installed in 5 minutes easiest tail light change Ive ever done!
B006H81NA0|4|Havent installed yet..no instructions included.they can be found on internet using search.not very clear and no pictures,although you can find pics of ones posted on forums.
B00KFS11W8|5|Great quality with an ideal fit.
B00B0N1XQQ|5|Excellent  fit and finish
B007G7PWSA|5|As advertised.
B007Y59CQM|3|different than advertised, but will do the job
B00L4QACFM|5|I gave it to my sister, and she loved it!
B0016KBU3E|5|The only problem I had that was the bolts included with the product would not go through the frame rail on my 2007 Dodge Caliber. I had to spend nearly $10 to purchase automotive grade 1/2 inch bolts, washers and lock nuts to complete the installation. The fit was great and even though I had to spend extra money, it was well worth the price.  It even came with the draw bar to attach the ball too.  I was not expecting that, nice bonus
B00FRHOC82|5|works
B000GZPL30|5|Awesome exactly what I wanted. Arrived really fast.
B001418ZEM|5|Love my sticker!
B005N538FG|5|Great! You wanted the best (seat cover) you got the best...hottest band in the world KISS!
B00HZSNV4C|5|Very Good Product. Quick Shipping.
B000FGM3MW|5|Easy to install and calibrate. Worked great the first time we used it.
B00CQC68G0|5|as good as the original
B00ECXSZRG|4|It looked awesome on my line green car. I only had a day before my back window wipe scape it off the window when it was raining.
B000BOC2E2|5|Never used this product before but it worked great on a slow leak on my riding lawn mower tire.  Just follow simple directions and hope you have same success as I experienced.  Would use again but hope no more leaks.
B00VX7CK4S|5|I am admittedly sloppy when it comes to keeping my car clean. I don't know why because I'm crazy OCD when it comes to cleaning my home but my car just isn't the same. When I got the chance to review the Trash-Zilla Hanging Car Trash Can I was extremely excited because it would give me no excuse for having my car be a complete mess. I have to say it definitely fulfills it's duty and more.<br /><br />What are the features?<br />#1 Best selling 2-in-1 backseat car organizer and trash bin is made from soft yet super strong and easy to clean nylon.<br />Large front pocket perfect for storing anything you wish (I use it for papers or receipts)<br />Features 2 handy see through mesh pockets perfects for sport bottles or extra drink holders.<br />Hangs over any headrest and swings forwards or backwards for access from the front seats or back seats.<br />Auto litter bag features heavy duty Velcro closures to keep the trash out of sight when it's not in use.<br /><br />First off, I must say this Trash-Zilla Car Trash Can arrived super fast! Kudos to the company and Amazon for the crazy fast shipping! The car organizer/trash bin has been an absolute life saver. I am a rather lazy person so whenever I have trash in my car I always think, &#34;oh I'll throw that away later&#34;. Well as we all know later never comes until the trash is driving me insane. This Trash-Zilla Car Trash Can keeps the garbage contained and out of sight until I have a few extra moments to throw it away.<br /><br />This car trash can is extremely well made, and it seems they have thought of everything. I personally have two favorite features of this product; 1. The lining is WATERPROOF and super easy to wipe clean. This is perfect for me because I keep Lysol wipes with me in my car so I can throw them away and not worry that they are getting a bag all wet. 2. The large front pocket is perfect for me to keep papers and receipts in. I feel like papers always pile up in my car to the fact that I can keep them organized until I have a moment to go through them really helps a lot.<br /><br />If you are are looking for a high quality auto organizer/trash can you should check out this one by Trash-Zilla. It has been a life saver!<br /><br />I received this product for evaluation free of charge. I thoroughly test out each product before leaving my reviews and I speak truthfully.

B00VF7KX8G|5|Great. Just what I  was looking for.
B00FM7H4FK|5|Seller sent detailed instructions on how to apply it, which was great. I've applied these types of decals before and this one applied very nice with only 1 small bubble.  The color isn't as bright as the picture shows but it's still very bright, I actually like the color better than the one shown!
B007JSGR9Y|5|Worked great on my 2004 Subaru Impreza WRX!
B000F13I4Y|1|Did not fit.
B007RY0E8U|5|All balls bearings have always been great quality replacement parts. Usually last longer than stock.
B000C9PZVI|5|Genuine Delco, USA made, half price..<br />1970 El Camino
B000CQQKGU|5|Good quality.
B00KGIC96Y|2|I received them after a pretty substantial wait via snail mail, and upon opening the envelope I immediately notice they aren't separated leaving it up to me to cut them apart. The second thing I noticed is they were poorly cut out with scissors, and are not square, and lastly, the free hunting permit is for 2014/2015, and it's a pricing the end of 2015 now. Overall I'm not impressed with this seller. There are better ones out there for about the same price.
B00B5OB7O8|5|easy to install and very reliable. All lights where tested before installed and if they didn't work it was just a bad connection
B0024E6W02|5|Very good product for the price. Does everything I need it to. Good quality in the hose and connections. One thing I wanted was a clear 90* bend coupler to be able to see when I am done draining which this does not have.
B006N969QG|5|My husband was very happy with this item
B001GC2LVM|4|We have only used them one time but they worked very well and easy to use.  I highly recommend them.
B00ONGWYCY|1|I bougth it for my Ford Escape 2008 and it doesn't fit.
B00DZLW2QQ|5|Worked great!
B002G47GE6|5|Fit my 2014 VW Jetta Sportwagon as advertised.  Nothing like having a fresh set of wipers for the rain!
B003F8JSH0|5|Great product at a great price!
B005G2R136|5|Fast Shipping, Great Product, Excellent....
B001ABMSGW|5|I got this item for my 2008 Audi Q7 3.6 premium gas, and it fit like a glove, its too early to tell if it provides any benefits but if you have an AUDI Q7 make sure you buy this dry filter instead of buying the oily K&N filters that messed up my air filter sensor.
B00KTHUUHW|5|Just transferred the guts of my old clicker and it worked first time and every time.
B00UN75FNW|5|Love it, kills cigarette smoke smell in my car.
B00D1SWWGS|5|Very nice thick leather with a dark rich brown color
B00LT33KIQ|5|a little pricey but fits like a glove.  perfect.
B003VASJN6|4|This is great and self centers. The sender does not respond to messages at all but Amazon Customer Service always does.
B002MXE1XA|4|lock set is ok, just not a favorite of the type keys that come with them. they look like the type keys that fit cold drink boxes which mean they are round and don't fit very well in my pocket.
B0002UEN1U|5|Used it to reattach oil pan. No leaks - what else would I want?
B00UAFDUZM|5|came quickly, easy to install, works great
B0095EX59U|4|Descent pads for a good price and shipping was fast!
B00F4MQJ5O|5|SUPER BRIGHT!!  This light bar is great, especially for the price!  It will absolutely light up a football field with how bright it is.
B0012TPTRW|4|Good article.
B00R3KUS3Y|2|Didn't fit with stock had to make it fit by cutting brackets
B00OPBD3OU|5|Easy to install and adjust! Love them. I get compliments on them all the time!
B00JNR2MGQ|5|Excellent product, makes it possible to install the Scala Rider G9x basically on every half helmet. My wife uses it with a beanie, I on a HD-S1V. The kit provides the ability to use ear buds and that is the kicker :) B2B communication at its finest.
B0075JYPNM|1|Unlike other vinyl decals, this is a sticker as they claim. The quote is printed on the sticker and it is very apparent if the window has any slant to it.  I would not recommend this to anyone.
B00HNHS7T4|4|Very nice roof rack but the mounts did not work with a Suzuki SX4 even though the ad stated that it would. I had to custom build mounts with straps which seem to work great.
B003VAYMB4|5|fit exactly and function correctly
B00TZ8HT5M|5|Good products for the price and fast delivery.
B003XI3NJ6|4|Love them
B004I135ZO|5|Works perfectly on a 2009 kia spectra EX. Easy install. Would purchase from here again if I need any other parts!
B000WHPEW0|5|Perfect fit for my 85 Toyota MR2.  My mechanic rates it high for quality.
B00NTHZ7HC|2|It fit my bike but it leaked gas out around the gas cap
B00ELJ5HHM|1|It wasn't the hit I thought it to be and was told to remove.
B00RJC64PW|5|Good quality, good price
B0039001TI|1|Not what it was supposed to be
B004J0UIH2|5|A+ VERY GOOD CONDITIONI
B000XMI1LK|5|Worked great!
B000GROHQ0|2|For the price does the job, but gets brittle quickly and cracks.
B00H879U7M|4|The internal tumblers did not fit in the old, the tumblers should've been included or stated that you need new to marry parts
B003808EZ2|5|Fits the VN1700 on a 2011 Vaquero just like the OEM filter. No issues with gaps or difficulties installing. Just make sure you start the &#34;top&#34; fastener first and don't tighten it down too much until all three are started. Then tighten all 3 evenly and not overly tight so the filter doesn't pull away from the housing. Easy install and breathes well.
B002UCYRZU|5|Great product for restoration at a great price with fast shipping!
B0009IQXCM|5|Nice!  Makes my truck looks brand new and it feels very smooth
B0031I2SNK|5|Great product
B00SVRHD22|4|Work well.
B002FS6KXQ|4|I fitted two of these on a 2008 mazdaspeed3. Endlinks fit in perfectly and work great. Been on for about a month now with an upgraded sway bar set to the stiffest setting no issues or clunking.<br /><br />These would receive a 5/5 except that installation is a pain because of the fitting where they need to be wrenched in. OEM uses a hex key to be able to fasten the bolts, these are essentially two nuts that need to be tightened together except that you need a crows foot wrench to get it to work. Luckily I had the right size on hand but others might not.<br /><br />Overall high quality product but some warning about extra tools needed on the actual ad and not in the reviews where some people may not read it would be nice.
B000C5M2MW|5|Best plugs I have used in my bike and I have tried many.
B00RGZWIW0|5|Great product. It has a sturdy bottom panel and collapses flat easily.
B001FKG1ZM|5|Work as advertised. I would make the purchase again.
B001O0CI3M|2|Do not buy if you have a 1993-04 cobra. They are not the right size for them. They are meant for 2005 and up. And the eye in the cobra is a cheap looking gem. Again larger emblems than the stock 93-04 cobras.
B000UK0F64|5|Fit perfectly in to a 1979 Honda CM185T
B00DFMFYCO|5|Looks great on my window, perfect size for a respectable window decal.
B000C5HQPA|5|Product was OEM exactly as advertised.  Installed with no modifications.  Nice and quiet.
B0040CYWX0|5|Works in my king quad 700&750
B007NGB210|5|Extremely happy with this purchase. Got many compliments.
B0040MFHY8|5|Great
B00U8RP7T4|5|Good price.  Good products.
B005VKBZVW|5|fit perfect.
B00C5TNS76|1|Plactic piece not impressed
B000BQSIWK|1|Worked fine for about a year and then just stopped working.  Junk.
B002SSIBSA|5|Great product and excellent directions.
B000AP57OY|5|PERFECT WORKS GREAT
B00NQGCDC8|4|Good cheap deflator. Not sure how accurate gauge is but it does a good job getting the air out.
B001EAQTRI|5|Made a huge difference in sound quality when using an external (USB powered) Bluetooth adaptor (SB360) into my head unit. Took all of the noise out of the signal.
B0038B7H40|1|Only got one.  Unfortunately it arrived on Saturday so I'll have to wait until Monday to sort this out.  And I was so excited to install these but now I'm waiting to put these in or return them.  Will update......
B001KMO1JI|5|Direct replacement.  Easy to install, perfect fit.
B00E84152Q|3|Horrible instructions that were incorrect.  Cheap product.  The wires are the lowest quality you can find.  Have to drill holes under your power valve and battery tray.<br /><br />However the lights are bright and they all seem to work well when you figure out how to install and splice wires.  I probably paid a little too much.  I feel 30$ would have been plenty for he quality.  Should have paid a little more and got a nicer setup.
B001BK04B8|5|nice replacement electric mirror,easy install
B00QMWQSAG|4|Item arrived on time and was as described. Good deal! The quality of the mat is good for the price.<br /><br />The driver's side mat is just slightly long for my Nissan Leaf. The rear mats fit fine and the front passenger's side mat is a smidge too long but fine as well. Can't complain as this is a generic mat, not a custom fit.<br /><br />Overall, recommended.
B00MQ5Z5F2|5|Worked great except the car battery adapter didnt show I had wires crossed and they refunded me for it and the new one works great!
B00S5NS9W0|1|I did not receive a set of two.I only received one.
B00EA0ZB7I|5|Great lights and the delivery was fast.
B00O8ZNJ2Y|2|Bulb had to be modified to fit the application. First time for purchasing this brand. Will go back to Cree lights they have been exact replacement.
B00DUV392C|5|Replaced the filter on a 98 Lexus GS400.  It took about a minute, Quicker than loading a disc into the CD changer.  I just popped out the little panel in the glovebox, pulled out the old, slid in the new.  The old one was full of debris, and had a hole in it.  Turns out it was the source of this whining sound I heard when the A/C was on high.
B00HJEGQQ2|1|One has failed after only two months of usage on my vehicle. Very disappointing.
B000NO7NC6|5|Thx
B0082365AQ|5|nice dolly
B00DQJA5XO|5|Great product
B001VZN6ZE|1|this product was not good for my diesel truck. it made my truck throw out a lot of smoke and it was suppose to give me better mileage per gallon and it did not
B000C5WCUE|1|Onboard computer in the Camry would not recognize this
B00550JPQK|5|Good
B000C2UKCO|5|Delivered on a Sunday!  Wow!  Great service and fit perfectly.
B000N8ZX9W|5|Excellent product!!
B00BXLE7M2|4|Exactly as described.
B00T0X800K|1|Didnt even fit my car they knew and sent it anyway saying thats all they had.
B00JVHLS3G|1|It was a waste of money the emblem flew off my car on Day 2 seems like the glue came off and it made a scratch on my Car.<br />Definitely would not recommend it to anyone ..invest more money and get a proper one from the stealership or else..just live with it. DO not waste your money on inferior products.
B004J00GII|2|Magnetic flaps don't work. Actually not really magnetic at all. A small snap that doesn't hold much especially at highway speeds. Kinda surprised Kuryakyn is supposed to be good stuff.
B00JBI4YL8|5|Perfect fit. Easy to attach
B00SZZKU02|5|You want to go out and race? The GOOFIT 100cc Big Bore Performance Kit will have you feeling like a professional racer. The kit will have you running on all cylinders. It certainly makes sense for you to be able to look at the different pistons and gaskets. Lenders have to be able to make sure that you can make a proper payment on your souped up racing car aspect.  You can even look at a V6 engine as a baby tool when you know how to use this performance kit correctly.  The performance kit may make you feel like you are ready to spend some time on the highway.
B00OKR4QKE|3|Had a chip on the edge of one of the lights
B00KET8III|5|good bargain
B000765DH2|5|perfect fit 2004 pathfinder full size spare
B00Z0DQ51U|5|The GOOFIT Wrench Screwdriver set tool basically has everything you do not additional screwdrivers all is contained in it.Something about this tool it is firm making it easy to work with.It has an admire size that does not bother carrying it around.I would like to thanks the seller for providing a such a nice tool.
B003COTFS4|5|The superwinch is a super winch. Winch needs to.be designed so the winch has mounting holes on top of the winch as well as the bottom.  Will not fit the rubicon without mounting upside down.   Overall the winch itself is good.
B004SSEF56|5|Excellent you gotta trust me its worth it!!
B00LB2QW6M|5|This is one of their best in my opinion. I have almost all of the swiss tech tools. This one is built in a way to where when im using it i can get a better grip and better torque or leverage.
B00JA3BMDW|5|This thing works great. I was hesitant that it would not because it was so cheap...but I was wrong. This is an excellent product and it measures everything accurately. I am surprised this is not more expensive.
B00NAB74CI|5|Great fit. Fantastic.
B000C5FKM6|5|Excellent fit on my ranger 3ltr. No leaks and running just fine.
B00KTJ4WMO|5|No problem setting up but be sure to include the original fobs along with the new ones when programing. I chose red so that it would stand out on the key board when the vehicle was in for servicing. So far no complaints. Cost wise, way cheaper than dealer fob. Only time will tell as for dependability.
B00K8DMCM8|5|Looks good, good product and came fast. A+
B00167R1SA|5|I bought this to use with my garmin. The install was a breeze. I recomend thinking out how you run the wires before you start (I had to redo it once because I wasn't happy with where the wires ended up). It looks great and is fully functional. The weather cap fits snug and seems like it will last. Good buy, I recommend it.
B00EA0ZB7I|4|They are decent lights. Cheap, effective, and provide good light. I wish they would simplify the mounts. Make them more like the old tractor lights.
B00F7GZI68|4|Was way bigger than expected.
B00DSD5C7W|5|Good size, quality sticker
B00PX6DV84|5|Great fit! Easy installation!! Low price made everything THAT much better! Just wish you had armrest covers.
B004XG3MJ8|5|Well I didn't save a tree with it but it did work great. I used it with my 12,000lb winch to remove a tree and stump. I even had to switch to a snatch block so I was pulling with ~24,000 lb of force and it worked great. It is a good sturdy design. I used a D-ring to connect the winch to it and didn't notice any issues with any of it. The black protective wrap on the loops even held up well.
B00873J0YY|5|Very pleased with these racks. Despite other reviews, had zero problems assembling them. They are &#34;cheaper&#34; material than name brands but look to last long enough to buy another pair later years and still be ahead of buying better brand. They fit both our vehicles (suburban and rav4 ) and have manged several trips fully loaded without issue, provided straps work great too. Didn't change a thing.  Highly reccomended, why buy the expensive version you don't need,  spend savings on another kayak!
B00BNVJUC4|3|Bought it to service my washer's shock absorbers. Though listed as dampening grease, it is still too thin. Easily washed away with water as well.
B0081OSRT8|5|This worked wonderfully on my vehicle.  Definitely understand why they caution you about not dropping the clay bar.  Took everything off the car wonderfully - picked everything up off the ground even better!
B005KJ3210|5|They are an assume deal. no need to find my reading glasses while driving to see.
B000IYHGAK|5|Wires fit perfectly on my ranger 3.0, excellent quality.
B00AWXXUY8|5|Just beautiful!
B001UEBXLA|5|Great would reccommend
B00GKB7IVC|5|Came quickly, correct part, great price. Perfect.
B00480BWCI|5|I got these to replace some 4 x 4 wood blocks used to level our camper & they work great! My wife likes the way they pack when not in use & how easy they clean up. Good product, very satisfied.
B005UQQARG|4|Just installed these in both our cars and they fit perfectly and catch any dirt or liquids that get spilled and saves the cars carpets.
B00U24MEQC|5|Phenomenal product! Easy installation and eye catching,  Buy now!
B004K8KZ8K|5|Nice fit.
B00K0WR7VI|5|Fast shipping and good price!
B00073W9NQ|5|I installed these on my 2015 Ram 2500, and they fit and look great.
B00J9T0ZQM|5|This switch works great and was incredibly less expensive than getting it from the Dealership
B00WL11AMS|5|I used it only once to fill up the tire pressure. It took about 5 minutes to go from 15 to 32 psi. Product looks really nice and cable /hose arrangement is well though out.
B00B9EY8K4|5|Although it was packaged funny, the grille was in excellent condition when it arrived. Removal of the old part and installation took MAYBE three minutes. This thing looks GREAT!!
B000XEGEWG|2|I was not too happy with these for automotive work.  They may be good for interior cleaning but they did not seem robust enough for waxing.  I ultimately returned them for nice Chemical Guys towels.
B00L4TF32G|4|I ordered this product based on researching and comparison reports.<br />I bought a 2015 Jeep Cherokee and it has a lot of plastic in and out so I figured I need a gallon.<br />I sponge brushed it on and it leaves a sheen but not too glossy.<br />Really don't know how it will stand up over time, but I'm sure I'll find out.<br />I guess because it not oil based I feel better putting on a $35,000 vehicle.<br />Not sure I'm going to use it on the leather even though reports say you can use it on treated leather.<br />Don't want to find out the hard way, so I'll stick to a product specifically used for leather.
B000CNAO9W|5|cant beat the looks for the money - great product
B00DSVMCUY|5|Great quality, price and value. Thick leather vest, bought just in case I go down onto the asphalt. Fit was a bit larger than I had expected, so it's true to size for me. Thanks on this great product.
B00PJ1QTMS|5|We used them on our skirts for a 50's party. We were a big hit.
B0009PCPNQ|3|It does make the small of the car like new(kinda), i think it cleaned but nothing very noticeable.
B00BCRMBSO|1|Disappointed with quality, will be sending these back.
B000C92WSM|5|Great Pads quiet no vibrations and stop very quick
B003VAXCWO|5|Cost effective way to lock down your Tacoma tailgate. Just makes it a bit more of a challenge for tailgate theft.
B000C57KDI|5|Great service, product was perfect.
B00BWRIBPQ|5|Perfect fit right out of the box. Really looks good on my black F150
B007VRBDU6|4|For those of you who have one of these you need to order the video from &#34; Precision measurement supply&#34; it is a very good instructional video and walks you through the use of this tool
B00AZMICOY|5|I purchased a 40 and 64 oz. as a gift, but i personally have them both and used them extensively for 4 years now.  They keep ice water cold for many, many hours even in direct summer sun and even when i leave it in the car in the hot sun.
B0002SREP4|5|I needed to convert a U.S. threaded holder to take a metric threaded device.  With the Bosch CO2148 21/64 drill, I was able to achieve the mechanical results required.
B003VAUMX6|5|Great product solved my issue.
B003VLBPJA|2|Not very good quality.
B00A14QNP6|5|very easy to install, took less than 15 minutes. everything works fine, all my windows work again.
B00CMUD8E6|5|fits much cheaper than the dealer easy to install
B007RYUWXM|1|did not work as promised
B00PQMHHW6|1|Started off looking great. But two months of sun exposure has made them fade. They look terrible now and they are not as reflective as the good quality tape. Also, they are starting to lift and peel off my truck, even though the surface was clean before application. Spend a few more dollars for quality tape and save the frustration later.
B000HUN9UG|5|Quality parts
B00KG34WB4|1|Does not fit at all. Do not buy
B000C5FL7K|4|looks good  no oring with it
B004GCK97M|1|It was not packaged very well! Found out after I tried to install it that it was bent out of shape. I had to do a lot of bending to get it to fit the bumber mounts and valance properly.
B003TP7BNW|5|Just what I needed!
B00842A7F4|1|Didn't get the dash mount stuff with it.
B000RFUF12|5|you need this
B0049E7NIA|5|Just what I needed for a lot less price.
B001QVI57M|4|Great absorption. Wish it were larger, however.
B00HY06JTK|4|Could be a little brighter - but nice and easy otherwise!
B00BVPU4J0|1|Aftermarket - low quality/poor engineering design. Actuator arm was not properly bonded (ultrasonic welded?) to the drive solenoid shaft.  So it arrived loose from the assembly and would not work or stay in place on its own. Designed to fail prematurely! Had to return.
B005N723QY|3|nice shirt...thin material
B00BGDOFBU|5|Perfect fit if you choose the size right.
B00RGZWIW0|5|very nice. fits all my items.
B00AX7OESE|1|This item is not correctly aligned (the holes for mounting) and it's made with cheap plastic.  This item cracked at two mounting points and when you close the hood, it will crack the body of the shield.  So, if you're looking for a reliable/well made product, look elsewhere.
B00Q7U8U9A|5|This set of replacement regulator repair parts work perfectly, and are fairly easy to install. I understand that Jeep probably made the original parts of plastic in an ill-advised bid to shed weight, but the parts they made were woefully under-designed and should have been re-engineered after the defects started to show up in so many vehicles; the Liberty I worked on had ALL FOUR windows inoperable because of the broken plastic OEM parts.<br /><br />These parts are steel, and well made. They fix the problem and probably will last longer than the vehicle they are installed in. They will require that you have at least some mechanical skills and access to either a hand file or a Dremel tool (preferable) with a small cut-off disk for modifying the cable in the regulator.
B00XPL88NC|5|This is the perfect tire pressure gauge, I love it!
B00II5YADC|5|Used it once and it works great.
B00QY3R6OU|5|works perfect for AN fittings. and doesnt break the bank when buying
B00SRW9DVA|5|I think it's for adults or teenagers not for kids because it's gonna be big on their faces
B00CFPSEZ6|5|better than I expected.  I wanted something to block the space above the rear-view mirror, for east-west communing.<br />This fits behind the passenger visor, and extends further than I expected, and more easily also.  I removed the plastic part that drops down, as i sit tall enough not to need it.<br />One worry: instructions warn not to leave it down when parking the car in the sun.  If I forget and it warps to uselessness, I'll update this review.
B00U5UBQE4|5|just what i needed!
B0035TW0GK|5|Installed on my 06' yamaha 1700. Great stopping power. Made a huge improvement
B003LJ0V7O|5|As expected and on time delivery. Satisfied.
B0009XFYCW|5|This cover fits snug but well on my 2008 Harley Vrod. I live beachside in FL so need something to repel the salt without converting my carport into a garage. Time will tell how effective it is when battling the salt air but I'm keeping it waxed, and this badass cover on it is good so far.
B001S874F2|5|This product delivers.
B00G4BXCYA|4|This tonneau cover is pretty good.  I got it on time and it was fairly easy to install.  There were some parts of the instruction that was confusing but in the end it was assembled properly.  It took me approx 2 hours to install.  So far am I very satisfied with my Deuce tonneau cover.
B00N48BEN2|1|Didn't get to use this kit had to send back
B001TNT2Y2|5|Worked great
B000C9U126|5|This part was an exact OEM replacement for my 2003 Pontiac Montana and has performed satisfactorily for the past month. . A word of warning, however......Make sure that no one inside the vehicle opens the left rear sliding door while refueling the car with the gas cap removed. The rearward action of the door movement will strike the cap and break the tether strap attached to  the cap requiring replacement. This is what happened to me and the reason a replacement cap was required.
B00Y111CVK|4|Yea there nice
B0017LKUEC|5|Simple, direct, functional. Do not use on seized coils as they can bend under great force.
B000CM0W7C|5|I'm so glad and happy that I made this purchase!!!
B00BYH6C1E|4|Keeps my phone, change, etc from getting lost between the seat & the center console. Although it advertised a slot for your phone, neither seat gap filler had one.
B00GX3141C|5|I bought this for my 2013 Ford F150xlt  and it fit perfectly and it looks great! It was really easy to install  and the service  was excellent,it came in just a couple days. I would  recommend this for anyone looking to  give there  F150  a new look
B00HTOB0NG|5|Used with a kensun HID kit for my 1999 BMW 540I. As far as I know they work because I have no error messages since installing.
B006M8KNEC|5|fits great in 2015 Forester, convenient storage size for a wide range of small items like shoes and grocery items you don't want sliding all over the place
B009VYWJ0A|3|the picture was not that great.
B001RGAPFG|4|Good article.
B00JXZR6CI|5|This wax goes on easily and can be removed  just as easy with a glossy shine. Real good product.
B00C8UR9FY|4|Accurate Description, Well Packed, Fast Delivery & Great Price
B007XJ6O8I|5|VERY GOOD
B003O6BWIQ|5|Bought these for my 06 Polaris Sportsman 800. As always, they were delivered quickly. Put these on along with new ball joints and front bearings. I use the 4 wheeler for duck hunting and it spends a lot of time driving in the water so a necessary 3-4 year change out. All is well!
B00OABDOCG|5|Great product.
B000WEOT5G|5|It took a bit of work to get it on as it was different than the one previously on there.  But, it's on and it's working great!!  Thank you.
B00HJ15AJ4|5|Looks really nice on my new GMC Terrain with all the chrome. Stays on fine and I don't see a problem with tags being covered s some have said.
B00D5O1WNM|5|I ordered this cover as a light dust and rain cover for my 2015 C400. Although the product doesn't list my model as a compatible vehicle it still fits. The body dimensions on a C350 and C400 are the same. Only difference is a little extra material around the mirror flaps because the C400 has automatic folding mirrors. This cover reflects a lot of the hot south florida sun as well. Seems sturdy and has elastic at the front and rear for snug fit.  Does not have an inside liner. Repels water quite well.
B007HRZ6L2|5|Great awning.
B002F4RENK|5|Applied to my Coleman cooler n looks great,it really stuck to the cooler surface nicely  (which i was worried cause i had applied a different type sticker on another cooler n did not stick)but this one is different and i highly recommend this item.
B00OAC0GQW|5|Great quality product! They are adjustable also which is nice.
B00KTI06AM|5|I had no problems programming these to my vehicle.  Saved me hundreds of dollars not having to go to the dealership to get new keyfobs
B00EF3P63O|4|Not bad, not the sturdiest roof basket I've ever seen but definantly what you pay for. I did add some black silicon around the joining seems, black zipties across the bottom where the grate meets (trimmed down of course), and swapped out the decal that came with it for a white Palmetto Tree and Cresent vinal decal from Garnet and Black Traditions. Also used some black spray paint to cover up a few minor scratches. Gotten a lot of complements!
B00LADOPL6|1|Complete Junk. Pulled lightly to stretch boot over terminal after install and the thing fell apart.
B00MVMRS6O|5|Good product with very low price. Very bright.
B00480N0SC|4|They are not as bright as I expected then to be, but they are good lights for different types of conditions. I have had them for quite a while and have not to replace them.
B000JFL7ZS|4|It does NOT fit my Audi Q7 4.2 filter cap. It's a 32mm hex - this one is too big. I'm not going to return because i don't think it's worth the trouble, but i just wanted to let people know about it. If you have this engine you may want to check first.
B000Y89T1E|5|thank you for having this panel
B001L4KIHE|5|Feat product. Easy installation.
B002YKIZBA|4|It works and made getting some hoses off much earier.  Once again use the right tool for the job.
B00JTUBP6U|5|Smooth running engine (Mazda Mazda5)
B00062Z5XY|5|Serves its purpose, for those saying it was a pain, they're wrong, you don't have to replace any wiring running to the starter, as long as you mount the solenoid near the original battery (worst case scenario is to use a large butt connector to extend any cable). The best advice I can give is follow the diagram provided(instructions were rather wordy).  Overall it does its job and is easy to install(idiot proof) it recommends some 2 gauge wire for the new battery FYI. For that the 2gauge temco welding/battery cable I found on Amazon works perfectly. Just need battery cable lugs and a pair of crimpers
B000K8UMFU|5|Bought it for my niece, she really love it
B00KIVTKT8|5|great
B004AQYY84|5|Exactly as described. Fast Shipping. Thank you!
B006GJYP5K|5|This stuff cleans the white vinyl like nothing else.  The seats look new every time I use it to clean the boat!
B006X98A7C|5|Saved a ton of money on this item
B000ET525K|5|This is all you need for emergency tire repairs.  Simple and easy to use.  Great for when you pickup a nail or screw.
B003KFR5N2|5|Put front struts and rear shocks. What a difference. Only took an hour and thirty minutes.
B00JQ26CUK|4|works great & inexpensive
B003IS3HV0|4|Delivered in two days. Works great. Seams a little sticky at first but soaks in and really conditions the leather well
B00AVM1ET8|5|Fast shipping. Plenty of paint to cover many ding and scratches. Color was a perfect match.
B00GTJV9RY|5|Perfect fit!
B001O28622|5|I love this thing! I noticed an improvement right away. The unit has been installed for a month now and my gas mileage is up and the engine is running much better. I had nothing wrong with my engine and expected not to see much if any results, I just wanted one. :) So to have results this good are awesome!! I did have to adjust my timing a little but that's ok. :)
B008JORKP2|5|Great little fireplace. It puts out a lot of heat and it works great for the campground that I go to which doesn't allow wood fires during the dry months. 20lbs of propane lasted me about 6 hours, but the fill is about the sameI would have paid for firewood.
B00VJVQH92|5|Wow, what a hateful angry little pipe. I took my sleek, quiet, well engineered German motorcycle and made it sound like an 800cc motocross bike. I hated it at first, but now I love it.
B00QMWKOTC|4|Pretty nice test pipe i put it on my 95 ej1 was a little tedious to get old cat and bolts off but after that fit great i just used oem gasket it was still good and put the given gasket for the midpipe on works great gave a little more torque, but helps the engine out mainly, only gave 4 stars bc inside of pipe was a little rusty for some reason and fedex is dumb couldnt find my house so had to go pick it up 30 miles away, cheap and works good tho
B00180MT00|5|Fit my Xterra great and seems to work well!
B00EHK0O2I|5|Keeps the car nice and cool.
B006RUJ2D8|5|We were very pleased with this product would recommend to all
B0009IQW78|5|Got it in very quickly in a fram box. Very pleased with product.
B003G6V6O4|5|Cool
B00JG3OIFU|1|Have not been able to use the product because the product didn't come with a spray attachment(even though the picture clearly shows it, and the product description didn't say either).  I will have to update the feedback when I get a chance to use it, as I currently do not keep a stock pile of spray nozzles laying around.
B003IS3HV0|3|Nice product. Can be a bit greasy, but overall ita nice.
B00GSAUHB8|5|A perfect sale from start to finish.
B00CPL10OC|1|Chinese JUNK terrible stopping ability will never buy again
B000C57KVK|5|Just installed these on my 01 Chevy S10 Xtreme, one of the best purchase's I've made so far. My truck drives nice and smooth now, didn't realize how bad it actually was until I swapped out my old dead ones for these. Shipping was fast, and install was easy just 3 bolts! Might I add these are listed on Monores website as premium grade shocks and I only paid half the price on amazon vs going to a parts store or any other website! I suggest while your switching out you rear shocks to double check your rear sway bar, found mine was loose. Very happy with this purchase!
B000E9C21M|5|Beautiful and tough!
B00DGXXJ88|4|Son loves it and it's odot certified
B001TXWNLQ|5|Very handy inexpensive item.
B00KGICAUO|4|Fast installment so far works great
B000CQDR5C|5|outstanding i have no complain
B00TWF0KXG|5|Easy to install
B00557QI0Y|5|Worked fine and installed effortlessly BUT: save yourself some time and frustration and make sure you purchase a new nut and outer seal from your GM dealer. You will most likely need the nut because the old one fuses to the old shank, and the new seal (the black ring) will likely break. $10 bucks extra well spent.
B00P2MZLJQ|4|Didn't push the water off like it did in the videos but it did help with the drying process. No water spots and my paint has a nice shine to it!
B00F2GU6U6|5|Better than I expected!!
B002R1FA6O|5|As described, perfect fit? Arrived quickly.
B000C2UKHE|5|Working just fine.  Purchased this and installed in 10 minutes myself instead of paying the ridiculous $167 the dealership quoted me when they changed my oil.
B00COLCX7G|5|Easy to install works well
B00368PY7M|5|Couldn't ask for a better quality item. Better than what I expected. Mishimoto is definitely the way to go
B002N5W8Q4|1|Pure junk, no more to say
B00R5CVD3O|5|looks great and 5 minute installation ,,
B00C5RB03W|3|Looks nice but be careful to check the measurements. I liked the idea of the air vents to air out the bumper. Turns out there are at least two different bumper sizes.I had the 4&#34; square so these are too small. I'll have to reorder the correct size. They do look very nice . It's just too bad they're too small for my bumper as I'd rather use these than the more solid variety..
B0064GVXE6|4|This works great and for the price it's hard to beat.. I threw out the plastic braces and bought metal 8&#34; brackets from hardware store.. It's suffice for a console and works for me. If you're a &#34;heavy leaner&#34; and rely on support I strongly suggest beefing up the brackets and the console mount itself.  Mine is mounted to floor and not to the existing center console where shifter is like it is designed. If you don't mind spending an extra $5 on hardware then this is great.
B00VSDZB4I|5|The first decal was lost in the mail, thanks USPS. Luckily Yoonek Graphics returned my money with no problem. I reordered it again because I just really liked this decal. I wanted something patriotic for my new truck. I received it within a week and I love it!
B004J6KH0Y|4|good price fast shipping
B00CMR79H6|5|Excellent product!
B00BITICRA|5|Good price good product fast delivery
B009XQ5VZQ|5|What you see is what you get!  This is the OEM part. An exact replacement for my 2010 Toyota Prius.  When you first receive the hubcap be sure and notice that it will only look &#34;correct&#34; when mounted on the wheel.  This is because the factory steel wheel can be seen through the openings on the cap yet it looks to be one unit.  Anyway, put the cap on and it will match exactly as described.  Good job Amazon.
B006QZF990|5|everything they said it would and more
B0024NSLJ8|5|So much easier than cleaning with hard to use products that don't last long, nice they came with new bulbs.
B00RZTD4H0|5|Great product, great transaction; would recommend to a friend.
B000I66JEM|5|this is an excellent product for surfers or hunters.  I grab my board lock my key here and don't have to worry about hiding it or losing it in the water.  if I am hunting I don't have to take my keys with me and potentially lose it.
B005ZHSXQG|5|Fit as advertised.
B00K0VW58Y|5|Great product at a great price as promised.
B00D9C2CDO|5|Great purchase!
B000E28KV0|2|Jijdmrhdmn
B00TQ07IOQ|1|These are thin and cheap.  Not &#34;heavy duty&#34; or &#34;deluxe&#34;.  Returned for refund.
B007772HG4|2|Kind of works.  Very cheaply made. Used a few times and haven't used them since. Don't waste your money.
B0067UDHUC|5|This is a direct oem replacement part.And even better,it includes the new plug assembly,not to many others offer this plug.Once again THANK YOU AMAZON.......
B007Z1U1V0|5|Worked and fit perfectly.  Highly recommend these starters.
B000FQ23JK|2|I only was able to use it for a week. The spring broke on it the first time I had to put gas in my jeep.
B00AC6ZRC8|5|Installed this on my 2015 Ducati 899. She has a sexy tail end now.
B000N5UVC4|5|Very good shipping, arrived as advertised
B00LMHP89I|5|Fast shipping and good price! A little big for car mirrors.
B0010GCVU0|5|Exact replacement, lasts longer than generics.
B000ONZNV4|5|As described great.
B00144BF9Q|5|This switch worked great to disconnect my battery from the boat while on the trailer or not in use.  prevents the battery from being drawn down in the event a radio or other accessory is inadvertently left on.
B000CPIN9S|5|I used this product on the headliner and accessories of my E46 and it looks Amazing. I wanted to get rid of the dull grey look that the factory headliner had and give it a rich black look so that it would blend in with the Black Leather seats and dash and it worked great. My only regret is that I only purchased 1 can and did not have enough to finish the entire job in one day. I will not make the same mistake in the future. :)
B009LQXU6A|5|STRONG WORK GREAT 1996 SUBURBAN
B001G7BG4K|1|Took way longer to receive product than expected. Stick was permanently bent, would not straighten completely but was still able to fit in spot where oil dip stick goes. Will it give accurate reading of oil in engine? No. Needs to be protected better when shipped and NOT take a month before delivered!
B007MUXQVG|4|It isn't rainx quality but hey it's fluid and it works.
B000XETMW0|5|I bought this tool as a &#34;be prepared&#34; item, for when I recently replaced the O2 sensors on my car.  I'm glad I did, as it made installation of the new sensors totally problem free.  After removing the old sensors, I ran the thread chaser in and out of each hole.  It seemed to clean up a lot of old rust.  For the price, it was well worth it.
B001A1JW0W|5|Fast shipping and good price!
B0009XQUKC|5|Good piece of equipment
B000E7SY16|5|A  FULL JUG OF BUNGEES!!  WOW!! What an assortment.  Wonderful! We've used a number of them already!
B000WJEORY|5|Purchased this item after discovering it was the same one sold at Harley dealer, but about $8 cheaper.  It works great and is compact enough to keep in tour pack.
B00EAK7IQ0|3|1st time I have used them so will have to wait and see.
B00WOY33EA|5|Back to the way it was.  They work.
B008DR3ZN6|5|For the price you won't find another helmet this nice.  I rode all over Moab, Utah with this and had several wrecks but was never hurt.
B000CFQB7O|2|First kit arrived. The bottles looked old and out of date. Indeed they were! Aeresol oil spray was exhausted leaving me to drive with a dry filter! Luckily Amazon quickly resent me one that was full. Not requiring me to send the other back. Great job on that part amazon! Product is good...once applied appropriately.
B00T36HLYU|5|Fit perfectly. 2014 Chevy Silverado
B00NVI8FPU|5|These are the OEM mudguards for 2015 Camry and 2015 Camry Hybrid.  I installed these on my 2015 Hybrid XLE with no issues.  A couple of suggestions - you definitely need a right angle screwdriver for the front installation, unless you want to remove the wheels.  Also the instructions I found have a typo - on the front wheels you are initially instructed to discard the undercar screw/bolt, and on the next page you are instructed to reinstall the screw/bolt.  You DO need to reinstall this.  Rear wheels do need removed so you can drill 3 holes.
B00RE4HQXY|5|They look awesome!!!
B0017KJ14S|5|Good product and looks awesome on truck.
B00TDDCGNO|5|Great hot light for my RV
B001COAS78|5|Works great. I bought this last year to replace my failing sensor and its worked great, have had no problems with this sensor.
B003V57NUQ|5|Not nearly as hard to put together as other comments led me to believe, and the price can't be beat.  The lashing straps aren't great, so we tend to use something more secure.
B00EPDL7TQ|5|Love it.
B00718W5GQ|5|Great item.  No longer dealing with the extra long cable that came with my trailer.
B001DTNC4S|5|This product is great!!! It took less than 10 minutes (probably less than 5 minutes) to install and it works great. It is mildly less convenient than a permanently installed version but it also $200 cheaper. I would recommend it to anyone!
B001ELZE1E|5|Great quality for the price.
B000I1Y8CM|5|Fast service and product was as described.
B0002SQUG8|5|It works like it's suppose to. No problems.
B00KGICYAA|5|worked great fast shipping
B0106P8YUG|5|Everything fit perfectly
B003SYXMA0|2|Installed on my 2002 Infiniti QX4. Instructions on Nicoforum were very accurate. I did not swap out the bushings. The OEM bushings lasted 135k miles, so I figured I could gamble on these for another hundred! They matched OEM to a tee. There was no cutting or adjustments necessary. I could have used the old bolts, but installed new ones for peace of mind. I also installed KYB shocks while I had the truck on the lift. The ride difference is night and day. The death sway is gone and the shocks stiffened up the rear end. Just for reference, I could stomp on the hitch and bring the rear end down 8 inches. I can barely get an inch with a healthy stomp now! Good combo...Dorman trailer arms and KYB shocks!  Nov 2016 Update: These trailing arms only lasted 25k miles. Utterly disappointed. I've had good luck with other Dorman parts in the past. I ordered the poly bushings from 4x4parts.com but I had serious issues pushing out the bushings. I gave up and ordered a full set of another brand and will try the rubber bushings again. Since I have 160k miles on my rig, getting 50-75k miles is all I'm looking for. I didn't expect 1 year and 25k miles of use to wear them out.
B0070NQQE4|4|well, i was angry that i lost the wire harness for my old timing lite.But after useing this I'am glad i did! The lite is a little dim but the dial system is so much easier to use than digital. The instructions were written by an electrial enginer,ugh! But the product is well worth the price. Great value.
B002528B3E|5|just what we wanted
B007WR6D3M|5|Item as advertised, well packaged and a quick delivery time. Can't ask for more than that. Thank you
B002SA0SCA|5|perfect fit. very fast delivery
B000CHIWIS|5|good filter, easy replacement, gasket is high enough that it seals nicely
B005WVSCEI|5|I have had my plate for 6 months now and has held up well.  Not missing any crystals and they are still shiny and not lost their color.  A little pricey, but worth the quality.
B009138Z4A|4|Makes my Corolla look new again. I love it! 4 Stars because it's not the real thing but comes close.
B00J4VZ2Z4|5|Like them a lot.  Fit over closed face helmet very nicely.  Not tight fitting as edges catch the helmet and keep the goggles from fitting too tight.  Not quite as comfortable on open face helmet but still serve the main purpose very well.
B000QUZ572|5|no more loose
B00JIIZCM6|1|It did not work on a leather recliner that I think has been damaged by hair spray rubbing off on it.
B002N5DE2G|4|Purchased these to have on hand for my car. Safety first.
B001NZTZBQ|5|Fast n great
B007V8NOAC|5|Love it!
B0001EFSTI|3|Great little tool.  All sorts of uses, and I've found myself using it many, many times...however, if you carry your keys in your pocket, it has one fatal flaw.  The sharp edges on it have a tendency to get themselves caught on the inside of your pockets, or jabbing you in the leg.  It would be perfect if it has a soft rubber or vinyl slip-on cover.  So to give you some perspective on how useful I found it, vs this flaw, I find myself willing to carry it on my keyring, wrapped in a layer of electrical tape, vs not having it with me.  A perfect little tool...if they could overcome that one little flaw.
B0095FBQ5E|5|Great stuff
B00NN85SH6|3|item as described, but it does stick out farther than I expected it to so we tend to bump into it with out legs.
B00AZ800SY|5|This part did exactly what it was supposed to do after my regulator just stopped working. I also had to order the regulator motor and ended up doing so on ebay, but the combination of the 2 parts did what they needed to do. My dad is a mechanic and auto body tech and he did the actual work of replacing the parts -- we had to watch some youtube videos because there is a trick to getting this installed -- it doesn't seem like the cables are long enough at first and you really have to almost force it, but in a specific way.
B0040CTUAA|5|Exactly what I needed, should have bought a pack of 100.
B00LW834Z2|5|I ended up having these programmed at the Ford dealership after being cut by a locksmith. My plan was to use the two keys I had and do the ignition switch programming, but the those keys turned out to be clones of one another and so the ignition saw them as the same key. Once programmed, these work flawlessly.
B005F1A5LS|5|I installed the front and rear adjustable sway bars on my 2014 Mustang GT to complement my Eibach Sportline springs, and by far this is the best suspension mod I have done to my car. It corners flatter now with almost no body roll, car is more predictable and it'll correct the rear end itself if you oversteer. Fit and finish is top notch and all the needed hardware is provided in the kit.
B000GTVJAK|5|Nice addition to the black stock knob.
B000COC67E|5|SuperDooper product
B0000AXTUY|5|All went as expected, my unit works just as the article stated, shipment was very timely..tks gnelson
B0015PI7A4|4|works as advertised, glad I got it
B00F3SZLOO|5|Perfect oversized filter for 2013+ (5th Gen) Nissan Altima 3.5 sedan (M20x1.5 threads). The std filter is TINY. Absurdley so. This is slightly longer, though not so long as to touch the plastic splash guard, and is almost a half inch larger in diameter. The bypass valve setting is compatible (12-15psi) and there is noticeably more media surface area than the std sized filter (which can fit INSIDE of a coke can if you cut the top off of the can...two filters can fit and protrude slightly... this is unacceptably small). This is the filter size that WAS spec'd for the 3.5 V6 before Nissan back-spec'd (read: changed retroactively) to a smaller filter that fits both the QR25 2.5 liter 4 cylinder and the VQ35DE 3.5 liter V6 for the Altima. One supposes this was done to keep parts stock counts down for Nissan dealers, but it's BAD for the longevity of your car. You want as much filter surface area as possible to keep bypass events (moments when the pressure differential across the filter media increases to the point that the bypass valve opens to prevent starving the engine of oil). The more media surface area, the fewer times you'll go into bypass, the easier it is on your oil pump, and the higher your cold oil flow rate wil be. If you have startup clatter, this filter may fix that as your engine gets more oil, sooner, upon cold startup. This filter flows extremely well, especially when it's cold outside.  This is basically identical to the Purolator Synthetic PSL14459 (they are both made by Purolator and have identical markings), which is also excellent for the 3.5 liter VQ35DE V6 in the Altima (and also available here on Amazon :) ). The full synthetic, wire-backed media (licensed from Donaldson) has superior flow characteristics to all paper and paper-synthetic hybrid media (mobil 1, Bosch Distance Plus, purolator pure 1, K&N, etc.) media. This is evidence by a smoother startup and faster RPM drop upon cold startup (faster to get to ~750 RPM; normal idle speed). Only Royal Purple, Fram ULTRA, Bosch Long Life, Amsoil EaO, Napa Platinum, Wix XP, and Purolator Synthetic use full synthetic media. Synthetic media has superior flow rates to paper filters, even when holding more dirt, as syn media filters in 3 dimensions and traps contaminants across the physical depth of the filter media...whereas paper only traps contaminants across its surface. Synthetic media flows substantially more oil than paper media in all circumstances.  This Bosch filter is excellent and is a top tier oil filter, offering far better flow AND finer filtration than any factory filter. In a clean engine, and using synthetic oil, this would be capable of much longer than a 10k mile oil change interval. Possibly even 12k-15k miles if your manufacturer allows.  Or two 7,500 mile oil change intervals. Buy with confidence. And the price on Amazon can't be beat. This has M20x1.5 threads and a 12-15psi bypass valve setting.  Note: Some would argue that &#34;all filters work the same&#34;. Maybe this is why virtually ALL over-the-road semi-trucks (and also most heavy machinery) are using Donaldson oil filters with their patented synthetic media...the SAME media you find in these filters listed above. Cuz truckers and trucking companies just LOVE to flush their money down the drain...especially with ever-increasing fuel prices. Lol.  Be honest with yourself; if you have a lease vehicle and don't care about going past your lease term or you trade your vehicles-in at or prior-to 100k miles, then don't bother with this filter. But, if you want to turn your vehicle into a 150k/200k/250k+ vehicle and you want to make it last, then synthetic filters are for you. Seeing that 80% of engine wear occurs within 60 seconds of startup, this filter serves to greatly increase engine life.  Also, there are some who state that, because virtually all oil pumps are positive-displacement pumps, oil flow rate is NOT affected by the oil filter. I'd ask them to speak to the many hundreds of Hyundai owners who had vehicles with startup rattle. Those same owners only changed to a synthetic oil filter (and/or a filter with markedly increased media surface area) and saw their rattle disapear...using the same oil. Did they all have a mass, synchronized hallucination? Or does the oil filter, in fact, make a diference with regard to oil flow? You be the judge. ;)
B00CWMRZEI|1|I would NOT recommend these for any bike , the screw holes are horrible and wont hold . need to be glued , vents rattle worse than a baby's toy
B00B0TMRTM|5|excelent product
B004AIRX9Y|5|Works as expected so far, good price.
B0009V1WS4|5|Works as expected, well built.  I had to use the 1/2&#34; for the stock hitch on my Toyota FJ Cruiser.  I remove the lock after each use and just toss it in the glove compartment until next time.
B000BOC3LY|5|I have used this leather and vinyl cleaner on high quality beige leather and it cleans and conditions better than anything else I have tried.  In my car it removes ground in dirt where my elbows rest on the console and door handle.  The steering wheel is wrapped in black leather and I wasn't aware of how dirty it was until I used this product.
B000BNOI8G|1|I used it two times and  the rotater melted to the bulb
B000ALBZEE|4|Works very well.
B005VA1M4W|3|Its a good exhaust fits my busa
B008RDL78G|5|This rack fit my 2015 jeep just fine. AS noted by other purchasers, the installation  instructions are poor. Scott's #3 comment was key to install, thank you!
B00G6H2WVQ|5|I was a little hesitant about purchasing this packacke for my Girlfriends 2003 V6 Accord since it seemed very cheap. But it exceeded my exptations and everything works well so far. They are very bright.
B00MAJ10IK|5|Very nice

B00D2HW8US|1|Missing parts not pleased
B00EDZD5BO|1|throws check engine light. runs at about 150degrees. even had a tuner installed to kick fans on at 185, needs replaced.
B00NFEPWJW|2|The front cap had a defect in the paint.The edges and tips of all parts were not painted, and are white. I would  suggest that tree he company send a some touch up paint. Also the front cap doesn't have the mounting tabs for the ram air port housings to connect  to like the stock cap.they just float.
B00KTHUZE0|5|like it just fine
B000O04HAA|5|Ok I lost a couple trying to install.  Should have listened to u-tube video.
B00K3XVVMK|4|The fog light switch that comes with it lights up orange whereas all 2011-2015 Sienna existing switches light up green. This is the only reason I didn't give it 5 stars. I also replaced the bulbs with yellow H11's instead of the &#34;blue&#34; bulbs that come with it. Much better look imo.
B003L5KSI0|5|great quality sk2 products as always..
B002X1NLOQ|4|It took us a couple hours to replace this part.  The new part is a little more tight then the old one but function properly.
B001F8OX6I|4|Easy to install after watching the Maxxair installation video a couple of time. The written directions are a bit hard to follow.
B007OW67QI|5|Blade was OK, worked out well.<br /><br />Thank you.
B007BKF0BQ|5|No problems I received it before expected
B004BFXW5A|5|great item to buy with great shipping.

B000MITKOM|5|Bestest, handiest, tool around. Every mechanic needs one of these in their tool box. Enough said.
B0012GTVVA|5|Simple to install and works great .
B00393NDCM|1|Out of everything I'be bought in my life time this is the most useless. These lights are not bright what so ever. They just are not usable. It is unsafe to drive on the road with these lights. Ignore everything the product description says and listen to me, this product is not a good purchase by any stretch of the imagination.
B000EVYGZA|5|great item to buy with great shipping.
B003ALQC3U|4|Great deal - fit perfectly. Only beef is it needed install information.  Also outside grill/ door not included.
B003NU0EM8|1|Couldn't get it to work on any size dent.
B00J8FJA5O|1|These do not fit a 2002 suburban LS. The heads on them are to big. When you go to shut the glass there is a bolt that holds the bracket to the glass and the head of the shock presses against that bolt and pops the shock off.
B00N24KGB4|5|Makes my already sharp looking ride even nicer! This is a great seller with fasting shipping and a great product at an equally great price!
B003V7KNYM|5|Once we received it my husband was able to take the damaged one down and get the new one back up on in about an hour. Had a buddy there so that did help. Tube also was drilled and hole lined up perfectly on our A&E system. Had a little mix up on delivery BUT with the help from Ruth at the trucking line received it just a couple days later after I spoke to her & arranged first available delivery say they had
B00XORKOWU|5|Fit my 2012 JK Unlimited perfectly.  Love the look of this bracket on the Jeep and fit the light bar perfect as well!
B00651CLCS|4|Easy to install. Satellite comes in fine but I do not pick up FM radio stations as well. Not a problem but certainly noticeable. Looks much better than the stock antenna
B00MQ9RAZ6|5|Great stickers, price can not be beat! Looks great on my JeeP!! Thanks.
B0002SRCMO|5|Helped me remove a door panel on my civic when I was fixing the door lock. Also helped out with taking out trim when installing radio. Great little tool. I wish it was a little thinner but still a great product.
B0002STSMQ|1|Had to return it,  didn't work for me .
B00IVIPDBO|5|Saved a lot of money on this one. Worked on arrival and still works.
B000H94F6E|5|Easy to use, intuitive and does a good job for a reasonable price. It automatically chooses the voltage and amperage when you attach the leads to a battery. Practically foolproof.
B012YMDPHG|5|This scanner is great for figuring out those pesky check engine lights!  It's easy to hook up and fits nicely in your hand.  Way better than spending a ton to take it the fix it shop!
B006570MAU|3|Great quality and looks, but the windscreen assembly sits too far forward, which creates excessive buffeting to the helmet/head at &#62;40mph.
B00LM5RH9E|5|Perfect fit and came super fast!!!
B00AC6Y7HE|5|BAG WORKED PERFECTLY
B004ADUK6C|5|Super
B00H9KVDYG|5|As expected, these do a good job.
B000A8JLIY|5|Fits RR as described.  Highly recommend the magnetic socket.  Will be very difficult (if not impossible) to pull out the spark plugs without the Gearwrench 80546 swivel socket.
B0009IQZFM|2|Hard to get dirt/ debris off for multiple uses. Does the job the first time.
B004HNT4WQ|5|I like the bright yellow because it stands out thru the windshield really well. If they want my truck with this they will have to work for it.
B00ECGWRHC|4|Fits right in with the bike style. Easy to see and read. Simple to install.
B0013IR88A|5|Took this on a recent week long road trip, and it saved us a small fortune. It is not very big, but could hold enough to feed our family a meal. Before our trip, I cooked up large batches of food, and froze it in one meal sized containers, and packed them in a cooler. During the trip, we would start the slow cooker about 1 to 1.5 hours before we wanted to eat (this was for precooked, mostly thawed food), used a slow cooker liner and lined the lid with foil so there was zero clean  up. I did put a hot pad under the cooker as it seems to get pretty hot, and also as others have noted, do not run it unless the vehicle is running so you don't drain the battery of your vehicle. This slow cooker will become our next staple for future vacations, and short day trips.
B004669R4Y|3|Was ok for a temporary fix.
B000AM8BF4|5|Works very well, thanks
B00HEDJ7OG|4|Awesome upgrade from my stock 7.3 Tranny cooler.  Took a little while to install, but this has really dropped my tranny temps considerably!  Needed a few things to complete the install.  Needed washers for the bottom mounts, few feet of 1/2 hose, and 3/8 to 1/2 hose barbs to convert from stock tranny lines to the larger lines on this cooler.   Would give 5 stars, but I haven't seen the reliability of it yet (heard that Dorman products don't last real long, so time will tell).  So far I highly recommend it.
B004QOK1VY|5|Received the product and i'm very satisfied with this item.
B00OSL43VO|3|dificil de instalar
B000J2JED8|3|Good lite bulb
B00EW0EJ9C|4|muy buenos
B00YV4HBTY|5|Worked as advertised! I paid $4.50 to get the keys cut and the programming instructions you're flawless! A great buy and now I have extra keys for my F 150.
B00RUE11PM|3|Look great but slip on highway bar under pressure.
B00507PLGG|5|Just as described and pictured good quality.
B00DQUT6E2|5|Excelent
B00DNJPYO2|5|The cover fit my 50cc toatoa scooter perfectly. There are holes designed in the bottom middle of the cover for a bungee to be used, however the design also has a nice elastic around the bottom that holds the cover snug around the bottom. Folds well. Seems to be good quality. Holds up nicely to rain.Customer service repress prompt and is helpful. 
B00AZABHLQ|5|Great selection of adaptors - I already had 2 sets of different brand name but lost some pieces. this set fit the bill for Toyota solara
B00WGZJ7VU|5|Nicer or the money.  Only thing is you have to plug their plug in the factory plug.
B00DCULNXS|5|Works to stop the hyper flashing of the 1157 LED turn signal bulbs I installed on my suv.
B00NLULY9M|5|So Bright Stevie Wonder can see them...
B001QVFALG|1|Does not last, non pro grade stuff.
B00SIOWX2S|5|Great Price Fast Delivery
B000YC9FTQ|4|Good product
B00UHD4HJA|3|I should've figured they only showed the popular stickers in the photos. I got a good deal of Spongebob, Hello Kitty, and obscure anime characters. Got about 10 that were any good. Nice quality stickers though.
B002PQSC4I|5|They were nice the only problem rubber gasket was to thick made it hard to install had to cut down the rubber gasket and still the light is not flush to the car but fast delivery and great price
B00PP6ORAS|4|I would give it 5 stars but there were two parameters in which these emblems dissatisfied me. 1) The seller claims that the emblems measure 5.3 x 3 inches, this is not true because they measure the same size as the &#34;CAMARO&#34; fender letter emblems. 2) The adhesive backing is very cheap and it came off easily, so I had to improvise by cutting tiny strips of 3M automotive adhesive. Other than these two flaws, the emblems were made of some kind of metal, and not cheap plastic and were painted nicely. I know these come from China and the fact that it took almost a month to arrive was not an issue, after all I did pay like $12.00.
B0055XHBHC|5|Last weekend I vowed that I wouldn't spend another weekend on our crappy rv mattress it is only 2 years old and is now on the burn pile! After some deliberation and review reading I settled on this mattress. If you're looking for one here is our take on it. It was only 219.00 which I feel is a great price for a rv mattress. We felt it was a little too firm...just a smidge, so we're going to put our foam mattress pad on it. Thanks to someones review i knew to open it inside the bedroom of the RV. So it opened right up. We put it in on Thursday evening and slept on it friday night. No smells as other reviewers had absolutely none. All in all pretty happy with our purchase! The shipping was lightening fast! Ordered it monday got it Friday
B00BODWSKC|5|A+++++
B003YNGYYQ|5|Perfect fit for my 2010 Cadillac STS
B00MOWEFVC|4|Fit my tundra great, it was interesting that it was mirrored on both sides so could be used as replacement for both drivers or passenger side mirrors.  Not compatible with defrost mirrors but I just eliminated that feature by cutting the wires.  Would have been nice to keep it but for the savings of going with this product it could not be beat!
B00A2DW4ZE|5|This cover offers great protection for the entire vehicle. it has a good fit and it is easy to take on and off. The material also seems to be of good quality, so I am hoping it will last for a few years.
B00S5P6LF0|4|As promised
B00KL3ALGO|4|Does the job well enough. Doesn't cover as much window nor give as much a shade as I like, but better than having bare windows. What I like most is the static cling. So effective. I'm tired of suction cups that break after a while.
B0039HD4RM|5|Very good purchase!!!
B007IVS4Z2|5|Arrived on time. Packaged well. Fit perfectly.
B00EA0ZB7I|5|These lights are amazingly bright for the price. I installed these on my 08 impala. They are installed behind my bottom grille. It's lights up the whole road with my 6k hid headlights and fogs. Now let's see how long they last...I have no moisture issue at the moment. I did reseal it to make sure I won't ever have that issue. Overall it's a great product for the price. Hope it will last awhile
B00P5YO1BU|1|These caps DO NOT FIT MOST CARS. If your mercedes is newer than 2001, these are too small...They do not tell you this when you purchase them.
B000X1E59S|5|The oil was what I needed at the cost.
B00HVON60Y|2|This is for 1 (one) filter, when you need 2 for a full replacement.  Other brands and sellers provide pairs of filters for the same price, making this double the cost it deserves to be.
B00OFEBD5I|2|The pre-cut measurements were bad, I recommend one that is better cut to the factory measurements.
B008DEYA24|5|Custom fit barrier to hav underbody last longer with better appearance
B00JRE6APE|3|Does what it is intended. Tolerances are pretty loose in the lock mechanism, which makes it a little cumbersome to use at times, but it isn't bad.
B00RY7ZMBY|5|It looks amazing just what I wanted.
B000CF6S2W|5|Looks good on the frontier (2015). Remove remove the tape after you insert it in the Channel.
B00CU4Q3DW|5|Perfect
B0016C3STQ|4|very  good kit
B00E9FXXBA|1|This is a scam. DO NOT BUY!!!!!!
B00M6TX5NW|1|I bought this product in december 2014, now the lights are good, but no have color any more, they are jus white! :(
B000C92YZS|1|Received a set from amazon, installed and couldn't figure out why it was so tight with all new hardware, drum, wheel cylinder and even all new brake lines from the proportioning valve all the way around.. Swapped them out for some from O'Reillys after 4 attempts to rebuild the one side that was not lining up right. Turns out the brake shoe itself was warped, causing rubbing on 1 side. I will never order brakes from amazon again
B004SRRTPK|5|works perfect
B000182DSS|5|Worked great on 71 Charger with a stock flat hood. I did pop-rivet them in 4 places to pull them down flat.<br />Also cut out the scoop opening and epoxied the supplied vented insert on the opening.<br />Cut two large holes in hood, inside the scoops. Works and looks great!  Big Block also runs cooler!<br />Note: I would only do this to a cheap stock hood.
B004A6I1OM|5|perfect part and service
B00480J4KA|5|Product as expected.
B004RCV0OM|5|Received within 3 days and got the job done
B0024NSWHY|5|I'm in love with these headlights!! Arrived earlier than the delivery date and they fit just perfect. My car looks brand new.
B00Z29FEPK|5|was ordered as a gift, it shipped very quickly and arrived in perfect condition.  Item is even better than described.  Thank you!
B00J4UQNCG|4|Nice part, works as described.
B003BXV3EU|5|fit great
B00UXZY0R6|2|Key fell apart when being keyed, had to buy another from the locksmith. Remote works great.
B00852684M|5|very cool way to protect kids on bikes at night!
B0046MVWPU|5|Works great!!!
B000SL0R9K|5|Hopefully I'll never have to use it, but it clips onto the inside of the Car so if we flip or something it won't move. Having flipped a car I can appreciate it.
B002BQN62A|4|keeps my hands warm in spring what I was looking for
B00IKKS4W8|5|The bolt pattern was a little different, but I had room to drill one new hole and the mount bolts were self tapping.Support was good and that is what I was looking for.
B0001EFSTI|4|A great multitool!  I bought it for the random times I need a bottle opener, but I found that I use it all the time!<br /><br />Added bonus: I barely notice that I have it, since it's the shape and weight of a large key.
B002KR63IO|5|This is the great oil. My 2-stroke scooter starts better and runs cleaner. I recommend this seller also. The price was good for this product which is normally quite expensive, and the shipping was fast.
B001Q24UIY|4|These seat covers fit my 2004 Scion xa seats very well.<br />Fairly easy to put on, and look good...but I had assumed they were more of a mesh construction, rather than the short faux fur style that they are.<br />I'm not a big fan of the fur (possibly extra hot/sweaty during hot weather), and the print is so vivid, it looks very fun...kitschy...tacky, in (to me) a fun way.<br />If you are looking for something sedate or serious, these are not for you.<br />If you enjoy kitsch, you will like these.<br />For the cost ($8 for 2 covers) this is a phenomenal value.
B00HE0K9LO|5|This is my second Carflector. My wife liked the one on my new truck so well she wanted one on her Rav4 also. Several comments about how unique the vehicle looks now. Really easy to install. The second one took about 15 minutes. Less bug hits on the windshield too.
B005WXDPHK|5|This is really good cover.  It protects my vehicle from the sun and keeps it dry when it rains.  Works very well.
B004VFJM68|5|Arrived on time and in perfect shape. Mounted easily on our 2005 Jeep Liberty. We put a large Thule car topper on them and had it loaded with camping gear. Didn't notice any wind noise while driving. Great product and would certainly recommend to others.
B00XDNMETG|4|Great product. Everything to put license plate was included. Very sturdy. Swould recommend spraying with a clear coat so all jewels stay in place.
B00XR36WVI|4|Given as a gift. Arrived in good condition.
B0002L6VDM|5|Shade arrived on-time and fits my windshield perfectly. It is easy to put in place and remove.
B00252AJY8|5|just what we wanted
B006WP6QM8|4|good product for good price. it came with a single scratch at the top but its not a big deal. other than that great product.
B000CC0HZ4|5|THIS WAS FOR MY WIFES VEHICLE AND IT WORKS GREAT
B000COSB14|5|Bought a pair for my wifes truck they installed very easy and work great
B00E3W7L6M|4|Great products. These look great and make the cup-holders look much better. The only problem I have with them is the tape they came with. It does not stick at all and the pieces spin at the bottom of the cup-holders. I would still recommend this product.
B0058DIAPG|5|Love it!!!!!! Makes my RAM tires more shiny
B008YAVIOK|4|Does not feel as secure as the elbow guards design.
B00Y75QZD0|5|This Smart Charger does it all!  It is the perfect charger for my husband who drives a cab.  He can charge his phone, tablet and GPS all at the same time!  Being on the go all day long for 12 or more hours, he has to charge his electronic devices often.  This makes it so easy for him, no rotating devices, they can all be plugged in at the same time.  What's really great is the safety feature that won't overcharge and ruin the battery.  For this price and with a one year warranty you really can't go wrong with this charger.  This is a must have in today's electronic dependent world!<br /><br />I received this product for free in exchange for my honest, unbiased review.  This in no way has influenced the rating I've given this product.
B00W9Z3NLW|5|The sticker seems very strong. It's a great design on my car and pops out. I love it! Great fan of the movie!
B000EDOTCS|5|Great product.  I bought this for my RV.  It's nice to be able to pull the paper towels off, with the handle, if I need to.
B0051V7AXS|5|i buy this battery for the brand gave me confidence , and I used to helmets and liked it , so , I decided to buy for the first time a battery filled , until now it has worked perfectly , is a powerful battery, I hope I Throughout the period indicated by manufacturer .
B00XWDYSWS|5|SO glad I found this! I thought I was going to have to spend $200+ at the dealer to get a new fob. This was SO easy to program and it works perfectly!
B001G6EZZS|5|Exact same factory part that the BMW dealer would have charged me over $100 for. Great deal.
B001GMX9VS|5|meet my expectations
B00VB2DG66|5|While I don't see or smell any improvement in my SUV and it still smells like cigarette smoke and dog odors I'll upgrade my review to 5 stars to satisfy the seller/manufacturer. Most of the reviewers have rated it 5 stars so I have to assume this product works for most of them. I just don't see any improvement. lol
B00CFL8ZL8|5|Just what I was looking for. Exactly the right color and texture. Good price, fast ship.
B001N72FES|4|ok
B001IWLBPC|5|Fit my 2010 VW CC perfectly. Virtual replica to factory windshield wiper. Very happy with performance 1 month in.
B005GSFUWE|5|As advertised.
B002XM5G70|5|This replacement runs a lot quieter than my old shurflo.
B004A6MB4I|5|worked great.
B00029WR78|3|works so far
B000CITK8S|5|These are great for keeping lesser used batteries ready to rock and roll. I picked up additional attachments and leave them hooked up to the batteries so I can just hot swap from the quad to the motorcycle to the rzr.
B008AWDUN4|5|bolted right on and works great, cheaper and easier than a rebuild kit.
B004P5G2GM|1|Very unsteady and did not even fit in my 1998 Montero Sport.
B00CK8VO4G|5|Awesome shift knob not a cheap rattle ball like you get at autozone
B0041LN1L4|4|Fine product.
B004UI28AS|4|I was a little upset to see that the throttle tube came in a blue color and not the gray color that it shows in the picture.  It really stands out on my Honda since there is no other blue on the bike.  There isn't any warning in the listing that you may receive other colors than what is shown in the picture.  In the end, it functions pretty well and seems sturdy enough.  I'm not getting a great snap back, but that may be the cables and not the tube.
B0082ACB8E|5|Super product.<br />Love it.<br />Easy to install, works great!!
B0009OMYDS|5|Stiff bristles. Mine has been strong and durable.
B003MS6QHS|4|Had a cam lobe go flat on an older car without roller lifters. Hope this works to prevent a repeat since they removed this additive from oils recently.
B000FQ23JK|5|Accurate Description, Well Packed, Fast Delivery & Great Price
B000C55L0M|5|Great job.
B00HVVVEYM|5|Exactly what we needed.
B004J5KY5S|5|Worked great! Easy to install, and came with fuel lines AND fuel filter!  Go-cart starts up easy, and stays idling perfectly!
B004GCP2GA|5|It worked great and to put it on was easy
B00KPWYK68|5|Excellent customer service!!  It came in just a couple  a days and looks great. I would recommend this to anyone looking to  customize ther atv
B0039ZS2S0|4|Good article.
B008SEM724|5|satisfied
B00NTPSLZ4|5|Bright light and very slim I love it! Installed it and bought 2 more!
B0010GDWMQ|3|Ok, but it was too short for my car.
B000CIT3MG|5|Great!
B005MZX3YS|4|ok
B006QGD996|3|The 1&#34; Straps are really thin, and flexible which make them easy to knot up.  The buckets are made from very thin sheet metal, and one of the springs that operate the ratchet system didn't work right out of the box.  These Tie-downs are Harder to dis-engage (Release) the ratchet compared to my more expensive ones.  Do they work?  Yes.  Would I trust them holding a heavy load?  No, mostly due to the ratchet mechanism
B006ACYXTQ|4|Works well. Easy to self install at home.
B0002MA4WK|5|Good product, accurately described by seller.
B009PIIPHI|5|fit great made for my car.
B005KDO9C2|5|Very bright compared to the old oem headlight bulbs
B007PMY3MM|5|great item to buy with great shipping.
B002MGYWI6|5|Quality protection. Always use in all my vehicles, gives me piece of mind knowing that the engine is protected.
B00ECKI4WA|5|works great, and I'm glad to use something more natural than most commercial hand cleaners
B009M1VO6C|3|The lights are pretty cool at night they aren't that bright as the picture above but they're a little bright and blue .
B00PXU8FVI|5|just what I needed
B00SLLDGK6|5|Drop in fit. Not very hard to install.
B0009WK9OG|5|The spark plug Wires  were exceptional good, and the price was fair. This is a good company to do business with
B00W6KYJ9U|5|Made with good  quality material. Fit perfect
B000I5EQ2K|5|Great sound, great look!!
B000KEFJZM|4|Leaks
B00MQNNB3C|5|excellent
B0000AY4YT|5|Exactly as described. Fast Shipping. Thank you!
B001DKP2H2|5|Awesome tool, works very well, and is much better than the plastic alternatives!
B00APOAN9Y|5|These were high quality and were packaged to avoid shipping damage  - Nice !!!!
B00E203PEW|4|The instructions can be a little confusing when you have three to look at.  I installed mine thru YouTube.  Trust me!  It's a lot more understanding when you have someone telling you and showing you step by step.  I installed it on my own so it took me longer.  But overall I'm really happy with the product.  I give 1 thumbs up.
B005SUYPB2|5|Great value, quality product.  Good fitment, no leaks.
B00B5L5QJ8|5|Best chip you can buy, BUT you must send it to a reputable tuning company to put tried and true custom tunes on this chip! This is a must. The generic tunes that come with this are not going to shift good. You NEED at least a pyrometer gauge to monitor exhaust gas temp when towing or blasting around unloaded or you can burn a hole in a piston, 1250 degrees is the max. There's a reason why you feel such an increase in power, ford doesn't want you to grenade your engine so they back the fuel away and back timing off so the truck is a slug. A safe slug. I say this but I have 230k chipped and it is a very reliable vehicle. I've seen 7.3s still running fine with 700k miles and chipped their whole lives. It's all a matter how you treat the truck. Get a pyrometer gauge before installing this or don't go blasting around until you do.
B00JW0FNQU|5|it was good as expected
B005G1COW0|5|Great helmets and vendor service
B000SL4AA2|4|seems to work well.
B002Q2T8R6|5|I used this to keep my range hood cool when its lights are on.  Worked very well
B00OSL4RFG|1|After reading reviews on other products I'm afraid just bc Amazon says it fits doesn't necessarily mean that it does. Does this set of seat covers fit 2015 GMC Acadia?
B001HATY36|4|Works as advertised. Used for my jetski trailer.
B00L3KXAG2|5|Fit very well
B00KTIVEP8|5|Easy to program, fast shipping!
B00VVQU2UK|4|Better than most!
B0027995VW|4|GOOD
B000C9DGMI|1|The condenser I received was so warped it should never have passed the manufacturing facilities inspection process and instead should have gone directly to the recycle bin. As soon as I received it I sent it back for a refund. Rarely have I been disappointed with AC Delco repair parts. Now I've got to start over and find a quality condenser that will fit my old Chevy truck !
B0029V9DRY|1|Terrible, the product straps broke off 2hrs into the road trip, we ALMOST lost our luggage on the way to vegas but I the noise got louder and so we had to wait till we got to a safe place to pull over which was a while more and find out the straps had ripped off and the bag open.
B00LW834Z2|5|Lots cheaper than going to the ford dealership. Ace hardware cut the teeth from my original key for $1.
B009Z0RAH2|5|Thanks!
B000CIAW8K|5|Have had the clutch installed for about a month. Seems to be working great and i liked the fact that this came with everything for a great price.
B001S80ZV2|5|Worked perfectly!
B000BPWSJU|4|Am pleased with this item not yet installed.
B00JMXQKWS|5|Good packaging, fit perfectly. But needed a car place to install it because I couldn't get the original light out.
B00NEL6HK4|5|Works great so far, been about 4 months and air quality is still great.
B009G58A6G|1|Looks good, but cheap plastic, you don't get the quality for the amount of money you paid.
B008FRFC8U|5|Works great
B011U9GGDO|5|keep it as a spare for my moped
B00FSAV5LU|5|worked very well- easy to use
B001TLWJIA|5|Loved them made my trucking job much easier
B0101U6OVW|5|just as described.
B00IBJCJ7O|5|Fit as stated.
B00AVUF7YS|2|one of the handle bar covers was little more than half as thick as the other one.
B000I32N7C|1|These letters are complete trash, not raised like stock dash letters they are completely flat like paper thin and the adhesive hardly sticks. I prepped the area properly and they still wouldn't stick, tried a little heat still nothing. Don't buy these, it will cost me more in gas, shipping and inconvenience just to send them back for a refund.
B0052XHR7O|4|Happy about the price advanced auto has it listed for twice as much
B00O9G9CKA|5|This molding fit perfectly on my son's car and looks great.  We did need to paint it and have it professionally installed as the advertisement counseled but we painted with spray can paint and it matched very well.
B000C7U362|1|Does not last, non pro grade stuff.
B00KWLKTDU|5|Good it came on time
B000F0QYCS|5|Fits good, looks good. Add extra velcro if you want it to fit good.
B0087EN2NI|5|Veerrrry nice
B0081KM6Q2|3|Cheap made
B00YDNWF7G|5|The best helmet hands down I've ever worn
B0027URE1O|4|fits like it should.  Hard to bolt the winch in.
B002FS5EL0|2|SQUEKS. No noise over bumps, but squeks when turning.
B00CLTXPX2|5|I use this stuff on everything. Works very well and last for a decent amount of time
B00PF0HII2|5|I was surprised one LED headlight burned out after 7 months of normal usage however Sason from Customer Service quickly responded to my email & I immediately received the replacement within 2 days. On my vehicle this automatically lights up as DRL but they are also the main headlight so no issues there. My only real complaint with this product is the high pitched whining noise from the cooling fan when in use otherwise I'm very pleased with improved visibility & brightness from these. My experience with Customer service has been GREAT!!. Thanks again!!
B00FSFKXTA|5|This is a Rein hose. CRP is the parent company for Rein. Installed on '07 BMW 525xi and it fit perfectly.
B00CQC8N54|5|Thank you
B002300KM8|5|Worked perfect for a Kawasaki Concours 14
B000RN4FK6|5|Nice for the price...
B004GCNIZ2|1|Doesn't fit the 2000 Pontiac Sunfire that I bought it for. When I checked on here it said it was compatible.
B000KL37AY|5|Weather tech is always high quality.  Bought a set for my other car, I highly recommend if you have kids or do stuff in the dirt, it'll keep your carpets clean.
B00BAQ1L6A|5|Excellent
B000BUQOAE|2|The opening is so small it would take you forever to get water through it.
B007MHKP4A|5|lovee lovee loveee ! goes beautiful on the back window of my car &#60;3
B008BLKI2U|5|Really like then had to buy another one to put on my rear tail lights but they are not so dark as the pic from the top  but dark enough  so im happy with them thank you
B00G0P0I60|5|Fit perfect. Easy install. Original rotted after 8 years. Glad to find a replacement so easy and cheap.
B00199F2WW|4|Works well. no issues.
B00AYXM4DY|5|This stuff is awesome.  Worked well with renewing the plastic on our Avalanche. Wish came in larger container. Have to use sparingly
B00HQZAYC6|5|fast shipping and wipes well
B000NWA50U|4|good fit great
B0002Z9R0C|1|not the right one for a 2002 rx300
B004GFS2C8|5|Works as advertised
B004LWVEKS|2|I've been using this for over a year now and can honestly say that I can see no difference between this a $25 unit you get a Walmart with the same amperage rating. I have also noted that a few batteries that were discharged could not be brought back by this charger but were charged fine by my old Deltrans battery tender or a cheap Schneider charger. The packaging is nice I guess but the performance is not so great. I have also watched some videos of professionals take these apart and note that the internals are not at all premium. I would not buy another one.
B00HNL7SB8|5|Too small but looks good
B005GYATVU|5|I absolutely love this shade!  It fits perfectly in my car and keeps the interior cool.  I live in a very warm environment and worry not only about internal temperature but also about aging of my interior from the hot sun.  This is by far the best sun shade I have tried.
B00XAU6ML8|1|Don't waste your money, it will not fit. The thread is smaller than the OEM tow hook so it will not fit! I have a 2015 sti
B00CF2QJCE|4|This product is what my canoe cracks was looking for. The product that I used last year was ok but by the middle of summer the cracks had to be resealed. So far this year I haven't had to redo the canoe!!
B000L9AD2K|5|use this to pump my bikes up. works very well. would buy again
B0042VVKGG|4|hope i never have to use it
B00I5058AY|4|Great quality, easy install with the supplied instructions, would buy from seller again
B011Q18D14|4|Straight and to the point.  It doesn't have all the gadgets and functionality of some others that I've seen.  But for the price, it's better for me, and more suited for a non-mechanic like me.  I just need to know what's wrong with my truck before the auto shop does so I'll know if I'm being scammed.  This works for me.
B002E2L1KU|5|Fast shipping and good price!  Perfect fit. Watch youtube video first for easy install.
B003ENG3M4|3|We are still missing two end caps on  this item!
B0095Z6IG6|5|I'm wholly satisfied with my purchase of these inner tubes. They were exactly as described (complete with valve caps), carefully packaged, promptly shipped, and easy to install. I inflated them almost two weeks ago, and there's no sign of leakage. So, they hold air!
B000WJC9XK|5|looks good on the bike
B000NVW1LM|1|I hoped this product would stop a rear seal leak in my transfer case to rear drive shaft. Unfortunately it didn't slow down the leak so I replaced the seal on my 2001 Jeep Wrangler.
B00VHUCR12|5|Loved it, product as advertised
B00HJCX05O|5|These rails were easy to install, but the instructions that come with the rails leave a lot to be desired! (Thank you to the reviewer who posted more detailed instructions. Print the instructions out and refer to them when you do the installation!) It took me about 30 minutes to install the rails by myself, but I was very thorough to make sure I did it right. I also was very careful to cover the car with drop cloths so as not to scratch or ding the finish. The rails look great, and give the Highlander more of a &#34;SUV&#34; look. There is a little increase in wind noise coming from the rails at highway speeds, especially over 70 mph, but it isn't too bad. I haven't attached my kayak rack or bicycle rack yet, but those will be a lot noisier than these rails by themselves. My Thule kayak rack will attach easily to these &#34;aero kit&#34; style roof rails, but I might have to replace the bike rack, which is designed to fit a square crossbar-style rack.
B000LPYSCK|5|Have had it for quite some time and it still works great keeping things organized.
B00CMX3JUQ|4|It fits very well in my 2015 Forester, and does a good job of blocking out the heat of a sunny day. for the price, it's a good deal.
B00DZJYL9E|5|Very bright and well constructed.  The materials used are definitely resistant to weather and look like they'll last a long time.
B00E5Y2ZM8|5|A+ Item and seller
B008Z8W5XY|5|I use this ashtray on my pontoon boat.  I like it because I can secure my lit cigar when attending to other things on my boat and it fits perfectly in my cup holders.  When I do, or don't, finish a cigar, I can put it in the can and close the lid to either dispose of it later or re-light it when need be.  They make great gifts for cigar smoking friends, too.
B00DX8BYIS|1|It's not mirror it's a dark smoke visor. I was not satisfied with this option.
B003S25WQ4|5|Well made heavy fabric, these car seat covers are exactly as shown in the photo. They are well worth the money, as they will last for many years to come. They've been on my seats for 4 months & still look brand new.
B004OJPSLE|5|part fit like a glove great price
B007VR6806|5|Just what I needed
B00SFKMN8O|5|The space between my seat and the center console is very narrow, food and small items would often find their way into the crevices and would prove extremely difficult to remove.  These things are amazing, I no longer have that problem.  I picked up a pair in black.
B01196JAI6|5|I bought this trash bag for my new Cadillac that my husband bought me for Christmas.
B004OK77L2|1|this jack was used worked one time and stoped working it was missing parts the only good thing about it was they returned it good and gave my money back
B00VB2OILS|5|So far it is everything it said it would be.  I measured my car at 192&#34; and the extra large fit perfect.  It's soft and lightweight and protects my car from the elements. It hasn't rained yet but I'm sure it will keep it dry as I have read good reviews. Good product for the value.
B000XBCURW|2|Works great but it washes of in the first rain.
B00UZA635G|5|Works perfect! We have needed these for a while were thrilled to have extra keys and fobs. Arrived on time and as described
B00KGGTF9U|4|It is big enough and fits my 2015 Subaru Forester great. It takes up the whole windshield and blocks the sun.<br />After receiving it and opening it, it fells pretty flimsy/cheap quality of fabric was my first thought, but it works great so far. I will just have to wait and see how long it holds up in the Texas sun over time. As long as it lasts several years I will be happy with it. I think a big benefit of it is that it does claps really well and does not take up any space when it is not in use.
B000OF7MMA|4|I love the look and function of this device and would have given it 5 stars if it actually was a fit for 1998-2004 Dodge Intrepids, as it claims to. The thermometer likely will not be accurate on anything if it does not have a direct fit to radiator. The radiator cap sits on the reservoir, not the radiator and the copper temp of this product never makes director contact with coolant unless it boils over.
B002935IV2|5|Our family took a week-long trip to Tennessee, which was 10 hours away.  With 8 of us going in two vehicles, we needed a way to pack a large amount of luggage & baby items.  We managed to pack all suitcases, strollers, a baby walker & pack-and-play in the Rightline Gear Bag.  It worked like a charm! It stayed dry, good quality, never slipped or moved the entire time.  Excellent product! Will use this again and again.  Highly recommend!  Be sure to pack it as FULL as possible.
B0071MFPUU|1|I bought a full set of Sensen struts and strut mounts from another vendor (initials RA). They are the worst parts I have ever put on a car. I replaced the struts and mounts on my 1999 Toyota Avalon because they were noisy; the replacement Sensen parts made MORE NOISE than the original parts within TWO DAYS of installation. These aren't even good enough to put on a car you are going to sell immediately.<br /><br />The Sensen parts have a lifetime warranty, but the warranty is only valid for replacement with the same low quality part. Don't bother.
B00K6B1JOY|1|Cost a lot of money and didn't work  kept making flashing clicking sound all the time even when the truck was off and the key was out. Bought another thought it was a bad one. The second one did the same thing. Save you money and put in the registers  these flashers DIDNT work.
B00NAUKQ0Q|4|These work great. The wiring pigtails are plenty long enough. I only used 4 of them. Stepped on one and it didn't break, so the plastic is better than my klutz self deserves.
B00FALVU8A|3|While I liked the ease of use, after a couple of storms, my car was spotted all over with water spots. I hosed it off, and while it looked better, still spotty. I didn't have this problem with Mother's carnauba wax in past uses. I will add that it left my car with a deep shine. I am going to revolt my car the next chance I have, to see if that will clear up the issues I'm having. If it does, I'll update my review.
B000EQ8Y2Q|5|Perfect fit!
B008HT78BU|5|Excellent
B005PZMKZI|4|Helps protect the leather seats for any more wear & tear damage
B00514B03Q|5|Fit perfect..  Lots of adjustment..  I like it LOTS!  Now I do wish it would of been less expensive but you get what you pay for..
B004UOE8XC|3|Loos
B00JD96XDM|5|Beautiful in the Silver....
B007TG7HFY|1|This product is advertised to fit a 2012 GMC Terrain.  It does not! This is for the rear wiper and there is a cover that will not fit over this blade
B00T8HPF24|5|The best bulbs I've purchased so far , very easy installation, extremely bright. I've used these as fog light bulbs and they're brighter then the stock projectors that the car came with. Word of advice to any new installation don't cut or splice OEM connectors because they won't work. Made that mistake installing them on my honda which I had to splice HIDs in. Anyways long story short I spliced back in the OEM connectors and they weren't agreeing with the LEDs so I've used the LEDs as fog lights now. Amazing product , amazing company, looking forward to do business again in the future!
B000NVW1LM|4|Seems to work well
B004A6JA2O|5|After almost 3 years of owning my Prius, I started getting a funky, moldy smell in my car when the A/C turned on.  I googled it and people said the smell went away when they changed their cabin air filter.  I had also had my oil changed at the dealership recently, and they wanted to change my engine air filter and cabin air filer.  I didn't change it there because it was really expensive with the dealership.  So I ordered the filters on Amazon.  Changing them was really easy.  I did watch a YouTube video on how to change the cabin air filter, but it was not hard.  When I started the car and turned the A/C on ... the smell was gone!!!<br /><br />When my husband complained of the same funny smell in his car when the A/C turned on, we ordered him a new cabin air filter too.
B0072MYW2G|5|Perfect fit and fast shipping
B000NBVFN2|5|really helped in R&R of my spark plugs, did not break one single spark plug (although I have read reviews where most have said they break them anyway)...highly recommended.
B00CJUW3HW|5|Love this Sticker. Exactly as describe and arrived quickly.
B004F8LU8E|5|Perfect fit for 2015 Mini Cooper
B009PJJI8M|5|Matched the original dipstick for 2002 Jetta sedan with standard 4 cyl gas engine. Original plastic handle weakened and broke after 12+ years. This one only has to match that to be a lifetime replacement.
B008FLSY0Y|5|First time a little difficult figuring out and getting to fit -- but looks nice and very pleased with it.  I bought this to put on the front of my Fiat instead of having a &#34;rock guard&#34; on the back of my RV -- seems to do the job just fine.
B00267PZUK|5|aok
B000BPR13I|5|Outstanding product. Fits well
B003RQBKLC|4|I've had mine almost a week and it interferes horribly with my XM Onyx, which plugs into one of the 12V sockets.  The audio is unlistenable as it is muddy with a lot of fuzz.  If I plug straight into my car's socket the radio works fine, so it is most definitely this unit.  I would give it 1 star but other than the audio issues it appears to charge fine and power other units connected to the 12V... just don't use it for an audio device.  *** I've upgraded to 4 stars at the problem has subsided for now.
B00D8BFJP4|5|Looks great on my gun safe.
B0002NYDYY|5|Easy to use at a low price
B00G3DCQVE|1|Went through three of these. None lasted more than 30 days. They were good about the 30-day warranty, but save yourself the headache.
B004I12424|5|Perfect replacement part. Seems to be high quality, and a perfect fit on my 2005 T&C Van
B00O1QUUKY|5|Great product. I was my car a lot and this product has been great when it comes to drying it before I apply wax.
B00BVPTNBK|5|The part is excellent but unfortunately it said that this part would work on my vehicle and it did not. Had to return and get a different part number. The seller is very cooperative in the return.
B00CT2Z2DC|4|Fit perfect, the quality felt a bit less than standard though. i hope it holds up to normal use.
B006WQSZW6|5|There's nothing like ACDelco a fit like a glove it works great
B003ZWHLCU|4|The part is perfect, EXCEPT that it does not come with the bolts that are needed to complete the installation (bolts included would have raised my rating to 5 stars). See the other comments, and watch a video on YouTube to see how to get the job done. It took me and a partner about 2 hrs (not counting the time it took to get the bolts!).
B001FQOGFS|5|This item is well-constructed and was easy to install in place of a failed unit from a different manufacturer. It worked as expected from the get-go; the application was a class &#34;A&#34; RV with two battery banks and the result is that both banks charge as originally designed using a &#34;smart&#34; charger/converter in addition to the engine alternator. A nice item at a good price, super-fast shipping as well.
B002GO781C|5|Works great fit a 2003 Dodge Grancaravan
B00HFWYZO8|4|Fit well and the back mat is nice and wide for my Ford Expedition.  Seem very durable.
B000F5LJ7S|5|Works great on a 2007 Nissan Sentra, equivalent to tool part Kent-Moore #J-45722 ($120-150). Always a good idea to grease up the lock ring for ease of removing and reinstalling it. Luckily, there was an access port to the fuel pump assembly through the back seat, so that I didn't have to drop the tank. I did try the hammer and screw driver method but couldn't get enough lateral force to pop the ring off, the angle was steep enough. A good idea to disconnect the battery. Remember to wrap up the fuel line, a clean latex glove works. And, thoroughly clean and dry the areas around the fuel pump to reduce the risk of debris falling into gas tank.<br />With OTC brand you'll always know that you're getting a excellent quality product - very sturdy. Pretty good price, since all of the auto parts shop wanted to charge around $75-80 (on special order tool); and I am not an auto mechanic by trade.
B00HE0K9LO|4|The shield came with directions for the incorrect vehicle.  Once I found the proper instructions online the instillation was very simple.
B00269RUUQ|5|Worked great as a uv protectant clear coat for my paddle board. Make sure you wear a respirator when applying. Heated up in a bucket of warm water for 5 minutes before applying.
B00USXNX9E|1|This item showed up broken with no return information
B0016KG72I|5|meet my expectations
B00FADJ0T4|5|Fits perfectly. Quick to install. Works just fine.
B00480J4UK|5|Yes they did
B008B5UUZG|5|Worked perfectly. Arrived timely.
B0085KGOH0|5|The towing bracket does come with this item...
B00K722PK4|5|I received these pretty fast and they mounted right up-- no trouble and very sturdy
B00FY813OU|1|Not quite the same length as the factory. Tolerances loose. Made for trouble keeping cable in place after a few days.
B00KZD8HNE|5|great item to buy with great shipping.
B00CDAFT6K|2|The ones that have suction cups at both top and bottom are much better.  I gave these away.
B004Y9ZZEE|5|great item to buy with great shipping.
B000CB57ZA|5|worked 100%. fit perfectly. Great quality
B00E0SG2MS|5|K&N make great products.
B00C5TN5OW|1|Not even close to what i would have liked for a fit? &#34; 1 size fits all &#34; my ass
B00KCXMCTM|5|great item to buy with great shipping.
B00HZTDKZG|5|This unit really does the job and I do like the led indicator lights that let you know if the unit is charging and when it is done.  I have used this to maintain batteries on equipment which has long intervals between use and it has never failed to keep the batteries ready to go.  This is particularly true in colder weather.
B000BGJWA2|5|I had to replace my RV plug and then found it would not fit inside my camper. So I got this to replace what I had and it worked. I didn't even have to cut a larger hole in my camper as the one there was already large enough.  Looks like OEM.  Camco 55283 30 AMP Mini Replacement Male Plug with PowerGrip Handle fits inside.
B00SH1SN6C|5|Purchased this last week and took it with me camping over the weekend. I was out walking my dog and passed another camper who was getting a jump start from another vehicle. I said &#34;if you need another jump start this weekend, let me know, I've got a new gizmo I'd like to try out&#34;. He said, &#34;Can you bring it over now, this other car doesn't seem powerful enough to jump start my car&#34;. I responded, &#34;Well, if your battery is that dead, my gizmo probably won't work either, but let's give it a try&#34;. He told me how he had left the radio on all night and the battery was so dead that even the lights on the dash wouldn't go on. I went back to my campsite, got my RAVPower kit, and hooked it up to his battery. He turned the key and whamo!, his car started immediately... when he turned it over it sounded like he had a full battery! I thought to myself &#34;that must have sucked the juice right out of my RAVPower&#34;..... but I checked and it still had four bars (full charge)! Amazing product!
B0067UBU8I|5|Fit my 2004 Subaru Outback wagon manual. Was a pain to install on the rust bucket of a car.
B00S0AIGNU|5|sweet
B000CPHXRG|5|works well
B007RHX1BO|5|Perfect
B00CO05BEY|5|The stitching was bad but the factory took care of it. ( well done )
B003DJLFRM|4|The unit appears to be well made.  It is slightly taller than the original and the foot lever is on the opposite side.  Also it only has 2 bolts vs the original 4 bolts.  We are adjusting.
B005OUVCLC|5|Works great
B007ZDGEZ0|1|This item came and it was plastic<br /><br />I was hoping for metal<br /><br />Paid $13 for 4 plastic caps
B000VBBQ10|2|Arrived twisted. I was able to mostly straighten it out. Recommend another brand.
B0066RWZQ8|3|While it was a perfect fit for my vehicle, the drain plug leaks as some others have mentioned.  I bought the new pan to fix a leak, and ended up with another one in the process... smh
B00H266JJQ|5|Easy install, cheap top and does the job.
B000BUQODG|3|Have only had for 1 year and lost 2 of them. Bolts pulled through the plastic cover. Needs to have a flat metal flange about 1/2&#34; wide by 4&#34; long to spread out the load when you tighten the nuts down.The single washer has just pulled through the plastic.
B00SVV84GC|5|Fit perfect fast shipping very happy
B00E5OUOCQ|5|this car shade is awesome.  It keeps out the heat, no more burning hands from the steering wheel.  I will be ordering another one for our other car soon.
B00FVZC624|5|Everything was good the gimbal bearing was very easy to install. The billows I would heat them to make it easier to make them stretch and flex. Other than that  their fine will material
B006573I2E|5|I love this kickstand!!!  I ride the desert where there is never a tree to lean the bike up against.  This folds up under the fender where it is completely out of the way.  It actually just looks like part of the bike when it is stowed away.  The foot is nice and broad to keep it from sinking into loose terrain.  Strong spring action and quality welds.
B0001MQ7E0|4|Spacious but heavy, and there is nothing to pull it with. My last one had wheels and a pull handle. As I said it's spacious, but once it's full its VERY heavy to carry being that the unit empty is considerably heavier than a regular cooler.
B0012BL8LG|1|every time I turn it on, the red light comes on, and it will not power up whatever I have plugged it it !!!  usually a portable tire inflator  !!!  I definitely would not buy another one !!I do not think it has enough power to convert the 12 volt stuff to 110 !!!
B009T4P1DE|5|Grip gets nice a toasty. I replaced my stock BMW grips for these. I use bars, so the only issues is if you have Pro Taper Pastrana bars you will have a hard time installing these. The grips are tight on the left side. Real tight. Took me an hour to install. I also have a G2 aluminum throttle and these grips will not fit at all. I had to take a Dremel and take material off the throttle. I installed same grips on my G/F's Honda F4 and had no issues. W
B000C2SBAM|5|Perfect fit for my 2001 Subaru Outback wagon.
B003RY53U8|5|Works as described. Expectations were met.
B005CLPOHG|4|Easy to install wirked great
B001A6CUB0|5|Perfect replacement for the ones I had, only needed one so replaced that one only, worked fine.  I did epoxy the grip on just in case of any future loosening issues.
B00A1X9IU4|5|Outstanding product!  I only buy OEM replacement parts for my 2008 Tacoma, and I'm thrilled I can find these oil filters (and other consumable items) on Amazon.  These are the correct filters for my truck, and the price is hard to beat.
B006EGAIII|4|Have not used but appears to be a quality made product .  Also , nice low ramp that should not hurt air foil on front of car !!   October 25    finally used ramp,,,,,,it is too low. The car is not high enough off ground.. Ramp need more height
B000C7Y6AG|5|Good
B002ESXIOQ|5|Works as advertised! Not a perfect match color wise.
B006QH6XQG|5|This battery is the best I have ever owned. Replaced one that I purchase in 2001. Old one still works but will not store a lot of power.
B00QTIAPMU|5|I purchased this cover for my husband's jeep wrangler about 3 months ago. I bought the medium size for his 16 inch tire. It took us a little &#34;tug&#34; to get it on, but once in place it fit great! At first the cover looked pretty wrinkled, but it smoothed out nicely after a few days. It really looks great and my husband loves it. The quality is also excellent for the price. I recommend this cover for any jeep owner. It's really nice, affordable, and looks really sharp on the back of the jeep. I give it 5 stars!!
B001KQ9L94|5|glad I went with the metal one and not the plastic! you can feel the difference
B006FDD74W|3|Didn't fit my car
B004JPSK2W|5|Arrived on time and packaged fairly well.  The pans fit with some work.  Still making some adjustments before completing the weld and painting.
B00SJ7KYJ8|4|They came faster than I was told, which is great.  They were easy to install, but they slide around as you get in and out of the car.  I expected they would hold in place a little better.  But it's better than the cracked leather seat!
B00VWC9P5Q|5|Good Product. Battery last long time
B004AU3HT2|4|Recommended.
B00CE3OQZ6|5|Cured my Mazda5 knocking sounds
B003VAXCWO|3|Clamps and secures the gate down, looks good.  I pretty sure anyone can use a wrench or something and steal the gate though.  What this turn key clamp will do is maybe stall the process
B00CT30SSU|5|Great price (as always) on the in-cabin air filter for my wife's 2015 Forester.  Dealer wanted $70 to change this thing out.  Took me 5 minutes to do my self.  Works and fits exactly like the OEM one that was in there.  Don't waste your money at the dealer or quick oil change place, do it yourself and save tons of $$$.
B00CPGQ2DG|5|I got this because I often times have to park on gravel and dirt, this is simply great to have.<br />Before I would carry around a piece of metal, but it was heavy and I felt like it would tear my seat.<br />It flexes a bit on gravel, but I think it will hold up well. Haven't tried on thick mud yet, I don't think It would do well against mud or sand.<br /><br />Definitely buy one if you live on gravel!
B00VAJWZD0|5|No complaints. Prompt delivery. Thank you.
B00XXLZ5T4|5|very soft and very light to use.
B002JATYOC|5|Quality for the price.
B007Y85U2E|5|Works great!!!
B003FCNX2C|2|I purchased these for my 2009 Mazda 3 in late June 2015. I was excited to receive them and the light from them is great. I very nice color.<br /><br />BUT....these are super dangerous for a Mazda 3!! After only 3 uses I noticed that my headlights would not come on sometimes?? I know how to install headlights properly so I knew that wasn't the problem.<br /><br />I pulled them out, checked the filament, and reinstalled and they came back on. This happened another 2 times within the first week of having them. The last time as I went to check I noticed a burnt plastic smell....the electrical type. As I went to pull them out my fingertips got burnt. The plastic bulb adapter was melting!!!<br /><br />Both sides were melted and I'm glad that my wiring wasn't or there was no fire!<br /><br />These are not safe. There should be a disclaimer stating that they are not suitable for use in a Mazda 3. If there is a disclaimer anywhere it is not clear.<br /><br />The seller tried to tell me that it was my fault and that I should have known to check the wattage that is acceptable for my vehicle. I have purchased higher watt light bulbs before with absolutely no problems.<br /><br />I will give respect to the seller as they refunded my money but would not pay for my replacement adapters that I had to go to the dealership to purchase because of their faulty or dangerous product.<br /><br />I highly recommend that you stay far away from this product if you own a Mazda 3 or possibly other vehicle.<br /><br />P.S. - I don't see a way to insert a picture for this review but if I discover how I will show the damage these caused.
B00GYCDZF0|5|Worked perfectly.
B0028QVM7E|4|Nice but alittle white against my black tank.
B007GHJ31W|5|Just a neat sticker if you like the band
B000C16XLC|5|Worked as advertised. I would purchase again.
B00E1SMC6C|4|good price fast shipping
B00L9NIFKO|3|Both pipes would not fit correctly so I ended up using only one if them. Makes a whistling sound in the higher RPM range and when I shift but it's good product overall, I could tell I got a little bit of improvement in my throttle response.
B007VXCYXA|5|Exactly what I wanted. Better look then the chrome oem. To me it gives the camaro a refreshing new look to keep it current with the newer cars.
B000GV8QAO|5|Put on my 1980 Yamaha SR250, works perfect.  Elevation 300.  So far stock main and pilot work fine, haven't gotten up 40+mph yet.  Using Emgo 60mm pod filter and Spectre Breather filter for the crankcase.
B006JRJVVC|5|This was easy to cut down to size.  I used my sewing machine to put a new binding on the top so it would last longer than a bare cut.  It cuts the light and heat better than anything on the market - so well that I don't have to pull my curtains across the front of the vehicle!
B005CWSBT8|5|Worked fine
B0091Q3NCG|5|Worked great for diagnosing a check engine light on my 1996 Saturn SL2.
B004C6OBBC|5|I purchased this hitch pin for two reasons: 1) The vinyl/rubber on the end of the handles, and 2) the &#34;key THROUGH pin&#34; design. It is used to hold a bike rack to our stock-tow package 2013 Ford Explorer, a job for which it works perfectly (check out my pics to see it in place). There is a bit of wiggle room available (less than .5&#34;) for the pin to slide side-to-side in the hitch, but this bit of play should not affect its purpose. You could always fit a series of rubber gaskets onto the pin to keep it from moving at all, if that was a concern.<br /><br />Before you purchase this, you'll need to look very closely at your hitch and make sure there is clearance for the handle end to sit at an angle appropriate for you to insert the pin. I read many reviews that mentioned this was a problem for some Toyota trucks.
B00BGYD6CS|5|Fits perfect.  Previous one lasted 3 years.
B00C5SS8CW|5|works great
B0002YUQ4E|5|😃
B00MBPLPOC|2|Product of the year? Wow, we have set our sites low. Carefully read the directions and applied to brand new tires on a brand new Lexus. Looked great the next day. Didn't drive for 72 hours so the product had a long time to &#34;harden&#34;. Drove around for a week and the tires completely lost their shine. Maybe this product is for older beat up tires. Certainly does not keep new tires looking new. A lot better products on the market. Try Meguiars tire gel - a lot better product.
B00ZBDZ67S|5|I received my emblems/badges within a week.  They are made of, what seems to be, the same stuff that comes from the factory for the 6.7 Powerstroke.  I'm not sure how they are constructed or made but they look amazing!  They came with the &#34;stickyback&#34; material on it already and they went onto my truck with ease and they are really on there.  The sticky material they used is super strong as I couldn't pull it off when i just tested it.  Very highly recommended if you want a way to dress up your 7.3L
B001KMO1JI|5|As described easy install fast shipping
B00H6ETIWY|4|ok Very good
B001892VAE|1|I never write reviews but this is a waste of money. The inner lining sheets were about as protective as a piece of tissue. They didn't fully cover the windows either. I felt like this was constructed by a five year old. I wouldn't use it even if it was free. Huge disappointment.
B00E9HCCSI|5|Fit real good ,looks also good and good deal for the money
B00TTLV99W|5|good price and service
B00FMB80CM|4|this top fits my 88 mustang GT convertible.  It does not come with instructions.  the top seems to be made of good material.  it does not come with glue you will need weather stripping glue.  also you will need a staple gun with 3/8&#34; staples.  and a scraper/knife to remove old weather stripping and glue.  and time.  and patience.  it also does not come with the tension cables.  I suggest you purchase those as well.  you will also need the weather stripping for the top front as you cannot remove the old one without destroying it in most cases.  otherwise the fit is EXCELLENT.  I wrote this post so that others will know and order that parts and not have to wait.  I live in Hawaii there is no such thing as 2 day shipping here.
B002NF0OD8|5|Direct replacement for my daughters 2000 Ford Focus wagon, rusted from too many wisconsin winters. Had to loosen nut on ebrake handle in console to get enough slack, but it installed easily. Works well
B00BZQRAIS|5|love it
B00SS3XHMO|5|Cool
B00DC6MLMY|4|so much better than steel cable.  I'll have it on every winch I own.
B00IWL4DD4|1|Had to purchase OE because the Dorman is not manufactured correctly.
B00BG8OFPQ|5|This is not the cheapest bed cover by any stretch...but &#34;best&#34; usually cost more. This cover is the perfect compliment to a shiny black GMC diesel. This cover is indeed &#34;professional grade &#34;!
B00E5OUOCQ|5|Great product, fits my 2015 Forester perfectly and does a great job of helping to keep the car cool while protecting the dash...
B003A82GV0|5|Hold gasoline great
B00N1RU46Y|5|It was the perfect part at the price.
B000JICAZ6|5|Excellent product . Arrived on time and fits perfectly well
B000PWTBHQ|4|Hard to find oil filters for 2006 Lincoln Ls. Perfect fit and the socket drive make it easy on and off.

B000BPWT2Q|5|excellent size for my Hyundai Veloster 2012'm now saving me 2 days more gasoline on the route that run daily and have better acceleration thanks
B00DNU3MIG|1|Maybe i got a defective set or something but no matter how tight I clamp these down, I can easily twist them off the battery posts. This is on a brand new Odyssey battery, very high quality and the other terminals I have clamp perfectly well. (I wanted to switch to military style terminals for the lower profile vice marine style.) I would not expect these terminals to hold up to any real abuse or vibration in my application, so they are heading back to Amazon.
B00YLQR958|5|Mirror was delivered on time and in great condition. It was literally a snap to put on. On first glance it was not as obvious as to were the heating coils would go and how they connected; I think one sheet  of instructions would have helped out greatly. Otherwise the mirror was very easy to install.
B004SL76BS|5|Finally got around to installing these pads.  They are perfect, great feel and no squeal.  Don't wast your money on ceramic or other pricey brands.
B004F63RYQ|4|Holds all that I need it to hold - love the velcro at the bottom to keep in in place in the back of the car
B003VLBPJA|4|not as great as we expected it to be.
B00BRHM8FA|5|Did exactly what I needed it to do. Was quick and easy to understand.
B000R3WQPM|5|Very strong material and arrived so fast!
B00WH1ZC80|2|Great concept but couldn't use it on my headrest  because mine is different and wasn't thinking when I purchased these. When I slide my headrest mine do not have the 2 bars when you slide it up  so there was no where to hook it. Make sure your headrest has to 2 bars.
B001FIA1OQ|5|Great would reccommend
B009NVBZT2|5|Love it
B00080QHMM|5|Great tire gauge!  Easy to use and read... and very accurate, too.  I purchased one during a lightning deal two years ago, and when it came up again at an even lower sale price, I had to get one for my second vehicle.  A great value, even without a deal price.  My 2yr old gauge is still going strong!
B00KHUQAY8|4|The product is really nice, but it had a very strong rubber/plastic smell. I had to wash it and leave it outside for about a week so I could use it. Other than that it was great.
B00029K1XK|5|Installed perfectly on a 1971 Dodge Charger with sagging 44yr. old leaf springs.<br />I bought these springs to get the car on the road and was going to order new leaf springs. I cancelled the leaf spring order because the car now rides, handles and sits like new with just the 12-1500's installed!<br />I thought about ordering the heavier springs but glad I didn't. I think the heavier springs would ride way too rough.<br />Try these first. They saved me over $800.00 in leaf spring replacements!
B00062ZMPA|5|Product fits as expected, good packaging will for sure recommend!!!
B00BGTQ1FM|5|Well not sure what to write here. It's a sticker/decal.<br />It works?
B000KQ4EBU|5|I've had these for several months now and I've found that they are more useful than I could have ever expected. They installed quickly (took about 15 mins) and the instructions were very clear. Because I they install under the window frame I can remove them any time I want without damage to my car or worries of removing sticky stuff. Love these!
B000PAM9KO|5|Fits perfect. Much cheaper than HONDA filter. Good quality and works perfect
B007Q1SPRG|3|The fender are OK ,
B001BFODG0|4|When doing a brake-replace, the brake pads (Centric ACT815) actually extended out beyond the diameter of this rotor by 2-3 mm.  The existing rotor and pads made full surface contact with each other with 2-3 mm to spare.  I'm not sure if this is a problem, feature, or nothing.  I installed this rotor on a 2011 Nissan Altima 3.5 SR at 65000 mi.<br /><br />I bought these to try to avoid my previous experiences with lower-priced rotors (on a different car).  Centric took the time to create a website that talks about their brake rotors and went into more detail than others (multiple pages, some actual technical info).  The coating on the non-rubbing surfaces was another plus so I bit.
B00JQI9LPW|3|Works how it should just that blue hose is crap, so just replace it.
B00UNTU3VO|5|Surprisingly large.... but very good.
B002UC19R4|4|Easy to connect and seems to be working well!
B002GQDX2I|1|The jack pin broke on the very first use, this made in china TOO?  CRAP!
B000UX3Z3G|5|worded great fast shipping
B00V5JVN38|5|Works great. Well made.
B00415CKEE|4|This is as heavy duty as the first replacement (from Ford dealer)handle which lasted 4 years. (Original lasted 4 years) and was less than half the price. A GOOD ENOUGH DEAL.
B002DT2AKE|3|They don't hold up well. They were ruined after a season of riding.
B00XQ6WHA6|3|I have only had these bulbs in a couple of week, and now one of them is burned out.  The description says they have a 2 year warranty...so all im needing are some replacement bulbs.
B00J3NPHH6|1|Not as bright as I expected them to be
B0019IO6X4|5|quality product
B009PAK75E|4|I have a fold fusion 2015 SE, the color is pretty however it is not fit... But for this price still a okay deal.
B004BT6N2K|5|Smooth running blade.  Easy to install and no problems.
B005CLQ3RQ|5|Fits perfect.
B006M9VIRM|5|No more rock chips in your RV or Toy Hauler.  You pay a lot of money for your rig keep it looking nice for a long time  To the person who said it would not wok with a 5th wheel that is not true we are using it with our 5th wheel and it works great.  The directions are a bit tricky but not difficult. I guess some people are just not mechanical.  There really are not that many parts you do have to trim it because some trucks are taller or shorter than others in the rear but you can use a jig saw I am a female and I figured that out with out a problem.
B000CPCC3Q|5|Delivered in time, product as described
B00AKXEZ3A|5|Very good product! Definately recommended!
B00X3EQJ1O|5|This is the same as the ones you can get at Walmart, or Harbor Freight. It is mailed directly from China and will likely take a long time before you receive it. It might be easier to just go to a store and pick one up, They're cheap. Quality of the product is same either way.
B00AOKX1PW|4|It is louder than I thought it would be but that is because I also installed afe downpipes. It would most likely be a lot more mellow if you used stock downpipes. Appears to be great quality.
B00KO7AFBI|4|It was delivered on time and looked very nice... The only thing I didn't like was that the screw on the clamp broke very easily and I had to go buy a new one. Other then that great product and my bike sounds fantastic.
B000C9MHBY|1|The part was defective.  The dealership put it in and then had to remove it.  Wasted everyone's time.  Very disappointed with Amazon.
B00T3O8L5A|5|Absolutely awesome lid, no complaints.  Fit was true and the visor was perfect for day and night riding.
B006W25ZAU|5|At this price, I was half-expecting a piece of junk. HOWEVER, this thing it well made and fully functional. Wired into the Honda pigtail and have been visible, legal and fashionable for months without any problems. Excellent buy!
B000GZL3W8|4|Item was as described. Fits great and works great. Took a while to ship out after placing order but arrived quickly after it was shipped. Overall it is great product and would recommend it and would buy from them again.
B00P2RYKYS|5|excellet product
B003T1H7IA|5|Purchased to save my piano strings from rusting. A must have in my island location.
B001HWBT00|5|was exactly as we expected
B002HIWMCC|2|The manual is not very usefull for maintaining and repairing a 39 ford. Very incomplete, not any how to step by step info
B0054YE8AU|5|This net was amazing it did what I wanted it to do, although one string ripped but it's ok because it beyond what I expected, I travel to Mexico alot and if you are looking for a cargo net for your truck which goes stacked this is the cargo net you need and will want.
B00KTJ0A0C|5|Great value for the price Works Great
B00GZLADEG|5|These are great.  I installed six on our golf cart and ten underneath our camper.  They give off a nice soft green glow.
B00BVB3LVC|3|These are easy to install but only last for about 6 months before they start to go out again. I don't know if it is a problem with Jeep or the product. It is very annoying though I am on number 3
B0011O2RYQ|5|Very nice, wide, well built in USA..
B001U9BMD4|5|Words to live by
B00AB2IE8C|5|Fit perfectly.  Came with bulbs and sockets in place.  Love the look.  A very subtle change but perfect for me.
B004E8YMNA|5|very good
B0002JMUZW|4|Went on easy and was a direct replacement on my F-53 chassis motorhome.
B00J58PP1C|3|Doesn't stick too good
B00G6HV8H0|5|Was what I expected.
B004LX3AS6|5|Awesome charger and the company behind this charger has AWESOME support!
B00SH1SN6C|5|Excellent.  Compact, but will definitely do the job.  I plan to purchase for gift giving this holiday!
B00FQ0RH8W|5|Easy installation.  Solved my problem.
B0040D2P4M|5|Yes good product for the price
B004AFTDC2|5|well insulated
B0057FK08A|5|Fits perfectly on my 2013 Hyundai Santa fe
B000SSZMPM|4|No complaints. It's exactly what I ordered. I have used it several times in the past 6 weeks and it has kept my scooter dry. I have a 2014 Honda Metropolitan. Fits well dries quickly.
B00KGIBXZM|4|so far so good
B00PQ2AXMC|4|The email and advertisement said two free gifts,I only received one.  Other than that; I'm very happy with the balaclava.
B000C1MW8K|5|perfect OEM replacement pads at low cost.
B000WK5PWQ|5|Smells great and makes plastic shine!
B00LOR6I4K|4|Kind of a PITA to work with but they work.
B00B2HM4FE|5|My 80 Corvette Hooker side pipes have a bent flange.  So I decided to try these rather than have them straightened.  These work flawlessly. A bit thick but standard bolts worked fine.  Sealed perfectly.  I have tried all the tricks and methods.  High temp rtf, multiple gasket brands etc etc.  Nothing worked.  These are the best I have used for the problem I have.  Highly recommend.
B000E7SY0C|4|Overall the rack if very good. Well designed and manufactured. No sharp edges, everything works smooth.<br />Conc: it comes with hitch connector bolt. The hole in hitch connector works only with that bolt - I cannot use a hitch lock to secure the rack from a stealing. Also if you don't tight that hitch bolt the rack can wiggle.
B005G5RO7G|4|Works nicely, but you have to superglue it on or you'll lose it. This is my 2nd one because of that.
B00PUXULO2|5|Perfect for my application. Was able to tuck it out of the harms way and it works great.
B004XMBXRU|5|This is a part that is very sure to break as per the parts department at the dealership. Problem was the part there was almost $25 more! My son put this on his 2005 Ford F150 in less than 15 minutes. Great find. Thank you.
B000IZ490Y|4|Good products
B003TTL0TE|2|I'll be the voice of dissent here, but when I have my hand in it, and it's soaking wet as I pull it out of the water bucket, the inner liner wants to pull away from the chenille outer and turn itself inside out basically.  The only solution is to pivot your hand so you always pull your hand out finger-first and not finger-down.  Gets the job done, but it's tiring to use.
B00VW0G7YU|3|Looks better than the stock antenna, but lost some reception and it required an adapter that it doesn't come with for a Jeep Wrangler.
B00HFWYZO8|5|The back mats were just a little bit too wide for my RX 330 but I love them none the less.
B00ROU39Y8|5|Thank you!
B000XQ2S4M|5|very good unit , work perfe
B00AN5T08U|5|Just what I was looking for and got best price available.
B00CHI8ACI|4|Met my expectations fully and for a great price.
B0100N3FEO|2|Well, reflection board does not fit, glue gun is a piece of crap, tabs are not build that well ( 1 bent and 2 broke after 2 days worth of use). I'm generous since their suction cup was alright.
B00MHJOFVM|5|The item arrived just as promised. The quality was excellent but there were a few small \\"dings\\" on the item. It was very simple to install and it looks great.
B0081SQY1W|5|fits perfectly over newer car rearview mirror holders, good and ridged.
B000G16JA8|4|Great stretch and net construction but the retaining clip break easily.
B001C98TR4|5|I saw mixed reviews on this item, but for the price it was hard to pass, even if it only lasts a year or two.  Luckily the install on my 03 Civic EX sedan was very easy.  Only difficult part was having the second pair of hands hold the glass to unscrew it for the track, other than that, simply.  It's been two weeks and the part is working great.  I'll update if anything changes, thanks again.
B0049MX8N6|4|Received the hitch in a timely manner however when installing the hitch on a 2007 chevy equinox the 6 included M12 hex bolts included in the kit only fit in the aft frame weldnuts and not the sides because the left and right existing weld nuts are smaller which requires a smaller bolt. No... the holes are not rusted and yes they are too big. Had to have Amazon give me a credit so I can buy the correct bolts myself.
B0052KY9BY|5|Great ervice
B008ET3BI2|5|The cover offers great protection from the sun and rain. It is not difficult to install and it's fits perfectly. the tinted vinyl is also useful.
B00WX0VSQK|1|Lights are bright look good but for some reason after about 3-4 minutes of being on the driver side bulb has 1 led that begins to flash. I can turn the lights off and turn them right back on and agin it's good for 3-4 minutes and then that bulb again starts to flash. I have a 2015 Tahoe, is this a defective bulb or do I need something else to prevent the flashing of that one led and the driver side? Also the bulb assemblies even with the built in fan get extremly hot to the touch so much so I had to wear gloves to take them out, is this normal or again are they defective? Please let me know. Thanks.
B00I8U1FDU|1|Very very cheaply made. Extremely hard to put on without making creases everywhere. Just go ahead and buy the good ones from American Muscle.
B00X2TUW1I|5|These shades are great, easy to install with the frame that they come on. The other cling shades we tried you had to try and keep them flat and get all the wrinkles out and they were more trouble than they were worth. These larger SUV ones work perfect in the back windows of my Jeep Wrangler and I am going to buy some more for my wife's car. Highly recommend. UPDATE bought these fit my wife's car, and she loves them too
B007WR25GG|5|This was great. Very easy to install and use. Held everything we needed for 5 of us for a week in FL
B00J8TNH8G|5|Good price and quality.
B0043SCBD4|1|did not work for my truck
B002JATYOC|4|Good product
B0002JM69W|1|Reasonably comfortable and looked fine, but it fell apart on the first long day.  Had been warned by other reviews that the build quality was not good – and they were right.
B0025OYEVK|5|worked great exact fit.
B00CWSK4UY|5|On time and fit perfect!!
B00EDFM3B2|5|These have been one of the best improvements for the RV. It takes just one of these to replace the 2 921 bulbs we had in each light fixture.  They are right , use a lot less power of he battery. They have held up well so far. Package came quickly and the wrapping inside was good.
B00U0HI02S|5|The family is complete ❤️❤️❤️
B000E300OE|5|Works great ,prompt delivery
B0006HOSAA|5|I needed new Lug Nuts for my 2010 charger.  The stock ones have covers that distort easily. I was highly impressed with these.  They come with 2 sockets to use when installing instead of just sending a &#34;Key&#34; to help you get the locking one on and off.  Very high quality and they give the charger a better look with the rounded tops.
B00FFAUOPG|4|Perfect fit!
B000DINK5Q|5|Hose works well but it would be best to have a set of crowfoot wrenches for the bottom fitting.
B0099RW0OO|5|HIgh Quality and fit perfectly  - thank you !
B0026CKYTM|4|Nice product. Had to do a little trimming on the Edges so it would fit correctly.  Only downfall is you can't run them at night because no light shine through.  I've even got hids
B004V8XW5C|5|Just as described, no streak cleaning
B00OP16CXE|5|Look good in car. Good product. No issues.
B000NTJHQ6|5|Great works as it should
B0024E6W02|4|Yes, I am very pleased with it, it works just as you said it would.
B00IY269GU|5|Son needed this for his jeep and this was a great price for a hard to find item.
B00T8MG2SA|5|Very sturdy item; easy to install
B00A71IJTG|5|Very good  quality!
B0030MYBNM|5|Fits great feels good
B00JZ79NJ8|5|Works very well and provides great back support on rough terrain.  Great price also.
B00390RN7G|2|As soon as I took these out of the plastic wrapping I could tell that they were not up to my expectations.  This is an exterior body part, but the particular brackets I received had pock marks and bubbles in many spots.  I feel like these might have rusted before the OEM ones that I wanted to replace them with, so I sent them back.  Rugged Ridge may have a 5-yr limited warranty on these brackets, but I do not want to have to deal with ANY company's warranty department if I can avoid it!  I ordered some Smittybilt ones ($50 more but much better quality) after returning these...
B00HYM8I9W|5|Excellent product
B008ESJOIY|5|exactly what we needed for our truck.
B000B6JPWW|1|Nice but couldn't use it. Covers everything
B000CPI5XW|5|A quality product at a good price.
B007A2PXXK|4|Great stuff.  It really works.
B0007N20UI|5|Thx
B002IVCTDK|5|Why didn't I think of this?!!? Terrific~
