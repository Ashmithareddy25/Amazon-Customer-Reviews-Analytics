B002DMX8GG|5|Awesome!
B000I64U7K|5|While I got these mittens on ebay for much less, they are actually worth the regular price. I read the reviews here before purchasing, and am so pleased, I wanted to confirm the other reviews.<br /><br />The leather is soft but sturdy and has enough friction that I can wear them for driving. The rabbit fur is divinely soft and warm. I've been wearing them in Chicago and Toronto, and they've been keeping my fingers toasty warm, even when I'm outside for a while. Moreover, unlike synthetic gloves or minutes, my hands don't get sweaty or sticky.<br /><br />The mittens are somewhat big and bulky, so they won't fit in small coat pockets. What I've done is tied a string to the little leather flap on the inside of each mitten, and then threaded the string through the sleeves of my coat so the mittens dangle at the end of each sleeve when I'm not wearing them. It might look like I'm in preschool, but now I don't have to worry about losing my mittens.<br /><br />These are the nicest, most wonderful mittens I've ever had, and they are definitely worth the money. Just be careful not to lose them -- you'll be devastated!
B007MLVQRQ|3|this dress is cute and looks nice and elegant for the price, however I found the fabric very harzard to me. It is full of little shiny lentils that is overexposed on the fabric. It was painful to try it on and I thought can be dangerous for me.
B00MCYI31U|5|Very nice!  Great color
B000BOG0JA|5|Fits good, very comfortable
B00JN5AIJ6|5|Very cute!
B008UABVP0|5|I love the feel and fit of this top...My only con is that it doesn't come in enough colors. The perfect top for skinny jeans and sandals!
B00TWIRN0G|3|I bought a red top just like this one a couple of months ago and loved it; however, I can't wear this one in black. The reason is because it is at least two inches longer and wider than the original top. If it is a one-size top, shouldn't the sizing be consistent? It is a very cute top, but the sizing is just not consistent, so I had to send it back. So sorry!
B00H4UGPJE|4|Comfortable dress!
B006L3V608|5|I've bought many pairs of this style and these are the first to stay on my feet during the day.
B004VODD9G|4|I bought the \\"newborn\\" size for my newborn.  It's sized for about a 6 month old.  Otherwise, a good quality nice hat.
B003XDO0GQ|3|This shirt is shorter then the average shirt
B003DBED9M|4|They do what they're supposed to. They have great support and are very comfortable. Plus this is one of the best deals for jockstraps on amazon. The only reason I gave them a four star is because right in between the legs they rub against the skin and can be kinda irritating but its really minor. Half the time I don't notice it.
B00P8KS6F8|5|Kool hat 😄
B00921OYYG|4|Guess I can't complain.  This shirt was advertised as being for men.  But I have a lot of men's t-shirts bought as souvenirs while traveling, and they all are fine.  This one was too broad in the shoulders, and too narrow in the hips.  So the 2nd row of words was right across my breasts, making me very uncomfortable.  Nice shirt, other than that.
B00C3CHTN4|4|I had read previous reviews and ordered a size up, I ordered a size Large (I'm typically a Small) and it fits nicely.  Its definitely cheap material but for 10 bucks, what can you expect? Its cute though and I'm happy with it. Previous reviews had stated that delivery was quick, it came before the predicted arrival time but it wasn't exactly quick, takes about two weeks to arrive. I was disappointed to find that it was manufactured in China.
B00R49DH3W|5|Cute, I like the polos from Kids Headquarters a little more, but the tee is still worth the price.
B00NY4LVT8|5|Its decent quality for an advertising t-shirt.  I think the logo is ugly.  BUT I gave it as a gift and my son, the recipient was very pleased.  He enjoys the show and this brought him a big smile.
B0054M7HP0|5|I really enjoy horseback riding which for a large busted girl can mean stuffing herself into as many as four traditional sports bras. Not this one. I only have to wear ONE bra to shows now! Someone was moaning it isn't pretty enough, but I have to disagree, it looks fine under even show clothes and anyone needing a bra this heavy duty is in no danger of her breasts disappearing.
B00LVSFO7Y|5|My grandson loves it. It's his new favorite outfit
B00J1JIA3K|4|Love the color and fabric. The sides run a little small though and can start to be an irritation by end of work day.
B00X3F0N8I|5|I bought a large based on other reviews.  It was a bit loose but not horrible.  Nice comfortable fabric and a great color
B00UJ3PA08|2|So far, wearing them with my Sperry's, the socks ride down in the back and end up bunched under my foot :(
B00GRMKRV2|5|Its so so darling! Nice silky fabric on the back that's black with all of the some titles in white.
B00B2DV0QC|1|It was not only too big around my mid body but not up top on my chest it smelt really bad I hand washed it several times and the smell did not let up very unfortunate events
B0030IEAJ6|5|These are the only panties I will wear. They fit nicely, stay put and the breathable cotton is a definite bonus.
B002ZO76OW|5|I bought this for my boyfriend 4 months ago.  He is still in the process of breaking it in, but I think that is kind of a testament to the quality/longevity of the leather.  I think it is really nice looking and I like the little detail of the dog engraving.  An added bonus of this wallet, in my opinion, is that it has limited the amount of JUNK he can/will carry around in his wallet.
B00F3IZQYO|5|Great shirt!
B000JJKIYU|5|great fit very durable
B00I8IXWQA|5|Fits just a little small, but great swim suits.
B0053ER1UU|4|A little on the small side but really cute and comfortable.
B000JIKN0A|5|I LOVE this bra - makes sleeping and night nursing very easy and comfortable. A word of warning - they run small so if you're not sure which size to get go a size bigger!
B007ZHRNAG|5|Wonderful fitting jeans, very flattering, lightweight, soft and not too stretchy.
B00C475HEQ|3|I am use to DC having their shirts benig a size larger that labeled, so I had ordered the shirt thinking it would fit the same as my other DC shirts, and it was smaller than expected.
B00NQCBZQW|4|They are a bit bigger than expected, but overall they are flattering and super warm & soft.
B00B76Y8SG|3|I was looking for a long tank.  I wouldn't classify this as tunic length.  It runs a bit small and is thin, but I'll definitely wear it when I'm layering.
B008DMUE4E|5|fit perfectly. Love the pockets with lids, the length of the pants is good for a woman like me always wearing flats.
B001E5MMCY|5|Cool crown, chicks loved it! Little hiding place inside along the back band for whatever one might want to hide ... ;)
B00BMR4D2G|4|I went off the recommendations, and it was too small. I am sure that it would otherwise be a great item
B00OE1Q1SQ|5|Nice,,,My son loves it.
B00GTB0QP8|5|I love my shaper for the price it exactly what I expected an fits to size
B008H2ETBE|4|Like the sock and they fit pretty well. The grey color kind of threw me off. I thought it would have been more heavier in the reinforcement which cost it one star
B009KPKTUW|1|The shorts are too small and I'm need to return them in total there's three shorts. How can it return them.
B009LR0DKU|4|I ordered two for a 20 something young man who is around 5&#34;8 in regular length and short. The regular had the &#34;old man&#34; fit (long arms, long to the thigh, long arms) , while the &#34;short&#34; had the correct fit for a younger trimmer man. I read on internet style sites that a lot of men order &#34;short&#34; to get that trimmer hipper look. It is an excellent value and looks great for a first job interview. Unless you're tall get the short. Get the pants in the shortest length too for a sleek look. Don't worry about snob appeal. No one will know it was a value piece its that nice. I ordered this first, thinking we'd order and if we didn't like it we'd shop elsewhere. Its perfectly hip! The twenty-something tried it on, loved it and moved on with his day.
B00FRKCZJ2|4|Very nice coat, the color is vibrant and bright,my daughter love to wear it everywhere ..also the material is very good quality!!!
B000UUBQKS|2|Not what I expected at all.  I have a couple pairs of 514's in 34x34 and they fit perfectly.  Ordered a 34x34 Acre Rinse, the waist was a true 34&#34;, but the inseam was 37&#34; at least.  Completely unwearable.  Also they were not 100% cotton, they had elastane in the waist. It made it feel stretchy and cheap. Had to return it, although i can say that Amazon's return services are top notch.  I will definitely buy my jeans at physical stores from now on.
B00NMPG1KS|3|NOT AS GOOD AS BOTTOMS UP LOUNGE SHORTS !
B004XFXK2S|4|Those kurtas are my favorite: fancy and sporty at the same time. I bought them as they have 3/4 sleeves  will not get dirty!), and cover your chest nicely (most  of the tops on  the market  have big opening in front- which are inappropriate in some working settings).   One comment: the size tend to run on the smaller side. I am small size and they fit OK but  I think that a medium will have been more loose . You need to hand wash and iron- which is OK...ish for me
B00TXO3PJC|5|Good
B000AXX68K|4|I purchased these pajamas for our Christmas family portrait.  They were very photogenic.  The red color was vibrant.  My only complaint was the fit was a little big.  Did not have time to return.  Overall the quality was great.
B00J8IDQJM|3|The one I got fits but that's because I ordered up like the reviews suggested.  I got a large but I am normally a small.  The material is okay...the back is much longer than it appears here, and the material could be thicker and stiffer.
B006HT3ASM|4|I purchased some of these for my business.  I had them embroidered and they look very professional.  I will buy again.
B0072D6LK6|5|I just love my snow leopard shirt. It is an eye catcher.It arrived very promptly as well. Thanks so much
B00DAP7K5A|5|Great pants! Good quality! Definitely worth the money
B00G5AEU5A|4|My granddaughter wore this often.
B0057X2PQM|5|Bought this for my Toddler for our beach vacation, he wouldn't take it off. He's very light and burns easily but was very protected with his hat on. Was very durable all throughout the vacation from being dunked under water and left in the sun.
B003OQTSGE|5|Glad to see that some companies still make stuff for us tall folk that are not obese. High grade materials.
B00GM1I616|5|I have found my go-to scrub top and pants.  I love the way this top fits--much more flattering curved darts in the back.  I will be ordering more colors to match the pants I already have ordered.
B00TRSGXKC|3|Cute little out fit runs a lil small
B00FRLPGKQ|2|Did not like it.  Not meant for a woman, especially in California.  Too big and clumsy. I will try to buy one made with thinner yarns.
B00KIGLVY0|5|good quality and so cute....seems to be sturdy and well made ..should be very durable
B00GC08KDG|1|Runs incredibly small and was not able to return. Buy elsewhere!
B00DMEFORK|5|I ordered this in red and am a 10/12, 38C, and ordered a L/XL which fits great. It's a little snug in the bust but I won't wear a bra with it so it feels supportive. I washed in cold on delicate and it seems the length shrunk just a little. I'm 5'2 and it hits about mid knee. I purchased for a cruise and will be looking forward to wearing it in the spring; paired with Yellow Box Pearla flip flops from Amazon.  I recommend this dress.
B009791H8Y|4|Wish it was thicker for the winterview months
B005YXYVEY|5|Good quality
B00LUCL7NG|5|Super warm, daughter loves it.
B00C77I70O|1|This s*** is to small no a true xxl
B000SKI752|5|Very cool product and thanks for the speed of deliv<br />ery
B00P1DS3UU|3|Cotton that won't stretch so gave it away
B00F9WH6G0|5|It is of high quality and is extremely soft and fluffy.  My child loves it and uses it daily.
B00K084LA2|1|Normally wear a large, bought a 3x because of reviews, still way too small :(
B00EAM76FQ|5|Great jacket
B00AEEQ74A|1|I like design of socks but half the pairs, plaid ones, don't fit -- way too small to pull on -- don't buy unless you're giving away half order
B008TOT848|1|I'm a 44h this did not fit at all, cup size was wrong and it was about 6in to small around
B006ODTBXY|4|Perfect socks to adorn my next pirate costume. If you have big calf muscles the skeleton may look a bit stretched. Nice quality and fit my size 10 feet!
B003PITL1I|5|Great Jacket!! Good quality and keeps me warm.  I normally wear an XL but I ordered the XXL, so that I would have plenty of room to move around in it.  Glad I bought the next size up.  If your going to wear layers underneath, order the next size up.  Love the plum color too!
B00E97KW12|5|I gave this beautiful coat 5 stars because it's very lovely. It feels very soft, keeps me warm all day, and a perfect fit.<br />I would highly recommend this coat for family and friends.
B00GPHPUK2|1|My kids wear size 10 I oder two of the tops it did not fit them it fit a child who wears size 6
B003DKP9FU|5|I bought this for my boyfriend, he's always wanted a bow tie, and I found the quality to be excellent and the price decent.
B00LOUFU2S|1|The &#34;Gold&#34; started peeling and really hurt my nose
B009LYDGVG|5|I am a survivor of cancer.  The chemo  & radiation damaged the nerve ending is my fingers.  I must avoid sunlight, which makes my finger tips crack & bleed making it very inconvenient when I cook.  It's hard to make bread, pie dough, biscuits, etc. while wearing rubber gloves. These gloves are confortable and cool even in the summer (I must wear them all year round.)
B00JQRWQ96|4|Arrived on time, good quality.  Great price for a 12 pack
B005AVB698|4|I bought this in black, so although its thin material, all i will need is a black bra and it will be fine. If this were in a different color, it might be a problem with being see through.<br />But other than that, its a cute shirt, fitted and flattering
B00FOSEUMW|1|To me, boat shoe socks should do 3 things: (1) stay on my heel, (2) be invisible, and (3) be durable.  I was hopeful that these would stay on my heel - but they don't.  The other two items don't matter if the socks don't stay on my heel.  So unfortunately, I'm still looking for a pair of boat shoe socks that will meet my needs.  Note to manufacturer: I believe that if the silicone grip was solid and large - covering from the bottom of the foot to the top of the sock and wrapped around the heel - then the grip might work.  The three thin squiggly lines of silicone aren't enough to do the job.
B004RZKW6Q|5|Great costume, grandson loved it and received lots of comments on it
B009GRVL92|5|convenient and practical. Great for travelling.
B007FUJJHI|3|Didn't know what an anti-stat counter jacket was, but now I do.  When wearing the jacket, it felt itchy and uncomfortable.  Definitely a jacket to wear with a long sleeve shirt underneath.  If you need anti-stat tho, it's probably an OK jacket. It's not tight through the shoulders like the regular shop coat that Red Kap sells.<br /><br />In the end, I finally settled on a Condor 4TWE9 shop coat.
B004S0KTZO|5|I thought I'd add a review for the heavier guys out there. I'm 6'2, 230lbs and I ordered the XXL under the recommendation of another reviewer here that I order a size up from what I usually get. The coat fits very well, although it is -just- slightly too big; the arms are a little long, and the hem where the armpit meets the torso is slightly too broad, but these are mostly nitpicks. It feels a little oversized, but it doesn't look it. If you're not a fashionista, and simply want something to wear that is warm and looks very nice, then this coat is perfect.
B00E1BTRXA|4|Nice piece, but the fit is a little odd. A little too big and the neck line is low. Otherwise nice quality and good looking.
B0009MIER0|5|Shirts were exactly as I expected. It hard to find polo shirts with pockets. Glad to get these
B00550PSZC|5|Comfortable bra, no strap slippage.
B00PVLQ2TQ|4|Very low profile waist wallet.  The strap is elastic and easy to adjust.  Might be a very tight fit if your waistline is more than 35&#34;.  There are 2 main compartments and a few pockets inside to organize your stuff. Quality looks good in both construction and material.<br /><br />Sample item was provided for review.
B00X77JBG2|5|Nice
B00CHJF6J2|3|tho runs extremely large. fits rather a 9/12 months. Zipper is also pretty jamming. Item should be re sized and better made to be worth 24.99.
B00L28LJ04|2|Ok
B00HJO97UY|5|Fits & looks great!
B00EGGLTI6|5|These briefs are superior to Munsingwear which did not fit well because the leg openings were too large.<br />The Jockey Pouch brief has a snug leg opening and provides the needed support.
B00NFHY0HY|5|very good
B00PYYBCO0|4|Beautiful skirt, but had to return it because it was a little small.  Most of my skirts are size 6, so this runs a little smaller than most.
B00OOITYW4|5|was to small though I had to return it and order a larger one ordered a 38 and went up to a 44
B00ILYPQ0G|5|fits exactly like the picture, a little small in the bust for me but maybe someone else would be ok, good cotton tee fabric especially for the price and the color is bright, nice top
B008CFTYW0|2|For the brand and price, more thought should have been put in design and build quality! I shipped it back the next business day. No exceptional craftsmanship here!
B004IMANXK|5|My husband will only wear gold toe socks so I decided to try these for myself. I will continue to purchase these. They fit well and best of all they don't leave marks on my legs like other socks do. Material is light but warm. Very comfortable and nice looking. Excellent quality. Would recommend to family and friends. I will be purchasing more of these.
B00NM628QI|1|With one tug of the fabric by my toddler the bottom hem tore about 6 inches.  Very disappointed in its quality.
B00FR851C2|5|Perfect!
B003L7WS54|4|Extremely tough material, and when I wash it, the wrinkles don't go away. Although, great material for the laboratories & short enough to look stylish!
B00DJNXSMW|5|Good quality and fits well. Picture as depicted of item
B002R9E1CU|4|Bought these for my friends bachelor party and they were a big hit. I didnt realize how large they were though so that was just an added surprise.
B00KBLA3DW|5|I bought the red one for my recent trip to Hawaii and I honestly loved it! The material was decent and the fit was so perfect on me (5'2, 100 lbs) It was very comfortable and it went well with all my bathing suits. Def worth having. Tempted to buy more colors
B00F92OUIM|1|I have bigger arms and this was snug, didn't like it at all
B00AW5QE8A|5|Great product and A+++ service
B00NXE2GKC|5|Can't fault this shirt. Hard to find this colour. Well made.
B00BM2L23Y|4|Admittedly it's my bad, I accidentally threw it in the dryer with the rest of the load, I hadn't meant to because I had a feeling it might just shrink... boy did it!!!  It still fits but boy oh boy it's sure not &#34;plus&#34; size anymore!  I order plus clothing so it's looser than my size which is regular XL, but this shrunk down to what I'd call an XL shirt.  Oh and the bands at the elbow are small.  They fit but pretty tight, I don't have stick arms but I'm far from Popeye arms either, I was surprised how snug the bands are.  Possibly due to the shrinkage.<br />On the plus... the pattern is even prettier in person, it fits nicely, even having shrunk several sizes, and it's not terribly see thru as some white shirts may be.
B002D48XS2|5|Amazon had these pants priced to suit almost any budget. My kids love them b/c they are soo comfortable and durable.
B00AWB0TEE|2|Product was hard to get on.  To get it on, I had to really pull on it several times, up and down to stretch it out.  Once it was stretched out, it was too large when pulled up.  There's a sheer round part that is suppose to provide lift to the butt.  It never fits in the right place of the butt area when pulled up and the sheer round part tends to end up on the butt middle area which makes the sides of your butt bulge out and not under the butt which would provide lift.  This garment is too thick and the part with the hole in the crouch area never seats right when pulled up.  DON'T BUY THIS GARMENT.  It's in by drawer and I can't use it.  Money gone to waste.
B004ZWG0NK|5|These things are sooooo comfortable! I will most definitely need to buy another pair
B00YBDV3RQ|5|Saw this shirt offered at a Discount for an honest review so I gave it a try since they got the color that my husband loves, navy blue. It was delivered so quickly and the quality is good, soft fabric, simple yet elegant design. I normally wash the new clothes before letting my husband wear them so I just hung it on the door knob ready for washing but when my husband got home from home he wore it right away and it looked good on him. Just the right fit! He loved the color and feel! It made me feel good knowing I chose a right shirt for him knowing he does not wear every shirt I bought for him off he feels they won't look good on him.<br /><br />So I thank you for this good deal and this is a voluntary review. I'm not required to write a review but I just feel like I need too share this so those who might want to consider buying this shirt will have an idea that this a good buy!
B00ORUEVVI|1|Disappointed....will never order from this company again ... Kmt  ..no stars
B00IS84GZ6|5|Perfeitas!
B00D778C1W|5|Thus jacket fitted just as expected & looks amazing dressed up or down!! I even purchased two other items from vince camuto!! Fab piece.
B00KY4QSA8|5|This is my fifth pair, obviously I love them.  Wash in cold and I put in the dryer!  No problem, no seams, just warm and cozy.  I wear them all year and they are darling.
B007ZKSEC4|5|Sexy! Sexy! Expensive, but worth it! I bought one in a medium for one look and plan to buy one in a large for a looser look. Only Heart ..line called SO FINE... is a wonderful body clinging fabric and I must have at least half a dozen that I wear in place of an annoying bra. It also holds your stomach in perfectly (almost like a bathing suit!) Wearing a bra only bulges my stomach out . The round necked version of this shirt (underbody garment ) I've lived in for over 10 years now. Washed well. Holds it shape. And the Only Hearts underwear with the cutout triangle in the back is divine!! WELL WORTH IT!!! You can wear it under your shirts or, if you're young enough, alone as is.
B00BKRMJQA|4|The dress worked very well for a wedding I attended.  My only complaint is that the back &#34;V&#34; came down a bit too far (showed my bra clasp) and had to be pinned closed more.  Also, the stretchy panel between the bust and the skirt shows every physical flaw - not the dress to wear if you have rolls to hide!  But, if you're built like the model in the item description, you'll love it!
B00GYTK4DO|2|different than my expectation
B00248043Y|5|For the price, it was everything I needed. I'm using it for my catwoman cosplay and it fits the costume. Well put together and fun to whip around outside.
B0079VL872|5|This bra was just what I was looking for! I wanted a bra with straps that don't slip off my shoulders. This bra design will prevent this I think, and that will be great. Also, it fits well and I like the easy front closure, so I ordered another one. I highly recommend this bra.
B00K1Y6FS6|5|First pair of jeans I've ever bought online. Love the color, the fit, the feel and especially the slimming effect.  Ordered another pair (short) already so I'll have a pair to wear with my tennis shoes!  Shopping in stores is such a dreadful, painful and fruitless experience for me.  I wish I would have tried online shopping sooner.
B00EY3FNBK|5|Love it! Fits perfectly, just buy it!!!!!!
B0084HVW2Q|5|Loved these socks. Took them with me on a trip and was thrilled with them. They stayed in place, and didn't bind or slip in any way. Good quality fabric and would definitely purchase more of this brand.
B00CLVHTNC|5|I absolutely love my prayer shawl. It came very quickly was packaged well. I took it out of the plastic bag and steamed pressed it. I love the scriptures in the corners. The cloth is very nice and soft. I had purchased two of them one for a dear sister at church welcoming her back and she absolutely loves it. I highly recommend this to anyone looking for a nice prayer Shawl and you cannot beat the price.
B00FYNV502|4|Goo ton a lot of comments, nice ones, every walking dead fan loves it
B00M55BP0W|4|Perfect for last minute gift
B00OIVVD26|5|great
B00CX6FVY4|5|I have had so many compliments on this item.  Unfortunately, I accidentally tore the sleeve so I will have this repaired, but have ordered another one exactly like this - that is how much I love this kurti.
B008Q0E61U|2|They look more cheap than I expected, and they are exactly tight on the tie. Definitely should have held out for a more expensive clip set
B005GVIWGW|1|After reading reviews I ordered the smaller of the two sizes I usually wear among different brands.  These were snug in the hips but super roomy in the legs.  I prefer a thicker elastic band on jeans as it seems to help keep them from dipping down in the back when you sit down...this was thinner than my favorite jeans and they do dip.  Since it cost almost a third of the price to return them, and since I am losing weight, I kept them but I don't intend to repeat this purchase.
B009379OC6|5|These liners are the best.  They are very stylish and warm. This is just the thing for a cold day outside.
B00FWKVCBY|5|Very Nice and good quality fabric size is correct
B00Q6FBZHK|2|Runs too small to be one-size fits all!  Fits like a size 10-12, and not a plus-sized item. The material is much too thin and see through to be worn comfortably with company. However, I liked that the garment is cotton instead of the much used polyester in the caftan which in my opinion is very unnatural feeling.
B008BOJ3PU|4|This top was so cute.  Showed off my figure flaws. Hated to return it.  Need to offer womans' sizes. Are you listening, Patti?
B00K1U3I6M|5|Absolutely love my deadbear hoodie! Got delivered very quickly! Very happy with my purchase! Thanks (~):}
B00QXOG8C6|5|Love it! Fits perfectly
B000A38F36|4|A nice, well made work shirt. It washes well and is ready to wear, right out of the dryer. The size is spot on but; my only critique is that the cuffs are extremely tight on the wrists. The sleeves don't clear a wrist watch and heavy boned individuals may not be able to wear them down.
B00HRKAM2C|5|Very nice dress! I like the way it's cut, fits and feels. Worth the money for sure. Thanks!
B00OZ8LJ9Y|3|A little smaller than I expected. I'm not sure if I'll wear them out in public or just around my house.
B00ESYSYDO|5|i'm 180 pounds and my cup size 38D. i ordered the Large and it fits me just like i thought it would. overall good purchase.
B0012QOTFS|5|very comfortable and does what it is supposed to do.  I'm a size 16 and ordered the large and it is perfect.
B00FGJMIB4|4|The size was right but they were really long. Have to have them altered. The details were really cute! Not worried about my butt hanging out when I bend over.
B00NORF4O8|1|It is too small, but, I can still wear it under things.
B00IO2F3US|4|I picked up a few of these shirts from Costco not long ago (in fact, I think most Costco locations still have these in stock), with the only difference from what I can tell being that the ones I purchased all have pockets on the left chest. They are well made, they look sharp, they hold up well after repeated washings and are perfect for hot weather.  They also look good in a variety of situations, be them sport-activity related or casual wearing.  They can be dressed up with slacks, or dressed down with jeans/shorts.<br /><br />They do run a bit large as they appear to be rather loose-cut.  While I am not a &#34;professional&#34; bodybuilder, I work out daily, lifting large amounts of weights, and have very large, very muscular arms, chest and back, with a narrow waist.  While these shirts are snug across the chest and in the arms, they balloon around my torso and waist.  This is problem I have with almost every shirt I come across, but it is clear that these shirts run larger than usual.  I wouldn't necessarily suggest ordering a size smaller or anything, but just mention it as something of which to be aware - they fit a bit loose and do not shrink.  That said, it's a great shirt which I recommend.
B00E0G2GQQ|4|Like I said, runs a little big.  My niece is just now fitting into it, and it's april.  Go a size smaller if you can.
B00M2QRWOM|5|gracias por su venta
B00U7ULSKO|4|nice for light weather. thank you for speedy delivery.
B0098MDI0A|5|Fits like a dream and looks amazing!<br /><br />So, packaging. It came (from China) in a plastic bag inside a plastic bag. The wig itself was in a net to help keep stray hairs from coming loose. There's a hair net included if you have really long hair. It was a little tight on my head and I don't have long hair, but I imagine if you're smaller than a 6'1&#34; guy, you shouldn't have a problem.<br /><br />I change my hair fairly often but I've never wanted to damage my hair like turning it silver would do, so I got this wig. I wore it out the first weekend after I got it and all night long people who have known me for years were asking where I'd gotten my hair done. Mind you, my hair is currently about three inches long, but this wig was so convincing that people not only believed that my hair had drastically changed color but also grown several inches. I know it's crazy, but it's a really realistic wig.<br /><br />Styling is fairly easy, but use a really light hairspray. As with all wigs, you can damage the hairs if you use anything too heavy. A few touches of Shaper Plus and I was ready to go for an entire night of headbanging fun. Yes, it stayed on all night, even when headbanging.<br /><br />Also, really fast shipping! I chose the free standard option and it took less than two weeks to get to Boston from China. Not too shabby.<br /><br />Definitely something I'd buy again if I needed to, but I see this lasting me a long, long time.
B0051U1706|5|Tried them on and fit great! Though I didn't get a chance to wear with my wool socks and waders, but hopefully soon I will be.
B00GP65OD6|5|a little tight for an xl
B00LHT9WRU|5|My son really loves the jacket. Fits him well. Unfortunately it runs small. I ordered a size bigger, but he will only get one season of wear out of it.
B00N4MF204|5|Perfect gift for my Godson!!
B009OC8JCQ|3|JUST OKAY
B0007YWT30|5|I have not found anything wrong with these and the clasps hold well. I have not washed them yet and when I do, I will hand wash. I will caution to consider wearing a shirt over these and if you don't, to be conscious that you will tear up or scratch the leather on the back of your car seat or chair. When you have done that, you won't be happy and \\"no\\" your mechanic did not do it.
B000MWV7KI|4|I have never worn bras without an underwire like this one, but it isn't bad.  Frankly, I bought this bra for a night one as it hooks in the front so you won't be sleeping with hooks digging into you.  For what I need, this is a good bra.  Holds you up fine.
B005HJ8PO2|3|Coveralls were too long
B000FGVXZ0|3|Love the look of this hat, but it is delicate and a little bit of it comes off every time you wear it...
B0090O1EDE|5|These are great!
B005ZWSZA0|5|If you want to sport the Walter White / Heisenberg look, this is the hat to do it in. Stylin'
B00BNBBKKO|5|Great!
B004X8JBQY|5|The sizing on this bra is way off. The website said I was a triple D but ended up returning that size for a D/DD and it fit much better. I LOVE this bra! It lifts and supports. It was the only thing that kept me from getting clogged ducts! It also lets you fell sexy. The cups are a little stiff when you first get it but after a few washes, it conforms to you!
B002ACP9XY|4|It looks as if it is longer than 29
B009753F0Q|5|Great look and works just as I wanted to.  Makes my skirt and blouse look more stylish. I plan to get this in other colors as well.
B00SAA65R4|3|They would be great if I had ordered extra large, he typically wears a large.
B004QJH3RY|2|first one broke in a week. the plastic back that holds it in your wallet came apart.
B00ARF87D0|4|these fit my 16 year old sun perfect.  he is a size 26 waist and weighs 119 lbs.  It has a tie waist and an elastic band  i will def buy this brand again.
B00HV8LFX0|5|Good fit, very sexy.
B000X961OW|1|Way too small
B004093WWK|2|Cute and warm, but WAY too big.  I bought them for my 11 year old daughter who is just under average height for her age and these look like they could fit me and I am 5'6&#34;.  They are huge.  After 3 weeks of wear, the bottom of the feet, the collar and arm cuffs are all literally shredding apart.  Very poorly made.  First time disappointment with an AMAZON company.  Would definitely not recommend and will not be ordering again from this company.
B002O1Q99E|5|These Satin & Lace Bikini Panty are So Sexy and Comfortable on Me!!!  The Lace is Soft and Stretchy Enough for Me!  My wife thinks they are very cute on me.  She Loves How They Show My Privates!!!  These are a Welcome Addition to Our Panty Drawer!  (I no-longer wear any Mens' UNComfortable underwear!)
B006STXOBY|4|Styling is exactly what I've been looking for. Fits like a dream. Bought one like it from Neiman Marcus years ago for over $400 and absolutely wore it out. It was basically the same material, only the material had more weight. Great thing about it is it could be thrown in the washer and dryer and come out gorgeous and ready to wear. The beautiful dress by PattyBoutik came  with no washimg instructions. Do I machine wash and hang to dry, or put in dryer or have dry cleaned or what. It concerns me the perfect dress has no washing instructions. Just got the one in red and it too has no washing instructions. I still love the red and black dresses. Because the material is so thin, just the right under garments are in question. I think a strapless cammi, and a body suit slip. But I LOVE the dresses. Please email me washing instructions.
B00E17VBOW|1|Way to small, size chart is inaccurate. Had to pay $16 to return it. Pretty bummed.
B00KVCLXGM|5|I purchased this for my 20 month old son and followed the advice of others and bought a size larger than normal. I should have gone with his true size. So that was my fault, but he will be able to wear it again next year. I just took up the suspenders so that the trousers/shorts fit.<br /><br />Don't listen to the folks saying it looks cheap. It is darling!!!
B00NOQ6LH8|5|Love it. Beautiful. Fits as expected. So happy I purchased it.
B00CN4QC3A|4|satisfied
B00H8AI2GY|4|I really like this bra, it fits really well, the only thing is that the lace is a little itchy.
B004VQREBW|5|Very comfortable. Soft material. Love it. I ordered one pack first, to make sure that the size is right. And then ordered 4 more packs.
B00OBYH54U|2|Washed it 3 times and it got holes all over the arms. Cute. Cheap material. Soft. Wash it on gentle only.!
B005VEN8N6|1|Purchase the Cream/Slouch Hat looks like it was made for a little child version. Not please I had to go out and purchase my cream color hat from department store. Was not worth the money to me. Hat was thin/small.
B007QV94H6|5|VERY cute set up.  I love the bows and plan to use this for a gift at the next birthday party I attend.  Clips are strong enough to stay in hair, and gentle so they don't pull or break hair on the way out.
B00ZBDK3DK|5|Adorable! High quality material and stitching. Stretchy neck and easy snaps at crotch. Super fast shipping. Friendly seller.
B004ELU8CG|5|For Our Families and Friends we have ordered many of these Alpaza Sweaters much to the delight of all, as they appear to be well-made, hand-crafted garments, easy COLD wash and AIR FLUFF NO HEAT dry, in a large variety of beautiful colors and sizes, keeping in mind that WE always order WOOL garments in one or two sizes larger than other clothing to allow for some shrinkage even with cautious care and wearing, and we feel these sweaters are very well-priced, considering their proved durability and warmth and softness in our opinion equal to cashmere luxurious soft snuggly warmth. We all have had many compliments on these sweaters to the extent of ordering more on behalf of other Family members and friends and for gift-giving and we all seem pleased with this find from our favorite Amazon. Thank you. Blessings.
B00EZDMXX0|5|I'm amazed at the great quality of this hoodie! It's unbelievably soft, and absolutely adorable. We are ready for some Fall weather with this hoodie, and can't wait to put it to use!
B00FYRNNYY|5|Outstanding value especially for the price.  I got this very quickly and started using it  as a replacement for my cell phone belt holder...<br />My Galaxy S3 fits the larger pocket with a slight snugness; and the second pocket is perfect for my bi-fold wallet, even though the wallet is kind of thick with money and probably 8-10 credit and medical cards.<br />I love the full belt loop, which is riveted as well on one the bottom side and fits my wide '511' belt just fine.<br />It also rides nice and snug to the belt; and while I am paranoid about leaving the zippers open, the pouch does not feel like if you did the stuff would spill out immediately.<br /><br />In terms of behavior:  The  belt bag rides close to my rather rotund frame and it feels like it well enough built that I don't need to worry about it braking and falling off.  Material??  I am honestly not sure of it is really nice pliant leather, or fake 'pleather' (which for the price it may well be), but the workmanship feels very good on this.  The zippers were a bit stiff when I first started using it (i.e I need to hold the case with one hand while unzipping;  but as I have used them maybe 20 times they have loosened up and work fine one handed now.<br /><br />All in all I would not hestitate to recommend this to a fanny pack lover hates phones and wallets in your pockets and who wants something smaller less dorky, and tighter to t he body than a fanny pack.<br /><br />HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!  PS -- good seller also in terms of delivery speed.
B00QXGBLRG|5|There working out great my mom wear them around the house.
B009325GDW|4|I'm not afraid of showing a little cleavage, but this one makes me want to wear a little tank top under it most days. Very forgiving gathering in the belly area, that moms like me will appreciate!
B002AAK0QM|5|Stunning Cotton Kurti with gorgeous embroidery. This ethnic embroidery kurti is master piece of Indian Ethnic Art. Must have collection for party wear. These chikan embroidered top blouse for women are made in extremely light cotton fabric.
B008TOSMAY|4|I wouldn't say &#34;no bounce&#34;, but close. It had a bit of extra room in the chest but after 1 wash, it sunk the tiniest bit to be perfect.
B007QQZY7A|5|Totally loved this dress! My 5-year old looks like an angel in it. The fabric is super soft and very high quality cotton, and the design is so special! It a beautuful summer outfit, both for nice walks in the park as well as for special occasions.
B00H8XNZW2|5|It fits good, It's comfy and I love it.
B004X4U51I|3|I've worn the Jockey Brand boxer briefs for some time now.  How these compare:<br /><br />1. The material is a little thinner.  This may or may not be an advantage depending on the weather.<br />2. They ride a little higher on the thigh.<br />3. The elastic at the leg is a little bit more giving.<br /><br />All in all, they're serviceable, but I can not whole-heartedly endorse them if you are particularly active.  Because of the elastic and where they gather on the thigh, they will ride around a bit more while exercising.
B007OSHLHQ|1|Much too small for the size I ordered.
B00N1NLXOA|4|Runs small but otherwise great shirt
B0007YR9J4|3|Not as comfortable as I would like
B004R8TGZ6|3|they need to make neck fit better, too large feels like its streched
B00E5640PQ|3|Too large.
B0090A7FJ0|4|I LOVE Big Bang! Sadly my set of socks came without G-Dragon. :((( While I was sad, they did come with two pairs of T.O.P. Which worked out for my friend because he's her favorite and I just gave her a pair. Still, you can't have Big Bang without G-Dragon!
B001OE0HK4|1|Ad says that it will fit to a 42-44 waist... not even close. Asking for a refund now... otherwise it will turn into a Goodwill item
B0094E5YNG|4|I would have kept this if it fit, but it compressed me like an ace bandage. Otherwise it was well worth the price quality wise. The leopard print was not too wild. I intended to wear it under a shirt. It would look cute under a blazer on a younger woman.
B00EE5MO2O|5|LOVE THESE SOCKS.
B004QF0TFQ|4|Fit well and seem to keep my feet from feeling dry.
B00FJEJJNG|2|I bought this top on June 5th from a local specialized lingerie store so I could find a bra-sized tankini top. I ended up spending a boatload, buying 3 tankini tops plus other items. I've worn this top many quite a bit this summer - it's my favorite of the 3 I purchased - but not worn overly so (not every day, about  0-3 times a week) and either hand washed or used the handwash cycle in my machine with special lingerie soap I purchased at the lingerie store.<br /><br />The colors are gorgeous, and it fits exactly right at the top (I measure at a 36DD; the top I purchased is a 34F); the cups are just right, and it doesn't 'hug' my stomach, but it does fit close to the body.<br /><br />My complaint about it? It's August 22nd. Yesterday I noticed the left underwire has poked through the material in the cleavage area. I can push it back through and tuck it under the hem, but it just pokes back through as I move. I will be using some moleskin or something in order to close it up, but I'm so disappointed that I spent $84 for an item that lasted 6 weeks. NOT HAPPY!
B0094G8QVG|5|Girlfriend loved the birthday gift, as stated before runs large.
B00IYFDWUI|4|Light weight just what I was looking for.
B00DOPKFM6|4|its fits perfectly and i wear it all the time. i have to get it again. when i first got it i didnt see the hood but i tucks under the collar which is great!
B00EJPQ8B2|5|Was a bit worried about length, I am 5'11&#34; and usually things are too short in the torso. This fit wonderfully and the material is fantastic! Will definately look for other items from this company!
B00FSZ5N0O|1|A gem was missing from the neckline. Chest area was HUGE! It wasn't cream colored but more of a nude. Just all around horrible.
B00846FHP0|4|These are a great price and for the money they are a great value. I recommend them. Probably will purchase more.
B00UZV7F02|4|This arrived in a plastic mailing pouch directly from China.  When I opened it I could smell chemicals.  This is true of every clothing item I've bought that has arrived from China, or is made there.  After deciding that I wanted to keep it, I immediately put it in the washing machine on hand-wash in lukewarm water.  The smell is gone.  I laid it flat to dry, and it came out nicely.<br />Something else I've learned is to buy at least one size larger than I normally wear.  I don't know if Chinese sizes are made for Asian women, or if they are kept small to save money, but every clothing item I have bought is always small or tight.  So I order up.<br />This top is really more of a tunic or even a short dress.  I'm 5' 4 1/2&#34; and this tunic comes down to about four inches above my knees.  It is loose and flowing on the bottom, and I think it will look nice with white or black tights.
B00EC83170|2|these were beyond too small especially considering i took the reviews into account. I had to return them. I will say even though this purchase did not work out for me,it beats the heck out of going to a store,Amazon t<br />really does make the return process easy.
B00FA7YO50|5|Beautiful shawl wrap. Prompt shipping.
B00EZORGV8|5|Great quality on the outside. Not so much on the &#34;quilted&#34; inside stitching as it's falling apart. I've had it for about a month. It's extremely warm and fits super well. Just remember to order two sizes large since it's in China sizes.
B005HVHSCU|3|I bought an extra large & it is not 8 inches wide. It is nicely made & if you are under a size 8 you might like it.  I am a size 12 & the only way I can get into it is to pull it up my legs. Not sure I am going to keep it. I have a couple of SPANX Thinstincts & I really like them.  This has a much firmer control, so would be better for those special occasions
B0018OLN2G|5|happy with fit of jean
B00RYRB6ZK|3|this dress is right for me on June the 4th, the fabric was really nice I had another dress like this with the houndstooth from another company which I love so I tried this one the fabric also is very nice on this one but some of the stitching is over stitched so much so that is bunched up that's my only complaint with this I wish that you people would please look over your product before you send it out this dress could be great if it wasn't over stitch and have a different color popping out right in the front where you can see how / stitched it is, perhaps the sewing machine jammed or something but there's way too much reading and double stitching that should not be there
B00FJ5LW6M|2|Nice potential but the insert has already split so the cards are no longer held. Would be nice if the seller picked up on this and sent me a couple of spare inserts.
B00C7XN9FQ|4|These are the Levis 510 Skinny Jean. There skinniest fit of jeans for men. These are a nice go to jean for a reasonable price with great quality.<br /><br />This particular pair (Rigid Dragon) has a dark rinse and looks good when going for a clean and sharper look.<br /><br />If you're familiar with 510's you know these can be pretty tight but still comfortable. However with this particular pair I found the waist was very tight and stiff.<br /><br />Try ordering a size up for a little more comfort. Keep in mind sizing up will also increase the size of the leg openings and so on. This is good if you have bigger legs or want a slightly looser fit.<br /><br />Also not all Levis are like this. I have bought true to size that have been super tight and some that have been loose almost resemble Levis 511 model (a slightly more relaxed skinny jean).<br /><br />If you're worried about what size to get, i would try and look for some of these at your local retailer and trying them on first. Move around in them. Walk, stretch, step, bend. After this you should know what size is best to get.<br /><br />Hope this helped!
B008HA8N2M|5|Fit great.  Good material for price.  Sturdy zippers.
B00DOEJBHM|5|Very comfortable and soft pajamas.  I'm normal sized, 5'4&#34; 120 lbs and these fit just right.  Nice thick cotton that was soft.  Pajamas hold up in the washer and dryer and seem very well made.
B005JPONK4|5|Jacket was a perfect fit and was delivered promptly just in time for the coldest day of the season for our area I was very satisfied.
B00DTDCBHK|5|but it was a little small for me and the material at the top is not as pretty as it was shown
B00YMELC1Q|1|very bad quality
B00K758RY4|2|Very cute but 1 time through the washer and the hem on the skirt is falling out in many places. The silver letters are almost clear after 2 washes. And it hasn't gone through the dryer at all.
B001G6A12O|4|Lovely hat and good quality materials. The buttoned band is really a nice touch. I don't have a large head, but this hat hurts! It squeezes my head mercilessly and I get a red line across my forehead. Made in China was disappointing. Great flattering style!
B00CXODWYC|1|However it didn't wash well, tore in the wash.
B00EUED9NC|5|The sleeves are a bit short (to my wrist, so not too short, but normally sweaters go about an inch or 2 past) and the sleeves around my wrists are large, though I have small wrists. It's overall very soft, comfortable, cute, and has worn really well. Worth it! I'd order it again, just maybe a size smaller.
B001RVEYIU|5|True to size and officially licensed.<br />FLCL is an anime, a great anime, a great bit of nonsense that is the signature of Gainax Studios these days.<br />If you're looking at this shirt and considering buying it because it has a cute kitty on it I suggest passing because undoubtedly someone will know what it is and want to talk about it because it's very Fooly and somewhat Cooly.
B004GB72DW|5|Great!
B004W1CUVK|4|It`s Ok
B00WNEHHCU|5|Great fit and strong
B00A7HHPT0|5|Would not trade them
B00YVPQR4I|5|I am a US size 2 and I ordered a size small which fit me perfectly. The material is super soft and comfortable to be worn for all day. I got in the color mocha and it looks really nice. I went with a different color than the traditional black. It turned out great. The stitching is seamless and smooth. It can be easily washed in the washing machine given appropriate settings. You can pair it with a crop top and heels, or a t shirt and leather jacket and a bag. It would look great!<br />Sample provided without any obligations.
B001XUQQNQ|5|This is a Christmas gift for my grandson, but I know he will love them.... They will probably be summer pajamas as well as imaginitive play!
B00862LY3Q|2|I wanted a cheap mask for halloween and this definitely was that. other than a slightly tacky fake gym on the forehead its pretty cute considering it was like $5 and putting it on it looked good...kept vision open. on the other hand i wore it for about two minutes before it was so uncomfortable i had to take it off. The nosepiece is way to tight and i have a fairly small nose. unless you can deal with you nose being smushed all night id suggest something else. If you're cool with that though its pretty especially for the price
B00HSMEW8Y|2|The cups are small and cut in from the arm pits.  The color is very pretty and the straps feel nice, but overall, not a comfortable bra.  I will keep it, but it will be relegated to 'in case of laundry emergency' wear.
B00DUH12EI|5|excellent
B0050AFX9S|5|Nice, but a little bit too big
B00074MEYE|5|Very comfortable, great looking when worn with a suit.
B00R1O74IE|5|Good socks.
B00EFEHOSI|5|Great shirt for holiday weekends! Had multiple people trying to buy it off my back. Good customer service. Would definitely purchase again in the future.
B00NB690F6|5|Thank U
B00KAXXP5Y|5|Fit is great and isn't cheaply made. Love it! Ordered a small fit 34C top perfectly!
B00KVOXEDK|3|the comb seems to be made out of sturdy material. all gems arrived intact. be sure to pay attention to the size. it is much smaller than i expected. the crown would look good an a little girl but not an adult
B00AKQNR0O|4|My wife bought these pants for an upcoming overseas trip.  She said she wanted something relaxed-looking and comfortable.  \\"These are perfect!\\" she announced, when she opened the box.  She bought them in grey.  Unfortunately, upon closer inspection, the drawstring was missing.  I urged her to contact Customer Service, and assured her that Amazon would solve the problem, even though, as she reported, her size was sold out.  \\"Don't worry,\\" I said, \\"that is their problem.  They will take care of it.\\"  Well, Amazon agreed to take the pants back and refund our money (no kidding), but my wife wasn't parting with them. Finally, the representative offered a 15% discount. After putting us on hold for five minutes, she returned to report elatedly that the 15% discount (about $8) had been approved!  Yippee!  She sounded so excited.  I guess our enthusiasm did not match hers. I don't know how these got shipped out without a drawstring that gets threaded through the waistband.  If my wife didn't love the pants so much, they would go back in a minute.  She will make them work.  But, Amazon, you have let us down.
B00NSUZX0G|4|I like this product, but I found it to be a little too small around--otherwise, great.
B00J8L2PCS|5|HERMOSO
B007VUKH9G|5|He loves it. Wears it every morning
B00EHMZ7UA|5|This I loved, but my granddaughter is not as slim in stomach area. So this was passed on to my great granddaughter. Great outfit.
B008XN3BGG|5|The slip worked great with my daughters dress for the wedding.
B005DA1UHE|5|well made they are very comfortable
B00I3J687Y|5|Great bathing suit. Very cute. Fits my daughter perfectly. We got size 6x, which is her normal size, so it was neither too big nor too small. She loves it.
B007XOXYRW|4|This is a great belt and performs how it is designed to perform.  As others have mentioned in their reviews, the only slight drawback is difficulty in threading the belt through belt loops when you are wearing your golf slacks.  The corners on the square edge on the end of the belt tend to catch the top or bottom of the belt loop making it difficult to thread it through when wearing the slacks.  This could be remedied by either threading the belt through the loops before putting on the slacks or by rounding off the end and the manufacturer should consider doing this as a modification.  Other than this minor criticism, the belt works great and I am sure it will out wear any leather belt designed.
B004R2AAJS|5|I have used these Champion bras for years and when riding horses & they offer great support.  The price was affordable and the fit is just right. I have no complaints at all.
B004F68IWW|2|This looked like a nice comfy bra for relaxing around the house, but it was WAY too small in the cups.  Quality was good, though.  Pay special attention to the sizing if you order.
B005GYGEXC|5|I bought these to wear for yoga and as leggings. The fit is perfect. I ordered a Large and find that the fit is smooth and not too tight. When washed, even in cold water, they may shrink a bit and they'll still fit. I'm ordering another pair.
B00B7MBMC0|5|Very satisfied about the quality of this product. Tommy is one of my preferred mark. I will recommand this product to friends and colleagues.
B00EARSJHU|5|Fits well and pattern was a perfect match to my other multicam items
B00GSUHQEE|2|disappointed with fabric and fit
B00NMFQLEE|2|Should have read the description closer, this pops up in WOMANS long skirts.  It's a childs skirt
B00553XPG8|5|When you have a large bust, it is incredibly difficult to find a sports bra that actually provides a good amount of support. I finally found it in this very comfortable, supportive bra.
B00T7TZSYI|5|Comfortable, generic, cheap. Exactly what I wanted.
B00P92BAV2|5|Item arrived wrinkled due to minimal packaging and international handling. Just steam or low heat iron. Normal size 4 US. Purchased size 2 from chart. Fit Perfectly, this dress stretches and is very wide at top proportionally. Quality and color excellent for price. Photos night on town stunning. Many compliments. Pin/brioche necessary to secure V bust.
B00EK93DOC|5|Absolutely perfect. I read the reviews saying the dress was shorter than expected but honestly I wish it was shorter. I'm only 5'4&#34; but it was exactly as I hoped. Beautiful dress.
B00FG0FT4G|5|I'm glad I ordered this shirt. It fits really well and is very comfortable. Would recommend for any Liverpool fan!
B008Y8WNOG|5|Fits just right, maybe a little long on the arms, but no worries.
B009FQDWDM|4|This is a great little crown and more durable than most. But it didn't take a lot of force to break when the back ends were pulled apart too far. I think it could last a long time for an older child but not with a 3 year old.
B00IRE59RU|4|Actually I bought these for my sweet 18-month-old granddaughter.  She just loves them; she is obsessed with stars; her and daddy look for stars on their evening walks.  Good quality and average price.
B002JBB3MW|4|The Dress was shorter than I would have liked, but otherwise fine.  I would have like a wider headband.
B00X8WXLZ8|4|Comfortable shirt, washes well. Ordered two more in the next size up because I thought the medium was a little too tight for me. I'm usually a medium or large in juniors depending on the shirt. Overall good buy. Would recommend.
B00J1LW5ZC|5|These horns look exactly as pictured, very nice quality.  I bought them for my 8 yr old daughter and its pretty big (even large for my adult sized head) but we can easily make it work by wearing a stocking hat underneath.
B00N70B0BS|5|Very good
B00KIZHCU8|5|Absolutely love! I'm fairly short so I was worried this would be to big, but it fits great. Arrived a day before it said to be here, wich I have no problem with!
B005VVSEDS|3|ok
B00AAYDHYC|5|I would recommend this to others. My daughter is a Hello Kitty freak and has a shrine in her room.
B00KRE119I|5|Good
B00GOEGXSY|3|Size up! It is a beautiful swimsuit, though, and it does a wonderful job of hiding my small mom-tummy.
B00O9GL460|5|so comfy and cute, perfect
B00CC6ZVU4|4|Very cute! However sequins fall off
B008RMD8M0|5|I purchased this for my fiance and he loves it! he wears it all the time! It fits wonderfully and the print looks awesome!
B001SESA6I|5|Good quality.  I hope Gerber could provide more sizes. 6-9 month and 9-12 month babies also like organic cotton onesies..
B00FEOR7IU|5|I work in the freezer department of a distribution center and these socks do a good job of keeping my feet warm.
B000FMQH2S|3|I wear an 8-10 and this dress was very small in the chest but a little big elsewhere.
B0078Z1VYE|4|All the pieces fit very well into my costume. However, the lace is a bit itchy in the collar. And the apron is just a bit smaller than I would have hoped. Good quality, and I was pleased overall.
B00JOAM8KC|2|Lovely basic blouse
B00JGMX7EE|4|Love this outfit, wears pants much more than jacket, so versatile.  Has been washed several times and still looks great.
B00UZKOO98|4|It's beautiful and well made, but it runs about 2 sizes small.
B0031AZOIO|1|Once I managed to get into this body slimmer, I found myself unable to breathe.  I tried to relax but then I started to feel faint so I decided to take it off.  After several attempts of trying to peal this garment off of me, my only other option was the CUT it off of me with scissors.  very upsetting.
B00FNIZ60S|5|Nice shirt
B004QF0TFQ|4|as above
B00G9MZPMG|3|Pretty but not very sturdy.
B008DNLNS4|4|I love levis,  great fit need more colors  and levis never go out of style<br />doesn't matter short or tall
B00CFYPV8K|5|best wallet I ever had
B00TXX1UB8|5|The material is much better than I expected ...it shows off curves...I will definitely order from this company again
B00O1PRII2|5|Pillow soft and no lint!
B00HKVS5JU|2|I ordered an 3t and it was more like a 12mo. Also in the picture the shorts has several lines of ruffles, but the ones I got only had one. Very disappointed.
B004LWZ1FM|4|We will see how the snaps wear. In this same series, I bought one body suit with short sleeves, one with long and one long sleeve t shirt---all different graphics. I think the wolf looks a bit off but the marmot and tortoise are great! It is a great graphic series!
B00E0ILJC6|2|The material is thin and it doesn't fit quite right . I would never reorder them.
B00DDKLWT2|5|This shirt is very soft 100% cotton and well designed.  Perfect for a night out or for work casual.  If they offered it in 30 colors I would buy them all.
B00FRUK3RI|4|The lace overlay on this dress only goes a third down in the back (the rest is that emerald green color). I was not crazy about that, but what finally made me return it was the rather loose fit which completely concealed my waist and that looked unflattering on me. On someone with a different build this could be very pretty.
B00245BPYE|5|The pants fit great, the fabric does not fade fast at all! I wash these all the time and the wear and tear on them is not noticeable. I have had these pants for about 4 months, wash 1-2 times per week and they still look like new. Very pleased.
B00430U30U|5|My wife love it
B00L9JJU02|5|My wife loves this hat!!!  She's had lots of compliments on it.  It can be dressed up or down.
B00INA0EB4|5|Love it, fit me perfectly! Wore this to a theme park on family vacation and everyone loved it. Kept me cool and covered.
B009SDC1SY|3|Great shirt, but when purchasing, keep in mind this shirt runs extremely large, and it's pre-shrunk cotton. The individual we gave it to will need to use it as a sleep shirt instead of just a shirt.
B00AO4HZLO|1|Colour is completely different which we ordered and size is not appropriate if we want large you have to order medium
B0043WJAMU|5|they are the best, you can hardly tell you have them on under your clothes and they are so light weight and still keep you warm as those other brands
B002XGIXIK|2|The headline says it all! These are more like thin, footless tights than leggings. Don't get these if opacity is important. Also, if you have thigh-rubbing issues, these will do nothing to help you. Pretty colors, though.
B00E4YF6NY|5|These are great. I bought them to wear to at comic con but I will surely wear them in public. It hurts to see in red but you get used to it. GREAT for cosplaying terezi or her ancestor, definitely worth buying!!
B00EMG3VN6|5|excelente
B00AARFICI|5|Awesome sweater and fits nicely.
B000EWDD94|3|It meets my needs, to protect the headband on my hats from getting sweaty and gross, but unfortunately, now I have to buy new hats that are a larger size!
B00FOPME78|5|These are heavy, warm and soft.  Love it!
B00GN3GN90|3|I love the style, but the bust is too big.  With no underwired, it's very lose and I've had to make some adjustments.  I love color and style and fabric, just not the bust.
B005CSOV3C|3|Material on the inside comes out and sticks to skin when the temp. is high
B007JA9TG0|5|Great material My Son Looked so cute in it Thanks ☺
B009LM2OVQ|5|nice BANKI
B00K315HHM|5|Very impressed with this product for the price paid. I am not too sure what some of the other reviews talk about concerning smell and size as the one I received smells like leather with the size perfect for my travelling needs
B005CSOJKW|4|I'm having difficulty getting the drawstring to the &#34;right length&#34;, The bands on the bottom cause them to drag, but not nearly as bad as the open leg ones. The weight of the fabric is light enough to wear most of the time, for sure indoors.
B00JAFULNC|5|Intentionally went up sizes on this so it would be a bit longer, and it was a good guess.  Very cool and comfortable, great for lounging around the house in.
B004GG62T2|4|This boa adds glamour to my outfit, I bought it for a costume party. It sheds feathers every time I wear it, though so far not a lot of feathers. Am noticing that dye will rub off on my skin (my boa is black) and I hope it doesn't turn into a big problem on party night.<br />It is full and fluffy.
B00DEZS24E|5|The quality of these collar stays is high - I was expecting something a bit cheaper-feeling for this price.  Thanks for a great product!
B000H3G1XA|3|little to large
B00S7U8D5O|4|Nicely made small polo shirt. Looks good, cleans easily (for a white shirt!) and doesn't require ironing.<br /><br />Not as pleasant feeling as a cotton shirt, but that is the nature of synthetic fabrics.
B00JEZ0A02|4|I was looking for this type of top to take on vacation to Florida so was happy to find it in time for my trip. The reason for only four stars is because I don't like the way the placket tends to &#34;pop&#34; out on top of tie. Apart from that it was exactly what I was looking for. I choose to wear something underneath because it is thin.
B00029PLI0|1|I ordered this parka online. I started to wear the parka during a cold spell. It was extremely warm, however the Quality of the jacket is questionable. I only wore the parka 4 times & 1 or the loops already came off.  The zipper is terrible even though I used a wax candle to help it. I can see that this parka will be a ONE SEASON coat, if that. The manufacturer Rothco should be ashamed of producing such an inferior product. I would seriously suggest to the buying public that they stay clear of this product.
B006G9N4OS|5|I bought for support while breast feeding. Cheaper than maternity bras but honestly they provide great support and easy access with the deep open &#34;neckline&#34; as well as the option to open the front for even easier access. Very supportive and can wear with wider neckline shorts which is also great with breast feeding. Also very comfortable
B003N18GRM|1|Wallet was on the small size barely fitting a standard US currency but the biggest problem I had was that the little leather tab used to open and close the zipper started falling apart.  The ring that the leather tag was connected too was also akward to try and attach a replacement pull tab to and eventually the thing broke.  Last wallet lasted me almost 10 years, this one less than 1.<br /><br />I ended up having to cut the zipper off so I could actually use the wallet until I find another one I liked.
B00LBQCYWO|5|Jacket looks amazing. Hood works perfectly with the outfit. Can't wait to see my friends jaws drop this Halloween!!!
B0034J9OAQ|5|Great fit, easy on and off her arms. Great color and quality. Would love to see them in patterns and ruffles.
B00XD5CH28|1|I did not receive the item I ordered and the shorts are see-through. I intentionally ordered a dark color for the main color with a light colored trim, but received light colored shorts with a dark trim. Disappointed! Fits as expected, though I am annoyed I must now go through the whole return process.
B004ZI5EZO|5|Looks damn good on my fav female at the beach, on the bike, or wearing with jeans and boots....simply badass...
B0012UZNNG|5|i bought several of the cheaper nursing bras initially and wish i had saved my money in the end by getting this sooner.  it's excellent quality and support.  it is super comfy and has held up incredibly well considering i wear it nearly every day.  i got a 34E, and it fits like a charm.  it is hard to find bigger cup size on a 34!  at first when wearing it, i was like, what is all the hype about, and literally as the day went on, it was like, ah-ha!  this is really comfy!  best of luck!
B007SU3E6M|5|I liked a lot, this has been a really good purchase.<br />My baby is going to born in a few days and I`m happy with this product.
B00TN26LOK|3|The bow isn't as cute as the picture but i like it otherwise.
B009VI7TCE|5|I have circulation problems in my feet, so I need socks that are both warm and loose fitting.  These are the best and most durable ones I've found.
B00DN3F6QY|5|The material is heavy and substantial, and the colours are lively and eye catching. Size seems to be on target. Love it!
B00LU4EQZK|2|the 49ers lettering is light orange. not red as shown in the picture.
B0076KPRKA|5|Looks and fits great.  Will definitely buy more.
B001AQK0EO|4|Nice product. Sizing is too small. If you are a large, you must order xl.
B013HLR4SO|5|good soft distressed jeans
B009YR19NW|5|I ordered this shirt when I first found out I was pregnant.  It was adorable when I barely had a bump with leggins and boots.  I'm 7 months along now and I have a substantial bump.  This shirt is still my favorite.  It looks great with leggins or maternity jeans.  This has been my favorite shirt all throughout my pregnancy.  I always feel put together when I wear it.  As for the fit, I ordered my pre-pregnancy size and it has fit well the entire way through.
B00IJ73EEA|5|like the bag
B008KH1QY4|5|Great shirt would buy again
B00STAISHU|5|Easy breezy... Size 10 fits well for a DD+ with 43&quot; hips. At 5'-7&quot; the dress hits about 4-5&quot; above the knee, not as short as on the model.<br />Great sun protection with the high neck and sleeves as I found when I went kayaking in it and it held up, also not too hot.<br />Beautiful dress for summer. Pink is more coral-color. Handwash.<br /><br />Edit: I have been machine washing it and it's a-ok in my experience.
B00LMI9A6Y|5|Very comfortable.
B00L1G5LO2|4|I bought a large/x-large because I wanted my four year old to get the most life out of it. She is fairly tall, and it fits great (about 4 inches from the ground). It is of better quality than most store bought costumes. I am satisfied with the quality. It wasn't the best price, (about $20) but that is my only complaint. I would have made her one myself, but I didn't have time before Christmas. Overall, this is a good product.
B00EOSKJZ0|1|Ordered these jeans waited for a week or so for them to arrive only for them to be to small. Size i ordered is my size however they fit much much smaller to the point they wouldnt button. Another thing they say flares yet they are just straight legged jeans pretty much bootcut. Not what i expected. Really dissapointed.
B009EQVIMK|5|Bought my first pair at Kohl's, ordered three more from Amazon. Love the way they fit, I am 5'3 and chunky and the 12P is perfect fit. My usual problems are length and baggy legs, not with these jeans! A new favorite  and the price us right
B00400Q1WC|5|Granddaughter wears a 7.  Purchased an 8 based on other reviews and it fits her perfectly.  It is prettier than the picture and so soft.  Has a nice satin lining and well constructed.
B003OBRRFI|4|Excellent sports bra - holds everything in place for running and other strenuous activity. A couple critiques:<br />- The silhouette is a bit out of the 60's - a bit pointy for my states. But since it does the job at the gym, I'm not going to hold it against it too much.  - I also would prefer it cut a little lower in front, so it doesn't show with some of my tank tops.<br /><br />Overall, though, it gets the job done and at $20 after taxes, the price was right. No regrets about this purchase.
B00WAO32F4|5|Looks amazing and feels amazing on. I am plus size lady and it's very figure flattering.
B00OKCHXSG|5|Very comfortable warm sweater. Hood and body are lined with Sherpa fleece. Arms are lined, but not with Sherpa. I got this sweater in large because I like big sweater but the thing is huge on me! It is so comfy that I wear it anyway. Doesn't do much to block the wind. Overall, for the price I am happy with this purchase.
B00C86W34A|4|I bought this as a Christmas present . It runs true to size and is great for cold weather. It looks so  cute on.
B00QR5UGWE|5|So comfortable. I would buy one in every color if I could!
B00P57ODCY|5|Looks great on and will continue to wear my hat long after my hair grows back.
B003DWZN9U|5|Great color, good quality, perfect fit. Get lot's of compliments when I wear it
B00VVYR33G|2|I purchased a size larger to be on the safe side.  The side of the cup are cut too narrow it allows for &#34;spill over'. The band around the chest does not stay in place the bra keeps going up with one's movements.  So you have to frequently pull it down.  The colors are cute and fun, it is soft against the skin.  Unfortunately the cup is poorly designed and therefore poorly fits.
B00O0I23LC|5|Super cute, comfy, & soft! Fast shipping as well.
B00V635H1W|5|Great for around-town wear, also
B00AK7Q73M|1|Fits as expected but did expect some support and there is none.
B0085BNFIA|5|Love these! They're actually more like yoga pants than sweat pants.  They're thin, but REALLY comfortable!  As soon as I tried them on, I sat down and ordered two more pair!
B00FZN1ADI|3|I am 5 8, 170 lb. My underarm wing arms when stretch, due to work outs. Makes the jacket kind of tight else overall is fine. Is idea for a very slim guy, and less chest muscles, back body muscles.
B00188L5BG|5|They are perfect used them for years and still by more, they are good forever.
B00H3VS6QO|5|I would recommend this item, very well made
B00HFE5KZ4|4|I ordered a size larger than my measurements and it's still to small.  Maybe after I loose a couple pounds.
B007VDO97O|4|Only disappointment was the sizing.  I ordered an adult small and it was more like a youth extra large.  I have ordered other &#34;Kenny Powers&#34; shirts and none ran small like this one.  I wish I would have ordered this one in an adult medium because it did shrink a little bit as well and now really does not fit the person it was purchased for.
B00ATCBUHQ|4|I LOVE IT BUT NOT WATERPROOF
B00AKLKBQM|5|LOVE IT! LOVE IT! LOVE IT! LOOKS VERY NICE ON!
B00KMIPCXU|5|Love them!
B001XON4BY|5|good item, good price, fast shipping
B00F4NQ5UM|5|Fits true to size, color is exactly as shown.
B00EDHVTSS|1|I  WEAR XL AND I ORDERED A 2 XL ;IT FITS LIKE A MEDIUM.  NO WAY IS THE SIZING CORRECT.
B005V04924|5|Very easy to buckle/unbuckle unlike the other belt I bought at the same time. It slides in and out very smoothly.
B00HD5IV0Q|5|love this sweater
B00RVYUIEQ|5|Gave it away but the material feels really good.
B008SAJR3A|5|EXCELLENT
B003TNCLXY|5|Just the right ammount of coverage, and comfy!
B005CSNVXS|5|These are great quality and very comfy.  The fit perfectly and happy I got them at a good price.
B00G49G4E2|3|I plan to return it and exchange it for a larger size. It's too small but really cute. Such a pain to send things back.
B000XB9RSM|5|I bought this to wear in Hawaii this year but the material was too thick. I'm going to wear this as a scarf or shaw this winter instead. The pattern is beautiful and the quality is superb!
B00VJDZSXG|5|Love it
B005RZKEHC|5|I was very happy with this purchase. This fits very well and I particularly like having support in the bust area because my girls are big. My boyfriend loved it and I felt very sexy putting it on and well... Sorry, what was I saying?<br /><br />I replaced the G string with pink crotchless panties and wore high black heels and I never felt so desired in my life! My boyfriend had to pick his jaw up from the floor when he saw me in this. It hugs ALL the right areas! He wants me to wear it again, but I have other lingerie that I need to try out. Still I am sure I can arrange a repeat appearance. Hehehehee!
B00K8PIRZ2|1|im stuck with this nice blouse its absoulutly too small and its a xxl wrong size im usally a large
B00KZIQZQK|1|Inadequately described.  APPARENTLY large in China isnt large here!
B00O3H3XLY|5|Awesome
B005DIGIHI|5|I've already sent my review yesterday.
B00ESG47HO|5|Just got mine today and when I opened the package I knew it would be smaller than expected (it worried me at first) but once I tried it on it was seriously the perfect fit. Definitely get a size larger; I went with what others have recommended and I am so glad I did because if I went with a medium I really would have ended up giving it to my little sister--to be on the safe side I went with extra large it just made it that much better for me.<br />The inside of the hoodie is super soft and great, the hood is a bit smaller than anticipated but I'm absolutely fine with it, the printing of the emblems are fine also, the strings of the hoodie aren't long but again, I really don't mind.<br />The delivery was expected to be at July 25 but it literally got here a month early! :)
B00BY5ED8K|5|Excellent, would recommend!
B003ZVU2L8|1|Did not like the material
B00NFNA4VY|3|Cute! My 2 yo likes it!
B00BPFIU8S|5|this was a present for my daughter for her wedding day and was very happy with fit.
B005CEWHFK|5|I bought two of these jackets before Christmas, one in XL for my son-in-law and one in L for my son. Fit was true to size, and there were no quality control issues (as in, missing stitching, uneven arms, etc.)  Both recipients raved about them. They remarked especially on the weight to warmth ratio, and on the fit - which they described as &#34;not sloppy&#34;.  Son in law especially liked the numerous pockets. He is a busy guy and leads a complex life - he needs to organize his gear methodically.  For his needs. this is a very useful jacket.  Finally, the styling is a welcome variation from the uniform imposed by the domestic market leader.  Not knocking them.  These Helly Hansen jackets are the &#34;thinking man's version&#34; of the outdoor fleece.  I hope to see them in wider distribution.
B0010VQ93K|4|Very nice wallet.  It is a bit larger than the average wallet which is nice.  The leather is super soft and does not have to be \\"worn\\" in.  It does not have a holder for pictures and is a little pricey.
B009YK9GHA|5|Nice dressy t shirt to way this summer. 100 percent cotton and the front lining avoids having to wear a camisole. Good value and true to size.
B00PDDQFZI|4|Nice LIGHTWEIGHT jacket! My 3yo wears size 4-5. Ordered size 6  just right! I think a 5 would have been to tight. My daughter loved it!
B009AFC4N2|3|Meh, it was cheap. I'll give it to someone for Christmas.
B00KTGPU50|3|Not exactly see through but lacks substance. Haven't washed it yet but i don't have much hope for this to last much beyond a few.
B00FCBBWNG|5|This sweater was bought for my daughter and is too cute! I also bought her the high cat stocking to complete the look and it is actually long enough to wear as a dress if she chooses. It is true to size and comfortable.
B001HBQGS6|4|It works. Keeps all of my hair up and hidden whenever I wear a wig. and it's my skin color, so it's not very noticeable if it peaks out.
B00MO3YDGS|5|EXCELENTE!
B005N7YXZ8|5|This band fits great with enough give to hopefully last my whole pregnancy (16 weeks now). Better price than in stores!
B011P5WMHM|5|Great keychain i love it
B003WXIYQY|3|Good shirts, but the color fades very quickly, more so than other brands like Hanes.
B007SOMDHY|5|This is a great dress for the summer fits true to size. If the evening gets cool just add a short sleved cardigan and you are good to go. I am thinking about getting it in an other color.
B00LVJ9V3G|5|great shirts and they came well protected.
B002M8KLFM|4|this is an absolutely beautiful dress. though the pattern on mine does not flow as nicely as the one pictured, yet the description states \\"The dress you order will be exactly the same.\\"  it fits perfectly. though i was not aware that the torso to the lower hip area would be formed. it would be great if it were only the torso and it is at an angle rather than a straight cut.   it arrived today(10-19-2010) and my estimated arrival was 10-20 to 10-25. it also arrived with a shaw of the same white satin fabric, before i took it out of the clear wrapper, i realized a small slightly yellowish stain.    other than the little things that i mentioned, i love the dress. it is absolutely beautiful
B00CFQOG1Q|5|This was quite a high wasted dress, but cute
B00K24HADE|5|i love it
B0045H0L1W|5|everyone I give one of these to, just love it..
B003VZFWB8|5|So many of the undies today for girls don't give enough coverage. These are perfect! Very soft material and well-fitting. My 9-yr old loves them.
B00MYTVPCC|5|I bought this for my costume fit perfect, the only this wrong with it is the string, it was too short. I recommend going to your local craft store and buy a longer string.
B00PRTDAJM|5|These are excellent undies. I bought several packs as holiday gifts!
B00GWB9N5O|3|These say &#34;Big Boys size small, they would fit a four year old.
B00A2WL1G8|5|Cute top! 5'3&#34; 126 lbs. got the XL because of the reviews and it fits great. Not too snug and is casual and comfortable.
B00R6CJQE6|5|Very nice
B005151012|4|Its a great product. My only complaint is it does not hold more than 5 cards. Other than that it holds money very well.
B00097E7R6|5|The item was delivered quickly and was exactly what we wanted.
B00OFHLL6Q|3|Im 5'8&#34; and purchased for a special outing but outfit was just a bit too short to be appropriate for said event. I wore it with tights and is cute as an oversized top
B002PBHTTC|1|I am returning this wig - it is cheap, does not stay on your head and does not have the amount of hair shown in the picture. AWFUL- looks NOTHING like the picture
B002N3507K|5|Fits great and I'm larger too it looks great. I use it in my classroom for myself when we have &#34;royal&#34; day on Fridays!
B008PI67MO|4|My son just loved this shirt!  He wore it to comic con with his mask and wants to wear it for Halloween also.
B009MJ5S4S|2|Product is smaller than last purchase of same size trunks. Also, last product came completely apart during lap swim! Split up the side all the way up leg. Eek!! Up until then, they were great. Won't purchase these again. Too bad really, because they look great.
B00IALI60C|5|nice denim weight, good construction and sizing. like the wide seams and heavy stitching.
B0085Y1QLU|5|The color of the tie I purchased was the exact school color needed!!! Other students wanted one!!  True to order and competitive price!!
B0036URN9M|5|I expected the crown to be metallic but the way it is will work. thank you. the color, everything else is the way its appears
B001IYP9HG|1|these run really small, they are not suited for grown women, I think the large is in girls sizes because I wear a medium in most spandex, but because these appeared small I ordered a large, but I could not get them over my thighs, gave to charity
B005GYGEWI|1|Upon receiving and wearing these pants I thought that they were good, fair quality for the price. They would fit my needs, for the most part. HOWEVER, I was quite disappointed when my husband noticed that upon bending over, these pants are COMPLETELY see-through. I made him take a photo of me so that I could see for myself, and to my horror, he was absolutely right. I had already gone to the gym twice in them, but I will not wear them in public again. They fit fine, the feel fine....I just don't want to moon everyone at the gym. :-o Please check them out before you wear them in public, just in case.
B00K7B3CAC|2|The fit is snug for the size I usually wear. However, the quality of this jacket is good and I get compliements when I wear it. If you like a snug fitting then this is the jacket for you.
B007OWVBP0|5|These are snug and I believe the heavy weight jammies I bought for my husband, and he wears them all the time, so that has to say more than any words can. He'd wear these all day if he could.
B00DESW7C4|5|Husband loves it!
B00BLRUH0E|1|From all the good reviews that I read I was excited to buy this jacket at first but I was extremely disappointed when it never came. I waited a full two weeks after the estimated delivery time and it just never got to me. So I was pretty bummed out, especially since it had good reviews on shipping and mine just never got here.
B008X05YQY|5|These only come to the forearm, not to the elbow but that is fine with me. I am taller than average height with long slender arms. Made well and don't look inexpensive which was important to me. Not sure how they launder yet but seem to be wearing well and will update at a later time.  Update: These have laundered extremely well so I have purchased more in other colors! Warm and mostly worn in winter but light enough that you could wear all year round!
B0089PBVJM|5|i love this hat! i'm only 11 and i can wear it easily so you should get it. feels good when you put it on!
B000QW6LKU|4|I like it so far. Only thing is that the straps tend to rub on my arms and that tends to get irritating. Other wise it has the perfect support that I need for my back!
B007VMFUFU|5|Bought this for my 2 year old niece!  It was perfect!  Looks exactly like the photo!  very good quality fabric.  Such a cute BoHo chic dress!
B0098HRGYE|5|These are so cute! They can be worn with almost any toddler girls' top. They can also be worn during any season!
B004MPEKEG|3|they are smaller and less flamboyant than anticipated
B000V0EPKU|5|I bought these scrubs for a CNA class I was taking, as I needed them for clinical rotation and for the state exam. They fit me perfectly as the sizing chart was very accurate. I am very happy with the scrubs.
B00J7BQ0H0|1|I'm highly disappointed because I needed that dress to wear 4/11/15 and then you all sent the wrong size
B00OP2MQVA|5|My HP fan son loved these socks!
B00HJ2GOPC|5|I love these! I bought a couple pairs at Belks & wanted more so I got them on Amazon. They will be comfy even in the summer!
B000MWXBHA|3|A little big and itchy
B00L2TCU7O|5|If they have more colors available, I'm ordering!
B00N72XUBY|4|5'9&#34;/160 /36DD  Bust:40&#34;/Waist:30&#34;/Hips:40&#34; and purchased the 3X based on the MANUFACTURER listed sizing guidelines (normally, I wear L or XL).  The manufacturer says 3X=Chest: 23&#34;.....  It fits PERFECT (use the manufacturer chest size 23&#34;x 2= 46&#34;--which leaves me approx 4-6&#34; of slack around my chest.  The manufacturer measurement is fairly accurate.  Measured straight across the chest of the garment.)<br /><br />**Note:  there is a difference between Amazon's generic 'size chart' and the actual Manufacturer sizing.  The Manufacturer sizing is found under the &#34;Product Description&#34; in bold.<br /><br />You could probably get away with wearing the 3X if you were a little bigger than me.  I am hourglass shaped, so keep that in mind.  It actually is a TUNIC on me and completely covers my backside.  Surprising because I am tall.  It has a high/low hem (shorter in the front) which I like.  The material has a great drape, but will show every freckle, bra-line, and bump underneath.  Keep in mind it is pretty thin.  I deducted one star for the lightweight fabric, but do like the cut of the shirt.<br /><br /> I don't understand people who leave reviews that only say &#34;too small&#34;....it leaves nothing for reference for other buyers.  I hope this review was helpful to your purchasing decision.
B0044QGHS0|1|I cheack my account.. I don't see mony for return this item
B00JIO7STA|5|Love them. They fit and feel good (:
B00I87ITR8|5|Great first bra. I called the store selling it and they were extremely helpful. I would definitely recommend this product. Soft fabric and the elastic is not too tight.
B000GIP95C|3|This is a great brand but sometimes thier sizes run small and it can be hard finding a size that is big enough.
B00CJJ6AXQ|4|Gloves are great. Good condition, although the threading is loosely done, so a buyer may need to apply reinforcement stitching. If you're looking to dye the gloves, good luck, it is largely polyester.
B00739YD6I|5|The dress was arrived on time. The material was quite alright to the style. The lenght was perfect to my knee. This is perfect going to dinner cocktail and church. I'm looked skinny because of the dark purple color.
B00OJONRKI|2|It's very , very thin! Almost see through..otherwise  I like it ok
B005I6TA1Q|5|This top is ultra feminine and super pretty. The color is a cream color and is really pretty. It is comfy and the top does not move around when I'm going swimming. I went up a size in tops since swimsuit material is very tight.
B008OB1010|1|bust to big and rest of the tank too small. this is a poorly designed tank. better off buying the nursing tank at target.com for $20!
B00AMC3SFU|3|The color is nice and bright, but the material is too thin and light.<br />After a couple of washes, it can no longer be worn.
B00FFGQB5C|5|It fits really well and is comfortable. Ive had several people ask me about it. Its my new favorite t-shirt!!!
B00527AGDW|1|Terrible product. Looks nothing, I mean NOTHING, like the picture. Not even close. Super tiny and flimsy. Sheer, yellow, nylon fabric rather than gold. Hoop was twisted and could not be repaired. Could not be worn so it was returned. Don't waste your time.
B003FEMGXC|5|I bought three of these for my wedding groomsmen. Such a beautiful set, a little lighter in person than \\"burnt orange\\" but very nice quality. Beautiful set.
B00MJOJEJS|5|What's in style for my teen son...fits great!
B00DT700UQ|5|The fabric is very soft and comfortable. Nice.
B0038JQYB4|2|Sock is warm but uncomfortable to wear hurts my feet.
B005JQM77Y|5|Very cute and flattering!
B00422MCW6|1|The card slot is not big enough for my ID and is now collecting dust. Not what I would expect.
B005LAMDAE|5|Nice quality materials and perfect true to size, fit.  Has a real vintage look for those who are into that.
B009EKDB2Q|5|i originally bought this entire set for the pants only because it was cheaper than buying just a single pair of seersucker pants. BUT, when i opened it and saw the adorable pink shirt and tie and the little vest, i knew that my kid would definitely be wearing the set for easter!! i bought size 18 months for my 16 month old and it looks like it should fit fine, but we haven't tried it on yet. i think i can mix and match the pieces with other outfits so he will get more wear out of it.
B006WACCKI|1|This is the first purchase I have been unhappy with ever on Amazon. I am 5 foot 7 and wear a size 14. I ordered the size 16  and the pants are in the description as \\"long.\\" I received the pants balled up in a messy knot in an envelope.  Not only were they tight, despite ordering one size up, but the length hit me mid ankle! Waaaaay shorter than  the description and picture imply! Also i agree with the customer who says she couldve bought these for ten bucks at target....material is very cheap. I am returning these.
B003FOBYAI|5|I love this wallet. I used to have a plain burgundy one, and although I can't store all of my cards in it at one time, it does hold everything I need.
B00MZJ2WVE|3|A lot bigger than I expected.  Hope it protects as advertised.
B003X26SDA|5|Very good quality and good style.  Very good construction.  This belt should compliment my wardrobe very well.  Good addition to my wardrobe.
B00KOK8SKU|5|Good
B000CE9FLE|4|The product's quality is very good and apart from the coloring tone (which tends to be greenish in real life unlike the image; -1star), the pants' quality looks and feels very good & solid, the inseam and knee areas are reinforced firmly and I think it will last for a long time, the top & side pockets are spacious too. Another point is the sizing, which is a bit inaccurate (little too large) but the side waist-belts took care of this issue, although it fits & looks good, but it would have looked better if its length sizes were a bit longer for taller people like me (not only regular), so if there were longer sizes (i.e. large long, x-large long, ...etc) it would have been much better, but this one is OK
B00ED7O5FC|5|I have experience with Miracle Suits so I ordered a size larger than usual.  It IS a &#34;compression garment&#34;.  Looks great and is comfortable but understanding sizing is important.
B00D9QW80C|5|Bought for my S.O. as a birthday gift and she wears it constantly. It's discreet enough that it can be worn casually but recognizable enough to fans of the series.
B00FGJFAX2|3|These fit very tight! Yikes! Once I get them on, they eventually stretch out a bit, but it feels like wearing a girdle on my legs. LOL<br />I DO like that they're fleece-lined - extra warmth for an unexpectedly very cold winter here in the Southeast USA. I can layer them with other pants...<br /><br />But they're so SMALL! I expected &#34;Full&#34; to mean must that - I'm large framed, but not THAT large.<br /><br />*sigh*<br /><br />Guess I'll go back to Queen-size tights, that feel comfortable AND have feet...
B00FQBS67M|5|This is my new favorite go to shirt! Great for a night out or a comfy dinner at home! I loved it so much I ordered 2 more! The only issue I had is the t shirt is a bit itchy, but I have a ton of those!
B00I2IHHG2|4|Very nice socks for the price!
B00L53GU6O|5|i love it!! it gives such  a beautiful silhouette. not steel boned, but the boning is perfect.
B0053XF87O|1|It was pose to be cancel but it was send anywaybut I have it in X large and I love it
B00FQGHH9A|5|These were my favorite shorts last summer. Since then, I managed to drop some weight, so I just ordered a new pair a size smaller. These shorts are very comfortable.
B0052RQ3PM|5|liked it
B00N9S6HG6|2|collar puffs up oddly.  fit was as expected, and if it wasn't for the way the hoody made the collar puff up, it would be a great jacket.  I returned it
B0081ZT85O|5|I've owned several pairs of these socks for running and love them.  No blisters or any problems.  I've used them in marathons and a 50k last spring.
B00789UO84|5|Durable, comfortable, and plenty of useful pockets.
B00368CLAK|5|I love this running bra. It is my third one. It is a must have especially if running or doing any other aerobic activity. I will be buying another soon!!
B009EREJ98|5|Delivered as promised. In plastic bag in mailbox. Colors not as pictured. Dark green and lighter gray color weren't in my 6 pack. No matter. Fit as expected. Happy with them
B00D4KKFF8|4|buy it for my daughter in size 5, the pants will stay to the right, but otherwise is good product.
B00B6E78CW|5|Fits great, high quality, heavy T which I like and nice looking to boot. They also have generous tails which allow for some shrinkage.
B00MMW7GP6|4|If you are a small person, this is perfect. Fabric is excellent
B0007UQKNY|5|It looks very nice...so far the zipper works smoothly. ..I definitely would recommend this product to anyone who needs a nice book cover.
B00N2USS5O|5|Love it.
B0006HEMXI|5|Now this product is truly amazing as it does not run and one size fits all. They are soft and very comfortable, not to mention they never creep down and can be worn all day. You won't ever need suspenders; what a joy. I would like to see more colors besides mist and black. Great product and I intend to buy more of them.
B0052HRDL0|5|The only jeans my teen finds that fit well.
B00JH4P80C|4|The shirt is nice for every day wear however it looks dresser in the picture than it is.
B001M51HUY|4|I received this bag for my birthday. It was everything the picture and description portrayed. The main compartment is roomy and holds all of my books and papers. My only concern is the tuck locks are not always easy to open. Other than that, the bag is very durable, and being a school teacher, durability is important. I plan to carry this bag for a very long time.
B00EOHYKFG|5|cute outfit for a little one.
B00LLMA95C|5|Excellent! !
B00FBD2G0I|5|Standard socks. Fit great, feel great, nice thickness.
B00CC6ZQ2M|5|The price of this outfit was so reasonable that I ordered it in two sizes. It's well made, cozy, and really cute on our grandson. Highly recommend!
B00DYVICSO|5|I love the fit and the easy in which I can move in them, They look great and that is at the end of a 12 hour day.
B00VXUQ7F8|1|Very poor quality
B00OLDZIS6|5|I'm excited to give these belts to my sons and sons-in-law in their Christmas stockings this year!  Great product and great selection of colors!  I also love that I don't have to know their exact belt sizes to be able to order this item as a gift!
B001UPXTLQ|5|THE best warm raincoat I've ever had! I work outside in Washington State. So this coat has past all tests with flying colors. Super comfortable with lots of pockets that all my necessities, like phone, reading glasses, notepad, all stay dry.
B00M0QEXJQ|5|great
B000TA529K|5|Very comfortable SockS
B006MQGX16|4|My almost 7 yr old daughter loves these. They fit her great (she's tall and muscular - 48 in and 58 lbs) and the size 8 is perfect for her. She does wish that there were a few more varieties of faces but other than that, love!
B00TQ4QBE0|3|The dress itself is nice; nice length, material flows nice.  However, I'm 5'7, small chested but big everywhere else.  The top was tight over the girls but loose above them and the top was very low.  In the photo, the picture showed wide straps but they get narrower as they move up to the shoulder and down the back.  And the back is much lower than a bra strap.  It just fits strange.  You can't wear a bra with this dress. I ordered another style and we'll see if that one is better but I'll have to return this one.
B00Q1VGHR2|5|good
B00DNUX9FC|5|Nice nice nice, high end quality
B00M8KA8ZM|4|It's great material and looks like the picture but it is a little small. I ordered a medium and I'm 5'5&#34; and 135 pounds and its tight. Definitely gives a muffin top. Order up a size or 2
B00DED5V5Y|5|I think this dress is so pretty. I was really pleased with the quality for the price. It was fuller than I thought it would be which was great. It did fit a teeny bit bigger than I was expecting and it doesn't have a tie in the back or anything to pull it in, but it still fit pretty well on my daughter. We couldn't have gone down a size for sure. This is a great dress, she got so many compliments at the Father Daughter Dance!
B002GHCHQ0|5|Made well and excellent fit, true to size. Nice weight for in between a regular sweatshirt and a heavy coat.
B003YCH55O|5|I wear these socks to work and a  slowly having them replace my old cotton socks. They're comfortable, but provide cushioning and keep my feet dry!
B005GHKIE0|5|My wife just loves this and she is hard to buy for. I will probably purchase again. Update 06/03/2015 My wife wore this Kimono just once. She was to wear it today, and discovered the hem is unraveling. The attached PIC taken today shows the problem very clearly.  I want a return email (mjbilicko@gmail.com) to acknowledge your receipt of this letter, and picture sent you. I want a replacement asap, and need return instructions of the defective Kimono
B00F6NQ03M|5|What can I say about leggings? They are well made...and the price was right.
B007C7XNO4|1|always stealing photos are placed and prducto works or not is not the same as you order, are stealing y
B00K1HPLS8|4|Nicely detailed sweater.  Tighter knit so it won't snag on an active young girl!
B00CTGBNIG|5|Get lots of compliments on the jacket, which is a lightweight sweatshirt type material, it can be worn indoors much like a sweater.<br />The pants are cute, the band at the ankles prevents the pants from slipping down over the child's feet if the pants are a bit long, which is nice.
B00HQNET2O|5|fits good and feels great- looks good for a tshirt
B00IRJV2L2|5|These socks are a joy! Easy to put on, to wear, and no tight tops to cut circulation. Thanks! I was getting tired of having to cut the elastic top of all my other socks.
B004LRO45K|5|This is a very sexy piece. Although it´s one size the fishnet stretches very well and still looks good. Good as a little surprise for your boyfriend/husband.
B00PKQUCF2|1|The cut of material is for the size is misleading
B00XKEB7MI|3|A bit tight it is a fun shoe!
B007GYHOC0|5|This shirt has a great design and fits comfortably. This is the best Fellowship of the Ring shirt design I've seen.
B00HD5IV0Q|5|If you like pentagrams, rainbows, my little pony stuff, egyptian, illuminati and other occultist / historic symbols, you will love this sweater!
B00879KP10|5|A friend was wearing these before Christmas and my husband later remarked to me that he liked them. It took a while to find out the source, hence his receiving them recently. He has worn them about three weeks now--so maybe five times?-- and finds them comfortable, wearing well, launderes well, and they look nice enough to wear with a dress sweater or a sports coat for casual wear. He is a big man and these are cut so that they are not baggy nor tight. A good buy even though they are expensive.
B00JSD73MS|5|I love these tops and bought several colors. Also bought two for my pregnant daughter. Great for before and after baby!!
B0007IQFR2|5|This small wallet fits into my front jeans pocket and holds my credit cards and cash perfectly.  Great color and does what I wanted?
B00BH1NJHC|4|Runs a little small but made the Shamrocks stand out even more
B00DDXGJZG|5|Fits great,  comfortable,  look good.
B0059W68KA|2|It was not clear that these were a &#34;stretch&#34; fabric....the inseam was not accurate (too long), I returned them.
B004OTT2ZM|5|I bought this as a baby gift for a co-worker.  It met my expectations. It is really a cute little baby outfit for a boy.
B00HV62S24|3|More denim blue than in the pic. Very distressed but cute if you're going for that style
B007IDN3EW|5|Satisfied with product quality and delivery.
B00HA93L8W|1|i wanna return back
B00A3VTN1S|5|love it
B000OYF49O|5|Really well made! Great price! Stylish! Leather is very soft! All round good buy!
B000MS6B3K|5|This product is perfect, I have already bought a couple of them, I have not needed to do it anything, you can wear at once because its size is exact, in addition its wool is of quality.    thanks for having available quality products.
B005AVZMZ2|5|I love this tiger tee.  Lucky Brand tees are quickly becoming my favorite and this one is especially nice.  The color and design are very pretty.  The fit is perfect - very flattering. I'm certain I will wear this often.
B00PUWVM28|5|Love this shirt it's amazing!
B00S5FZNYU|5|Everything went well!
B004NP65DO|5|As a guy in the medical filed I dread having to look for new scrubs because for one thing most of them are for woman and the unisex Are always to big so I don't mind paying extra for scrubs that fit me well
B00NAWJ2UY|5|Love this little dress, so complimentary and quality for the price! I opened it, put it on and haven't looked back! Way better in person that in photo! Love Love Love!
B00E0NUGFW|1|Size was not at all like it is stated. Buy 2-4 sizes bigger than what you are!!!
B00HSZ6VBC|4|Carole Hochman makes pretty good quality sleepwear, and this was no exception.<br /><br />The gown is very lightweight, perfect for summer.  It is comfortable, and best of all it washed well.  ;)<br /><br />I took off one star because I feel $45 is a bit much for what you get here...just a gown.  Still, it is good quality, and I do like her stuff.
B00NLDRPMY|5|super cite
B00LBCB1K4|5|Great
B0007R07Y0|5|Bought 2 - one for myself and one for a friend.  We both love the texture and the color.
B00MLLNISM|5|Dis good
B00FA7G08E|1|Looks nice in the picture but Fell apart after wearing it one time. Not worth buying at all! Waste of my money and time.
B003E327FQ|5|Love my cap,fits good,feels great and now all the women want me more! Its on the top as far as quality and cost goes, all around good deal!
B00BZE5YV0|5|The coat fits exactly as expected.  Looks great on and I have received many compliments! Would recommend this coat to my friends.
B007U3J26S|3|I did not realize this was a costume wig. It's a fun cool looking wig. I suppose it would be fun to wear for a-couple of months, here and there.<br />Avg fit. fits good, think it would fit large also. The auburn, browns and blondes are really great and the twisted dreads are also great.  I would love this wig if it was a remy or capless wig for like $35.00.
B00K44JLCU|4|what I was looking for
B003N24ZOO|5|I rarely write reviews but I had to on this product. I've had this belt for over a year and 3 months and I wear it practically every day and it's still going strong. I thought that by this time it would have cracked and peeled by now but it hasn't. It's a great belt. You won't be sorry when you purchase it.
B00BIQWEBI|5|Got these to wear with a black sweater. Very soft. I get compliments on this scarf every time I wear it!
B002WLVBOE|5|Good quality tie. my husband and I matched at the party.  Comes well packaged
B0009G9SPI|2|The brief description of this shirt reads cotton. It does not read cotton/polyester blend. This shirt is not 100% cotton. The polyester content is over 10% (the print on the shirt is difficult to read, but the polyester content is double digit - so the content is a minimum 10% polyester).<br />If you are looking for a 100% cotton shirt - go elsewhere. I am not a fan of polyester and would not have purchased this item had I known the actual content.
B00HLQ8UGC|1|The shirt looked great but is made of incredibly thin material. After 1 washing the fabric pilled.  This was an expensive t - shirt and it's something that can only be worn a couple of times.
B00CI9AZOC|5|I like this sweater. Like the length, the style, its warm and I like the button style. I was a little worried it would be too big as I've read a lot of reviews that complained about that. But it fit nicely and was what I would expect in an extra large. I think this is a true XLg. Some items you buy now days (made in China or some other place) claim to be XLg and are on the small side so I think some people have gotten used to things running smaller.    I feel a little dressier now when I wear this instead of my usual zip up fleece Colombia jackets or Russel hoodie jackets. I would have given 5 stars except for the fact that they don't give you any extra buttons! I was rather surprised at that. Most shirts & sweaters include at least one extra button in case you lose one. If that happens with this sweater, I'll have to change them all as they did not provide one. :(    EDITED: I found the extra button attached to the inside label. So scratch my criticism. 5 stars. :)
B006ZS96K6|4|These are a standard go-to for me. Hadn't bought any in a while. Wish they had posted the inseam. I'd have ordered the petite. Now I have to have them hemmed. Short still has an inseam of 29&#34;. Warning to the vertically challenged.
B00LPQ6P5W|5|I got a med the other pants I ordered fit well but these seem a little tight.
B00D2LWIKE|1|This dress was not flattering at all.  I'm quite tall.  It looked like a paper bag.  Not impressed.  A burlap sack would have been more complimentary.
B003DA5TLO|1|I order XL and got S  bulls*** !
B00K4WMK3O|5|great boxers great fit and arrived on time love these boxers
B00BV2VNY8|5|This dress fits perfect and it was made very well.
B0009KWQ6M|5|Its hard to know just what to expect from some online \\"deals\\". However, My experience with Amazon, in the past, has been very positive.  The anorak I ordered arrived on time and was much better than expected.  The fabric was more substantial than anticipated, the fit was perfect and the rain just doesn't get through.  I'm very happy with the manufacturer, the price and Amazon.
B00HHOXQXU|4|very warm. should have bought a size smaller (XL). I was under the impression they were built for the Asian body type.
B00CXQEXNO|5|Arrived today after 11 days.<br />it's more darker that i was expected, but still I'm very happy with this purchase.<br />I saw that many people wrote about that you need to purchase a size smaller that you usually use, but i purchase XL and i'm 178cm and 80kg and it fit excellent for me :D
B009XDFBZ4|5|I bought three of these for my kids - they absolutely love them and they are so warm!
B00265AXX6|5|We all could not stop laughing! Especially as Jabba started dancing to Katy Perry
B005TS2Q46|5|A+!
B0089FT8LA|5|Everything ok!!!
B009UU90YS|5|Beautiful fit, beautiful color, beautiful style. It's looks great on our little girl. Excellent quality and uniquely designed. It is well worth the purchase.
B00EMG3VMC|4|Cute and lightweight. Fit in the range but seems a tad smaller than some comparables in length, not a lot. May have shrunk to make the difference.
B001INCSJO|1|3x Dont think so! I wear a size 18 read that it ran small so I ordered big! This sweater didn't fit my size ten daughter! Maybe it was sized incorrectly? Was very cute just tiny!
B00HWIAOH2|5|perfect condition and exactly as described
B00D4KH96G|5|Very pretty. Fits my 4 year old grandaughter perfectly. It's been washed several times and is holding up well.
B008L56XWU|5|I absolutely love this scrub top! It is very fitted and shows your curves without being too tight. The fabric is just the right amount of thickness. I wasn't sure exactly what size to order but I ended up getting a small and it fit perfectly. I'm 5'9&#34; and 143. I don't like things to fit tight and I really like the way this top fits. I will definitely order another one.
B00IABNC38|5|Bought as a Christmas gift for my 10 year old. She absolutely loves it!
B007VQNFNK|3|I was hoping for a heavier weight.  It very hard to do on-line.
B0078X20RS|4|they fit as described and look perfect on top of my pointe shoes. i really like them. I would buy again
B00H3Q4SL6|5|Very elegant. Worth the money.
B001OQIOZ2|5|I didn't expect this sweater to be as nice as it is. It's cute, comfortable and just the right weight to wear anytime. The color I got (vine/berry) is great and it is just a terrific purchase. I would highly recommend this sweater!
B002HRFARW|5|I was shopping for christmas presents, adn found this dress. I always wanted a one shoulder dress, so I decided to get it. Even though I rate this fivestars, there are of course, problems I had with it. These are important for you to know. The lining of the dress is tighter than the dress itself, so don't be fooled. It is not as short as it looks. Also, the image doesn't represent it well. Other than that, it is a great dress. The pin on the shoulder comes off, so you can dress it up or down. The color is a fabulous irish green. I wanted to put leggings with it, but unforunately, because of the fabric, the leggings stick. I like the support in the top. I don't feel like my breasts will fall out. If you like this sort of thing, buy it now!!!
B006SCSV1E|3|didn't fit me right
B009W49T34|4|The fork and spoon come apart into two separate utensils, then snap back together for storage.  It cleans easily with little hassle.
B00HW9ZITU|2|Sorry, but I didn't like them.
B00JEDVVK2|5|Fun shirt.  Gets lots of questions, which really is the point.
B002R0F79A|1|The one I bought is 2-4 my daughter is tall but very tiny she wears a 3t . this leotard just fits her most likey won't fit once I was it :-(
B004445AUS|5|I love fit too nice
B004WI2EUA|5|This was my first purchase of skinny jeans I was a little scared to purchase them online, when they arrived they fit great and for my first pair I'm so glad they weren't so tight around the legs I couldn't get them on. I ordered a size 8 and they fit fine. Very happy with my purchase.
B00T9KO10M|5|Size xl is a size 16.
B00L40NTL2|4|For the deal of the day price, this coat was a steal.  I really like the way it fits and the color is great. I have long arms and the arms on this coat were perfect.
B00PZAC1WU|4|Very good quality, but slightly larger size
B007MY656A|5|i like i like this fix good and feel goodvery nice
B001JQLPGC|5|Love these bras always have problems find a good bra and these fit really good and very comfortable will be ordering more
B008VJDVJ4|5|Bought these for my wife and love the look.  The fabric is great and looks and feels comfortable on her.  I will definitely buy more of these.
B00FM9GYS6|2|First off, I *love* eBags's packing cubes. The &#34;small&#34; and &#34;slim&#34; size cubes are absolute travel favorites. But the &#34;large&#34; size is, well just too large! When packed full (or even semi-full), they are floppy, sloppy and generally unwieldy. Right now I'm using my large cubes for off-season clothing storage, inside a very firm container. I cannot imagine using these for travel since they'd use up more space with their unavoidable lumpiness than they'd save with compression. And they're really too large to be useful for organization either, except at home where you might actually have 14 pairs of jeans to load into one cube. I can only imagine they'd be organizationally useful for travel if multiple people were sharing one suitcase and wanted to separate out their entire trip wardrobes.
B00HUS6ZHC|5|my mom says its very comfy so yeah i love it!
B004IRKJTS|1|If you're a size 14/16, this product would probably work fine. If you're 18 or larger, it's a shirt. It doesn't even reach my hips. I tried to keep it down by attaching them to thigh highs, but the garter clasps are so cheap that they fell apart every time I tried.  And the tie curled up like a cartoon. Such a waste of money!
B00J9KQGCS|5|exact color i needed
B00V8TG2IG|5|Shirt looks as its shown on the picture and fits perfectly
B00LGMFW2M|5|Bought this for my wife (5'5&#34;, 115 lbs, slim and long torso).......it fits her perfectly.  The shirt has flare to it that accents her body nicely, while still being comfortable.  It is a soft material and she's only had it for a week so I can't comment on durability.  Can't beat it for the price.  It is an odd color gray though, but plan on buying more for her.
B00P3F46AW|5|Nothing but good things to say my wife needed it fast it came quick as could be we appreciate that and fit just right looks great.
B0032YVLAY|5|Can't go wrong with Dickies. Always fit perfect for work or play.
B004A7XXIA|3|Good Coverage, cool colors, could be softer cotton. The seams on either side of the hip are too thick. Panty lines through certain pants and would especially show if you wear tight jeans/ leggings/ pants/ skirts. Also if too tight, underwear or pants, the seams can get on comfortable on either side of the hip.
B00AJLM8JQ|5|these are just as described and fit really well
B00DQZ3Y8Q|3|I appreciate the packaging and that it was delivered on time. I am quite dissapointed with the color- photo looks like an off-white/cream colored thus I ordered it but its gray. The stainless steel noted is gray/silver.
B00KGE4B3M|3|Having put on a few pounds in the last year, I was looking to update my wardrobe with some new jeans. I picked these jeans because they are &#34;trouser style&#34; and therefore have a wider opening at the bottom, because I have wide calves.<br /><br />I was disappointed to see that the fabric on these jeans is very thin. Definitely not the type of denim that I would want to be wearing in the winter -- in fact, I would probably characterize these jeans as being appropriate for 50 degrees (F) and above, but not for anything below 40 (unless you're wearing another layer under them).<br /><br />I was also frustrated by the sizing on these jeans. I ordered them in a 6 short, thinking that I would need that size due to my weight gain (I used to wear a 2/4). Nope, the 6 Short was huge on me, and in particular, was way too big in the crotch area, which left a very large gap between where the fabric creased on my thighs and the seat.
B00S2X1C2M|5|These pants fit perfectly! I am just under 5'3 and 115 lbs I ordered a size 3. I love the softer light material of these too. I will order other colors!
B00H8O9GGA|1|Was so small that I couldn't even get them on. Normally a medium but would have had to get an xxl just to put them on.
B00IJAZ9W2|4|The color was slightly faded.  The print was good quality.
B00FHO6VG6|5|This shirt is really soft and fun. I like it!
B00PW0CF9W|5|Very beautiful dress and it fit perfect. I would be wearing it to a 1920's wedding in Las Vegas and I have all the accessories to go with it. I order a large and I wear a size 12 dress. Very good material and it don't look cheap I would be ordering again and I will recommend it to  friend.
B00M52AS1C|5|She loves it
B0088280EK|5|these babys are hot i love them they are low rise like it says so dont take that lightly very fast shipping and exactly as described
B000G73P4A|3|Too large to me.
B00OOE1ZUC|5|It is just spot-on.
B00005C0JJ|3|Do not buy things like this from here - as above, shipping costs were relaly high and could have just been stuck in normal first class post for a fraction of the cost!!!
B009325FHE|4|It's a nice blouse and it lays the way it should (as shown in the picture). It's thin material though. I tried it on last night. Good thing it's black! I'm still awaiting the arrival of the beige colored one. My order says delivered on Amazon but I have not received it. I'll review the lighter color once it is received so you'll know just how sheer or revealing the top may be.<br /><br />Edit - I received the beige blouse 2 days after the Amazon site stated \\"delivered\\". Not cool. Anyway, the beige version of this shirt is even worse. I won't be wearing for a while. The thinness is more prevalent due to the light color of the blouse. It's showing all the extra fat I'm trying to lose. LOL Seriously though, the shirt is so thin that you can see my navel imprint. That's too thin. These blouses are almost $30 each so they could stand to spend a little more on fabric. Overall, I give the blouses a 3.5 out of 5 stars.
B010W1HXS8|5|Fast shipment and perfectly pigmented shirt! Highly recommended!
B004H4CGRU|4|great product
B0006FMIKE|5|I just returned from Italy. I slung this pouch all over. It carried my passport, money, and small panasonic high video camera plus a tiny tri-pod. I had easy access, but not so easy, any one could open it in crowds. I was very happy with it. Personally, I'd like to see it just tiny bit bigger.
B006W5O22E|5|Love it haven't worn it much but looks sexy, Girls Dig it too! best worn with a blazer of course.
B00HDA3LLA|5|Very well made and the fact that it is double material is a plus.
B00A0SR5EG|5|My daughter in law was delighted with this tee shirt and wore it all summer.  She's a big girl and would ordinarily wear an XL, but this was roomy enough for her. Surprising this tee held up really well thru many washings.
B006Z8G51O|5|Vibrant color, great feel, light weight, better than I expected. Will get a lot of use out of this shirt.
B000EN4E64|5|I have hips approx 40 inches around and I ordered the size 15/16 which fit me perfectly. If you have more of a bubble type of butt unlike me then be sure to order a size up to fit all of your booty in these because they do not stretch. These pants are very cute, stiff at first so they need to be washed a few times to soften them up. The fabric is also a little bit uncomfortable at first but that wears off. They sit a tiny bit low on the hips so be sure to wear a belt or a shirt that will cover your behind when sitting down. Overall these are very cute and sexy capris that you will be very pleased with.
B00NQFJC9Q|3|fits smaall
B0041OFBNC|3|The description says its one size so I purchased the robe. However it arrived as a medium. I am 6' tall and weigh 250 pounds. Its a little tight and is almost too short. I do like it tho and will keep it. A large would have been perfect :/
B00NIN0CXQ|4|I had the best looking ugly x-mas sweater at our party.
B00BJN6DOY|5|I LOVE these leggings. Perfect fit. When I fist got them, I did notice after a little while that by the crotch area that little cat ball things formed, but they aren't noticeable. Other that, these are great quality and I'm buying more right now.
B001H0FX0Y|5|Been wearing Levi's 501 for at least 45 years. Will always love them.
B00FOSEUMW|5|Seemed a little big when first opened package; however, upon wash in warm water, they fit exactly right. If they had been smaller at the start, they would've been too small after washing.
B00K5T533K|5|My Grandson was so pleased with his Champion Men's Athletic Hooded. He has bragged on his gift. His wife said he wore it all the time and that I made a good choice. I give all the credit to Amazon. I am always pleased with Amazons produts.
B000HAMITE|5|It looks to be a really nice costume for the price. Looking forward to using it!
B005LBHXK8|5|I love this hat. It is everything I expected and more. I wear it all time. I'm tempted to buy it in the other colors as well!
B00FTZGK8C|3|Somewhat small
B00NIKZ0PY|5|My daughter got this for Christmas and loves them. They are soft and wash well.
B00HME09JY|5|HAve use it a few times and still like new!
B00BI4YZBW|5|I got my item very quickly sooner the expected . I am very pleased with the bows  thanks so much!
B001IA4P7A|5|Nice and warm
B00OYSUNB0|4|I weight 126 pounds and size b on bras. I bought a small and the top fits very good, the bottom was too small for me, it doesnt cover my butt well. It is a very sexy bikini, I would recomend to a friend.
B00MBW401A|4|ran a little small.
B00FPSZOQW|5|nice fabric
B00G8W070C|1|Wrong socks plus they arent real huf dont buy from judier
B00J8C80WG|5|Great fit looks good on. The dress was a soft cool material and looks better than expected. I have really enjoyed wearing it. It is great for Church or Casual wear.  Received quite a few compliment. Ruth
B000TFFPGK|4|I got these socks for an 8 hour spelunking trip this past weekend in Tumbling Wild Rock Cave. I have had good experiences with Smart Wool brand socks in the past, but none of them were Amazon Prime eligible, so I went with these instead (partially on the basis of the excellent reviews).<br /><br />The night that I got these, I decided to wear them around just to test them out. The seams in the toes are delightfully non-existent; I couldn't feel a seam at all. As I took them off to go to bed, however, I noticed a significant amount of wear of the bottom of the socks. I had only worn them to walk to the bathroom once that night, but it wasn't a huge deal, particularly given the price being so much lower than Smart Wool products I had grown to love.<br /><br />During the course of the trip I stepped in puddles well past my ankle (I suppose that'd be a pool, not a puddle) and wore brand-new, and thus un-broken in, boots. My feet felt dry almost immediately and I never felt discomfort from the socks. The terrain was so bad and the climbing was fairly intense, but my feet never felt sweaty nor cold in the 58 degree cave.<br /><br />Overall, I would definitely recommend these, but probably not for wearing around the house.
B00MV6IY5Y|5|These are freaking adorable!!! Very durable and there is a color for every outfit!!
B00GV2HN06|4|The material is light and loose which equal comfortable.  It is professional enough to wear for work but trendy enough to pair with some tight jeans, shorts, or skirt to wear out.
B00SB3T00Y|5|I love these bibs! They are cute and soft. Made of cotton so can get soaked with saliva.
B00NP7ZTEM|3|Cute but small, my daughter is this size and it's slightly tight as well as short she has to wear other pj pants because of how short it is. More like a longer top
B001KSTWUA|5|This item actually shipped from Technology Galaxy. The service was very prompt and the package arrived in good condition. The bag itself is perfect for traveling with the iPad - it holds the iPad (which is in the flip book case from Apple), the charging plug & cable, the video adapter and a microfiber cleaning cloth. The padding in the case is thick enough to protect the iPad without making the whole thing too bulky. One note: for my purposes the bag holds exactly what's needed, but there isn't much room to spare. You could probably fit your cell phone in there but if you want something that also holds file folders and other office-related detritus, you'll want to look at something a little bigger.
B005GPVXAU|1|Not only too large, but huge.
B00K5AKI02|4|Nice Bifold, I would buy again. Thank you.
B00140BI7Y|1|I bought this case for my new TomTom Go 720.  The case itself is fine (a little cheaply made), however my biggest beef is that the case is too small for this particular GPS unit.  If you're looking for an inexpensive case for your TomTom Go 720, this is not it!
B00FYEVPJM|5|Fits well, and a cute compression sock
B00MRQQ8E2|5|Great
B005GV446Y|5|This belt is full grain, and perfectly smooth with no scars or imperfections.  That is a big deal when buying plain belt since tooling can hide a multitude of sins.  Also, the belt has no layers or glued up pieces.  It is one continuous piece of leather.  I think I have not owned any belt this nice in all my years with the possible exception of a belt my friend made (hand tooled) for me in my college days.<br /><br />Here are some leather basics I looked up on the web...<br /><br />Full-Grain Leather vs. Top-Grain Leather<br /><br />The strongest and most durable part of the hide of an animal is just below the hair. The grain pattern in this part of the hide is very tight, and the leather made from here is called \\"full-grain\\" leather. Full-grain leather is the strongest and most durable leather. Additionally, since the grain is so tight, it resists moisture very well. Over time, full-grain leather will look nicer and nicer and develop a patina from being handled.<br /><br />The next best--and second strongest--leather is called \\"top-grain\\" leather. Top grain leather is similar to full-grain leather, except that the top couple millimeters have been sanded and buffed to take away imperfections. With the top layer removed, the leather will have a more uniform finish, but it won't be as durable--and it will break down much faster. This is more of a \\"cookie cutter\\" leather that most leather wallets and handbags are made of, which lends to their generic appearance. Top-grain leather can be good leather, but its strength and durability is not even close to the strength of full-grain leather.
B0026S05C2|5|I have received compliments from wearing these every single day i've worn them. You can wear them even when it is dark outside because the lenses are lightly tinted. 5 out of 5 overall.
B007RZBLZO|5|I bought two of these; one for my girlfriend and one for me.  She not only liked hers, but it helped with some thumb and joint pain she has been experiencing.  The copper seems to be helping her, so she is now wearing both of them.  And they look great.  I would recommend this to any 105th Anniversary owner such as myself.
B00VN7BKZI|5|Very cute. Colors are great. Material is a bit thin but that's to be expected. The fit is somewhat small, considering I'm 5'3 125lb and usually wear medium--this time I'll have to return for a large. I'll probably order more of the other colors.
B00ENCGJ24|5|Love this dress!
B005HJ7EQW|2|I bought my size but they were just way too tight.  After a wash it was obvious that my groin would not be capable of withstanding the punishingly small space available. They were what they are supposed to be but just not for me.
B00CU5LOHG|4|The fit is pretty snug but that is okay. I bought this for my first cosplay, Jill Valentine. It should work for that. Good price too.
B003U0BZ7E|3|I got a size 2X and them weren't even close to fitting me. I ended up giving them to this little girl that is probally a size 10 and they fit here great. Then I got them they were maybe a little to young for me anyways. So be careful is size if you are a bigger girl.
B006Z4OODO|3|I bought one size too big so my 5-year-old could wear it again next summer, but it fits pretty tight.<br />It works well now, but won't get to use next year.<br />Shipped on time and overall, great for the price.
B00PEAC0QI|3|Fun shirt to wear. Great gift idea.
B00H2SEC1Q|4|The main part of the sock is acrylic knit. If you don't wash them inside out you run the risk of lots of little pills all over the outside which is rather unattractive. They are great socks, though, stay up well and keep feet warm.
B00OJP2BSQ|5|I got this for my grandma and she loves it! It keeps her warm in the mornings. Not so good after you shower. But great to keep you warm.
B00IKAIEWS|4|This underwear is pretty thin. It feels good
B00MGNQ17A|5|This is a great price and the workmanship is amazing. What a deal.
B009AS2AMY|5|My review is based only on how it fits my son and the quality of the fabric, he hasn't worn it yet, but he tried it on and looks very cute on him. There's room for growth, so it will probably fit tighter to an older baby (mine is 6 months, about 16 pounds).  I liked the colors and the zipper at the bottom to change diapers easily without removing the whole outfit :).
B009LLTMKS|5|ok
B008AABRPO|4|This cape is a bit transparent and not a great quality cape, but look at the price. For a last minute Dr. Fate costume that had a budget, it was just the thing.
B00AAHA7RE|5|Bought this jacket before my first backpacking trip. It can compress very small into my pack and is very breathable as it says. On one of the days it rained for 24 hours straight and it didn't let a drop through while still keeping me cool with the breathable material.<br /><br />It is a great jacket from a reliable brand that I know will hold up for many years and many adventures!
B00KB5ILVY|5|Love the cushioned foot of these socks so much I reordered 6 more pair!
B001UK41PY|5|Gave as gift. She said she loved it and was very happy with the wolf on the t-shirt.
B000NHNXAY|3|Perfectly good for what it is.  Not as long as I would have hoped, but comfortable.   EA
B0027IWRSQ|3|Fair quality
B00319B4CK|5|Cheap but very nice wig for dress-up or cosplay.  Not a wig for everyday use.
B002KEXWU4|5|Sexy but they don't stay up in intense action.... I guess we need a garter belt  if not just in photos hahaaa Otherwise they they are fantastic!!!!
B00FZM81HW|5|Very soft fabric, well put together, big enough to wrap around once or twice, no obvious seam like some infinity scarves have. The one thing I'd warn about is that it is more of a bright orange (like what hunters wear) than a burnt orange - for me, that actually worked better, but if you're looking for a true reddish/burnt orange, you may be disappointed.
B000VQY28E|1|I have a Barbour jacket that is less than one year old and have been told it is \\"beyond renovation\\" by Barbour because of traces of mildew. I had always wanted one of these jackets and against my better judgment went ahead and bought one. So basically I paid a lot of money for a jacket that cannot be worn in the rain and certainly cannot be worn in harsh conditions. I treat this jacket no different than others and they have no problems. (actually not true- I gave this the \\"special care\\" it requires which is ridiculous in itself.)    These are marketed as \\"sport\\" and \\"field\\" jackets. Well I guess that means a ride out to the field in your coach to check on the servants. Maybe a cocktail party in Manhattan to discuss your outing. It is certainly not a functional piece of equipment.    My brother has a 40 year old Filson if you like this waxed look. I also have a 15 year old Australian Outback oilskin which I have used horse riding in every kind of element with no problems. Look into these others or just call LL Bean or Cabelas and save yourself a couple hundred bucks.     This jacket is a Jaguar. Looks great, fancy rep- piece of overpriced junk. My mistake- don't make the same one.
B00HKSSBYC|4|Nice product
B00B5DW5QS|3|If you weld or use a blow torch for a living at all. This is not a good under shirt. trust me on this one. It is warm wicks moisture away. great shirt but it dose not like hot stuff.
B00UMD0VO0|3|Somewhat small
B00EFJKIYK|5|Spice Fontana print is an absolutely gorgeous pattern with lots of purple in it, which is not really visible from the photo. The material feels great on the skin and transforms in a lovely way. It will take you a little practice to tie it in a way that doesn't show the back side of the fabric (which is not printed), but once you get the hang of it, you'll love it. However, its seems that some dresses differ in quality -- it's worth mentioning that I also ordered this dress in the Aqua Renaissance print, which was a noticeably thinner fabric and the color in the photo was a bit off from reality (more sky blue and less vivid turquoise).
B0063CQ9SG|5|My little girl practically lives in this dress!!  I am thankful that I ordered it a size bigger then she wears as it runs a little small.  The dress washes well and has not shrunk at all.
B00CAWGX70|5|I got a lot of Wows while wearing  this tie lots if smiles too
B00BU9QPJA|5|Cute tee.
B00GOAP5BY|4|Love it! Not much paraphanlia for showing Day Trader pride. This is a perfect and high quality T-shirt. Thank you shirtmandude!
B005N3DP6U|5|I got this wig in two days for a Rarity cosplay. It is amazing and looks very real. It is shiny too! I would strongly recommend getting this wig.
B00CI79FRM|5|Im hoping for a zombie apocalypse just so I can flaunt this tab even more! I live in NYC & get compliments on it all the time. Fast shipping time too!
B00DHKY7M2|5|On the banks of the Red Cedar, There's a school that's known to all; Its specialty is winning, And those Spartans play good ball; Spartan teams are never beaten, All through the game they fight; Fight for the only colors: Green and White.
B00CKBY6X4|5|Nice cap, little large on the size but OK, I am a 7 5/8, to give you a idea.
B000H663OE|4|The Wig looked amazing, but was large and in charge. I was looking for something that look a bit more natural
B001A84TIU|4|Fit nicely, but I felt it was a little low cut in the armpits.  Showed off your bra.
B0072LC82I|2|too small
B00A8OUDBY|3|Just bought this sweater and it feels like a cheap sweater I could get from Walmart for under 20 bucks. I Also bought a Spreadshirt, SOULMATE - Left, Men's Hooded Sweatshirt. I wanted them both to be grey so I got a Ash for the male and a Heather Grey for the female. They are completely different shades of grey so... I'm kind of disappointed. This was a gift to match my girlfriend and I for Christmas. The shirts also smell like fresh dill pickle. So, overall I would of thought this sweater would of been made of better material for it's price and I wished the colors actually matched.
B0033HMNNY|5|I orderd these T-shirts for my husband for Christmas and they are great! They fit well and hold up very well after many washings! I highly recommend these t-shirts!
B004YO7H3G|5|es sumamente es exactamente lo que requeria,  lo recomiendo ampliamente . vino todo completo y sin nigun problema. very nice.
B00HG8TZCS|5|this skirt is adorable! i bought it for my granddaughter who is 11 so it isnt a mini but thats ok! she wears it with tights & dress shoes for dressy look or leggings & tennies & tee for casual! i love that the animal print is actually flocked (or at least seems to be)!! we love it!!
B008BHKEO6|5|I bought this for a friend and had my husband try it on when it arrived.  My husband wanted to keep it for himself!<br />Had bought him a coat at an expensive store several years ago and he liked the London Fog better.  But it was a gift for a friend and we did give it to him.  Just to day got to see him and he said that not only did the coat fit but he was delighted with the way it looked.<br />Sorry, at that price, that I did not get 2...
B0043WHVDA|5|Can't say enough LOVE Words about this bra... I have worn it every day since it arrived... tossed my old ones and will wear these for day, night, working out.... ALL THE TIME!!!  I LOVE the way it feels like it is part of me... I never have to adjust it... and it washes up nicely... unbelievable how much I love this!  SO glad I stumbled upon it one day... it is much more than a &#34;sports bra&#34; - and the absorbent material helps prevent that &#34;rash&#34; I get with underwire.... thank goodness for Lily of France!!!
B009Y0EARQ|5|They come from Hong Kong I believe, but did they ship it fast! It took less than 2 weeks!! They are really well made for the price. Beats going out and spending $20-40 a tie.
B00EP3XKLE|5|The company notified me during the Christmas rush all were under that my item would be late, personally, which was amazing to me they took the time to do so. My son LOVED the item as well which says a GREAT deal as his taste does not always coinside w mine.. Great item, wonderful value, amazing customer service! Nothing but a trifecta of happy!!
B000RN6KN6|2|This is a demi-cup version of the full-cup style I really want/need.  But, I am still puzzled by the inconsistency I am finding in the fit of the various Le Mystere styles.<br /><br />The full-cup in the Tisha style (Oprah bra) is way too large in a &#34;C&#34; cup, yet its tight band is just right for my barely 32 torso.  While the lace Tisha fits in a &#34;C&#34; cup, but isn't quite as tight around the torso, and tends to slip up my back.  Yet, this style is way, way too little coverage in a &#34;C&#34; cup (less than a demi-bra), and the band hardly made the first set of hooks.  So, was it the style or a mis-labeled bra.  What I need is an Oprah bra in a 32B, but Le Mystere doesn't offer it in that size.
B00563ONHM|5|Bought these to replace a lost set of gloves that seemed almost identical. The fur is full, fluffy, conspicuous and the overall quality is very nice.
B0051HFI4A|1|These underwear came in really nice colors and the waist band is just broad enough. The material is also nice and soft so I gave 3 stars. The sizing was a big disappointment as I ordered according to the size chart but they turned out to be slightly big. Also the material seems like it may stretch out with time. I'm 110 lbs with a hip size of 37&#34; so I ordered a 6. A size 5 would have been a better fit. I shall still wear these at home only. I feel they are not worth the price for me so I shall not purchase these again. Update: These really stretch out after a few washes so much so, they fit like slacks. What a waste of money.
B0052MXLHA|3|this dress looks amazing. However, you have to be tall with big boobs to pull it off. My wife is an 8, but with hips and butt. The dress made her look frumpy. We sent it back, which we hated to do because it was truly a beautiful dress.
B001FAZ1TE|4|everything seems to be good.
B00CLSPESC|5|deliverd on time, fits perfectly, and seems to do a really good job keeping the heat of the sun off my head/scalp<br />very pleased with it so far which is a short time.  Glad I took the chance
B000MXKMFS|4|Fit was a bit small but I still like these pants. They look good and wear well.
B0051U18NW|4|Gifted
B00DN1CQKK|5|Nice shirt. I just got a size too big..
B00WWODOBY|5|Thanks for trying to send it but I will order again
B0014CAF9Y|4|Probably the most comfortable underwear I have right now.  Soft cotton and stretchy material make for a good combo! Good job putting these together.
B00MF9O8T8|2|These \\"3-in-1\\" gloves are awful. The knit is too loose to be useful and covered in picked out threads, the fingers are super long and the arm warmers are tissue thin and unattached to the gloves. There's no insulation whatsoever. The headband is soft and warm, but so weirdly wide that it can't cover your ears without sticking straight up from the crown of your head.
B00KUNN0FY|5|looks great
B00LAYN1H4|5|Great that's all I can say
B00WYJXJJE|1|What a piece of junk! First of all this item is not silicone. It is made of plastic and therefore you cannot press the tummy for phrases from the movie. When you press the head for the light you hear something that is supposed to say &#34;I love you.&#34; This seller has grossly misrepresented this item which would have been cute if it were what was described.
B008CG4J1A|5|Great price, good size, and good shape. I'm going to be wearing it with a feather fascinator for my wedding ceremony. Mine wasn't wrinkled, it straightened as soon as I took it out of the box.
B00774HCMG|5|Good quality, good fit, very fast delivery.
B00E4WFGBI|3|These are much thinner than the Jeffries socks I buy for my boys, and have less stretch. They also run small. The quality seems lower than the naartjie socks my daughters have. I won't be buying them again.
B00ZIUI0NQ|4|This thigh shaper is great overall. It does fit just a bit smaller than expected but it's still wearable. I purchased it for an issue I know my plus size girls will be sympathetic to. Sometimes, when wearing a dress, you need a little buffer in the thigh area to prevent rubbing and chafing. This seems perfect for that. And it's not so thick that it'll be too hot.
B00KMD3R5A|4|The product came in time. Looks just like the picture. I usually wear between a small and medium for shirts, went small for the skirt though bc I am 5 foot 3.. Fits well
B004WOBVDA|4|Excellent product.
B00BXP1XY8|5|thanks, great product
B005CSNVQK|5|After shopping for workout capri length pants at local clothing stores, I was discouraged with the high prices, low riding waist band and just poor fit. I have some basic Champion pieces that I've had for years so I took a chance and ordered two of these online. Champion has made this great workout capri for those of us who are going to the gym...because we need to. The firmness of the fabric holds everything in place, no bulges, easy to pull on and looks pretty darn great. It is easier to put on your work out clothes and get going when you can look good too. I wear a size 10 women's pant and the medium is a perfect fit.
B00AOW2WN2|5|Loved the retro look of this shirt.  A very nice fitting ladies tee that makes me feel superhero sexy.  Fits as would be expected in the tighter women's style.  Happy with this purchase.
B003NX8CB0|4|Good quality, good price.
B007HON6T4|4|If there had been any smaller size I'd have exchanged it for a size that fit;  but that was not an option.  Otherwise, it appears to be a good quality, well-tailored skirt.
B0059358NM|5|Bought this umbrella for our 2-yr old. He loves it & if there is the slightest drizzle he wants to use his umbrella outside.<br />Well made & I see it growing with him for the next couple of years.
B0052YFZHW|5|Love the these Ahh bras ,  it is great
B002H01NSO|5|This costume is hilarious. I'm 6 feet 2 inches tall and the costume wasn't tight at all. The shorts are definitely short, but they really aren't tight at all. Definitely worth the buy.
B00J8RIBDE|4|my wife likes .
B0079MHB90|3|While the size fit my daughter just fine the ribbon tie on them was too short, she used a ribbon off a pair of tap shoes from when she was three or four years old instead since it was longer and easier to tie.
B00C9HE5VW|4|Very comfortable and easy to put on.  But, they run very long.  Only order long if you are very tall.<br />In regular size they were just right.  Bought a second pair immediately.
B002XXRW58|5|The shawl is as described. It is soft and has a shine to it. Solidly made and finished fabric. Very nice.
B00H02ZDT4|5|I haven't used it much but place it in the passenger side on the visor and have not had any problems with it sliding around like the other reviews  claimed.  It holds my iphone6plus securely as I drive.  Like I say, I have not have any passengers to exclaim how it blocks their view but it doesn't block mine and I don't have to keep my visor up all the time to accommodate it. so far,  It has soft padding to eliminate scratches while the phone is mounted and adjusts for the width of your phone,  I would recommend this product to a friend.
B000JJG90M|3|These pant started slightly small and shrank further on washing  Length is short.
B00H4FGBDO|1|I am 6 &#34;1&#34; and around 165 pounds, I normally wear a L or XL in a shirt like this.  I ordered the 2XL, as I read they ran small, but small is an understatement.  This 2XL fit like a medium at best, and was about 3-4 inches from my wrist and terribly uncomfortable.  It felt like a heavy, cheaply made product, not soft at all and the stitching was terrible.  Threads everywhere and the zipper was loose, I'm guessing it would have lasted a week at best.  I returned it immediately.  I would HIGHLY recommend you look elsewhere for an ARMY shirt.
B00LJZ4S4Y|3|Top fit great, bottoms too small.
B008OT66WK|5|I got this for my son for x-mas, and it looks good on him. Also it keeps him warm. My wife loves it.
B008LWVZA8|4|For Halloween this year I went as Burt Macklin, Chris Pratt's alter-ego on the NBC show Parks and Recreation. I'm certainly not a stickler (and apparently FBI jackets are impossible to find anyway?!), so this worked perfectly. It was comfortable throughout the night, and it has stayed together fairly well. I've actually worn it out as a light jacket earlier this winter.
B00FB88FCQ|3|The top is very pretty and looks great with the black bikini bottoms.  The top is a very tight snug fitting top.  Hugs to your body.  Though it does have a tummy toner in suit, which is probably why it fits so snug.  Had to return for larger size, and larger size fits real snug too.  But the top is very pretty looking if you dont mind a snug tight fit.
B00AHOQ9TA|5|These sleepers are great for any newborn. My son has been wearing the 0-3 since birth. He's 2 mos now and they are still roomy enough. A great buy!
B000M68KSG|4|I traded in my Levi's several years ago and started buying Wranglers.  Never look back.  More accurate fit, better quality control, and fits better in all the right places.
B009E8983O|5|i dont know much about waist training but i believe i picked a good corset for starters. it looks way better than the picture. the fabric is very sturdy, came before expected time and the price is very reasonable. came in a nice lil zipper mesh :)
B008CQG35U|4|My son is usually a MM, but I went with a MXL, because of the length. I could have gotten away with a ML, but that would have been shorter than desired. This size sits just below the waist. It is loose around the armpits, but it looks great.
B004PA1ULO|4|The quality of the print is wonderful. However order a size down. The shirt was rather large. Love the product still!
B009CJVGBW|5|No complaints here
B000FBSP7E|4|This is a great item for summer/spring wear, the compartments for storage are great and it delivers in what it claims to be able to do. my only point to bring to folks attention is that it is a very light weight sweatshirt, keep that in mind and you'll love this! I use mine for hikes, it easily and comfortably stores my gps, sansa and water bottle!
B00HRAXN4Q|5|I love them.. this is my second purchase. They fit perfectly and wear very well.. no slipping off my heal like other no-show socks.
B00K0C9Z72|5|Looks good but comes a bit smaller
B00QQ8TN9E|3|I bought 0-3 moths and the bodysuits were 3-6 months, the other items were ok.
B00QIEYC6U|3|great for school.  the seams on the top of the sock (around the ankle) are all coming unstitched.  I'm fine with it because they are just for school
B00KQFS9WU|5|I really like how this looks on my husband. The fabric is nice and soft and it held up really well after multiple washings.
B00B1ZMFJM|4|It fits me *well*, haha.  Yeah it's a bit tight on me but it does fit and looks pretty good but definitely not something I'd wear to work.  This is prowling clothing.
B00AHCKFQK|5|Thanks for the nice product.
B00IUVNGHU|5|Very nice dress.  Its comfy too.<br />Non-wrinkle and can be worn in<br />Every season.  Way hip, loves.
B0091IAZU2|4|This was a gift to my mom, she is 82 yrs old and I wanted to prevent falls.  She really like them.
B00KOOM7NA|3|It's heavier than I want in a sleeveless dress, much more like a sweater dress and it's very clingy all the way to the bottom.  It's a nice dress but not for me - it's going back.
B00L66KZRA|4|I love the feel of these its like a soft T-shirt material. When I took them out the packaged they looked really wide,but the colors are very pretty. As far as the size goes when I first put them on It was low in the back and low in the front I wasn't sure they were going to stay up. However after a couple of hours on I could pull them up more then they fit better. Not sure if I would buy them again but I will use them since I have them.
B000MX3ROQ|3|The sizes run small.  It is good quality, but get the next size up. It is soft to the touch.
B00OURQFVW|2|Top is too small. I normally wear a med or large. So after reading reviews I purchase xl but it's still too small. Wish could have it in larger sizes probably xxxl. It's cute thou. Can't return it so will donate. I'm sad coz bought it for a white party which is soon but can't wear it now.
B00Y6ZPZOQ|5|Excellent shirt...I run in the Texas summer and this is not only the look I want but is cool and comfortable, without being sloppy.  I recommend following the advice of the website...this is European styling and assumes an athletic build, so at 6'0&#34; and 175 lbs I usually take a medium, but here I ordered a large and it is perfect.  The wonderful family owned company wants to please you, so just take their advice.  When I ordered, Peter even took the time to email me about sizing...it is gratifying to see such attention to customers in these days of huge impersonal multinationals, so I hope that interested readers give this company their support...the company really does aim to please and is willing to work hard to do that.
B0069VD4R0|5|These are awesome goggles, I purchased them right before a trip and they came very quickly, they look exactly like the picture, the mirror on the lens is really cool. They are super comfortable and don't fog at all. The strap is very comfortable and adjusts nicely. Don't be afraid of the price, they are very very nice. My friend took his $100 spy goggles and they fogged in the first 20 min, and these didn't fog the whole day.
B003AIKMIE|5|I bought these for my 10 month old daughter.  They are very stretchy and light for summer.  They are very long so right now i'm rolling them up and she will be wearing them for a while.  They protect her knees when crawling, but are thin enough to keep her cool.  I am happy with the quality so I'm ordering some in more colors.
B00JKNENII|1|Extremely poor quality material. I highly recommend not purchasing this product.
B00DGOJTMW|5|Modest, slim fitting swim wear.  I'm competing in my first sprint triathlon this summer and so I decided to get a decent pair of swim
B005OFLSZM|3|These are great - comfortable and roomy for the &#34;outdoor plumbing.&#34;  Looks as though excellent workmanship is present.  If one gets into an accident with these on, make sure to carry an ID that says something other than &#34;Tommy Hilfiger.&#34;  Update - Jul2016 If I had a do-over, I would opt for the Hanes briefs.  Although these are comfortable, the other reviews that commented about the waistband are correct - the elastic seems to not hold up very well.  Pilling effect and some fray are evident.  Downgrade from 5 to 3 stars.   fwiw
B00C5IUYCY|5|Favorite jeans.
B007PYCT1C|2|The quality is poor, I don't like it. It doesn't like cotton.
B009TJV6D8|1|This thing is made like total crap.  Took forever to arrive and wasn't worth the wait.  Also doesn't work properly.  Save your money.
B00GV0ZT8G|5|Nice pants, a lil big
B0079289VE|5|For those of us who have no hair and must wear a cap for sun protection, these hats are a great alternative to baseball hats.
B00IU06XQW|5|Husband loved it!!!
B00CBEAT8G|5|like it, but somewhat small for the size, I should have ordered bigger size, but I guess, it is really good for the price
B00631VEBO|3|This is a nice looking nightgown, appears to be well made, but sized TOO BIG!! So huge that the my shoulders go through the neckline.
B00FOSEULI|5|I bought these socks for my son.  He loves them and no more stinky feet or shoes from going sockless. The grip on them is perfect for all day wear with no slipping.  We have tried other brands for more money that lose their shape and slip during use.  These socks are durable and well priced.  The free shipping the Amazon prime was an added bonus.<br />Thank you for a great product.
B00CMF78XS|4|Looks good. It shrank a little in the dryer. But still fits
B00CIEE0UW|1|Feels cheap
B0006JGERI|1|Certainly looks cool in the picture, but when it arrived I was nothing but a disappointed. It's a big, empty plastic shell that digs into your face.  It arrived in a standard brown shipping box, with paper tucked in around it, so it seemed secure.  But when I removed the second box, I noticed that it was a box for a different StarWars helmet altogether.  Not a big deal there, but the bottom front edge of the box was mangled, and since the outer box was fine, the damage obviously occurred before it was shipped.  Which mean someone had to have noticed it before they put it in the bigger brown box, but shipped it anyway.  Then when I removed the helmet from its smaller, mangled box, I noticed that the view shield was a super thin little piece of yellow plastic, kind of like the address-viewing window in the envelopes bills arrive in.  It didn't fit in the lens opening properly, there were gaps around the edges, and it had two cracks in it at the very bottom, one big, one small.  I returned it immediately for a full refund.  I wouldn't recommend this product to anyone, and I think the seller needs to put a more accurate photograph of the product on the ad.
B00EDOA5Z4|5|Bought this as a gift for my sister turning 50 and everyone thought is was awesome!
B00ENLLZ56|5|My husband was very pleased with the pajamas. They fit perfectly and are warm. A good purchase!
B000ZGXFVK|5|The shirt and tie were just as expected.  Great price and shipped quick.  It was perfect for my grandson who wore it to be a ring bearer.  Thank you!
B001VNM61G|5|Have had this wallet since 1/2014 and I have to say it is the best wallet I have ever had in my life! Very durable and stylish! I expect this wallet to outlast other leather wallets I have had by at least 3x, maybe more!
B004B8C2CQ|5|Bought this as Christmas gift for my daughter.  Noticed no evil smells, pulled threads, or color problems.  She loves it (& the other one I got her at same time but from another Amazon supplier & in a different color); feel soft too and both came within time promised (2 days). She's happy, mom's happy: how much better could it be?  Not sure about wearability/durability yet, but I'll swing for 5 stars anyway.  any problems i encountered w/order were due to my own lack of experience in the whole process of online shopping, sending pkgs to address other than shipping address, etc; not Amazon's responsibility.  Would happily recommend items to others. TA!
B000PHANNM|5|This is the best baby sunhat.<br /><br />It has an adjustable strap that cinches around the baby's head so that the sun brim won't fall into the baby's face.  I love the neck coverage in the back too.  The hat also has a strap that you can tie under the baby's chin, but I don't find this necessary with the secure fit of the cinched band around baby's head.<br /><br />The fabric dries quickly too which is good for a day at the pool.<br /><br />This is the only sunhat you'll need for your baby!
B00TJ50UY8|1|Too small
B00HPYVBLG|5|Dress was well fitted and made me look stylish, in a classic way.  The cotton was a good weight, not flimsy.  The belt was a little cheap seeming, but works fine until I can find something else.  Would definitely recommend the dress and the Lindy Bop line.  It was recommended to me by a friend of mine, and I have already recommended it to others.  I will be buying another dress from in the future!
B004BDOPUS|5|No complaints.
B00M3NKBG0|3|WAS WAY TO SMALL! I WERE A XL AND NOT EVEN A 3X FIT IN THIS SHIRT!
B00GBVIUEA|3|These t shirts run big - and the sleeves are big too. I like t-shirts with shorter and tighter sleeves for a modern fit, but mostly loose everywhere else. This shirt is all out roomy. Not bad, but not ideal.
B00ED9LBLG|5|I love everything about this coat. The leather is nice, soft, perfect. Fits great. Looks more expensive than it was. Couldn't be happier with purchase. I am a big fan of &#34;Luxury Lane&#34; BGSD products, it's my 4th jacket this year, I purchased one for each family member.
B0020JR2AK|2|Runs small had to return it<br />more like child sized
B00DM21PLG|4|The onesie and leggings are really nice, specially the leggings. The vest is ok. It's soft but runs a bit larger. I think it will look better once it starts to fit better.
B005GV4OMS|2|They shrunk especially in length now they come above my ankles when standing and is something that bothers me a lot. They run true to size until you wash and dry them. This is the reason I have stopped ordering for Roamans / Woman Within the quality is very poor compared to what it use to be.
B0070QLQ6O|2|Too small and the bill is too hard. I rushed having this shipped only to never actually wear it. Disappointed, but at least it was cheap
B00K1M2B0O|4|I liked the bra a lot. I clicked on the picture of the bra with dark blue cups and the turquoise straps.. I was sent this plum one. I emailed the vendor and only then was told the bra I had clicked on had been discontinued. The picture of the bra I wanted has since been removed but it was a disappointing to not get what I originally wanted and not been advised in advance. I kept the bra because I liked the fit..and needed one, but I wouldn't have ordered this color
B00SS1VO9O|5|A little bigger than a small, still love it. Fast shipping.
B009X5PJR2|4|I got scared with the sizing reviews so I played it safe and ordered 2 sizes up. I wear US medium 5'11 187 lbs. ordered US XL . Excellent on time shipping,  prompt customer service response. The shirt still looks great just somewhat big, should have ordered the US L . Still a good buy though. Oh yeah, the ladies love it!
B00EUKIOGS|5|Fit as expected
B000OF4OLM|5|The products that I bought have reached my expectations.. I look toward to buying more products off of this site..
B00EE16PH8|5|Great Christmas sweater, my roommate loved it.  Looks great on her!  She'll be wearing it to ugly christmas sweater parties for years to come, although I'd say this sweater is more cute than ugly!!
B003B1ZPFU|5|You see what you get. I ordered the 42x34 pair and they fit snuggly without being too bulky or skin tight. the tint on it is perfect and they really do fit nicely. Have already washed them properly (inside out, alone), and the color is real, not one bit of fading. Hopefully you enjoy this product xD
B0094KDJ0A|5|Got this just before vacation and it worked out perfectly. It packed easily, didn't wrinkle and was perfectly comfortable. Also came out the same after a wash.
B00CJ5XJ5C|5|Great packaging. It was a cute shirt but a little tight around the stomach. But Im happy with the purchase.
B00GC2IKZC|2|my socks dont look like the picture, the dots are on the top of the sock, not the bottom and the toe and heel arent like in the picture, they are weird looking not what I expected
B00UMH18FC|4|It is a pretty long skirt and it can trip me sometimes but it fits great maybe a little big but not so much I have to worry about it falling off.
B001AV8H80|5|Exactly what I wanted...exactly when I wanted it.
B00CZ7TVL0|1|The material bunches up in the front of the bra leaving creases that you can see thru your shirt.
B009ND6UOK|5|Awesome!!
B007YUI272|1|Too small...
B0014KZ05K|5|I was impressed by the quality of the material. Light weight fabric which is very comfortable for me. I wear that through the summer season and it's so comfortable that I sometimes forget I'm wearing a high suit.
B0048VFUTS|5|i bought this dress from this seller few months ago for my baby girl... it looks exactly like what you see in the picture.this is a very beautiful dress. i got lots of compliments for this dress. my baby girl looked gorgeous always in this adorable dress.. great seller too...
B005DCX2A0|4|The belt is very sturdy and versatile.  I intend to use both the plaid side and the solid blue side.  I don't see any reason to not buy this belt.  My inspiration for getting this belt was from an outfit I saw on the brook brothers website....of course the belt they were selling cost more than twice as much as this one.  So I really think you're getting a good bang for the buck here.  I scoured the internet for a plaid belt and I am really satisfied with this one.  I only wish it was available in some other colors too.
B00DOJZ90K|5|Not  100% linen pants but I love it.....fits as I expected....will buy again when available ...Thank s amazon as always!
B00A6P5WRA|3|This shirt is plenty long, and the color is true to the picture (I bought beige). I was surprised at the high quality of the stitching, and the construction seems very solid. Unlike some other tanks in this price range, I don't picture this one getting holes in the seams after a few washes. In fact it washed pretty well, though I've only washed it in cold water and never put it in the dryer. That said, there are a few things you should probably know about this shirt if you're thinking of buying one:<br /><br />- At the time of this writing, the description lists this shirt as \\"100% Cotton\\". It's actually 95% cotton and 5% polyester, according to the tag.<br /><br />- The same tag (identifying the brand as 'W for Women', if anyone cares) is actually pretty scratchy. People with very sensitive skin might want to remove it.<br /><br />- After wearing it once it's already started pilling, though it's not particularly noticeable and I'm not convinced it will get worse.<br /><br />I'm happy with it and will probably buy a few more, I'd consider them a pretty good value for the price. For anyone concerned about sizing, I'd say that I bought a size Small and it fits like a typical US Women's Small, but there's not much stretch to it.
B00O8CE22S|3|It run small  and I order a larger size and it was perfect
B00OTFPD6I|2|Size wasn't correct on product
B00INC1JZW|5|Love these! Easily dressed up or down and super flattering! Can't go wrong with Hudson! Sale price makes them even sweeter:)
B00NFXZV1M|5|Great cold weather pants.  Water-proof and comfortable.
B00AJQ159K|5|well
B005KDSM34|2|The fit is terrible, and nothing like what it pictured.  We expected a stretchy tight fit, part of it were and part of it were not as expected.  The back side of these shorts need a woman about 3 times the size of the model to fit as depicted.
B00GF3BBTK|3|I wear extra large so decided to buy a 3x..yet its somewhat small..yet pretty
B0088RG0GA|5|My girlfriend wears this all the time and I love it! She likes it as we'll from what I gather.
B000SKNY9G|5|Hanes makes two kinds of cotton socks - the cheaper, more common version has the 'Hanes' lettering in red under the toe and these Classics have the lettering in gray. The Classics (gray lettering) are a little bit more expensive but much more comfortable - they are worth it! The cotton has a thicker, smoother feel and holds up better through washes. These do not suffer from the stretching, especially at the toe-seam, that the cheaper versions have. They run a little bit smaller and fit a bit more snugly than the cheaper ones, as well.
B00GXTJ95E|5|Richard is not made out at the material it's going to work out right away
B0009JECL0|5|I purchased 3 of these tops and will be purchasing some more.  Very comfortable and easy to take care of.  They do not fit tight on the body.
B00A17JD1E|3|This bra gets the job done, but can get a little uncomfortable.
B00F5TQAUK|5|Great! Got compliments soon as I walked through the door.  They fit well.  Normally, I would take a small but ordered the medium. In single digit temperature my hands did not get cold.  Very sharp looking pair of leather gloves.......  Cat S
B004AM4JK6|5|This hat is very cute and also waterproof.  Looks adorable on little girls.
B00I15LUEG|3|It dosen't really fit my iphone 5c. That's too bad.
B0072ZXY8G|5|Nice shirt
B000CBUHSM|4|Good product. Would buy again.
B000HTJ10O|5|Nice summer shorts! Very comfortable and look good.
B00HTCZ71E|5|Loooove this scarf! It's lightweight. I think it will be great for summer, but the color also makes it great for fall. It's well made, too. Great purchase. Tempted to get it in all colors.
B0051I6MYY|5|Got this for my dad, and he absolutely loves it.  he farms with International equipment so i thought it would be perfect.  He says its comfortable.
B00KGV80LE|4|good product
B00D8E8IMC|5|A real score! The wife loves it! Read the reviews, and make sure you get one size up from what you usually would wear. Other than that you can't complain.
B003824RPG|5|I was looking for a long time for something this good. I love them, they are soft and easy for my son to pun on after restroom breaks. Very nice!
B00QPU71FQ|5|👍
B0007MXZE4|5|The tie came in on time and looked great. The color is what was pictured, and I have no doubt that the sleek look of the tie will make people love it.<br /><br />Quick note: Keep in mind the tie will come in folded so have an iron ready to gently get out the bends of the tie. Cover with a shirt or some thin material to make sure you do not damage the tie.
B004FHRYGW|1|This bra was way too small with no underwire or support.  I sent it back after I couldn't even put it on.
B00JRPW17O|5|Beautiful! It fits perfectly. I'm very excited to wear this product.wonderful service. It's Worth every penny.
B003BQWJS6|4|I have a working man's hands, and these gloves fit my hands a little tight.  Maybe over time they will stretch out a little and fit better, but for now, they are too tight to allow my fingers to go all the way in to them.  The quality seems good, and I can't complain about the warmth.  Gauntlets beat all for not allowing drafts up my sleeves.  Buy if you have fine fingers, or deal with the tight fit.
B00APT8HWO|5|they look great in anything and you cant tell you have them on and they make your butt look great all the time i brought booty pop<br />but it didnt look as real as these
B00ID4RBOS|5|I really like these socks.  I wear a 16 and these are a good fit.  They last a long time too.  This is my 3rd set to order and I really like them.  They are dressy enough for church and casual enough for work.
B00JW7O2K6|1|This is a very cute bra, but it was not made for average chests in my area and I don't think that is clearly stated (or it wasn't at the time of my purchase). It has some lovely lacing, but the cup is the size of the palm of my hand and includes padding. I put it on and literally laughed out loud at the amount of overflow. Nope. Not gonna happen. Also, note that there is a shipping cost to return it.
B0056X6ON8|5|Great shirt quality and price is too good to pass up!  Can't go wrong with poplin/cotton! I bought 4 of these shirts and love them!
B00BM48E92|4|It's OK.
B00IRVYJTW|5|I WEAR M TO L AND THIS FIT GREAT
B005UT442Q|3|This T-shirt I ordered for a gift was just ok.The print was not very clear like the example in the photo they give.The colors are not very bright either. Would not recommend.
B00CL8DK9C|5|Good shirt at a good price
B008R6TL68|5|This was just what I needed. Not low rise. Not regular waist. And the quality is just what I expected from Hanes.
B00G26IO90|4|RUNS SMALL!!  Check the sizes before ordering!  The description says &#34;loose&#34;, it is not loose on me at all.  The arm length could be a bit longer for my liking.
B000L6EQG2|1|This is my second pregnancy and I have bought this product at around 12 weeks. I am very active due to my 3 year old twins and really did not like Belly Ups. I could feel them when I was moving or sitting down and it showed under my fitted tops.
B007PESRR2|4|Good shirts. Due to previous reviews I got size 6 for my nearly 4 year old son (who is on the smaller side). After one wash they have a bit of room to grow- so perfect. Sticky stuff from packaging tape remained on each shirt after wash but came off with some rubbing and picking.  Would recommend, especially for price.
B00JRQU4BI|5|Perfect
B00J0APAJC|5|Luv it
B00B7B0ABK|4|Great bright colour and quite comfortable
B00DVS3XP2|5|I bought this 4-pack of bodysuits because I applique onesies and needed some blanks to work with.  I am already familiar with the Carter's brand, and knew that I would get a great product in these bodysuits.  I wasn't disappointed.  They are easy to work with, thicker than the G [other brand], and super soft.  They appear to be true to size as well.  Loved the colors in this pack and will buy more in the future.
B003LO20KK|5|You can not destroy these shirts, great shirt just wears long
B009SN0HBM|4|it looks and fits better than expected. I would buy another one for sure. its a little thinner than i thought it would be. but i like it.
B00GS16JA0|5|You can never go wrong with a shirt from The Mountain, they are great quality and hold up great!  This was a gift for a Pit Bull owner and she absolutely loved it!
B00JBFCRTW|3|I love the Jesus piece. the chain complemented the pendant excellent.  however the pendant was too simple and lack craftsmanship.
B002BMHTU4|5|I bought these XL Tall tees to sleep in, as I am always borrowing my husband's & they are not long enough. I was very happy to see how soft & comfortable these are. I have washed them many times & they keep their shape & softness...best value anywhere!
B00K0OU5V0|3|The product is ok. Material feels nice. I'm not a big person but i am in good physical shape and wear size large on my other tank-tops and they are snug after washing. I can't say the same for these.  They are not what I expected and I'm always disappointed with the fit on my body frame.  It may just be me but I won't be buying this again.
B00FQVFDV4|4|I got this for my daughter and she loves it. Nice material for the price. A lot fabric to make different styles.
B00H7U0P06|5|I have been having trouble finding pants that fit and this are perfect.  Comfortable and look great.
B00F3KCCEE|5|This case is perfect to carry virtually any type/style of eyeglasses.  Extremely well-constructed and proportioned.  It even passed the \\"wife test\\":  After seeing mine, I had to buy one for her, as well....
B00ET1V65E|3|Wife here. I bought these using the size chart provided, and they're very big on me. I'll have to reorder them at least one size smaller. I do like the feel of the fabric, though. The colors I received are taupe, light pink and a light brown print.
B0031U0PVU|1|The buckle on this belt broke the first time I tried it on. I should have payed more attention to the negative reviews on this item. Don't risk your time and money on this belt; go with a different brand. The goal of this company is to make a buckle that lasts just slightly longer than the return period so you get caught with your pants down.
B005KQG8UU|4|I love how cute & comfy these are.The shorts a very short & it's very soft & warm material.I had been looking for a Hello Kitty pajama & since Summer is coming I decided to buy these.It's true to  size.I'm very pleased =)
B00P8KMOPQ|5|Love
B00KXATM24|5|This was a perfect fit#!!
B00J4UF728|5|Love it
B00TOWLA0E|2|They were a boy's small.
B004A7XY84|5|Have worn this brand and style of panties for over 60 years.  They fit as expected without binding and the cotton makes them much more comfortable to wear in the southern heat.
B00D3YNPFM|2|I ordered a pair of Amour leggings in camo and they fit awesome!  So i ordered 3 more pairs.  Of the three, only 1 pair fit.  The other two were extremely small!  At least the seller was easy to deal with :)
B00GRINDIK|5|Easily exchanged...x large for large.  The large is a little large as well...but I will keep it...Nice Jacket and a good value for the price paid.
B000792Z7U|5|I really like this ID holder.  The string is a little long, but that's easily changed by tying a knot in it.  It's durable, has a lot of room for money and things in addition to the plastic pocket up front for your ID.  Highly recommended!
B0007YR9M6|5|Delivered as expected and product was as seller described.
B00DZI1VAM|5|Perfect fit
B00D3EPELU|4|I bought this as a photo prop for my daughter. It fits great (true to size), and looks great. I used it in a pic with a bunch of apples, and it looks adorable. Only downside is it faded when I washed it, still red but definitely faded. If worn outside, it would definitely keep my little one warm.
B00N27SRA8|2|Skirt runs small. I ordered  according to the measurement chart on the order page. I am a size 12 but to be safe i ordered a large. Its pretty tight. I cant wear it now. Hope to be able to by summer. Fits like its a size 10. It reminds me of something you would buy in the 1980s. Its fun but just runs very small
B002NGSXMG|3|Size was fine and what I expected.  But, after a first wash, one of the leg seams came loose.  Not good.
B00G52EOOK|5|Volt Ice was a little more greenish yellow than in the picture but overall good shirt
B0017GVPIW|4|Got this for my special needs daughter. Easier for her. Only wish Champion would make it a larger size for more freedom of movement.
B00075ZYRC|5|Nice quality shirt, fits well.
B00DRGJTL0|4|They fit well, and they look so cute. The only thing I could complain about is that the color of the &#34;mint&#34; ones looks a bit different in person than they do on my screen. I will likely buy more of these, they are very comfortable.
B00CD7G8BS|3|Got 2 small holes within a very short time.
B0064YYBBK|3|The shipping and delivery service was awesome! Unfortunately the garment wasn't what I was hoping for. The quality and fit through the body was fine, however, the chest region (34C) gave my breasts a very odd and pointy shape...reminded me of Madonna in Vogue :) It's a nice garment just not the look I was going for. Sadly I had to return this purchase.
B00V64L3DC|5|You will need help putting it on for the first time but after that it gets easier, as long as you stick with your diet. I'm on the second notch now! You really work up a sweat when you're working out. It really helps to suppress your appetite too!
B001CB1NG6|4|Warm and cozy, looks more extensive than it was. Great for southern California winters (40-50 degrees)
B002ZVBIOE|5|Nice. I liked.
B002TQ7916|5|Like the roomy vest.
B008QVFHTY|5|this is my first ever fur coat and the feel is like nothing i've ever experienced in my life. there isn't anything that can compare to the feeling of it next to my skin. just amazing!!!!
B00EKIQ8FO|5|My wife loved this shirt if fits her as expected
B00AGAJMCG|5|Very Nice.
B00D4BEG8O|4|Sizing chart was right on the money. Im usually hesitant on ordering clothes for me online but im glad I did.
B00LH0OZJE|5|For anyone looking to have support and comfort simultaneously.
B002TNQAJQ|5|Love it. fits great.
B00A7URGIC|5|Adorable!!
B005CKH362|4|This is a beautiful costume. I really like the detailing on the dress. The only complaint is that the fabric is a bit see-thru. I would definitely recommend a slip underneath.
B00BFHDDY2|4|I've been searching for crew length mostly cotton socks and these fit the bill. Their tags say 80% cotton, the colors are bright and fun, and they are comfortable. They are a little snug on the leg, but I think that will help them stay up. If they were a little thicker, they'd be perfect, but I can see my toes a tiny bit through them. I'm hoping that despite that fact, they will last a while.<br />For the price, I am very very happy!<br />Oh, and they shipped super fast; I got them in 2 days.<br /><br />UPDATE 2/24.<br />These lose 1 star right now but might lose more as time passes. I have probably worn the pair I put on this morning at the MOST 3 times. There are small HOLES around 4 of the flowers. I wash in cold water and dry on medium. They are still wearable for around the house, but are a big disappointment in quality. I'm hoping this pair is a a fluke and not the standard. I will update with any other issues if they come up.
B00IA2LIB0|5|Awesome product!!! It's made well and worth the buy!!!!
B0044BRUG8|5|Great winter socks. This brand never disappoints
B00076ZRQY|3|Good for the price.  Fitting is a little big. I still like it!
B00BJQGLQ6|4|The fit is a bit strange. According to the size chart, I needed a small in the bust and a large in the waist and hips, which I knew didn't make sense for my body. But I ordered the large. It turned out that the bust fit perfectly and the waist and hips had to be taken in. Also it is very low cut, so keep that in mind, especially if you are busty! However, the dress is beautiful and will be perfect for my sister's wedding.
B001FTNF2A|5|Super fast delivery.  Great costume for great price. Need this for a play and colors are even brighter than the picture so I am very pleased.
B00H07HOT6|5|The glasses came sooner than expected! Customer service was very nice and helpful - I enjoy how the glasses look and the quality of them as well!!  I really suggest buying these to complete your cosplay!
B00MSJFSJO|5|She loved the shirts!
B008EENVOQ|4|Very cute and kept my hands warms and dry during an entire day of snowboarding!
B00H32OGQW|4|size was not what I expected
B00BY6GX2S|3|This was bought for my daughter for our wedding, and she seemed to enjoy it quite a bit. There were no washing instructions on it, so it did bleed. Probably should've had it dry cleaned.
B000I59UPI|4|IT WASN'T WHAT I WAS LOOKING FOR BUT IT WAS SO NICE I KEPT IT ANYWAY!
B00IOPQRM8|3|Gave to my neice
B00BKULYMC|5|excellent. Very fun to wear!  Great quality, I bought two one for me and one for my sister and we are both very happy!
B004Y533YW|5|Perfect fit on both bottom and top. True to size. Just as seller described. IT was actually a prettier color than the picture. The material is actually pretty nice and soft. I mean for the price your paying you get a really good product! Too bad its a &#34;wear for a few minutes&#34; outfit if you get my meaning :)
B003U2TCZY|5|My husband loved this shirt. I wore the dress that matches the shirt.  We looked so cute. I loved it.
B0093E98O8|4|The inside was pink color and tacky
B0041U1VOY|4|i need a large, medium is...ok
B005H2533K|3|I gave this shirt a 3 star rating because there appears to be a problem with the sizing.  I had ordered an XL and received what can only be a medium sized shirt.  While I do know that sizes vary between manufacturers, designers, etc., there was just too much of a size discrepancy.  Could the problem be with the manufacturer sewing in wrong sizes?  Could be.  Did the vendor misrepresent the sizing of the shirts?  Maybe.  The short of it is, ask questions people!  Lesson learned!  LOL
B00F9RZ4SC|5|This robe was just as advertised.  Looks exactly as displayed.  Comfy, warm and perfect for my granddaughter.  She is very artistic and would never like a plain bathrobe.  If you look closely, the pockets are heart shaped too. Nice detail.  Quality of this product is excellent.
B00GIG2V9S|5|Lots of compliments on this dress.  I love it!
B00JH0RWYQ|5|I have fairly wide hips so I bought this in a medium. It is actually a little loose around the hips but it does stay up. I'm 5'6 and this reaches comfortably to the floor. It is a little wider toward the bottom than most maxi skirts, which gives it a really flattering loose A-line fit which moves nicely as you walk. The fabric is stretchy and hangs smoothly, but it is fairly lightweight and not at all see through.<br /><br />I absolutely recommend this skirt, I haven't found another maxi which is such great quality for such a low price.
B006NO99DQ|5|This scarf adds texture to my wardrobe and has a nice feminine feel to it.  It's very light in weight, comfortable, and soft.
B00JEWO5OC|4|nice
B00NHG60OE|5|Thanks
B000OIH8QC|3|I really liked it, but I feel like I probably shouldn't have paid over $1,000 on a costume.  To be fair though, it was pretty great.
B00D4EKVXK|2|When the purse arrived, I immediately regretted my purchase.  The beads were overly gaudy.
B008F6GLDG|5|Excellent product
B0063AS8IC|3|I have been looking for a boiled wool jacket for my very petite mother for a long time.  When I saw this, I knew it was the one for her and luckily it came in petite sizes, so I ordered a petite small which is what she normally wears. (Even so, many times the sleeves are still too long, but these looked as though they could be altered.)  This was a Christmas gift and we were both SO pleased by the quality, style and workmanship.  It is really a beautiful garment. HOWEVER, it was so small, she could not even begin to get her arms in the sleeves.  I don't see how even the skinniest teenager could wear that size.  I was afraid to order another size to try, so ended up returning it.  This was a major disappointment, especially since the quality of workmanship was so beautiful.
B00EHLKRBU|5|Very tight fitting. I recommend going one size larger than your norm. This shirt is perfect for trying to show off your waist.
B00DUW4VAK|5|I love my dress! I thought it was gone fit to small because I order an large but it's fitted just a little thin but that's all
B008A5967U|3|Waited till almost the last minute to get a dress for my son's wedding. Reluctantly went to David's and found a dress that I loved, only it was not the right color. I needed it in silver. As it was marked down in price, they could not order it in the color I needed. So, back to the drawing board. But wait..... there it is on line and in the color I need. I ordered the same dress from Amazon.com in the color I needed for half the price and it actually shipped from David's. Received it yesterday and it is BEAUTIFUL. Hmmm....go figure.
B004SDX3LI|5|they are very good<br />I have not objections yet<br />I like the old version with label in the League<br />I would recommend this
B00TZAIIHI|5|Absolutely loved every item I ordered !!!
B00HV3HER6|5|I've gotten a million compliments on these - from people who don't even know who Gustav Klimt IS.<br /><br />Something else amazing about these pants - they seem to be engineered to avoid camel toe.  I don't know how that's possible, but the way the seams are in the pants makes it a non-issue. I know that sounds crude, but let's be real, it's a struggle with some of these tights.
B00MZHSTV8|5|These kept me very warm hiking in the Smoky Mountains, in temperatures ranging from 20 to 40 degrees F.  And the price was much lower than anything I could have gotten at an outdoor gear store!
B008TN56JK|5|This swimsuit is amazing. Everyone tells me how cute my bikini is. Super cute and fits perfect. My suggestion to buyers is to choose the size based on the bottom size you need. You can always adjust the top but the bottoms just make it on covering all thats necessary, so there is no room to be a size off.
B003IDVIOI|3|I bought this dress last year and had to return it as it was very, very short on me. I'm five feet, five inches tall. In it, I couldn't (as my grandfather would say) &#34;pick up any pennies.&#34;
B00QR6DAHG|1|I was So disappointed when these came!! Not at all like advertised! Very small, and not infinitity scarfs at all! More like the size of a handkerchief, did not even fit around my neck, nor were the ends connected! Do not buy if you expect to use as an infinitity scarf!
B0030Y31K4|4|This item arrived on time but was to small. Seems to run small, which is noted in others comments/reviews. Thankfully I gave it to my daughter rather than ship it back. Seems to but well made. Might order it in a bigger size.
B00FQASSP8|2|There are about the right size for the seven dwarfs, about 70% size of a normal handkerchief, And they are amazingly thin - almost transparent. These would be good to make a hoochy-kooch costume, teeny and see-through. Especially if you like white. The photo shows colored hankys, but most of the box is actually white, and off-white, and pale grey. They look old and dirty right from the start!
B003VZCO1E|5|this is a great fit and great for t-shirts. I would recommend this to any women looking for a bra with support and no padding.
B002FU63AE|5|looks great, fits great
B00MAGLW3Q|4|I found the fit and finish of this shirt to be of good quality.  I bought the orchid color which is a deep purple as it appears online.
B00OV1RCXC|3|I wanted to love it, but it just looked boxy on me...
B0091U2V66|5|This top is perfect with a bandeau or colorful tank top underneath.  From the front it looks like a regular black sleeveless top, and then...turn around and there is an amazing skull cut out!  Fits pretty much true to size.  The cutout would expose a bra strap or bandeau, but that can be worked to its advantage to make a cool summer look!
B0055MR1I2|3|This shirt was small for a size 7 and the tie was very short.  My child is averaged sized and usually wears 6-8, and it was definitely too small for him.
B000PQDZLK|5|product met my expectations and the price was reasonable.
B00PLFDLUU|5|Great!
B00EIDUTGK|5|I love this sweater and have worn it at least 6 times already since I bought it. I had no problems with smell or anything else that was mentioned. Fits me perfectly and is warm and not see through like some sweaters are for the same price
B003KJA28S|5|I bought this shirt for my nephew and was little worried about the size. But alas it fits perfectly for him! He loved the design since he plays bass at his church.
B001CP1OCA|5|I bought this for my husband, who teaches math.  He loves it.
B003ZOS6Q8|5|Looks good, fits good what can I say... my feet are happy.
B002GHC1Q6|5|really like them
B00IOAOLS0|2|I am 5'1&#34; and I need a maxi skirt, which is what I thought I was ordering.  But it came to my knees, and the people who had made it said it was made by Chinese sizes.  I donated it to a good cause..
B007XVVMKG|5|This skirt is perfect!!!
B007SPIJ6C|5|I am 5' 9&#34; and 130 lbs -the xs tall fits perfectly. Cherokee is the only brand that doesn't look like highwaters with my danskos.  They are 34 inches long while most other tall pants are 33&#34;. That one inch makes a huge difference for us tall people.
B00RR075XG|5|Cute shirt Better in  Person
B00B1P3S52|4|Well cut given the unusual size and fit very well in both directions.  I would consider additional purchases from this source.
B00012O1F2|5|I purchased these jeans for my husband and he loved them!  These are hard-to-find 35x30 and they are a perfect fit.  Seller has a quality product and ships the items out fast!!!  Very happy with purchase!
B004O5JLCA|5|Love it. Smooths without discomfort. Worn in combination with Squeem &#34;Perfect Waist&#34; Firm Compression Waist Cincher Shapewear, and my clothes have never fit better. I will be buying another once I've lost more weight, in a smaller size. Great aid for a slimming look and comfortable enough even to wear with anything.  I sit at a desk all day. I only remember I'm wearing it because my jeans fit better.
B001RFMYWY|3|Did not realize this package was 3 pr all white and 3 pr with color stripe.  Needed all 6 pr to be white for school uniform dress code.  Oh well.......
B007Z0YPA4|5|I got her other stuff, but this she totally loved it. You can't really see it in the pictures, but the scarf has little silver shiny stuff in it. The scarf works really well, and looks great.<br /><br />If you like scarfs, this one is a must have.
B0043U34OC|1|Elastic does not hold, and wore a pair one time (while at work)  and the seam on the toe came right out. Would not recommend these socks, even if you get them for free.
B00D1R820O|5|This just arrived today, much sooner than expected. If I have any issues with wear and tear I'll update my review. I only wore it for an hour because I didn't want to push my luck, since this is the first one I've ever worn. Seems sturdy enough even though I strained it to the limit because I deliberately ordered it small and had to unlace it almost completely to get it on.
B007HCIDQW|2|I gave it 2 stars because, while it is made well, the fit is off.  the body is very long and the bra part is oddly squared.
B00LFW9AHQ|5|I ordered a size 32 for my 11 year old daughter who typically wears a size 12 pant and 14/XL tops (her upper body is long).  It fits her well but isn't so tight she doesn't have a little growing room.  Color is brighter then the picture shows, which she loves.
B001LNGDGU|5|The sizing is accurate and the quality is standard for these types of shirts also known as &#34;wife beaters&#34;. Nothing to complain about at all, you get what you see pretty much.
B007OX0QN2|5|my husband loves it
B00QF6BH82|5|Perfect. Exactly what I was looking for. Credit cards fit in nicely and easy to get in and out.
B000X1PPTC|5|Great work bibs for a great price!!Thanks
B00BZ5UW0C|3|The neck part is a little too short, but in my opinion, it's an okay looking Michael Myers Mask.<br />This version is from 2013. It fits my head really good. This mask will fit an adult with an average size head, but might be a little bit large for some children. For me, it wasn't hard to see out of this mask, and I also had no problems breathing out of it either.<br /><br />Feel free to ask me any questions in the Comment section. I usually answer all questions on the same day. :)
B00JEUONR8|3|Love this shirt but it runs a size too small. So if you wear a medium I would buy a large.
B00GNC699U|5|I own 5 of the thinner versions of this belt with the &#34;snapping&#34; buckle. This belt is wider, more substantial, and the buckle is larger. As such, this is a great belt for jeans and heavier pants. The other, lighter versions are good for shorts. This buckle holds more firmly and is quite solid. Great belt!!
B00TKPNUYY|5|Great dress, very comfortable and perfect for hot summer days.
B007GB5W4U|5|Love Leveret PJs.  We haven't found one yet (and we have 4 pair) that we don't think is cute and well-made!
B00DJ5HBYQ|5|Awesome shirt. My wife loved it for my son.
B000CSX9SK|4|The panties I ordered were as described and the fit was good. I will most likely order more of them as I can't find this style in any stores. One of the panties has to be repaired after one wearing, as the elastic at the leg opening separated from the pantie. When it was sewn, the maker didn't quite catch the fabric. This is just a small flaw and it will not keep me from ordering again.
B0052GJSX2|3|Fabric is thin
B008ARISZY|5|amazing hat I saw some of the bad reviews and was hesitant of buying but hat is adjustable and looks really nice I haven't made a review on many of the products I have bought but this one I have to liked it so much I'm buying other colors
B002FC67DK|5|Great shirt
B00N580OT6|2|tag said 2x but more likely is a extra large or large.gave to my wife.good otherwise
B00FS704GU|5|good
B0016C2YU0|5|Nice Shirt
B004494MXE|1|Don't buy....This shirt is a joke. It is as thin as panty hose and much smaller than average sizes.  More like children's sizes. Very transparent and flimsy. Sent it back immediately.
B00LP903J8|4|This blazer is a pretty nice product at this price point, where it's somewhat hard to find a blazer that's not a wool/poly blend.  The fabric feels nice and looks nice, and it has good buttons.  The shoulders were a slight bit tight on me, so I returned it.  I wish it would have fit.
B000NGA5YC|4|Shirt looks good, its a tighter fit not lose. Color is very dark and looks almost black in some angles.
